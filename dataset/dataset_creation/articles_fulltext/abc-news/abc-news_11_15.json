Still, any mention of weapons testing could influence the direction of stalled diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Washington and aimed at ridding the North of its nuclear weapons.\n\nThe North hasn't publicly tested any weapons since November 2017, but in recent days Pyongyang reportedly expressed anger at U.S.-led international sanctions and ongoing small-scale military drills between South Korea and the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea's Foreign Ministry warned it could bring back its policy of bolstering its nuclear arsenal if it doesn't receive sanctions relief.\n\n\"It's North Korea-style coercive diplomacy. North Korea is saying 'If you don't listen to us, you will face political burdens,'\" said analyst Shin Beomchul of Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nDiplomacy has stalled since a summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in June, with Washington pushing for more action on nuclear disarmament and the North insisting that the U.S. first approve a peace declaration formally ending the Korean War and lift sanctions.\n\nShin said the weapon North Korea tested could be a missile, artillery, an anti-air gun, a drone or other high-tech conventional weapons systems.\n\nYang Wook, a Seoul-based military expert, said a \"tactical weapon\" in North Korea refers to \"a weapon aimed at striking South Korea including U.S. military bases\" there, so the North may have tested a short-range missile or a multiple rocket launch system.\n\nEven if the test was a message for Washington and Seoul, Friday's report from the North was noticeably less belligerent than past announcements of weapons tests, and didn't focus on North Korean claims of U.S. and South Korean hostility.\n\nYang said the latest North Korean test won't completely break down nuclear diplomacy, though more questions would be raised about how sincere the North is about its commitment to denuclearization.\n\nAsked about the test, the U.S. State Department said that American and North Korean officials are talking about implementing the commitments that Trump and Kim made during their June meeting in Singapore. Eugene Lee, spokeswoman of South Korea's Unification Ministry, declined to comment on Kim's inspection of the weapons test.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, attending a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore, cited the \"great progress\" made on North Korea but said more had to be done.\n\nA year and a half ago, \"nuclear tests were taking place, missiles were flying over Japan and there were threats and propagations against our nation and nations in the region,\" Pence said.\n\n\"Today, no more missiles are flying, no more nuclear tests, our hostages have come home, and North Korea has begun anew to return fallen American heroes from the Korean War to our soil. We made great progress but there's more work to be done,\" he said.\n\nPence stressed that U.N. sanctions had to remain enforced.\n\nIt's the first publicly known field inspection of a weapons test by Kim Jong Un since he observed the testing of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile in November of last year, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry.\n\nThe North said the test took place at the Academy of National Defense Science and that Kim couldn't suppress his \"passionate joy\" at its success. He was described as \"so excited to say that another great work was done by the defense scientists and munitions industrial workers to increase the defense capability of the country.\"\n\nLast year's string of increasingly powerful weapons tests, many experts believe, put the North on the brink of a viable arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles that can target anywhere in the mainland United States.\n\nTrump and Kim are both interested in another summit, but it's unclear when it might happen. Pence has said the next meeting would allow the two leaders to put what they discussed in their last summit on paper.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, Annabelle Liang in Singapore and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Arkansas man pleads not guilty to threatening Don Lemon", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The VA already is using meditation, yoga and similar approaches to supplement traditional therapy with PTSD, said Paula Schnurr, executive director of the VA's National Center for PTSD.\n\nWhile the three-month study adds to evidence supporting these lifestyle practices, Schnurr said, more research is needed to learn how long meditation's benefits last.\n\n\"There's no follow-up in this study,\" Schnurr noted, and one therapist did 80 percent of the exposure therapy so the findings hinge largely on one therapist's skills.\n\nResearchers measured symptoms in about 200 San Diego area veterans randomly assigned to one of three groups. Some learned to meditate. Others got exposure therapy. The third group attended classes where they learned about nutrition and exercise.\n\nAll sessions were once a week for 90 minutes.\n\nAfter three months, 61 percent of the meditation group improved on a standard PTSD assessment, compared to 42 percent of those who got exposure therapy and 32 percent of those who went to classes. When researchers accounted for other factors, meditation was better than the classes and equally effective as exposure therapy.\n\nThe researchers defined success as at least a 10-point improvement in scores on a standard symptoms test, given to participants by people who did not know which kind of treatment they'd received. The test measures symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia.\n\nPTSD also can be treated with medications or other types of talk therapy. Many of the participants were taking prescribed medicine for PTSD.\n\nMost of the vets were men with combat-related trauma, so it's not clear whether meditation would be equally effective in women or with other types of trauma.\n\nThere's growing interest in meditation in the United States. A government survey last year found 14 percent of adults said they had recently meditated, up from 4 percent from a similar survey five years earlier.\n\nThere are many styles of meditation. The type taught to vets in the study was transcendental meditation, or TM, which involves thinking of a mantra or sound to settle the mind.\n\nTM was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a guru to the Beatles in the late 1960s. Some of the study authors are affiliated with a university in Fairfield, Iowa, founded by Maharishi. Their role was to oversee the meditation training.\n\nRutledge, who was the principal researcher, said he does not practice meditation himself.\n\nMeditation could be more acceptable to veterans who might associate mental health treatment with weakness, Rutledge said.\n\n\"It's probably less threatening,\" he said. \"It may be easier to talk to veterans about participating in something like meditation.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Carla K.

No cause has been determined, but speculation has centered on PG&E, which reported an outage around when and where the fire ignited.\n\nThe company has lost $15 billion in market value, its shares plummeting 60 percent in a week.\n\nPG&E already faced financial pressure from its suspected role in a series of deadly fires in California wine country last year. The company's filing last month said it needed to boost revenue to keep investors from fleeing, noting that its credit rating was downgraded and its shares had plummeted since the 2017 fires.\n\nWildfires threaten PG&E's ability to attract and maintain the investment necessary to support its system and meet California's clean energy goals, company spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo said.\n\n\"PG&E's electrical system is not immune from the impact of increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather,\" Paulo said.\n\nCalifornia Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker sought to calm financial markets late Thursday with a statement noting \"an essential component of providing safe electrical service is the financial wherewithal to carry out safety measures.\" But he added that he's expanding an investigation of PG&E's safety culture to look at the company's \"corporate governance, structure and operation.\"\n\nPG&E shares rebounded in after-hours trading, regaining Thursday's losses but remaining far below their value when the fire broke out.\n\nThe company said in its rate-hike request that the extreme wildfire risk justified a higher profit than an average utility is allowed to earn. It cites a California legal standard holding utilities entirely liable for damage caused by their equipment regardless of whether the company was negligent.\n\nA state law approved this year makes it easier for the company to raise rates to pay off lawsuits, but the company says it still faces high risk and got no relief for fires that started this year.\n\nThe precipitous drop in the stock price shows investors are taking into account not just the fires but also the risk of future wildfires for which the utility could be responsible, analysts said.\n\n\"It's going to be very difficult for PG&E to finance its needs in the short run, so we think at this point, regulators need to step in and give the market some reassurance,\" said Travis Miller, a strategist at Morningstar.\n\nPG&E is asking for a 9.5 percent increase in transmission charges \u2014 the cost of high-voltage lines that move power across large distances. That amounts to about $1.50 more per month for the average residential customer, Paulo said.\n\nAdvocates for utility customers have balked at PG&E's contention that it needs to raise rates because of wildfires. They say its problems are the result of poor management decisions.\n\n\"We don't pay electric bills in order to keep bailing PG&E out from its own negligence and incompetence, and we can't afford it,\" said Mindy Spatt, communications director for The Utility Reform Network.\n\nPG&E reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission this week that it had renewed its insurance coverage for wildfires to about $1.4 billion for the year covering this fire season. But an analyst at Citi Investment Research estimated damages could exceed $15 billion. And the company's potential liability for last year's fires has been pegged at upward of $10 billion.\n\nSome analysts believe PG&E will be able to survive financially as long as there isn't another major catastrophe. But wildfires are getting bigger, deadlier and more destructive as housing pushes into rural areas and drought and high temperatures tied to climate change become the norm.\n\n\"The business doesn't earn enough money to pay for that in any kind of regular way,\" said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University. \"These have to be extreme, once-in-a-generation events.\"\n\nPG&E's ability to raise capital will be constrained, so it will probably be forced to cut back on expenses such as replacing aging equipment, analysts said. California utilities also need to invest in the type of upgrades that will allow the state to meet its aggressive renewable energy and carbon reduction goals.\n\nFire investigators have blamed PG&E equipment for 12 of last year's wildfires, including two that killed 15 people combined. In eight of those fires, investigators said they found evidence of violations of state law and forwarded the findings to prosecutors.\n\nThe company is facing dozens of lawsuits from insurers and people who lost their homes in last year. And a lawsuit this week blames PG&E for the latest fire, accusing the company failing to effectively maintain power lines.\n\nCalifornia regulators generally allow utilities to pass on the costs of those lawsuits to their customers, but only if the company can show it prudently managed its equipment. The new state law makes it easier for utilities to bill customers if they can show a fire got worse from things outside their control, like severe weather. But lawmakers didn't drop the standard that puts all the liability on the utility, which is unique to two states.\n\n\"Very large damage payments of the size faced by California utilities are very unusual in other states,\" said Hugh Wynne of Sector and Sovereign Research, an investment research firm.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBussewitz reported from New York."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Diddy's former girlfriend and mother to 3 children dies", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Ask most people, and if they're old enough to remember anything at all, it's that famous photo of the doomed candidate with a smiling Donna Rice in his lap, on perhaps the most unfortunately named yacht in American political history: \u2026 [+5825 chars]", "fulltext": "Hey, remember Gary Hart?\n\nAsk most people, and if they're old enough to remember anything at all, it's that famous photo of the doomed candidate with a smiling Donna Rice in his lap, on perhaps the most unfortunately named yacht in American political history: \"Monkey Business.\"\n\nWhat most people don't recall, or never even knew, is that the photo emerged two weeks after the 1987 scandal had ended in Hart's withdrawal from the Democratic race, his hugely promising political career destroyed over suspicions \u2014 never confirmed \u2014 that he'd had an affair with Rice.\n\nThe fact that people assume the photo led to Hart's humiliating downfall is just one of many ways in which the whole ordeal is mis-remembered, says Jason Reitman, director of \"The Front Runner,\" which stars Hugh Jackman in an appropriately tense, anguished turn as the Colorado senator who rose fast and fell faster.\n\n\"The story really plays with our sense of memory,\" Reitman says. \"First people recall 'Monkey Business,' so they're remembering a joke, and then it's, what was that blonde's name?\"\n\nThe fact that Rice was a human being (also a Phi Beta Kappa college grad) and not just a blonde on a boat is one point that \"The Front Runner,\" based on a 2014 book by journalist Matt Bai, seeks to drive home. But the larger point is that the Hart saga, far from a party joke, marked a watershed moment in American politics and culture, with reverberations that continue to this day.\n\nWhy? Because it was the moment when politicians became celebrities, and their private lives became our public business, even our property, Bai argues. It changed political journalism, too, he says, and created a different kind of candidate, perhaps forever.\n\n\"It's this moment in 1987 when the worlds of politics and entertainment collide,\" says Bai, who co-wrote the screenplay with Reitman and former political operative Jay Carson. \"And when you create a process for selecting leaders that treats them like celebrities, you inevitably attract celebrities to your process. So it's supremely relevant.\" The reference to a certain current American leader is implicit.\n\nA quick historical primer: Hart was way ahead in the polls to take the 1988 Democratic nomination and face GOP nominee George H.W. Bush. But rumors of marital infidelity arose, and a tip led Miami Herald reporter Tom Fiedler to stake out an alley near Hart's Washington townhouse, where the 29-year-old Rice, with whom Hart had connected on a Bahamas cruise, was believed to be staying. Fiedler and his team confronted Hart. He refused to answer questions about his private life. Soon after, amid unrelenting scrutiny on his family, he quit the race.\n\nHart wasn't exactly the first American politician to be felled by a sex scandal \u2014 seen \"Hamilton,\" anyone? \u2014 but before him, routine sexual peccadilloes were usually considered off-limits. If they hadn't been, many others, say John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, wouldn't have survived. But Hart came along at just the wrong time, says Thomas Patterson, professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\n\nPatterson argues that Watergate, obviously the seminal political scandal of the '70s, had spawned a more aggressive type of political journalism, tasking reporters with exposing the lies of politicians \u2014 big or small.\n\n\"If Hart had been luckier, journalists would have been a decade behind where they were at this point,\" says Patterson. \"But Hart becomes the poster child, the first casualty, of an attack journalism that was really a product of Watergate, and journalists' sense that they couldn't trust politicians.\"\n\nEach team member behind \"The Front Runner,\" which will be in wide release on Nov. 21, has their own takeaway from the Hart story. For Carson, who worked on numerous political campaigns including for Hillary Clinton, it's how \"this world where I wanted to effect positive change ended up being so soul-crushingly awful.\"\n\nThen there's Jackman, who confesses he knew little-to-nothing about Hart beforehand: \"I was a traveling backpacker on a gap year!\" The Aussie actor traveled to Colorado to spend time with Hart, seeking to portray a multi-dimensional human being.\n\n\"Certainly my focus was on Gary and the man he was,\" Jackman says. \"But I'm left thinking about the question of principle and ethics.\" For Hart, but also for other characters in the film like campaign workers and journalists, \"there were lines not to be crossed,\" Jackman says, \"and it got simplified down to, 'Did he have an affair or not?'\"\n\n\"It wasn't that simple,\" Jackman adds. \"For Gary, it was the principle of, if he starts answering those questions, he's going to sully the process for other people, evermore. He felt like, 'If I start talking about boxers or briefs, or the name of my dog, it's over.'\"\n\nOf course, it was Bill Clinton who famously answered the boxers-or-briefs question. And for his own canny survival as a candidate, he may have Hart partly to thank, says Patterson at Harvard.\n\n\"Jump ahead four years, and Clinton had learned from Hart, from his failure and the damage it had done,\" he says.\n\nNow jump ahead to today. If we cared so much about Hart's affair with Rice, some have asked, why did we elect a president who'd bragged on tape about groping women? (Trump later called it locker room talk.) Did we stop caring?\n\nNo, though maybe we're more jaded, says Patterson. But we also live in a time of unprecedented political polarization: \"People increasingly filter this stuff through their partisan lens.\"\n\nOne thing everyone seems to agree on is that Hart would never survive a campaign in 2018 \u2014 mainly because he wouldn't run under such conditions.\n\n\"Not to exalt Gary Hart, but we're talking about a generation of potentially strong leaders who've had to find other ways to serve,\" says Bai. \"We've turned it into a performance process, where shamelessness and lying are rewarded.\"\n\nAdds director Reitman: \"Hart very clearly said these personal questions were irrelevant, and he walked away. My question isn't so much about him, but who ELSE isn't running? What other candidates are we not getting a chance at?"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Cesar Sayoc pleads not guilty in political pipe bombs case", "description": "Sayoc entered the plea through his lawyers during his appearance in Manhattan federal court.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/cesar-sayoc-pleads-guilty-political-pipe-bombs-case-59227632", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181115_wabc_mail_bomber_pleads_not_guilty_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:19:56Z", "content": "Now Playing: Cesar Sayoc pleads not guilty in political pipe bombs case Now Playing: School lockdown prompts 12-year-old to write goodbye letter to family Now Playing: Major fire devastation Now Playing: Arrests made in 'good Samaritan' GoFundMe campaign Now \u2026 [+1083 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Cesar Sayoc pleads not guilty in political pipe bombs case\n\nCesar say doc the man accused of mailing pipe bombs across the country to critics of president trump.

He had deployed to Afghanistan twice before his death in Bamako, Mali, in June 2017, Army officials said.\n\nThe charging documents don't state why the service members were in Mali. But U.S. Special Forces have been in Africa to support and train local troops in their fight against extremists.\n\nThe names of the service members who have been charged are redacted in the charging documents.

If you have questions about preparing turkey, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has put together some handy tips for preventing your celebration from becoming a food poisoning disaster. Here they are.\n\nHow far in advance can I buy a turkey?\n\nYou can buy a frozen turkey anytime, even a year in advance. A turkey will keep its top quality for a full year in the freezer.\n\nBut be sure to thaw the turkey properly before you\u2019re ready to cook it. Keep it in the fridge \u2014 one with a thermometer \u2014 at a safe temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit or slightly lower. Allow it to thaw one day for every five pounds of its weight, and then give it an extra day or two after that. So, if it\u2019s a 15-pound turkey, allow four to five days for it to thaw. After it\u2019s thawed, it\u2019s safe for another two days.\n\nIf you prefer a fresh turkey, be sure to buy it no more than two days before you plan to cook it.\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\nWhat are the most important steps before preparing the turkey and other dishes?\n\nHand washing and clean preparation and cooking spaces are two of the most important steps. A study from the USDA showed that people fail to properly clean their hands 97 percent of the time before and during meals.\n\nThe same study also found that more than 80 percent of people inadvertently contaminate other food they\u2019re serving. This usually happens when germs from the raw turkey aren\u2019t properly washed off a person\u2019s hands and are able to reach other surfaces, such as soap dispensers, cutting boards and spice containers.\n\nWhen you wash your hands, continuously scrub them with soap for at least 20 seconds, and remember to get between the fingers and under the nails. This will help you to avoid spreading bacteria that can increase the risk of foodborne illness.\n\nHow do I properly prepare the turkey for the oven?\n\nAfter washing your hands, it\u2019s time to prepare your turkey for cooking in the oven. Keep raw turkey separated from all other foods at all times and use separate cutting boards, plates, and utensils when handling the raw turkey.\n\nEven if your mother did it this way, do not wash the turkey, since the splashing can get bacteria onto the aforementioned kitchen surfaces and prep materials.\n\nOnce you\u2019re done prepping, place the turkey in the oven \u2014 recommendations from the USDA for safe cooking can be found here, but the main thing to remember is that bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses are completely killed by heat, so you should cook the turkey fully.\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\nHow do I know if my turkey is cooked properly before serving it?\n\nBuy a food thermometer if you don\u2019t already have one. Test the turkey in three spots to make sure the internal temperature is at least 165 degrees: the thickest part of the breast, the innermost part of the thigh and the innermost part of the wing.\n\nHow do I properly store the leftovers?\n\nPlace leftovers in the refrigerator within two hours of the meal; this will prevent bacteria from growing on the food. It\u2019s best to place the leftovers in shallow containers \u2014 this reduces the cooling time and therefore the amount of time that the food spends at unsafe temperatures (between 40 and 140 degrees).\n\nIf you stuff your turkey, always remove the stuffing and store it separately from the meat. Leftovers are good for three to four days in the refrigerator, so if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll eat them until the Tuesday after Thanksgiving or later, place them in the freezer.\n\nDr. Johanna Kreafle is an emergency medicine physician at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: US sanctions 17 Saudi officials for role in Khashoggi's killing", "description": "Saudi Arabia seeks death penalty for 5 suspects in journalist's killing, Palm Beach County misses FL machine recount deadline, Pelosi welcomes challengers in fight for House Speaker.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/us-sanctions-17-saudi-officials-role-khashoggis-killing-59226081", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/181115_vod_tbr_dwyer_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:01:37Z", "content": "Now Playing: Saudi official: Crown prince did not order Khashoggi killing Now Playing: Who is Nancy Pelosi?

Connor Finnegan here as well and it is snowing down here in Washington hope you're staying warm wherever you are take a live look now. At the capitol look at that we are in full on blizzard isn't wintry mix and we got wintry mix. And of course congress is in town today are hard at work underneath the dome there. Also trying to steal form. Today and digesting the news out of Saudi Arabia this morning the big headline involving the death of Washington Post journalist columnist. I jamarcus shall be who was murdered last month. It's hot in Turkey via Saudi officials the Saudi prosecutor to conduct an investigation this morning that Iran announced that it indicted eleven saudis. Recommended a death sentence for five of them in connection with the killing them jamarcus show he. Obviously it was a rendering gone wrong and he was drugged dismembered some pretty gruesome details they're Connor Finnegan you've been following this story. One thing that struck me was this official finding from Saudi said that and the yes. The crown prince who had known how. Of this whatsoever right does that hold water water US officials saying that some in the US officials do not agree with privately you know it's a government officials. May not go that far but we've heard a lot from Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. That clearly everything and the happens in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia must happen either with the consent or at least the oversight of the crown prince. A young guy but he's really consolidated power behind his father king some on. And it's clear that he handed out were not just jamarcus show you but many of his critics abroad. The comments so this operation. That that was underway it's hard to believe it didn't happen without him. And part of the problem for the saudis is that their story continues to change as you mentioned you know. Now finally revealing. Or admitting that you know he was dismembered that he. That there was an intention to kill him who right away when he entered the consulate in Istanbul that flies in the face of everything that they said before. So this is some trans. Currency terror the White House is so they want full transparency at least a payment service to that knowing that. Saudi Arabia is a pretty delicate ally the trump administrations tried to defend. Rain actions right now from that treasury we saw seventeen. People from Saudi Arabia issued sanctions and that you know they were their visas were revoked and believe it flowers and other major outlets in Asia and same issue is and he's earned me among them are the eleven people that were indicted for insider I guess you're basically sanctioning people who are going to jail. An eighteen in the Mercury in custody right there already I'm Karzai sanctions its own fact let's just put it up we've directly from Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. I'll hear your seen some of the highlights of the sanctions. Has just said fifteen man team that went into Istanbul. 22 Moorer. Jamarcus show he. It has been sanctioned importantly to you know the consul general and assembled a man who oversees that consulate. Is among those being sanctioned now as well and his senior advisor to crown prince Mohamed and summoned some it was very close to him and themselves could tiny. Who is really had a a fall from grace has been one of the the he and the real scapegoats in this entire episode was probably directed by the conference to carry this out and is now become one of the Foreman for tonight. It can actually sanction the crown prince which sent some see as the actions that the the real true punishment as Saudi Arabia on the operation yeah Salinas aren't our relationship between Saudi Arabia and diplomatically and Chris. On Capitol Hill of course are calling all of this out Rand Paul on close friend of the president Republican senator from Kentucky. Made this observation on Twitter just a little while ago he says United States is to project strength when dealing with Saudi Arabia putting sanctions as Connor was just saying. On people who are already in jail means nothing. These individuals might lose their heads you think they care we're doing were pretending to do something and we're doing nothing I guess that puts the question on the table what more. Can or will the trump administration do beyond sanction these people that are already behind bars. Yeah that's right you know how high are they willing to go the problem though is that the saudis have now laid out in case. Where the deputy intelligence chief. Is really the one they say is responsible for initiating this entire operation they've created this sort of chain of command and they're now holding all of those people responsible just 21 of them. In total that are in custody. And so far the US hasn't contrasted with that narrative that not an anything it's it's a target people outside of that chain of command and move beyond it. Whether or not they're willing to do that is is the big question now is terrorists that it could have. Really dire implications for the relationship with Saudi Arabia and the president has yet to win terra on. The latest developments today certainly but it given any hint of what further he might want to see done to Saudi with respect. Right you saw the prank the president really could not handle the pressure especially from the press the Washington Post day yesterday the headline. He actually call the Washington Post reporter to try to clarify that he was taking its death seriously. I'm but yet he did come out. Off the bat from the beginning saying we don't wanna cut arms sales with Saudi Arabia that's something that Rand Paul has called for I'm and so. At the end and friends as he doesn't want to lose millions of jobs the actual figures are. Quite minimal and you think about it by. He's clearly thinking a business interests before I diplomatic. Namely she much where coming this story think the next should drop will be up on Capitol Hill where the senate is still reacting digesting this news today and as terrorists alluding to. Potentially arm sales on the table. Some action were there before the end of the year. Up meanwhile speaking of the senate and those two contested. Senate races which Ers we're still waiting. The results for the results from from Tuesday's election. A week ago live though they're still in flux down in Florida what a mess down there let's bring in our political reporter Chris good who is. College it tracking all the developments in fact we have just recently passed the state mandated 3 o'clock Thursday deadline Chris for the recount to be finished the results to be certified. So were to think Stan. That's right and they didn't make it not all counties have completed their recounting by 3 PM deadline has is going on Florida. He had two races and governor's race that's separate its very close that separated the little bit more widely than a very very close senate race that's point 15 percentage points. Between sitting senator Bill Nelson a Democrat. Governor Rick Scott the Republican challenging and they've been recounting votes carries had until 3 PM today to finish and Palm Beach County key democratic county in South Florida. Did not make the deadline it had problems with their machines this week machines and overheated. Stopped functioning. And the S supervisor of elections and that counting descent. Not very long ago we didn't make it we tried our. Asked so what happens if they don't make it does that mean the original results from Tuesday's election. Stand as they originally worm and that particular race. Well here's the thing they're still counting votes there's recounting and then there's counting there's still an unknown number of overseas military ballots coming into Florida. People who live overseas people who are active duty military. Need to vote by mail because they're not in their home county. They have until Friday to have their ballots returned that's tomorrow so counties really will continue counting one way or another until Sunday. It's unlikely you'll get a result. And any official kind until Sunday. Meanwhile what's happening today. Regardless of whether all counties finish finish counting in the meantime where we're on our way to manual recount there is as close enough that. Now they'll have some ballots set aside. They counties will have to go through by hand. And I try to examine between now and Sunday. And that you're talking about is the senate race which is between Rick Scott the Republican Bill Nelson the incumbent Democrat that's very very close. On the but is your sense Chris that the governor's race. It's is pretty much going to be settled that won't go to a hand recount. The governor's race will likely not go to a hand recount there's state threshold the race has to be. Within point 25 percentage points the governor's race is currently outside that so you know mayor Andrew Young has said we need to count every vote. And as I mentioned there's an unknown number of votes yet to come in for military and overseas voters but it appears much less likely that that race we'll go to a manual recount. Current were inching towards a conclusion in Florida Chris thanks so much let's take a look. At where things stand in this in the battle for the senate just for those keeping score at home the big picture here we went into election night with 5147. Control for Republicans in the United States senate that there are two races undecided we've been talking about Florida the Bill Nelson. Rick Scott race but of course terror there is a pretty wild race playing out in Mississippi. You've kept some eyes on that they're surprisingly close as a runoff coming up and Mike. SB former Clinton official Democrat got one and again Cindy hunt Smith the Republican she she was back for prison trump. Right exactly and we knew this was coming this isn't a surprise that it's just a nut does more of the mid term is playing now and I think at the then it's an indication show though that the Republican Highsmith has it's only right now but. Very little Democrats and all the pulling us out of our hot and Natalie some things right exactly. So here we are something to track coming up just after Thanksgiving. Meanwhile on the house side. In the equation the battle has been heating up for who is gonna lead the house Democrats and their new majority we've been following it closely this week is Nancy Pelosi. Has defiantly asserted that she will be the next speaker of the house but. A growing number of Democrats and I knew her party saying not so fast her. Let's bring in our. House reporter Ben Siegel who joins us from Capitol Hill he's been tracking. That development and then were learning and getting word now that some Democrats are coming out of the woodwork to challenge her. I Nancy Pelosi potentially for speaker tell us what you're hearing. That's right DeVon one of the biggest developments appear. The last 24 hours is that Marcia fudge a Democrat from Ohio a former a leader of the Congressional Black Caucus. Has said that she's considering running against and Nancy Pelosi to challenge her to be speaker. In that race she's taking up the call that a this small but very determined band of Pelosi critics in the house have been calling for they want new leadership it's a mix of current members and if you. In coming Democrats some of the majority makers who ran on a call for new leadership. So she'll soon of those calls. She is not notably declared that you running for policy that some an apple and Nancy Pelosi her aides and her supporters of which there are many. In the house have pointed out that the fund is not quite in the race. But I look I think it's still a numbers game for Nancy Pelosi she's the favorite and it's her salutes. So will talk about the numbers in the second but here's what Nancy Pelosi had to say earlier today when asked about. This growing number Democrats opposing it was. I have overwhelming support. In my caucus to be speaker of the house and certainly we have many many people and that caucus. Who. And it could serve in this capacity I happen to think that at this point I'm the best person for that you are just it's. It's important to say to everybody come on in the waters from armed. Water is warm ban. Marcia fudge dipping her toe. Who else are you hearing out there who went it went what are people whispering about who else could be joining her. And in a national public challenge to Pelosi. What's interesting is that after Marshall fudged. Says she's considering this another name that you hear. Being thrown around is that Karen bass a Democrat from California a number of another member of the black caucus. She somebody has some of these anti policy folks have floated as a alternative she came out today on Twitter at to support Nancy Pelosi for speaker. So it's very much a scramble behind the scenes right now for Nancy Pelosi and her team to make sure that. They can the limit the number of of of critics and for the anti Pelosi folks to make sure they can stick together and large enough number system to deny her that the gavel. And of course Karen. Is a huge story April because Nancy Pelosi is a political icon right someone everybody in this country knows by the alike hater and but also because in years certainly a student in this town the speaker of the house is an incredibly powerful influential. Critical position in a governments in the line of succession. Brian president from certainly has made a big part of his. Mid term campaign to make. Nancy posted boogie man but then dirty little secret in the White House is that they rather work with a double lane knows in the double they don't know he. And that he would rather work with Nancy Pelosi then with an unknown fire. Interest and so Nancy Pelosi is the person or whoever is the next speaker of the Democrat democratic house. Determines of determines legislative agenda basically drives the train for Democrats. And will be sort of leading the charge and holy president she's going to make deals and that's how president county is Strathairn you'll see more and wanted out right now exactly. Also keep ours amount and I think Steven Seagal for his reporting up on Capitol Hill. Off finally today what's the president's thinking about terror he is currently. Is being mysterious I think is it is a good word this week he's. Limited his public appearances he's tweeting. Sort of at a higher rate than usual perhaps and today he's back to talking a lot. About Bob Mueller. Right which is suggested that there's going to be some sort of activity if there is going to be activity and that front it would likely happened this. Tomorrow once before in the at Thanksgiving. Holiday break usually these indictments come down at the end of the week. Friday. Late afternoon generation watching ABC news yeah. So when we've sort of picked up on it and then when the president comes back around I think something like six tweets today tweeted on Bob Mahler. The special counsel investigate he sees that the inner workings are simply nuts. Well he says he's in the process of answering the questions and he bit his questions were sent over to with lawyers he met with. His lawyer Rudy Giuliani dates acting on last night they talked about the questions that knoller asked hands and and you know. He's got clearly getting some information about what they're looking in gene based on those questioned what. Is what you you just spoke to Rudy Giuliani the president's lead attorney in this matter what is Rudy Giuliani saying about those questions about. What Bob Mueller wants to know from the president in right. While he hasn't really given away much about that in his it would give away what would be in the report essentially but I think you can take from the president's suite that he's not too happy about it. Mayor Giuliani told me that. You know the president is. So sat but not angry he wants to know when this is gonna wrap up piece he actually that he didn't like the way that manna for -- airport is former aide is being treated he was indicted. And so. You know. All we can do you really it is talked his attorneys and look to the tweets because the president has been a little cryptic about this but our sources say that. He's unhappy with the questions. In Friday's are always big days in this town both at the White House in the Muller investigation at the State Department so we. Are closely tracking developments tomorrow of course the White House also just announcing by the way guys that. President trump will travel to California. Rare trip to California to visit with victims from the wildfires there on Saturday that the first time. Traveled to California president not the first time he did to a fundraiser but certainly the first time to visit victims and another disaster old ones as well orders were an attack on Iran's. Can hurt he's been criticized for not going out there for numerous forest fires the shooting there at the borderline. As country western bar just a week or so ago. So we'll see what happens on Saturday. I meanwhile. Everybody in this town's bundled up we'll take a closing picture as we leave you today.

Have claimed victory but Democrats have said not so fast. And now the complicated process of a Florida recount begins you can see the pictures there.

Just said that is unlikely they'll be meeting their deadline they've had a number of issues there in Palm Beach coney. Apparently their machines are a little outdated they were overheating. As recently as yesterday they're also multiple reports out that this stuff they're the team actually took the night off last night possibly this morning to.

Early this morning there were actually able to complete. There machine recount now if the candidates are separated by just a quarter of 0% after this machine recount.

Bill Nelson right now these guys are separated by just point 14%. Roughly 121000 votes. This race has been incredibly contentious a flurry of lawsuits involved in this one.

Commission members then grilled Runcie on the district's communication with law enforcement and procedures for dealing with active shooters. Several commissioners pointed out that the district still hadn't created a policy since the Feb. 14 shooting for marking off \"hard corners,\" which are areas in a classroom that a shooter can't hit from outside the door.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n3:05 p.m.\n\nThe then-sheriff's deputy who was on campus during the Florida high school massacre but failed to confront the shooter didn't appear to answer an investigative panel's questions.\n\nFormer Broward deputy Scot Peterson declined to appear Thursday before the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission.

One victim's father said to DiRuzzo, \"He didn't do his job. My daughter should be alive.\"\n\nPeterson was assigned to the school and arrived outside the building where 17 died Feb. 14 shortly after the shooting began. He drew his handgun, but never went inside to confront the shooter even after other deputies and police officers did.\n\nCommissioners believe he may have been able to save six people who were killed on the building's third floor if he had intervened.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nThe suspected gunman in the Florida high school massacre tried to get a ride from the brother of one of the girls he had wounded.\n\nThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission heard Thursday that about 35 minutes after suspect Nikolas Cruz fled the school last Feb. 14, he entered a nearby McDonald's. He sat down next to a student he knew who'd fled the school where 17 died.\n\nPinellas County Sgt. John Suess told the panel Cruz and the student did not know the boy's sister was a victim. He said Cruz was \"pushy\" about getting a ride from the other student's mother, but did not get one. Cruz was arrested about 30 minutes later as he walked through a neighborhood.\n\nThe 20-year-old suspect has pleaded not guilty. His attorneys say he would plead guilty in return for a life sentence.

That put them in danger of accidentally firing on each other.\n\nThere was also confusion about whether the gunman was still inside the school because the video system in the office was unknowingly on a 15-minute delay.\n\nThe officers searching the building where the shootings happened were falsely told he was coming down from the third floor at their position on the second floor, when in fact he had fled the building.

Sitting right across from me be won the only Brian Tyree Henry how you downgrade. Greek and room up is because you know I have to say you aren't. Only one of the hardest working actors that I now. Elf seriously you have so much going on and and one of the the first thing that you guys know this is the Emmy nominated Brian Tyree Henry this the though one from land the one who was on Broadway and meet the money. I mean it was actually going to release as a program. Yet has yet but we we've got to jump into something that is coming very soon it's Friday. It is a film which I saw and I thought with absolutely amazed being. Called Whittle its by the one the only Steve McQueen who I had here not too long ago. Are you he chopped up and I'm jump to it because you play this kinda. Local crying mobile blood turn. Earned wanted to get into politics. Was guy I say yes and I just wanna make sure that people understand. That you know this this film is is gonna CAPTCHA you from. Like it it's it's quick it's quick paced and there's amazing lineup there's an amazing cast. And little bit about what attract you to this well let me isn't unclaimed backpack. Yes mean but I also have a view them as the bad guy you know I mean I think the you know villains. As the words again bad reputation. Because I don't thing villains were made their army born their army is made so I think with my -- did you mall. Is very clear presides lower -- -- -- when he speaks do because of the in the day. He's from a neighborhood meaningless would be you know moment neighborhood and was raised their born there earnings wants people come ago who are from there but it is today. If you think you're from and a February can emission targets combat. As living there are still want to win this race or Piazza's ways you know well my brother who play by the vehicle we you know the men are Brothers we have always getting things done you know old edition of some politicians and in our city of Chicago that we movie. Who do the same thing and get away with hitting and filled leg Jamal just wants his is fiercer. Began. I think you touch on something really important is that you know there there's definitely political themes in involved in this film and you know one of the the thoughts or rather the thing that kind of come up in the Aaron embryo in a touch on it is this idea which I think many people would agree like help. Since you. In the legalized crime business let me aren't really on the same level at the local crime crime guys. So was something that's something that you particularly he you know. Well you need to convey with senior character with that something that was told hey we really got -- is how did you approach. Jamal because Jamal are definitely different from his brother who pretty much like Bono he needs to got. Very well you know I think. What I love most about plains mall is at ease on the go and there is all alone you don't know anything else under the block some of that ward and arming. And I think what I wanted to do mostly with some extra day he represented. His areas represented the people there he as a politician that apology is positive rate you represent the voice of the people you Barney champion for them by any means necessary and I think that his word Jamal. Was seeking to do now at the end of the day. I think we know the divide in certain major cities you know you've got that invisible line that says you know the world he can live through the Portland fear you know when it comes associate economics -- race even affects some arms sort thing with Jamal. His rage comes from the fact he wants everything that they have to why is it possible for him to live in this ward over here have this mansion and have all these all these things. Away thinking the same thing so. I think don't most fun I had planned Jamal Willis and actually just be as easy as possible link to be the politician have their switching and I mean like death to be behind this podium Wednesday is giving the speech or make you feel great. But also from the street I don't forget that that was released here I'm in I think is all about respect honestly and I also really enjoyed. Focus on the Brothers like at the end of the day we love each other in the day there's not in this gonna get between us and we are gonna do. Everything we can make sure that we Como in this in this that he that we breweries and so. Are are really you know all I have a lot of Hartford Jamar our you know Arnold only UNICEF but bad form. It Erie where are really truly understood them are understood exactly. What he won in what he saw. Is when the nation that it was an act the way needed to be now. Read his sketch stuff. You examined using me you know. May not be cool you know you know bluntly I think that that's the fun of discovering characters like I mean because he you know while davis' character was assess the you know I mean life you know we're living in the penthouse over here. Which we think about me on here however you'll those missile from an article to open house and do what I want you know I mean. Now our worlds are colliding when you didn't even want him to even though because it's so I think that's Carson in the animals in his movies on a fun way to do in the world news. And that's that's so well said at an in the sense to. This is like a little snapshot a microcosm of well. Actually happened within our nation you know during this this divide in this class divide in obviously there's a racial divide and there are so many different levels was I think. You McQueen is able to encapsulate with in this film and we beyond it being something that you guys are gonna be enthralled and from the moment it starts the moment it adds. You know these characters are really developed and really strong and I think very purposeful in in the fact that. You have something that goes on in this city and that can essentially speak volumes to what goes on in our nation to them capacity when. I'm just curious you know II know he. With inspired by the greatest television show did anything about wit old prior to coming on his out Nomar was that it actually goes like this round. Incredibly though let my favorite thing arm our favorite. On a genre fellow with the heroines none I mean like the women who you know it's so easy to pull women in the place of being the big thumbs and you know following after Gary Neal love and things like that way you know when it comes out to the nit and grit every you know if you wanted to write to a few mountain on Amelio might pay adding in the today by any means registered women. Will enact a task that needs to be done because the society that release set up for them to beat you so for example and call widows you know I mean it's only here would know you immediately think a woman lost her husband what about a man losses what we don't really go wrong call on the window you know would O'Connor has the connotation that your weekend people need to PD England you know. And I think what I love about withstood it would dispose eat with their old definition in the home were on its fast you know I mean because these women come from. He's prepared regardless. Their husbands are gone and knowing what are your house was gone but they lied she's being lied to your face and in fits we'll put that thing or nobody actually gonna PD when all you've got to figure out how they get the balls do it yourself you know what I mean and I love that kind of message that is sending a bill giving into the day to be so easy feat. Women being pitted against each other but these are some of the strongest woman I've ever seen in I mean I think there and there's a true strength there women. Cary that is not mean known champion is much this should be because. I mean that that's from widow was just unbelievable of the week that it holds when it put on a woman you know I mean enacting what I love about this film is there. When you think you have them. Understood. You know you do have no cool off orbit logo and I love that liquor this is really incredible that all the performances in this movie emulate a ya. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- And I mean that's I'd eat you know even. I'm really went in to bid a minute detail. The completion of the word. You mentioned Kasten and of course you're super mart was. To check yourself who. Can. I think that it kind of segue into just how much stuff that you have going on with some touch on briefly because of the fact that I'm not a remembers after. I remember not. The common ground clearly are that I know when and so we've well let's start with the fact that I had them. Are wonderful political star year a little while ago and you know she obviously had wonderful thing that they about working with everybody including new engines. It's it's a family affair. And it's funny because of that you know clearly and watch Asia Allen and of the shelling initial in the meeting I think you're wonderful. It's funny because I went to college and I. Here I'm I've looked at mile high and are we yeah. Yeah. 100 as well so the whole idea is that to me it. I was curious about watching the show knowing that you went to morehouse and wears out what kind of EB gave because when you experience over the years it end in Atlanta and you you and you are an album with Atlanta for anybody who does miles land lots are actually laughed out you know on its. Admit lake I would rob David abernathy Alvin. Well mom memorial room when and then you know and in William. Album as we run where we were in the west and that we did. Edited. And being sat out dealt with easy to transform into paper boy because I'm thinking you haven't sold any paper boys led to believe that. I'm partly and Larry that is. That's that's the thing that I loved about it as though he's close it's always been thing. You know and a mean. You know 1000 more housing boom much regulating you know and morehouse. Was governor really hard time trying to figure all. How to maintain a sense of individuality. I mean our institutions are incredibly structured and incredibly. You know historic you know and I mean in there were some things like you know I was just come out it was them thrown in the millennium in those 2000 and I just remember. Not really knowing what I want it known right now relief knowing I mean you know as we you know and and and I applaud these schools like we need Perry's use things it's a big way and I think morehouse and storm for way they do better -- eight years or it was as we try to Figaro. Willow was you know an arm but don't one thing that I knew him. Oh very clearly concretely was while was in the studio where. And asked mark that's the thing there are love the most is Atlanta. Is ours rooms they analyze note this -- is ours like you look through you lose you're wearing Lugo. It's black as ours like we are the pillars of this community we build we is it like you could see people haven't shops and no businesses and amusing thing is Greg opposing as with the fastest. It's all doom is America. Rang. So for me. There wasn't anything that beckons government planner and then when our own effort begin in this group. And the title was just simply Atlanta nose like a bowl. O.s like that was bowl what what how will we say little wooden images remember opening the script is seeing Alfred I mean just an argument are that your own I could already cellular will cover Cologne was where I could tell you that. You know how much we have and is arguably there was a some busy reminding a lot of them by. You know and Lance Leggett and in the here's a thing is that he is dealing proportions the woman's border razors you don't mean. And you have to have respect for the natives especially the natives of because the today you know they're the ones that you know.

He buzz let's win and you you know I want them to be doom. But also want an end to be human you know one and I wanted and I want you to see all the parts of for that you meanness he behind. Closed doors you know cause tribe was have a thing you know you gotta be strong for him you've got to be the one you've got to be ready. You have to accept a lot of stuff. And timely you can do you got at any moment and there's a reason that you chose to do that you know and I mean but you know bullet route freeze I don't know late. Eight I just there was a lot of compassion and you know like I want to on the human reasoning and the humanity in him in you know look. My mom was one of them are silver over the Tuesday. It is I mean think O'Connell model now would have to some of my best friend's arm them and so the next problem that we had in the I'll never had an event. But I mean there's somebody's bow you know black men in black woman from the shelves soon to be said about the friendships in the community that we gear we have reached over in the trial not easy ways is not easy to survivors are easy to be urges -- he's recognized. Him when he wanted to be on anything has offered her record so. Even if it's him nothing in order so you know late charges are don't know lake. Hold a very close my heart army especially when the show was Cole and is the the plants. It's as though you know an island has become this thing where people can definitive. You know I mean people incumbent bill late you know. This whole thing of how it like it's completely shifting. And is well Michael there's a whole foods in the final point would you Eleanor elect Burton you know arm. At an edited into Thibault ownership you know because above claiming. A piece of wood this culture is in a piece of what you we deserve an owner many you know I mean enough for Lake Alfred is costly. You know search of Porter and runner for that I never warned him to get lost in there so as one of the foreign. No humanity it's all those offers we've known all those offers are we have yet to meet because their costs were being made as we speak when at the end of the day edges wanted to make sure that there was like a little hope of glory for him to make use in any way even if you still say that's why because they have classes will be amazing you know emulate. Because they'll be a make it has to be amazing you know only get you if he'd own a piece of something American there was that thing there are one of the most for a offered is truly you know ownership of his are going to be himself as friendships are scrambling that anything's possible or. No loom and is one initiative that Clinton. Eat eat you absolutely. Yeah I I thought I'd like I actually have. Really intellectual conversation about episodes of Atlantis so I'm going on yet another day another tumble ghetto better have clearly you know school I don't got a ghost soon before we do. I know after mean literally at summit on I caving in all of it today armed. That I hadn't come back and added that only other team in everything but there isn't yet so you know after this you know we're gonna see another film with UN it Neal street saw the film was at the premiere oh why you weren't and learning. Who supports although it it was magical and not. I don't affect a descriptive word but it was Manuel who maintain your character touches on something which I also think it's just as important everything that we're talking about with widows to. Is a fact of incarceration. And how it it seems to be one of these conversations that we keep having. You know people get black men and people of color block to a certain. Accusations were absolutely. A thousand press and current. And talked briefly about this film and and Witter witted to goal to get into that to that today at deep narrative because it's it's it's such a compelling film and you know I obviously don't talk about would've but just briefly touch and I. What's unfortunate an amount that is that as a black men in the classroom before we go with the prisoners like you mean like it's something that alerts over us. On the meaning that you are born you know they're is all about which you care as persons or person of color. Way so for Daniel. What out. What that let me let me just say this will level of Bo if eagle street that's Cox's. Very do some things so greet. Because of the into the did his movies but which you can have our fear and it's not anything tangible way it's about love. You don't mean leg just plain simple and true low disarm. You know in the end I think you know awakened a norm it it transcends com. I've never seen a betrayal of black public forum known mean land where you can just have to score in the back dislike Japanese people's ponies and arms it's okay. It's actually okay. And there's that moment in this movie where you lose. The feeling aware way to many you can be incarcerating and await your blacks we gig you've actually we've done in those moments where it's okay to to feed black love it for real. In his. Very different than a traditional looks Oreo you know immediately. I just couldn't government went something like that sword thing where Daniel comes in is that he's also reap a representational of the Rio. You know I mean like a you know this could be any of us and give him in his story as the Dartmouth has been told all the whipped an excellent thing that Daniel is that little drop and then in the movie reminders. That there's still anchored. Our ankles ways that we can never forgave him towards him and we have to release -- so. Did in the that they recognize that includes there's sort think that the annual.

Add California Wildfires as an interest to stay up to date on the latest California Wildfires news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nToby Lewsadder stepped outside an Ace Hardware store wearing a simple one-strap dust mask. He knew it wasn\u2019t the right defense against the wildfire smoke lingering in the air, but it was all he could find.\n\nThe local hardware stores he checked Tuesday didn\u2019t have the more substantial respirator mask that public health officials recommend to defend against the harmful wildfire smoke that is blanketing communities across the state. One pharmacy he contacted was selling surgical masks for only a quarter.\n\n\u201cNo one has them,\u201d said Lewsadder, 41, who was visiting the state capital from Los Angeles for an IT conference. So, for now, the dust mask would have to do: \u201cSomething is better than nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately, Lewsadder is wrong.\n\nAna B. Ibarra/California Healthline\n\nThe type of mask you wear matters very much if you don\u2019t want to inhale harmful pollutants, experts say.\n\nAnd as deadly fires burn in Northern and Southern California, destroying communities and lives, millions of people outside the burn zones are exposed to the dangerous smoke that\u2019s billowing into their communities and settling like dark shrouds.\n\nWildfire smoke is dangerous because it contains fine particulates that can lodge deep into the lungs, which can cause or worsen respiratory issues, such as asthma. Some groups are especially vulnerable, including children and older people.\n\nThe particulate matter floating across much of Northern California in the past week has registered more than 18 times the recommended levels by the World Health Organization. Such levels can trigger acute symptoms like difficulty breathing and headaches \u2014 even in otherwise healthy people.\n\nAna B. Ibarra/California Healthline\n\nHealth experts agree that the best defense is to stay indoors.\n\nBut many also suggest that if you must go outside for a prolonged period, it\u2019s best to wear the right kind of mask \u2014 especially if you have a health condition such as asthma, heart problems or emphysema.\n\nHealth professionals and firefighters are fitted for the right mask, but the general public is not.\n\nSo what kind of mask is the best?\n\nNot the dust mask that Lewsadder was wearing. Or the surgical masks that loop around your ears. Forget wearing a bandana or holding a tissue over your mouth \u2014 those won\u2019t protect your lungs.\n\nThe California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services and the California Department of Public Health recommend \u201cN95\u201d respirators or \u201cP100\u201d masks, both of which are approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for health care workers and firefighters.\n\nThose simple-but-sophisticated masks are intended to block at least 95 percent of the hazardous and tiny particulate matter \u2014 known as PM2.5 \u2014 that spews from wildfire smoke. At 2.5 microns or less in diameter, the particles of PM2.5 can\u2019t even be seen by the naked eye, said Dr. John Balmes, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of California-Berkeley. (For comparison, a human hair can measure as little as 16 microns in diameter.)\n\nOnce you find the right kind of mask, it\u2019s also important to wear it correctly.\n\nThe mask should have two straps. One strap should be placed below the ears and one above. And the mask should seal tightly to your face.\n\n\u201cThe efficiency of the mask is all about how well it fits the contours of your face,\u201d said Keith Bein, an associate professional researcher with the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California-Davis. \u201cIf there\u2019s a gap, air will come through the gap.\u201d\n\nBut if you have difficulty breathing or become dizzy, remove the mask.\n\nWhen a disposable mask gets dirty inside or you have trouble breathing, throw it out.\n\nTo the worry of some parents, the N95 masks aren\u2019t small enough for most children. Balmes, a medical doctor, said he tells his colleagues that they can put adult masks on their children, but he can\u2019t promise they will work.\n\nIn Sacramento, since the Camp Fire devastated the Sierra Nevada foothills town of Paradise about 90 miles north, the typically blue skies appear overcast. In reality, it\u2019s a smoky haze that has settled over the trees and buildings, leaving an acrid taste in people\u2019s mouths and irritating their eyes.\n\nAir-quality levels in the region have been in the \u201cunhealthy,\u201d \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d or \u201chazardous\u201d ranges for much of the week.\n\nArea residents have received mixed messages about whether to wear masks. Sacramento County\u2019s public health division issued a statement saying that only those people living near the fire should wear masks because they restrict airflow and can make it more difficult to breathe. Meanwhile, the city of Sacramento is distributing free masks to the public at fire stations.\n\n\u201cThere is confusion, and I think one of the problems is there is not enough evidence-based medicine on whether healthy individuals should be putting on these masks and when it\u2019s effective,\u201d said Mary Prunicki, a medical researcher and instructor at Stanford University\u2019s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy & Asthma Research. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re actually trying to investigate.\u201d\n\nDespite the mixed messages and poor air quality, many people in the state capital appear to be going about their business as usual. Leland Gilmore, 77, who was walking his dog, Ruff, in McKinley Park near downtown, didn\u2019t think the smoke \u201cwas bad enough\u201d to stay inside. Neither did the people shooting hoops, playing tennis and jogging at the same park.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned, yes, but I\u2019m not taking any special measures,\u201d said Gail Peoples, 61, on her late-morning walk with her two dogs. \u201cThis time of day seems OK.\u201d\n\nHowever, Peoples said she is worried about older family members, like her mother-in-law who has pulmonary issues and hasn\u2019t left the house for a week.\n\nPeoples knows there\u2019s a special mask but doesn\u2019t know what she should look for.\n\nWhen Sisco Martinez, who doesn\u2019t suffer from any asthma or respiratory issues, felt some chest pain, he visited a Sacramento fire station for a mask.\n\n\u201cI work indoors, but still, I wasn\u2019t feeling too well, so I thought I\u2019d better go get one,\u201d said Martinez, 19.\n\nExperts acknowledge that the masks don\u2019t block all the toxins in the air \u2014 the chemical gases, for example, released into the atmosphere when fire engulfs neighborhoods and the construction materials, cars, paint and other consumer goods that people use every day.\n\n\u201cThe masks are only removing particulate matter,\u201d Bein said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t remove the toxic gases.\u201d\n\nStill, Bein said, the proper masks are \u201cstill working better than nothing.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

He had stomach pain, which he assumed was a kidney stone. It was not. His CT scan showed an abnormal spot, later diagnosed as early pancreatic cancer. That chance discovery may have saved his life. Pancreatic cancer usually grows silently, without symptoms, and successful treatment is rare.\n\nThursday is World Pancreatic Cancer Day, in the hope that awareness about the disease can help save lives.\n\nWhat is Pancreatic Cancer?\n\nThe pancreas, an organ in the abdomen, is responsible for the secretion of digestive enzymes and hormones which regulate metabolism. Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. -- it may even surpass lung and colorectal by 2020. The lifetime risk of developing this cancer is 1 in 63 for men and 1 in 65 for women; the risk increases with age. Almost 90 percent of people diagnosed are over 55 years old. Other risk factors include a family history of cancer, obesity, smoking, diabetes, and a diet high in red and processed meats. A diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables may work to decrease risks.\n\nMatt Wilson\n\nWhy is it so deadly?\n\nMost people who are diagnosed, including Matt Wilson, only display vague symptoms at first: abdominal or upper back pain, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, a recent diabetes diagnosis, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Because these symptoms apply to lots of diseases, the cancer is often times diagnosed too late for meaningful treatment. There\u2019s a frightening 9 percent survival rate 5 years after diagnosis. This year alone 55,440 people will be diagnosed, and 44,330 will die.\n\nAre there different types?\n\nThere are two major types of pancreatic cancer: endocrine and exocrine tumors.\n\nThe most common and most aggressive form is the exocrine tumor. That is an adenocarcinoma that begins in the pancreatic ducts and gland cells, which produce enzymes. These cells have a thick coat to protect them from the digestive enzymes they produce. But that thick coat also reduces the effects of chemotherapy.\n\nJust a few cases of pancreatic cancer \u2013 about 1 percent -- are endocrine tumors. They affect the cells that produce insulin and glucagon, the hormones that manage our blood sugar. These cancers have a significantly increased survival rate 5 years after diagnosis of about 50 to 80 percent.\n\nTreatment options\n\nThe gold standard treatment option is a surgical procedure known as the Whipple. This technique was coined by Dr. Allen Whipple back in 1935 at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. Doctors remove many of the digestive organs: the gall bladder, common bile duct, part of the stomach, and the pancreatic head. Unfortunately, that procedure is only possible in about 20 percent of patients; it can\u2019t work with patients who are diagnosed with cancer in a later stage. Other treatment options include chemotherapy, a host of medicines designed to kill cancer cells. This may be done after the Whipple or along with radiation for those who aren\u2019t eligible for the surgery. Treatment is difficult because it\u2019s so hard to diagnose pancreatic cancer when the tumor is small. When it enlarges and obstructs pancreatic ducts or produces abnormal levels of hormones, it is often too late for surgery.\n\nPancreatic transplants, another treatment option, has also caught on recently. That\u2019s what Steve Jobs used, in part, to battle his disease. However, doctors warn that steps taken to stop the body from rejecting the new pancreas can allow remaining cancer cells to grow, and that means a high risk of the cancer coming back.\n\n\u201cAn oncologist will likely have to rely on both the science and the art of medicine to help a patient determine the treatment that is the best choice for them,\u201d Lynn Matrisian Ph.D., chief science officer for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, told ABC News.\n\nMatt Wilson\n\nCan\u2019t we screen for pancreatic cancer the way we do for breast cancer?\n\nThe International Cancer of Pancreas Screening Consortium recommends that people with hereditary pancreatitis, those with first-degree relatives who have been diagnosed, or those with BRCA1/2 mutations should be screened by doctors more closely when they come into the office with vague stomach pain. Unfortunately, no other specific guidelines exist.\n\nWhat is on the horizon?\n\nMatt, the ER patient, had surgery that removed part of his pancreas, spleen, and more than 20 lymph nodes. A challenging recovery and discovering a new cause means that Matt now splits his time as a university professor and advocate for others with the same diagnosis. He\u2019s now part of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.\n\nOrganizations like the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network are constantly working to urge further funding to find out what may work against this aggressive cancer. They\u2019re also researching biomarkers for a blood test that could help diagnose it early. At this point the tests remain unreliable, but perhaps further research can open new doors. Drug therapy targeting specific DNA mutations may help create drugs that better penetrate the tumor cells. But sadly, those screening tools will take years to develop.\n\nDr. Sumir Shah, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Queens/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "The Latest: Facebook to create independent appeals body", "description": "Facebook says it's setting up an independent body for people to appeal decisions to remove _ or leave up _ posts that may violate its rules.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/latest-facebook-create-independent-appeals-body-59225801", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:07:48Z", "content": "The Latest on Facebook 's content moderation practices (all times local): 3:50 p.m. Facebook says it's setting up an independent body for people to appeal decisions to remove or leave up posts that may violate its rules.

That has to be shocking to him. Do you think he'll start calling them fake news too or does he need someplace to go. I'm not surprised at all. I worked at fox for years. There's two opinions, the opinions and the news division. They've proved that they are not a mouthpiece for the white house. I'm talking about the new side. Bret Baier, Martha Maccallum, shep Smith. They are the best in the business and I think the message they were sending is we care about the first amendment. We care about democracy and we want to make that loud and clear and frankly if it's a Democrat in office the next time around you want to make sure you keep that consistent because that could happen to somebody else. Let's hope not. I think probably what would also -- not force them but, you know, move them to do it is because he also -- trump said after pulling Jim's pass, he said as far as I'm concerned I haven't made that decision, meaning pulling others. It could be others also. And I think people started thinking, oh my goodness, what if our Cecilia Vega gets pulled because ABC news is supporting Jim and CNN. He turned on her one day. And what if it happens to Peter Alexander and shep. What I found interesting in reading the briefs and reading about the arguments, remember the white house and Sarah Sanders in particular said Jim Acosta struck that young girl. Yeah. He assaulted her. Not true. Disseminating that doctored video. That argument was not made at all in court. They completely abandoned that argument and I thought that that said a lot. That said a lot. We've never seen press conferences like these, the ones that he has. Some people say when he attacks one of the reporters or when Sarah Sanders lies which she does for the president, that they should all walk out. I don't think that would work because they'll say, good, we don't have to be accountable to the press. But what I would suggest to them and it's probably not original but if one of them asks a question and they don't get the answer, the next one should ask, the next one, the next one. They're certainly more united together and I do wonder what this judge is going to do because the question really is, can the white house just summarily do something like this and really that's not the standard. No. Here's the problem because he's pissed, according to what he was arguing, because he's rude. He said Acosta's rude and is it freedom of the press when somebody starts screaming questions and won't sit down? Uh, look -- the bottom line is the press's job is to press you. Yeah. It's their job. That's what they're supposed to do. They're not always nice, and neither are you, okay? So let's put it in perspective. I never connected the word press before until you said that. But that's what they're supposed to. That's their job. Jim Acosta pressed everybody. That's his job. Yeah, that's what people forget about Jim. I mean, he was -- you know, he covered the war in Iraq from Baghdad. He also -- his father is a Cuban refugee and he actually went to Cuba on Cuban soil and pressed Raul Castro about the human rights violation. This is what he does and this is what every great reporter does. You speak truth to power and you ask those questions. And this president just doesn't like it. What he does not like is he does not like to be asked questions he doesn't want to answer, and quite honestly, we don't care as the American public whether you like answering. No president wants to be pressed. No. Obama has said he didn't like the white house -- You want it to be a smooth ride but that's not the real world. That's their job, and if you can't handle it, get out of the kitchen, man. He cannot handle it. He cannot handle any of the stress that he's going through right now. It's crazy. I think that trump needs to resign soon because I'm worried about his health. Get out. One thing I love about this country is the balance of power and thank goodness we have a balance of power but the role of the press and the role of the white house because you need both to survive and we need a healthy system that works. But I was going to mention Reagan because looking back there were a number of exchange between Ronald Reagan and the press and you know what he did? He had fun with it. He would make jokes and take it a different place. You've got to be savvy with them -- Bush did the same thing. You've got to learn how to work with them. You have to have a sense of humor to recognize that. Be self-deprecating. We'll be right back.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Michael Avenatti arrested on domestic abuse charge", "description": "The co-hosts discuss the latest on the domestic abuse allegations against Stormy Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/theview/video/michael-avenatti-arrested-domestic-abuse-charge-59222218", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/theview/181115_view_avenatti_1103_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:48:44Z", "content": "Now Playing: Michael Avenatti on Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen Now Playing: Michael Avenatti speaks out after domestic violence charges Now Playing: Michael Avenatti arrested on domestic abuse charge Now Playing: Northern California wildfire latest No\u2026 [+1091 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Michael Avenatti arrested on domestic abuse charge\n\nAnd one of the hottest topics this morning of course is the arrest of stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael avenatti on suspicion of domestic violence. Here's what he had to say after he was released on bail. Take a look. I have never struck a woman. I never will strike a woman. I have been an advocate for women's rights my entire career and I'm going to continue to be an advocate. I am not going to be intimidated from stopping what I am doing. So TMZ falsely reported that his estranged wife was the accuser but then she came out and said it wasn't her and that avenatti never abused her, and his other ex-wife said me either, you know. So when you first heard it, what was your response? So who did accuse him? We don't know. We don't know, but someone accused him. And stormy Daniels has put out a statement as well. She said we should all -- because that's who he represents of course. We should all respect judgment until investigation, an investigation Michael said he Wms is complete and that's what I'm going to do. Of course I too not condone violence and if these allegations are true, I will be seeking new representation. He comes on the show. It's very upsetting to hear, very disappointing. If it proves to be true, I will disavow him. I think he should take a polygraph test just to clear the air. I think that that would help him and then we'll see what happens. If this is true and we don't know much of anything. We don't know anything. But if this turns out to be true, I think he deserves to be raked through the coals because he's been this champion of the me too movement. I'll say the same thing that I said during the Kavanaugh investigation, I am a true believers in due process and hypocrisy drives me crazy in these moments. I think if you believe in due process with Kavanaugh, you should also believe in due process with Michael avenatti. With everybody. I was very disappointed as well when I heard about this because he is a friend to the show, but you have a police spokesman saying that the victim had visible injuries, and he was arrested. $50,000 bail, that means that the officers had probable cause to arrest. And so, you know, we don't know a lot. We don't know who the alleged victim is, but if true, I'm so disappointed, I'm so disappointed. And I agree with you, we would have to disavow him, and he is a friend to the show but you cannot abuse women. Yeah. You cannot do it. I'm not saying that he did but -- I'm not saying he did but, you know. I like the court. As you know, I've always been an advocate of take him to court. Take him to court and do the investigation, and if it proves to be true, then, you know, all bets are off. So we'll let you know when we know. When we know more. But it's, you know -- You know what, by the way, no one has mentioned this woman either because he is the topic of conversation. And who knows whatever happens here, whether it's true or not but if it is true what she's going through and the pain that she's feeling right now. I hope they don't mention her because victims of domestic violence are very traumatized by domestic violence and we don't need the media sort of putting an extra layer on it and staking out her home and doing that kind of thing so I hope that we don't know. I hope that it's an investigation, a confidential one is investigated and she isn't put through what we see, what we saw Dr. Ford go through. I hope we don't see something like that. I'm glad you mentioned the media because TMZ was the first -- I got the alert on my phone and they were the first to report Michael Jackson's death and the first to report -- And they got this one wrong. They got this one wrong and they corrected themselves but I think the media, to your point, sunny, is part of the problem because they're in such a problem to publish the story that they don't wait to get the facts. It's also the social media. Again, remember what Dr. Ford went through and continues to go through because she had the courage to stand up. I hope this woman -- We'll keep an eye on it. We'll keep an eye on it because, you know -- We're watching. Yeah. The world is watching. The world is watching.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Chris Good", "title": "Palm Beach County misses Florida recount deadline", "description": "One key county in Florida missed Thursday\u2019s 3 p.m. deadline for recounting votes in the state\u2019s hotly contested Senate, governor\u2019s and agriculture-commissioner races.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/palm-beach-county-misses-florida-recount-deadline/story?id=59224752", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/scott-nelson-ap-er-180828_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:48:01Z", "content": "Palm Beach County a politically pivotal area in Florida missed Thursdays 3 p.m. deadline for recounting votes in the states hotly contested Senate, governors and agriculture-commissioner races.

Rick Scott and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson \u2013 and the governor's contest, between Mayor Andrew Gillum and Rep. Ron DeSantis.\n\nThe Senate race and agriculture commissioner races will move to manual recounts.\n\nA manual recount is solely a hand recount of overvotes and undervotes in the affected races. An overvote is when a voter designated more choices than allowable in the recounted race and an undervote is when a voter made no choice or less than the allowable number of choices in the recounted race.\n\nThe results of the manual recount will be reflected in the official returns due to the Department of State no later than noon on Sunday.\n\nThe governor's race is less likely to meet the threshold for a manual recount.\n\nIn the Senate race, Scott leads Nelson by .15 percentage points, according to current totals.\n\nIn the governor's race, DeSantis leads Gillum by .41 percentage points. Gillum has urged Florida to count every vote.\n\nAn unknown number of overseas and military ballots are still coming in \u2013 they can arrive until Friday, under state law. Counties will have until Sunday to count them, and official results are not expected to be known in either race until after that happens.\n\nLatest in Court\n\nA federal judge on Thursday denied Nelson's request to extend recount deadlines. But Nelson did score a win, in his bid to allow provisional and by-mail ballots where signatures did not match those on voter-registration books, as required by state law.\n\nA federal judge gave voters whose ballots had been rejected until Saturday to correct the issue with election officials. The ruling will affect an unknown number of ballots. Just under 4,000 ballots are known to have been rejected, but that total does not encompass all counties and lacks totals from some key ones, like Duval and Miami-Dade.\n\nNelson is also challenging Florida's laws over what ballots count, seeking to expand considerations of when a voter intended to select a specific candidate with a ballot mark.\n\nABC News' Adam Kelsey, John Verhovek, Stephanie Wash, and Karen D\u2019Uva contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Navy SEALs and Marines charged with murdering Green Beret in horrific hazing incident: Prosecutors - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Navy SEALs and Marines charged with murdering Green Beret in horrific hazing incident: Prosecutors ABC News Two SEALs from the Navy's elite Seal Team Six and two Marines have been charged with murder and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Army \u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/members-seal-team-marines-charged-green-berets-murder/story?id%3D59218757", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:33:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Tom Berman and Allie Yang", "title": "26-year-old's incredible face transplant journey: 'I see me'", "description": "Cam Underwood, the son of a California pastor, underwent the complicated surgery.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/26-year-man-shares-incredible-face-transplant-journey/story?id=59200940", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_camreunion_le_181115_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:32:29Z", "content": "Cameron Underwood was 24 years old when the course of his life changed forever, resulting in his undergoing a state-of-the-art face transplant procedure.

Through this extensive surgery, Underwood's face is now connected to the face of another young adult who was able to give him a second chance at life.\n\nUnderwood, the son of a California pastor, told ABC News\u2019 Amy Robach in an interview for \"20/20\" that he still has the face he was born with from the cheekbones up, but almost everything below that belongs to the donor -- a 23-year-old aspiring New York filmmaker and writer named Will Fisher.\n\nBut when he looks at himself now, \"I see me,\" he said.\n\nUnderwood grew up in a close-knit family, grounded in its faith. His grandfather founded the United Pentecostal Church in the Northern California agricultural community of Yuba City.\n\n\"Faith is the essence of everything in our family,\" Underwood's older sister Julie Jones said. \"Without that foundation, I think this journey would've been a lot more difficult.\"\n\nThe Underwood Family\n\nUnderwood\u2019s mother, Bev Bailey-Potter said her greatest joy is her children \u2013 Julie, Aaron, Brad and her youngest, Cam.\n\n\"They were just so close and I always took pride in that.\" Bailey-Potter said, and Cam \"was just easy. He was always quiet, a little on the shy side... but just a wonderful spirit about him... easy going.\"\n\nShe said he was \"just a handsome boy,\" and \"His smile would light up his face and it was so evident in his eyes.\"\n\nThe Underwood Family\n\nUnderwood had just started his career working in his stepfather\u2019s business of heavy equipment repair. With that money, he was able to buy his own house at the age of 19. Hunting was also a family pastime.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really an outdoors family,\u201d his father Randy Underwood said. \u201cHe [Cam] grew up on the lake\u2026 He was just a natural athlete, he was good, he enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nEven with everything going for him, his mom said the bright light that always shone in his eyes began to fade.\n\n\"You know, I have a clear memory in my mind,\" Bailey-Potter said. \"I saw him walk across the parking lot... and he just looked so sad and empty. I just thought... what is he going through? Is he unhappy?\"\n\nThe family says Underwood became a workaholic and was pushing himself too hard. He began struggling with depression, they said, but kept this to himself, rarely expressing his emotions. After Underwood went through a breakup, his brother Aaron Underwood remembered, \"He started going out more... and you know, partying a little more at that time.\"\n\nThe Underwood Family\n\nOver the next few years, Underwood\u2019s family said he and his closest friend and brothers drifted apart \u2013 the friend started a family and his older brothers started new jobs and moved out-of-state. His struggle with alcohol was apparent, but less obvious to his family, they said, was Underwood\u2019s underlying depression. It was a shock to them when Underwood not-so-subtly hinted one day that he was thinking of taking his own life.\n\n\"I thought well, you know, he\u2019s just going through a rough time... we all do,\" his mother said.\n\nHis family decided to remove all of the guns in his home. But there was one they couldn\u2019t get to: Underwood had put a shotgun in his safe.\n\nOn a Sunday night in June 2016, Underwood\u2019s uncle Lonnie said he received a text from his nephew asking him to come over and stay the night.\n\n\"I got to his house and all the lights were on, which I expected,\" Lonnie said. \"Door was unlocked, I walked in... nobody in the living room.\"\n\nLonnie walked into the bedroom and into a nightmare. He saw blood everywhere, and Underwood staggering against the wall.\n\n\"I think that is probably the point where I went into shock,\" Lonnie said.\n\nUnderwood had placed the shotgun under his chin and fired, in an attempt to take his own life. He was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital.\n\nAt the hospital, \"They told us he had \u2026 no teeth, no chin, no cheekbones, no facial structure\u2026 nothing,\" Randy Underwood said.\n\n\"It really wasn\u2019t a face... it was pretty horrific,\" Aaron Underwood added.\n\nUnderwood was transferred to University of California-Davis Medical Center, where renowned plastic surgeon Dr Lee L.Q. Pu implanted 12 titanium plates to keep what was left of his shattered skull intact.\n\nUnderwood survived the ordeal but underwent eight surgeries to restore the bare minimum function to his face. To cover his face, doctors used skin from his thigh and tissue from his shoulder. His nose was lost in the blast and he only had a tiny hole to breathe through. Even then, the results from his surgeries were difficult to endure.\n\n\"What kind of quality of life would he have?\" Bailey-Potter wondered. \"If he didn\u2019t want to live with all that he had going for him, then why would he want to continue on now?\"\n\n\"I cried every day for a year... every single day,\" she continued.\n\nRandy Underwood said, \"I would\u2019ve changed places with him any day. I would\u2019ve taken his pain any day, but I couldn\u2019t.\"\n\nIt was six months before Underwood could leave the hospital \u2013 even then, he wore a mask wherever he went.\n\n\"I would see people stare at him and he would notice that,\" Randy Underwood said. \"The worst part was the little kids... stare at him and hang onto mom and dad because he looked so pitiful.\"\n\nBut then Dr. Pu suggested that a face transplant might be possible and could give him a chance at a better life.\n\nCoincidentally, Bailey-Potter found herself at the checkout counter of her local grocery, thumbing through a magazine that highlighted the story of firefighter Patrick Hardison.\n\nHardison was a fireman in Mississippi who was horribly burned trying to rescue a woman from her burning home. His face was so badly burned that his fellow firemen didn\u2019t know it was him at first when they got to him.\n\nHardison survived -- but his scalp, ears, nose, eyelids and lips were gone.\n\nHardison underwent multiple surgeries to try to repair his face. He suffered years in isolation, hiding himself as much as possible from the outside world. Then he met Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, a renown reconstructive surgeon who is the chair of NYU Langone Health's Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery in New York.\n\nIn 2015, Dr. Rodriguez agreed to perform what was at the time the most extensive face transplant ever done.\n\nThe operation took 26 hours and replaced Hardison\u2019s entire face and scalp with skin, tissue and nerves of a donor. Since his surgery, Hardison, whose story was also profiled by ABC News' \u201cNightline,\u201d has had a better quality of life.\n\nSo Underwood\u2019s mother thought Dr. Rodriguez might be able to help her son as well.\n\n\"I decided I that I would go ahead and on my own, you know... send an email to Dr. Rodriguez,\" Bailey-Potter said.\n\n\"Cam\u2019s mom sent me an email. Her story was very moving,\" Rodriguez said. \"Looking at him with that injury, right away, I knew there was no way this kid, I could ever make him normal with conventional surgery.\"\n\nBecause Underwood\u2019s brain wasn\u2019t affected in the blast, Dr. Rodriguez\u2019s thought he could be a potential candidate to be his third face transplant patient.\n\nEach face transplant surgery is incredibly complicated and has its own particular, unique challenges in every case. The procedure costs over $1 million and though that\u2019s usually paid for by a grant, Rodriguez said \"everybody was worried\" about the possibility that Underwood could try to end his life again after the transplant.\n\nSo, Rodriguez went up to Yuba City, California, to meet Underwood and his family in person and discuss the risks and concerns, including Underwood\u2019s struggle with depression and his attempted suicide.\n\nBut according to Rodriguez, \u201cI think these individuals all deserve a second chance \u2026 we shouldn\u2019t give up on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knew it was a test per se,\u201d Aaron Underwood said. \u201cI think we did understand that\u2026 he had to be sure that their investment in Cameron was secure, that he was not the kind of patient that would take this amazing miraculous gift and throw it away.\u201d\n\nRodriguez said this was something that they only offer to select individuals.\n\n\"And we have to be sure we have chosen the right person,\u201d he continued. \u201cI need to know that I have a fighter on my hands... and this person\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes to have this operation be successful.\"\n\n\"We want to hear that we\u2019re going to get this fixed and we\u2019re moving on with our life, but it\u2019s not that simple,\u201d Rodriguez added \u201cThere could be serious complications from something like this. It\u2019s very important that people understand the severity of undergoing this operation.\"\n\nFor starters, a face transplant means a lifetime of treatments with harsh side effects to prevent rejection \u2013 and doctors say they just don\u2019t know enough yet to predict survival beyond 10 years.\n\nBailey-Potter said, \"it did\" give her pause, \"but it was Cam\u2019s decision to make.\"\n\n\"That was hard to swallow... but I would rather have 10 years of great life than 100 years of miserable life,\" Aaron Underwood said.\n\nBy the end of the visit, both doctor and patient were on board.\n\n\u201cBeing accepted into this program is very much like winning the lottery,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut instead of $500 million\u2026 Cameron wins a second chance at life.\u201d\n\nBut \"the most difficult part,\" Rodriguez said, was still ahead \u2013 the search for a perfect donor: \"It\u2019s like a needle in a haystack.\"\n\nIt was about seven months after Rodriguez accepted Underwood as a patient that a donor became available. It was a young man who had registered with New York state to be an organ donor, as well as signed up with the non-profit organ and tissue donation service, LiveOnNY.\n\nBut Dr. Rodriguez, who rushed from NYU Langone to another hospital in New York where the donor was, said the request for a face donation is a very special one \u2013 handled with the utmost sensitivity: \"That\u2019s asked at a separate time... a separate consent.\" After speaking with the donor\u2019s mother, she consented to the request.\n\nMiraculously, the donor had all the prerequisites to be a match for Underwood \u2013 skin tone, hair color, skull size plus a matching blood type. Rodriguez said the match felt \"absolutely\" fated to be.\n\nA team of more than 100 medical staff worked in side-by-side operating rooms at NYU Langone to complete the transplant.\n\nDoctors removed the lower portion of the donor\u2019s face, preserving the muscles, tissues and blood vessels -- eventually taking his teeth, along with the bones that make up his cheeks, nose, chin and jaw.\n\nThe damaged portions of Underwood\u2019s face were also surgically removed. This preparation alone took more than 12 hours \u2013 the actual facial reconstruction would take just as long.\n\n\"Often people think it\u2019s just like putting on a mask... it\u2019s not that simple,\" Rodriguez said. \"The face needs to fit like a puzzle -- and that\u2019s a tricky thing because we hit the point of no return.\"\n\nRodriguez started the actual transplantation by aligning the bones perfectly. Once they were connected, he moved on to the painstaking work of attaching muscles, nerves and blood vessels.\n\n\"We prayed for those doctors through the night,\" Bailey-Potter said. \"They were pulling an all-nighter. None of them were leaving.\"\n\n\"I had prayed for that miracle every day for a year.... and my son had a nose, he had a mouth, he had teeth,\" Bailey-Potter said. \"It was just a happy moment.\"\n\nUnderwood reflected on the first time he saw himself after the transplant: \"Wow... that was breathtaking. And I was just blown away, relieved... and excited all at the same time.\"\n\nABC News\n\nTen months later, he can breathe through his new mouth and nose \u2013 and smile.\n\n\"I can smile, I\u2019m working on closing my lips all the way, they don\u2019t close all the way... but they\u2019re getting there,\" Underwood said. \"They\u2019re a lot better than they were.\"\n\nPart of the recovery has been extensive dental work \u2013 and he says one of the biggest things he missed was \"being able to actually eat.\"\n\n\"Just to let it sit in your mouth and taste it,\" he said. \"All those little things that we take for granted that you know, you miss and you want back.\"\n\nABC News\n\nUnderwood, now 26, said over the last year it\u2019s been a lot of work to teach himself \"how to talk again with a new mouth and new teeth and lips\": \"It\u2019s just like a baby learning to talk.\"\n\n\"I have a strong son, and I\u2019m grateful for that,\" Randy Underwood said. \"He\u2019s got a lot of tenacity, and he\u2019s got a lot of determination... he\u2019s going to come out of this.\"\n\nMonths after Underwood\u2019s surgery, Dr. Rodriguez arranged for Underwood to meet his donor\u2019s mother for the first time. \u201c20/20\u201d was there and captured the emotional meeting.\n\nABC News\n\nBack home, Underwood has been able to get other pieces of his old life back \u2013 playing golf, even skydiving. Though as great as getting back into his life is, he admits there are still tough days.\n\n\"Occasionally, it\u2019s not a daily fight anymore... but yeah, there are still days when I am depressed,\" Underwood said.\n\nHis mother said they wanted to share his story to \u201cgive someone else hope\u201d and show that \u201cThis ailment of depression it\u2019s treatable.\u201d\n\nBut he says he knows to ask for help now when he needs it \u2013 whether that means at church or at home.\n\n\u201cI just want people to know that it can happen, you know? That if you\u2019re in the same kind of situation that I was in\u2026 there\u2019s people out there that can help you and will. You just have to reach out,\u201d Cam Underwood said.\n\nHe added that he was \"very grateful\" to have a full life ahead of him. His goal from here, he said, is \"that I can get back to work... and you know, eventually I want a family and kids... you know, the American dream.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Statue of Liberty's original torch moved to museum site", "description": "The Statue of Liberty's original torch has been moved from the base of the statue to its new home in a museum that will open next year", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/statue-libertys-original-torch-moved-museum-site-59224023", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/WireAP_bc47f323e36d4573affb75ca0bfc3306_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:30:30Z", "content": "The Statue of Liberty's original torch has been moved from the base of the statue to its new home in a museum that will open next year.

So that song was \"Drown in my own tears\" by don Shirley, the musician you play in the new film \"Green book\" and it's inspired by a trip that he took. Tell us -- tell everybody about it. Don Shirley was also a fan of yours and attended several of your shows by the way. Yeah. But um, yeah. Tony, an Italian man from the bronx, and don Shirley, an published concert pianist, start here in New York and go on a tour through the south. My character speaks 8 languages, refined, amazing man, complicated and dynamic. Tony, played by viggo Mortensen is a bit of a brute, tough guy, bouncer, a boxer and he needs to hire him to sort of be a bodyguard for him going through the south. And Tony is racist. And so it's the evolution of both the characters is really beautiful and dynamic and revealing about humanity. They end up still being very different by the end of the film but understanding so much more about each other because they share intimate space and they talk and their guard begins to drop and they really connect and you see the humanity in each of those characters. There's a kind of a lesson in there for today, isn't there? No doubt, no doubt. I saw you guys going back and forth about, you know, soul music and country music and everything. I think that's the nature of -- this is actually a great space because you can have these wonderful conversations. With respect. With respect, with people who come from different communities, different cultures, different opinions. We got to have those things. Were you surprised when you discovered what a green book was? Yeah, I was. So do y'all know what a green book was? You tell them. A green book was originally put together by a man who worked in the post office, an African-American man by the name of Victor Hugo green, and he basically had a list of -- because it was word of mouth at this point. Right. I know there's a place you can stay in Louisiana near such and such. You're traveling and you're black. If you're traveling while black, this is a list of places you can stay to get from California to funeral you got to get to in Beaumont, Texas. My grandmother told me about it because she grew up in Macon, Georgia. She told me it could be the difference between life and death. It's sad that we needed something like that, isn't it? Yeah, it is, it is. Well we did, but I mean, the realities were we weren't welcome everywhere when you have white-only drinking fountains. You know that you need to figure out if you want to travel, you need to know where you can go, what beaches you can go to, what bathrooms. Restaurants. It was the nature of the country. Thank god somebody thought about it because things could have been a lot worse without it. Yes. You and your co-star, viggo, are terrific in this film. This is just a beautiful film and it's nuanced and it really is applicable to what we're talking about almost every day on this show. You two have a lot of funny moments in the film but during a q&a for the film last week viggo was talking about how the \"N\" word was used more casually back in the '60s and he actually said the word. Yes. Yes. And there was backlash. And he's apologized, but what does that do in terms of the -- what's the impact on the conversation? You know, in the moment it was -- any time a debate can be had in black culture about the appropriateness of the word that should be left in black culture to have that debate, black community. But any time a nonblack person says it in a space, there's a mini explosion that goes off within you because you suddenly haven't processed the intention behind it, the relationship behind it. In this case and with viggo who I absolutely love and adore, there's a difference between racism, insensitivity and a lack of awareness. Any time someone, black, white, Asian, Latino, whoever exhibits a moment of a lack of awareness about something and then they quickly apologize and get it, part of us moving on and healing as a country and as a people is embracing that apology, not having no probationary period about it, like really embracing that apology and being like, all right, brother, you could actually be closer as a result of that because then they understand something on a deeper level. If he had never said it, maybe he would have never had that deeper understanding of how it could in some ways disrupt things. So, I just want to understand, he was talking within -- talking about the film, right? Let me actually tell you what happened. And the reason I know the context of what he was saying was because we've been doing this for a long time, for a month. And he and I both have said if you remove -- and this is exactly what he was trying to get at. If you remove the \"N\" word from why are vocabulary, it doesn't mean that you're not harboring racist thoughts or supporting policies that are racist or discriminatory, and so in expressing that, he's saying that it doesn't disqualify you from being a racist, and he said the full word in saying it. So you mean now we can't say the word? Because I am -- if you are going to explain this period of time, you've got to tell people what you're talking about. I don't think he was calling anybody out. No, no, he wasn't. He was talking about the time and the word. So I -- There was tremendous backlash. I understand and I think we have to be really careful what we're backlashing about. Right. Oh sugar. Yeah, we got to go. Got to go. The movie is great. It's great. The movie is brilliant. Listen, you have to -- is this the first time you've come on? Yeah. You have too come back. I would love to. Look, you have to come back because not only are you a fine actor, just a good person. Thank you. \"Green book\" is in theaters tomorrow. It opens wide November 21st.

She's won three Emmys (two in the same year for \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,\" and one for \"The Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All\"), a Tony award (for \"The Trip to Bountiful\"), been a Kennedy Center honoree and, in 2016 was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama. Now she can add one more award to that list as she prepares to accept her honorary Oscar Sunday at the 10th annual Governors Awards Sunday in Hollywood.\n\n\"I come from lowly status. I grew up in an area that was called the slums at the time,\" Tyson said. \"I still cannot imagine that I have met with presidents, kings, queens. How did I get here? I marvel at it.\"\n\nWhen film academy President John Bailey called her to inform her that the Board of Governors voted unanimously to give her the award, she \"went to water.\"\n\n\"It is the last thing in the world that I ever expected,\" Tyson said, thinking, \"I hadn't done a major movie since 'The Help.'\"\n\nTyson has worked since the 2011 film, with roles in \"Last Flag Flying\" and the television show \"How to Get Away With Murder,\" but \"The Help\" was the last film that had anyone mentioning her name alongside Oscar. Oprah even called her and predicted she'd get a nomination, to which she responded: \"My role was two seconds!\"\n\n\"I am extremely grateful to the Board that they even know my name,\" Tyson added with a hearty laugh.\n\nShe is being honored Sunday along with publicist Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin.\n\nBorn in Harlem, Tyson started out as a model and theater actress, eventually landing a role in the film \"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\" in 1968. Her pursuit of acting caused a rift with her mother, who disapproved, but Tyson said she was her \"motivating force.\"\n\n\"I was determined to prove her wrong,\" Tyson said.\n\nPlus, she learned quickly that she had a larger purpose than just acting. On the press tour for \"Sounder,\" which took her to parts of the United States that she hadn't yet been to, she remembers a man in a press conference telling her that watching the film made him realize that he was prejudiced.\n\n\"He said, 'You know, I could not accept the fact that your older son was referring to his father as daddy. That's what my son calls me,'\" Tyson said. \"And I thought to myself, 'My God. My God.' It was those kinds of experiences as I went across the country promoting 'Souder' that made me realize that I, Cicely Tyson, could not afford the luxury of being an actress. There were some issues that I definitely had to address and I chose my profession as my platform.\"\n\nIt led to a lifetime of activism and humanitarianism off screen. Tyson even has a performing arts school named after her in New Jersey and frequently goes on tour to speak to children. On screen Tyson has portrayed women like Coretta Scott King and Harriet Ross Tubman. She decided early that she would only take jobs that \"speak to something,\" which is also why she ends up saying \"no\" a lot.\n\n\"My honorary Oscar proves to me that I was on the right track and I stayed on it,\" Tyson said.\n\nAnd while most of the time \"no\" works, sometimes it doesn't. Tyson tried to say no to wearing a terrifically large hat to Aretha Franklin's funeral only to be overruled by her designer. The hat would become a viral highlight.\n\n\"I never thought in my career that I would be upstaged by a hat! And I did not want to wear it,\" Tyson said. \"I said, 'I can't wear that hat, I will be blocking the view of the people behind me, they won't be able to see and they'll call me all kinds of names.' He just looked at me and said, 'Put the hat on.'\"\n\nShe came around, eventually, thinking of the hat as homage to Franklin's appearance at Obama's inauguration.\n\nAs for whether or not she'll don a similarly spectacular piece of art on her head Sunday night at the Governors Awards? Tyson just laughs.\n\n\"Oh no!\" she said. \"I won't even mention it to him.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Thousands demand resignation of Czech PM over fraud scandal", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Add Interest\n\nThe accusations were detailed in a year-long investigative report, \"Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook\u2019s Leaders Fought Through Crisis\" published by the New York Times on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the more damaging aspects of the Times report was that Facebook hired a Republican-linked D.C. consulting firm to plant negative stories about Facebook's competitors and critics. The move seemingly contradicts the company's public claims that it is transparent about how it handles fake stories on the platform.\n\nSince the 2016 elections, Facebook has launched several \"transparency\" initiatives over the past year.\n\nAnnouncing a campaign targeting accountability for ads in June, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said, \"we are providing much more transparency than any other advertising platform, either online or offline.\"\n\nJosh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nFacebook fired the D.C. consulting firm, Definers Public Affairs, on Wednesday. Zuckerberg, in a conference call with reporters Thursday, repeatedly claimed he did not know that the company had been hired, trying to distinguish Facebook's culture with repeated references to \"Washington, D.C., firms.\"\n\n\"I learned about this relationship when I read The New York Times piece yesterday. I looked into whether this was the kind of firm we should be working with. And we\u2019re not working with them,\" Zuckerberg told reporters. \"This type of firm might be normal in Washington but it\u2019s not the kind of firm I want Facebook to be working with.\"\n\nZuckerberg also defended his key lieutenant, Sandberg.\n\nAntoine Antoniol/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"I want to be clear, I mentioned a couple of times I was not in the loop on some of these decisions, and Sheryl was also not involved and she learned about this the same time as I did,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Overall Sheryl is doing great work for this company, she\u2019s been a great partner to me and will continue to be a great partner to me.\u201d\n\nSandberg commented on Facebook late Thursday, saying she \"wanted to address some of the claims that have been made in the last 24 hours.\"\n\n\"On a number of issues -- including spotting and understanding the Russian interference we saw in the 2016 election -- Mark and I have said many times we were too slow. But to suggest that we weren\u2019t interested in knowing the truth, or we wanted to hide what we knew, or that we tried to prevent investigations, is simply untrue,\" she wrote. \"The allegations saying I personally stood in the way are also just plain wrong. This was an investigation of a foreign actor trying to interfere in our election. Nothing could be more important to me or to Facebook.\"\n\n'There are lot of things I\u2019d do differently'\n\nThe company has repeatedly admitted it had not done enough to prevent the spread of fake news and political manipulation on its site, which executives repeated on Thursday through multiple press statements and on a call with reporters.\n\n\"But to suggest we weren't interested in knowing the truth, or that we wanted to hide what we knew is simply untrue,\" Zuckerberg said at the beginning of the call, which was originally meant to tout the company's progress cracking down on fake accounts, hate speech, terrorist propaganda, bullying and child pornography.\n\nFor example, Facebook removed over 1.6 billion fake accounts between April and September of this year, the company reported on Thursday.\n\nFacebooks Community Standards Enforcement\n\nInstead, the call turned into a crisis management session in which Zuckerberg and other executives defended their decisions amid a barrage of media questions related to the claims in the Times story and continuing problems with bad actors on the platform.\n\n\"There are lot of things I\u2019d do differently in retrospect,\" Zuckerberg said about the company's actions regarding the election meddling.\n\nEarlier in the day, Facebook fought back against the Times story.\n\n\"The story asserts that we knew about Russian activity as early as the spring of 2016 but were slow to investigate it at every turn. This is not true,\" Facebook wrote in a statement. \"We also saw some new behavior when [Russia-linked group] APT28-related accounts, under the banner of DC Leaks, created fake personas that were used to seed stolen information to journalists. We shut these accounts down for violating our policies.'\"\n\nWhen asked if Facebook monitors the messages of journalists on its platform, Zuckerberg replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nZuckerberg effectively said he would not step down as chairman of his board of directors when asked specifically by reporters. Many corporate governance experts said it's an inherent conflict of interest for a CEO to also be chairman.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think that specific proposal is the right way to go,\" he said, when asked if he'd give up the chairman role.\n\nActivist investors had already been pushing for Zuckerberg to step down as chair.\n\n\"I think The New York Times reporting illustrates exactly why we are recommending an independent board chair. The fact that they kept the board in the dark for so long shows us that an independent board chair is necessary,\" Jonas Kron, whose company Trillium Investments owns 53,000 shares of Facebook, told ABC News. \"We knew that already, but the report should remove any lingering doubts.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Facebook says it's getting better at removing hate speech", "description": "Facebook says it is making progress on deleting hate speech, graphic violence, fake accounts and rooting out other violations of its rules, including detecting them before they are seen by users", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/facebook-removing-hate-speech-59222697", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_abad66114ea740b1badbe30d5ca8ce71_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:20:59Z", "content": "Facebook says it's making progress on deleting hate speech, graphic violence and other violations of its rules and detecting problems before users see them.

The reports come as Facebook grapples with challenge after challenge, ranging from fake news to Facebook's role in elections interference, hate speech and incitement to violence in the U.S., Myanmar, India and elsewhere.\n\nThe company also said it disabled more than 1.5 billion fake accounts in the latest six-month period, compared with 1.3 billion during the previous six months. Facebook said most of the fake accounts it found were financially motivated, rather than aimed at misinformation. The company has nearly 2.3 billion users.\n\nFacebook's report comes a day after The New York Times published an extensive report on how Facebook deals with crisis after crisis over the past two years. The Times described Facebook's strategy as \"delay, deny and deflect.\"\n\nFacebook said Thursday it has cut ties with a Washington public relations firm, Definers, which the Times said Facebook hired to discredit opponents. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during a call with reporters that he learned about the company's relationship with Definers only when he read the Times report.\n\nOn community guidelines, Facebook also released metrics on issues such as child nudity and sexual exploitation, terrorist propaganda, bullying and spam. While it is disclosing how many violations it is catching, the company said it can't always reliably measure how prevalent these things are on Facebook overall. For instance, while Facebook took action on 2 million instances of bullying in the July-September period, this does not mean there were only 2 million instances of bullying during this time.\n\nClifford Lampe, a professor of information at the University of Michigan, said it's difficult for people to agree on what constitutes bullying or hate speech \u2014 so that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to teach artificial intelligence systems how to detect them.\n\nOverall, though, Lampe said Facebook is making progress on rooting out hate, fake accounts and other objectionable content, but added that it could be doing more.\n\n\"Some of this is tempered by (the fact that) they are a publicly traded company,\" he said. \"Their primary mission isn't to be good for society. It's to make money. There are business concerns.\"\n\nFacebook also plans to set up an independent body by next year for people to appeal decisions to remove \u2014 or leave up \u2014 posts that may violate its rules. Appeals are currently handled internally.\n\nFacebook employs thousands of people to review posts, photos, comments and videos for violations. Some things are also detected without humans, using artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg said creating an independent appeals body will prevent the concentration of \"too-much decision-making\" within Facebook.\n\nFacebook has faced accusations of bias against conservatives \u2014 something it denies \u2014 as well as criticism that it does not go far enough in removing hateful content."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Fed announces wide-ranging review of its practices", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

In type 2 diabetes (T2DM), either the pancreas is not making enough insulin, or the body has become resistant and needs more insulin to process sugar.\n\nBoth types are still difficult disorders to control physically as well as emotionally. There are some medications and exercise and diet changes can help reverse the symptoms of Type 2 diabetes, but there is no cure for Type 1 which is very cumbersome to control.\n\nYet in the past decades, there has been a rapid acceleration of new research and technology to help to make the lives of people with diabetes easier to manage.\n\nEric Strauss/ABC News\n\nInsulin pumps\n\nPatients with type 1 or type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes need the medication insulin to regulate their blood sugar. It can only be administered through the skin, and needs to be delivered into the body throughout the day. This can mean an average of four to six injections a day in the thigh or abdomen, which can be time-consuming and painful to manage in busy, everyday life.\n\nBut, insulin pumps are devices that can help provide continuous insulin without requiring multiple injections throughout the day. There are two types that both work in similar ways; One is a pod that contains the insulin, and the mechanism that delivers the insulin into the skin through sharp plastic tube that the user inserts. It connects wirelessly to a controller half the size of an iPhone.\n\nLos Angeles Times via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe second option is a small controller device that looks like an old-timey beeper that can clip on to clothing, connected with tubing to a thin plastic tube under the skin that the user inserts. They both provide a constant rate of insulin -- called a basel rate -- over 24 hours, to keep blood sugars in range when a person is not eating or overnight.\n\nWhen patients eat, they can enter into the pump how much they\u2019re going to eat, what their blood sugar level is, and administer additional insulin to cover the meal.\n\n\u201c \u201d Patients tell us they feel like they\u2019ve been cured.\n\nNewer insulin pump algorithms can even calculate when the blood sugar is trending lower, and automatically reduce the amount of delivered basal insulin.\n\nUsing an insulin pump takes training. A person needs to check their finger stick glucose frequently, input any carbohydrates they are going to eat, and learn to understand the different alerts that can pop up on the device. The pump is not permanent, and the insertion site does need to be replaced every few days.\n\nEric Strauss/ABC News\n\nThe freedom from injections that an insulin pump offers is quite significant. Studies have shown that use of pumps results in improved average glucose values (called hemoglobin A1cs) over 3 months, as well as fewer episodes of dangerous hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.\n\nPeople can decide when they want to eat, and how much they want to eat, with tighter control of how much insulin they administer to themselves.\n\nDexcom\n\nCGMs\n\nThe other half of current diabetes technology focuses on monitoring blood sugars. Normally, a person would prick their finger and use a machine called a glucometer to measure the blood sugar.\n\nFor someone with T1DM, this could mean pricking themselves between 4 and 20 times a day -- including before each meal and before bedtime. Most people check more frequently: before snacks, after they eat, when they feel their blood sugar is off, and sometimes in the middle of the night.\n\nNot only is this painful and disruptive, but finger sticks generally only provide a snapshot of glucose at a specific point in time. They do not provide glucose level trends (falling lower, climbing higher, or staying stable), or an accurate representation of how much time someone spends in a normal glucose range.\n\nEnter continuous blood glucose monitors, CGMs for short. These are devices, first created in 2006, that can be attached to the body with a small sensor under the skin to measure glucose levels as frequently as every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day, for up to 10 days (depending on the device).\n\n\u201c \u201d For patients having the hardest time with T1DM, and who have become extremely debilitated by glycemic lability and frequent, severe hypoglycemia, this therapy has been life-changing and really transformative. To hear ... what they\u2019ve been able to accomplish in their lives, from what they never thought they could do before, has been the most incredible part of this.\n\nMario Anzuoni/Reuters, FILE\n\nSome can notify the wearer if their glucose level is too high or too low, or even if it\u2019s heading in that direction, allowing them more control over their diabetes management. Many devices connect to smartphones, and can be shared with loved ones, so that they can help keep an eye out of dangerous glucose situations.\n\nThe CGM sensor needs to be replaced every few days.\n\nThere\u2019s another option called a flash glucose monitor that can be worn for up to 14 days, and provide a glucose reading when the wearer scans over it. It doesn\u2019t provide a constant stream of data, which can more desirable and less stressful.\n\nThis technology can all but eliminate the need for finger sticks, but it doesn\u2019t provide a constant stream of data. The amount of information a user desires is a personal choice, some find less data to be more desirable and less stressful where others want the constant readings of a CGM.\n\nCDC\n\nWhat about the \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d?\n\nPeople suffering from T1DM have a pancreas that has completely stopped making insulin. A potential solution may be an artificial pancreas. This promising technology would take the need for carb-counting, finger-sticking and manual entry of data out of the hands of the user -- the device could do all of that.\n\nCertain insulin pumps can communicate wirelessly with CGMs, and even have an algorithm that automatically adjusts the basal insulin rate depending on the trend of glucose from the CGM. We are still not yet at the point of completely worry free, hands-off T1DM management, at least for now.\n\nThese \u201chybrid closed-loop\u201d systems still require user input for when and what they are going to eat, and do not have glucagon, which is a hormone made in the pancreas that helps to raise blood sugar if needed.\n\nA Boston medical technology company called Beta Bionics is conducting research devoted to developing \u201cthe world\u2019s first fully autonomous bionic pancreas\u201d, according to a press release from earlier this year.\n\nThe firm has created the iLet Bionic Pancreas System, which is a \u201cdual-chamber, autonomous, infusion pump that mimics a biological pancreas\u201d, including both insulin and glucagon, and communicates with a CGM.\n\nUtilizing a machine-learning algorithm, the system will autonomously calculate and dose insulin and/or glucagon as needed, without requiring blousing or input from the user. This summer, they received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to begin clinical testing in a home setting of adults and children with T1DM. The company aims to finalize the design in 2019, and potentially launch their first product in 2020.\n\nCan I get a new pancreas?\n\nTechnology is not for everyone, and sometimes people wonder if it would be easier to just get a new pancreas. Not everyone can qualify for a pancreas transplant: currently it is only considered in people with serious complications of diabetes, such as end stage renal disease, or frequent severe low or high blood sugars.\n\nA full pancreas transplant is often done along with a kidney transplant in someone with both diabetes and end stage renal disease. It is a major abdominal surgery, and comes with the risks of such an extensive procedure.\n\nAfter the transplant, they will need to be on lifelong medications to suppress their immune system to avoid rejection of the new organ. Even after a successful surgery, rejection can still occur days to years after the surgery in up to 30 percent of people.\n\nThe goal of transplant is to allow people with T1DM the opportunity to no longer be dependent on insulin, and decrease complications from having diabetes over their lifetime. For those who have been able to get a pancreas transplant, most were able to stay off of insulin, maintain normal glucose levels, and avoid hypoglycemia for many years. Some studies show improvement for up to 15 years!\n\nA promising, less-invasive alternative is currently being developed: islet cell transplant.\n\nWhat is an islet cell transplant?\n\nIslet cell transplant is a minimally-invasive procedure that replaces specific cells of the pancreas that are destroyed by the autoimmune process in a person with T1DM.\n\nWith the gradual destruction over time, \u201cit becomes more and more difficult to control the lability in glucose levels, [which] leads to unstable glycemic control\u201d, according to Dr Michael Rickels, the medical director for Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation Program at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThey can develop hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, \u201cwhich can be severe, resulting in coma, seizure, [or] loss of consciousness that can be life threatening or even result in death.\u201d\n\nThe program at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania started in 2000, with the goal that islet cell transplant \u201ccan provide both insulin and glucagon secretion to maintain near normal levels of glycemia, [in an] appropriately regulated manner.\u201d\n\nInsulin production should turn off when it\u2019s supposed to, and glucagon can be made by the transplanted cells to prevent low blood sugars, or hypoglycemia.\n\nThe islet cells are collected from a deceased donor pancreas, purified, and delivered via a noninvasive procedure into the liver of the patient with T1DM.\n\nCDC\n\nAfter a few weeks, the islet cells grow a blood supply and can start to make their own insulin and glucagon hormones.\n\nIn 2004, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania was named one of five NIH-sponsored centers to proceed with transplantation as part of an FDA registered clinical trial.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2012, they successfully transplanted 11 individuals with T1DM and severe, frequent hypoglycemia. Of those, seven were able to stop insulin after the first transplant, and the remaining 4 were able to stop insulin after a second transplant.\n\nMore than half have remained off insulin for five or more years; the first transplant patient has been insulin-free for 10 years. One person did develop a recurrence of autoimmune diabetes, and three have required low doses of insulin, but not to the level of what they had previously required, and without hypoglycemia.\n\nDexcom\n\nAfter transplant, the recipient does need to be on lifelong, low dose immunosuppression to prevent both rejection of the transplanted islet cells and potential autoimmune destruction from the T1DM antibodies.\n\nIslet cell transplant has great potential for long term insulin independence, and Rickels\u2019 team is currently pursuing the biologic licensure process with the FDA, in hopes of having this available for patients with T1DM and severe hypoglycemia.\n\n\u201cPatients tell us they feel like they\u2019ve been cured,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor patients having the hardest time with T1DM, and who have become extremely debilitated by glycemic lability and frequent, severe hypoglycemia, this therapy has been life-changing and really transformative. To hear ... what they\u2019ve been able to accomplish in their lives, from what they never thought they could do before, has been the most incredible part of this.\u201d\n\nType 1 and type 2 diabetes affect millions of people, and the science and technology required to make their lives better is making incremental improvements.\n\nAll medical devices and insulin requires prescriptions and since each persona with diabetes is a unique case a discussion with medical professionals is appropriate.\n\nBut for those who suffer from diabetes, the potential to make their lives better and longer can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\nDr. Tiffany Yeh is currently an endocrinology fellow at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: First snowfall, a foggy forest, migrants view the US: World in Photos", "description": "Here's a look at the top photos from around the globe.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/snowfall-foggy-forest-migrants-view-us-world-photos-59220691", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/181115_world_photos_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:58:56Z", "content": "Now Playing: Wildfires rage, Stan Lee's Hollywood star and Emirati dancers: World in Photos Now Playing: Traders react, gold leaf applied and Michelle Obama: World in Photos, Nov. 14 Now Playing: First snowfall, a foggy forest, migrants view the US: World in \u2026 [+991 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for First snowfall, a foggy forest, migrants view the US: World in Photos\n\n--\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Italy's church acknowledges looming tax bill after ruling", "description": "Italy's Catholic Church says it will open talks with the government to respond to a European Court of Justice ruling that says Italy has the right to recover millions of euros in property taxes", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/italys-church-acknowledges-looming-tax-bill-ruling-59222391", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:57:35Z", "content": "Italy's Catholic Church says it will open talks with the government to respond to a European Court of Justice ruling that says Italy has the right to recover millions of euros in property taxes.

As a congressman, the far-right leader often complained about the Cuban doctors' program and tried to end it.\n\nIn a phone interview, former Health Minister Alexandre Padilha said the decision to pull out would leave millions of Brazilians without access to doctors.\n\nPadilha said Cuban doctors were in 2,800 cities and towns \u2014 and they were the only doctors in 1,700 of those towns. Padilha said the initiative was launched in 2013 because local doctors could not be found for many positions.\n\n\"This will have an immediate and terrible impact on the health care system,\" said Padilha. \"Cuban doctors are in the most vulnerable areas. They are in the Amazon, rural towns and in slums.\"\n\nBrazil, which includes the largest portion of the Amazon basin, is a vast country, a little bit larger than the continental United States. Many areas, particularly in the Amazon and historically poor Northeast region, are sparsely populated and lacking basic infrastructure.\n\nAfter Cuba's announcement Wednesday, Bolsonaro made a blistering critique of the program. Frequently referring to the Cuban government as a \"dictatorship,\" he said the program was \"slave work\" because the Cuban government keeps 70 percent of doctors' salaries. He also said Brazil had no way to verify if the doctors were truly qualified.\n\nNeither Bolsonaro nor the Cuban government has said when the estimated 8,500 Cuban doctors currently in Brazil would be leaving. Bolsonaro said Cuban doctors who asked for asylum would get it, though he stopped short of saying Brazil would provide that to any Cuban who asked.\n\nBolsonaro, who takes office Jan. 1, said he had signaled the program could only continue if doctors directly received their salaries from Brazil, were able to bring their families during their assignments and had their credentials verified.\n\n\"We have no proof that they are really doctors and able to take on these functions,\" Bolsonaro said.\n\nPadilha said the program, passed by Congress, already includes an evaluation of the doctors' credentials and language training; Brazil's national language is Portuguese and Cuba's is Spanish.\n\nThe former health minister said the doctors were not only highly qualified, but specialists in rural medicine, something that Brazil's health system badly lacks. He said the salary structure was something the Cuban government had worked out with more than 60 countries that participate in the program, and not something specific to Brazil.\n\n\"Bolsonaro doesn't understand that a doctor doesn't just practice medicine for money,\" said Padilha. \"Doctors who work in the poorest areas are not just thinking about money.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Stocks have struggled in 2018.

When U.S. stocks slide, say, bonds and gold can hopefully help offset the losses. Or maybe stocks abroad will hold up better than their U.S. counterparts.\n\nNot so this year. U.S. stocks have endured some breathtaking drops the last several weeks, slicing the S&P 500's year-to-date return to 2.2 percent after including dividends. But markets in Germany, South Korea, Hong Kong and elsewhere are solidly in the red year to date.\n\nEven worse for investors who carefully built up balanced portfolios to protect themselves from potential downturns: The investments that are supposed to offer safer returns have also struggled at the same time.\n\nIt's a rude reminder that one of the bedrock tenets of investing \u2014 don't keep too much of your portfolio concentrated in any one thing \u2014 doesn't guarantee success by itself. But it's also important to remember that this year's struggles have been a relative anomaly.\n\nIf conditions hold, this may be only the seventh time in the last 46 years that investors would have lost money if they had divvied up their portfolio equally among seven investment groups, including stocks, bonds and commodities, according to the Leuthold Group.\n\nSince 1973, investors would have gotten a 10.2 percent annualized return if they had a portfolio that split evenly each year across commodities, large U.S. stocks, small U.S. stocks, real-estate investment trusts, 10-year Treasurys, gold and foreign developed-market stocks. That's nearly as big a return as the S&P 500 itself, at 10.4 percent, with significantly less volatility.\n\n\"Given this strategy's required skill (none) and trading frequency (minimal), the results border on the remarkable,\" Leuthold's chief investment officer Doug Ramsey wrote in a recent report.\n\nThat's what makes this year's widespread pain so much more painful.\n\nStocks around the world have struggled amid worries about slowing economic growth, the threat of the global trade war and the impact of higher U.S. interest rates. Emerging-market stocks in particular have struggled, and stocks in Shanghai have sunk 24.3 percent in 2018.\n\nBonds, meanwhile, have been hit by rising interest rates. When rates climb, it makes the smaller interest payments paid by older bonds less attractive, and their prices correspondingly drop. The largest U.S. bond mutual fund, Vanguard's Total Bond Market index fund, has lost 2.4 percent this year. If it continues to drop, the fund could surpass its 2.7 percent loss in 1994 for its worst performance since it began trading in 1986.\n\nWhen markets around the world are suddenly shaky, investors often turn to gold for safety. But that, too, has struggled this year, and the GLD exchange-traded fund is down 7.3 percent in 2018. Gold often trades in the opposite direction of the U.S. dollar, and the dollar's value has climbed against rivals as a result of higher U.S. interest rates.\n\nGiven that rising interest rates have contributed to struggles for all kinds of investments this year, it's tempting to think that the value of diversification will stay diluted as rates rise further. But even during the 1970s and early 1980s, when interest rates were rising, balanced portfolios were still able to deliver mostly positive returns."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "A glance at US mortgage rates", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

That at the White House. And looks almost like white out conditions so let's go. Two meg Emily Rowell who is standing by there what's the latest what are you here. Hi David O'Leary northwest DC not all that far from the White House won awards does drag the weather here in the nation's capital today it is messy that wintry mix CC it's still coming down. Take a look behind me here traffic has been pretty sloppy here in DC this morning around eyes you can see. Are clear but it's still causing some headache and it's very slippery the commute to work this morning. Not a very good light now in terms accumulation of one a lot you lover in show audio we're dealing with all that might take a look. Really it's less than an inch but definitely a lot for DC enough to make it headaches. And the anything about today you will not only need your snow here your gloves your boots toward this weather here in DC you will often need the umbrella. This will turn into your rain and potentially caused flooding David sell a lot to be aware on today. If you are in and around Washington DC. Yikes I know that grew up here in the northeast where is somewhat better prepared for a major snowstorm we have the equipment to deal with it it's a rare event down there so it's. Harder for them to combative when it comes. But is this expected to to have a big impact on the government they expected. Is expected to snow so much that it's gonna shut down. What options where people could come in later or they could they could shift their schedules that tied that they. But if we pictures of the White House. I want to show you that because this potentially. I and all that much for not talking about a white ads here but I. It couldn't break a record at the White House they may get more or then happening snare it'll be the most snow that they've seen here in DC. Since 1989. Years under a 29 year record witnessed. It is still early in the season that first taste of winter Ford DC so pretty I think people are kind of things you get aside from that messy commute into work this morning if they did have to leave the house. But pretty intrastate when you think about the context here. That we break into record today David.

I've got to gather we've got you going there hey I can see it now housing what are you seeing from where you are. Well hi David images of that technical difficulty just finding cell service in many these areas is so difficult that fire came in. So hot and so fast that. In many areas the cell towers all the felt powerless completely were wiped out you mentioned Malibu of people are actors and we have to go back home in Malibu today many evacuees are. Heading back home but even there there's barely any sell servers and makes it difficult for people to community difficult for news crews like us to go live. I'm wearing Calabasas right now is another very. Hard hit area and you take a look this teen is one that were just is becoming all too common throughout Southern California the burned out cars. Burned out homes plot after plot that is entirely gone. But dividend one ashamed of though and I'm sure you've seen it already but it still is so jarring to me. I hear you are you see horrible damage burned out cars could homes that are gone but. Just across the street you have a home that's completely fine untouched unscathed. I'm in this is the type of I think that people are dealing with here this sort of mind boggling sense of of random threat that comes with the fire and we're told a couple reasons for that one is simply because. A means winds coming with the fires are so strong they throw sparks places so if you have a spark that lands on or near your home. Something like this could happen. We also that it deals public education and things of that nature so with landscaping at the spark lands on a large brush near your home that can also contribute to this kind of damage. David this scene is obviously so. Terrible heartbreaking to witness but I do want to mention the big breaking news out of Southern California for us at least. Is that there is new hope we have new hope today no high wind that we've been seeing offending mile per hour gusts of their way down to the winds have called. And we're even expecting the onshore wind that slate sea breeze to come tomorrow which would mean moisture in the air today it's still drive them we are expecting some moisture. Although we mention that Dreier I don't want you think we're out of the woods yet firefighters are cautioning people. To stay on high alert to stay on guard a just overnight in new brush fire broke out in Ventura county which is. A where the woolsey's fire also was. They've been battling that it seems that they have the upper hand but here's an example about even when you think you're sort of climbing out of the woods you have that containment you have. The weather on your side. Just a slight bargain started a new fire which could lead to more scenes like this when it. Absolutely devastating and even after this fire dies down I gather the next threat having covered some of these fires myself in the past. Is that the winter rains are likely to bring mudslides and so even those homes that are spared. Are still under threat. If such a good point we saw this happen last year and authorities are trying debt and stay on top of it more this year warning people that when you come home in. Find places that look like there's also the the hills behind you look like this bearing a wiped clean so that means when those heavy winds or rains hit there's nothing to catch him in that could cause. And virtually catastrophic mudslides so it it's really a sad scary scene here right now because not only are people coming home. And no homes but they know the name just a few months or weeks they could be hit with a different and also catastrophic natural disaster. ABC's bag truly thank you so much for keeping track comment.

In the 2018 midterm elections, Florida voters didn\u2019t answer those prayers.\n\nBut as recounts progressed toward a conclusion in three statewide Florida races, including the races for U.S. senator and governor, experts say those margins, as narrow they may seem, likely won\u2019t reverse the Election Day results.\n\nOut of more than 4,600 statewide general elections between 2000 and 2015, there were 27 statewide recounts \u2014 three of which resulted in reversals, according to FairVote, a group that advocates for electoral reform.\n\nIn other words, recounts are rare. Recounts that end in reversals are even rarer.\n\n\u201cTen percent of all statewide recounts in the 21st century are happening right now, as we speak,\u201d David O\u2019Brien, a staff attorney at FairVote and author of the recount analysis, said in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday. \u201cWhich just goes to show how uncommon they are.\u201d\n\nAnd if any of them end in reversal, O\u2019Brien said he\u2019d want to \u201creally dig in\u201d to find out why they became such outliers, suggesting potential reasons that would change the scope of the election, like systemic failure with ballot reading. \"It would be way beyond what we\u2019d seen of the reversals of the past.\"\n\nOne known difference already sets Florida apart: the more than 8.3 million votes that have been counted so far.\n\n\"None of the recounts we\u2019re looking at had votes that big,\" O'Brien said. \"And from what I know of the elections that did result in recounts, I don't know if they had the number of issues reported in Florida,\" he said, referring to lawsuits over vote counting in Broward and Palm Beach counties. The three cases of reversals after recounts cited in the report involved the races for Senate in Minnesota in 2008, auditor in 2006 in Vermont and governor in 2004 in Washington state.\n\n\"That being said, things would have to be extremely different from the races we\u2019d looked at,\" he said.\n\nNed Foley, a law professor at The Ohio State University who wrote a book documenting disputed elections throughout U.S. history, also spoke to the rarity of a reversal.\n\n\u201cIf we focus specifically on statewide races, it's absolutely true that it's very rare to overturn,\u201d Foley said.\n\nIt\u2019s also rare to see a recount in the first place, Foley explained, nevermind three of them in one state \u2014 but Florida fits the bill for such a situation, he said.\n\n\u201cIn a battleground state, this is more likely to arise,\u201d he said, and predicted that increased voter targeting would only increase the purple-ish tint of the state.\n\n\u201cBoth sides are more sophisticated in their messaging so it stands to reason that we\u2019re going to have closer elections in the world we live in now than we had in the 20th century, and I think this year is evidence of that,\u201d Foley later added.\n\nThe reason recount reversals are so rare, both Foley and O\u2019Brien explained, is because, generally, vote margins don\u2019t swing by more than a few hundred votes in statewide recounts, which isn\u2019t usually enough to change the winner.\n\nIn the case of Florida, the Senate race differed by 12,562 votes heading into the recount. The margin was bigger in the gubernatorial race: 33,684.\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nNot only would many more votes have to come in during the recount to have a big impact on the current numbers, but the votes would have to lean almost entirely toward one candidate, Foley said.\n\n\u201cMy instinct is its extraordinarily hard to overcome a lead of 10,000 or more, unless you tell me something about the nature of the ballots that have yet to be counted \u2014 unless you tell me why they would break so favorably for the candidate who was behind,\u201d Foley said.\n\nAccording to O\u2019Brien, the margin shift in Florida would have to be more than 20 times bigger than what they saw in other races where there were recounts for a reversal in the governor\u2019s race \u2014 and around 10 times bigger for the Senate race.\n\nAnd yet, the rhetoric from both Republican and Democrat camps would have voters believe the stakes are much higher.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing this year is in some respects familiar, in some respects new and different,\u201d Foley said. \u201cWhat is a new and unfortunately disconcerting development is the intensity of the rhetoric.\u201d\n\nRepublican Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for Senate, began claiming last week that his opponent, incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, was trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election \u2014 though neither courts nor the Florida Department of Law Enforcement back these claims. Nelson said Scott has \u201cthrown around words like voter fraud with no proof\u201d and accused him of \u201cusing his power as governor to try to undermine the voting process.\u201d\n\nJacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nThe president also weighed in. \u201cTrying to STEAL two elections in Florida! We are watching closely!\u201d he said in one tweet, without details or evidence.\n\n\u201cWhat frankly surprised me is how quickly the rhetoric got so hot and so contentious, given that the statewide races in Florida just aren't actually that close,\u201d Foley said, adding that while they\u2019re close enough to trigger automatic recounts, more than 10,000 vote margin in a statewide race \u201cis still an extraordinarily wide margin to be able to overcome.\u201d\n\nAnd the number of lawsuits in Florida, from both Nelson and Scott\u2019s campaigns, match the degree of rhetoric.\n\nThe escalation displays the country\u2019s \u201cAchilles heel,\u201d as Foley calls it, which is the need for neutral institutions to monitor elections, instead of partisan secretary of state offices, because \u201cdemocracy depends on a sense of fair play.\u201d\n\nReports out of Palm Beach and Broward County, both Democrat-leaning counties, increased politicization of the ballot counting, further proving the need for neutrality, Foley said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened so far this week is troublesome, and I\u2019m concerned about what it means when we have to go through this two years from now when the presidency is on the line,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich brings up another benefit of a recount, beyond solidifying a winner or reinvigorating an opponent: assuring people that the election played out the way it was supposed to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for people to figure out what went wrong in the election so lawmakers and policymakers can make changes to make sure those don't happen again,\u201d O\u2019Brien said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: President Trump again calls Mueller probe a 'witch hunt' in tweet", "description": "President Trump speaks out against Mueller probe amid incoming Dem Congress, U.S. Treasury sanctions 17 Saudi officials for role in journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/president-trump-calls-mueller-probe-witch-hunt-tweet-59220209", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/181115_vod_traver_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:17:28Z", "content": "Now Playing: McConnell: Mueller probe 'is not under threat' Now Playing: Saudi official: Crown prince did not order Khashoggi killing Now Playing: President Trump again calls Mueller probe a 'witch hunt' in tweet Now Playing: Who is Kevin McCarthy?

Eye drops. No outdoor exercise. This is how Californians are trying to cope with wildfires choking the state, but experts say an increase in serious health problems may be almost inevitable for vulnerable residents as the disasters become more commonplace.\n\nResearch suggests children, the elderly and those with existing health problems are most at risk.\n\nShort-term exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen existing asthma and lung disease, leading to emergency room treatment or hospitalization, studies have shown.\n\nIncreases in doctor visits or hospital treatment for respiratory infections, bronchitis and pneumonia in otherwise healthy people also have been found during and after wildfires.\n\nSome studies also have found increases in ER visits for heart attacks and strokes in people with existing heart disease on heavy smoke days during previous California wildfires, echoing research on potential risks from urban air pollution.\n\nFor most healthy people, exposure to wildfire smoke is just an annoyance, causing burning eyes, scratchy throats or chest discomfort that all disappear when the smoke clears.\n\nBut doctors, scientists and public health officials are concerned that the changing face of wildfires will pose a much broader health hazard,\n\n\"Wildfire season used to be June to late September. Now it seems to be happening all year round. We need to be adapting to that,\" Dr. Wayne Cascio, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cardiologist, said this week.\n\nIn an overview published earlier this year, Cascio wrote that the increasing frequency of large wildland fires, urban expansion into wooded areas and an aging population are all increasing the number of people at risk for health problems from fires.\n\nWood smoke contains some of the same toxic chemicals as urban air pollution, along with tiny particles of vapor and soot 30 times thinner than a human hair. These can infiltrate the bloodstream, potentially causing inflammation and blood vessel damage even in healthy people, research on urban air pollution has shown. Studies have linked heart attacks and cancer with long-term exposure to air pollution.\n\nWhether exposure to wildfire smoke carries the same risks is uncertain, and determining harm from smog versus wildfire smoke can be tricky, especially with wind-swept California wildfires spreading thick smoke hundreds of miles away into smoggy big cities.\n\n\"That is the big question,\" said Dr. John Balmes, a University of California, San Francisco, professor of medicine who studies air pollution.\n\n\"Very little is known about the long-term effects of wildfire smoke because it's hard to study populations years after a wildfire,\" Balmes said.\n\nDecreased lung function has been found in healthy firefighters during fire season. They tend to recover but federal legislation signed this year will establish a U.S. registry tracking firefighters and potential risks for various cancers, including lung cancer. Some previous studies suggested a risk.\n\nBalmes noted that increased lung cancer rates have been found in women in developing countries who spend every day cooking over wood fires.\n\nThat kind of extreme exposure doesn't typically happen with wildfires, but experts worry about the kinds of health damage that may emerge for firefighters and residents with these blazes occurring so often.\n\nWhether that includes more cancer is unknown. \"We're concerned about that,\" Balmes said.\n\nRegular folks breathing in all that smoke worry about the risks too.\n\nSmoke from the fire that decimated the Northern California city of Paradise darkened skies this week in San Francisco, nearly 200 miles southwest, and the air smelled \"like you were camping,\" said Michael Northover, a contractor.\n\nHe and his 14-year-old son have first-time sinus infections that Northover blames on the smoke.\n\n\"We're all kind of feeling it,\" Northover said.\n\nMost schools in San Francisco, Sacramento, Oakland and Folsom said they would be closed Friday because of poor air quality.\n\nAn Environmental Protection Agency website said that air quality in Sacramento was \"hazardous\" on Thursday afternoon and San Francisco's was \"very unhealthy.\" Many people walking around the cities wore face masks.\n\nClasses were canceled Thursday in at least six universities in Northern California as smoke from the fire continued to blanket all nine counties of the Bay Area. Some were closing all buildings but others, including Cal State East Bay said libraries, health centers and dining halls would stay open.\n\nAt Chico State University, 11 miles from Paradise, ash was falling this week and classes were canceled until after Thanksgiving.\n\n\"It's kind of freaky to see your whole town wearing air masks and trying to get out of smoke,\" said freshman Mason West, 18. \"You can see the particles. Obviously it's probably not good to be breathing that stuff in.\"\n\nWest returned home this week to Santa Rosa, hard hit by last year's wine country fire, only to find it shrouded in smoke from the Paradise fire 100 miles away. West's family had to evacuate last year for a week but their home was spared.\n\n\"It's as bad here as it was in Chico,\" West said. \"It almost feels like you just can't get away from it.\"\n\nSmoke has been so thick in Santa Rosa that researchers postponed a door-to-door survey there for a study of health effects of last year's fire.\n\n\"We didn't feel we could justify our volunteer interns going knocking on doors when all the air quality alerts were saying stay indoors,\" said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a public health researcher at the University of California, Davis. The study includes an online survey of households affected by last year's fire, with responses from about 6,000 people so far.\n\nPreliminary data show widespread respiratory problems, eye irritations, anxiety, depression and sleep problems around the time of the fire and months later.\n\n\"Conventional thinking is that these effects related to fires are transient. It's not entirely clear that's the case,\" Hertz-Picciotto said.\n\nResearchers also will be analyzing cord blood and placentas collected from a few dozen women who were pregnant during the fire, seeking evidence of stress markers or exposure to smoke chemicals.\n\nThey hope to continue the study for years, seeking evidence of long-term physical and emotional harms to fire evacuees and their children.\n\nOther studies have linked emotional stress in pregnant women to developmental problems in their children and \"this was quite a stress,\" Hertz-Picciotto said.\n\nIt's a kind of stress that many people need to prepare for as the climate warms and wildfires proliferate, she said.\n\n\"Any of us could wake up tomorrow and lose everything we own,\" she said. \"It's pretty scary.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner.

Add Democratic Party as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Democratic Party news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nLawmakers trying to oust Nancy Pelosi started rallying behind a possible contender Thursday, but the House Democratic leader gained key endorsements and said she has \"overwhelming support\" to become the next speaker.\n\nPelosi picked up backing from Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the civil rights leader, while a who's-who of Democrats \u2014 including former Vice President Al Gore and former Secretary of State John Kerry \u2014 advocated on her behalf.\n\n\"Look, I'm supporting Pelosi,\" said Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking Democrat and an influential leader of the Congressional Black Caucus. \"But I would never tell anybody not to run.\"\n\nOne member of the Black Caucus, Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, indicated a willingness to run against Pelosi for speaker when lawmakers return after Thanksgiving for first-round voting. She's an ally of Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who mounted an unsuccessful campaign against Pelosi two years ago and is a leader of the current effort to topple her.\n\nOthers may jump in, but have not yet.\n\nLewis, who marched during the civil rights era with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said he's supporting Pelosi \"more than 100 percent.\"\n\nPelosi has faced challenges before but this one \u2014 fueled by newcomers calling for change and frustrated incumbents who feel shut out of leadership after her many years at the helm \u2014 poses perhaps the biggest threat yet.\n\nWith a narrow Democratic majority, now at 230 seats, she does not have much cushion to secure the 218 votes needed on the floor if all Republicans vote against her, as expected. Some House races remain undecided and the Democratic majority could grow slightly.\n\nThere is a chance the math could shift in Pelosi's favor if lawmakers are absent or simply vote \"present,\" meaning she would need fewer than 218 votes for an absolute majority. The full chamber will elect the next speaker Jan. 3.\n\nPelosi has remained steadfast in her pursuit of the gavel and welcomed all challengers. Her latest catchphrase: \"Come on in, the water's warm.\"\n\nThe 78-year-old Californian was bombarded with questions about the speaker's race at her weekly press conference Thursday. \"I intend to win the speakership with Democratic votes,\" she said.\n\nAsked if sexism might block her return as the first woman to hold the office, she countered that's a question for the mostly male lawmakers signing a letter against her.\n\n\"If in fact there is any misogyny involved in it, it's their problem, not mine,\" Pelosi told reporters.\n\nSeventeen Democrats, led by Rep. Seth Moulton D-Mass., have pledged to vote against Pelosi's return as the first female speaker of the House. The list includes a dozen incumbents and five newcomers, including two Democrats whose races have not yet been decided. Confirmed by an aide to one of the organizers, the list was first published in the Huffington Post. It includes just three women.\n\nRep.-elect Jeff Van Drew, D-N.J., said he signed the letter and is sticking and with his campaign promise to not vote for Pelosi \u2014 \"not in the caucus and not on the floor,\" he said.\n\nHe said, \"There's something to be said for new ideas and showing that it's a change and having a different face.\"\n\nHe said people in his district were looking for \"somebody who could be a healer.\"\n\nAllies of Pelosi have churned out endorsements daily, with support from incoming House committee chairmen; leaders of outside organizations, including women's groups and labor unions; and others who align with Democrats and provide resources for elections.\n\nMany attest to Pelosi's skills at fundraising for the party, corralling the caucus and delivering votes. Her supporters say now is not the time for infighting when voters expect Democrats to stand up to President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Pelosi also acknowledges the discomfort some lawmakers face because she's the GOP's favorite election-year villain. Some 137,000 ads were run against her this election cycle, she said. \"It makes it hard on the candidates,\" she conceded.\n\nPointing to Democrats' midterm success \u2014 they regained control of the House with their biggest midterm victories since Watergate \u2014 she added, \"Obviously those ads didn't work.\"\n\n\"People don't even know who I am \u2014 an Italian-American grandmother with lots of energy, a mother of five, a grandmother of nine \u2014 who is here to do what's right for our future,\" said Pelosi.\n\nReferring to her opponents' campaign, she quipped, \"Have you seen the letter?\"\n\nThe letter-writers, led by Moulton, Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., and others, have yet to present it publicly. They promise to do so soon, but Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., said they were hoping to add a few more signatures.\n\nSchrader said it's a \"lie\" that Pelosi already has secured enough support, and that he would back Fudge. \"She has experience in running caucuses, fits the profile I think really well, she's tough,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats seeking to block Pelosi argue it's time to give younger lawmakers a chance to rise to high-level posts. They also say Republicans have done such a good job demonizing Pelosi that it's hard for Democrats to be elected in closely contested, moderate districts.\n\nNo declared challenger to Pelosi has emerged, but the group agitating for changes says there would be plenty of candidates should her bid be derailed.\n\nFinding a consensus candidate could prove daunting, and lawmakers hold mixed views about the prospect of a floor fight as the opening act of the new Congress.\n\nPelosi made history when she became the first female speaker of the House in 2007. She assumed the post after Democrats took control of the House in midterm elections during former President George W. Bush's second term.\n\nAs speaker under former President Barack Obama, she played a crucial role in passing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis year, many Democrats won after running campaigns focused on health care and preserving the law's insurance protections for those with pre-existing health conditions.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Laurie Kellman and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/lisamascaro and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Politics"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Jonathan Frontado", "title": "Here\u2019s What \u2018Frozen\u2019 Songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez Thought of Their Family\u2019s Disney Cruise to Alaska", "description": "Over the summer, the award-winning, husband-and-wife songwriting team, Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, took their daughters on an adventure they won\u2019t soon forget \u2013 a Disney cruise to Alaska.

The mission succeeded and a number of rebels were captured, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nCongo's volatile east is home to many armed groups vying for control of the mineral-rich region, and the Allied Democratic Forces and Mai-Mai rebel groups are especially active in the Beni area.\n\nThe Security Council called on all armed groups to stop the violence immediately and lay down their arms, echoing an earlier statement from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman.\n\nThe U.N. chief and the council urged Congolese authorities to apprehend and bring to justice the perpetrators of attacks on civilians, national security forces and U.N. peacekeepers.\n\nThe Security Council underlined \"that deliberate attacks targeting peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law.\" Council members also stressed that \"involvement in planning, directing, sponsoring or conducting attacks\" against peacekeepers or U.N. personnel are a basis for sanctions.\n\nGuterres and the council praised the bravery of peacekeepers from Malawi and Tanzania. They said the peacekeepers operate in \"an exceptionally difficult environment\" to protect local populations against attacks from armed groups.\n\nThe Allied Democratic Forces group originated in Uganda as a rebel movement against that country's government and carried out deadly bombings in the 1990s. A military campaign forced them to relocate to eastern Congo.\n\nSince October 2014, the group's fighters have killed more than 1,500 people in the Beni region, where Wednesday's attack took place. U.N. investigators blamed the Allied Democratic Forces for the deadliest single assault on the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo in almost 25 years, an attack last Dec. 7 at a base in Semuliki near Beni that killed 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers, wounded 43 others, and left one peacekeeper missing.\n\nIn recent attacks, the group has also killed civilians and abducted children in the Beni region.\n\nRebel attacks have forced suspension of crucial efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak in some areas.\n\nDr. Peter Salama, the emergencies chief for the World Health Organization, predicted Tuesday that Congo's Ebola outbreak, which has killed more than 200 people, will last at least six more months.\n\nHe said makeshift health facilities offering both traditional and modern treatment have become \"major drivers\" of the current, deadly transmission and are believed to be linked to more than half of the cases in Beni, the largest city affected by the current outbreak.\n\nSalama said the outbreak is \"arguably the most difficult context that we've ever encountered,\" pointing to activities of two armed rebel groups in the region."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Who is Kevin McCarthy?", "description": "Republican Kevin McCarthy serves as Representative for California's 23rd Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/kevin-mccarthy-59219698", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/181115_vod_orig_kevinmccarthy_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:57:04Z", "content": "Now Playing: A replacement for House Speaker Paul Ryan Now Playing: Kevin McCarthy announces House will vote Thursday on GOP health care bill Now Playing: President Trump again calls Mueller probe a 'witch hunt' in tweet Now Playing: Who is Kevin McCarthy?

His fans included not just musicians, but baseball great Mickey Mantle. The Yankees outfielder was moved to tears by \"Yesterday When I Was Young\" and for years made Clark promise to sing it at his memorial \u2014 a request granted after Mantle died in 1995.\n\nBeginning in 1983, Clark operated the Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre in Branson, Missouri, and was one of the first country entertainers to open a theater there. Dozens followed him.\n\nHe was a touring artist as late as the 2000s. Over the years, he played at venues around the world: Carnegie Hall in New York, the Sporting Club in Monte Carlo, the Grand Palace in Brussels and the Rossiya Theatre in Moscow.\n\nClark was born in Meherrin, Virginia, and received his first guitar on his 14th Christmas. He was playing in his father's square dance band at age 15.\n\nIn the 1950s, Clark played in bands in the Washington, D.C., area. In 1960, he got the chance to front the band of country singer Wanda Jackson. He also performed regularly in Las Vegas.

Aston Martin joined the electric car club with its Rapide E sedan.

The EPA is appealing that 2-1 ruling to a full panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nHawaii passed legislation in June that will ban the use of the pesticide in January.\n\nAn environmental group blasted the new recommendations as toothless and said California should be taking the pesticide off the market after scientists for three state agencies found it was toxic and couldn't be safely used at any levels.\n\n\"Unfortunately, these are voluntary recommendations for local officials that have no weight of law behind them,\" said Paul Towers of the Pesticide Action Network. \"Instead of taking this brain-harming pesticide off the market, California officials are again passing the buck.\"\n\nThe California action comes as the state considers long-term regulations to restrict the use of chlorpyrifos and designate it as a \"toxic air contaminant\" that poses a risk of serious illness or death.\n\nFarmworkers in the nation's leading agricultural state have been sickened several times in recent years when the pesticide drifted.\n\nMore than three dozen workers harvesting cabbage in Kern County last year were affected when the pesticide drifted from neighboring farms, causing some to become nauseous and vomit and sending some for medical treatment, the department said.\n\nAt least 13 people were affected in four incidents this year, including 10 workers in Solano County where the pesticide was applied to an almond orchard in July.\n\nThe pesticide is in a class of organophosphates chemically similar to a nerve gas developed by Nazi Germany before World War II. Its heavy use has often left traces in drinking water sources. A University of California at Berkeley study in 2012 found that 87 percent of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of the pesticide.\n\nUnder pressure from federal regulators, the company voluntarily withdrew chlorpyrifos for use as a home insecticide in 2000. EPA also placed \"no-spray\" buffer zones around sensitive sites, such as schools, in 2012.\n\nDowDuPont disagreed with the recommendations and said it would hurt growers who rely on the pesticide, spokesman Gregg Schmidt said.\n\nThe Almond Board of California said in a statement that its growers would follow state and federal regulations.\n\nThe action by California comes as the state proposes designating chlorpyrifos as a \"toxic air contaminant\" that poses a risk of serious illness or death.\n\nIn the meantime, the department is recommending county agriculture commissioners, who issue pesticide application permits, adopt the restrictions in January so they can protect health.\n\n\"This is like our short-term fix,\" department spokeswoman Charlotte Fadipe said. \"We've already started down a longer road to a permanent fix.\"\n\nOther recommendations include creating a 150-foot setback from homes, businesses and schools where the pesticide is applied. During applications, there would have to be a quarter-mile buffer zone for 24 hours around any field where the pesticide is applied and the only people allowed inside the area would be authorized applicators.\n\nThe department also recommended limiting use of chlorpyrifos to certain crops to combat specific pests, such as weevils and certain types of aphids on alfalfa, stink bugs on almonds and maggots on leafy vegetables and onions.."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Father of teen trapped in van speaks out about the handling of his son's death", "description": "Ron Plush, father of 16-year-old Kyle Plush, raises concerns about emergency response protocol following his son's death due to asphyxiation in his van at school.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/father-teen-trapped-van-speaks-handling-sons-death-59218809", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181115_abc_kyleplushdeathMIX_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:31:37Z", "content": "Now Playing: Teen who died mysteriously in his car repeatedly called 911 for help Now Playing: Father of teen trapped in van speaks out about the handling of his son's death Now Playing: News headlines today: Nov. 15, 2018 Now Playing: New York Times report a\u2026 [+1189 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Father of teen trapped in van speaks out about the handling of his son's death\n\nCarlos unforgettable.

In order to protect that land, the Interior Department employs more than 4,000 law enforcement agents - the third largest presence in the federal government.\n\nThat number includes National Park rangers and U.S. Park Police, but also federal agents from the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\nABC News, Mationalmap.gov\n\nThe Interior Department's primary mission is to protect natural resources in the parks, which can be damaged when too many people walk, drive, or leave trash. Law enforcement within the parks and monuments have an agreement to cooperate with agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which have complained in the past that restrictions intended to protect the environment made it more difficult to arrest undocumented migrants or stop routes for people entering the country illegally.\n\nCBP is the agency primary in charge of border apprehensions, arresting nearly 400,000 people near the border this year \u2013 a level on par with 2016 before Trump took office.\n\nAccording to figures released by the Interior Department, agents in national monuments and protected wilderness on the border apprehended and turned over 4,010 people to CBP custody and seized 2,356 pounds of drugs.\n\nAn additional 469 people were eventually arrested outside of federal lands.\n\nDavid McNew/Getty Images, FILE\n\nInterior's new role as an aggressive arm of immigration enforcement could become a new focus for Democrats next year, who took control of the House in the last midterm elections.\n\nRep. Raul Grijalva, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, said he has been concerned that U.S. Park Police officers who typically patrol Washington, DC, New York and San Francisco, were sent to the border after Zinke announced a \"surge\" to the border last May.\n\nGrijalva asked Zinke then for more information on what the officers would be doing and whether other parks would be understaffed as a result. Grijalva's office said the congressman never got answers.\n\nThe Interior Department cited security concerns when declining to provide ABC News figures on how many officers were sent to the border, where they are working or what they would be doing.\n\n\"We have sought details from the Interior Department about their border activities and they have not been forthcoming,\" Grijalva said in a statement provided to ABC News. \"There is very good reason to doubt their claims, just like there was good reason to doubt the president\u2019s claims about the so-called caravan Republicans seem to have suddenly forgotten about.\"\n\nGrijalva represents Arizona which includes public lands like the Oregon Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Cabeza Prieta Wildlife Refuge. Multiple groups, including the Tohono O'odham Nation which lives in southern Arizona and Mexico, have said they strongly oppose what they call militarization at the border and want the military and parks law enforcement to step back.\n\nBefore this month's elections, Trump made immigration his focus.\n\nHe tweeted often about the dangers of a slow-moving caravan of migrants moving north through Mexico expected to seek asylum in the U.S. Last week, the administration announced a new plan to deter asylum seekers by refusing to consider applicants who cross the border outside a designated port of entry.\n\nCorey Maisch/U.S. Army/Reuters\n\nDarren Cruzan, the agency's head of law enforcement, said the Interior Department didn't dramatically change its policies this year when it comes to immigration. He said the agency has always played a law enforcement role in helping CBP enforce immigration laws.\n\nHe said the uptick in apprehensions likely reflects Park Police and other law enforcement outfits \"paying attention\" to areas near border crossings. The agency, he said, is taking its cues from border patrol to identify areas where rangers should increase patrols.\n\n\"Our priority is to protect the resources on DOI-managed land,\" Cruzan said in an interview. \"So what we said is, 'Are there locations along the border where we are already doing our normal duties where we can be of assistance?'\"\n\nU.S. border policy for decades has pushed people seeking to cross the border onto more remote, dangerous areas, which includes areas of desert that are managed by the National Park Service and other agencies. Border patrol officials adopted the strategy of \"prevention through deterrence\" in 1994 and since then, more agents and equipment have been stationed along the border to reroute migrants attempting to reach urban areas.\n\nBut that effort to make it more difficult to cross into the U.S. illegally also resulted in more deaths among migrants, according to a 2010 government report and reports from advocacy groups.\n\nCaitlin OHara/Getty Images\n\nIn 2002, after a park ranger in Arizona was shot and killed by a man who crossed the border illegally, the Interior Department called for more focus on enforcing border security on federal lands.\n\nStill, the focus in recent years by the Interior Department hasn't only been nabbing illegal migrants.\n\nFred Patton, a former chief park ranger at the Oregon Pipe Cactus National Monument, said park rangers were focused on stopping illegal border crossings but through an environmental lens because their primary mission was still to protect the land, visitors, and staff in the park. Patton said that during the mid-2000s, his park had about 10 to 12 rangers to patrol the 28 miles of border between Arizona and Mexico.\n\nPatton said its difficult to compare the number of apprehensions over time because it's influenced by other factors, including overall trends in migration across the border, other border security operations that might force migrants onto federal land, and the emphasis and resources on border operations within the department. But he said he's glad to see Zinke's support for the efforts on the border.\n\n\u201cIf the secretary of the Interior mandates that this is a priority, that trickles down all the way to the operations level,\u201d he said.\n\nZinke says the Interior Department is also increasing its law enforcement presence on the border in anticipation of the arrival of a caravan of migrants from Honduras and other countries. Some migrants that were part of the caravan are expected to reach the border near San Diego this weekend and some have arrived at the border in Tijuana."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Chief of Iran Social Security Organization dies in car crash", "description": "Iran's state TV is reporting that the managing director of the country's social security agency and his deputy have been killed in a car crash in northern Iran", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chief-iran-social-security-organization-dies-car-crash-59218858", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:23:34Z", "content": "Iran's state TV is reporting that the managing director of the country's social security agency and his deputy have been killed in a car crash in northern Iran.

He said Jawad is religiously moderate, unlike some other members of the group, and likes to listen to music.\n\n\"He is not a big official with the party. I never heard that he has a security or military post,\" the man said.\n\nAnother person familiar with the group also cast doubt on the \"rising star\" narrative or that he was a high-ranking member of the group.\n\nHezbollah declined a request by The Associated Press to comment on the State Department action. The group generally dismisses sanctions imposed on Hezbollah members as ineffective and part of psychological propaganda against the group. The Israeli Foreign Ministry also declined comment, while a Palestinian senior security official said Hezbollah stopped its activity in the West Bank and Gaza after the second intifada, or uprising, which ended in 2005.\n\nAlthough his rank and role within the group have remained ambiguous, the round-faced Nasrallah is not the reclusive type, as senior Hezbollah commanders tend to be.\n\nHe has appeared publicly on numerous occasions, including at book signing events in 2007, when he published a collection of poems called \"Resistance Letters.\" The book focuses on the role of poetry in resistance with poems that glorify those who died fighting Israel, including his elder brother, Hadi, who died while fighting Israel in south Lebanon in 1997.\n\nIn one poem called \"Shukran,\" or \"Thank you,\" he writes: \"From the heart, thank you to the most beautiful father, thank you for being my inspiration, my father and my commander.\"\n\nIn an interview with a local TV station in that same year, Jawad refused to give details about his role within the group, only saying that he dedicated his life to the resistance. He said he likes music and movies, including comedy films, history and documentary movies.\n\nHe was active on Twitter for a while, before his account was suspended.\n\nThe Trump administration has ramped up pressure on Iran and Hezbollah since withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal last year. On Tuesday, the Department of Treasury also announced it was imposing sanctions on four Hezbollah operatives who were said to have provided financial, material and technological support to Hezbollah in Iraq.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah, West Bank and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Bopha Phorn", "title": "'Rabid' raccoons turn out to be drunk on fermented crabapples", "description": "Police apprehended masked bandits who were drunkenly acting up in a West Virginia town -- but they weren't humans.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/rabid-raccoons-turn-drunk-fermented-crabapples/story?id=59217152", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/raccoon-ht-er-181115_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:01:05Z", "content": "Police in West Virginia have apprehended masked bandits who were drunkenly acting up in town -- but they weren't humans.

They initially sought to raise $10,000, but the wildly successful GoFundMe campaign brought in over $400,000 and triggered an \"international media blitz\" that furthered the fraudulent campaign, Coffina said.\n\nNearly every shred of the trio's story, including the part that Bobbitt used his last $20 to help McClure out of a roadside jam when she ran out of gas, was bogus, Coffina said.\n\nBurlington County Prosecutors office/AP\n\n\"The entire campaign was predicated on a lie,\" Coffina said. \"Less than an hour after the GoFundMe campaign went live McClure, in a text exchange with a friend, stated that the story about Bobbitt assisting her was fake.\"\n\nIn one of the texts read by Coffina, McClure allegedly wrote to a friend, \"Ok, so wait, the gas part is completely made up but the guy isn't. I had to make something up to make people feel bad. So, shush about the made up stuff.\"\n\n'They hit the casinos hard'\n\nGoFundMe, which has cooperated in the investigation, has agreed to refund money to the 14,000 people who donated to Bobbitt.\n\n\"While this type of behavior by an individual is extremely rare, it's unacceptable and clearly it has consequences. Committing fraud, whether it takes place on or offline is against the law. We are fully cooperating and assisting law enforcement officials to recover every dollar withdrawn by Ms. McClure and Mr. D'Amico,\" GoFundMe said in a statement.\n\nCoffina said the suspected fraudsters might have gotten away with the scam had Bobbitt not filed a lawsuit against McClure and D'Amico in August, accusing them of withholding the funds from him.\n\nABC News\n\nThe money is all gone, most of it allegedly squandered by McClure and D'Amico on luxury handbags, a New Year's trip to Las Vegas and a BMW; the couple also used the donated funds to pay back $9,000 they owed to relatives and \"hit the casinos hard,\" Coffina said. Bank records showed they withdrew more than $85,000 at or near casinos in Atlantic City, Philadelphia and Las Vegas, he said.\n\nMcClure, 28, D'Amico, 39, and Bobbitt, 34, were all charged with second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception. McClure and D'Amico voluntarily surrendered to authorities on Wednesday, and have since been released, Coffina said. If convicted, each of them faces five to 10 years in prison, prosecutors said.\n\nThey were ordered to appear in court on Christmas Eve.\n\nBobbitt was arrested Wednesday night by the Philadelphia Police Department on charges of being a fugitive from justice, according to Philadelphia police. He is expected to be extradited to Burlington County to face charges related to the GoFundMe case.\n\nReached Thursday, an attorney for McClure and D'Amico told ABC News, \"We have no comment. Have a nice day.\"\n\nMedia blitz\n\nIn numerous media appearances, McClure claimed she was driving to meet a friend in September 2017 when she ran out of gas around midnight on the I-95 exit ramp near Philadelphia and Bobbitt, who was sleeping under a nearby overpass, came to her rescue. She claimed Bobbitt spent his last $20 to buy her gas.\n\n\"I pulled over to the side of the road as far as I could and I was going to get out and walk to the nearest gas station because it was not that far away, and that's when I met Johnny,\" McClure said last November in a \"Good Morning America\" interview. \"He walked up and he said, 'Get back in the car. Lock the doors. I'll be back.' I was just like, 'OK.'\"\n\nShe said Bobbitt used his panhandling money to get her out of the jam.\n\n\"I almost couldn't believe it,\" McClure added. \"I said, 'Thank you...I swear, I'll be back. I promise I'll be back to give you [the] money back.'\"\n\nHoping to repay Bobbitt for the apparent generous act, McClure said she and D'Amico set up a GoFundMe online. The fund was launched on Nov. 10, 2017, just hours after D'Amico took a of photo of McClure posing with Bobbitt near the I-95 exit ramp, Coffina said.\n\n\"I just got her gas to help her get back on her way. I didn't think anything about it. I wasn't expecting anything in return,\" Bobbitt told \"Good Morning America.\" \"That's how I got the money to start with -- from other people. [I had to] return the favor. I can't constantly take and not give back.\"\n\n'No Good Deed'\n\nCoffina said investigators believe McClure and D'Amico first met Bobbitt about a month before they launched the GoFundMe campaign near the Sugarhouse Casino in Philadelphia, close to the I-95 off-ramp where Bobbitt was living on the streets at the time.\n\nAsked who came up with the idea of the scam, Coffina noted a 2012 post Bobbitt made on his Facebook page that was \"remarkably similar\" to the narrative on the GoFundMe page.\n\nABC News\n\n\"He reported that he helped a woman who had both run out of gas and had a flat tire at a Walmart, spent his last supper money to get her on her way and fix her flat tire,\" Coffina said. \"I don't think that's a coincidence.\"\n\nAmong the few things about the story that's true is that Bobbitt did serve in the Marine Corps and was homeless, Coffina said.\n\nMilitary records obtained by ABC News show that Bobbit served in the Marines as an ammunition technician from December 2002 to February 2004 and was awarded a National Defense Service Medal.\n\n\"He deserves our appreciation for his willingness to serve our country as a United States Marine and he has our sympathy and concern for the homelessness that he's experienced, as well as his publicized struggle with addiction,\" Coffina said. \"But it is imperative to keep in mind that he was fully complicit in the scheme to defraud contributors, promoting the campaign in multiple media appearances and posing with Amico and McClure for a Philadelphia Inquirer story in front of a gas station that he did not buy gas from.\"\n\nIn August, Bobbitt filed a lawsuit accusing McClure and D'Amico of committing fraud by taking more than half of the money they raised for themselves. His pro bono attorney alleged in court papers that the couple treated the donations like their \"personal piggy bank to fund a lifestyle that they could not otherwise afford.\"\n\nD'Amico and McClure denied the allegations.\n\nIn September, the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal investigation into the missing GoFundMe donations and raided the couple's home, seizing a BMW and other belongings.\n\nCoffina said that even after burning through most of the money and getting sued by Bobbitt, D'Amico was allegedly thinking of ways to keep the scam going, including landing a book deal.\n\n\"He was certain the payday from the book deal they were pursuing would dwarf the money from the GoFundMe campaign,\" Coffina said. \"A few months later, when the dispute with Bobbitt became public D'Amico was not dissuaded. Instead, he pitched a title for the book that would encompass the controversy, 'No Good Deed.'\"\n\nHe was a 'fine young man'\n\nBobbitt's 81-year-old grandmother, Betty Grissom, of North Carolina, told ABC News Thursday that Bobbitt had always been a \"fine young man.\"\n\n\"He had been in the Marines and he worked with a paramedic group and we all heard ... how great he was, and he just let the drugs take over,\" said Grissom, adding that she hasn't seen or heard from her grandson since he left her house in 2014.\n\n\"When he had his drug problem, I know he did things he should not have done, but I cannot believe he was involved in this type of hoax,\" Grissom said. \"Until Johnny comes and tells me personally he did it, I cannot believe it.\"\n\nABC News' Luis Martinez, Alex Hosenball and Gerry Wagschal contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Experts seek ways to boost extreme wildfire survival rates", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Many of the ranchers and farmers who once managed those landscapes are gone, leaving terrain thick with vegetation that can explode into flames.\n\nThat's set the stage for tragedy, as whipping winds, high temperatures and drought that are characteristic of climate change stoke wildfires like those raging in Northern and Southern California, killing at least 59 people in recent days with 130 others missing.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were told to evacuate ahead of the blazes. Some experts say there has been an over-reliance on evacuation and too little attention paid to making communities safe, plus not enough money for preventive measures.\n\nSearch crews found many victims inside or next to their vehicles, killed trying to flee. Survivors of the blaze that nearly obliterated the Northern California town of Paradise spoke of having minutes to escape and narrow roads rendered impassable by flames and traffic jams.\n\nThere are \"so many ways that can go wrong, in the warning, the modes of getting the message out, the confusion,\" said Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension program.\n\nMoritz urged consideration of the creation of community \"retreat zones\" where residents can ride out deadly firestorms if escape seems impossible. That could be a community center, built or retrofitted to better withstand wildfires that can top 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit and reduce ordinary homes to ash.\n\nSuch fire protection can include sprinklers, fire- and heat-resistant walls and roofs, and barriers to keep sparks out of chimneys and other openings, according to the International Code Council, a nonprofit that helps develop U.S. building codes.\n\nCreating more buffers around housing developments would help stave off wildfires. They could be parks or irrigated agriculture, like the vineyards that helped keep last year's wildfires in California wine country from spreading into even more towns.\n\nAlso helpful would be burying electric power lines, which can spark and fail in high winds that drive many of California's fiercest fires, said Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey in California.\n\nSparks from utility equipment are suspected in the Northern California wildfire that consumed Paradise, destroying thousands of homes.\n\nA proven method to guard against destructive fires is controlled burns. By intentionally lighting fires when conditions are right, property owners remove low-lying trees and brush that otherwise act as fuel.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, California ranchers burned hundreds of thousands of acres annually to manage their lands, said Lenya Quinn-Davidson, director of the Northern California Prescribed Fire Council.\n\nThat was phased out in the 1980s after California's fire management agency took over the burns. By last decade, the burned acreage dropped to less than 10,000 acres annually, Quinn-Davidson said.\n\nAgricultural land surrounding many towns became overgrown, and housing developments pushed deeper into rural areas. Such was the case with the Northern California town of Redding ahead of a fire that began in July and destroyed more than 1,000 homes. It was blamed for eight deaths.\n\n\"You get these growing cities pushing out \u2014 housing developments going right up into brush and wooded areas. One ignition on a bad day, and all that is threatened,\" Quinn-Davidson said. \"These fires are tragic, and they're telling us this is urgent.\"\n\nThe recent California fires set off a debate over what's to blame. President Donald Trump claimed in a tweet Saturday that \"gross mismanagement of the forests\" was the sole reason the state's fires had become so \"massive, deadly and costly.\" He also threatened to withhold federal payments.\n\nBut most of California's recent deadly fires are in grasslands and brushy chaparral \u2014 not thick forest, Keeley said. \"Thinning isn't going to change anything,\" he said.\n\nTrump's assertion also ignored the huge federal land holdings in the state. It brought a quick backlash from the president of the California firefighters union, who described it as a shameful attack on thousands of firefighters.\n\nTo ease tensions, the White House sent Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to tour fire-damaged areas. Zinke struck a conciliatory tone and offered assistance in a meeting with California Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\n\"We need to work in unison to make sure we thin the forest, especially fire breaks, and make sure we have prescribed burns,\" Zinke told The Associated Press. \"There's been a lack of management on Interior lands, on U.S. Forest Service lands and certainly with state lands.\"\n\nCalifornia, not the Trump administration, is putting more money behind such efforts. In September, Brown signed a law providing $1 billion over five years for fire protection, including more controlled burns and tree clearing.\n\nFederal spending on hazardous fuels reduction has been flat in recent years, hovering just under $600 million, even as direct firefighting costs jumped to a record $2.9 billion last year.\n\nFor 2019, the Forest Service has proposed a $3 million bump for its wildfire fuels program. At Interior, Zinke proposed a $29 million cut in fuel management spending.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Matthew Brown on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MatthewBrownAP ."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "IMF executive board will meet in 'coming weeks' on Venezuela", "description": "The International Monetary Fund says its executive board will meet in the \"coming weeks\" to discuss the failure of the Venezuelan government to provide updated figures on its troubled economy", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/imf-executive-board-meet-coming-weeks-venezuela-59217660", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:42:11Z", "content": "The International Monetary Fund said Thursday its executive board will meet in the \"coming weeks\" to discuss the failure of the Venezuela n government to provide updated figures on its troubled economy.

The trial is off Friday and resumes Monday with more testimony from Zambada.\n\nIn his second day on the witness stand in federal court in Brooklyn, Zambada described the Sinaloa cartel's history of greed, cunning and violence as it built a cocaine-smuggling empire that made billions of dollars by flooding the market in large U.S. cities.\n\nTurf wars that broke out between rival teams of gun-toting sicarios meant \"there was always a lot of deaths,\" Zambada said, and he admitted he was involved in three murder plots of his own. He also survived a shootout on a Mexico City street with a graze wound on the right the side of his head.\n\nZambada, 57, who has been in police custody since 2008 and is being held in U.S. custody, is the first of several cooperators who are testifying against Guzman in hopes of leniency at sentencing. The defense says the deals have given them an incentive to exaggerate the role of Guzman, who pleaded not guilty after being extradited to the U.S. last year.\n\nMuch of Zambada's testimony focused on bribery, one of his main duties as top lieutenant to the cartel-s top bosses - his older brother, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, and Guzman. Based in Mexico City, where he kept watch over tons of cocaine stashed in a warehouse, Jesus Zambada claimed he bought off federal and local police, prosecutors, airport officials and authorities in the city at a cost of about $300,000 a month in exchange for information and protections that kept the sprawling drug operation running smoothly.\n\nHe testified Guzman once dispatched him to the state of Guerrero in 20014 to give a military general there $100,000 in cash.\n\nThe general \"is a friend of mine,\" he recalled Guzman telling him. \"Give him a hug and notify him that I'll be working around the state.\"\n\nZambada hadn't yet met Guzman when the kingpin escaped from prison by hiding in a laundry bin in 2001 and on the run in the Mexican countryside. He testified his older brother, worried that a special military force was closing in on Guzman, arranged to have a helicopter extract him from the area and instructed his sibling to find a \"semi-deserted location\" in central Mexico where it could land.\n\nWhen the helicopter touched down, the Zambadas were there to greet him. The older one and Guzman embraced before the younger one, along with his wife, whisked him away in the backseat of his car, he testified.\n\nAs they approached a toll booth on the nearly three-hour drive to Mexico City, Zambada urged Guzman \"to put a newspaper in front of his face because he was very wanted then.\"\n\nLater, at the sight of the Mexico City police approaching the car, Guzman looked troubled, he said. That was before he informed him he had arranged for the escort.\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" he said to Guzman. \"These are our people.

Bruce Poliquin in the first round of balloting in Maine's new voting system , came from behind to flip the U.S. House seat representing one of two congressional districts in the state, election officials said Thursday.\n\nElection officials declared the state lawmaker the winner after a federal judge denied Poliquin's request to halt tabulations in the state's ranked-choice voting system used in last week's election.\n\nThe outcome was a dramatic reversal in a four-way race.\n\nPoliquin received the most first-place votes on Election Day but additional tallies were required because no one won a majority. After additional round of voting, Poliquin lost by fewer than 3,000 votes, officials said.\n\nThe ranked-choice voting system lets voters rank candidates from first to last on the ballot. It provides for eliminations of last-place candidates and reallocations of votes to ensure a majority winner.\n\nMaine's election marked the first use of the system in U.S. House and Senate races. A lawsuit by Poliquin contends the system is unconstitutional.\n\nThe legal challenge by Poliquin and three GOP activists served as the backdrop in the most expensive congressional race in state history, which pitted Golden, a Marine Corps veteran, against Poliquin, the two-term incumbent.\n\nThe first round of voting on Election Day ended with Poliquin and Golden both collecting 46 percent of first-place votes, with Poliquin maintaining a slim edge of about 2,000 votes.\n\nThat would've meant a Poliquin victory under Maine's old voting system. But neither candidate secured a majority, triggering additional voting rounds.\n\nThe new system adopted by Maine voters in 2016 lets people rank candidates from first to last on the ballot. It provides for additional tabulations in which last-place candidates are eliminated and votes reallocated to ensure the winner gets a majority of the vote.\n\nU.S District Judge Lance Walker on Wednesday heard arguments from attorneys for Poliquin and three GOP activists who contended the system violates the U.S. Constitution.\n\nA day later, Walker declined to intervene to stop the process. But Poliquin's lawsuit remains alive because he didn't rule on the constitutionality of the system.\n\nIn his decision, the judge said it doesn't appear the Constitution prohibits an election process with more than one round of ballot counting. He also said it's plausible the Constitution allows states \"sufficient leeway to experiment with the election process.\"\n\n\"Moreover, for this court to change the rules of the election, after the votes have been cast, could well offend due process,\" he wrote.\n\nDemocrats saw an opportunity even though no incumbent had lost re-election in the sprawling 2nd Congressional District in a hundred years.\n\nGolden accused Poliquin of trying to take Mainers' access to affordable health care away, and pledged to create jobs and protect gun rights. Poliquin, meanwhile, dismissed his challenger as \"a young radical with a socialist agenda\" and touted his efforts to cut taxes and press for fair trade deals, saying they've contributed to economic growth.\n\nTwo independents, Tiffany Bond and Will Hoar, were also in the race. Together, they collected about 8 percent of the vote total.\n\nFor now, the ranked-choice voting system is used only in federal races and in statewide primary elections in Maine. It cannot be used in the governor's race or legislative races because of concerns it runs afoul of the state constitution.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Janet Mills has vowed to seek to amend the Maine's constitution so the system can be used in all elections."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Michelle Baumann", "title": "#DisneyKids: There\u2019s a Whole Lot of Cheer for Preschoolers at Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party", "description": "Christmastime at Disney is dreamy, radiant and downright magical.

The new FDA rules now require stores to sell flavored nicotine vape products in \"age-restricted\" areas. This means a store cannot allow anyone under the age of 18 to see or enter the area where those products are sold.\n\nThe limitations do not apply to non-flavored products and do not limit sales of mint, menthol or tobacco flavors.\n\nIn the same announcement, the FDA moved to ban menthol flavored cigarettes and flavored cigars.

It was the largest enforcement action of its kind in the agency\u2019s history.\n\nLast month, the FDA raided the San Francisco headquarters of Juul Labs, looking for documents related to the company's marketing practices.

The Trump administration has imposed a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods over complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of market access. That tariff had been due to rise to 25 percent in January. Another $50 billion of Chinese goods already is subject to 25 percent duties. Beijing has responded with penalty duties on $110 billion of American goods.

She persuaded a majority in her Cabinet to back an agreement that would allow Britain to stay in a customs union while a trade treaty is negotiated, but the deal faces an uncertain fate in Parliament and two of her Cabinet ministers, including the Brexit minister, resigned in protest.

Scott Gottlieb of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration disclose\u2026 [+341 chars]", "fulltext": "In a major new effort to curb smoking, a top U.S. health official pledged Thursday to try to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars and tighten rules governing the sale of most flavored versions of electronic cigarettes.\n\nThe proposed restrictions were aimed mainly at reducing smoking in kids: About half of teens who smoke cigarettes choose menthols, and flavored e-cigarettes have been blamed for a recent increase in teen vaping rates.\n\n\"I will not allow a generation of children to become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes,\" Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement.\n\nHealth advocates say a menthol ban would have greater impact on the health of Americans, but it would probably take years to put in place. The changes for e-cigarettes could kick in within a few months.\n\nBattery-powered e-cigarettes are more popular among teens than regular smokes and are considered safer. But many versions contain potentially addictive nicotine, and health officials believe they set kids who try them on a path toward regular cigarettes.\n\nGottlieb called for additional steps to prevent the marketing of e-cigarettes directly to kids and online sales to minors. He also proposed beefing up measures to ensure that convenience stores and some other retailers do not sell e-cigarettes in kid-friendly flavors such as cherry and vanilla. They could still be sold in vape shops or other businesses that do not admit minors.\n\nSmoking is the nation's leading cause of preventable illness, causing more than 480,000 deaths each year. The FDA currently bans sales of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to those under 18.\n\nIn 2009, the government banned a number of kid-friendly flavorings in cigarettes. But after an aggressive lobbying effort by tobacco companies, menthol was exempted.\n\nGottlieb's proposal for e-cigarette flavorings also exempts menthol. He said menthol e-cigarettes may be an option for adults who turn to vaping products to quit regular cigarettes, and he decided not to push for an end to menthol flavoring in vaping products.\n\nSmoking has been declining for more than five decades. Some 42 percent of U.S. adults smoked in the early 1960s. Last year, the rate was down to 14 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nExperts credit anti-smoking campaigns, cigarette taxes and smoking bans for most of the decline in the adult rate. But some say adult smokers switching to e-cigarettes have also helped in recent years.\n\nThe cigarette smoking rate is even lower among high school students \u2014 about 9 percent, according to the latest figures.\n\nBut e-cigarette use jumped 78 percent this year among U.S. high school kids and 48 percent among middle school kids, Gottlieb said. He cited a survey this past spring of more than 20,000 middle and high school students. About 21 percent of high schoolers said they had vaped recently, and 5 percent of middle schoolers said they had.\n\nSome experts attribute the jump to newer versions of e-cigarettes, like those by Juul Labs Inc. of San Francisco. These products resemble computer flash drives, can be recharged in USB ports and can be used discreetly.\n\n\"The increase in e-cigarette popularity (among kids) is almost certainly not a function of flavors. All the flavors were out there already,\" said Kenneth Warner, a University of Michigan emeritus public health professor who is a leading authority on smoking and health.\n\nThe FDA has taken earlier steps to investigate the marketing of e-cigarettes by Juul and other companies.\n\nGetting out ahead of the FDA announcement, Juul on Tuesday stopped filling store orders for mango, fruit, creme and cucumber pods and will resume sales only to retailers that scan IDs and take other steps to verify a buyer is at least 21. The company said Juul will continue to sell menthol and mint at stores, and sell all flavors through its website.\n\nHealth advocates generally applauded the e-cigarette plans, but some said they did not go far enough. Some called for a complete ban of flavorings, for example, and a more aggressive regulation of e-cigarettes that have come on the market in the last two years.\n\nThe proposed sales restrictions on e-cigarettes \"are a step forward, but by themselves are not enough to stem the youth e-cigarette epidemic,\" said Robin Koval, chief executive of the Truth Initiative, an advocacy group that runs anti-tobacco ads.\n\nGottlieb acknowledged that he could have taken more aggressive steps, \"but I don't want to foreclose opportunities for currently addicted adult smokers\" to access e-cigarettes as they try to quit regular smokes.\n\nHe also said he hopes e-cigarette companies work to restrict kids from buying their products. If current efforts do not succeed, he's willing to take more steps later, he said.\n\nMenthol cigarettes, which contain a minty compound that reduces the harshness of smoke and suppresses coughing, were widely marketed starting in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nRoughly a third of the cigarettes sold today are menthols, according to some estimates.\n\nThe e-cigarette measures will probably face little opposition, but Gottlieb \"has guts\" to pursue a menthol prohibition because it will draw political and legal fire from the tobacco industry and its supporters, Warner said.\n\nAn official with Altria Group Inc., one of the big tobacco companies, said a total ban on menthol cigarettes or flavored cigars \"would be an extreme measure not supported by the science and evidence.\"\n\nMurray Garnick, Altria's general counsel, said the company expects that establishing product standards on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars \"will be a multi-year, deliberative process.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Heil Trump!\" during intermission of a classic play set in a Jewish village in czarist Russia. The patron's outburst during a Wednesday night production of \"Fiddler on the Roof\" sent panicked people running for the exits.\n\nRich Scherr, a technology and financial journalist who was one of over 1,000 people attending the Wednesday night performance at Baltimore's Hippodrome Theatre, said a man seated in the balcony was behind the commotion. He described stunned audience members initially freezing in confusion and fear when the man began shouting minutes into the intermission.\n\n\"Everything just got really, really quiet. And then I heard this guy screaming: \"Heil Hitler! Heil Trump!\" he said in a Thursday phone interview. Other patrons told him they also heard the man yell about \"MAGA,\" President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.\n\nA few dozen people started running for the exits, according to Scherr, while others began calling out for security. Scherr said he braced for the possibility of gun violence in the packed theater. \"You don't want to think the worst, but I was preparing to react in case of gunfire,\" he said.\n\nIn a police report made public Thursday evening, hours after the story made waves, police said the man told officers he was actually motivated to shout out salutes to Hitler and Trump because of his disdain for the president. Officers said the man, identified as Anthony Derlunas, 58, told them he'd been \"drinking heavily throughout the night.\" Law enforcers found he was not a threat to public safety.\n\nThe theater scare comes a few weeks after a gunman fatally shot 11 people inside a Pittsburgh synagogue. The suspect in that shooting, Robert Bowers, 46, expressed hatred of Jews during the rampage and later told police that \"all these Jews need to die,\" authorities said. It also comes days after the FBI released a report showing a 17 percent spike in U.S. hate crimes in 2017 \u2014with a 37 percent increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes.\n\nIn a tweet, Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, responded to a Baltimore Sun article about the Wednesday night incident, describing it as \"yet another sign that these are not normal times.\"\n\nAfter several minutes, the offending theatergoer was escorted out of the Baltimore theater by security and the show continued without incident after the intermission ended. The Baltimore police said officers did respond to the Hippodrome at 9:40 p.m. Wednesday, but no arrest was made and the man was allowed to leave on his own.\n\n\"Though reprehensible, the man's words are considered protected free speech because he did not directly threaten anyone,\" said Matt Jablow, a spokesman for the Baltimore Police Department.\n\nWhatever the man's intentions, police will be posted at the Baltimore theater for performances through Sunday.\n\nThe Hippodrome Theatre said behavior \"like we saw during intermission\" at Wednesday evening's performance would not be tolerated. They said their security coordinated efforts with city police who met the man as he was escorted out of the building.\n\n\"Our venue has a proud tradition of providing shared experiences to people from all walks of life, right in the heart of this wonderfully diverse city, and we intend to continue that tradition in the spirit of bringing people together, not dividing them,\" the Hippodrome's Thursday statement said.\n\n\"Fiddler on the Roof\" is a bittersweet musical revolving around a poor Orthodox Jewish milkman, his rebellious daughters and other community members of a village in czarist Russia, and their faith that is tested by progress and repression. Set in 1905, it's based on stories originally written in Yiddish by Sholom Aleichem.\n\nThe original Broadway production in 1964 starred Zero Mostel and had an almost eight-year run, offering the world such enduring songs as \"Sunrise, Sunset,\" ''If I Were a Rich Man\" and \"Matchmaker, Matchmaker.\" It's long been a staple for schools and community theater groups.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow McFadden on Twitter: https://twitter.com/dmcfadd\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Italy's bishops respond to long-ignored clergy sex abuse", "description": "Italy's Catholic bishops are declaring a new era of transparency and truth about clergy sex abuse, as awareness of the scandal that has convulsed much of the world begins to take hold in a country where it was long ignored", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/italys-bishops-respond-long-clergy-sex-abuse-59216652", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:13:17Z", "content": "Italy's Catholic bishops are declaring a new era of transparency and truth about clergy sex abuse, as awareness of the scandal that has convulsed much of the world begins to take hold in a country where it was long ignored.

Their first guidelines, published in 2014, made clear bishops were under no obligation to report crimes to police.\n\nWhile the scandal hasn't yet erupted in Italy on the scale that it has elsewhere, there have been several high-profile cases of abuse and cover-up by bishops that show the Italian church is by no means immune to the problem.\n\nBassetti acknowledged that \"in the past\" the Italian church sought to avoid scandal at all cost by keeping cases quiet. But he said the Italian bishops, at their just-concluded national assembly, had made a \"radical, evangelical choice\" toward transparency.\n\n\"The Gospel says there shouldn't be scandals, but if there are scandals, it's better that they are exposed so that the truth can triumph,\" he told reporters. \"This calls us all to a great transparency.\"\n\nHe said the Italian church is updating its guidelines, but it's not clear to what extent the revised norms will address when bishops cover up abuse or are themselves accused of sexual misconduct, an issue that dominated the just-ended conference of U.S. bishops this week.\n\nPope Francis, who as bishop of Rome has a unique relationship with the Italian conference, has summoned bishops from around the world to a February summit on abuse prevention."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: News headlines today: Nov. 15, 2018", "description": "Catch up on the developing stories making headlines.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/news-headlines-today-nov-15-2018-59215977", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181115_vod_live_headlines_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:01:27Z", "content": "Now Playing: News headlines today: Nov. 14, 2018 Now Playing: News headlines today: Nov. 15, 2018 Now Playing: New York Times report alleges Facebook hired Republican operatives to squash protests Now Playing: New York City man revealed as $125M Powerball win\u2026 [+1121 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for News headlines today: Nov. 15, 2018\n\nSedan sold in California wildfires now stands at 59.

The 57-year-old New Zealand native dove in, making sure shelves were loaded with the most popular products and establishing controls to increase freshness in produce like strawberries.\n\nForan's obsession with the nitty-gritty details has helped lead to several years of straight quarterly sales gains for the U.S. division. But with Walmart facing competition from Amazon and other pressures, he's also reimagining the shopping experience at Walmart's 4,700 stores, transforming them into distribution hubs that can fill the fast-growing online orders to reduce shipping costs and speed up deliveries. To do that, Walmart has been training its 1.5 million workers at its new academies while using automation to relieve them of menial tasks.\n\nScanning robots at a store in Houston as well as a cluster of others keep tabs of what's on and not on the shelves and communicate that information to the automatic conveyor system that's backed up to the truck bay. Workers with new apps on their hand-held devices manage routine tasks like price changes on the spot, freeing them to serve shoppers and even check them out.\n\nForan, who used to head Walmart's China business, says he's always looking to new technology that improves efficiency. Still he takes delight in old-school retail basics like watching shoppers open a carton of produce.\n\nAP recently spoke with Foran during a tour of the Houston store about the holiday season, his views on workers and other issues. The questions and answers have been edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ. What makes this holiday season different?\n\nA. I wake up on Monday morning at 4 a.m. and the first email I look at is Amazon has gone and introduced free shipping. You're getting competitors out there starting to up the ante. I think we'll see more business done online, not just at Amazon but at Walmart and in other retailers. I think the fact that people like Toys R Us are out of the market has changed the environment around toys, both physical and digital offering.\n\nQ. So do you think you'll drop the $35 minimum order for free shipping for the holidays?\n\nA. These things are always discussed and reviewed. Sometimes that means following and other times it doesn't.\n\nQ. Does Amazon keep you up at night?\n\nA. To be frank, lots of things keep me up at night. Amazon is one of them. Target is another. I am in Aldi stores, Lidl stores. There's no doubt that Amazon is a significant competitor. You keep tabs. But your job is not to copy.\n\nQ. How are you approaching wages given increasing competitive pressures?\n\nA. We look at it regularly. As you can imagine, it's a particularly large country. We've made a lot of progress getting ourselves from where we were to $9, then $10, and then $11 earlier on this year. We've got a number of stores that pay well over that now, $12, $13, $14. So we continuously review that. We then take into account what we're doing in things like benefits so parental leave, PTO (paid time off) etc.\n\nQ. Will there be fewer workers at Walmart stores given robotic technology?\n\nA. That's going to play itself out. I am a big proponent of the good jobs strategy. For a lot of tasks that you used to do that were mundane, tedious, we're now working out how we can digitize those. And then we're creating new roles through turning stores into fulfillment centers because now we've got thousands of personal shoppers who are picking your order, so the jobs are changing.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: More than 90 murders could be tied to inmate, official says", "description": "Samuel Little, 78, is currently serving life behind bars for the killings of three women.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/90-murders-tied-inmate-official-59215803", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181115_wabc_serial_killer_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:50:59Z", "content": "Now Playing: More than 90 murders could be tied to inmate, official says Now Playing: News headlines today: Nov. 15, 2018 Now Playing: Wisconsin business gives every employee money to buy a gun Now Playing: Fast food manager attacked by woman over ketchup Now\u2026 [+1123 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for More than 90 murders could be tied to inmate, official says\n\nYou this morning investigators say a convicted killer in California could be connected to more than nine Indy.

Excluding gasoline sales, which were inflated by higher prices, sales climbed 0.5 percent.\n\nThe figures suggest that consumers are pulling back a bit on their spending, which is likely to slow growth in the final three months of the year. Americans had lifted their spending over the summer and fall at the fastest six-month pace in four years.

It is on track to lift the short-term rate it controls a fourth time this year at its December meeting.\n\nThe positive impact of the Trump administration's tax cuts, as well as a large spending package approved by Congress this spring, will likely fade over the next year, Powell said.\n\nSome of October's spending gain was likely boosted by the impact of Hurricane Florence in September and Hurricane Michael last month. The government said it could not measure the precise impact of the two storms. But auto sales rose 1.1 percent in October, the most since March, as many Americans may have replaced cars destroyed by the hurricanes.\n\nHome improvement and garden store sales increased 1 percent, the most since May, likely boosted by storm-related home repairs and preparations. On Tuesday, Home Depot breezed past all expectations for its most recent quarter and raised its annual profit expectations.\n\nGasoline station sales jumped 3.5 percent, the most in almost a year, largely because of rising prices at the pump. Yet prices have since declined and will likely continue to do so, as oil prices have fallen sharply this week. The average cost of a gallon of gas was $2.67 on Thursday, down from $2.89 a month earlier.\n\nNearly all types of retailers reported strong sales gains, a sign of consumer health. Clothing store sales rose 0.5 percent and sales at general merchandise stores, which include big box retailers such as Walmart and Target, also increased 0.5 percent.

Penney withdrew its profit guidance and lowered its sales expectations for the year, leading to a big drop in its stock in early trading before shares recovered.\n\nSales at stores open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer's health, declined 5.4 percent during the third quarter. That was much worse than the analysts' prediction of a 0.5 percent decline, according to FactSet. J.C. Penney's poor performance is an outlier at a time when the strong economy is helping retailers from Walmart to Home Depot. Many are also benefiting from struggling peers like Sears or Bon-Ton who are either fading or going out of business. They're heavily investing in online services and bolstering their merchandise assortment. Instead, Penney has been floundering, weighed down by debt that limits how much it can aggressively reinvent its operations.\n\nJ.C. Penney said Thursday it withdrew guidance because its new CEO and interim CFO need more time to look over operations. The poor performance underscores big challenges for Jill Soltau, the former Jo-Ann's Stores CEO who was named to Penney's top post last month. Soltau succeeded Marvin Ellison, who left this past summer after less than four years to take the top job at home improvement chain Lowe's. In October, Penney appointed Michael Fung as interim CFO. He succeeded Jerry Murray, who remains senior vice president of finance.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts, Soltau said she would be assessing many areas from promotions to merchandise strategies in the store and online.\n\n\"While this will be a lengthy process, I understand the need for quick action,\" she said.\n\nThe department store has been trying to turn things around, bringing back big appliances like washing machines, adding year-round toy shops and improving its e-commerce operations. That has yet to show a substantial effect.\n\n\"The first and most pressing task for Jill Soltau is to get J.C. Penney back to thinking in a customer-centric way,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \"For far too long the company has undertaken random initiatives with seemingly no consideration of who the core customer is or what they want. With an incredibly tight balance sheet, JCP can no longer afford to squander resources.\"\n\nSaunders called the drop in sales at established stores \"poor.\"\n\n\"To do it at a time when consumer confidence and spending are at their peak is nothing short of atrocious,\" he added.\n\nFor the third quarter ended Nov. 3, the Plano, Texas, company posted a loss of $151 million, or 48 cents per share. A year earlier it lost $125 million, or 40 cents per share. The adjusted loss of 52 cents per share was a nickel better than analysts had expected. However, revenue of $2.73 billion fell short of Wall Street expectations of $2.81 billion.\n\nThe department store now foresees sales at stores open at least a year to be down low-single digits for fiscal 2018. Analysts had expected a 0.2 percent drop.\n\nShares of J.C.

Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nU.S. District Chief Judge Mark Walker has granted a preliminary injunction, sought by Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, ordering Florida\u2019s secretary of state to direct local supervisors of elections that they must allow voters with suspected mismatched signatures to \"cure\" -- or validate -- their vote-by-mail and provisional ballots by 5 p.m. Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe precise issue in this case is whether Florida\u2019s law that allows county election officials to reject vote-by-mail and provisional ballots for mismatched signatures \u2014 with no standards, an illusory process to cure, and no process to challenge the rejection \u2014 passes constitutional muster. The answer is simple. It does not,\u201d Walker wrote in the order.\n\nThe court ruling is not an order for county canvassing boards to \"count every mismatched vote, sight unseen,\" Walker wrote, but instead is an order to \"allow those voters who should have had an opportunity to cure their ballots in the first place to cure their vote-by-mail and provisional ballots now, before the second official results are fully counted.\"\n\nVote-by-mail and provisional ballots have become increasingly popular, Walker said, but the county canvassing boards, which determine whether a voter's signature on vote-by-mail and provisional ballots match state records, are \"staffed by laypersons that are not required to undergo formal handwriting-analysis education or training.\"\n\nNevertheless, ballots considered to have \"mismatched signatures\" are rejected as invalid votes. Voters who are notified before Election Day of this discrepancy on their ballot can attempt to \"cure,\" or address the problem, but the judge ruled that under previous law, the window to do so was too narrow, and in some cases, nonexistent.\n\nIf this \"last chance\" to cure is denied, \"Florida law provides no opportunity for voters to challenge the determination of the canvassing board that their signatures do not match, and their votes do not count,\" Walker ruled.\n\nFor provisional ballots, the other type of ballot under inspection by the lawsuit, there was neither a cure period or a mechanism for a voter to challenge the decision that the voter wasn't eligible to vote.\n\n\"Consider the game of football,\" Walker wrote. Rules are made and rules are followed, he said, but sometimes calls deserve reviews.\n\n\"Indeed, not every call is going to be clear \u2014 the ultimate decision may hinge on highly subjective factors. Hence, a call will be overturned only when there is 'clear and obvious visual evidence available that warrants the change',\" Walker wrote, citing 2018 NFL rules.\n\n\"In this case, the Plaintiffs have thrown a red flag. But this is not football. Rather, this is a case about the precious and fundamental right to vote \u2014 the right preservative of all other rights,\" Walker wrote.\n\nLike the game of football, elections are governed by their own set of laws that allow for an \"efficient and transparent\" process.\n\nAnd, as in football, Walker wrote, \"There is no doubt that election officials must make certain calls, under the rules, that deserve review. And there is no doubt some of those calls may hinge on highly subjective factors.\"\n\nRepublican Gov. Rick Scott, running against Nelson in the tight race for Florida's Senate seat, filed an immediate appeal of the ruling, which his campaign's press secretary called \"baseless.\"\n\nThere are at least 3,688 vote-by-mail ballots and 93 provisional ballots, from 45 of 67 counties reporting, that were rejected by counties for a signature mismatch. That number that does not include questioned ballots from bigger counties, including Duval and Miami-Dade. How much of an impact the questioned ballots would have depends, on how many voters correct signature issues by Saturday. Scott currently leads Nelson by 12,562 votes.\n\nThe deadline for Florida counties to finish their machine recounts in Nelson's Senate race against Scott, as well as in the governor's race pitting former Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis against Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a Democrat, is 3 p.m. Thursday.\n\nBefore that deadline, however, court action is expected on Nelson's lawsuit in federal court seeking to nullify all deadlines and give counties as much time to count votes as is needed, which, if ruled in Nelson's favor, would erase the need for counties to hit the 3 p.m. deadline.\n\nABC News' Stephanie Wash and Ahmad Hemingway contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Jewelry auction sets world record for royal collection", "description": "A royal treasure trove including jewels that belonged to French Queen Marie Antoinette fetches over $53 million, setting a world record for a royal collection, Sotheby's auction house says.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/jewelry-auction-sets-world-record-royal-collection-59214402", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/181115_abc_social_royal_jewelry_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:16:24Z", "content": "Now Playing: Jewelry auction sets world record for royal collection Now Playing: Book to reveal new details about Thai boys' harrowing rescue from cave Now Playing: Israel &amp; Gaza at a cease-fire Now Playing: Brexit Deal Now Playing: Celebrating Prince Cha\u2026 [+985 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Jewelry auction sets world record for royal collection\n\nAnd we're.

Pigs that never reach puberty.\n\nA company wants to alter farm animals by adding and subtracting genetic traits in a lab. It sounds like science fiction, but Recombinetics sees opportunity for its technology in the livestock industry.\n\nBut first, it needs to convince regulators that gene-edited animals are no different than conventionally bred ones. To make the technology appealing and to ease any fears that it may be creating Franken-animals, Recombinetics isn't starting with productivity. Instead, it's introducing gene-edited traits as a way to ease animal suffering.\n\n\"It's a better story to tell,\" said Tammy Lee, CEO of the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company.\n\nFor instance, animal welfare advocates have long criticized the way farmers use caustic paste or hot irons to dehorn dairy cows so the animals don't harm each other. Recombinetics snips out the gene for growing horns so the procedure is unnecessary.\n\nLast year, a bull gene-edited by Recombinetics to have the dominant hornless trait sired several offspring. All were born hornless as expected, and are being raised at the University of California, Davis. Once the female offspring starts lactating, its milk will be tested for any abnormalities.\n\nAnother Recombinetics project: castration-free pigs.\n\nWhen male piglets go through puberty, their meat can take on an unpleasant odor, something known as \"boar taint.\" To combat it, farmers castrate pigs, a procedure animal welfare advocates say is commonly performed without painkillers. Editing genes so that pigs never go through puberty would make castration unnecessary.\n\nAlso in development are dairy cows that could withstand higher temperatures, so the animals don't suffer in hotter climates.\n\nRecombinetics and others say gene-editing techniques do what traditional breeding has always done, except much faster and with the precision of \"molecular scissors.\" They are waiting for clarity from government officials , but say meat and milk from gene-edited animals shouldn't be subject to special regulations.\n\nMost U.S. dairy cows already are bred through artificial insemination from \"semen straws,\" which are priced for a bull's pedigree and traits developed through years of traditional breeding. Gene-edited traits would just be higher-priced extras, Recombinetics says. For example, the hornless trait could add $3 to $5 to the price of a semen straw that could cost around $15.\n\nOnce gene-editing is accepted by the public, farmers will be more interested in traits that step up productivity, Lee predicted. As an example, she cited pigs edited to have bigger litters.\n\nCHICKENS AS BIG AS ELEPHANT?\n\nBefore food from gene-edited animals can land on dinner tables, however, Recombinetics has to overcome any public unease about the technology.\n\nBeyond worries about \"playing God,\" it may be an uncomfortable reminder of how modern food production already treats animals, said Paul Thompson, a professor of agriculture at Michigan State University.\n\n\"There's an ethical question that's been debated for at least the last 20 years, of whether you need to change the animal or change the system,\" Thompson said.\n\nSupport for gene editing will also likely depend on how the technology is used: whether it's for animal welfare, productivity or disease resistance. In August, a Pew study found 43 percent of Americans supported genetically engineered animals for more nutritious meat.\n\nThe array of possibilities is why the Humane Society of the United States supports gene-editing to end pig castrations and cow dehorning but doesn't give the technology its blanket approval.\n\n\"If you edit for your chicken to be the size of an elephant, that's not good,\" said Josh Balk, the group's vice president of farm animal protection.\n\nThe image seems preposterous, but it may not be far off from what the words \"gene-edited animals\" conjure for many. In the science-fiction movie \"Rampage\" earlier this year, gene-editing is used to create monsters, including a giant wolf that shoots porcupine spikes from its tail.\n\nSome may also question the need to risk using the technology, if it really just speeds up what could be achieved with conventional breeding.\n\nAdvances in traditional breeding have already stepped up the productivity of cows, chickens and pigs. Today, milk producers can shop for characteristics developed through conventional breeding, like body frames and how efficiently animals convert feed into meat. Semex, a Canadian seller of bull semen, offers already offers a \" Robot Ready \" option for cows \"built for automation,\" with teat lengths and temperaments bred for milking machines.\n\nThe company is working with Recombinetics to develop the gene-edited hornless trait.\n\nNotably, hornless dairy cows also already exist. But Recombinetics says there are so few that breeding them would compromise the valuable traits that have been carefully bred into modern dairy cows.\n\nBut John Burket, who breeds hornless dairy cows in Pennsylvania, thinks the hornless trait could spread quickly if it was prioritized.\n\nBurket isn't opposed to gene-editing, but he said he's waiting to see if the technology delivers.\n\n\"ROBOT READY\" COWS\n\nFor now, a more practical challenge for Recombinetics will be coming up with gene-edited traits farmers are willing to pay for. Semex says it will take at least two years of testing before it can start selling the hornless trait for dairy cows.\n\nConventional breeding comes with a lot more chance, but advances over the years have nevertheless made dairy farms increasingly productive. Paradoxically, that has contributed to a glut of milk, driving down prices and pressuring farmers.\n\nRecombinetics says improving productivity isn't just about producing more milk or meat but targeting inefficiencies like dehorning and pig castrations. Still, Lorraine Lewandrowski, a dairy farmer in upstate New York, is reminded of the skepticism she felt with bovine growth hormone in the 1990s.\n\n\"Do we want another technology that will put even more milk on the market?\" she said.\n\nLewandrowski is also wary of anything that might give the dairy industry a bad image. But she noted the gene-edited hornless trait could save the time spent on dehorning.\n\nJonathan Lamb, an owner of Oakfield Dairy in western New York, said he wouldn't pay much extra for the hornless trait; he's watching costs because of low milk prices. But he thinks gene-editing could offer other improvements.\n\n\"I see that as a first step to other possibilities,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Candice Choi at @candicechoi\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

It has come under heavy airstrikes several times that have demolished many of the area's ancient buildings.\n\nIn many cases, Houthis turned some of the archaeological sites into army barracks, resulting in the Saudi-led coalition striking the sites, causing heavy damage to the ancient monuments.\n\nOn other occasions, extremist groups operating in the country blew up churches, temples and ancient Sufi shrines, exploiting the state of lawlessness and the breakdown of order in the country after years of the war.\n\nThe Mawatana organization accused all parties to the conflict of having \"a hostile attitude toward history.\" It urged the international community to take responsibility for the protection of the cultural heritage of Yemen saying that parties are acting with impunity because of a lack of accountability. It added there is a need to place archaeological sites and monuments on an \"enhanced protection\" list adopted by the 1999 Hague Convention to prevent attacks against them and protect them from being used as military barracks or sites.\n\nThe report also points to the war's impact on the massive Marib dam, which is nearly 3,000 years old and one of the world's oldest. Built of stone cut from the mountains, Yemenis take pride in the dam because it is a symbol of their ancient civilization. The northern gate of the dam was struck in May 2015 by coalition forces as Houthis took positions near the site.\n\nBaraqish was a religious and commercial hub in the 5th century B.C. It features prominent temples and was a center for Yemen's famed frankincense trade. Houthis took control of the site in mid-August 2015. Mawatana quoted witnesses as saying they turned the site into a place for weapons caches, causing the coalition to target it more than once. The Houthis also booby-trapped the sites, according to the report.\n\nKnown as the Manhattan of the Desert, the ancient site of Shibam in the southern governorate of Hadramawt sustained damage after Islamic State insurgents rammed a bomb-laden car through a checkpoint outside the city and the explosions caused damage to some of the buildings.\n\nOther sites mentioned in the report include the fortress at Kawkaban, the al-Hadi mosque in Saada and the military museum in Aden. Two Taiz landmarks \u2014 the al-Sudi and al-Rumaymeh domes \u2014 were totally destroyed by extremist groups, according to the report. In Dar al-Hajar palace in Lahj, Houthi rebels used artillery and tanks to shell the sites, causing extensive damage."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "The Latest: Turkey slams Saudi indictments on Khashoggi", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The sanctions were announced Thursday. One of the men is a top aide to Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman.\n\nU.S. officials say they have pressed the Saudi government for a full investigation into the killing of Khashoggi. Turkish and Saudi authorities say the U.S.-based columnist for The Washington Post was killed by a team from the kingdom inside the consulate after he went there to get marriage documents.\n\nSaudi authorities have 21 people in custody and the country's top prosecutor said he would seek the death penalty for five of the suspects.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n6:10 p.m.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Foreign Minister says that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had \"absolutely\" nothing to do with the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"Absolutely, his royal highness the crown prince has nothing to do with this issue,\" Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in a press conference in Riyadh.\n\nHe spoke just hours after Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor said he was seeking the death penalty for five men who exceeded their authority and carried out the killing.\n\nAl-Jubeir said the kingdom is investigating and holding those responsible to account \"to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\n\n\"Sometimes mistakes happen... sometimes people exceed their authority,\" he said, adding that the kingdom is now focused on ensuring such an operation does not happen again.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n4:20 p.m.\n\nTurkey's foreign minister says the announcement by Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor on recommending the death penalty for five suspects in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi falls short of Turkey's expectations.\n\nMevlut Cavusoglu also insists that the suspects detained in Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's killing should be put on trial in Turkey. He says Ankara wants Riyadh to reveal who ordered the Oct. 2 killing of the journalist at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nCavusoglu says: \"I want to say that we did not find some of his explanations to be satisfactory\" and that \"those who gave the order, the real perpetrators need to be revealed. This process cannot be closed down in this way.\"\n\nThe minister also questioned why Saudi Arabia indicted only 11 out of 18 detained suspects.

The company on Thursday posted third-quarter earnings of $1.71 billion, or 58 cen\u2026 [+570 chars]", "fulltext": "Walmart may be bruised by Amazon, but it's learning how to fight back.\n\nThe world's largest retailer delivered strong third-quarter results Thursday, extending a streak of sales growth into its 11th straight quarter that was helped by services such as online grocery pickup. It also raised profit expectations for the year heading into the holiday shopping season.\n\nLike other retailers, Walmart is benefiting from a strong job market and rising consumer confidence. But retailers are also benefiting from the misfortunes of others. Toys R Us and Bon-Ton Stores have gone out of business, while the Sears bankruptcy is creating more opportunities to grab sales. J.C. Penney, still floundering, on Thursday withdrew profit guidance and lowered its sales expectations for the year.\n\nWalmart posted strong sales across a wide range of products from toys and back-to-school items to fresh food. That helped sales at stores open at least a year rise 3.4 percent, a bit slower from the previous quarter's 4.5 percent at Walmart's U.S. division, which marked its best performance in more than a decade. The measure, an indicator of a retailer's health, was helped by a 1.2 percent increase in customer traffic and a 2.2 percent increase in transactions.\n\nSince buying Jet.com two years ago, Walmart has been expanding online by acquiring brands and adding thousands of items. It's also been ramping up grocery delivery and pickup options. Grocery pickup is now offered at nearly 2,100 of its 4,700 U.S. stores, while grocery delivery is available in nearly 600 locations. Walmart has also revamped its website with a focus on fashion and home furnishings. That all helped to drive a 43 percent increase in online sales in the U.S. during the latest quarter. That was up from a 40 percent increase in the second quarter and a 33 percent increase in the first quarter.\n\nStill, Walmart's online sales remain a fraction of Amazon's online global merchandise empire, which hit $108 billion last year. Walmart's U.S. online business was a mere $11.5 billion.\n\nA visit to a Walmart store in Houston last week showed generous holiday merchandise offerings such as expanded toy aisles with large interactive toy ponies and Barbie dream campers, each selling for nearly $400. Shoes are now unboxed and hang on racks to make it easier for shoppers to find them.\n\n\"We're feeling confident going into this holiday season,\" said Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran during an exclusive interview and tour last week at the Houston store. \"I think the standards, the flow of merchandise, our pricing are feeling better than it was a year ago.\"\n\nWalmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, is promising more to come. Under Foran, Walmart is creating a tech-powered shopping experience, while transforming its stores into efficient distribution hubs that can fill online orders to reduce shipping costs and speed up deliveries. To do that, Walmart is doing more extensive training for workers who are taking on new roles or redefined responsibilities while using scanning robots and other automation.\n\nWalmart is deploying giant pickup towers that spit out online orders in hundreds of its stores. Customers can now also better find items in the store because of digital maps on their smartphone. Workers, armed with new apps on their mobile devices, are also able to manage routine tasks, freeing them to serve the customer or check them out in key areas of the store.\n\n\"We can provide a much better customer experience because we are in stock of the right item, at the right time and at the same time it is going to help us be much more precise,\" he added.\n\nStill, Foran acknowledges it's facing stiffer competition from Amazon as well as other traditional chains like Target. Consulting firm Bain & Co. predicts that Amazon in the U.S. will outgrow the market and capture up to half of all e-commerce sales by the end of the year.\n\nIn fact, in the free shipping arena, Foran told The AP said that it's reviewing its current policy that has a $35 threshold for free shipping for the holidays after Target and Amazon both got rid of the minimum orders for free holiday shipping.\n\nAmazon is also expanding its cashier-less physical stores, pushing Walmart and others to speed up checkout, a source of frustration for many shoppers. In time for the holidays, Walmart has rolled out a program that allows its staff to check out customers and provide receipts right on the spot in the busiest sections of the store. Foran told The Associated Press it's taking another look at offering Scan & Go. That service allowed shoppers to scan items while they shop with their own personal device or a Walmart device and walk out. But it had been shelved twice after customers found it too clunky.\n\nBut the first big test this holiday season is Black Friday.\n\n\"It's a proxy for stores. If you run good stores, people will want to go to them,\" said Foran, who will be on a plane from 2 p.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving visiting stores and monitoring the sales.\n\nThe company posted third-quarter earnings of $1.71 billion, or 58 cents per share. Adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share, which is 6 cents better than expected.\n\nThe world's largest retailer reported revenue of $124.89 billion, about in line with forecasts.\n\nWalmart Inc. says it now expects full-year earnings of $4.75 to $4.85 per share.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Anne D'Innocenzio on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio\n\nPortions of this story were generated by Automated Insights ( http://automatedinsights.com/ap ) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

It has highlighted political leaders directly questioning -- and often without evidence -- whether election outcomes are even legitimate.\n\nRepublican leaders have been driving baseless claims about voter fraud and the potential to \"steal\" elections in Florida.\n\n\"Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again,\" Trump told The Daily Caller.\n\nMost of the claims have no evidence behind them, and are probably irrelevant because -- with the machine-recount deadline coming at 3 p.m. Thursday -- GOP candidates are likely to prevail in both the governor\u2019s and Senate races in Florida, anyway.\n\nThen there\u2019s Sen.

Add Jamal Khashoggi as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Jamal Khashoggi news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nSaudi Arabia will seek the death penalty against five men suspected of killing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its top prosecutor said Thursday, while the U.S. slapped sanctions on 17 Saudi officials in the toughest action it has taken against the kingdom since the slaying.\n\nThe Saudi moves failed to appease Turkey, which has put increasing pressure on its regional rival since Khashoggi was killed in Istanbul last month, but they could be enough for some of Saudi Arabia's Western allies to move on and press for key demands, such as an end to the war in Yemen.\n\nThe prosecutor's announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi's death and distance the killers and their operation from the kingdom's leadership, primarily Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Officials and analysts say an operation of this kind could not have happened without the prince's knowledge.\n\nPressed by Western journalists in Riyadh on Thursday, Saudi Arabia's top diplomat said the crown prince had \"absolutely\" nothing to do with the slaying of The Washington Post columnist, who was sharply critical of the heir to the throne.\n\nThe Saudi investigation pointed the finger at some members of the crown prince's inner circle but stopped short of accusing them of ordering the writer's death. Those closest to the prince are instead accused of ordering Khashoggi's forced return in an operation at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul that the Saudis allege went awry.\n\nIn a news conference, Sheikh Shalan al-Shalan, the deputy attorney general, said the killing was ordered by an individual whom he did not identify but said was responsible for negotiating Khashoggi's return back to Saudi Arabia from Turkey. The individual was part of a 15-man team that was made up of negotiators, intelligence officers and logistics officials.\n\nThat team was formed by Saud al-Qahtani, who was one of the crown prince's closest aides, and former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Assiri, the prosecutor said. Both men were close to the crown prince and fired from their posts after the killing.\n\nThey deemed Khashoggi's presence abroad as \"a threat to national security,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nKhashoggi had gone for a scheduled visit to the consulate on Oct. 2 to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage while his Turkish fianc\u00e9e waited outside.\n\nAl-Shalan said that on that morning, the leader of the negotiating team that confronted Khashoggi inside the consulate saw that he would not be able to force him to return, \"so he decided to kill him in the moment.\"\n\nThis appears to contradict a previous Saudi statement quoting Turkish intelligence as saying the killing had been premeditated \u2014 one of several shifting narratives about the case that have come from the kingdom.\n\nThe Saudi investigators stopped short of accusing al-Assiri or al-Qahtani of ordering Khashoggi's killing, bolstering previous Saudi assertions it was carried out by rogue agents who overstepped their authority.\n\nThe prosecutor said the agents sent in Istanbul drugged and killed the writer in the consulate before dismembering the body and giving it to an unidentified local collaborator for disposal. The body has not been found.\n\nChief prosecutor Saud Al-Mojeb said that of the 21 people in custody, 11 have been indicted and referred to trial, adding that he would seek the death penalty against five of the suspects. It's not unusual for a Saudi prosecutor to seek the death penalty before a trial.\n\nIn Washington, the U.S. Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials whom it said were responsible for or complicit in the killing. Among those targeted for sanctions were al-Qahtani and Mohammed al-Otaibi, the diplomat in charge of the consulate. Also named was Maher Mutreb, who was part of the crown prince's entourage on trips abroad.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets the 17 may have in the U.S. and prohibit any Americans from doing business with them.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, appearing at a news conference after the prosecutor spoke, told reporters the crown prince had nothing to do with the killing.\n\nAl-Jubeir said the kingdom is investigating and holding those responsible to account \"to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\n\n\"Sometimes mistakes happen ... sometimes people exceed their authority,\" he said.\n\nAmid the international outrage over the killing, Saudi Arabia has faced increased calls from the West to end the war in Yemen, which the crown prince launched as defense minister with other Arab countries in March 2015.\n\nSimon Henderson, who has written extensively on the crown prince for The Washington Institute, said that despite the horrific killing, the West still must deal with Saudi Arabia because of its strategic position in terms of oil exports and the crucial role that plays in the stability of the world economy.\n\n\"If it's the case that MBS is still the present and the future for Saudi Arabia, which I think it is, we have to maintain a working relationship with him,\" Henderson said, referring to the crown prince by his initials.\n\nSome Saudi allies appear ready to accept the narrative put forth by the kingdom in the absence of any \"smoking gun\" directly linking the crown prince to the murder, said H.A. Hellyer, an expert with the Atlantic Council.\n\n\"It's all about plausible deniability. If you can have plausible deniability, then I think a lot of Riyadh's partners will go for it,\" Hellyer said.\n\nThe latest Saudi account, however, did little to satisfy Turkish officials, who insist the killing and its cover-up were carried out by the highest levels of government. Through a series of orchestrated leaks, including audio of the killing shared with Western intelligence, Turkey has tried to keep pressure on the crown prince.\n\n\"Those who gave the order, the real perpetrators need to be revealed. This process cannot be closed down in this way,\" Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Iranian report: 5 abducted border guards freed in Pakistan", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The Kremlin dismisses Navalny as a trouble-maker with no political backing.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nRussia is awaiting a European court ruling on whether it violated the rights of opposition leader Alexei Navalny when arresting him on repeated occasions.\n\nA leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Navalny is expected to appear at the European Court of Human Rights in the French city of Strasbourg to hear the ruling Thursday, after a last-minute legal problem delayed his arrival.\n\nThe court ruled last year that seven of his arrests were unlawful and ordered Russia to pay 63,000 euros ($67,000) in compensation. But the court didn't rule on Navalny's arguments that the arrests were politically motivated.\n\nThe Russian government and Navalny appealed, and the case went to the court's Grand Chamber, which issues its final, binding ruling later Thursday."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Kelly Terez and Treavor Hastings", "title": "'Start Here': Nancy Pelosi, Avenatti's arrest and Brexit.

Pelosi fends off rebellion from Democrat defectors\n\nCongress is back in session and Nancy Pelosi is lobbying House Democrats to back her for speaker, including trying to win over several incoming freshmen who opposed her on the campaign trail.\n\nShe faces a rebellion from some in the party who are calling for new leadership and claim there will be enough votes to block her from winning the gavel on the House floor in January.\n\n\"There's a small, but determined group of Democrats in the House who want to see her sidelined,\" ABC News' Ben Siegel tells us.\n\nPelosi and her allies are confident that she will be speaker.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Republicans selected House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to serve as minority leader in the next Congress, but the GOP is coming to terms with a new reality, according to ABC News Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce: \"They're going to have to figure out how they're going to tackle this divided government because of course so far they've been in charge here.\"\n\n2. Lawsuits seek to extend Florida recount deadline\n\nThe deadline for Florida election officials to hand in machine recount totals in the races for governor, senator and agriculture commissioner is Thursday.\n\nBut Florida's recount deadlines are being challenged by incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in a lawsuit, and court action could change them. As of Wednesday night, the ongoing machine recount of votes still had to be completed by 3 p.m. Thursday.\n\nRepublican Gov. Rick Scott leads Nelson in the Senate race by 0.15 percentage points. Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis leads Democratic Mayor Andrew Gillum in the governor\u2019s race by 0.41 percentage points. A manual recount is forced when the margin falls within 0.25 percentage points, so a second recount in the gubernatorial race is less likely.\n\nIt's unclear if the recount totals will be done in time, according to ABC News' Chris Good, who covers election security, and he also notes that some ballots are still being counted.\n\n\"One thing to keep an eye on: There are a couple of Democratic lawsuits out there seeking to expand the number of votes that could get counted,\" Good says. \"There's a lawsuit that would, if successful, mean that ballots that were postmarked in time, but not delivered on time, would get counted.\"\n\nJoe Skipper/Getty Images\n\n3.

Judge to rule on CNN lawsuit against White House\n\nA federal judge will decide Thursday whether to force the White House to reinstate the press credentials of CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta.\n\nCNN and Acosta filed suit against President Donald Trump, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, the president's Chief of Staff John Kelly and the U.S. Secret Service, among others, over the suspension of the reporter\u2019s press pass following a heated exchange between Acosta and the president last week.\n\nThe cable network alleges the move was a violation of the First Amendment and \u201cthe culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta.\u201d An attorney for the Justice Department argued the president has the \u201cauthority\u201d to exclude journalists from White House grounds.\n\nDoes CNN have a case here?

The work was previously owned by billionaire record exec David Geffen, who sold it to a private collector in 1995.\n\nCourtesy Christies\n\nThe Post-War and Contemporary Art lot also included a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting, \"Discography Two,\" that sold for $20.9 million, and an untitled Mark Rothko work that sold for $35.7 million. In total, the lot brought in over $357 million.\n\nAlex Rotter, co-chairman of post-war and contemporary art at Christie's, described Hockney's acrylic painting as \"one of the great masterpieces of the modern era.\"\n\n\"David Hockney\u2019s brilliance as an artist is on full display with this monumental canvas, which encapsulates the essence of the idealized poolside landscape, and the tremendous complexity that exists within human relationships,\" Rotter said in a statement. \"With this painting, Hockney cemented his placement within the realm of history\u2019s most venerated artists, and come November, it is poised to become the most valuable work of art by a living artist ever sold at auction.\"\n\nVictoria Jones/Reuters\n\nHockney, who is revered as one of Great Britain's most influential artists and a pioneer of the 1960s pop art movement, conceived the composition for the double portrait by chance, after seeing the juxtaposition of two photographs on the floor of his studio in London -- one of a figure swimming underwater in a pool and the other of a boy staring at something on the ground.\n\nHe began painting in October 1971, but abandoned the first version of the canvas months later amid the end of his five-year relationship with Peter Schlesinger, a much younger American artist who was Hockney's original muse for the standing figure, according to Christie's.\n\nHockney, 81, started over in early April 1972, hoping to finish the piece for a planned exhibition in New York City the following month. He traveled to English filmmaker Tony Richardson's villa in the South of France, Le Nid du Duc, which became the backdrop for a number of Hockney's works.\n\nThere, he took hundreds of photographs of the villa's pool and breathtaking view in preparation for the painting, using his studio assistant as a stand-in for Schlesinger and a young photographer as the swimmer, according to Christie's.\n\nTimothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpon returning to London with the images, which soon covered the walls of his studio, Hockney worked on the painting 18 hours a day for two weeks straight, completing the piece the night before it was to be shipped to the United States, according to Christie's.\n\nThe painting is lauded as a culmination of two of Hockney's most iconic motifs: a pool and a double portrait. The privately owned work went under the hammer at Christie's auction house in New York City on Thursday night."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Fighting eases in Yemen but no official cease-fire in place", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Shortly afterward, Christiansen, the interim chief at the time, issued a mandatory full-day training about harassment and safety in the workplace.\n\nReed testified she left Grand Canyon National Park and transferred to the Park Service to get away from the supervisors and managers who \"harassed me, and assaulted me, and then retaliated against me when I reported it.\"\n\n\"Little did I know that transferring from the Park Service to the Forest Service was jumping from the frying pan into the fire,\" she said.\n\nReed told the committee an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor filed a report on her behalf to attempt to address the harassment. Afterward, she said, she got a fully successful performance rating but her supervisor, Jack Triepke, yelled at her and threatened to fire her. She filed another complaint, which resulted in Harassment Assessment Review Team intervention. Both inquiries found Reed's claims were \"unsubstantiated\" although there were witnesses to the incidents, Reed said.\n\nAfter further complaints and investigation, Reed was suspended for seven days and \"received a marginal rating at mid-year.\"\n\nYears of glowing reports preceded that one, including comments on Reed's \"commitment to achieving the agency's missions and goals,\" Reed's 2018 review from her supervisor was far from positive. She was instructed to \"be working at your desk at all times with the exceptions of short trips to the restroom,\" according to documents read by the committee.\n\n\"There were no consequences for my superiors,\" Reed said Thursday. \"It was just me. I just got the consequences.\"\n\nOne hundred current and former female employees of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, wrote an open letter Wednesday to Christiansen, echoing Reed's fear of retaliation and to \"expose serious issues of discrimination, harassment, and workplace violence against female employees.\"\n\nIn her testimony, Christiansen said the agency knows of the work they have to do going forward.\n\n\"We know that we have big work to do about the fear of retaliation, people are not coming forward. I cannot be any more clear than that,\" she said.\n\nChristiansen said it would take an overhaul of the department's culture to change the environment of the organization. She said like other large groups, there are people that are not doing the right thing and who don't respect each other.\n\n\"I would like to say I can change it in six months, but to be absolutely honest, I don't think you can change a culture of an organization...that has 40,000 employees,\" Christiansen said. \"It has to be a whole system of improvement. I don't think it's ever going to be totally done. You can be good and still not good enough.\"\n\nRep. Michelle Lujan Grisham fired at Christiansen, citing multiple incidents where department members were dishonest with their supervisors and in reporting misconduct.\n\n\"Our expectation is going to be that you are going to resolve this. Until you stand up and say, 'Every tool at my disposal, I will have a zero-tolerance policy' your culture will not change and people will not come forward because they are trapped in an environment where they will be immediately punished and bullied by their co-workers,\" Lujan Grisham of New Mexico said.\n\nThe women who signed the letter work in a variety of departments within the agency ranging in years of service from as little as three years to more than 25 years. They are all from different backgrounds, races, ethnicities and live across the country.\n\nThe Nov. 9 letter is not the first time women working in the agency have complained about abuse.\n\nAlex Milan Tracy/Sipa via AP, FILE\n\nIn the letter, the women wrote that the USDA and its agencies have a history of overlooked reports of sexual harassment and misconduct allegations. They stated that senior officers of the USDA Coalition of Minority Employees \"wrote letters to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Forest Service Chiefs describing incidents of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation against female employees in the Forest Service.\"\n\n\"Despite the concerns of Congress and the public exposure, the USDA and the Forest Service continue to ignore our complaints and continue this culture of abuse,\" the letter stated. \"We decided it is time for you to hear our voices.\"\n\n\"The concerns of Congress,\" the women wrote about were prompted after two women who worked for the agency testified before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in December 2016. They testified after a few women shared their stories in a Huffington Post Highline report. Multiple class-action lawsuits have also been filed against the agency over the years.\n\nThe women claim the agency took no action and there were no \"positive changes to the work environment\" even after the hearing.\n\n\"We watched Congressman Chaffetz, Congressman Cummings, Congressman Gowdy, Congresswoman Speier, and others tell Deputy Chief Lenise Lago and Assistant Secretary Joe Leonard that they did not believe their \"data\" and told them to fix the problems of gender discrimination and sexual harassment,\" the letter stated. \"We hoped the agency would take action.\"\n\nFueled by the agency's lack of effort to confront the ongoing issue, the women said they continued to speak to media outlets in hopes of garnering more attention to expose the agency's shortcomings.\n\nJohn Crepeau/The Missoulian via AP, FILE\n\n\"When PBS aired in March 2018 we had hope again,\" the women stated after the outlet published its investigation of women who reported harassment and received retaliation in return.

We never thought, for example, that we were going to play in Israel or that we were going to be playing two years ago in the White House.\"\n\nMore than a dozen Latin artists honored the band with renditions of its greatest hits. Gilberto Santa Rosa sang a salsa version of \"Bendita tu Luz,\" Pablo Albor\u00e1n performed a pop rendition of \"Rayando el Sol,\" and Pepe Aguilar accompanied by the Mariachi Sol de M\u00e9xico de Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez interpreted \"Mariposa Traicionera.\"\n\nThe academy bestowed the honor on the band for its achievements and contributions to the Latin community and support of environmental protection and human rights causes.\n\nMana has highlighted environmental, social, political and human rights issues for more than 30 years through its songs, concerts and, more recently, social media. It has also promoted the Latino vote in the U.S. and has denounced what it deems as social injustices in countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia.\n\nOlvera on Monday visited a temporary shelter in the Mexican state of Jalisco where members of a caravan of Central Americans attempting to reach the U.S. border were resting.

We've been supporting the immigrants here in the United States for more than 20 years,\" Olvera said. \"At the end of the day, we are brothers, we are human beings... We shouldn't be afraid of them... I told them be careful. I saw babies, I saw children.

The steps are part of agreements signed in September during a meeting between their leaders in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital.\n\nOn Thursday, South Korea's military invited a group of journalists to watch the destruction of a guard post with dynamite in the central border area of Cheorwon. The journalists were asked to stay hundreds of meters (yards) away as black smoke enveloped the hilly border area. They later watched soldiers and other workers bulldoze another guard post.\n\nMost of the South Korean guard posts are being destroyed with construction equipment for environmental and safety reasons, but dynamite was used for the first structure because of its location on a high hill where it was difficult to use excavators, the Defense Ministry said.\n\nNorth Korea is demolishing its guard posts with explosives, according to South Korean media.\n\nThe guard posts are inside the 248-kilometer (155-mile) -long, 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) -wide border called the Demilitarized Zone. Despite its name, it's the world's most heavily fortified border with an estimated 2 million land mines planted in and near the zone.\n\nThe area has been the site of violence and bloodshed since the 1945 division of the Korean Peninsula, and civilians need special government approval to enter the zone.\n\nThe Koreas each agreed to dismantle or disarm 11 of their guard posts by the end of this month before jointly verifying the destruction next month. South Korea had about 60 posts inside the DMZ guarded by layers of barbed wire and manned by troops with machine guns. North Korea was estimated to have 160 such front-line posts.\n\nUnder the September agreements, the Koreas are also disarming the shared border village of Panmunjom and clearing mines from another DMZ area where they plan their first-ever joint searches for Korean War dead. They've also halted live-fire exercises along the border.\n\nThe deals are among a set of steps they have taken since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reached out to Seoul and Washington early this year with a vague commitment to nuclear disarmament. The fast-improving inter-Korean ties have raised worries among many in South Korea and the United States as global diplomacy on the North's nuclear weapons program has produced little recent progress.\n\nSpeaking in Washington on Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon acknowledged that criticism and offered reassurance that the South would not pursue economic cooperation with the North until there's \"significant progress\" on denuclearization.\n\nBut he argued that improving inter-Korean relation would help, not hinder that process. He said another summit between South and North Korea could still take place this year. If it happens, Cho said it would break a \"glass ceiling\" in inter-Korean relations and could pave the way for another U.S.-North Korea summit.\n\n\"Chairman Kim's visit to Seoul and South Korea is something that we have agreed upon, something that we can implement and something that is possible,\" Cho said at the Wilson Center think tank.\n\nThe two Korean leaders have already met three times this year, most recently in North Korea's capital in September. But a lack of progress in U.S.-led efforts to get the North to give up its nukes has added to doubts about whether plans for South Korean President Moon Jae-in to host Kim in the South Korean capital during 2018 can be realized.\n\nIf Kim, a third-generation hereditary ruler, visits Seoul, he would be the first North Korean leader to do so since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKim reported from Seoul, South Korea.

The move, which takes effect in 48 hours, leaves Netanyahu with the support of just 61 out of 120 lawmakers.\n\nWith other coalition partners also flexing their muscles and the opposition parties demanding an early election, the days of Netanyahu's current government seem to be numbered.\n\nNetanyahu was meeting with coalition partners on Thursday. Two of them, Moshe Kahlon of the centrist Kulanu Party and Arye Deri of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, both urged him to call early elections.\n\nKahlon told the prime minister that holding elections would be the \"right thing to do\" in the current environment, and that a new, strong and stable government should be formed, his office said.\n\nLate on Thursday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry announced that Netanyahu had canceled a planned trip to Austria next week amid the deepening crisis.\n\nLieberman's abrupt resignation came in protest to a cease-fire reached with Gaza militants that ended two days of intense fighting. The hard-liner had demanded a far harsher Israeli response to the widest wave of Gaza rocket fire against Israel since a 50-day war in 2014, but was overruled by Netanyahu.\n\nIn his live TV announcement on Wednesday, Lieberman lashed out the government's weakness and termed the cease-fire \"surrender to terrorism.\"\n\nThe move immediately set off furious political jockeying, with insiders predicting it marked the opening salvo of a new political campaign.\n\nParliamentary elections are schedule for a year from now but Israeli governments rarely serve out their full terms. The last time that happened was in 1988. Since then, elections have almost always been moved up because of a coalition crisis or a strategic move by the prime minister to maximize his chances of re-election.\n\nNetanyahu's fiercest coalition rival, Education Minister Naftali Bennett of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, was the first to pounce, threatening to leave the coalition too if he wasn't appointed defense minister in Lieberman's place. That, however, appeared unlikely given the bad blood between the two and the overall shaky nature of such a slim coalition. The two were expected to meet on Friday.\n\nThe government also faces a looming Supreme Court-dictated deadline to pass a contentious new law mandating the military draft of ultra-Orthodox men. It has deeply divided the coalition and threatened to break it up even before Lieberman bolted.\n\n\"It was very difficult yesterday evening to find anyone in the political establishment who would say that elections are far off. Any date between March and May 2019 appears logical,\" wrote columnist Ben Caspit in the Maariv daily. \"The Netanyahu government is stumbling toward its end.\"\n\nWith such uncertainty, the major players are already positioning themselves.\n\n\"This government has failed to establish deterrence. This is not a right-wing government and there is no point to its existence,\" Bennett's party colleague, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, told Israel's Army Radio. \"Bennett could be a big help to the prime minister as defense minister.\"\n\nNetanyahu has been reportedly flirting with the idea of moving up elections himself, but the current timing is not ideal for him. He has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the cease-fire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class, rocket-battered towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his ruling Likud Party.\n\nA poll aired Wednesday on Israel's top-rated TV newscast after Lieberman's resignation showed 74 percent of Israelis to be displeased with Netanyahu's handling of the recent Gaza crisis.\n\nNetanyahu still appeared to have little competition for the post of prime minister, though support for his Likud party dipped compared to previous polls. If elections were held today, Likud looked to win 29 seats, followed by the centrist Yesh Atid party at 18 and Labor at 11.\n\nThe Midgam poll surveyed 500 Israelis and had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.\n\nNetanyahu is also vulnerable to a potential corruption indictment that could rattle the entire political campaign.\n\nPolice have already questioned Netanyahu a dozen times and recommended that he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases. The first involves allegedly taking gifts from billionaires and the second for allegedly discussing legislation that favored a major newspaper in exchange for positive media coverage. Netanyahu has also been grilled about a corruption case involving Israel's telecom giant.\n\nIsrael's attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, is expected to make a decision on charges in the coming months.\n\nNetanyahu has angrily rejected the accusations against him as part of a media-orchestrated witch-hunt that is obsessed with removing him from office."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "House blocks bill to end support for Saudi coalition in Yemen as UK yields diplomatic progress - ABC News", "description": "ABC News House blocks bill to end support for Saudi coalition in Yemen as UK yields diplomatic progress ABC News The House of Representatives voted to block the passage of a bill that would have ended U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-blocks-bill-end-support-saudi-coalition-yemen/story?id%3D59208707", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T07:49:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "EU sets Nov. 25 as summit day to endorse Brexit", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Two Cabinet ministers resigned and some lawmakers from May's own party called for her to be replaced. The crisis threatened to destroy the Brexit agreement, unseat the prime minister and send the U.K. hurtling toward the EU exit without a plan.\n\nIn an evening news conference aimed at regaining some control, May said she believed \"with every fiber of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people.\"\n\n\"Am I going to see this through? Yes,\" she said.\n\nThe hard-won agreement with the EU has infuriated pro-Brexit members of May's divided Conservative Party. They say the agreement, which calls for close trade ties between the U.K. and the bloc, would leave Britain a vassal state, bound to EU rules it has no say in making.\n\nMay insisted that Brexit meant making \"the right choices, not the easy ones\" and urged lawmakers to support the deal \"in the national interest.\"\n\nBut she was weakened by the resignation of two senior Cabinet ministers, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab. Hours after he sat in the meeting that approved the deal, Raab said he \"cannot in good conscience\" support it.\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey followed Raab out the door. She said in a letter that it is \"no good trying to pretend to (voters) that this deal honors the result of the referendum when it is obvious to everyone that it doesn't.\"\n\nA handful of junior government ministers also quit, and leading pro-Brexit lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg called for a vote of no-confidence in May.\n\nRees-Mogg said May's deal \"is not Brexit\" because it would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU, potentially for an indefinite period. He said May was \"losing the confidence of Conservative members of Parliament.\"\n\nRees-Mogg called for May to be replaced by a more firmly pro-Brexit politician, naming ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Raab as potential successors.\n\nUnder Conservative rules, a confidence vote in the leader is triggered if 15 percent of Conservative lawmakers \u2014 currently 48 \u2014 write a letter to the party's 1922 Committee of backbenchers, which oversees leadership votes.\n\nOnly committee chairman Graham Brady knows for sure how many missives have been sent, but Rees-Mogg's letter is likely to spur others to do the same.\n\nIf a confidence vote is held and May loses, it would trigger a party leadership contest in which any Conservative lawmaker \u2014 except her \u2014 could run.\n\nThe turmoil is the latest eruption in the Conservative Party's long-running civil war over Europe. Ever since Britain joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, the party has been split between supporters and opponents of Britain's membership. In 2016, then-Prime Minister David Cameron called a referendum \"to settle this European question in British politics\" once and for all.\n\nHe was confident the country would vote to remain, but voters opted by 52 percent to 48 percent to quit the EU, a result that left both the Conservatives and the country more divided than ever. Cameron's successor, May, has been struggling ever since to deliver a Brexit that satisfies those who want to leave, reconciles those wanting to remain and doesn't rock the economy \u2014 a near-impossible balancing act.\n\nThursday's political mayhem prompted a big fall in the value of the pound, which was trading 1.5 percent lower at $1.2797 as investors fretted that Britain could crash out of the EU in March without a deal. That could see tariffs on British exports, border checks and restrictions on travelers and workers \u2014 a potentially toxic combination for businesses.\n\nBusiness groups have warned that if there is no deal by next month, companies will have to enact contingency plans that could include cutting jobs, stockpiling goods, and relocating production overseas.\n\nMay and her supporters say the alternatives to her deal \u2014 leaving the bloc without a deal or a second vote on Brexit \u2014 are not realistic options.\n\nIf the agreement was abandoned, \"nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow,\" May said. \"It would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it.\"\n\nNews that a deal had been struck after a year and a half of negotiations was welcomed in Brussels, and EU chief Donald Tusk called for a Nov. 25 summit of leaders so they can rubber-stamp the agreement.\n\nThe deal requires the consent of the European Parliament, whose chief Brexit official, Guy Verhofstadt, welcomed it as \"the best agreement we could obtain.\"\n\nIt also needs approval from Britain's Parliament before the U.K. leaves the bloc on March 29 \u2014 and even if May survives as leader, the chances of that look slim.\n\nHer Conservative government doesn't have a parliamentary majority, and relies on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland.\n\nBut the DUP has rejected the deal, saying its provisions to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland would impose new barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K., weakening the bonds that hold the United Kingdom together.\n\nOpposition parties also signaled they would vote against the agreement.\n\nMain opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said May should withdraw the \"half-baked\" Brexit deal and that Parliament \"cannot and will not accept a false choice between this deal and no deal.\"\n\nIan Blackford, who heads the Scottish National Party in Parliament, said the deal was \"dead on arrival\" and urged May to \"stop the clock and go back to Brussels.\"\n\nAn EU official warned that Britain was unlikely to get a better deal. Speaking on condition of anonymity because the process is still ongoing, the official said both sides \"exhausted our margin of maneuver under our respective mandates.\"\n\nIn Brussels, where some EU officials hold out hope that Britain will change its mind about Brexit, officials watched the political upheaval with interest.\n\nTusk said it was \"not for me to comment on the latest developments in London.\"\n\n\"All I can say is that the EU is prepared for a final deal with the U.K. in November,\" he said. \"We are also prepared for a no deal scenario \u2014 but of course we are best prepared for a no-Brexit scenario.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCasert reported from Brussels.

Special Envoy Martin Griffiths, and this week, there were some important breakthroughs.\n\nThe British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt visited Saudi Arabia and the UAE and announced Tuesday that the coalition would allow for a group of Houthi fighters to be medically evacuated to neighboring Oman. While a seemingly small step, previous hurdles became an issue in the last round of U.N. talks in September, with the Houthis refusing to show in part out of protest for that.\n\nThe U.K. said Tuesday that \"serious consideration\" was being given by both sides to \"a set of political ideas and confidence-building measures that would allow for the start of political talks in Sweden by the end of November\" -- a goal that remains in sight, diplomats tell ABC News -- but it's unclear what those may include.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nThe U.S. has called on the Houthis to stop missile attacks into Saudi and Emirati territory and for the coalition to then halt bombing of civilian-held areas.\n\nWhile that hasn't happened yet -- and fighting had actually escalated around the key port Hodeida last week -- sources tell ABC News that progress is being made.\n\nA Western diplomat, who wished to remain anonymous, said that's in part because the Emiratis are beginning to signal that they want out of the conflict. Their withdrawal could put the Saudis in a more difficult spot on their own, pushing them to peace talks, too.\n\nThe Trump administration continues to focus on Iran's role in the conflict, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repeatedly pointing to it as the greatest threat and source of instability. But the Western diplomat added that Iran is not as entrenched in Yemen as it is elsewhere, like Syria or Lebanon, creating an opening for the international community, not a challenge.\n\n\"You can draw the Houthis in if you give them a stake in the political settlement and throw a lot of rials at them,\" the diplomat said, referencing the Iranian currency."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Israeli police: Palestinian stabs officers in police station", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Since late March, thousands of Gazans have joined the Hamas-led demonstrations in a bid to end a crippling Israeli blockade.\n\nProtesters frequently lob grenades, flaming tires and firebombs toward Israeli troops, who respond with tear gas and live fire. Some 170 Palestinians, many of them unarmed, have been killed by Israeli fire.

The fighting left a total of 14 Palestinians, including 12 militants, dead. An Israeli officer was killed during the Gaza raid, while a Palestinian laborer who worked in Israel was killed in a rocket attack.\n\nIn their announcement, protest organizers in Gaza urged people to demonstrate Friday \"to thank the resistance\" for battling Israel.\n\nBut in statements on Facebook, organizers also urged demonstrators to stay away from the border fence, a sign that Friday's protest would be restrained.\n\nIn another sign of quiet, Hamas announced Thursday that Egyptian mediators had arrived in Gaza to work on promoting a deeper cease-fire arrangement with Israel.\n\nHamas and its supporters have celebrated the cease-fire as a victory against the powerful Israeli military.\n\nIn Israel, the cease-fire has triggered a political crisis. Israel's defense minister, who favored a much harsher response, resigned to protest the truce, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could soon be forced to call an early election.\n\nAngry Israelis in rocket-scarred southern communities near Gaza have protested against the cease-fire in recent days.

Rajapaksa, a former president, is considered a hero by some in the ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending a long civil war by crushing ethnic Tamil Tiger rebels. However, his time in power was marred by allegations of wartime atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena also had suspended Parliament, apparently to allow Rajapaksa time to gather support among lawmakers. But Wickremesinghe insisted his firing was unconstitutional. He refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned to prove he still has support.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday suspended Sirisena's order to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections next month.\n\nThe political turmoil in Sri Lanka has drawn statements of concern from Western governments since Sirisena ousted Wickremesinghe. The United States said Thursday that it was closely following developments and urged all parties \"to adhere to the rule of law.\"\n\n\"There is much at stake, and a prolonged crisis will jeopardize Sri Lanka's democracy, economic progress and international reputation,\" the State Department said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Rival lawmakers come to blows in Sri Lankan Parliament over PM dispute as speaker says country has no government", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

That led authorities to devise a staggered evacuation plan \u2014 one that they used when fire came again last week.\n\nBut Paradise's carefully laid plans quickly devolved into a panicked exodus last week. Some survivors said that by the time they got warnings, the flames were already extremely close, and they barely escaped with their lives. Others said they received no warnings at all.\n\nNow authorities are facing questions of whether they took the right approach.\n\nIt's also a lesson for other communities across the West that could be threatened as climate change and overgrown forests contribute to longer, more destructive fire seasons .\n\nReeny Victoria Breevaart, who lives in Magalia, a forested community of 11,000 people north of Paradise, said she couldn't receive warnings because cellphones weren't working. She also lost electrical power.\n\nJust over an hour after the first evacuation order was issued at 8 a.m., she said, neighbors came to her door to say: \"You have to get out of here.\"\n\nShari Bernacett, who with her husband managed a mobile home park in Paradise where they also lived, received a text ordering an evacuation. \"Within minutes the flames were on top of us,\" she said.\n\nBernacett packed two duffel bags while her husband and another neighbor knocked on doors, yelling for people to get out. The couple grabbed their dog and drove through 12-foot (4-meter) flames to escape.\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, survivors said authorities need to devise a plan to reach residents who can't get a cellphone signal in the hilly terrain or don't have cellphones at all.\n\nIn his defense, Honea said evacuation orders were issued through 5,227 emails, 25,643 phone calls and 5,445 texts, in addition to social media and the use of loudspeakers. As cellphone service went down, authorities went into neighborhoods with bullhorns to tell people to leave, and that effort saved lives.\n\nHonea said he was too busy with the emergency and the recovery of human remains to analyze how the evacuation went. But he said it was a big, chaotic, fast-moving situation, and there weren't enough law enforcement officers to go out and warn everyone.\n\n\"The fact that we have thousands and thousands of people in shelters would clearly indicate that we were able to notify a significant number of people,\" the sheriff said.\n\nSome evacuees were staying in tents and cars at a Walmart parking lot and in a nearby field in Chico, though volunteers are planning to close the makeshift shelter by Sunday.\n\nA Sunday closure \"gives us enough time to maybe figure something out,\" said Mike Robertson, an evacuee who arrived there on Monday with his wife and two daughters.\n\nOn Thursday, firefighters reported progress in battling the nearly 220-square-mile (570-square-kilometer) blaze that displaced 52,000 people and destroyed more than 9,500 homes. It was 40 percent contained, fire officials said. Crews slowed the flames' advance on populated areas.\n\nCalifornia Army National Guard members, wearing white jumpsuits, looked for human remains in the burned rubble, among more than 450 rescue workers assigned to the task.\n\nPresident Donald Trump plans to travel to California on Saturday to visit victims of the wildfires burning at both ends of the state. Trump is unpopular in much of Democratic-leaning California but not in Butte County, which he carried by 4 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nThe Paradise fire once again underscored shortcomings in warning systems.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown signed a bill in September requiring the development of statewide guidelines for Amber Alert-like warnings. A few Northern California communities are moving to install sirens after wine country residents complained they didn't receive warnings to evacuate ahead of a deadly wildfire in October 2017 that destroyed 5,300 homes.\n\nIn 2008, the pair of wildfires that menaced Paradise destroyed 130 homes. No one was seriously hurt, but the chaos highlighted the need for a plan.\n\nParadise sits on a ridge between two higher hills, with only one main exit out of town. The best solution seemed to be to order evacuations in phases, so people didn't get trapped.\n\n\"Gridlock is always the biggest concern,\" said William Stewart, a forestry professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAuthorities developed an evacuation plan that split the town of 27,000 into zones and called for a staggered exodus. Paradise even conducted a mock evacuation during a morning commute, turning the main thoroughfare into a one-way street out of town.\n\nLast week, when a wind-whipped fire bore down on the town, the sheriff's department attempted an orderly, phased evacuation, instead of blasting a cellphone alert over an entire area.\n\nPhil John, chairman of the Paradise Ridge Fire Safe Council, defended the evacuation plan he helped develop. John said that the wildfire this time was exceptionally fast-moving and hot, and that no plan was going to work perfectly.\n\nWhen the fire reached the eastern edge of Paradise, six zones were ordered to clear out about 8 a.m. But almost simultaneously, the gusting winds were carrying embers the size of dinner plates across town, and structures were catching fire throughout the city. Less than an hour later, the entire town was ordered evacuated.\n\n\"It didn't work perfectly,\" John said Thursday. \"But no one could plan for a fire like that.\"\n\nLikewise, Stewart, the forestry professor, said the wildfire that hit Paradise disrupted the orderly evacuation plan because it \"was moving too fast. All hell broke loose.\"\n\nSatellite images show half the town on fire less than two hours after the first evacuation order.\n\nStewart said experts continue to debate how best to issue evacuation orders, and no ideal solution has been found.\n\nAt the other end of the state, meanwhile, crews continued to gain ground against a blaze of more than 153 square miles (396 square kilometers) that destroyed over 500 structures in Malibu and other Southern California communities. At least three deaths were reported.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Janie Har and Olga R.

She said she had never asked to return to Myanmar, and that she had sent her children to a school run by aid workers Thursday morning as usual.\n\n\"They killed my husband; now I live here with my parents,\" said Setara, who only gave one name. \"I don't want to go back.\"\n\nShe said that other refugees on the repatriation list had fled to other camps, hoping to disappear amid the crowded lanes of refugees, aid workers and Bangladeshi soldiers, which on Thursday were bustling with commerce and other activity.\n\nBangladesh had planned to send an initial group of 2,251 back from mid-November at a rate of 150 per day.\n\nMyanmar officials, speaking late Thursday in the captal, Naypyitaw, said they were ready to receive the refugees. Despite those assurances, human rights activists said conditions were not yet safe for the Rohingya to go back.\n\nThe exodus began after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following attacks by an insurgent group on guard posts. The scale, organization and ferocity of the crackdown led the U.N. and several governments to accuse Myanmar of ethnic cleansing and genocide.\n\nMost people in Buddhist-majority Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya Muslims are a native ethnic group, viewing them as \"Bengalis\" who entered illegally from Bangladesh, even though generations of Rohingya have lived in Myanmar. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, as well as access to education and hospitals.\n\nThe refugees survived the ransacking of villages, rapes and killings in Myanmar, but for many, life in Bangladesh's squalid refugee camps has been bleak.\n\nThe refugees who've arrived in the last year joined a wave of 250,000 Rohingya Muslims who escaped forced labor, religious persecution and violent attacks from Buddhist mobs in Myanmar during the early 1990s.\n\nAccess to education and employment has been far from assured.\n\nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who hopes to retain power in December elections, has repeatedly complained that hosting more than a million Rohingya is taxing local resources.\n\nNegotiations for repatriation have been in the works for months, but plans last January to begin sending refugees back were called off amid concerns among aid workers and Rohingya that their return would be met with violence.\n\nForeign leaders, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, criticized Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore for her handling of the Rohingya crisis.\n\nBut on Thursday, Pence said that U.S. officials were \"encouraged to hear that\" the repatriation process would begin.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would continue working with international partners including the U.N. \"to ensure that the Rohingya themselves are part of any decisions on their future.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSchmall reported from New Delhi.

The news network is seeking an immediate restraining order that would force the White House to hand back Acosta's credentials, which grant reporters access into the 18-acre complex.\n\nAcosta has clashed repeatedly with Trump and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in briefings over the last two years. But the dynamic devolved into a near-shouting match during a combative press conference last week following midterm elections in which Republicans lost control of the House.\n\nAcosta refused to give up a microphone when the president said he didn't want to hear anything more from him. Trump called Acosta a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\nThe White House quickly announced that Acosta's White House access would be revoked.\n\nThe CNN lawsuit calls the revocation \"an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the President's point of view.\"\n\nJustice Department lawyer James Burnham argued that Acosta was guilty of \"inappropriate grandstanding\" and deserved to lose his access over \"his refusal to comply with the general standards of a press conference.\"\n\nBurnham said that the White House is essentially Trump's home and office and that the president has some right to decide who can and can't be there. \"There's no First Amendment right to access the White House grounds,\" Burnham said.\n\nBurnham also pointed out that CNN has dozens of other staffers with White House credentials, so excluding Acosta would not harm the network's coverage.\n\nThe network's lawyer, Theodore Boutrous, contended that Acosta was being singled out for his White House coverage, not his alleged rudeness during a news conference.\n\n\"The White House has made very clear that they don't like the content of the reporting by CNN and Jim Acosta,\" Boutrous said. \"Rudeness really is a code word for 'I don't like you being an aggressive reporter.'\"\n\nTrump, in an interview published Wednesday, told The Daily Caller that \"guys like Acosta\" were \"bad for the country. ... He's just an average guy who's a grandstander who's got the guts to stand up and shout.\"\n\nA number of news organizations, including The Associated Press, announced their intention to file amicus briefs with the court in support of CNN.\n\nThe White House's explanations for why it seized Acosta's credentials have shifted over the last week.\n\nSanders initially explained the decision by accusing Acosta of making improper physical contact with the intern seeking to grab the microphone. But that rationale disappeared after witnesses backed Acosta's account that he was just trying to keep the microphone, and Sanders distributed a doctored video that made it appear Acosta was more aggressive than he actually was.

At a news conference, Georgia Democrats cast dou\u2026 [+5818 chars]", "fulltext": "As the candidates in the disputed race for Georgia governor retreated further into their corners, counties across the state on Thursday began a court-ordered process of reviewing absentee ballots and counting those previously rejected for missing or incorrect dates of birth.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Robyn Crittenden issued guidance to counties to review the absentee ballots, count those rejected for missing or incorrect dates of birth and recertify results if the counts change. She set a deadline of 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nThe campaign of Democrat Stacey Abrams has ratcheted up its attacks on Republican Brian Kemp, while Kemp continues to claim that results certified by county election officials confirm he has an \"insurmountable lead.\"\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, Georgia Democrats cast doubt on the legitimacy of any election count that ends with former secretary of state Kemp being certified as the winner of a fiercely fought election against Abrams, who's seeking to become the first black woman elected governor in the U.S.\n\n\"We believe that Brian Kemp mismanaged this election to sway it in his favor,\" said Abrams' campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo, surrounded by Democratic lawmakers at the Georgia Capitol.\n\nDemocrats beyond Georgia have started to echo the notion that a Kemp victory would be illegitimate. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown said Wednesday that if Abrams loses it's because Republicans stole the election.\n\n\"If Stacey Abrams doesn't win in Georgia, they stole it. I say that publicly, it's clear,\" Brown, speaking at a briefing for the National Action Network, said, without presenting any evidence.\n\nKemp's campaign, which has repeatedly called on Abrams to concede, repeated that call Wednesday, saying Abrams and her supporters have used \"fake vote totals,\" ''desperate press conferences\" and \"dangerous lawsuits\" to try to steal the election.\n\n\"After all of the theatrics, the math remains the same,\" Kemp campaign spokesman Cody Hall said in an email. \"Abrams lost and Brian Kemp won. This election is over.\"\n\nSince he declared himself governor last week and resigned as secretary of state, Kemp's lead has narrowed as counties have tabulated more ballots. And the numbers could change again as federal courts issue new guidance on counting certain provisional and absentee ballots.\n\nGroh-Wargo said Tuesday that the Abrams campaign believes she needs a net gain of 17,759 votes to pull Kemp below a majority threshold and force a Dec. 4 runoff. Kemp's campaign said even if every vote that Abrams' campaign is arguing for is granted by the courts and counted for her, she cannot overcome his lead or force a runoff.\n\nThe Associated Press said Thursday that it would not declare a winner in the race until state officials certified the results.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Steve Jones ruled that the secretary of state must not certify the state election results without confirming that each county's vote tally includes absentee ballots on which the voter's date of birth is missing or incorrect.\n\nThe order stems from a request in a lawsuit filed Sunday by the Abrams campaign. But Jones also rejected the campaign's other requests.\n\nHe declined to extend the period during which evidence could be submitted to prove the eligibility of voters who cast provisional ballots. He also declined to order that provisional ballots cast by voters who went to a precinct in the wrong county be counted.\n\nThe lawsuit was one of several election-related complaints filed before multiple federal judges.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leigh May ordered Gwinnett County election officials Tuesday not to reject absentee ballots just because the voter's birth year is missing or wrong. She also ordered the county to delay certification of its election results until those ballots have been counted.\n\nJones' ruling effectively extended May's order to the other 158 counties in Georgia.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg late Monday ordered state officials not to do their final certification of election results before 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nState law sets a Nov. 20 deadline, but secretary of state's office elections director Chris Harvey testified last week that the state had planned to certify the election results Wednesday, a day after the deadline for counties to certify their results. He said that would allow preparations to begin for any runoff contests, including those already projected in the races for secretary of state and a Public Service Commission seat.\n\nTotenberg's order left untouched the county certification deadline. Candice Broce, a spokeswoman for secretary of state's office, said Wednesday that all counties but Gwinnett have certified their totals.\n\nTotenberg ordered the secretary of state's office to establish and publicize a hotline or website enabling voters to check whether their provisional ballots were counted and, if not, why not. And she ordered the secretary of state's office to review or have county election authorities review the eligibility of voters who had to cast provisional ballots because of registration issues.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Russ Bynum and Ben Nadler in Atlanta and Juana Summers in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Barrow and Brumback on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP and https://twitter.com/katebrumback ."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Migrants fill Tijuana shelters, more on way to US border", "description": "The first members of a caravan of Central Americans to reach the U.S. border are sleeping in overcrowded shelters and in tents with a view of U.S. Border Patrol agents, with many saying they will wait for other migrants to arrive before their next move", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/migrants-fill-tijuana-shelters-us-border-59208635", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_359e0c83bb934f938888f48fbdeb33f6_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T05:06:42Z", "content": "The first members of a caravan of Central Americans to reach the U.S. border slept in overcrowded shelters and in tents with a view of armed U.S. Border Patrol agents, with many saying they will wait for other migrants to join them before making their next mo\u2026 [+5524 chars]", "fulltext": "More buses of exhausted people in a caravan of Central American asylum seekers reached the U.S. border Thursday as the city of Tijuana converted a municipal gymnasium into a temporary shelter and the migrants came to grips with the reality that they will be on the Mexican side of the frontier for an extended stay.\n\nWith U.S. border inspectors at the main crossing into San Diego processing only about 100 asylum claims a day, it could take weeks if not months to process the thousands in the caravan that departed from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, more than a month ago.\n\nTijuana's robust network of shelters was already stretched to the limit, having squeezed in double their capacity or more as families slept on the floor on mats, forcing the city to open the gymnasium for up to 360 people Wednesday. A gated outdoor courtyard can accommodate hundreds more.\n\nThe city's thriving factories are always looking for workers, and several thousand Haitian migrants who were turned away at the U.S. border have found jobs and settled here in the last two years, but the prospect of thousands more destitute Central Americans has posed new challenges.\n\nDelia Avila, director of Tijuana's family services department, who is helping spearhead the city's response, said migrants who can arrange legal status in Mexico are welcome to stay.\n\n\"Tijuana is a land of migrants. Tijuana is a land that has known what it is to embrace thousands of co-nationals and also people from other countries,\" Avila said.\n\nMexican law enforcement was out in force in a city that is suffering an all-time-high homicide rate. A group of about 50 migrants, mostly women and children, walked through downtown streets Thursday from the city shelter to a breakfast hall under police escort.\n\nAs buses from western and central Mexico trickled in overnight and into the morning, families camped inside the bus terminal and waited for word on where they could find a safe place to sleep. One shelter designed for 45 women and children was housing 100; another designed for 100 had nearly 200.\n\nMany endured the evening chill to sleep at an oceanfront park with a view of San Diego office towers and heavily armed U.S. Border Patrol agents on the other side of a steel-bollard fence.\n\nOscar Zapata, 31, reached the Tijuana bus station at 2 a.m. from Guadalajara with his wife and their three children, ages 4, 5 and 12, and headed to the breakfast hall, where migrants were served free beef and potatoes.\n\nBack home in La Ceiba, Honduras, he was selling pirated CDs and DVDs in the street when two gangs demanded \"protection\" money. He had already seen a colleague gunned down on a street corner because he couldn't pay. He said gangs called him and his wife on their cellphones and showed up at their house, threatening to kidnap his daughter and force her into prostitution if he didn't pay.\n\nWhen he heard about the caravan on the TV news last month, he didn't think twice.\n\n\"It was the opportunity to get out,\" Zapata said.\n\nZapata said he hopes to join a brother in Los Angeles but has not yet decided on his next move. Like many others, he planned to wait in Tijuana for others in the caravan to arrive and gather more information before seeking asylum in the United States.\n\nByron Jose Blandino, a 27-year-old bricklayer from Nicaragua who slept in the converted gymnasium, said he wanted to request asylum but not until he could speak with someone well-versed in U.S. law and asylum procedures.\n\n\"The first thing is to wait,\" Blandino said. \"I do not want to break the laws of any country. If I could enter in a peaceful manner, that would be good.\n\nTo claim asylum in San Diego, migrants enter their names in a tattered notebook held together by duct tape and managed by the migrants in a plaza outside the entry to the main border crossing.\n\nOn Thursday, migrants who registered six weeks ago were getting their names called. The waiting list has grown to more than 3,000 names and stands to become much longer with the caravans.\n\nFrancisco Rueda, the top deputy to Baja California state Gov. Francisco Vega de la Madrid, said that if all migrants from the caravan currently in Tijuana were to register to seek asylum in the U.S., they would likely have to wait four months in Mexico at current processing rates. For that reason, the state has asked Mexican federal authorities to encourage others in caravans to go to other border cities.\n\nRueda reported that about 1,750 migrants from the caravan had now reached Tijuana. Private shelters can house about 700, and the city-owned gym and sports complex has a capacity of 1,000 with the potential to expand to 3,000.\n\n\"This is not a crisis,\" he told reporters, while allowing that \"this is an extraordinary situation.\"\n\nThere are 7,000 jobs available in the state for those who can obtain legal status in Mexico, Rueda said. He touted Tijuana's integration of Haitian migrants over the last two years and the state's relatively low unemployment rate.\n\nThe migrants have met some resistance from local residents, about 100 of whom confronted a similar-size group of Central Americans who were camped out by the U.S. border fence Wednesday night.\n\n\"You're not welcome\" and \"Get out!\" the locals said, marching up to the group.\n\nPolice kept the two sides apart.\n\nVladimir Cruz, a migrant from El Salvador, shook his head and said: \"These people are the racists, because 95 percent of people here support us.\"\n\n\"It is just this little group. ... They are uncomfortable because we're here,\" Cruz said.\n\nPlayas de Tijuana, as the area is known, is an upper-middle-class enclave, and residents appeared worried about crime and sanitation. One protester shouted, \"This isn't about discrimination, it is about safety!\"\n\nThere are real questions about how the city of more than 1.6 million will manage to handle the migrant caravans working their way through Mexico, which may total 10,000 people in all.\n\n\"No city in the world is prepared to receive this number of migrants,\" said Tijuana social development director Mario Osuna, adding that the city hopes Mexico's federal government \"will start legalizing these people immediately\" so they can get jobs and earn a living.\n\nDozens of gay and transgender migrants in the caravan were already lining up Thursday to submit asylum claims, though it was unclear how soon they would be able to do so.\n\nThe caravan has fragmented somewhat in recent days in a final push to the border, with some migrants moving rapidly in buses and others falling behind.\n\nOn Thursday, hundreds were stranded for most of the day at a gas station in Navojoa, some 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) from Tijuana.\n\n\"We were dropped here at midnight ... in the middle of nowhere, where supposedly some buses were going to come pick us up, but nothing,\" Alejandra Grisel Rodriguez of Honduras told The Associated Press by phone. \"We are without water, without food.\"\n\nAfter about 12 hours seven buses began arriving to collect the migrants, Rodriguez said, but they quickly filled up.\n\n\"We would need at least 40 or 50,\" she said.\n\nJesus Edmundo Valdez, coordinator of firefighters and civil defense in Navojoa, said Wednesday that authorities were providing food, water and medical attention to migrants there. His phone rang unanswered Thursday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Maria Verza in Culiacan, Mexico, contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Electronic driving systems don't always work, tests show", "description": "Testing by AAA shows that electronic driver assist systems on the road today may not stay in their lanes or spot stationary objects in time to avoid a crash", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/electronic-driving-systems-work-tests-show-59208673", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T05:06:18Z", "content": "Testing by AAA shows that electronic driver assist systems on the road today may not keep vehicles in their lanes or spot stationary objects in time to avoid a crash.

In August, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released tests that showed similar problems to the AAA study.\n\nThe auto club tested the systems on four vehicles that had adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and automatic emergency braking. Vehicles tested included the 2018 Mercedes-Benz S Class, the 2018 Nissan Rogue, a 2017 Tesla Model S and a 2019 Volvo XC40. In addition to Tesla's Autopilot, Volvo calls its system \"Pilot Assist,\" while Nissan's is named \"ProPilot Assist.\"\n\nAutomakers generally say they tell drivers that their cars aren't fully self-driving and that they should always be alert and ready to intervene.\n\nAAA says the vehicles drifted out of lanes and hugged lane markers, struggling with moderate traffic, curved roads and streets with busy intersections. Three of the four would have failed to avoid a crash when the vehicle ahead of them changed lanes and a simulated stopped vehicle was ahead.\n\n\"As a result we had to take evasive action,\" said Brannon.\n\nOnly the Tesla system brought the vehicle to a complete stop in all five track test runs, but driver intervention was needed for the others, the AAA report said.\n\nThe vehicles' owner's manuals say that spotting a stationary vehicle after a lead vehicle changes lanes is a design limitation for the systems, Brannon said. But he said researchers expected the vehicles to see stopped vehicles and react in time.\n\nAutomakers generally say that the systems are designed to supplement a human driver and they make it clear the vehicles don't drive themselves.\n\nNissan said its system name contains the word \"assist,\" showing that it's designed to help the driver.\n\n\"Mercedes-Benz has always stressed that this technology is designed to assist the driver, not to encourage customers to ignore their responsibilities as drivers,\" the automaker said in a statement.\n\nTesla says that it reminds drivers to keep their hands on the wheel. \"Tesla has always been clear that Autopilot doesn't make the car impervious to all accidents,\" the company said in a statement earlier this year.\n\nA message was left Thursday seeking comment from Volvo.\n\nBrannon said that despite their shortcomings, the systems have great potential to save lives and stop crashes from happening.\n\n\"Anything that can serve as a backstop to a good driver is going to enhance the safety of the system, of the driver,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Electronic driving systems don't always work, tests show", "description": "Testing by AAA shows that electronic driver assist systems on the road today may not stay in their lanes or spot stationary objects in time to avoid a crash", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/electronic-driving-systems-work-tests-show-59208638", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T05:06:03Z", "content": "Testing by AAA shows that electronic driver assist systems on the road today may not keep vehicles in their lanes or spot stationary objects in time to avoid a crash.

The Florida Department of State asked U.S. attorneys in three Florida districts to investigate, writing in a letter that creating such an altered form would be a crime.\n\nFlorida is the site of an ongoing vote recount in three statewide races, for U.S. senator, governor and state agriculture commissioner.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nFour counties -- Broward, Citrus, Okaloosa and Santa Rosa -- received forms from mail-in voters that appeared to have been altered. The altered forms instructed voters to return them \"no later than 5 p.m. on Thursday, November 8.\" The forms are due \"no later than 5 p.m. the day before the election\" -- as written on the original form.\n\n\"We respectfully ask that you take all necessary steps to investigate and remedy such abuse. Please contact us should you need any additional information,\" reads a letter Florida Department of State Interim General Counsel Bradley McVay sent to U.S. attorneys in the Northern, Middle and Southern Districts of Florida on Nov. 9.\n\nThe type of form, known as a \"vote-by-mail cure affidavit\" -- is used by voters who forgot to sign a \"vote-by-mail certificate\" when they returned their ballots, or whose signatures do not match those on file with their voter-registration records, according to Florida's Division of Elections website. Voters must return them with a copy of identification.\n\nVoters can deliver the forms in person, fax, or email them to county election officials.\n\n\"If you forgot to sign your vote-by-mail ballot certificate when you returned your ballot, or you get information that your signature on the certificate did not match your registration record, you have the opportunity to correct the situation,\" the Florida Elections Division website tells voters, guiding them to the form.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nVoters can request by-mail ballots in Florida even if they will not be absent on Election Day. By-mail ballots must be returned and received by county officials by 7 p.m. on Election Day; voters must return their affidavits correcting signature issues the day before.\n\nThe department sent copies of the altered forms, received by county officials, to the U.S. attorneys. The department provided copies to ABC News.\n\n\u201cThe Department continues to review any information or complaints we receive regarding election fraud or other criminal activity,\u201d Florida Department of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell told ABC News on Wednesday. \u201cLast Friday, the Department sent a letter to the Offices of the United States Attorneys requesting they investigate possible violations of Florida and federal elections laws that have come to our attention.\u201d\n\nFlorida's Department of State and its statewide law enforcement agency had been prompted by Attorney General Pam Bondi on Sunday to investigate any possible election-related crimes -- though not necessarily of this kind.\n\nAmid allusions to \"fraud\" by Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who narrowly leads Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in the U.S. Senate race currently undergoing a recount, Bondi had prompted the secretary of state and Florida Department of Law Enforcement commissioner to investigate any possible election misconduct, sending a letter to each on Sunday. Bondi's letter referenced some of the criticisms Scott's legal team had voiced against election officials in the Democratic counties of Broward and Palm Beach.\n\nThose criticisms related to the counting of votes by those officials, but the secretary of state's request for an investigation focuses on a different kind of alleged crime -- misleading voters as they seek to cast ballots.\n\nJoe Skipper/Getty Images\n\n\"[A]ltering a form in a manner that provided the incorrect date ... imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter's ability to vote,\" McVay wrote to the attorneys general.\n\nFlorida faces a 3 p.m. Thursday deadline to complete a machine recount of votes in the three statewide races being recounted. If any remain within a margin of 0.25 percentage points, as is likely in the Senate contest, the state will move to a manual recount of some ballots, which must be completed by Sunday -- though those deadlines are being contested by Nelson in federal court.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal court is hearing a lawsuit by Sen. Bill Nelson to invalidate Florida's law requiring that by-mail and provisional votes must include signatures that match those on file with voter-registration books -- which his campaign filed well before this request for an investigation. On Wednesday, a federal judge left open the possibility of allowing voters more time to amend and verify their signatures with county election officials.\n\nABC News reached out to the Florida Republican and Democratic parties for comment.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for any investigation of credible allegations of wrongdoing in this process,\u201d said Republican Party of Florida Chairman Blaise Ingoglia.\n\nABC News' Stephanie Wash contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Chinese automaker Zotye plans to sell vehicles in US in 2020", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The fear was justified \u2014 two co-defendants died before the trial was completed.\n\nOn Friday, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan will be judged on additional charges of crimes against humanity, such as murder, extermination, enslavement, torture and persecution on political, racial, and religious grounds; genocide, for the killings of members of the Vietnamese and Cham ethnic groups; and more breaches of the Geneva Conventions, including willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nAs members of the Khmer Rouge leadership under the late Pol Pot, they have been prosecuted under the legal doctrine of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nCases launched against four additional, middle-ranking Khmer Rouge officials have been scuttled or frozen and are unlikely to be revived.\n\nIf the current trial is the last staged by the U.N.-assisted international tribunal \u2014 officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia \u2014 it will have convicted three individuals at a cost of more than $300 million.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 after a bloody five-year civil war. They immediately attempted a radical transformation of Cambodia into a peasant society, emptying cities and forcing the population to work the land.\n\nThey backed up their rule with ruthless elimination of perceived enemies, and were driven from power in early 1979 by an invasion from neighboring Vietnam, which had suffered border attacks from Khmer Rouge forces.\n\nAlthough atrocities were carried out on a massive scale, political realities \u2014 specifically the repeated demands by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen that no more suspects be prosecuted \u2014 appear to preclude further cases being pursued by the tribunal. Hun Sen insists that further prosecutions could cause unrest.\n\nIn addition to Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, the tribunal can lay claim to only one other prosecution, resulting in the 2010 conviction of Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nHun Sen himself was a midlevel Khmer Rouge commander before defecting while the group was still in power, and several senior members of his ruling Cambodian People's Party share similar backgrounds. He helped cement his political control by making alliances with other former Khmer Rouge commanders.\n\nThe ground rules under which the tribunal was established in 2005 are complicated, providing for hybrid courts pairing Cambodian judges and prosecutors with international counterparts.\n\nCambodian court officials, known for their loyalty to Hun Sen's government, are in a position to base their judgments on the tribunal's inexact guidelines limiting prosecutions to senior leaders or persons considered \"most responsible\" for atrocities, or simply cease cooperation.\n\nAlthough Nuon Chea had an especially low profile in the already secretive group, his importance can be gauged by his nom de guerre of \"Brother Number Two,\" reflecting his position as Pol Pot's right-hand man.\n\nAccording to a 2001 study by Cambodia scholar Stephen Heder and legal expert Brian D. Tittemore, there was \"substantial and compelling evidence\" that Nuon Chea devised and implemented the Khmer Rouge's execution policies.\n\nKhieu Samphan had at one point been the smiling, polite figurehead who nominally was the head of state in the Khmer Rouge regime. He was able to trade on his reputation as an honest left-wing academic and lawmaker in 1960s Cambodia before repression drove him underground and into the jungle with the then-nascent Khmer Rouge movement.\n\nThe Heder and Tittemore study acknowledged that evidence against Khieu Samphan was not as extensive as against Nuon Chea and others, but nevertheless suggested he \"encouraged lower level (Khmer Rouge) officials to perpetrate executions and, at least in some instances, monitored and contributed to the implementation of Party policies by regional authorities.\"\n\nHeder, who for a time was an investigator for the tribunal, charged in a 1990 paper that Khieu Samphan was promoted up the ranks of the Khmer Rouge \"because he remained steadfastly loyal to his leadership and policies while others who had earlier cooperated with Pol Pot and his Communist Party were detained or killed because they disagreed with or were suspected of disagreeing with what Pol Pot was doing.\"\n\n\"Khieu Samphan's political star rose literally on heaps of corpses,\" Heder wrote.\n\nConfronted in court with such charges, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan showed little remorse. Khieu Samphan denied knowing about matters including forced marriages and violent oppression of minorities, and both men mounted political defenses.\n\nKhieu Samphan described the claim of genocide as \"Vietnamese propaganda,\" a defense he and other former Khmer Rouge leaders have made previously.\n\nCambodians have long been suspicious of Vietnam, their much bigger eastern neighbor, and prejudice against Vietnamese is widespread.\n\nKhieu Samphan also cast blame on the United States for Cambodia's problems. The U.S. heavily bombed the Cambodian countryside during the 1970-75 civil war that led to the Khmer Rouge's seizure of power.\n\n\"I want to bow to the memory of all the innocent victims but also to all those who perished by believing in a better ideal of the brighter future and who died during the five-year war under the American bombardments and (in) the conflict with the Vietnamese invaders,\" Khieu Samphan said. \"Their memory will never be honored by any international tribunal.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPeck reported from Bangkok."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Michael Avenatti denies domestic violence allegation", "description": "The attorney for Stormy Daniels said he is \"confident that I will be fully exonerated\".", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/michael-avenatti-denies-domestic-violence-allegation-59206035", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181114_vod_avenatti_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T02:21:45Z", "content": "Now Playing: Stormy Daniels, Michael Avenatti talk Michael Cohen's guilty plea Now Playing: Stormy Daniels' attorney arrested in Los Angeles: Police Now Playing: Michael Avenatti denies domestic violence allegation Now Playing: Selfie keeps man out of possibl\u2026 [+1214 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Michael Avenatti denies domestic violence allegation\n\nFirst of all I want to thank.

Justify their action or gives you just more information I think there should have been await more investigation because it was basically word of mouth and there was aware flare ups. In the end prosecutors dropped the charge in the interest of justice a classification often used in cases when they no longer think a person is guilty. Christopher's attorney Rick Flores says this case was and usually easy to pre news. Most of the time we deal with. Gray matters it's not normally black and life but this was one of those cases where I can definitively prove that he did not commit this offense.

Likewise, the incentive package that comes with it is unlike any the state has ever offered.\n\nCold hard cash is a major part of the package, but state and local officials are quick to point to other incentives used to lure Amazon that have broad benefits, including massive investments in higher education and public transportation.\n\nHere's some highlights of what's in in the deal:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCASH:\n\nVirginia's contract with Amazon agrees to pay the online retailer up to $750 million if it creates 37,850 jobs by 2039. Virginia's grants are divided into two phases, with the state paying $22,000 per job for the first 25,000 jobs, for a total of $550 million in grants to the company. For any additional jobs, the company would get $15,564 per employee. Amazon won't get paid until after the jobs are created.\n\nStephen Moret, head of the state's economic development agency, said the per-job figure is not even in the top 10 of what the state has previously paid to other companies. In current dollars, Virginia has paid as much as $80,000 per job for some economic development deals, he said.\n\nVirginia's per-job incentive is effectively only about a third of what Amazon is getting from New York, where Amazon is also planning a new 25,000 employee expansion.\n\nMoret said Virginia made a \"conscious decision\" not to try to lure Amazon with over-the-top cash grants but instead focus on a more comprehensive pitch.\n\nArlington county is also promising to give Amazon a share of its hotel tax, which it said would add up to $23 million over 15 years if Amazon meets its predicted job-creation targets.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHIGHER EDUCATION:\n\nA lynchpin of Virginia's bid to Amazon is the state's promises to double the number of students who graduate each year with bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science and related fields. The state plans to spend $375 million to boost the number of tech-related master's degrees at George Mason University and Virginia Tech, which is planning to open a $1 billion graduate campus near the new Amazon headquarters.\n\nState officials expect roughly half of Amazon's new jobs at the Virginia headquarters will be tech jobs.\n\nChristina Winn, director of business investment for Arlington's economic development office, said Virginia Tech's planned expansion is the key overlooked piece of the deal.\n\n\"It's going to be a catalyst for the whole region,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTRANSPORTATION:\n\nThe state is also promising to put up to $295 million into five transportation projects. They are a connector bridge from Crystal City to Reagan National Airport, improvements to a major thoroughfare, two new Metro station entrances \u2014 including to an as-yet-to-be built station \u2014 and expansion of transit service in the area. Local governments said they've committed to spend $570 million on a collection of projects that will directly benefit Amazon's new employees.\n\nVirginia also agreed to help Amazon build and operate a helipad at its new site at the company's expense.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHOUSING:\n\nThe Virginia Housing Development Agency plans to spend an extra $15 million a year on to promote affordable housing in areas affected by Amazon's new headquarters for the next five years, according to Gov. Ralph Northam's office. The quasi-governmental agency is funded through the sale of securities and loans to private investors.\n\nArlington and the city of Alexandria plan to use new revenues from Amazon to fund at least $15 million in the next decade to create and preserve 2,000 to 2,400 units of affordable housing.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEXTRAS:\n\nVirginia's contract with Amazon contains strict language on what the state can reveal through public records requests. Moret said the intent is to protect Amazon's proprietary information, not to circumvent the state's open records laws.\n\nThe state also promises to \"foster an innovative economy\" and help implement \"forward-looking regulatory frameworks\" that promote competition, new technologies and clean energy. Secretary of Finance Aubrey Layne said that clause of the contract was meant as a signal to innovative companies in all fields that Virginia wants to work with them.\n\n\"It's really saying that Virginia is moving forward,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Barakat contributed from Falls Church, Virginia."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: New details into Southwest's midair accident that killed a mother of 2", "description": "Investigators revealed more about the moments an engine ripped apart and a passenger was partially sucked out the plane's window.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/details-southwests-midair-accident-killed-mother-59203306", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/181114_wnt_kerley_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:52:45Z", "content": "Now Playing: Engine fire forces Southwest flight to return to airport Now Playing: Southwest flight forced to land due to cracked window Now Playing: Deadly military jet crash at Texas Air Force base Now Playing: Man dresses as woman to steal puppy: Police No\u2026 [+1209 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for New details into Southwest's midair accident that killed a mother of 2\n\nchilling new details after that deadly midair accident onboard a southwest passenger plane.

I kind of have to laugh at my younger self, but that was when my crush started. Reporter: Lewinsky recalls how she felt when a president paid attention to a white house intern. He, you know, paid a lot of attention to me. He spent time sort of standing there and held my hand longer than what he should have and gave what others have described as the full Bill Clinton. Reporter: In that new A&E docu-series, she explores what she was thinking, that led to what she calls her own poor decisions. She believes he was wrong, too. The moment we were actually in the back office for the first time, the truth is is that I think it meant more to me that someone who other people desired desired me. However wrong it was, however misguided, for who I was in that very moment, at 22 years old, that was how it felt. Reporter: Lewinsky now telling \"Vanity fair,\" \"An important part of moving forward is excavating, often painfully, what has gone before. I took the small, narrow sliver of a man I knew and mistook it for the whom.\" Lewinsky describes looking back at those 20-year-old images of her with the president saying, at the time, she was excited for all the wrong reasons.

I felt totally out of place in St. Louis, just like every teenager does. And it kind of was like this secret alter ego that I got to live out and build a career. And no one really knew about it back home.\u201d\n\nOver the next 11 years Kloss would become one of the most recognizable faces on the planet, gracing the runways of major designers like Oscar de la Renta, Christian Dior, Versace and Diane von Furstenberg.\n\nShe also served as global brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and starred in several major international campaigns for brands like adidas, Versace, Dior, Carolina Herrera and Swarovski\n\n\u201cI was going back and forth between, like, sitting in my chemistry class, getting on a plane that night right after school going to Paris, walking Dior Couture opening the show\u2026and then going back home and like needing to like still turn in my five paragraph essay,\u201d said Kloss. \u201cBut it was really amazing dual world and life that I lived and still live, I guess.\u201d\n\nClemens Bilan/Getty Images\n\nToday that \u201cdual world\u201d includes another passion -- coding. On the surface it\u2019s one that might seem unexpected, as the couture-clad super beauty doesn\u2019t necessarily fit the stereotype of a hoodie-wearing coder, but Kloss has had a love of math and science from the beginning.\n\nAs the daughter of an emergency room physician, she looked up to her father, fascinated by his ability to problem solve and help people using science.\n\n\u201cI definitely thought being a doctor would be my kind of career path. I always was really fascinated by science, by math and I loved the idea of being able to help people with a skill set,\u201d she said.\n\nKloss discovered her own love of coding by taking classes at The Flatiron School in Lower Manhattan. Her instructor and dean of the school, Avi Flombaum, said that she was a natural.\n\n\u201cI met Karlie, I was doing a class for two of my friends and they asked if she could join...She showed up on day one, really took to it and outperformed my two friends,\u201d Flombaum told ABC News\u2019 Rebecca Jarvis.\n\nAfter that first lesson in 2014, Kloss was hooked.\n\n\u201cThat whole week, and more and more, she started emailing me if we could spend time on the weekends coding and that sort of snowballed,\u201d Flombaum said.\n\nBut eventually, Kloss wanted to do more than just learn herself. She wanted to figure out a way to give other women the skill that she found so valuable. With the help of Flombaum, she started a scholarship giving 21 teenage women across the U.S. the opportunity to take the Flatiron School\u2019s two-week pre-college program coding class, the same one that Kloss took when she fell in love with coding.\n\n\u201cI have this audience of young women across the country around the world, and I really care about the message that I'm sending them both through my words and my actions. And I thought, you know what, I would love to offer them something more meaningful than just a picture backstage at a runway show.\u201d\n\nJust one year after starting her own coding journey, Kode With Klossy was born.\n\nToday the free two-week summer coding camp has grown to 50 camps across 25 cities across the U.S. girls ages 13 to 18 can apply to attend through the company\u2019s website and be placed in classes of 20 where they learn to code real-life apps.\n\nIt\u2019s not abnormal for Kloss to pop into one of the camps, and she\u2019s become a mentor for many of the young women who have been with the program since the start. \u201cNightline\u201d joined her for one of those visits at a camp in New York, where level 3 campers are learning Swift, the coding language used by Apple developers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing because I feel like I really have seen them grow so much, beyond just learning code...They\u2019ve been able to grow as humans. I think it\u2019s such an intense moment in life being in your teen years and high school and you\u2019re kind of figuring out so many things and I see these girls kind of come into their own power, come into their own confidence, and they realize all that could be possible in their lives, in their careers, and it\u2019s just so fun and amazing to watch. I get goose bumps, I really do. They\u2019re my little sisters.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nIn the beginning, the young coders first learn the basics of the new language and then collaborate to design and build a new app. They were in the final stages of creating applications targeted at real world problems when \u201cNightline\u201d stopped by. But it\u2019s not just the curriculum that these young coders love, it\u2019s the relationships they are building with other young women in technology.\n\nMany of the coders we spoke to said that the camps provide a supportive place to grow and thrive. Valeria Torres-Olivares, 18, began learning to code in her sophomore year of high school. But she said the past two summers she has spent at Kode With Klossy have \u201cbeen a rejuvenating experience having amazing girls to work with and talk about code with.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t feel comfortable asking your peers questions because most of the time they are male and most of the time, whether they are mean to you or not, they do make you feel like you are less than them,\u201d Torres-Olivares told ABC News\u2019 Rebecca Jarvis.\n\nMany of the female coders \u201cNightline\u201d met say they are outnumbered by their male counterparts at school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like three girls in the front row and then the rest of it is all guys. Basically feels like a guy\u2019s club. So being here feels like a safe space,\u201d 16-year-old camper Ivana said.\n\nSofia Ongele, 18, who started learning to code at the Kode With Klossy camp in 2016, added that one of her favorite things about the program is the network of women she can connect with to talk about coding. \u201cI could just hit up my girlfriends any time that I wanted to and be like, \u2018hey, help me out here.\u2019 So that was really great.\u201d\n\nWhen creating the camps it was important to Kloss to focus on women. Today, while women make up more than half of college-educated workers, they only make up 25 percent of those in STEM fields, according to the U.S. Department of State.\n\n\u201cThere are multiple problems too, I think, why more girls don't get excited about tech or see themselves in that industry. A -- barrier to entry of not having opportunities, not having a class to even take to learn the skills. And B -- what society tells us or the image that we see and I think we need more visibility around women in the industry and they exist.\u201d\n\nWith over 16 million followers across her social media platforms, Kloss is helping to increase the visibility around women in technology, showing that the stereotype surrounding STEM aren\u2019t real.\n\n\u201cEverybody expected me to be one thing, to be on the catwalks or in magazines...And so I definitely think a lot of people noticed when I started coming out and talking about my love of science and math and more nerdy passions,\u201d said Kloss. \u201cI think that me standing up and kind of identifying my nerdy passions has ignited that for so many other girls and that impact is something that really drives me to want to keep being true to who I am, and supporting other young women.\u201d\n\nWatch more from Karlie Kloss on \"Nightline\" tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET and hear more of her interview on the ABC News podcast, \u201cNo Limits with Rebecca Jarvis.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Trump endorses major sentencing reform legislation", "description": "The president hailed the prison and sentencing reforms as a bipartisan achievement.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/trump-endorses-major-sentencing-reform-legislation-59203814", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/181114_vod_orig_trump_first_step_prison_reform_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:29:02Z", "content": "Now Playing: Trump endorses major sentencing reform legislation Now Playing: The Briefing Room: Defense Secretary Mattis visits U.S.-Mexico border Now Playing: Sen.

President Donald Trump has called the Fed's rate hikes his \"biggest threat.\"\n\nThe Fed has the tools and the protections it needs to serve the public in a \"non-partisan, professional way,\" Powell said.\n\nNone of Powell's comments indicated the central bank would stray from expectations that at its December meeting it will hike rates for a fourth time this year. The Fed left rates unchanged at its meeting last week.\n\nPowell said the Fed is raising rates slowly in an attempt to avoid the mistake of hiking them either so quickly that it pushes the economy into a recession, or moving too slowly and allowing inflation to get out of control.\n\nThis gradual approach has translated into a total of eight quarter-point rate hikes since the Fed began raising rates in late 2015. Those came after seven years in which the Fed kept its key policy rate unchanged near zero in an effort to lift the country out of the deepest recession since the 1930s.\n\nThose hikes have pushed the Fed's key policy rate to a range of 2 to 2.25 percent. The Fed has signaled that it expects to raise rates one more time this year and three more times in 2019.\n\nDuring the recent turbulence in stock markets, Trump grew increasingly pointed in his criticism of the Fed's moves, saying they risked undoing his efforts to boost the economy with tax cuts and were not needed because inflation remains low.\n\nPowell said political criticism would not affect the Fed's policies.\n\n\"We have an important job that Congress has assigned. We have the tools to do it and we have the protections to do it,\" Powell said.\n\nHe also stressed that in his view \"our economy is in such a good place right now,\" citing low unemployment and strong growth.\n\nAsked what headwinds he saw, Powell said that the current global slowdown is a concern. He also noted expectations that the strong support the U.S. economy has received from the $1.5 trillion tax cut Trump pushed through Congress last December and a big boost in government spending will fade.\n\nThat could be happening in the next year or so, he said.\n\nPowell said that the effects of the Fed's gradual but steady rate hikes could also act to slow growth.\n\nAt another point, he was asked about the old Wall Street adage that bull markets don't die of old age but rather get killed by the Federal Reserve.\n\nPowell said that is not the Fed's aim. He said the central bank is trying to raise rates in a gradual way in order to extend the current expansion, now the second longest on record."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Trump aide departs West Wing after rebuke from first lady", "description": "Deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel is leaving the White House, one day after first lady Melania Trump's office issued an extraordinary statement calling for her dismissal", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-aide-departs-west-wing-rebuke-lady-59203307", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:21:59Z", "content": "Interested in Trump Administration?
