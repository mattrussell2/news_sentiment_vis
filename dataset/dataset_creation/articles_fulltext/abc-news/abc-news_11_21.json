Police said Wednesday that he had been killed , and authorities were working with anthropologists to try to recover his body from North Sentinel, in the Andaman Islands.\n\n\"Words cannot express the sadness we have experienced about this report,\" his family said in a statement posted on his Instagram account. \"He loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.\"\n\nVisits to the island are heavily restricted, which Chau knew, authorities said. Police arrested seven fishermen accused of helping him reach it, and Chau's family pleaded for their release, saying he acted \"on his own free will.\"\n\nChau, 26, was from southwestern Washington state, where he attended Vancouver Christian High School. He went on to graduate from Oral Roberts University, a Christian college in Oklahoma, in 2014, with a degree in health and exercise science. While there, he worked with the university's missions and outreach department.\n\n\"I have never known a more courageous, selfless, compassionate man and friend,\" said Bobby Parks, the department's former director. \"John lived and gave his life to share the love of Jesus with everyone.\"\n\nChau also worked with Parks' nonprofit, More Than a Game, a soccer program for disadvantaged children, including refugees. Chau traveled to the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq in 2014 to work with Syrian and Iraqi refugee youth, Parks said, and he worked with Burmese refugee children in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for several years.\n\nOn Father's Day last year, Chau noted on Instagram that his father came to the U.S. as a refugee during China's Cultural Revolution. He also documented his extensive travels, posting photos of climbing the peaks of the Cascade Range, scuba diving on previous trips to the Andaman Islands and fishing in Southern California.\n\nOne of Chau's friends, Casey Prince, 39, of Cape Town, South Africa, met the adventurer five years ago, when Chau traveled with members of the Oral Roberts soccer team to volunteer at a soccer development and social leadership program that Prince founded, Ubuntu Football Academy.\n\nSince then, Chau had been back to visit Prince and his family or tutor and coach boys in the program about four times. Most recently, he was there from mid-September to mid-October, Prince said.\n\nPrince described Chau as easy to like, kind, joyful and driven by twin passions: a love of the outdoors and fervent Christianity.\n\n\"He was an explorer at heart,\" Prince said. \"He loved creation and being out in it, I think having probably found and connected with God that way, and deeply so.\"\n\nPrince declined to discuss what Chau had told him about his plans for traveling in India or the islands, saying he wanted to focus on Chau's legacy. But he said Chau accepted the dangers that came with his adventures.\n\n\"If he was taking a risk, he was very aware of it,\" Prince said.\n\nIn a Q&A for the wilderness adventure website the Outbound Collective, Chau said he first fell in love with the outdoors as a child, when he read books like \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"The Sign of the Beaver,\" a tale of a white boy who befriends a Native American boy after being abandoned in a cabin in 18th century Maine.\n\nThe latter book \"inspired my brother and I to paint our faces with wild blackberry juice and tramp through our backyard with bows and spears we created from sticks,\" Chau said. \"Since then, the outdoors have been my home.\"\n\nAlex Burgdorfer, who lives in Eugene, Oregon, said he met Chau last year when the two went through a recertification course for wilderness first responders. The two hit it off because of their mutual interest in travel and hiking and had recently been trying to get together for a hiking trip in the Northwest.\n\n\"He was an inspiration for me,\" he said. \"His energy was pure. He gave you his full attention and his full thoughts.\"\n\nDuring the wilderness first-aid course, Burgdorfer recalled, Chau gave a short talk about treating snake bites in the wilderness, telling the group of his experience getting bitten by a rattlesnake and almost losing his leg.\n\nIt happened during one of the three seasons Chau lived alone in a cabin at Whiskeytown National Recreation Area in California, where he would be dispatched to wilderness emergencies. Burgdorfer said Chau had been standing near a river when he was bitten on the left ankle. Chau's Instagram feed displays his grotesquely swollen leg and says he spent several days in a hospital.\n\nChau had worked for the past two years leading backpacking trips to Mount Adams in southwest Washington state for incoming students at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, boss Will Symms said.\n\n\"He was always a great person to hang out and talk to,\" Symms said. \"He loved traveling and showing people the wonder of the things all around.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFlaccus reported from Portland, Oregon."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Genetic genealogy leads to arrest in 1973 cold case murder of 21-year-old woman", "description": "John Arthur Getreu, 74, was arrested at his home in Hayward, California, authorities said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/genetic-genealogy-leads-arrest-1973-cold-case-murder-59352366", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181121_vod_orig_coldcase_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T23:57:49Z", "content": "Now Playing: Investigators crack decades-old cold case murder Now Playing: Break in cold case murder after more than 3 decades Now Playing: 'Familial DNA' leads to cold-case arrest Now Playing: Genetic genealogy leads to arrest in 1973 cold case murder of 21-\u2026 [+1245 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Genetic genealogy leads to arrest in 1973 cold case murder of 21-year-old woman\n\nOkay.

The victim was the daughter of an Army chaplain, according to the station.\n\nSanta Clara Sheriff\n\nCold case investigators at the sheriff's office recently took another look at Perlov's murder and submitted \"numerous items of evidence for DNA examination,\" authorities said.\n\nIn July, authorities submitted an unknown male DNA profile found on the evidence of Perlov's murder to Parabon NanoLabs, a DNA technology company in Reston, Virginia, for analysis using the lab's Snapshot DNA Analysis Service, the release stated. The service \"produces a descriptive profile of the source of any human DNA sample,\" according to the company's website.\n\nGenetic genealogy helps \"to advance investigations when traditional DNA methods fail to produce a match,\" the sheriff's office said. The DNA is tested using \"innovative genetic analysis, sophisticated identification techniques and traditional genealogical methods to establish the relationship between an unknown subject and his/her known ancestors,\" according to the release.\n\nGoogle Maps Street View\n\nFirst, family trees of matches are constructed using genealogy databases, newspaper archives, public family trees, obituaries and other public records, and then \"descendancy research\" is employed to narrow down the possible identities of the suspect, authorities said.\n\nOther information, such as age, location and trait predictions are then used to narrow down a list of leads, which is then presented to law enforcement office.\n\nThat analysis led to Getreu being identified as a suspect in Perlov's murder, and DNA samples acquired directly from him will now be submitted for DNA testing, the sheriff's office said. He was booked into the Santa Clara County Jail without bail and has a hearing scheduled for Nov. 26, online jail records showed.\n\nIt is unclear if Getreu has retained an attorney.\n\nInvestigators will also work to determine whether Getreu is connected to other unsolved crimes, according to the sheriff's office."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Guatemalan ex-soldier gets 5,130 years for 1982 massacre", "description": "A Guatemalan court has sentenced an ex-soldier deported from the United States to 5,130 years for the 1982 massacre of 171 villagers", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/guatemalan-soldier-5130-years-1982-massacre-59352299", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T23:39:55Z", "content": "A Guatemalan court has sentenced an ex-soldier deported from the United States to 5,130 years for the 1982 massacre of 171 villagers.

Only her father, Otto Frank, survived.\n\n\"Of course we did not change the hiding place itself \u2014 the annex \u2014 which is the most authentic place where Anne Frank was in hiding and where she wrote the diary,\" Leopold said.\n\nIn a major overhaul spanning two years, the museum got a new entrance and changes to rooms including the darkened space that displays the iconic books that made up Anne's diary.\n\nThe museum also has revamped the way it tells the story of the Frank family, and by extension the Nazi persecution of Jews.\n\n\"What we tried to do is ... use the family history as kind of a window onto a larger history,\" said Tom Brink, the museum's head of publications and presentations.\n\nThat larger history includes the Nazi-occupied Dutch capital during the war \"and, of course, European history because all Europe was affected by the Nazi rule,\" Brink said.\n\nAs well as the physical changes, the museum now has an audio tour which pieces together fragments from the diary, family stories and historical perspective. That allowed curators to keep physical exhibits sparse while still explaining the Franks' story and putting it in historical context.\n\n\"We wanted to preserve the character of the house, which is very much its emptiness,\" said Leopold. \"I think its emptiness is probably the most powerful feature of the Anne Frank House.\"\n\nFor example, a room that served as the office for Anne's father's company used to contain office furnishings. Now it is virtually empty with just a few photos on the wall. One shows a group of Jewish men in Amsterdam kneeling, their hands on their heads, watched over by a Nazi soldier carrying a rifle.\n\nOn another wall is a map drawn up by Amsterdam civil servants for the city's Nazi occupiers with black dots representing the places where Jews lived.\n\nThe museum remained open throughout the renovations. Dutch King Willem-Alexander will formally open the refurbished landmark on Thursday.\n\nAfter the war, Otto Frank had his daughter's diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into more than 70 languages.

The backlash over Big Tech's collection of personal data offers fresh hope to a number of little-known search engines that promise to protect user privacy, such as Britain's Mojeek, France's Qwant, Unbubble in Germany and Swisscows, which say they don't track user data, filter results or show \"behavioral\" ads.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAs Ghosn heads for Nissan exit, Renault merger hopes fade\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 The arrest of Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn could extinguish any remaining hopes for a merger with key shareholder Renault, which the Japanese company's CEO has publicly opposed.

But the wind was pushing the plume away from the community of 101 people.\n\n\"It's a big, black, ugly cloud,\" lifelong resident Victoria Tague said of the ash, which later slipped behind a cloud cover.\n\nAlaska Volcano Observatory scientists said that overnight emissions from Veniaminof generated an ash plume up to 15,000 feet (4,572 meters). The cloud drifted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the southeast.\n\nThe ash emissions prompted an aviation warning. Observatory geophysicist Dave Schneider said that level of emissions would affect mostly smaller aircraft. Ash above 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) could threaten jet airplanes.\n\nVeniaminof is 480 miles (772 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage on the Alaska Peninsula. It became active again in early September.\n\nAbout a month ago, Perryville was dusted by drifting ash. When people saw Wednesday's distant ash cloud from the volcano, they were \"a little alarmed,\" said Gerald Kosbruk, president of community's the tribal government.\n\n\"This is the most ash I've seen come out of it,\" he said.\n\nPeople also heard rumbling noises coming from the volcano overnight, he said.\n\nKosbruk and others got on the VHF radio and recommended locals get face masks ready and stock up on water in case the wind shifts direction.\n\nVeniaminof didn't keep people from holiday preparations, however. Around noon, people began heading toward the village school, where a community Thanksgiving potluck was being held, Kosbruk said.\n\nThe volcano erupted for several months in 2013. Other recent eruptions occurred in 2005 and between 1993 and 1995.\n\nPerryville residents are used to living near a volcano. The village itself was founded in 1912 as a refuge for Alutiiq people displaced by the eruption of another volcano.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Rachel D'Oro at https://twitter.com/rdoro"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "The Latest: visiting remote island was man's last adventure", "description": "The Latest: Kayaking to a remote Indian island proved an adventure too far for an avid American outdoorsman and Christian missionary", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-relatives-forgive-tribesmen-killed-american-59351691", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_e613dc3985634532905738acec58ac0d_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T23:01:25Z", "content": "The Latest on the death of an American adventurer and missionary who was killed by an isolated Indian tribe (all times local): 4:30 a.m. John Allen Chau spent summers alone in a California cabin as a wilderness emergency responder.

A team of police and forest department officials used a coast guard boat to visit the island Wednesday and another visit was planned Thursday.\n\nThe Sentinelese people are highly resistant to outsiders and the government tightly restricts visits to the island.

Anthony List, lauded the U.S. abortion rate as \"half of what it was in 1980,\" a time period after Roe v. Wade, when abortion measures were at their highest, according to CDC data.\n\n\u201cAny decline of this size and duration has many causes. Among the most salient: a higher percentage of women today decide to carry an unexpected pregnancy to term, teenagers are less sexually active and with fewer partners, pro-life views are more prevalent among the rising generation than they were 40 years ago, and states continue to adopt legislation that defies the radical message of legal abortion until birth embodied in Roe v. Wade,\" Donovan said in a statement.\n\nAbortion, a key cultural issue for voters, is increasingly a focus for conservatives looking to increase restrictions through judicial nominations in the aftermath of the midterm elections, which bolstered the Republican majority in the Senate. President Donald Trump has already moved his picks for the lower federal court through the chamber at a faster pace than his recent predecessors.\n\nDr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood, an abortion rights group, was also supportive of the low numbers but criticized the Trump administration for \"placing restrictions on what we know works -- birth control.\"\n\n\u201cThe United States has been experiencing a downward trend in unintended pregnancy which has led to a 30-year low in the overall rate of unintended pregnancies; an all-time low in the rate of unintended pregnancy among teens; and the lowest rate of abortion since Roe v. Wade was decided \u2014 all largely due to people\u2019s increased access to effective and affordable birth control,\" Wen said in a statement. \u201cIf we want to continue to reduce the rate of unintended pregnancy in this country, we must ensure that every person has access to the full range of birth control methods, along with accurate, nonjudgmental information and sex education.\"\n\nThe CDC report is not comprehensive across all 50 states, though it includes 49 reporting areas including Washington and New York City, and experts continue to suggest different ways to interpret the numbers.

Mary Alice parks here we're talking food she. Yeah. I have. Are some fantastic cook so we will show our favorite recipes. At route when the meal at the end of the show stick around and you want him my favorite. Odd and meanwhile though some big news breaking just a few minutes ago people Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court John Roberts. Making an extraordinary statement. In direct response to something president trump said yesterday this is unusual because. As we all know the chief justices tended to stay away from politics stay away from certainly responding directly to the president in of the United States but here's what. So quit struck him that he had to respond this is president trump yesterday responding to the ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision against. His asylum there. What you got in the ninth circuit and it's a disgrace and I'm gonna put it a major complaint. Because you cannot win if you're us a case in the ninth circuit because every case no matter where it as they file it practically I mean practically. For all intents and purposes they've violated what twelve the ninth circuit. As woods and Obama judge. An outside you watch. It's not yet I happen. Like this anymore. In Obama judge certainly a slam at the ninth circuit that prompted chief Justice Roberts today in an interview with the Associated Press to have this to say he said we do not have Obama judges are trump judges bush judges are Clinton judges. What we do have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their best to do equal right to those appearing before them that independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for. Simply extraordinary to see these Supreme Court Chief Justice come out like this he didn't have to weigh in Lana. Well. To the eight partially so interesting Justice Roberts had. Made part of his. His public persona one of reserve and dignity and trying to makes more than that it maintained throughout. The court he even. Even when some other justices have. I have yeah. Managed to go into the foray of politics and some of the political discourse Roberts has kept himself. More on more as as bad. Independent juror switch he even now is he saying that under the court's legacy almost never let me tell you. Yeah right he's the chief and he is responsible in some ways for setting the tone. Com and it's still interesting to that he wants to separate the court. From what we see as -- the increasing colonization of that branch of government and that is actually supposed to be. Is he says defenders of the constitution. Nine not representatives of constituent. And this is something he has spoken a lot about just most recently a month ago after the bruising battle over the newest Supreme Court justice for Kavanagh here's a little bit from the Chief Justice. On exactly what one of us talked about. I have great respect for our public officials. After all they speak for the people. And that commands a certain degree of humility from those in which a bus in the judicial branch. Who do not we do not speak for the people but we speak for the constitution. Our role is very clear. We are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United States. And ensure that the political branches act within them. That job obviously requires. Independence from the political branches. And of course the constitution was set up. Where the judiciary would be at shack on the administration a check. On the White House as that is remarkable there's going back to fundamentals here are sort of fundamentals of American service systems of government. That the president would lash out against judiciary incident doing any self reflection. Perhaps the reason that that those policy proposals continue to get overturned in the court. Is that they are and amending fundamentally illegal or. Unconstitutional Maurer president Trump's actions indeed and potentially involvement in the Muller probe could end up before this court makes this than usual as well. And got an answer it isn't something distance and -- is that we're talking about one step below the Supreme Court right. In the midst of the ninth circuit in the currents had something extraordinary amount SoundBite where he's going to look into it. What does it mean that he's going to look into what the ninth circuit is doing as the executive branch he is supposed to be. Separate from the decision that are coming from any any of the legislative branch. And the idea that he is going to look into a I think. For people who are. Who are strict division separation of power of folks that's up frightening pretty F. Course it's not just the issue of the independence of the judiciary that the president has tested but he's also push that seemed boundary when it comes to the Department of Justice. To our legal system law enforcement there is another major headline on that front. Overnight in the New York Times the times reporting that the president just this spring few months ago ordered. The prosecution of Hillary Clinton his former rival of course and former FBI director James Conley. He was he was brushed back by White House counsel dom again Mary Alice and again like Roberts has been somewhat of an institutional us a defender of of of this branch of government says Mr. President you simply cannot do that you cannot words Justice Department to prosecute your enemy. Scene according to those reports can easily warned the president that the prosecution of political enemies. I'm would circuit undermines or the bedrock of democracy in that that our history has. Has shown time and again that we have certain that a prime a free and fair elections and move the political process along and then prosecutions are used as political tools. Let's bring our White House correspondent terror Paul Mary was with the president right now. Who has begun his Thanksgiving vacation down in Florida Terry great to see you there hosting a beautiful day and more alive though. You've been talking to White House officials about they're over reaction to this times report you know Don again and his staff. Give us your take on on what this report really signals about the president. We'll the president often pleasantly talks about prosecuting Hillary claim saying James call me. There's a huge part of his campaign. If he continued to talk about lock her up at the rally is so it's not really a surprise. That in private White House officials little me many times he's mention the prospect. Prosecuting electing Clinton he almost sees it as a campaign promise that he hasn't been able to put fell. Campaign promise he hasn't been able to vote though he certainly didn't fulfill that he didn't obviously order. Does Justice Department Tut to prosecute these women in the New York comes out you wanna financing you and I think that's what's striking many members of congress Mary how she can do justice and did look. Into the issue that we Knapp and four for a number of years that congress and Seau and special investigations and tons of hearings. And an reports issued by a Republican appointed members of the Justice Department. Who came to conclusions that there was nothing there to prosecute. And Tara it does seem like this latest story this episode. Which is a flash and along sog that would of this president challenging. Some of the norms and conventions. Is another sign of his growing infatuation with executive power. Party's executive orders to be just among the other things that he's were taken a liking to. Yes he certainly testing the limits of executive power. You'll see a lot of that is well in terms of executive privilege on me getting to that new congressional term. You see a lot of energy coming from the house Democrats trying to subpoena. There and documents communications on the White House he'll try at as much as he can to fight for executive privilege and those fights may end up in the Supreme Court which brings as back to our last topic and you know a lot of people are looking. Torre is I've chief Justice Roberts to wonder if he eight truly nonpartisan judge how well he. How only decide any cases where it's the president. Merced the congress on what he should hand over when need investigations really heat up and there's subpoenas that likely are thought out. In the Supreme Court. Carroll might everyone what the president wanted it to investigate Hillary Clinton for an in the timing of that coinciding with the time. The Yvonne good truck that revelation about the trump was using her personal email account. Is it curious said that this report is coming out now. Frightening president Chavez always made the argument that he thought that the clintons were criminals it's not just Hillary Clinton for her use of then I emails. He attacked her for her and that cover aids a strike them of the servers now these emails have gotten this thing. You know he's also made attacks against. Her husband as well yes dated an interesting timing why he would want to draw more attention to that outing when his own daughter. Was accused of improperly. Using emails by using up Friday email account for a White House business. You know it you gotta wonder if this cricket among that's what he that's why he doesn't Hillary Clinton cricket Hillary because of the email but he said that. All agree enough have been documented unlike Hillary Clinton emails which are not no longer I'm accessible and that if there question -- him a moment. Tartar primary force down in now and morrow a lot of Florida thank you so much Tara have a good Thanksgiving we'll see on the other side. Our guys the other big story that is ski continue to cause reverberations in this town is the president's statements about Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia yesterday pretty extraordinary in my. Of the murder of Schumacher showed he writer with the Washington Post the president trying to shut down any talk. Of penalties against Saudi Arabia for that basically boils down to two words in his view jobs. And oil he tweeted just a little while ago this morning about oil prices here on this holiday weekend much slower that is a true statement about 54 dollars a barrel we fact checked that that's about right. Lowest in a long time not so sure that's due directly Mary Alice to the actions of Saudi Arabia as much as it is. Burgeoning supply rate now worldwide. And then there's a lot of things that impact of oil prices consumers noting too that they'll present have been tracking down for quite some time. But. You know I think you're copyright the president has taken this crisis and made it's just purely about transactions with Saudi Arabia. Has send that what matters most to him is that business relationship between his government and the Saudi government. And that matters more in his eyes men in the light of this American journalist and there. And we should saline was did you continue this fact check and in Europe. Been tracking this as well the president not just talking with oil prices but the jobs that the US business relationship with Saudi Arabia has been creating. He's used some pretty inflated numbers as a hundred billion dollar and ten billion dollars and arms deals between the US and Saudi. 450000. Jobs he American jobs he says will be created. That's simply doesn't hold water. Those numbers are. It perhaps. Best characterizes wishful thinking by the president and I think even once true. There is something that's worth us. Briefly putting up hot button on end and there are lots of conservative allies of the president that are doing the same think pink and it's not add the point at which you you make the case as president of the United States that you do not care alternately. Whether or not Smith in the Saudi royal family with behind the murder of this writer. At them with the Washington Post if there's enough money behind it you're essentially telling the world. That the United States values. Our integrity. Is up for sale and I and that is something that is very concerning and so. It one one of the president's partners and so many other things senator Lindsey Graham has come out saying that. That in the senate for their part and conservatives in the senate are going to continue. Unto you hold Saudi Arabia accountable for that killing and small can show he and the president's desire events you to say how good these jobs are and how much money could potentially coming to the United States are. Is besides got back check absolutely irrelevant. And certainly. Wii remote dig a little bit more into that though the president is on the other side of this getting a little bit of backing from his Defense Secretary would just a little while ago spoke to reporters backing the president up. On its position on Saudi Arabia he didn't do it on camera but we do have some of the quotes take a look he said on the crucial he affair presidents don't always get the freedom to work with unblemished. Partners in all things he went on to say that he didn't think the CIA assessment had been fully bait he said what's going on and Yemen of course the Saudi Warren Yemen. In is unacceptable needs to be ended as soon as possible we're gonna deal with the saudis if you want to deal with the saudis he said and end this war. You've got to deal with them. Yeah very pragmatic and that's true of absolutely if you look at. And at history there have been lots of deals cut live. Some pretty bad actors in and one can even say arguably. That bad a lot of the negotiations with North Korea fall into that same bucket. Quiet there is something different about making it so public and so over that it is tied to the finances. Of the United States that make the president's comments right now different and we just don't know how the rest of the world is going to respond on the president's given level and Green Day. And let's go over the White House our Jordan Phelps is standing by she's been reporting on this story. Talking to White House officials there Jordan. A let's pick up where Mary Alice left off there are what are you hearing from White House officials about how this policy how this position from the president. Came about why did we see this statement this week when we did. And what's behind all this. Dads have and it is what it is that's a president can't sank yesterday and I kind of sums up. The position in the White House is taking on as they want to move on from this story out to gather this has been an inconvenient storyline for this White House. Asked for a long time the president his son in on Jared Kushner have a very close relationship. Out with the Saudi royal family had this Saudi Arabia weighs in the first place at commissioner try to take the president ride. I and so they want to keep this strong alliance going and and what's really striking here is diving is that the president is saying like we will never now. At me he did meet me he didn't bite the press is really on an island here as we've been cleaning out. The CIA has at concluded basically that he played some role we note that. You know take the contrast with. With Lindsey Graham is really striking south the president really on his own out here I wanting to keep in doing business with with Saudi Arabia. And we know that he'll meet Mohammed and some on the crown prince in writers just about a week's time down in Buenos Aires the G-20 summit Mary Alice. I had that congress is coming back there are expected right out of the gate next week to take some action their number bills on the floor or. Riley was talking about really moving forward with some heavy sanctions against the Saudi government and it's just it's it's isn't it this administration that so. I'm used to point fingers and placing blame you know earlier this week or ten of those fire and then as far as I'm California I'm labeled on the fires. And the president blaming them forest brush and force his management and now here's one story where congress is saying. Could we please point to singer Clint please back up the intelligence. Community that's point a finger and that's exactly and there are. Event is in large part you can do both things you can stay friends a Saudi Arabia you can also you and hold them accountable with some sanctions we'll see if they can actually do that of course the president would have to sign. In any potentially. Anything speaking of Capitol Hill and dad the democratic committee majority coming in in the house side at least a big development happening just in the last 24 hours be. One and only challenger two oh who would be House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Has bowed out she has now apparently dropped her challenge the speaker it's Marcia fudge you see there of Ohio. Had brokered a deal what Nancy Pelosi. This is pretty significant guys because. With with her vowing out there's released no one laughed despite that list of sixteen house Democrats who signed the letter send their poster. It is a big blow to that group they were really hoping that she would throw her name officially in the race for those sixteen Democrats have any chance at really foiling. The speakership of Nancy Pelosi a potential speakership there they have to have another name to vote for the math doesn't work if they only vote present or they don't show up steam and I'll have to coalesced behind some other name. That's solar plants to offer a different name me he force a second ballot create some syndrome and some chaos there. Potentially encouraging someone else to run in the last few moments but right now. No one stepping in line just remind folks at home why we're so fixated on the speaker race and Nancy Pelosi in a note out an icon in American politics that. That position speaker of the house is actually quite powerful it's quite powerful and it is going to be absolutely. Instrumental. When we're looking at the presidential election in 20/20 remember Nancy Pelosi her name was invoked as. Kind of bogey man out on the campaign trail particularly. Behind the president but also by a by other Republicans who were saying. If you vote for a Democrat you're going to be handing the gavel to Nancy Pelosi. And so some Democrats a sixteen wanted to open to try and head off that argument. And remember she had faced up a really a significant challenge to her leadership after they lost the house in the last election in. In 2016. At that point it really seem like. Democrats were mobilizing. To potentially offer up a challengers Nancy Pelosi and it is just falling apart right now. Though I was I was speaking with. You try is most recent congressman that democratic congress and congressman Ben make Adams just a little bit ago he is one of those sixteen names. With so many other is falling by the wayside. Saying that they are now going to support Pelosi would he change his mind especially since. He represents as a Democrat probably the most conservative. District in the nation. And he says he is still holding firm to the idea that they need new leadership in the democratic me. She with a rubber hits the road when the when the vote is actually held the caucus the Democratic Caucus will vote for they are picked to be speaker. Just next week after Thanksgiving and then give the full vote. On the house for happens in January were just also learning now that. Very prominent Democrat electorate Alexander Costa Cortez who had shown some willingness to support Nancy Pelosi is now more forcefully coming out from the progressive wing at a party saying. She's she'd be okay with the speaker Nancy Pelosi. And there's similarity between Alexander pastor Croat tanks and rush advisory just talking about in both instances. They got certain Gordon's forward backing the speaker polar potentials near blows his bid for the speakership. Nancy Pelosi send that she would sat out. Select committee's special Clinton committees to work on the projects that matter a lots in the hunt select committee on energy independence and global warming. And another one Marcia Ferris wheel chair on voting rights security and and how Chalmers a passion of hers and we're seeing that kind of let's make a deal congress I don't taking place between now and January. I think runs everybody in the nation in the wrong light if your not and a girl can be bought with your. I'd melt away purse and and you hear. Somebody say absolutely we need change and then they can they're gonna get a chairmanship so now there are supporting. Hello see that's that's sort of thing that I think. People. From Iowa like myself don't always think. Sound it's gonna back Friday on race to watch to the finish in the Democratic Party continues next week for sure. Meanwhile over on the senate side of the equation here we have a little bit more drama the one and only. I'd debate in the Mississippi senate race the one race that still undecided from the trade team in terms happened last night. Consider Republicans Cyndi Hyde Smith Democrat Mike SP who's running to be the first African American senator from Mississippi since reconstruction. They face stop and center stage is you guys know full well as this issue of race in some incendiary comments that Cindy hired Smith made about a public hanging. Here's what she had to say about that and Mike espy's response. It never banned. I've never been our book to anyone I've always tried to help everyone. I also recognize. That this coming it was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me and political weapon. These are nothing but arsenal and political gain that might come. That's the type of politics Mississippi hand aren't sick and tired. As did comments were lack. You know it came out of your mouth. And I don't know with a no harm but we all know what can imagine now. And it went viral you know we've been the first three minutes around the world. It's so it's called upstate harm. If given out stayed up another black guy that we don't need is just rejuvenating dose stereotypes. You know that we don't need anymore. Where else at the end of the day whether it was well intended to whether it was a joke these were no accident these comments about public hanging in Mississippi. Throughout the civil rights era had the most publicly genes of any state in the country so this is really struck a nerve in that state.

Oh boy looks like a felon who's just been arrested by the police when his arms spread face to the floor but. Come tomorrow. These giant character balloons are going to be. Up in the air to the delight of the three and a half million spectators that are going to be lining the route and we have met some of these folks who have come in but really from all over but these happy folks are from Philadelphia. Great to see you guys welcome to New York. What do you think of going here witness of the balloons coming to life unbelievable it's not so big that but they're giants. And any favorite character that you're going to witness chase. Down from Paul patrolled. Yeah. Yes and that's gonna ask how old you are to be like and often are always seem a little beyond your pop patrol years but hundreds let me see.

Seeing the Smart ones always have friends. Along the route for this Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade guys thanks enjoy the parade and enjoy these balloons coming straight to life. Now there is a question of how high these balloons are going to fly because. A wind. He is going to be an issue. The balloons have only been grounded once in the whole history of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and that was back in 1971. When it was just far too windy and they're mindful that on some of these tree lined streets along the road. They're just too many things getting in the way they don't want to do damage to the balloon sort of the people below. And so it's going to be up to the meteorologists in real time to monitor the wind speeds and in the police department and the balloon handlers to decide. Whether these things can fly at full height or whether they're going to have to come down a little bit lower and ABC news meteorologist Dan Pak is with us all right Dan. Give us the word of these balloons going to be able to fly tomorrow. Well Aaron it's certainly going to be cold and windy it looks like it was going to be a closer call with the wind speeds yesterday. Now we Hannity today it looks like those winds will be a little bit lower still gusty so we're think in those balloons will be flying tomorrow morning. First though we have the Arctic air mass right on New York city's doorstep let's take a look we do have that colder air now moving in. In New York City get ready the next few hours you're gonna hear drastic change the wind gusts may be some flurries and in those temperatures tumbling Aaron. By 10 PM this evening temperatures gonna drop about twenty degrees. I mean that's that's awfully cold for the spectators are going to be out here now the good rule of thumb here is if the winds. Below its 23 miles per hour. Consistently or if there are gusts in excess of 34 miles per hour. The balloons have to come down otherwise they can adjust the height. So they may not for the sword full height but they can at least slide any idea yet down on on what the wind speed is going to be tomorrow. Yeah it looks like the strongest winds because this Arctic air coming in love it quicker than first anticipated will be overnight so they're gonna want to elect take extra precaution overnight as they continue to blow those balloons up. As we look into tomorrow morning. Which shall bitterly cold six degrees it's gonna feel like sustained winds about fourteen to eighteen gust 25 to thirty select the start of the parade around. I'm nine AA and it will be close but then throughout the parade the winds gradually diminish so. It looks like overall we're gonna stay below those thresholds but you're gonna they're gonna want to take those extra precautions especially near those trees and buildings. A bundle up for sure if you're coming out to the parade and then of course they're going to be monitoring the and a monitors for the wind speed to decide in real time. How high these balloons can can fly it's ABC news meteorologist Dan that. Monitoring with the odds and we've Macy's and new York city police department. For the winds and the weather for the 92 Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. Now even though that the wind may get in the way that's not stopping folks here. From blowing up these balloons and you can see. That there are crowds are coming from all over. To witness these balloons coming to life it is something of a rite of passage.

Donziger was suspended for misconduct. And it should have mentioned that an international arbitration tribunal in the Hague ruled in August that the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron obtained in 2011 by plaintiffs represented by a legal team led by Donziger violated Chevron's rights. It ruled the judgment should not be recognized or enforced because parts of it were \"corruptly ghostwritten\" in return for the promise of a bribe. The tribunal did not, however, absolve Chevron of potential liability for pollution.\n\nA corrected version of the story is below:\n\nLawyer who battled Chevron may get chance to defend himself\n\nA legal referee says a New York attorney who won a landmark oil pollution judgment against Chevron in Ecuador only to have his law license suspended at home should not be disbarred without a chance to defend himself\n\nBy FRANK BAJAK\n\nAssociated Press\n\nA New York attorney who won a landmark oil pollution judgment against Chevron in Ecuador's court system only to have his law license suspended at home for professional misconduct never got a fair hearing and should be allowed to defend himself against disbarment, a legal referee has ruled.\n\nThe decision involves Steven Donziger, who led a legal team representing Ecuadoreans trying to get Chevron to pay for environmental damage caused to a rainforest by Texaco during its operation of an oil consortium from 1972 to 1990.\n\nThe legal campaign begun in 1993 was ultimately successful in Ecuador. A court there ordered Chevron to pay $9.5 billion. But in 2014, a judge in New York, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, invalidated the Ecuador judgment, deeming it was obtained through fraud, bribery, witness tampering and other misconduct.\n\nIn July, a New York State appeals court suspended Donziger without a hearing based on Kaplan's ruling that the attorney's Ecuador team submitted bogus evidence, ghostwrote a court-appointed expert's report and promised $500,000 to the Ecuadorean judge to rule in their favor.\n\nDonziger fought those findings and denies he offered or paid bribes.\n\nA court-appointed referee, John R. Horan, ruled on Nov. 8 that Donziger deserves a hearing to defend himself. He also questioned whether Kaplan violated Donziger's constitutional right to due process.\n\nKaplan effectively \"created a criminal indictment\" and tried Donziger for conspiracy, Horan said.\n\n\"It is doubtful that if an indictment in the same terms had been brought by the United States Attorney, (Donziger) would have elected to have a trial by a single judge and would have waived his right to a trial by jury,\" the referee wrote.\n\nHoran said he would grant Donziger two days beginning Dec. 4 to argue why he should not be disbarred.\n\nThe chief attorney for the New York State grievance committee trying the case, Jorge Dopico, filed a motion on Nov. 15 arguing that Horan had no right to re-examine Kaplan's ruling and asking a state appeals court to cancel the Dec. 4 hearing.\n\nA spokeswoman for Dopico said he does not comment on disciplinary cases. The referee, Horan, said he could not discuss the case because the court had marked it confidential.\n\nThe state court in New York suspended Donziger for \"serious professional misconduct which immediately threatens the public interest\" four years after Kaplan's ruling. The District of Columbia also suspended his law license.\n\nUnder New York's disbarment procedure, the court renders a verdict after receiving the recommendation of the court-appointed referee, who is not a court employee.\n\nMartin Garbus, a renowned constitutional lawyer representing Donziger in the case, said its importance goes far beyond the particulars of the environmental dispute because of the precedent it could set for all attorneys in the country.\n\n\"I have never seen anything like this before,\" he said. \"We never in American history have seen a case where the judge turns it into a disbarment proceeding.\"\n\n\"They're trying to break him in half,\" Garbus said of Chevron's treatment of Donziger, painting him as a solitary David against a deep-pocketed corporate Goliath.\n\nChevron did not directly respond to comment on Garbus' claim. It did note, however, that the Kaplan judgment was final in the U.S. given that it was upheld by an appeals court and that the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case.\n\nDonziger said he will appeal, if necessary, to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nChevron became involved in the Ecuador pollution dispute by buying Texaco. Chevron has long argued that a 1998 agreement Texaco signed with Ecuador after a $40 million cleanup absolves it of liability and says that Ecuador's state-run oil company is responsible for \"any existing environmental and social conditions in the area.\"\n\nThe Ecuadorean plaintiffs say the cleanup was a sham and didn't exempt third-party claims.\n\nAn international arbitration tribunal in the Hague ruled in August that the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron obtained in 2011 by plaintiffs represented by a legal team led by Donziger violated Chevron's rights. It ruled the judgment should not be recognized or enforced because parts of it were \"corruptly ghostwritten\" in return for the promise of a bribe. The tribunal did not, however, absolve Chevron of potential liability for pollution.\n\nChevron insists there is no merit to the allegations of environmental harm."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Soo Youn", "title": "Inside the Supreme Economy: Streetwear, phones, bots and side hustles", "description": "Yes, that magic marker is $40.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/inside-supreme-economy-streetwear-phones-bots-side-hustles/story?id=59316142", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/supreme-clothing-01-file-gty-jef-181120_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:56:07Z", "content": "Every Thursday morning at 11:00 a.m., Marlon Smith watches his computer or his phone, waiting for the newest Supreme products to drop.

Now, Smith is also a part of the tribe of diehard fans (\"hypebeasts\") and entrepreneurs who make extraordinary profits in the Supreme economy of calculated sales, hype and exponential resale value.\n\n\"It was a lifestyle and then it became a part-time job, and I can make a good income,\" Smith told ABC News. The 24-year-old is studying business administration at LaGuardia Community College in Queens, New York and works as a doorman in a co-op building near Brooklyn's Prospect Park.\n\nWelcome to the hype economy, in which Supreme reigns...supreme.\n\nOn Tuesday, online shopping and research platform Lyst named Supreme the world's most powerful logo in its 2018 fashion report.\n\n\"Supreme\u2019s iconic red box logo is fashion\u2019s hottest status symbol. From the 1,000 percent [spike in] search frenzy when sell-out collaborations launch, to the sky-high resale value of Supreme-branded pieces, Supreme\u2019s was the most wanted logo of 2018,\" according to the Lyst report.\n\nFormer British child actor James Jebbia started Supreme as a skateboarder brand in New York City in 1994, and it's made its way through skateboarding, hip-hop, sneaker and hipster culture ever since. Supreme is best known for its collaborations with premium mainstream brands like Louis Vuitton, North Face, Vans, BAPE, Gucci and Nike.\n\nBut its clout reaches beyond clothes and accessories. For example, there's nothing remarkable about this red Pilot marker stamped with the brand's trademark red-and-white box logo, which goes for $40. (But it does.) Some may find it unfathomable that anyone can sell a Supreme logo-embossed brick for $260. Not to mention the frenzy that drove the price of $5.50 transit card in New York City to as high as $1,000 on eBay.\n\nStadium Goods\n\nEnter the hypebeast bubble: every Thursday, people like Smith, along with five of his like-minded friends, get ready to pounce and eventually cash in. These savvy middlemen invest in the resale markup, rather than the actual items they buy. Take the Supreme-North Face collaboration jacket Smith bought for around $300 a few months ago. He turned it around, selling it for $1,200, and now it's worth even more. That's a 400 percent markup.\n\n\"The streetwear market is really about scarcity. Whether it's Jordans or Yeezy or Supreme, it's about not having enough supply to meet demand,\" Matt Powell, senior industry adviser for sports at The NPD Group and self-proclaimed \"sneakerologist,\" told ABC News.\n\n\"The scarcer the product, the higher multiple for resale. For instance, two weeks ago, Adidas released a Yeezy 700 that's actually reselling below the original price. The suggested price was $300, and they were selling for $275 the last time I looked on Stockx,\" Powell said.\n\nClaudio Lavenia/Getty Images\n\nEquipped with bots that they have installed as apps into their laptops and phones, Smith and his friends virtually queue up. They spend about $20 to install the bots on their phones or $300 to have it on their computers. This software will even check the \"I am not a robot\" box that's common on retail sites.\n\nThe group spreads out the purchase since Supreme only allows customers to buy one of each item. They use different credit cards and even pay some people about $50 to ship the goods to their homes since using the same shipping address can expose multiple purchases, Smith said.\n\nAlthough it's not officially advertised, fans have an idea of what's going to be available by checking social media accounts, such as the Instagram pages \"Supreme Leaks News\" or \"Supcommunity,\" to get a feel for what could happen. In the handful of cities where Supreme has actual brick-and-mortar stores lines of hoodie-clad buyers snake around blocks.\n\nIt's hard to know how long the hypebeast premium will last, and that was the point Hasan Minaj made on an episode of his Netflix show \"Patriot Act\" on Sunday. He dissected the brand's appeal, and delved into the estimated $500 million investment by The Carlyle Group, which raised Supreme's valuation to $1 billion. The private equity group has long had positions in defense companies, but Minaj focused on its holdings in Wesco, an electronics company which supplies BAE Systems, a British defense company.\n\nSupreme is a cultural phenomenon built on hype, but how much longer can it last? https://t.co/nRmlVdwG2Y \u2014 Hasan Minhaj (@hasanminhaj) November 18, 2018\n\n\"Wesco and BAE support a fighter jet called the Typhoon, which is used by the Saudis to bomb Yemen,\" Minhaj told the show's audience, adding, \"This is a company that profits off of war and obesity. Why are they trying to sell Supreme fanny packs to dudes with man buns?\"\n\nThe Carlyle Group declined to comment.\n\nThe bigger threat to the brand would be if its patina of exclusivity were to fade.\n\n\"Now that they're owned by private equity there's going to be pressure to grow. And growth and scarcity are opposite market releases,\" Powell said. If you look at the last Yeezy release, there's no fever to buy and no resale product afterward.\"\n\nSmith said that on Thanksgiving he will still hit up the Supreme site to see what's on offer. As he talked on the phone with ABC News, he stepped into a Dunkin' Donuts, where he saw one of his customers. After seeing the sneakers Smith was wearing, the customer asked Smith to pick up a pair for him to buy.\n\n\"Everywhere I go, I usually bump into someone who asks me to get him something,\" Smith said. \"He has small feet though, they don't have his size.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme x Timberland 2018 World Hiker Front Country Boot will drop online and in the Manhattan, Brooklyn, Los Angeles, London and Paris stores. On Saturday, the shoes will drop in Japan.\n\nSmith is sitting this one out, he said. \"You have to be smart. Supreme x Timberland is not very limited \u2014 depends on how big the hype is.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons inflate ahead of windy, chilly holiday", "description": "The Upper West Side is bustling this evening, as balloons are prepared for their parade route tomorrow morning in New York City.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-balloons-inflate-ahead-windy-59350752", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181121_wabc_macysballoons_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:55:01Z", "content": "Now Playing: Historic cold forecast for Thanksgiving Now Playing: Thanksgiving by the numbers: average American consumes 4,500 calories on Thanksgiving Now Playing: Gas prices plunge ahead of Thanksgiving Now Playing: 2018 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Previ\u2026 [+1266 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons inflate ahead of windy, chilly holiday\n\nEyewitness News reporter Michelle child what is live at the inflation of the balloons a Manhattan's upper west side with a look at last minute preparations Michelle.

He had won his seat just two years before in a special election. Now he was flying from Washington to West Springfield, Mass., for the state's Democratic convention, where he was to be renominated by acclamation. But June 19 was an important day, with the Senate passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and it was evening before he could leave Washington.\n\nPlay\n\nJoining him on the flight were a fellow senator, the Indiana Democrat Birch Bayh, and his wife Marvella. Kennedy's legislative aide, Edward Moss, came along too. At the controls of the plane, a small twin-engine Aero Commander 680, was pilot Edwin Zimny.\n\nAs they headed north, the weather turned murky.

Shortly after 11 p.m., Zimny tried to make an approach, flying on instruments.\n\nThen the plane went into a dive.\n\n'A Terrific Impact'\n\n\"I was watching the altimeter and I saw it drop from 1,100 feet to 600 feet,\" Kennedy later told investigators from the Civil Aeronautics Board. \"It was just like a toboggan ride, right along the tops of the trees for a few seconds. Then there was a terrific impact into a tree.\"\n\nThe plane crashed in an orchard three miles short of the runway. Birch and Marvella Bayh were not seriously hurt, but Moss and Zimny would die overnight from their injuries.\n\nKennedy had broken three vertabrae and two ribs, and had a collapsed lung. Birch Bayh dragged him free of the wreckage.\n\nIt may have been their positions in the plane that determined each person's fate. The Bayhs, sitting in the rear of the small plane, fared best. Moss and Zimny were up front. Kennedy was in the middle, in a rear-facing seat.\n\nHe would spend five months in the hospital -- five important months, as it turned out.\n\n\"He got to think about what he wanted to be as a senator,\" said Adam Clymer, a veteran newspaper reporter who is the author of \"Edward M. Kennedy: A Biography.\"\n\nKennedy, confined in a special brace so that his broken back could heal, had time to read the books he had skipped in college, and to get tutorials from Harvard professors who came to visit.\n\nHow Ted Kennedy Cheated Death\n\nStaffers set up an office in a room at the Boston hospital to which he was moved -- and from there, they helped him run his re-election campaign, sending out releases, among other things, to let people know how he would have voted on pieces of legislation if he had been on the Senate floor. His then-wife Joan worked the campaign trail on his behalf.\n\nIn a campaign commercial archived by the John F. Kennedy Library, Ted Kennedy appears in a hospital bed, reading. Then the camera looks straight down on him, and he speaks with a shy smile.\n\n\"Well, I'm coming along now,\" he says. \"The doctors estimate that I'll be out of the hospital around Christmas time; I'm planning on Thanksgiving.\"\n\nThen he gives a campaign pitch: \"We must continue this effort to build a better Massachusetts, a stronger America, a world at peace. ... I want to be a part of that effort.\"\n\nIn Pain For Life\n\nHe won easily, and he left New England Baptist Hospital on Dec. 16 after a pre-dawn condolence call to the family of Edward Moss. News accounts of the time noted that he walked without help, though he wore a back brace and crutches were at the ready if he needed them.\n\nBut several biographers say his damaged back gave him pain for the rest of his life. And the experience was apparently food for thought. John was dead. His eldest brother, Joe Kennedy Jr., and his sister Kathleen Kennedy had both been killed in air crashes. He had come close.\n\nOther events in his life would certainly loom larger: the assassination of his brother Robert in 1968, the Chappaquiddick incident in 1969, his failed run for the White House in 1980. But if there was a Kennedy curse, Ted had been spared it that time.\n\n\"He hadn't, as a junior senator, really done anything,\" said Clymer. \"When he came back, he did a lot.\"\n\nClymer found a quote Ted Kennedy gave to Good Housekeeping magazine in 1965 about his slow recovery from the plane crash:\n\n\"I never thought the time was lost,\" he said. \"I tried to put my hours to good use. I had a lot of time to think about what was important and what was not and about what I wanted to do with my life. I think I gained something from those six months that will be valuable the rest of my life.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Rejected by family, gay athlete thankful for other support", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

When her mother came upon photos of Scheck and her girlfriend on social media, she said, her parents demanded she return home to the Rochester suburbs and attend counseling \u2014 or be disowned by the family.\n\n\"Because you disgust me,\" she said her mother texted.\n\nWhen Emily Scheck stayed put in Buffalo to continue working toward her business degree as a student-athlete, her parents followed through on their promise, she said, right down to depositing her childhood belongings and birth certificate in her parked car and leaving with the license plates, since they were no longer paying the insurance.\n\n\"At the start, it was definitely tough,\" Scheck told Outsports. \"I was lucky to be in preseason the first couple of weeks because coach could get us meals in the dining hall.\"\n\nBut it was clear that her jobs at a supermarket and through college work-study weren't enough to pay her school and living expenses, so her roommate set up a GoFundMe online campaign with the goal of raising $5,000. The amount was quickly exceeded.\n\nThen came a new challenge. Scheck was told by the college's National Collegiate Athletic Association compliance officer that she was breaking NCAA rules. In order to keep the donations, Scheck said, she was faced with leaving the cross-country team.\n\nThe college offered to try to work with the NCAA to find another option, she said, but there were no guarantees.\n\nWith her story gaining attention, the NCAA last week said Scheck could retain her eligibility and, under monitoring from the school, continue to accept donations for living and educational expenses.\n\n\"NCAA rules and waiver precedent allow a school to assist a student-athlete with a fundraiser after a significant life event occurs,\" the organization said in a Nov. 16 statement.\n\n\"She is a member of the Canisius family and we will do whatever we can to assist her,\" the college responded.\n\nOn Tuesday, Scheck said she would stop accepting donations because she had received more than anyone expected \u2014 $100,000 from more than 2,500 donors.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone who showed their love and support in this difficult time,\" she said in a statement issued through the college. \"The positive outreach has been unbelievable.\"\n\nTimothy Scheck said the family has apologized for the harsh messages and said comments about disowning their daughter were meant to pressure her to return home. When the parents insisted on counseling, they did not mean conversion therapy, he told The Buffalo News .\n\n\"It's a private family matter,\" he said. \"We love our daughter. We accept Emily.\"\n\nHe could not be reached for further comment. A home phone listing for the family could not be located this week.\n\nEmily Scheck said that this Thanksgiving, she is \"grateful for everyone in my life who have continuously been there for me.\"\n\nHer statement encouraged supporters to give to LGBT organizations to help others who are struggling. It ended: \"Love is love.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "6 killed in Haiti after police say govt car loses control", "description": "A Haitian government car has gone out of control into a group of people, killing at least six and further inflaming unrest in a capital wracked by violent protests", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/killed-haiti-police-govt-car-loses-control-59350377", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_8242cd5766f1402aa11e3ca7769b2acc_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:41:46Z", "content": "A Haiti an government car went out of control into a group of people on Wednesday, killing at least six and further inflaming unrest in a capital wracked by violent protests.

Add Immigration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Immigration news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday the White House has given him explicit authority to use military troops to protect Customs and Border Protection personnel, with lethal force if necessary, at the southwest border.\n\nThis could, under certain circumstances, mean directing troops to temporarily detain migrants in the event of disorder or violence against border patrol agents. \"This is minutes -- not even hours\" of potential detention, Mattis said, suggesting that he was not planning to use the military to operate migrant detention camps.\n\n\"We'll keep you posted on any new missions and any new numbers of troops as those decisions are made,\" he said.\n\nThe mission thus far for the approximately 5,800 active-duty troops in the border area has been mainly to lay barbed wire and other barriers along the border and to transport border patrol personnel. Mattis has stressed the need to keep the military away from civilian law enforcement roles such as arrests, which are forbidden under the Posse Comitatus Act. The law prohibits the federal government from using the armed forces in a domestic police role, except in cases and under circumstances specifically authorized by the Constitution or Congress.\n\nThe basis for the expanded legal authorities for Mattis is a belief by the Trump administration that the caravans of Central American migrants, whose numbers include many families with children, moving toward the U.S. border pose a potential security threat to the border patrol.\n\nOn Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited a San Diego Pacific Coast beach to see up close newly installed razor wire wrapped around a towering border wall that cuts across the sand. She said there were as many as 500 criminals and gang member in the groups heading northward, though she refused to answer questions about how they were identified or what crimes they had committed.\n\nMattis emphasized that he would use his expanded authorities only in response to a specific, detailed request from Nielsen, and that none has yet been made.\n\n\"I now have the authority to do more. Now we'll see what she asks me for,\" he said.\n\nMattis was adamant that the military will remain within its legal limits.\n\n\"We are not doing law enforcement,\" he told reporters at the Pentagon. \"We do not have arrest authority.\" He noted that National Guard troops under state control are also involved at the border, and he said the governors of those states could give them arrest authority. He said there are about 2,100 National Guard troops involved.\n\nMattis said that as of Wednesday there were 5,764 active-duty troops performing support missions along the border in Texas, Arizona and California. The number changes frequently. Just a day earlier, the Pentagon said in a report to Congress that there about 5,900 troop involved; at other times the Pentagon has put the number at 5,800.\n\nMattis said the instruction he received Tuesday was signed by President Donald Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly. Asked by a reporter what legal authority Kelly has to issue such an instruction to the Pentagon chief, Mattis replied, \"He has the authority to do what the president tells him to do.\"\n\nIt its report to Congress on Tuesday the Pentagon estimated the cost of the mission at $72 million through Dec. 15, when the mission is scheduled to end. It said the National Guard's work, which began in April, has so far cost $138 million. Mattis said he was certain the $72 million figure would go up, but he did not forecast any other total."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "How major US stock indexes fared Wednesday", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The verdict comes months after Swartz was acquitted of second-degree murder by another jury that had deadlocked on manslaughter charges, allowing prosecutors to pursue the case again.\n\n\"My client is very relieved. He has had to live with the burden of this case hanging over his head for years. He is glad that it is finally over,\" Swartz's attorney, Sean Chapman, said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nOutside the courthouse, a small group of activists protested the verdict, and one man was detained, media outlets reported.\n\nThe protest grew later in the day as scores of demonstrators shut down an intersection, snarling traffic in downtown and prompting authorities to briefly close several freeway ramps.\n\nOne sign protesters carried said, \"Abolish Border Patrol,\" while another read, \"No justice, no peace\" in both English and Spanish.\n\n\"We fully respect the jury's decision, and we thank every member of the jury for the time and attention given to this trial,\" Elizabeth A. Strange, first assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Arizona, said in a statement. \"This was a difficult case, and I commend the trial team and law enforcement officers who assisted in the prosecution.\"\n\nBorder Patrol agents are rarely criminally charged for using force. But the killing of 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez sparked outrage on both sides of the border and came at a time when the agency was increasingly scrutinized for its use of force.\n\nProsecutors said Swartz was frustrated over repeated encounters with people on the Mexico side of the border fence who throw rocks at agents to distract them from smugglers. They say he lost his cool and fatally shot Elena Rodriguez. Swartz fired about 16 rounds, and the boy was hit at least 10 times in the back and head.\n\nSwartz has said he was following his training and defending himself and other law enforcement officers from rocks, which he said could be deadly.\n\nProsecutors acknowledge that Elena Rodriguez was throwing rocks at agents while two smugglers made their way back to Mexico, but they said that wasn't justification for taking his life.\n\nChapman said Elena Rodriguez endangered the lives of the agents and a police officer who was on scene.\n\nThe verdict comes as President Donald Trump has deployed troops to the border to support U.S. authorities in response to a migrant caravan from Central America. The troops have been given authority to protect Border Patrol agents and other personnel, even though there have been no instances of violence against U.S. authorities.\n\nSwartz still faces a civil rights lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the teen's mother.\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office said prosecutors haven't decided whether to try Swartz again on the voluntary manslaughter charge."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "California raises more than $800 million in carbon auction", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Here's what you should know before you sit down for dinner.\n\nWHAT LETTUCE OUTBREAK?\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. health officials issued an unusually broad warning against all types of romaine lettuce amid an E. coli outbreak. They asked restaurants and grocers to stop selling it, people to stop eating it and everyone to throw it all out.\n\nThirty-two illnesses in 11 states have been linked to romaine. Canada also was affected, with 18 illnesses in Ontario and Quebec. No deaths have been reported.\n\nWASN'T THERE ALREADY A ROMAINE OUTBREAK THIS YEAR?\n\nYes. The strain of E. coli in the current outbreak differs from the one linked to romaine earlier this year that sickened about 200 people and killed five. But it appears similar to the strain identified in a 2017 outbreak that happened around the same time of year.\n\nThat outbreak was linked to \"leafy greens,\" but a specific supplier or vegetable was never identified in the U.S.\n\nThis time, officials were able to issue an alert earlier and specifically warn against romaine because of information collected through interviews with people who got sick, said Laura Gieraltowski, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nARE VEGETABLES CAUSING MORE FOOD POISONING?\n\nImproved detection may be driving up the number of outbreaks tied to produce. But the way food is produced is another consideration.\n\nTimothy Lytton, a professor of law at Georgia State University, noted that large cattle feeding lots could be a contributing factor.\n\nWHAT DO COWS HAVE TO DO WITH E. COLI GETTING INTO LETTUCE?\n\nHuge numbers of cows produce large quantities of animal waste. And bacteria from cattle feces can migrate into the water used to irrigate produce fields, Lytton said.\n\nIn fact, tainted irrigation water was identified as a likely source of this year's previous E. coli outbreak linked to romaine from the Yuma, Arizona, region.\n\nWHAT'S BEING DONE?\n\nAfter the Yuma outbreak, growers in California and Arizona increased the buffer zones between animal lots and produce fields, from 400 feet to 1,200 feet. Teressa Lopez, an administrator with the Arizona Leafy Green Marketing Agreement, also noted that growers in the state started treating water that runs near animal lots. The treatment, which kills pathogens, is used on water that is going to be used on produce.\n\nIS MORE REGULATION COMING?\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has new rules to step up the safety of produce, but the implementation is staggered and began just recently. The agency has said inspections won't start until next year.\n\nSarah Sorscher of the Center for Science in the Public Interest noted the importance of measures such as testing irrigation water. But a water-testing requirement has been contested and postponed, given the limited availability of tests that can specifically detect the harmful types of E. coli. Ultimately, that rule may not be implemented, Sorscher said.\n\nWHY CAN'T I JUST WASH MY ROMAINE?\n\nWashing doesn't kill germs like the heat from cooking does. That's why health officials are warning against all romaine.\n\nAccording to a 2013 U.S. government report , leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach are the biggest source of food poisoning.\n\n\"Any product that we don't have a cooking step is a bigger issue,\" said Martin Wiedmann, a professor of food safety at Cornell.\n\nTHEN WHEN CAN I HAVE SALAD AGAIN?\n\nIt's not clear when it will be OK to eat romaine again. Public health officials would want to be able to identify the source of the contamination or see the reported illnesses stop. Romaine has a shelf life of 21 days.\n\nRomaine sold in the U.S. comes from different regions at different times of year. So while the romaine lettuce linked to the E. coli outbreak earlier this year was from Arizona, romaine lettuce on shelves now is mostly from California, regulators said.\n\nHarvesting just recently began shifting back to southern California and Arizona, though most of that product has not started shipping, according to Lopez of the Arizona Leafy Green Marketing Agreement. She said suppliers were asked to withdraw products until health officials are confident the pipeline is clear of contaminated romaine.\n\nWHAT ABOUT TURKEY?\n\nBesides the romaine outbreak, there's a long-running widespread salmonella outbreak linked to raw turkey in the U.S.\n\nRaw meat and poultry is allowed to have salmonella because it's assumed that people will cook it. That's why regulators aren't telling people to avoid it, they're just reminding people to properly handle and cook their holiday birds.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Actors don't seem that interesting to me as a musician. And yet that's just the deal.\"\n\nHilton has managed to straddle the gap between professions since he burst onto the scene in 2005 at 19 playing Elvis in \"Walk the Line\" opposite Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. He later combined music and acting by joining the \"One Tree Hill\" cast for several seasons, starting in season two.\n\nBoth sides of Hilton's talents are available this winter. The music part is his new album \"City on Fire\" out in January and the acting part will be when he reconnects with some \"One Tree Hill\" stars for the Lifetime TV movie \" The Christmas Contract ,\" which comes out Thursday, his 35th birthday.\n\nThe TV movie won't be a terrible stretch \u2014 he'll play a character named Tyler Hilton who shows up to play a few songs, including \" Don't Feel Like Christmas \" and a dark, moody bluesy one from his new CD called \"Get Down.\" The film is an original story that features series regulars Hilarie Burton, Robert Buckley, Danneel Ackles and Antwon Tanner.\n\n\"'One Tree Hill' ended up being the biggest thing that I've done,\" he said. \"It's affected people in such a crazy way. And even though some of the other movies I've been in have won awards and been more prestigious, there's something about that show that really got into the pop culture psyche.\"\n\nHe's also excited for fans to hear his new music, a more authentic sonic representation of what interests him, namely everything from bluegrass to flamenco. He spent a frustrating 10 years with Warner Bros. Records before charting his own course.\n\n\"I think they saw a tall guy with blue eyes and they kept trying to hammer me into like a pop direction. And I wanted to make everyone stoked,\" he said.\n\n\"I listen to this record now and I'm so happy.

I would give this record as a Christmas gift.\"\n\nIt's an impressive album with varied song styles, including the searing rock of the title song, the romantic \"When I See You, I See Home,\" and the country-ish \"Overtime.\" He wrote it while filming two failed TV pilots. \"All of a sudden this music is just coming out because I'm not thinking about it,\" he said.\n\nA cool video for the CD's title track was made by someone very close to Hilton \u2014 his wife, the actress and director Megan Park. She calls him an \"old soul\" who has lately found freedom and is doing his best work.\n\n\"He's gone through such a transformation as a person in the last five years and I think he let go of a lot of preconceptions and labels put on him and the type of music he thought he had to put out,\" she said. \"He's gotten back to the roots of why he got into music.\"\n\nHilton may have played a jerk on \"One Tree Hill,\" but he's charming and self-depreciating in person. He grew up in a musical family adoring Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters but didn't look the part. \"There's nothing bluesy about a 6-foot-4, lanky tall white guy from Palm Springs, California, the golf capital of the world,\" he jokes.\n\nFunny stories seem to pour out of him, like the time he lived on Tylor Swift's houseboat in Nashville. \"Whoever's in control is writing the strangest story for me imaginable,\" he said, laughing.\n\nHe ended up under one of TayTay's roofs after she reached out as a 15-year-old to say she was a fan and invited him to be in one of her videos. \"She was automatically different right from the get go. I was like, 'This girl is a genius,'\" he said. Years later, her family offered him a home when he moved to Nashville.\n\nHis big TV break came when it was suggested he go on \"One Tree Hill\" during its second season to sing a song and say a few lines. He quickly bonded with the young cast and stuck around until the show concluded in 2012.\n\nNew episodes of \"One Tree Hill\" may not be being made but the series has found new audiences on Netflix and then Hulu. The actors stay in touch: \"It's like every year we have a reunion with people you went to college with. It's really cool.\"\n\nHe and Park met on the set of the Robert Downey Jr. film \"Charlie Bartlett\" and they convinced \"Gone Girl\" actress and family friend Missi Pyle to officiate their 2015 wedding.\n\nHis music may have led to acting or his acting fuels his music, but Hilton isn't ready to abandon either: \"Truth is, I love both and I've just decided to pursue both because it's like something I really love doing so I've kept at it.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Judith Graham | Kaiser Health News", "title": "Check your medical records for dangerous errors, experts warn", "description": "In the worst-case scenario, an incorrect diagnosis, scan or lab result may have been inserted into a record, raising the possibility of inappropriate medical evaluation.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/check-medical-records-dangerous-errors-experts-warn/story?id=59345651", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/files-gty-er-181121_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:12:00Z", "content": "This story is from Kaiser Health News.

It had his name on it but identified him as a 53-year-old woman.\n\nIn another instance, the records that accompanied deBronkart\u2019s mother to a rehabilitation center after a hip replacement incorrectly identified her as having an underactive thyroid when in fact she had an overactive thyroid. DeBronkart\u2019s sisters, who asked to look at their mother\u2019s chart, discovered the mistake and had it fixed on the spot, so she wouldn\u2019t get potentially harmful medications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to realize how easy it is for mistakes to get into the system and for nobody to know it. And that can cause downstream harm,\u201d deBronkart said.The law that guarantees your right to review your medical record, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, offers some recourse: If you think you\u2019ve discovered an error in your medical record, you have the right to ask for a correction. (For more information about how to obtain your record, see my earlier column here.)\n\nStart by asking your doctor or hospital if they have a form (either a paper or electronic version) you should use to submit a suggested change.\n\nA simple error such as a wrong phone number can be corrected by drawing a thin line through the material and writing a suggested change in the margins or making an electronic note. A more complicated error such as incorrect description of your symptoms or a diagnosis that you\u2019re contesting may require a brief statement from you explaining what material in the record is wrong, why and how it should be altered.\n\nPhysicians and hospitals are required to respond in writing within 60 days, with the possibility of a 30-day extension. (Some states set shorter deadlines.) But medical providers are not obligated to accept your request. If you receive a rejection, you have the right to add another statement contesting this decision to your medical record. You can also file a complaint with the government office that oversees HIPAA or a state agency that licenses physicians.\n\nDevin O\u2019Brien, senior counsel with The Doctors Company, the largest physician-owned medical malpractice firm in the U.S., notes that rejections can be warranted when facts or medical judgments are in question. An example might be a patient who wants a doctor\u2019s notes about potentially excessive opioid use eliminated from the record. \u201cThe patient may say I don\u2019t have a problem, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but the physician may think the patient has an issue,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nAnother example might be a patient who wants a diagnosis eliminated from a medical record, because it might compromise her ability to get insurance coverage. That wouldn\u2019t be an acceptable reason for making a change, experts said.\n\nFor more information about correcting errors in medical records, see this guide to getting and using your medical record from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, this explainer from patient advocate Trisha Torrey, and these descriptions of your HIPAA rights from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and the Center for Democracy & Technology.\n\nWe\u2019re eager to hear from readers about questions you\u2019d like answered, problems you\u2019ve been having with your care and advice you need in dealing with the health care system.

The weather has been very cooperative,\" said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein. \"It's busy, but this Sunday and Monday will be busier travel days for us.\"\n\nThe military again opened some of its airspace to airline flights during the holiday-travel period \u2014 last Saturday through Wednesday, and again the upcoming Saturday through Monday. The practice began about a decade ago. A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said 39,000 flights took advantage of the extra airspace last year.\n\nHoliday revelers traveling by car were able to take advantage of a big decline in gasoline prices caused by lower oil prices. The nationwide average pump price on Wednesday was $2.60 a gallon, down 25 cents from a month ago.\n\nGasBuddy, a price-comparison site, said prices were under $2 a gallon in nine states, with several others hovering just above that mark.\n\n\"We will see the national average go lower because there are still drops in the pipeline,\" said GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan. He estimated that U.S. motorists are spending $100 million less each day on gasoline than they were a month ago.\n\nAAA is forecasting the busiest Thanksgiving travel period since 2005. Most people who will travel at least 50 miles from home are going by car, according to the auto club. AAA spokesman Robert Sinclair credited a strong economy and rising consumer confidence, \"and when we have a little time built into our schedules, we take advantage of it.\"\n\nMuch of the country was blessed with mild weather, but that was expected to change in some areas. Rain was moving in along the West Coast, contributing to delays in places including San Francisco, where the FAA said arriving flights were running nearly two hours late on average.\n\nIn the Northeast, frigid temperatures were forecast for Thanksgiving Day, although the holiday itself is traditionally a light travel day.\n\nAside from the weather, American Airlines airport kiosks were knocked offline briefly on Wednesday morning. The airline said no flights were delayed because of the problem, which appeared to be fixed by midday.\n\nThe day before Thanksgiving was a more difficult travel day in the past. Many Americans who travel over the holiday now start earlier and return later, spreading crowds over several days.\n\nThe busiest day ever for Transportation Security Administration airport screeners was the Sunday after Thanksgiving in 2004, but seven of the top 10 days occurred during summer, including five days this past June."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Review: Game not over in 'Ralph Breaks the Internet'", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Reilly, who among us wouldn't root for the latter? Leave us IMDb.com and a few podcasts, John, but by all means, go smashy-smashy with the rest.\n\nHaving liberated arcade game characters from their rigidly ordained roles in 2012's \"Wreck-it Ralph,\" its sequel, \"Ralph Breaks the Internet,\" sends our charmingly lopsided duo \u2014 the hulking, big-fisted Ralph (Reilly) and the glitchy pipsqueak candy-colored racer Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) \u2014 into that expansive netherworld where clickbait lurks and pop-ups proliferate.\n\nFor a pair of pixelated beings whose existence has heretofore been limited to a handful of video games, they're decidedly not in Kansas anymore. The web of \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" is a strictly PG-rated, sanitized version; there are no dark turns down 4chan alleys or face-to-faces with Infowars conspiracies. But that doesn't mean there aren't cruel truths that Ralph must confront in cyberspace \u2014 none more than when a crestfallen Ralph sees the responses to his popular viral video. Never read the comments.\n\nIn trading Qbert jokes for eBay ones, \"Ralph Breaks the Internet,\" directed by Rich Moore and Phil Johnston, does more than shift the puns. If \"Wreck-it Ralph\" was a nostalgic \"Toy Story\"-like trip into '80s arcade games, \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" is more current. It's ultimately about male-controlling impulses run amok.\n\nLife inside the arcade has gotten repetitive for Vanellope, who's tired of winning the same old rainbow-colored races in her game, Sugar Rush. But while the video-game characters are convening in their Grand Central-like terminal, a new plug labeled \"WiFi\" arrives above. \"It's either Wiffle ball or an arranged marriage,\" says Ralph. Soon after, the impending unplugging of Sugar Rush (due to a malfunction) prompts a kind of migrant crisis. All of the game's characters flee before they get trapped in the shutdown and need new, adoptive homes.\n\nVanellope crashes with Ralph, but he can see his friend \u2014 and their friendship is indeed endearing \u2014 is feeling lost. Ralph resolves to journey into the internet to purchase the replacement part that will save Vanellope's game. Crawling through the router, they speed through optical cables and arrive in an infinite, glittering cityscape populated by towers of tech (Amazon, Google) and byzantine byways of zipping digital avatars.\n\nIt's an idealized vision of the internet. There are no trolling Russian bots here, just some distracting ads and a quite charming, bespectacled search engine (voiced by Alan Tudyk) that will try to finish every sentence. The pair's initial plans prove more complicated once they discover the online world isn't just a game, but a place dictated by real money. To raise the money, Ralph quickly turns video star, churning out meme-inspired videos with the help of a Buzztube executive (Taraji P. Henson). Many, especially those in newsrooms, will watch with jealousy at just how quickly Ralph is able to monetize clicks.\n\nThere are other adventures, too. Vanellope finds a far grimier, \"Grand Theft Auto\"-like racing game called Slaughter Race, a realm presided over by a stylish driver voiced by Gal Gadot. It's hardly the kind of game that anyone would imagine a good fit for a petite ponytailed pixie. But she thrills to the more grown-up racing world, eager to test her skills. Online, you can find your niche.\n\nOther cyber doors are less appealing. In one self-referential diversion, Vanellope walks into a room of Disney princesses. Jasmine, Moana, Cinderella, Ariel, Snow White, Belle and others are sitting around, waiting to participate in an online quiz: \"Which Disney princess are you?\" They all speak a little similarly (and they note, none have mothers) in a segue of self-deprecation for Disney that's both a welcome gag and, for the media behemoth, false modesty.\n\nThere's much that's clever in \"Ralph Breaks the Internet,\" but it's the film's heart \u2014 thanks to Reilly and Silverman's voice work and easy rapport \u2014 that has made them more than a whiz-bang graphical blast. These are fragile and sensitive protagonists trying to be themselves in a world of pop-culture-prescribed roles. In \"Ralph Breaks the Internet,\" it's Ralph who has to do some soul-searching.\n\nThe movie isn't always quite up to the task. It would be better if it went further and wrestled more with the online world than used it as another bits and bytes background. Really, it doesn't quite live up to the title. Ralph could have done more damage.\n\n\"Ralph Breaks the Internet,\" a Disney release, is rated PG for some action and rude humor. Running time: 112 minutes.

That's a key measure of health for a retailer. Online sales also surged. Target reported a 49 percent increase in online sales, which was better than expected.\n\nBut shares of Target and the parent of TJ Maxx took a hit after reporting that their third-quarter profit results were squeezed by increased expenses. T.J. Maxx cited higher freight costs, while Target highlighted higher e-commerce costs. Kohl's delivered strong third-quarter results, but it issued a cautious annual profit forecast. Best Buy, which has been on a winning streak, couldn't win over investors even as it boosted its annual earnings guidance.\n\n\"There are clearly a bit of two worlds. Everything we're seeing about the consumer is very positive,\" Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly told reporters on a conference call Tuesday. \"Consumer confidence is at an all-time high...unemployment is incredibly low, wages are going up.\"\n\nBut, he cautioned, \"The financial market can be a different picture and we'll see how it evolves.\"\n\nThe National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade group, is expecting holiday retail sales in November and December \u2014 excluding automobiles, gasoline and restaurants \u2014 to increase as much as 4.8 percent over 2017 for a total of $720.89 billion. The sales growth marks a slowdown from last year's 5.3 percent, which was the largest gain since 2010.\n\nBut the figure is still healthy and is the latest indication that the retail industry is far from an apocalypse that some feared only a year ago and a half ago. The growth forecast, which includes online sales, is slower than the average annual increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years.\n\nAdobe Analytics, which analyzes visits to retail websites, predicts a 15 percent increase in online sales to $124.1 billion in online sales for November and December.\n\nStill, retailers are facing a host of challenges. They're grappling with an even stronger Amazon from a year ago, higher labor costs and surging online sales that are putting more pressure on their profit margins. Retailers are also monitoring the impact on tariffs that have been slapped on a variety of different goods imported from China, although holiday merchandise will likely not be affected because they're already in U.S. warehouses. Any price increases could come starting early 2019.\n\nBut so far, there seems to be no warning signs that the strong economic times will end anytime soon.\n\n\"We continue to see a healthy consumer environment as we enter the fourth quarter,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said on a call with reporters. He noted there's no indication that the consumer environment is slowing down.\n\nRetailers have been plowing money into their businesses, remodeling stores while trying to speed up online deliveries.\n\nEarly last year, Target began a three-year plan to invest $7 billion in its stores and online operations. Kohl's has been sprucing up its merchandise and is now allowing shoppers to return goods purchased through Amazon at 100 stores.\n\nBest Buy has shown resilience in the face of increasing online competition by allowing shoppers to test new technology, and offering speedier delivery options. It's also been expanding its tech support services, including a free service in a couple hundred markets where salespeople visit customers at home to make recommendations on TVs, setup and more.\n\nTJX, which operates T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods, has been bolstering its fashion business, resulting in a hefty 7 percent increase in consolidated same-store sales in the quarter compared to a year ago. But higher freight costs took a bite out of profits.\n\nDespite the snag, \"TJX's overall success underlines the fact that even in a strong economy where disposable incomes are rising, consumers still enjoy getting a bargain,\" wrote Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, a retail research firm.\n\nMeanwhile, Gap Inc., which runs the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains, reported earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations. But its sales at established stores were flat, weighed by a 7 percent drop at its namesake stores.\n\n\"We are clearly not satisfied with the performance of Gap brand,\" said CEO Art Peck. \"We know this iconic brand is important to customers, and we are committed to taking the bold and necessary steps to ensure that it delivers value to shareholders.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Aaron Katersky and Bopha Phorn", "title": "'Not your usual suspect': Police find hawk broke through woman's window, not burglar", "description": "New York police were looking for a suspect, but what they found was a hawk.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/usual-suspect-york-city-police-find-hawk-broke/story?id=59340159", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/hawk-02-ht-jc-181121_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:12:47Z", "content": "New York police were looking for a suspect, but what they found was a hawk.

Apple spent more than $80 billion on share buybacks through the first three quarters of this year. Chipmaker Qualcomm also bet big on its own stock, shelling out $21.2 billion in the third quarter.\n\n\"Companies have adopted buybacks as an option when they have excess capital and nothing better to do with it,\" says Michael Schoonover, portfolio manager of the Catalyst Buyback Strategy Fund.\n\nBuybacks, in which companies purchase their own shares and retire them, are popular with investors because fewer shares outstanding lifts earnings per share, the most watched barometer of corporate success.\n\nThe sweeping tax law passed by the GOP-led Congress last year gave Corporate America incentive to give its share prices a boost.\n\nThe legislation reduced the tax rate on corporations to 21 percent from 35 percent, leaving many companies flush with savings. Those that had been keeping cash overseas also got a break on the tax hit for bringing those profits back into the U.S. As a result, many company boards took steps to authorize or boost existing share buyback programs.\n\nCompany buyback authorizations, which clear the way for spending a certain amount on share repurchases over a specific time span, usually several years, also marked a milestone this year. The amount of share buybacks that company boards authorized this year is now at around $950 billion, an all-time high that eclipses the previous record of $813 billion in 2015, Schoonover said.\n\nThe ramp-up in buybacks this year has also allowed companies to repurchase their stock at lower prices, beginning with the sell-off in February that knocked the S&P 500 into a correction, or a decline of 10 percent or more from its peak at the time in January.\n\n\"These companies that made all these massive authorizations this year picked a pretty good time to go out there and start buying their stock on the market dip,\" Schoonover said.\n\nThe market eventually recovered, reaching a new high in September. The wave of selling since October, however, opens the door for companies to once again buy back shares at a discount.\n\n\"This is probably going to be the first year where companies authorize more than $1 trillion,\" Schoonover said. \"With all of this money authorized, once you're seeing some pullback in stocks due to volatility, the companies will actually follow through on those buybacks.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: President Trump sides with Saudi crown prince in Khashoggi case", "description": "\"The View\" co-hosts react to the president's statement defending Saudi Arabia in the face of mounting pressure over the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/theview/video/president-trump-sides-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi-case-59346608", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/theview/181121_view_khashoggi_1101_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:06:22Z", "content": "Now Playing: Trump defends Saudi Arabia in Khashoggi murder Now Playing: Saudi official: Crown prince did not order Khashoggi killing Now Playing: What is on the Khashoggi killing tape?

Here's what he said about it. It's America first. Saudi Arabia, if we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof. I've kept them down. They've kept me keep them down. They didn't make a determination. It's just like I said, maybe he did, maybe he didn't. They did not make that assessment. The CIA has looked at it. They've studied it a lot. They have nothing definitive. So this morning he tweeted, thank you, Saudi Arabia, for lowering oil prices. He said it's about America first. But is it? You know, I looked it up. Canada provides 40% of oil, Saudi Arabia 9%, and yet he's so nasty to Canada. Justin Trudeau didn't kill anybody. He's mean to them and nice to the Saudis. What can you make of that? We don't know the reason. Maybe it's the fact that they bailed him out of bankruptcy one time. Maybe it's about the fact that they bought the entire trump tower one time. It's all these things that have to do with his pocketbook and not ours. As Americans we really need to educate ourselves because we really do need a full accounting of where his money comes from because the emoluments clause is very clear, the president should never put his personal wealth before American lives, America in general, American interests. And it just seems to me, like you just said, joy, when you look at his -- he's bragged about his financial relationship with Saudi Arabia. I think we have a clip of something he said at an Alabama campaign rally. Do we have that? Saudi Arabia -- and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them in very much. In 1986 Osama bin laden's brother lived in trump sawyer. Since 2016 Saudi bookings at his hotel have gone up 169%, a similar uptick in New York. What we have to ask ourselves I think as Americans is if the Saudis are intentionally lining his pockets, what do they expect in return? That is the question. And perhaps they expect to get a pass on the killing of Jamal khashoggi. Right. There have been a couple of statements made by a couple of Republicans -- Against the president. -- Against the president. One of them being Lindsey graham. Lindsey graham, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul. Do you have what they said, baby? Many things. Rand Paul who it's a cold day in hell when I agree with him said the president indicates that Saudi Arabia is the lesser of two evils compared to Iran, said the U.S. Won't punish Saudi Arabia for the brutal killing and dismemberment of a dissent journalist in their consulate. I disagree. I knew we were going to come out here and have a beautiful Thanksgiving spread which is tomorrow. Jamal khashoggi was brutally murdered for being a dissident in his country. There's a tectonic shift in our country where human rights violations, we're okay them and we don't have the same response we once did. I think the reason why the magnitsky act continues to be so important. 70 Saudi nationals were sanctioned in connection to this killing. I believe in America where we are a beacon -- as Ronald Reagan said, a shining beacon on top of a hill, sitting upon a hill, and I just don't know where we are as a country where you can slaughter a journalist and we're going to bat an eye, we're going to say there will be no ramifications for this. It sends a message globally that you can brutally murder journalists and it's okay and our president won't listen to the audio because it's too intense to hear and it's a really -- Sad day in America. I just -- I don't know what's happening. I don't mean to make this about my father, but things were very different when he was around and I feel very unsafe and that we're shifting in a way that's very dangerous and it's not the America I grew up with. We always want Republicans to take the place of John McCain. Other people should step up. The other day we were talking about the Navy S.E.A.L., Mcraven, who captured bin laden -- Helped. He helped capture bin laden. And Donald Trump basically dissed him and said they should have captured him sooner. Osama bin laden's brother is living in trump tower. Of course he's going to say something like that. But the GOP put out a statement saying this guy, Mcraven, did back Hillary, thus saying that they are backing Donald Trump in that statement. What the hell is going on with the GOP that they would say something about that against a Navy S.E.A.L., hero, in this country. That's what I want to know. Going back to the clip that we played in the intro, his response to reporters saying that he cares about America first, there's nothing America first about throwing your intelligence community under the bus ever. And we have seen this time and time again. These are moments where a president either rises as a true leader or you fail mserably and I think he's failed miss clee miserably. Human rights but also freedom of speech and if you don't stand strongly for that, what are we as a country? What do we stand for? So a state department official who has seen the version of the CIA's assessment of what they found said it is, quote, blindly obvious that the crown prince not only knew about it but ordered the murder of this journalist and the president saying he's not even sure if the crown prince even knows. We should also say Marco Rubio made a great point that human rights violations lead to mass migration, help extremism flourish and result in government hostilities towards the United States because we support their oppressors. When we support oppression, murderous dictatorships, again, it's a tectonic shift to be Americans and it's very depressing to tell you all this the day before Thanksgiving. You know what it will do, I hope, is that it will remind people what our freedoms are about so we can give thanks for how free we are and we can still protest and scream out loud when we see things that are wrong because nobody needs to take this. Nobody needs to be quiet about this. If this happens here, it's going to happen over here and over here and pretty soon it's going to be happening right there. So we owe it to ourselves as Americans to remember what Thanksgiving means and why we give thanks.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Moderate quake jolts Alaska's Cook Inlet; no damage reported", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

And I'm going to heaven and it makes me feel ten feet tall. I'm a super fan and I went to the 15th anniversary, if anyone saw it, fantastic. 15th anniversary of \"Wicked.\" It was a huge moment with you and idina Menzel. I want to know when was the moment you realize that your role would become so iconic? Opening night in San Francisco. We opened in San Francisco I went, this show -- not only are these roles going to hit because it was me too, before me too. I knew it and I said where do I sign for ten years on the dotted line? I was thinking about the advance. I knew. I already knew. Then we opened on Broadway but I knew. And \"Wicked\" wasn't received critically as great as it should have been but it didn't matter. I see that you're fully dressed but you forgot something today. What was it? I knew someone was going to tell you, joy. I forgot my panties. Oh! She forgot her underwear. Yes, I understand. I heard it in the hallway. The producers were on their microphone saying Kristin forgot her panties. I put on my dress and I'm like, it's awfully breezy down there. That's your air conditioning. That's right. As long as it comes in a package, I'm happy. So you made your grand entrance in some kind of flying bubble thing. Weren't you scared? It's high up like that. That makes me nervous. I was kind of nervous. When I went up, I had to go at five minutes to 8 and we passed all the crew in the wings. I'm like, bye, bye, bye. Then, yeah, it was a little nervous but I was harnessed so tightly. But that string could break. I did have a bad neck injury during it. I remember thinking, oh, no, the doctor had given me some medication -- Pain meds? Yeah. Should have told me to take a little less than my own body weight. So this is a note for y'all. I came out in that bubble and I was like, ah. I'm so happy. The wicked witch of the west is dead. I could hardly talk. But anyway -- Were you on that same medication today when you forgot your drawers? Huh? We've been friends a long time so we're silly. Listen, together we've been working on this Thanksgiving day special called \"I'm coming home.\" And we sent you back home to Oklahoma where you surprised your old high school drill team. Yeah. They had a surprise for you too as it turns out. Shall we look at the clip? Let's do. Clip. Oh! Okay, so, can I see? All: Yes! Kristin, I think there's somebody you want to see. It's your coach. So glad to see you. Are you doing okay? I'm happy to see you. I'm so happy to see you. That's nice. Got to you, huh? That's what I want to know. What was it like? Because it's really something when you go back to where you grew up. I mean, what was the biggest shock for you? That I was -- I thought I was a lot taller than I was. Everything was so small. But also just like that teacher, I didn't realize she was going to be there. She just instilled in me to be on time, to be professional, but she also was a positive role model, you did good, Kristin. I see that they're still doing it and it made me really proud. I was so proud of it. She believed in you. She did. She believed in me and she believed in all us girls. I want to say when you go home, if you haven't gone home, you should go home because it becomes about a bigger deal than yourself. You grew up with the arts, am I right? I did. I grew up in broken arrow, Oklahoma. There weren't many arts but what there was I did it. You absorbed whatever you could. Yes. Now I understand you're paying it back. What are you doing? About ten years ago they opened the performing arts center at broken arrow and named the theatre the Kristin Chenoweth theatre. I said I'm not old enough to have that and they said no, you are. But you're famous enough. Thank you. I had a heart attack. I was like, no, not yet. What are you going to do with that when you see your name on there, your grand dad's name and family name. I thought I'm going to start a Broadway boot camp. Last year we had over 1,000 kids. I had only pick 40. And we do seven-day intensive, singing, acting, dancing, and then we put on a show at the end. I've got future Tony and grammy award winners. It's such a comfort to go home. You are going to my hometown very soon, Salt Lake City, Utah, performing with the tabernacle. It's a huge deal. You know the tabernacle. It is the biggest event of the year. I'm excited because growing up, you know, in Oklahoma we didn't have Broadway. We didn't have -- we just didn't have that stuff. So I watched the tabernacle Christmas special every year. Though we don't agree on everything the same, I think it's important for me as a musician to get to make music with people that I have felt have made beautiful music most of my life. So I get to do it. I'm excited. It's a big deal. I have a dog Bernie. Oh, I know. I know Bernie. He's on Instagram @berniebehar if you want to check him out. He has about 30,000 followers already, this dog. I know. It's an embarrassment because I don't have that many. I understand that you have a dog also. What's your dog's name? My dog is thunder and she's rapidly coming close to 30,000 followers. How come yours has a sock line and mine doesn't? I don't know, joy. Get on it. You have a sock line for this dog, right? The socks came out yesterday. Oh, my gosh. And you know, I think they're great stocking stuffers but I mean, I'm like a mom. I think my kid's the cutest. I love Bernie but I love thunder. They're both cute. They are. That's a cute dog. I rescued her two years ago and she changed my life. I love her. Rescues are great. ??? Rescue me ??? I was adopted. Some would say that I was rescued. You're a rescue also, I forgot. Yeah. So it comes full circle. Exactly. That's what that \"Coming home\" special did for me. It was awesome. Thank y'all for having me. We love you.

How are you doing, young lady. In the red right there, the smile on her face. Right here? Right in the middle. That's who I meant. You're going to start a riot here. I mean, everyone is so -- ma'am, I mean -- All right, all right, all right. I got to say, I've never seen the audience like this. Unbelievable. But happy Thanksgiving to you. Happy Thanksgiving to you. We're all celebrating. I want to know what the tradition is in the Jordan family. Everyone has an eating strategy. What is your eating strategy? For me I just get one big plate and I pile everything on. I don't like making multiple trips, so I take one big pile pack to the couch and I eat until I'm in a deep coma. I pass out and wake up in the third quarter of the football game. Football and food. We have to talk about the midterms which were two weeks ago and we're still talking about it obviously. Before the elections you went knocking on doors of black families in Atlanta to remind them how important their votes would be, which I thought was such an incredible thing to do. People were like losing their minds. Yeah, yeah, yeah. People were losing their minds. She's doing the wakanda. I get welcomed with that a lot. So what made it important for you to do that? Honestly, I think we keep saying that this is the most important year, every year, this is the most important year. I think things have progressively been getting worse. So this year is the most important year thus far for voting and I wanted to let people know their voice does matter, they can make a change. They have to exercise that right to vote that our ancestors struggled and sacrificed so much to give them that ability. Did you tell them that when you knocked on the door? I wanted to give them encouragement because the people we were speaking with were local leaders in the community, getting other kids in the community out to the polls and I wanted to go out and thank those people for doing such a great job in their community and backing Stacey Abrams and stuff like so. It was really important to me. There's a lot of talk about inclusion in Hollywood or a lack of inclusion. Someone told me that you are basically taking the situation into your own hands. What are you doing? I like the walk the walk. Talking is cool but I just like to lead by example. I helped Warner brothers write their inclusion policy for their studio and this movie I just got finished doing is the first film under that policy and it's pretty much a first step to open up the doors and set a precedent for other studios to follow that lead. What does it mean? It basically means that you're going to -- that you're mandatory in each department to see a person of color, a woman, somebody from the lgbt community, that they have to be in heavily consideration for that. That's great. Warner brothers stepping up and doing that is a huge step, it's major, so salute to Warner brothers and their entire company. That's wonderful. Yes, so your name is absolutely everywhere, clearly, from the audience reaction. You're getting Oscar buzz for kill monger. It's very exciting. You're back as Adonis creed in \"Creed 2.\" What can fans expect in the second one? We building these characters and relationships that we set up in the first one, a little bit of a revenge story with the Dragos. Obviously that's a sore spot for Adonis, his father and the way he died. It's more of a love story. I wanted to challenge Adonis with fatherhood, with getting a fiance, with all the obstacles that come with family and relationship. We wanted to see Adonis mature over the years and over the course of the film we see that. You got some action, you got some love. It's so good. I saw it yesterday. I'm excited that Sylvester Stallone, aka, rocky is back. We have a clip. I'm not going to be here forever. What's that supposed to mean? It means you got to do some smart thinking. You want to talk about smart decisions, rock? You're in this house alone. Who been taking care of you? Me. I've been here for you. Who else you got? Listen, I'm taking this fight with or without you. Drama. Can I tell you something about the rocky franchise. You might not care about this but when my dad got sick I said over and over again and it's from rocky, it's not how hard you can hit, it's how hard you can get hit and keep moving. That's the power of these films with rocky and now \"Creed\" and Adonis. It's that underdog feeling of what's your limit. Overcome whatever challenges are in front of you and that's what I want people to feel when they see these movies, to be inspired. It was a lot of fun. Where's Cecilia? That's my aunty. I got to say hello. Oh, hi, aunty. She said she was going to be here with a group of mothers. They do a selective group and they go out and do certain things. This is a trip for her. That's great. I wanted to put her on blast. She's hiding in the back. I got to ask before you go, are you still singing? You're good at so many things but singing is not one of them but you love to do it. Watch this. I catch moments. ??? Oooh ??? ??? I would never find another lover sweeter than you, sweeter than you ??? That's a hard song. I usually hit those notes, you know. That's a tough song. I'm camera shy. In the shower I hit all of them. Listen man, you know you are always welcome at this table. You have been a friend of \"The view\" for a long time and we are just really so proud of you because, you know, since a little kid, you know. You guys watched me grow up and helped me grow up and I just appreciate you guys for being a home and a place to have these conversations and inspire people. We're all coming to your house at Thanksgiving. Come, come. Seriously, I want to thank you guys for what you guys do. It's really important and I don't think it's appreciated enough, so thank you guys. That's so nice. Our thanks to Michael B. Jordan. You got to go see \"Creed 2.\" It's in theaters today. Go and see \"Creed 2.\" I'm not playing with y'all.

Hundreds of people are unaccounted for \u2014 a list that's constantly changing and has spread confusion about the ultimate number of victims.\n\nHere are answers about the search for the dead and missing after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in at least a century destroyed the town of Paradise, population 27,000, and surrounding communities:\n\nWHY DOES THE NUMBER OF 'MISSING' KEEP FLUCTUATING?\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea has released a daily list of names of people who are unaccounted for, saying he doesn't expect it to be an accurate tally of the missing. He calls it a liberal roster of \"raw data\" intended to prompt people \u2014 some who may not know they have been reported missing \u2014 to call in and say they're safe.\n\nThe list has jumped from about 600 to 1,000 names before hitting a high of nearly 1,300 this past weekend. It stands at about 560 names Wednesday as deputies find people and people call in to say they were OK. Names are continually being removed and added.\n\nThe Associated Press reviewed the newest list and has found names of people reported as alive by family on social media. There are at least a dozen names marked as \"unknown,\" including a \"cousin\" and several with no last names. The list contains several entries that may be duplicates with different spellings.\n\nHOW IS THE LIST COMPILED?\n\nNames are compiled from emails, phone calls and emergency dispatch reports, Honea said. The number of names ramped up in part because deputies went back to calls from the early hours of the disaster, when people were calling frantically for help finding friends and family.\n\nIt is not clear at what point sheriff's officials remove a name because a person is presumed dead. Evacuee Christina Taft said her mother's name is no longer on the roster, but she has not received official confirmation that Victoria Taft is dead.\n\nHonea said the number of names rose Tuesday night after workers went through a backlog of voicemails.\n\nIS IT POSSIBLE THAT HUNDREDS ARE DEAD?\n\nHonea has declined to speculate on the eventual scope of deaths, preferring to instead release nightly updates on the death toll based on remains that have been recovered.\n\nWHO IS IN CHARGE OF SEARCH AND RECOVERY?\n\nThe Butte County sheriff's office is leading the effort, with assistance from search and recovery teams, cadaver detection and coroners' units from other counties, California, other states and the U.S. government.\n\n\"It's his county, and he and his team are leading the operations,\" Kelly Huston, a spokesman with the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, said of Honea.\n\nVolunteers also are helping track the names of people reported as safe.\n\nIS IT NORMAL TO HAVE SO MUCH CONFUSION TWO WEEKS AFTER A DISASTER?\n\nYes, according to emergency services experts.\n\nSonoma County sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Crum says his office took some 2,200 reports of missing people during last year's devastating wildfires in Northern California wine country. Eventually, 24 were confirmed dead. Most were identified within the first month, but Crum said it took two months to clear all the names.\n\nThe numbers were high in part because people, including distant relatives and long-ago friends, called in with incomplete information, Crum said.\n\nHis office prioritized callers who had specific information, such as a daughter calling in for help finding an elderly mother at her home address who likely could not have escaped a wildfire alone.\n\nCrum expects the current search for victims will take months given the number of destroyed homes, far exceeding the 4,600 houses that burned down in Sonoma County last year.\n\n\"They're just getting started,\" he said.\n\nWHY IS IT SO HARD TO IDENTIFY THE DEAD?\n\nSheriff Honea has said it's possible officials will never know the exact death toll.\n\nLight rain began falling Wednesday, which could potentially disturb remains. Searchers are looking carefully for fragments of bone, with some imagining where a person may have been when the fire roared through.\n\n\"In some cases, all they have is bone fragments and pieces of dental work and teeth, so it's immensely more challenging to identify people who have perished in a fire of this magnitude,\" said Kelly, the emergency services spokesman.\n\nHOW WILL RAIN AFFECT THE SEARCH FOR AND IDENTIFICATION OF REMAINS?\n\nRain is not helpful, but it's not a showstopper either, said Mitchell M. Holland, a biochemistry and molecular biology professor at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nWater could shift ground and prompt mudslides that cover up remains, making them that much harder to find, he said. Also, \"being exposed to water is never a great thing for DNA,\" but a good forensics lab can still extract information, Holland said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press delivers in-depth coverage on today's Big Story including top stories, international, politics, lifestyle, business, entertainment, and more. https://apnews.com/afs:Tag:69140001"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Kids starring in 'Mary Poppins Returns' share on-set moments with cast", "description": "Actors Pixie Davies and Joel Dawson, who play the Banks children in the \"Mary Poppins\" sequel, talk about what it was like to work with Emily Blunt, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Dick Van Dyke and more.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/kids-starring-mary-poppins-returns-share-set-moments-59345911", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/2020/181121_2020_poppins_kids_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:45:45Z", "content": "Now Playing: 'Mary Poppins Returns -Behind the Magic' A Special 2020 airs Thanksgiving 8/7c on ABC Now Playing: 'Mary Poppins Returns' star Emily Blunt shares hilarious on-set moment Now Playing: The hilarious Kristin Chenoweth and her adorable puppy visit 'G\u2026 [+1237 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Kids starring in 'Mary Poppins Returns' share on-set moments with cast\n\nI and 1880 and I can't act like I'm stoked.

Fearful his sons would have to join the gangs or be killed, he eventually joined thousands of Hondurans fleeing to the United States.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nThe 45-year-old, who asked to be identified only by his first name, is journeying through Mexico in a caravan of several thousand mostly Honduran migrants who are fleeing violence and poverty for a better life in the United States.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has declared the caravans an \"invasion,\" and has sent some 5,800 troops to \"harden\" the border, including with barbed wire.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nIvan, fearful to tell his story, is watchful for gang tattoos or slang that might suggest fellow migrants were associated with his persecutors back home. The former policemen said the final straw in Honduras came when gang members put a gun to his 15-year-old son Yostin's head.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nThey wanted Yostin and younger brother Julio, 13, to join them, threatening death if they refused, Ivan said during a break in the caravan's northward journey at temporary camp in a Mexico City stadium.\n\nSo when a caravan set off on Oct. 13 from the crime-racked Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, where the family was hiding with friends, they never hesitated. Reuters was not able to independently verify their story.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nHowever, their motives echo others in the caravan and are a reminder of the influence the gangs called 'maras' wield across El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala despite almost 20 years of efforts to crush them.\n\nHomicide rates have fallen in Honduras since 2016, as a consequence of initiatives that include prison reform, the creation of a specialized anti-gang security force, and increased resources for law enforcement.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nIn 2017 there were 42 murders per 100,000 residents in Honduras, compared to 57 per 100,000 in the prior year, according to statistics from the government and the World Bank.\n\nStill, the murder rate in Honduras remains one of the highest in the world and catastrophic. Some international aid organizations such as the Norwegian Refugee Council operate in the country with the same precautions as in war zones, and say inhabitants face the same dangers.\n\nAt the U.S. border barbed wire laid by soldiers deployed by Trump awaits the caravan to dissuade the migrants from crossing illegally. New rules curtailing asylum claims also increase the chances they will be deported.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nA return home terrifies many, including Ivan. Removed from his job of 27 years in a police purge two years ago, he says he fears death in Honduras.\n\nThe purge removed more than 4,000 officers, or close to a third of what is currently a 14,000 strong force, according to Commissioner Jair Meza, spokesperson for the Honduran Security Ministry.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nIvan says the purge removed good police as well as bad, while leaving the former officers exposed to revenge attacks from gangs they once pursued.\n\n\"They know us and so they hunt us down,\" he said.\n\nMeza said police who were removed were subject to polygraph tests and background checks before being selected. Age and performance were other considerations.\n\nIn Honduras, violence can strike at any time.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nOn the cocaine transit corridor to the nearby port of Puerto Cortes, San Pedro Sula was for years one of the world's most dangerous cities. Its morgue was so full of corpses that locals said their smell permeated the streets.\n\nOn a night in late July, a family sat on the side of a highway in San Pedro Sula, a few feet from a crime scene.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nFransisca Sislavas waited stone-faced between her son, Rony, 2, and her daughter, Brittany, 4. The girl's ankle was splattered with her father's blood.\n\nMinutes earlier, Sislavas had been sitting beside her partner and their children in a taxi. She struggled to explain his death.\n\n\"I don't know. Why? How? I just don't know,\" she said.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nFor some Hondurans who fail in their pursuit of the American Dream, deportation can mean an entrance into gang life.\n\nHenry Fernando, (not pictured), an active member of MS-13, also known as Mara Salvatrucha, said he walked more than 3,000 miles and almost died in the desert crossing from Mexico to find his mother, who had left him for Virginia.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nQuickly deported, MS-13 was the only home he found, he said, recalling the girlfriends, or \"jainas\", that leaders offered, serving as payment for the marijuana and crack cocaine he sold. Reuters was not able to independently verify his story.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it was unable to trace Fernando's deportation based on the information Reuters was able to provide.\n\nGoran Tomasevic/Reuters\n\nNine years later, now 28, he has a young son, and dreams of leaving the gang. His home, visited by Reuters, was a rented room barely wider than his mattress, up a rickety ladder in the middle of a pigsty. He had moved up the MS-13 ranks, but remains mired in poverty.\n\nFifteen people interviewed by Reuters, either active in the gangs or in stages of reforming, described only two ways out: join an Evangelical church or death.\n\nAll of them said they joined the gangs as boys from broken homes in broken neighborhoods.\n\nStory by Delphine Schrank"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC NEWS", "title": "Chief justice criticizes Trump's 'Obama judge' comment", "description": "Chief Justice John Roberts rebutted President Donald Trump's recent criticism of the judge who ruled on his asylum policy as an \"Obama judge\".", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chief-justice-john-roberts-rebuts-trump-obama-judge/story?id=59344259", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/supreme-court-justice-john-roberts-gty-jc-181121_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:28:10Z", "content": "Chief Justice John Roberts rebutted President Donald Trump 's recent criticism that the recent ruling against the administration's asylum policy on migrants was issued by an \"Obama judge\".

That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\u201d\n\nThe president responded directly to the comments in a pair of tweets Wednesday afternoon. \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,\" Trump said.\n\nSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u201cObama judges,\u201d and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country.

The appeals court, which has jurisdiction over a swath of California, has previously ruled against the Trump administration on a number of immigration policies.\n\n\"People should not be allowed to immediately run to this very friendly circuit and file their case -- and you people know better than anybody what is happening is a disgrace, in my opinion, it is a disgrace what happens with the 9th Circuit. We will win that case in the Supreme Court of the United States,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president's travel ban for majority-Muslim countries was blocked by judges in the 9th Circuit, but the Supreme Court later ruled the action was within the president's authority."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Mars landing comes down to final 6 minutes of 6-month trip", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Add Interest\n\nIt all comes down to the final six minutes of a six-month journey to Mars.\n\nNASA's InSight spacecraft will enter the Martian atmosphere at supersonic speed, then hit the brakes to get to a soft, safe landing on the alien red plains.\n\nAfter micromanaging every step of the way, flight controllers will be powerless over what happens at the end of the road Monday, nearly 100 million miles (160 million kilometers) away. The communication lag between Mars and Earth is eight minutes.\n\n\"By the time we hear anything, the whole thing is already done,\" said project manager Tom Hoffman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"Either it happened or it hasn't happened.\"\n\nAny small last-minute adjustments must be completed 1 \u00bd hours before touchdown, said Rob Grover, lead engineer for the landing team.\n\n\"All of our efforts to make sure we're successful all happen in the years before,\" he explained.\n\nA brief rundown of Insight's do-or-die entry, descent and landing:\n\nSIX MINUTES BEFORE TOUCHDOWN\n\nInSight will come in like a 12,300-mph (19,800-kph) arrow, piercing the top of the Martian atmosphere about 77 miles (114 kilometers) above the surface. Engineers are shooting for a 12-degree angle of attack, almost parallel to the ground. Too steep, the spacecraft could burn up. Too shallow, it could bounce back into space. Atmospheric friction slows the spacecraft, but builds up heat. Its heat shield is made to withstand the 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit (1,500 degrees Celsius). Once InSight is down to seven miles (11 kilometers), its parachute opens at a breakneck 860 mph (1,400 kph).\n\nTHREE MINUTES\n\nShortly after the white nylon chute opens with a yank, InSight ditches its heat shield and unfolds its three legs. After two minutes of descending under the parachute, the spacecraft, still supersonic, starts using radar to determine speed and altitude, from about 1 \u00bd miles (2 \u00bd kilometers) up. Less than a minute remains until touchdown. With its speed now down to 134 mph (215 kph), the lander dumps its back shell and parachute. It is less than a mile (one kilometer) above the ground.\n\nFORTY-FIVE SECONDS\n\nAlmost immediately, InSight's 12 descent engines start firing to further slow the lander and keep it away from the severed back shell, still falling under the parachute. The lander turns itself so its solar panels will extend east and west at touchdown, and its robotic arm faces south. InSight's speed is now 17 mph (27 kph), at an altitude of 164 feet (50 meters)\n\nFIFTEEN SECONDS\n\nNow in so-called constant velocity mode, InSight is aiming for a 5 mph (8 kph) touchdown in a plain near the equator called Elysium Planitia. There it will dig deep for heat measurements and scope out marsquakes over a full Martian year, or two Earth years. NASA picked this spot because it should be relatively flat and free of big rocks that could hamper science operations. Parking near the equator provides optimal sunlight for solar energy. \"It's a very safe place to land,\" Grover said at a press conference Wednesday.\n\nTOUCHDOWN!\n\nIt will be around 2 p.m., Mars time, when InSight lands. That's 3 p.m. on the U.S. East Coast and noon for the JPL flight controllers in Pasadena, California. NASA estimates temperatures could be in the teens or even single digits Fahrenheit (well below zero Celsius). Overnight lows could reach minus 140 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 96 degrees Celsius.) It's wintertime on Mars. \"Probably don't need an umbrella, but you may need a coat and definitely recommend a spacesuit, too, if you're there at the landing site,\" Grover joked to reporters while describing the bone-dry Martian plain.\n\nHELLO? HELLO?\n\nSince departing Earth in May, InSight has been shadowed by WALL-E and EVE, the first CubeSats to venture into deep space. The briefcase-size satellites named after the characters in the 2008 animated movie will pass within a few thousand miles (kilometers) of Mars, as InSight lands. NASA hopes one or both relay InSight's radio signals. If the experiment succeeds, flight controllers may be able to follow InSight's descent and landing, although with a lag of more than eight minutes at best. Otherwise, news will trickle in from NASA's Mars orbiters.\n\nSAY CHEESE:\n\nInSight's first job, just several minutes after landing, is to take a picture. Ground controllers want to see what they're up against. Big rocks or a hillside could interfere with the stationary lander's geology experiments. Once the red dust settles about 16 minutes after touchdown, the lander will spread its solar panels and settle in for its first long winter's nap at Mars.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

It hopes to build on the momentum created in August when drilling resumed in key oil fields for the first time since 2013. The aim is to return to the pre-conflict production of 350,000 barrels per day.\n\nSome at the investment conference expressed cautious optimism after preliminary signs of growth.\n\nEarlier this year Russian oil company Zarubezhneft signed a memorandum of understanding with South Sudan's oil ministry to explore the 10 oil blocks that remain open.

Add Thanksgiving as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Thanksgiving news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nEach Thanksgiving, millions of Americans tote turkeys home from the store. If you find yourself plopping a fresh, shrink-wrapped bird into your cart, you can thank particle physicists for the sturdy, shelf life-extending packaging.\n\nThat's because the food industry makes shrink wrap using a tool first developed in physics labs: an electron accelerator.\n\nTo understand how the process works, imagine the atoms in the plastic as individuals at a large Thanksgiving dinner. Initially these people only hang out with others they already know, or the family members they know they like. (In shrink wrap, the \"in-groups\" are long strings of bonded atoms called polymer chains.) This initial configuration is weak, since the groups easily drift apart.\n\nNow imagine an accelerated electron as an expert Thanksgiving host. It can zip through the gathering and break apart conversations, encouraging people to shake hands with others in different groups. The technical name for this process in plastics is cross-linking. It makes the plastic tougher and more heat-resistant.\n\nCross-linking is essential for making shrink wrap because it allows manufacturers to heat the plastic and stretch it into a thin film without it breaking or melting into a mess. When the film is cooled it retains the stretched-out shape. But make the film into a bag, drop a turkey (or other item) inside and reheat it, and the plastic will shrink, creating a tight seal with whatever is inside.\n\nThe plastic industry serves up a hearty helping of shrink wrap each year. And it's just a tiny portion of the overall market for industrial particle accelerators, which are also used to cross-link the protective plastic around electrical wiring, sterilize medical equipment and enhance the color of gemstones.\n\nIndustrial machines are cheaper and less powerful than famous particle accelerators such as the massive Large Hadron Collider in Europe, which physicists used in 2012 to confirm the existence of a particle called the Higgs boson. But industry accelerators represent a tangible way particle physics touches everyday life, and their applications are still expanding.\n\n\"Electron beams have the potential to treat wastewater, pave better roads and add to the flourishing and wealth of the modern economy,\" said Charles Thangaraj, an accelerator physicist at Fermilab\u2019s Illinois Accelerator Research Center located outside of Chicago, which helps to transfer accelerator technologies developed at the lab to industry applications.\n\nSo, this Thanksgiving, as you pop your turkey out of its form-fitting plastic sheath, consider taking a moment to give thanks for the physics that makes it possible.\n\nEditor's Note: This article was updated on Nov. 20, 2018, to clarify Charles Thangaraj's position at Fermilab.\n\nReprinted with permission from Inside Science, an editorially independent news product of the American Institute of Physics, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing, promoting and serving the physical sciences."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Thanksgiving surprise: Couple finds $1.8 million jackpot-winning lottery ticket while cleaning up their home - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Thanksgiving surprise: Couple finds $1.8 million jackpot-winning lottery ticket while cleaning up their home ABC News A Louisiana couple preparing to welcome their family for Thanksgiving were cleaning their home this week when they found an unexpect\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/thanksgiving-surprise-couple-finds-18-million-jackpot-winning/story?id%3D59340179", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:07:44Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Bopha Phorn", "title": "Couple finds $1.8 million winning lottery ticket while cleaning up for Thanksgiving", "description": "Couple found $1.8 million jackpot winning ticket while cleaning their home to welcome family for thanksgiving.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/thanksgiving-surprise-couple-finds-18-million-jackpot-winning/story?id=59340179", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/lotto-louisiana-ht-ml-181121_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:07:25Z", "content": "A Lousiana couple preparing to welcome their family for Thanksgiving were cleaning their home this week when they found an unexpected surprise: a winning lottery ticket worth nearly $2 million.

That general idea has been demonstrated at science fairs, but the new work shows it can power a free-flying airplane.\n\nSo can people look forward to traveling in planes that are almost silent and emit no air pollution?\n\n\"Not anytime soon,\" says Steven Barrett of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who reported the results in a study released Wednesday by the journal Nature.\n\nIt's not clear whether the technology could work at such a large scale, he said in a telephone interview. And even if it can, it would take a few decades to develop such planes, he said.\n\nBefore that, the approach might be used in airplane-like drones that perform tasks like environmental monitoring and surveillance, he said. As drones become more common in urban skies, the lack of noise would be an advantage in making them less bothersome to people on the ground, he said.\n\nThe Nature paper reports the results of 10 test flights inside an MIT athletic building. With a wingspan of about 16 feet (5 meters), the five-pound (2.45-kilogram) plane sailed along at about 11 mph (17 kph). Each flight covered about 60 yards (55 meters).\n\nBarrett, 35, said he was inspired as a child by watching \"Star Trek\" television episodes and movies, where he was struck by the shuttles that flew with no moving parts in their propulsion systems. He recalled thinking, \"There should be a way things should fly without having propellers and (jet) turbines.\"\n\nAs an adult, he focused on that and came across a concept called \"ionic wind.\"\n\nFor the MIT airplane, that involves a series of thin wires at the front of the plane that generate a powerful electric field. The field strips electrons from air molecules, turning the molecules into positively charged particles called ions. Those ions flow toward negatively charged parts of plane, colliding with ordinary air molecules and transferring energy to them. That produces a wind that provides thrust for the plane, Barrett explained.\n\nA similar process has long been used in outer space to propel some spacecraft, he said.\n\nBarrett said he hopes to find a way to eliminate the \"very slight buzz\" one can hear.\n\n\"I think they're onto something here,\" said Pat Anderson, a professor of aerospace engineering at the Daytona Beach, Florida, campus of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He had no role in the research.\n\nHe called the results impressive. But the experimental aircraft lacks the range and endurance to serve as a useful drone, and it's not clear whether the technology could be scaled up to fix that or become useful for propelling a passenger plane, he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Malcolm Ritter at @MalcolmRitter\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Any response from the White House so artist I'm surprised we haven't seen entry from the president that I am but the certainly campaigned on this this was something he has talked about since he took office. So it not surprising that he tried to push this forward but indeed has in the New York Times report that the White House counsel at the time dom began. Had the legal team write a memo to get to the president to lay out why this would be very bad for him why this could spark calls for impeachment. And this politically with a headache that they said he just could not take so the White House I think we'll try and Latin. Perhaps not address this but it is notable because there isn't a lot of criticisms right now over the president pushing out the attorney general Jeff Sessions bringing in Matt Whitaker now and the acting attorney general. A lot of questions about his authority and whether or not he is going to try and push forward more of the president's. Politically motivated decisions and in the things he'd like to see down at the Justice Department the big criticism from the president of why he was always so frustrated and angry with Jess Jeff Sessions today and he would always say you know possessions just wasn't doing what he wanted him to do wasn't being tougher there as the head of the justice to. The president also where you're submitted answers at least some of special counsel Robert -- questions. Going on upfront. Yeah across a big to do list item for the president before he left for Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday the press told us yesterday the White House that he had finished his answers and then it was up for those lawyers to turn them in we heard late yesterday that they had done just that. The lawyers say that these questions were divided up into five parts and no surprise focus very heavily on questions about. Collusion with Russia in 2016 election the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani had told acts he has here in Washington. That Moeller also asked the president whether he knew. At the time about his son John junior's meeting with Russians. Trump tower back in twenty sixteenths is a very pivotal event in his timeline in in the investigation. Not sure what the president answered though of course. Rudy Giuliani also told ABC news it's time for this inquiry to be over but Deng and we don't know what this means for the timeline. Of course this ends months of negotiations between the threatening legal team and the special counsel about how they would question the president. But now that he's turning his answers. Where are we in this process we just don't know because of course Robert Mueller is not making a lot of things very public all right understandably so and Karen the president also getting a lot of flack for seemingly standing by the Saudi prince and his denials of having anything to do with jamarcus Shannon's dad. Now attends a senate is trying to force trumps hand in a way what's going on there. It's unlikely the president is going to bowed to pressure from lawmakers he made it very clear yesterday that for him it is America first and he is not going to do anything to jeopardize the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia he gets he said. They're just too many economic implications he doesn't want to see the price of oil go laps he doesn't want to jeopardize that weapons sale agreement. That he made last year with the saudis. But you're right he's a lot of pressure now from lawmakers from Republicans from allies of his Rand Paul Republican senator said the president's statement was Saudi Arabia first not America first. Bob Corker another Republican senator critic of the president. Said that this was a press release for Saudi Arabia what the president was saying yesterday about holding the saudis accountable for the can show he murder. Neither Lindsey Graham and very close ally of the president says that he things or be strong bipartisan support for tough sanctions on the saudis. President made it very clear it's lawmakers' what I got I didn't do that and try and pursue that they can do that.

Her daughter has become quiet and reserved. Her son is always nervous, believing that police in the U.S. will try to take his teddy bear as Vietnamese police did when they arrested his mother.\n\nQuynh said she plans to highlight the harsh prison conditions activists and others still incarcerated in Vietnam face, including a lack of proper health care and for female prisoners, a lack of privacy where they essentially have to shower in view of male guards.\n\n\"When I was in prison, the Vietnamese authorities always tried to convince me that ...

Add Supreme Court as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Supreme Court news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Chief Justice John Roberts clashed Wednesday in an extraordinary public dispute over the independence of America's judiciary, with Roberts bluntly rebuking the president for denouncing a judge who rejected his migrant asylum policy as an \"Obama judge.\"\n\nThere's no such thing, Roberts declared in a strongly worded statement contradicting Trump and defending judicial independence. Never silent for long, Trump defended his own comment, tweeting defiantly, \"Sorry Justice Roberts.\"\n\nThe pre-Thanksgiving dustup was the first time that Roberts, the Republican-appointed leader of the federal judiciary, has offered even a hint of criticism of Trump, who has several times blasted federal judges who have ruled against him.\n\nBefore now, it has been highly unusual for a president to single out judges for personal criticism. And a chief justice's challenge to a president's comments is downright unprecedented in modern times.\n\nIt seemed a fight that Trump would relish but one that Roberts has taken pains to avoid. But with Roberts' court feeling the heat over the president's appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Roberts and several of his colleagues have gone out of their way to rebut perceptions of the court as a political institution divided between five conservative Republicans and four liberal Democrats.\n\nTrump's appointments to the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have themselves spurred charges that the courts are becoming more politicized. As the justice widely seen as closest to the court's middle, Roberts could determine the outcome of high-profile cases that split the court.\n\nThe new drama began with remarks Trump made Tuesday in which went after a judge who ruled against his migrant asylum order. The president claimed, not for the first time, that the federal appeals court based in San Francisco was biased against him.\n\nRoberts had refused to comment on Trump's earlier attacks on judges, including the chief justice himself. But on Wednesday, after a query by The Associated Press, he spoke up for the independence of the federal judiciary and rejected the notion that judges are loyal to the presidents who appoint them.\n\n\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,\" Roberts said.\n\nOn the day before Thanksgiving, he concluded, \"The independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nTrump hit back from his resort home in Florida, questioning the independence of federal judges appointed by his predecessor and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. He especially criticized judges on California's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,\" the president tweeted.\n\nIf the 9th Circuit judges are independent, he said, \"why are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. ... these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\"\n\nTrump has never been reticent about criticizing the judiciary. Last year, the president scorned the \"so-called judge\" who made the first federal ruling against his travel ban. During the presidential campaign, he criticized Roberts himself for the chief justice's decisive vote in 2012 to preserve President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.\n\nTrump also referred to an Indiana-born judge of Mexican descent, who was presiding over a fraud lawsuit against Trump University, as a Mexican who would be unable to rule fairly because of Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nThe president's remarks on Tuesday came when a reporter asked for his reaction to a ruling by U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco that put the administration's asylum policy on hold. Under that new policy, Trump declared no one could apply for asylum except at an official border entry point. That tends to back migrants up for weeks if not months. A number of migrants remain in Tijuana after traveling in a caravan to reach the U.S.\n\nTrump complained that his opponents file lawsuits in courts that are part of California's liberal-leaning 9th Circuit. It's not unusual for those challenging a president's policies to sue in courts they consider likely to back their claims. Conservative groups tended to bring challenges to Obama-era policies in Texas, part of the conservative-leaning 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.\n\n\"Every case that gets filed in the 9th Circuit, we get beaten. And then we end up having to go to the Supreme Court, like the travel ban, and we won,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president went on to say about the asylum ruling: \"This was an Obama judge. And I'll tell you what, it's not going to happen like this anymore. \"\n\nThe initial travel ban ruling in 2017 was issued by U.S. District Judge James Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush in Washington state. Roberts, too, was appointed by Bush.\n\nIt was unclear what Trump meant when he said things would change. The 9th Circuit is by far the largest of the federal appellate courts, covering Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Some Republicans in 9th Circuit states have proposed splitting the circuit in two, but legislation has not advanced.\n\nThe court has long had a majority of judges appointed by Democratic presidents, with the current breakdown at 16-7. But Trump has the opportunity to narrow that edge significantly because there are six vacancies, and he already has nominated candidates for five of them."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson face off for $9 million", "description": "The golf stars are piling on bets ahead of the match on Friday.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/video/tiger-woods-phil-mickelson-face-off-million-59343718", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/181121_abcnl_espn_golf_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:46:29Z", "content": "Now Playing: Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson discuss high-stakes matchup Now Playing: Tiger Woods wins 1st tournament in over 5 years Now Playing: LeBron James returns to Cleveland Now Playing: Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson face off for $9 million Now Playing: W\u2026 [+1245 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson face off for $9 million\n\nAnd sticking with sports.

In September, a judge sentenced him to 14 days in prison \u2013 a sentence due to begin Monday.\n\nBut last week, with a new team of lawyers, the man once derided by a former Trump campaign adviser as a \"coffee boy\" filed a last-ditch appeal with a Washington, D.C., federal court Friday to try to forestall his looming stint in a Midwestern medium-security penitentiary.\n\nIn the court filing, Papadopoulos argued that the court should wait until an appeals court hears arguments in a separate case challenging the validity of the special counsel. Attorneys in that case, which was brought by a man fighting a subpoena from the special counsel, are scheduled to have briefs filed to the court the same day Papadopoulos is due to surrender for prison.\n\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn countering the new appeal, prosecutors argued that Papadopoulos had long since passed the date by which he was entitled to make this argument. His agreement to plead guilty expressly prohibited him from mounting an appeal on any grounds other than newly discovered evidence or ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nProsecutors also reminded the judge of the contrite appearance Papadopoulos made before he was sentenced to two weeks in prison \u2013 a term far shorter than the possible six-month stretch he was facing.\n\n\"He said that his parents raised him 'with the principles of honesty and respect for the law,' and when he lied to the FBI, he 'cast aside those principles and compromised the person who,'\" prosecutors reminded the judge. \"The defendant further stated that, 'standing here in front of the Court and you, your Honor, and the public today signals to all future and current witnesses in this investigation that this investigation has global implications and that the truth matters.'\"\n\nThe Papadopoulos appeal came after he spent weeks on social media and in TV appearances challenging the validity of the case against him. He did not say why he waited to mount the challenge in court.\n\nOn Wednesday, attorneys for Papadopoulos asked the judge to delay his sentence until the separate legal matter challenging the validity of the special counsel investigation had been resolved. That case was brought by Andrew Miller, a former associate of Trump confidant and political provocateur Roger Stone, who has refused a demand from prosecutors to appear before a grand jury. Miller is objecting, his lawyers said, in order to mount a broad legal challenge to the legitimacy of the special counsel probe.\n\nMiller's attorney, Paul Kamenar, told ABC News in August that he believes Miller's constitutional battle could head all the way to the Supreme Court. He has argued that Mueller was not a constitutionally valid special counsel because he should be considered a \"principal officer of the United States\" because of his broad mandate, and therefore should have been appointed by the president. The Department of Justice has taken the position that he is an \"inferior\" officer who could be appointed by a deputy, in this case, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nTo date, Miller\u2019s argument has not carried the day. Attorneys for Miller tried unsuccessfully two times in July to quash a subpoena requiring Miller to testify before the special counsel's grand jury, arguing that Mueller lacked the constitutional authority to issue it.\n\nProsecutors in the Papadopoulos matter said he had months to ask whether the Miller challenge could impact his own case \u2013 noting that the first court opinion addressing the validity of the Special Counsel's appointment was publicly released on August 2, 2018 \u2013 \"well in advance of his sentencing, and the litigation the defendant cites as his ostensible reason for delay has long been the subject of much public commentary.\"\n\nProsecutors also note that Papadopoulos has failed to established \"that he would be able to surmount the procedural hurdles of his guilty plea, his plea-agreement waivers, and his failure to raise the issues in a timely manner, as would be needed to show that the issue is likely to result in reversal.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Special counsel moves to enforce jail term for former Trump aide George Papadopoulos - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Special counsel moves to enforce jail term for former Trump aide George Papadopoulos ABC News The team of special counsel Robert Mueller asked a judge Wednesday to reject last-ditch efforts by one-time Donald Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos t\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/special-counsel-moves-enforce-jail-term-trump-aide/story?id%3D59341456", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:45:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: LeBron James returns to Cleveland", "description": "The basketball hero returns to his hometown as an opponent as the Lakers and Cavaliers face off.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/video/lebron-james-returns-cleveland-59343774", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/181121_abcnl_espn_lebron_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:41:40Z", "content": "Now Playing: LeBron James joins Lakers Now Playing: LeBron James breaks his silence on leaving Cavaliers Now Playing: LeBron James returns to Cleveland Now Playing: Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson face off for $9 million Now Playing: What Meghan Markle's fashion \u2026 [+1217 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for LeBron James returns to Cleveland\n\nWe have some important news for Cleveland LeBron James is returning to his home city this time.

And Kohl's has been mapping out where retailers like Bon-Ton and Sears shuttered stores so it can target those customers with specific ads.\n\nKohl's is also adding more beauty products, which had been an area of expertise for Bon-Ton, the York, Pennsylvania-based department store chain that closed the last of its stores in August. Kohl's believes one-third of its store base is benefiting from department store closings, up from one quarter a year ago.\n\nTarget CEO Brian Cornell estimated up to $100 billion in market share that's now up for grabs \u2014 about double what he foresaw just a year ago. In response, the company is accelerating its store remodels in areas where bankrupt retailers once had stores. Target has devoted extra space at 500 of its stores for bigger toys like electric cars, playhouses and musical instruments as well as adding nearly 200 more products. About half of those locations are about five miles from former Toys R Us stores.\n\n\"We regularly look at retailers on the Moody's credit watch list,\" Cornell told reporters last month. \"We think about strategies market by market.\"\n\nIn 2018, there have been roughly 30 retailers that have filed for bankruptcy, including household names like Sears Holdings Corp., Mattress Firm, and David's Bridal. That compares with 41 last year \u2014 the highest since 2011, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, a research firm. Both Toys R Us and Bon-Ton liquidated this past summer just months after trying to reorganize in bankruptcy court.\n\nIn 2008, 440 retailers filed for bankruptcy, the highest number since S&P started tracking the data.\n\nThe rampant closures don't tell the entire story. In fact, according to research firm IHL Group, 2018 will see a net growth of more than 3,800 stores, with 12,664 stores opening this year and 8,828 shuttering. And the closings represent a concentration of retailers. This year, 16 retailers represent 66 percent of the closings, compared with 48 percent last year.\n\nThe National Retail Federation expects holiday retail sales to increase as much as 4.8 percent over 2017. The sales growth marks a slowdown from last year's 5.3 percent but remains healthy.\n\nRetailers should be cautious about targeting shoppers from defunct retailers, says Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consultancy.\n\n\"The trick is capitalizing on the opportunity without going overboard,\" he said. For retailers like Bon-Ton and Sears, \"people who were still shopping there were older and spending less.\"\n\nSears has long ceded territory in plenty of areas like toys and clothing. Its last bastion: appliances and home improvement, both areas that home improvement retailer Lowe's is targeting.\n\nLowe's CEO Marvin Ellison told AP he estimates about $2.5 billion to $3 billion up for grabs in appliances; for home improvement, that figure is anywhere from $600 million to a billion dollars. Lowe's has been expanding its appliances, and started stocking up on Craftsman tools, which Ellison thinks has attracted Sears shoppers.\n\nStill, even as retailers scramble to fill the hole, in many cases that won't be enough. Take Toys R Us, which had a constant supply of hot products throughout the year, not just for the holidays.\n\n\"No one is going to be able to fill the Toys R Us void,\" said Isaac Larian, CEO of MGA Entertainment, the maker of the highly popular LOL toys. His overall global business has tripled, but at Little Tikes, known for its large size toys like cook kitchen sets and toy cars, business is down 11 percent, leaving its factory in Hudson, Ohio, often idle.\n\n\"I'm looking at everything possible to find other ways to fill that factory,\" he added.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Poland moves to reinstate retired judges to Supreme Court", "description": "Poland's parliament passed legislation Wednesday to reinstate Supreme Court judges who were recently forced to retire, a step that could significantly ease a standoff with the European Union", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/poland-moves-reinstate-retired-judges-supreme-court-59335169", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:37:13Z", "content": "Poland's parliament passed legislation Wednesday to reinstate Supreme Court judges who were recently forced to retire, a step that could significantly ease a standoff with the European Union.

That, along with the broader overhaul of the justice system, has raised serious concerns over rule of law in the young democracy, with the EU saying the changes erode the independence of the judicial branch of government.\n\nWednesday's legislative initiative \u2014 which noted that it was introduced to comply with the EU court ruling \u2014 marks one of the first significant steps by Poland to meet EU demands.\n\n\"We know very well that in politics effectiveness matters and that sometimes you have to take one step back to take two steps forward,\" said Stanislaw Piotrowicz, a ruling party lawmaker and one of the key architects of the judicial overhaul, in an interview with the wPolityce.pl portal.\n\nZselyke Csaky, an expert on Central Europe with Freedom House, called it a \"significant\" step and a sign by the ruling party of \"common sense,\" though she also said on Twitter that \"the full damage to rule of law and legal certainty will be much harder to remedy.\"\n\nThe Polish government, in power since 2015, has been forced to climb down before. Earlier this year it softened a Holocaust speech law that made it a crime to attribute co-responsibility in the Holocaust to the Polish nation and which sparked a major diplomatic dispute with Israel. It also dropped draft legislation in 2016 that would have tightened the already restrictive abortion law after massive street protests by women wearing black.\n\nBut it is an almost unheard-of concession to the EU, which the government often says has no right to meddle in its internal affairs.\n\nUnder the amendment passed Wednesday to the new law on the Supreme Court, the judges who were forced to retire early will have the choice of returning to their duties. The law had lowered the retirement age from 70 to 65, and any judge who wished to remain had to request the consent of the president.\n\nThe party introduced the amended legislation to the parliament Wednesday and it was passed quickly by the lower house. It goes next to the Senate and also needs the president's signature, but since both are aligned with the party, these steps are all but certain to happen.\n\nThe party's reversal comes after local elections last month that showed Law and Justice winning the most seats in regional assemblies but losing badly in mayoral races in the cities and even mid-size towns. The results suggested the party's conflicts with the EU \u2014 which is extremely popular among voters \u2014 have cost it votes among urban, middle-class voters.\n\nIt also comes as the party, which has a strong anti-corruption profile, finds itself mired in corruption allegations. Last week the head of the state financial authorities resigned over allegations he had solicited a bribe of millions of dollars from a billionaire who heads two troubled banks."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: American believed to have been killed by isolated tribe in India: Reports", "description": "The man was killed after taking an illegal trip to visit an isolated tribe.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/american-believed-killed-isolated-tribe-india-reports-59343490", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/181121_wabc_tribe_kills_american_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:30:58Z", "content": "Now Playing: American believed to have been killed by isolated tribe in India: Reports Now Playing: A turkey's press conference, wildfire battle, rebels rest: World in Photos Now Playing: Police help cat locked out of Prime Minister Theresa May's office Now P\u2026 [+1250 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for American believed to have been killed by isolated tribe in India: Reports\n\nVisits to north sentinel island are heavily restricted by the Indian government.

They claimed the Education Department was tossing aside legitimate civil rights grievances in the interest of government efficiency and clearing a backlog.\n\nThat lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Maryland, is ongoing as the civil rights groups seek to make the approach announced this week permanent and binding.\n\nThe Education Department\u2019s reversal \"shows that recent legal action taken against them is working,\" said Denise Marshall, executive director for the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates.\n\nThe Education Department's Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus said ensuring equal access to education remains a \"top priority\" for the department.\n\nMarcus - who took over the Office of Civil Rights, or OCR, in June - said in the statement that he decided to alter the investigative protocols after receiving \u201cimportant and constructive feedback\u201d on it.\n\nCarolyn Kaster/AP\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to work to improve the timeliness of OCR case processing, we have determined that additional revisions will help improve our work and allow us to be more responsive to students, stakeholders, and our staff,\u201d he said.\n\nAt issue is a decision last March in which the Education Department said it would dismiss civil rights grievances that were part of a \u201cpattern of complaints\u201d that placed an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the government. The Education Department also at the time eliminated the appeals process. The changes were included in a case processing manual used by federal officials who investigate civil rights complaints at schools.\n\nMarcie Lipsitt, a Michigan advocate for special education students, said the move was aimed at people like her. Lipsitt said she filed some 2,400 complaints in two years claiming that certain school websites, including online math programs, weren\u2019t accessible for the blind or visually impaired.\n\nLipsitt said she had already resolved more than 1,000 of those complaints with school districts. But after the Education Department changed its investigative protocols last March, she received a flood of notifications that hundreds of her complaints would be dismissed.\n\nShe said she was infuriated \"that they could basically destroy all the work I\u2019ve done in just a couple weeks.\"\n\nEve Hill, a lawyer representing the civil rights groups, said she believes the Education Department's decision to backtrack was intended to invalidate the lawsuit. Shortly before the announcement, Hill, who works for the Baltimore-based firm Brown, Goldstein and Levy, said she had asked the judge in the case to lift a temporary stay and move ahead with litigation.\n\nHill said the lawsuit isn't over because the recent change amounts to a non-binding \u201cpromise\u201d that could be reversed at any point. She said she wants a settlement agreement or a ruling from the federal judge that would permanently block the government from dismissing serial filings.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to do that,\u201d Hill said. \u201cPeople face discrimination more than once. It\u2019s the Education Department\u2019s job to investigate them.\u201d\n\nAlso unclear is what will happen to the 692 cases filed by five people - including Lipsitt and her son - that were dismissed after the new approach took effect in March.

The state of North Carolina is also offering a $5,000, bringing the total possible reward amount to $30,000.\n\nHania is described as a Hispanic girl who is 5 feet tall and weighs about 125 pounds, according to the FBI. She has black hair and brown eyes and was last seen wearing a blue shirt with flowers and blue jeans.\n\nAuthorities have set up a special tip line that anyone can call if they have information to help investigators find Hania: (910) 272-5871.\n\nABC News' Rachel Katz and Emily Shapiro contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Man sentenced to 34 months in prison for raping dying woman", "description": "Brian Varela, 20, pleaded guilty to raping 18-year-old Alyssa Noceda while she overdosed on drugs, according to ABC affiliate KOMO.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/man-sentenced-34-months-prison-raping-dying-woman-59343103", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181121_komo_light_sentence_rape_dying_woman_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:19:21Z", "content": "Now Playing: New Jersey mansion fire being probed as quadruple homicide Now Playing: Aaron Rodgers donates $1 million to California wildfire recovery efforts Now Playing: Man sentenced to 34 months in prison for raping dying woman Now Playing: Sara Haines sur\u2026 [+1201 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Man sentenced to 34 months for raping dying woman\n\nGina piercing still grieves for the Angel on her sure.

So the driver of a midsize car or crossover is saving about $4 on a fill-up while drivers of bigger SUVs could save $7 to $8.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that the price drop was \"Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World.\"\n\nThe president, who had criticized OPEC during the run-up in oil to above $80, also thanked Saudi Arabia for the recent drop in the price. How much credit OPEC and Saudi Arabia deserve is questionable, however. Along with the U.S. and Russia, the Saudis had boosted oil production in anticipation of sharply lower exports from Iran, due to pending U.S. sanctions. But Trump added a six-month waiver for several countries that are major consumers of Iranian oil when he imposed the sanctions on Nov. 5.\n\nInstead of spiking, oil prices have slumped. Concerns about slowing global growth and weaker demand have also weighed on prices.\n\nIt's likely Saudi Arabia and OPEC will take actions to raise prices. Analysts at Commerzbank expect OPEC and some non-OPEC countries to agree to a production cut of at least 1 million barrels per day at the cartel's next meeting on Dec. 6 in Vienna.\n\n\"We see the oil market as being in a phase of exaggeration and expect a noticeable price recovery after the OPEC meeting at the latest,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe drop in oil prices isn't all good news for the U.S. economy, now that the nation has more than doubled its production of oil over the last decade. The price decline could lead to less investment in new rigs in oil-producing U.S. states, offsetting the overall impact on economic growth.\n\n\"Lower oil prices are now a net drag on the U.S. economy. This is a huge break from the past,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nShepherdson said the oil price drop would soften growth \"at the margins\" as the U.S. slows once the boost from recent tax cuts fades.\n\nThe economic impact is also different this time for Russia, which fell into recession after the last oil slump. Analysts say the country, a major oil and gas producer, is more insulated from a market drop because it has found ways to balance the state budget at lower oil prices. That's one reason Russia has been pumping oil at top speed recently.\n\nThe IEA says abundant global oil supplies should be welcomed as insurance against market volatility. It says lower prices are also a big break for people in developing countries who have seen fuel prices rise due to a stronger U.S. dollar, the currency oil is denominated in.\n\nThe U.S. oil contract traded at $55.55 a barrel in midday trading in the U.S. on Wednesday, up $2.12, or 4 percent.

But this is no game \u2014 it's a serious attempt to better understand how the giant mammals become entangled in fishing lines.\n\nTim Werner, a senior scientist at the New England Aquarium's Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, hopes the technology will lead to safer fishing gear designs and help critically endangered North Atlantic right whales avoid the looming threat of extinction.\n\n\"If we can see how they get entangled, it would help us prevent it. The technology in computers has evolved to a state where we can model these things,\" he said.\n\nMore than eight in 10 critically endangered right whales become ensnared by fishing lines, and nearly six in 10 are entangled more than once.\n\nEntanglements are a leading cause of right whale deaths. Experts estimate there are no more than 440 animals left on the planet, and the species' future is bleak because of heavy mortality and poor reproduction in recent years.\n\nWerner says the video simulation has helped his team better understand how whales unwittingly \u2014 and often lethally \u2014 wrap themselves in the fishing buoy lines that hang vertically in the ocean.\n\nMarine biologists say entangled whales often can't feed, and the stress weakens them and makes females less likely to birth calves. This past season, not a single new birth was discovered.\n\nAquarium scientists, working with researchers at Duke University, published their findings this week in the journal Marine Mammal Science, describing how they're using a standard video game console to \"swim\" a computer-generated whale through heavily fished waters to recreate an entanglement.\n\nThe simulator shows how a whale might flinch as it strikes a rope, then instinctively corkscrew and roll \u2014 ending up with the line hopelessly wrapped around its body and flippers.\n\nIt also lets researchers reverse the simulated entanglement. Vikki Spruill, the aquarium's president and CEO, says the technology is the latest effort to work with fishermen and engineers to solve the entanglement threat. Scientists working with a grant from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration already are testing ropeless gear with lobstermen in the Gulf of Maine.\n\n\"It's our mission to find conservation measures that make a difference,\" Spruill said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nWerner said the simulator accomplishes what scientists can't do in real life: test fishing gear on actual whales.\n\n\"There aren't enough of them, and we wouldn't purposely see them get entangled,\" he said. Plus, it would take decades \u2014 time the species doesn't have \u2014 to collect enough data.\n\nResearchers say they eventually may use the simulator to model and study threats to other ocean creatures such as leatherback sea turtles.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Bill Kole on Twitter at https://twitter.com/billkole ."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Czech coalition government to survive no-confidence vote", "description": "The Czech coalition government is likely to survive a forthcoming parliamentary no-confidence vote after a junior party decided not to vote against it", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/czech-coalition-government-survive-confidence-vote-59341444", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:05:57Z", "content": "The Czech coalition government is likely to survive a forthcoming parliamentary no-confidence vote after a junior party decided not to vote against it.

It's a proposal that both the state teachers union and PTA oppose.\n\nGualtieri told The Associated Press this week he long believed only law enforcement personnel should carry guns at school, but his position \"morphed\" after studying other shootings and watching security video of the Feb. 14 Stoneman Douglas attack, which left 14 students and three staff members dead.\n\nHe said it \"gnaws\" at him that suspect Nikolas Cruz stopped firing five times to reload his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, but no teacher or other school employee could use those pauses to shoot Cruz. The athletic director and a coach, both unarmed, died trying to stop Cruz and at least one teacher minutes later would have had a clear shot.\n\nMeanwhile, video shows the Broward County sheriff's deputy assigned to the school drew his gun but stayed outside. By the time other law enforcement arrived, the final fatal shots had been fired.\n\n\"We know from the history of these things that the majority are stopped by school personnel,\" Gualtieri said, pointing to shootings where the gunman was tackled or disarmed by a teacher or campus employee. \"People need to keep an open mind to it as the reality is that if someone else in that school had a gun it could have saved kids' lives.\"\n\nAfter the shooting, Florida law was changed to allow school districts to train and arm employees other than teachers, including administrators, librarians and custodians. Teachers are barred unless they are former or current police officers, current members of the military or Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps instructors. Thirteen of the state's 67 countywide districts adopted the program, mostly in rural parts of the state.\n\nCurrently, teachers in 28 states can carry firearms, according to the Crime Prevention Research Center, a conservative nonprofit organization. District approval is required in most states and restrictions and training requirements vary.\n\nBoth the Florida Education Association, which is the state teachers union, and the Florida PTA oppose arming teachers, saying having more guns on campus will make schools more dangerous, not less.\n\n\"Teachers should not be acting as armed security guards. The majority of our members don't want to be armed \u2014 they know it would be impractical and dangerous,\" union spokeswoman Joni Branch said.\n\nAngie Gallo, the state PTA's legislation chair, said only law enforcement should carry guns on campus.\n\n\"Teachers need to teach,\" Gallo said. \"Their job is not to secure our schools. It is not to shoot at shooters.\"\n\nOther members of Gualtieri's commission, including Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, have expressed support for arming teachers, although it is unclear if a majority agrees.\n\nThe 15 panel members appointed by Gov. Rick Scott and legislative leaders include law enforcement, education and mental health professionals, a legislator and the fathers of two slain students. The panel, which has been meeting periodically since April, must file its initial report to Scott, incoming Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature by Jan. 1. It will consider proposals for adoption at its mid-December meeting.\n\nOther proposed recommendations include preventing outside attacks by limiting and staffing entrances; allowing all school employees to order a lockdown; improving campus communication systems; and tightening laws governing the assessment of students who may pose a threat. For law enforcement, the proposals include giving officers clear orders that they must confront active shooters, even if they are alone, and making sure first responders from different agencies have radios that can quickly be programmed to communicate with each other.\n\nCruz, now 20, has pleaded not guilty, but his lawyers have said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence.

The IRS has cleared up some of the mystery around sections of the law that affected small businesses, but owners need to crunch numbers to see how much of a break they're likely to get.\n\nSome tips about tax planning:\n\n\u2014 Don't do it alone \u2014 schedule an appointment with an accountant, tax attorney or enrolled agent.\n\n\u2014 As in any tax year, consider whether you should defer income until next year or move up planned 2019 expenses into this year. This means doing long-term planning. Owners should be thinking three to five years ahead, says Manuel Pravia, an accountant with MBAF in Miami.\n\n\u2014 If you buy equipment and deduct and/or depreciate the cost, it must be up and running \u2014 what the IRS calls \"placed in service\" \u2014 by Dec. 31.\n\n\u2014 Owners who want to make retirement plan contributions for this year have until the due date of their tax returns, including extensions. That could be as late as next October.\n\n\u2014 For sole proprietors, partners and owners of S corporations, in trying to determine if you can claim a 20 percent deduction of your qualified business income, remember that the tax break is based on all your taxable income. That includes your business income and earnings from work you might do separate from your company. A spouse's income goes into the computations. The amount you might be able to claim is affected by factors including the compensation you pay employees.\n\n\u2014 Owners tempted by a big drop in the corporate tax rate and considering converting their companies to what are known as C corporations should remember there's double taxation, says Julian Fortuna, a tax attorney with Taylor English in Atlanta. The company is taxed, and owners are taxed when they receive dividends.\n\n\u2014 Businesses can no longer deduct entertainment expenses like tickets to events or the cost of activities like golf. But food bought during an event \u2014 like hot dogs at a baseball game \u2014 is 50 percent deductible. So are meals.\n\n\u2014 You can get more information at the IRS website, www.irs.gov .\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

They worked together on the new Netflix Original docu-series \"Dogs,\" which dropped last week.\n\n\"We're in undeniably divisive times right now. We're all searching for something that everyone can agree on and dogs are probably about as close to that as we get,\" said Zipper, who executive produced the six-part project with Berg.\n\n\"My brother and I are on completely opposite sides of the political spectrum,\" he explained, \"but he's got five dogs and I've got my dog, Anthony. We start talking about the dogs and start feeling the love again.\"\n\nThe series is set around the globe, from suburban Cincinnati, Ohio, and the Lower East of Manhattan to Italy's Lake Como region and the dangerous streets of Damascus in Syria. There are human heroes, to be sure, but it's the howl of Zeus and the watchful diligence of Ice, the commitment of curly-haired Rory and the undying loyalty of Max that drive these stories.\n\nThe dogs themselves take you to the brink, serving to inspire and uniquely frame the nearly hour-long chunks of storytelling set in locations and around circumstances chosen with the help of a casting team, said Berg.\n\n\"We wanted to illustrate the connection between all cultures with dogs and humans, and the dog-human love story,\" Berg said.\n\nThere's plenty of love, and none of something in particular that's more often than not a standard in dog film fare through time: death. I repeat. NOBODY DIES. To heck with spoilers. No dog protagonists and no humans, either. That isn't to say that tears won't be shed, including by you if you're truly human, and that people and dogs aren't in danger or sick or depressed.\n\nBerg directed two of the episodes, including one focused on Zeus, a Siberian husky with the mournful cry of the breed. He's trapped in Syria after his master flees military service to Germany and that's where their story begins. She was also at the helm of an episode that follows a devoted Manhattan animal rescuer on a mission to provide second chances to 31 dogs from a Texas shelter, finding them homes around her city. The dogs have the names of famous singers: Jimmy Buffett, Jay Z and Justin Timberlake, to name a few.\n\nThe other episodes were directed by a variety of award-winning filmmakers, including one that uses drone footage to show us from above what it looks like to watch hundreds of former street dogs race happily along lush green hillsides at a 300-acre sanctuary in Costa Rica, and the financial struggles involved to provide them better lives.\n\nAnother episode takes us into the world of competitive dog grooming. It follows the journeys of two Japanese groomers, Miki in Hikone and Kenichi in Tokyo, to a competition in Pasadena, California, as it reflects on the Japanese culture's deep-rooted passion for dogs as more than just companions, but children \u2014 let alone the unique style there of shaping dog hair into masterpiece poofs with artful precision.\n\nKenichi is more than just a groomer. He whispers adoringly to his four-legged charges as he snips away, acknowledging: \"I'm not very good with people. I have a hard time talking to them. But when it comes to dogs, I can communicate well.\"\n\nService dogs also represent in the series. One Ohio family welcomes Rory into their lives to make life easier for a young girl with epilepsy.\n\nAnd that dog-human bond? It's alive and well and living on a fishing boat in the tiny Lake Como village of San Giovanni, where Ice (he loves snow) and his man have been working their nets for more than a decade, also serving up their catches in the family restaurant.\n\nFor Zipper, the series has brought him full circle, to his own human-dog bond with the now 16-year-old Anthony.\n\n\"For me, 'Dogs' was a very personal story. Before I was a producer, I was a prosecutor in Hudson County, New Jersey, and I came across a stray pit bull puppy on the streets of Jersey City,\" he said.\n\n\"That dog took me to the animal shelter, and I had never been in an animal shelter in my life. Once I was there, I was confronted by a world I didn't even know existed. In a matter of weeks, I had turned in my badge and started volunteering at an animal shelter. And a funny thing happened. For the first time in my life I was happy.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Do these 5 things by Dec. 31 to cut your tax bill", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Here are a few simple maneuvers that could save you a bundle on your taxes \u2014 if you make them by Dec. 31.\n\n1. MOVE MONEY INTO A 401(K)\n\nTraditional 401(k)s can shield a decent chunk of your income from taxes. In 2018, you can funnel up to $18,500 ($24,500 if you're 50 or older) of your pay into one and avoid paying taxes on that money until you withdraw the funds. If your employer offers a match on contributions, you'll get free money to boot, and those matching dollars are on top of the $18,500 limit.\n\nIf you don't have access to a 401(k), you may still be in luck \u2014 you may be able to shield up to $5,500 from taxes ($6,500 if you're 50 or older) by putting the money into a traditional IRA. If you qualify, the size of the tax deduction depends on your income and whether you or your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work. Bonus: You have until April 15, 2019, to move money into an IRA and still make it count as a 2018 contribution. (And yes, it's possible to contribute to a 401(k) and a traditional IRA in the same year.)\n\n2. BUNCH YOUR CHARITABLE DONATIONS\n\nItemizing on your taxes generally only pays off when your itemized deductions add up to more than the standard deduction (and in 2018, the standard deduction is much higher: $12,000 for single filers, $18,000 for heads of household and $24,000 for joint filers). That's why charitable donations and other itemized deductions might not get you much of a tax break if they're so small that you just end up taking the standard deduction instead. It's no reason to stop giving, but you may want to tinker with the timing.\n\nDonating one big amount instead of a series of small amounts could change the tax game, says Kerry Garner, a CPA at Patterson Hardee & Ballentine in Franklin, Tennessee. A married couple might not score a tax break from a $15,000 annual donation, for example, but bunching the donations into a $30,000 gift every other year could, he notes.\n\n3. SELL THE LOSERS\n\nIf you made money on the sale of investments in 2018, you might have some capital gains tax to pay in April. But you might be able to offset some of those gains with losses.\n\n\"If you've got an event that generates a significant capital gain during 2018 \u2014 maybe that happened earlier in 2018 or sometime throughout the year \u2014 to the extent that you've got investment holdings that are sitting at a loss position, it makes sense to liquidate those losses during the year to offset capital gains,\" explains Nicholas Shires, a CPA and tax partner at Dannible & McKee in Syracuse, New York. If your losses exceed your gains, you may be able to deduct the difference on your tax return, up to $3,000 per year ($1,500 for those married filing separately).\n\n4. MAKE A DECISION ON THAT DIVORCE\n\nIf you're still negotiating with your soon-to-be ex and expect to pay or receive alimony, keep an eye on the calendar. In general, for divorces finalized after Dec. 31, alimony payers will no longer be able to deduct their payments, and alimony recipients will no longer have to include that money as taxable income. \"If you're the one that's going to be paying the alimony, you would want it to be finalized prior to December 31, 2018,\" Shires says.\n\n5. MEET YOUR TAX PREPARER\n\nThe sooner your tax preparer has an idea of how your year is shaping up, the sooner he or she can find you more ways to save. That's especially true for people who are self-employed or have unusual sources of income, Garner notes. \"I try to do it the first week of December, so it still leaves them plenty of time to actually get things done,\" he says.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet .

Owners who don't have regular conversations with tax advisers may not understand the changes, many of which are significant and complex, says Chris Jackson, CEO of Lionshare Partners, a financial planning service.\n\n\"They look at just the brackets and think 'the brackets went down, by default the amount I'll pay will go down,'\" says Jackson, whose Los Angeles-based practice includes small business owners.\n\nThe IRS began issuing guidelines for complying with key sections during the summer, and tax pros have helped many owners estimate what this year's tax bill will be. A look at some of the tax issues owners need to consider, and the benefits some are already getting:\n\nTHE SMALL BUSINESS DEDUCTION\n\nA critical question for owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships and what are known as S corporations is whether they can claim a new deduction aimed at small business owners. The law allows owners of many of these companies to deduct 20 percent of what's known as qualified business income. But the IRS' guidelines set income thresholds \u2014 $157,500 for an individual and $315,000 for a married couple filing jointly. Owners with taxable income up to those amounts can take the full deduction, and a partial deduction is possible above those limits.\n\nThe calculations for the deduction are complex, and there's a wrinkle for owners whose companies are what's called a specified service trade or business \u2014 for example, health providers, attorneys, accountants or consultants. They have no deduction if their taxable income is more than $207,500 for an individual or $415,000 for a married couple.\n\nThe amount of the deduction may be affected by the compensation owners pay their employees. And owners with multiple businesses also must determine which of their income sources qualify for the deduction, says Ken Rubin, an accountant with Rubin Brown in St. Louis.\n\nWhile the IRS guidelines have ended some uncertainty about the deduction, \"the question now is, 'how can I be sure that I'm legitimate in taking it,'\" Rubin says.\n\nSHOULD I INCORPORATE?\n\nThe law provides for a big reduction in the corporate tax rate, to 21 percent from 35 percent. That had many owners asking tax pros whether they should convert their sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations to what are called C corporations to take advantage of the lower rate. Probably not, was the answer. C corporations, the structure used by the nation's biggest companies, are taxed on their income, and their shareholders, including some small business owners, must then pay tax on dividends.\n\n\"While some people may have been thinking a C corporation may be better, the double tax part of it knocks out a lot of the opportunity for savings,\" says Manuel Pravia, an accountant with MBAF in Miami.\n\nThere may be some businesses that will benefit from becoming C corporations, says Julian Fortuna, a tax attorney with Taylor English in Atlanta. An owner who expects to take a company public needs to structure it as a C corporation. An owner who doesn't plan to pay dividends doesn't have to worry about double taxation.\n\nStill, Fortuna says, \"only for a small percentage have we advised that it makes sense to become a C corporation.\"\n\nCAN I DEDUCT THAT LUNCH?\n\nIt was clear when the law was enacted that companies could no longer deduct the cost of entertaining clients; there'd be no more breaks on theater or sports tickets or golf fees. It wasn't clear until the IRS issued guidelines last month that money spent on food \u2014 taking clients out to dinner or bringing in meals for staffers \u2014 would still be 50 percent deductible.\n\nJackson is spending less on entertaining his financial planning clients and more on taking them out for meals following the change. But Leslie Saul, who owns an architecture and design firm bearing her name, is shrugging off concerns about deductions.\n\n\"Whether or not our meals are 50 percent deductible or zero percent deductible, we will continue to bring in food for staff meetings and for client meetings. It's the cost of doing business,\" says Saul, whose company is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nPUTTING TAX SAVINGS TO USE\n\nMany companies that began crunching numbers immediately after the law took effect are already using their tax savings. Digital Media Solutions raised the pay of its hourly workers and renovated break rooms and other parts of the marketing company's premises, CEO Joe Marinucci says.\n\n\"We knew what the impact was going to be and how much more cash flow we were going to have,\" says Marinucci, whose company is based in Clearwater, Florida.\n\nPaul Allen learned soon after the law was enacted that there was a break for small producers of beer, wine and liquor: Tax on the beverages they make was slashed by 80 percent to $2.70 a gallon from $13.50. He factored that into the strategy for his company, Hope Springs Distillery, which began producing gin, absinthe and vodka last year.\n\n\"We decided to use the cost reduction to lower our selling prices, which has helped us to be much more competitive,\" says Allen, whose company is located in Lilburn, Georgia.\n\nBefore the break, the tax was Allen's biggest expense. By cutting his prices on his Top Hat vodka from $23 to $20 a bottle, Allen says he's now able to better compete with national brands.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

The island is home to the indigenous Sentinelese people.\n\nThe seven fishermen who escorted Chau to the island, which is illegal to visit, have all been arrested, Singh said.\n\nIt appears that Chau reached the island with the help of \"local friend\" and electronics engineer named Alexander, a local water sports guide named Saw Remmis and five fishermen, Dependra Pathak, director of India\u2019s Andaman & Nicobar Police, said in a statement. The men \"actively facilitated\" and accompanied him to the North Sentinel Island under the guise of a fishing activity to evade authorities, Pathak said.\n\n\"Despite knowing fully well about the illegality of the action and the hostile attitude of the Sentinelese tribesmen to the outsiders, these people collaborated with John Chau for this visit to North Sentinel Island without any permission from the authorities,\" Pathak said.\n\nChau paid the local fishermen 25,000 Indian rupees, about $350, to accompany him on the journey, Pathak said.\n\nHe arrived to the Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands on Oct. 16 but had been to the islands a few times before, Pathak said.\n\nThe group set off for the forbidden islands around 8 p.m. on Nov. 14, Pathak said. The next morning, Chau headed toward the shore on kayak, which had been towed by the fishing boat, and the group planned to meet later between the shoreline and their high sea fishing area, Pathak added.\n\nOn Saturday, the fishermen saw a dead body being buried at the shore, and they determined that it was likely Chau based on the \"silhouette of the body, clothing and circumstances,\" Pathak said.\n\nThe fishermen then returned the Port Blair on the South Andaman Island and informed the electronics engineer Alexander of what transpired. Alexander passed on the information to another friend, who then informed Chau's parents, Pathak said.\n\nPolice have not yet located Chau's body and \"a murder case has been registered,\" Singh said.\n\n\"We don\u2019t know much about him. But he was kind of a missionary preaching Christianity,\" Singh said.\n\nThe U.S. Consulate in Chennai, India, said it was \"aware of reports\" about the case.\n\n\"We are aware of reports concerning a U.S. citizen in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad is one of the highest priorities of the U.S. Department of State,\" a consulate spokesperson told ABC News. \"When a U.S. citizen is missing, we work closely with local authorities as they carry out their search efforts. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.\"\n\nIndian Coast Guard/Reuters, FILE\n\nThe Sentinelese people are a hunter-gatherer tribe who have historically lived on the island in the Bay of Bengal, but other than that very little is known about them, according to Sophie Grig, a senior researcher at Survival International, an indigenous peoples' charity.\n\n\"They are the most isolated tribe in the world,\" Grig told ABC News. \"They live on a completely isolated island and they have always historically fired arrows at anybody who has tried to land on the island or get near them.\"\n\nPathak described the indigenous people as having \"vigorous rejection toward outsiders\" and said the land in which they live on is a \"highly restricted area.\"\n\nBecause of their isolation, Survival International has warned that the Sentinelese people are extremely vulnerable to disease from outsiders, and it is illegal to travel to North Sentinel or attempt to make contact with the islanders.\n\nChau traveled to the remote island to spread Christianity, Mat Staver, founder of Covenant Journey, a religious group Chau once traveled to Israel with, said in a statement. Chau brought gifts for members of the indigenous tribe and carried his Bible with him on the island in an effort to \"befriend the Sentinelese to share Jesus with them,\" Staver said.\n\n\"He was willing to give his life to share Jesus with the people on North Sentinel island,\u201d Staver said. \"Ever since high school, John wanted to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with this indigenous people.\"\n\nChau was a \"beloved son, brother, uncle and best friend,\" his family wrote in a statement on his Instagam account, adding that they \"forgive those responsible for his death.\"\n\n\"To others he was a Christian missionary, a wilderness EMT, an International soccer coach, and a mountaineer,\" the statement read. \"He loved God, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.\"\n\nChau attended Christian liberal arts school Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he received a degree in sports medicine, and had expressed a desire to obtain a medical degree at Loma Linda University in Southern California, Staver said.\n\nIn a statement, Chau's alma mater said it was \"not surprised\" that he tried to reach the isolated tribe.\n\n\"Oral Roberts University alumni have gone to the uttermost bounds of the earth for the last 50 years bringing hope and healing to millions,\" said Oral Roberts University President Dr. William M. Wilson. \"We are not surprised that John would try to reach out to these isolated people in order to share God\u2019s love. We are deeply saddened to hear of his death.\"\n\nIn a similar incident, two Indian fishermen were killed in 2006 after landing on the North Sentinel island. In that case, no attempts were made to collect them, according to Grig.\n\n\"It is completely impractical to be able to charge them with murder,\" said Grig. \"They have absolutely no idea that the Indian state exists, let alone what the laws are.\"\n\nABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Bill Hutchinson, Josh Margolin and Aaron Katersky", "title": "Mansion fire being probed as quadruple homicide", "description": "A New Jersey mansion fire that killed four people is being probed as a homicide.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/jersey-mansion-fire-probed-quadruple-homicide/story?id=59339131", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/fatal-mansion-fire-nj-01-wabc-jc-181120_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:19:11Z", "content": "A blaze that ripped through a New Jersey mansion and killed four people, including two children, is being investigated as a homicide, according to law enforcement sources.

It is the largest dowry ever paid in the civil war-torn country, the government said.\n\nThe highest bidder was a man three times the 17-year-old's age. At least four other men in Eastern Lakes state competed, said Philips Anyang Ngong, a human rights lawyer who tried to stop the bidding last month. Among the bidders was the state's deputy governor.\n\n\"She has been reduced to a mere commodity,\" Ngong told The Associated Press, calling it \"the biggest test of child abuse, trafficking and auctioning of a human being.\" Everyone involved should be held accountable, he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Nyalong became the man's ninth wife. Photos posted on Facebook show her sitting beside the groom, wearing a lavish dress and staring despondently at the floor. The AP is using only her first name to protect her identity. The groom did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSouth Sudan has a deeply rooted cultural practice of paying dowries for brides, usually in the form of cows. It also has a long history of child marriage. Even though that practice is now illegal, 40 percent of girls still marry before age 18, according to the United Nations Population Fund. The practice \"threatens girls' lives\" and limits prospects for their future, said Dr. Mary Otieno, the agency's country representative.\n\nThe bidding war has caused local and international outrage. It took several days for Facebook to remove the post that first pointed out the auction, and after it was taken down other posts \"glorifying\" the situation remained, George Otim, country director for Plan International South Sudan, told the AP.\n\n\"This barbaric use of technology is reminiscent of latter-day slave markets. That a girl could be sold for marriage on the world's biggest social networking site in this day and age is beyond belief,\" he said. The auction was discussed, not carried out, on the site.\n\nFacebook did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nWhile South Sudan's government condemns the practice of child marriage it says it can't regulate communities' cultural norms, especially in remote areas.\n\n\"You can't call it bidding as if it was an auction. It's not bidding. If you see it with European eyes you'll call it an auction,\" government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told the AP. \"You have to see it with an African eye, as it's a tradition that goes back thousands of years. There's no word for it in English.\"\n\nSome local lawmakers and activists disagree. In a statement released this week, the National Alliance for Women Lawyers in South Sudan called upon officials to comply with the government's plan to end child marriage by 2030. Ending the practice includes putting a stop to the auctioning of girls.\n\nSouth Sudan's anti-human trafficking chief called the case reminiscent of others he has seen across the country, in which girls are forced or tricked into marriage after being told they are going to live with relatives and go to school instead.\n\n\"It is clear that some human trafficking practices are hidden in our culture,\" John Mading said.\n\nIn other cases, some girls who grow up in the South Sudanese diaspora are brought back to the country and forced to marry. The AP spoke with several people who know girls who arrived for what they thought was a vacation, only to have their passports taken away and forced into marriage by their families.\n\n\"Some families want children to marry in their countries and in their ethnic communities, but most do it if the kids are misbehaving,\" said Esther Ikere Eluzai, undersecretary for South Sudan's ministry of gender.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Africa"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Ryan March", "title": "\u2018Ralph Breaks the Internet\u2019 \u2013 Balancing Humor With Heart", "description": "While trailers for \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d showcase the film\u2019s envelope-pushing approach to humor, balancing that humor with heart remains a hallmark of Disney Animation.", "url": "https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2018/11/ralph-breaks-the-internet-balancing-humor-with-heart/", "urlToImage": "https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/euyghvmbyu4ty986.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:03:00Z", "content": "While trailers for Ralph Breaks the Internet showcase the films envelope-pushing approach to humor, balancing that humor with heart remains a hallmark of Disney Animation.

It was music,\u201d Disney expert Jeff Kurtti said. \u201cThe connection to that music in the film has a great deal to do with how the story of the film was developed.\"\n\nJay Maidment/Disney Pictures\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, who plays lamplighter Jack in \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d was a big fan of the 1964 film and the music when he was growing up. \u201cThose songs have a hold on us. And then the incredible performances, from those incredible children to Julie Andrew and Dick Van Dyke \u2026it's just across the board wonderful.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just know those songs,\u201d said Emily Blunt, who plays the title character.\n\nHowever, Miranda confessed, there\u2019s one song from the first film that made him so emotional when he watched as a child that he would have to turn off the film.\n\n\u201c\u2019Feed the Birds,\u2019 ... was such a sad song to me growing up that I never saw the end of Mary Poppins until I was in high school [because] I would just turn it off. I would start crying and turn it off at \u2018Feed the Birds,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe songs of \u201cMary Poppins\u201d are the product of legendary Disney songwriters Robert B. and Richard M. Sherman, whom Walt Disney referred to as \u201cthe boys.\u201d\n\nThe songs of \u201cMary Poppins\u201d are so unforgettable, so what do you do for an encore?\n\n\u201cIt's an original musical. I think that's something that was sort of overwhelming at the first, because I thought, \u2018Well, here we are. We're writing an original musical for film,\u2019 which I'd never done before, said director Rob Marshall.\n\nWhen Marshall was searching for songwriters for \"Mary Poppins Returns,\u201d he handpicked two of the biggest \"Mary Poppins\" fans around, award-winning songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman.\n\nThe pair\u2019s clever and exuberant music powered the hit Broadway musical \u201cHairspray,\u201d which they followed up with musicals \u201cCatch me if you Can\u201d \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d.\n\n\u201cI honestly didn't know what I was gonna do if we didn't get [the job]. How do I live the rest of my life if we don't get this movie?\u201d Shaiman said jokingly. \u201cAnd am I gonna move to a hut on a desert island?\u201d\n\nWittman said the moment they were told they\u2019d write for the film was \u201cfantastic,\u201d quipping: \u201cBut then you have to write it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the pressure was on.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine for us, sitting down to write a new 'Mary Poppins' movie and thinking, like, 'How do we possibly try to compare?'\u201d Shaiman said. \u201cEventually, you have to stop thinking about that or the fear will incapacitate you.\u201d\n\nShaiman composed the score and the songs in the film and co-wrote the lyrics with Wittman. They spent months working out musical ideas with the performers, custom-fitting their songs to the actors\u2019 strengths.\n\nDisney\n\n\u201cIt was like getting the best musical-tailored suit possible,\u201d Miranda said.\n\n\u201cNormally, you really are flying by the seat of your pants when you do a film and there\u2019s no time to prep,\u201d said Blunt, who was filming the blockbuster \u201cGirl on the Train\u201d while working on \u201cMary Poppins Returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would come to us with ragged hair, having played a depressed alcoholic all day,\u201d Shaiman said, \u201cand then she'd be like, 'All right, I gotta be Mary Poppins!'\u201d\n\nIn the new movie, Miranda had the honor of singing the movie\u2019s opening number.\n\n\u201cLin's character welcomes us into the movie and into the time and place,\u201d Shaiman said. \u201cHe sings a very, you know, a sweet, gentle melody to welcome you into London.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we had maybe about 10 different numbers that we tried, because here we are launching into a sequel after 54 years,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cSo we really wanted to make sure we started on the right foot.\u201d\n\nJay Maidment/Disney Pictures\n\nIn the sequel, Blunt and Miranda also strapped on their dancing shoes.\n\n\u201cDancing was a new undertaking,\u201d Blunt said. \u201cI think Rob [Marshall] assumed that I could dance. But obviously, he'd never seen my dance, you know. So I think it was a bit of a risk he was taking, you know. But we really drilled those dances.\u201d\n\nRob Marshall said he knew she would be a good dancer. He said, \u201cI knew that Emily-- has style. I knew that she could sing. I knew she was musical, so I was not surprised that she could dance.\u201d\n\nMiranda said it was trial by fire when it came to the dancing.\n\n\u201c[They said] 'Here\u2019s your hat. Here is your cane. You\u2019re gonna be good at these things,'\" Miranda said.\n\nHe joked that it was \u201cjust after we wrapped\u201d that he was comfortable with the numbers.\n\nAudiences will get their chance to see those dances and hear the songs of \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d on Dec. 19.\n\nShaiman called the movie, \u201cOur love letter to the original film, the original filmmakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in there,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the audiences can rest assured that when they go see \u2018Mary Poppins Returns,\u2019 that they're not gonna get cheated out of anything they may wanna hear or wanna see.

The October drop led by a huge decline in the volatile areas of commercial and military aircraft.\n\nA category that serves as a proxy for business investment was flat in October after declines in both August and September. The slowdown has raised the specter that a widening trade war between the United States and China is causing U.S. companies to grow more cautious about committing resources to expand and modernize their operations.\n\nBen Herzon, executive director of US Economics Macroeconomic Advisers, said the number of risks to manufacturing was growing amid a stronger dollar, which makes American goods less competitive on global markets to worries about the U.S.-China trade battle.\n\n\"While the manufacturing sector is currently in good shape, headwinds are mounting,\" Herzon said. \"We expect strong momentum in the economy to overcome these headwinds and keep manufacturing on a firming trend, but we are watching developments closely for signs that this calculus could change.\"\n\nThe overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew at a strong 3.5 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter but this gain came despite the fact that business investment spending slowed sharply in the third quarter, to an annual rate of just 0.8 percent, the weakest showing in nearly two years, after an 8.7 percent surge in the second quarter.\n\nIn addition to the possible adverse effects from the U.S.-China trade war, economists said the investment slowdown could be an indication that the boost to investment spending stemming from the tax cut President Donald Trump pushed through Congress last year is beginning to wane.\n\nThe report on durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, showed that Octobers drop was the biggest setback since a 7.4 percent fall in July 2017.\n\nExcluding the volatile transportation sector, orders would have posted a tiny 0.1 percent gain after a 0.6 percent drop in September.\n\nIn transportation, orders were down 12.2 percent with demand for autos and auto parts edging up a small 0.2 percent while orders for commercial aircraft fell 21.4 percent and orders for military aircraft dropped an even bigger 59.3 percent.\n\nOrders for primary metals such as steel dropped 2.3 percent while demand for computers and related products rose 1 percent.\n\nIn a separate report, the Labor Department said that new applications for unemployment benefits rose for a second week, up by 3,000 to a still-low 224,000. Benefit applications, which are a proxy for layoffs, have been at ultra-low levels for an extended period, reflecting the fact that the nation's unemployment rate has fallen to the lowest level in nearly five decades."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Mali's central region facing unprecedented violence: Report", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

She also told an acquaintance in the parking lot that she was afraid before that person retreated to the hospital to call 911 as well.\n\nWhen Lopez confronted her, the former couple argued about O'Neal calling off the engagement, and Lopez demanded that she return the engagement ring. Then, police said, people inside and around the hospital heard gunfire.\n\nO'Neal fell to the ground. Witness James Gray looked out of the hospital window to see where the gunshots had come from and watched as Lopez \"stood over her and shot her three more times,\" he told reporters.\n\nAs a squad car pulled up, Lopez turned his Glock semi-automatic handgun on police, striking the vehicle multiple times before he ran into the hospital. Officers gave chase.\n\nOnce inside the medical center, he kept firing at officers and at one point turned and fired at Dayna Less, a first-year resident in the hospital's pharmacy, when the doors of the elevator she was on opened.\n\nOfficer Samuel Jimenez was struck in the neck, just above the bulletproof vest he was wearing, and soon died. Jimenez had been delivering his station's mail to the post office when he turned and followed other squad cars racing to the hospital.\n\nThere were indications that Lopez wanted to shoot even more people, including an account from one witness, Jennifer Eldridge, who was hiding in the pharmacy, when she heard the gunfire and the sound of the gunman jiggling the handle of the locked door, an apparent effort to get in.\n\nDuring the exchange of gunfire, Lopez was shot once in the abdomen. It was then that Lopez, who fired a total of more than 30 shots and had reloaded his weapon, put the gun to his head and killed himself, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Tuesday.\n\nInvestigators said they found nothing to indicate that Lopez had a criminal record. At the time of his death, he was an employee with the Chicago Housing Authority, and officials there said there had been no reports of any problems in his nine months on the job.\n\nBut there were other signs of trouble in recent years.\n\nIn 2014, Lopez was kicked out of the city's firefighting academy after threatening a female cadet. When the fire department learned of the threats, Lopez was told he would be disciplined. But instead of returning to the academy to meet with department officials, Lopez went AWOL and was fired, fire department spokesman Larry Merritt said Tuesday.\n\nRecords from that same year indicate that a girlfriend of Lopez sought an order of protection against him because he was incessantly texting her. When she reported the texts to police, officers told her to change her phone number and seek an order of protection. Records show that she sought the order but not whether she ultimately received one, Guglielmi said.\n\nLopez had a permit to possess a concealed firearm, and it was unclear if officials knew about the 2014 complaint when the permit was granted, said Guglielmi, who said Lopez had legally purchased four guns in the last five years. It was also unclear whether an order of protection, if granted, would have forbidden Lopez from owning weapons.\n\nWhen it was over, the Chicago Police Department was grieving just days before Thanksgiving for the second officer in less than a year to be killed in the line of duty. Cmdr. Paul Bauer was fatally shot in February while pursuing a suspect in the Loop business district.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson wanted the city to know just how heroic Jimenez and the other officers who chased Lopez were.\n\n\"They saved a lot of lives because we just don't know how much damage he was prepared to do,\" Johnson said late Monday.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel, speaking at the same news conference at the hospital, reminded the city of what had been lost.\n\nThe three victims were \"all going about their day, all doing what they loved,\" he said. \"This just tears at the soul of our city.

Add United Kingdom as an interest to stay up to date on the latest United Kingdom news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nA British academic was sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday in the United Arab Emirates on charges that he was spying for the U.K. \u2014 a verdict that Britain described as shocking as it urged its Mideast ally to reconsider the decision.\n\nMatthew Hedges, a 31-year-old PhD student in Middle Eastern Studies at Durham University, was arrested at Dubai Airport on May 5 and has been held in detention since.\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had travelled to the UAE last week and discussed the case with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. He described the situation as \"unacceptable.\"\n\nHedges can challenge the ruling within 30 days.\n\n\"Today's verdict is not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom and runs contrary to earlier assurances,\" Hunt said in a statement which underscored his surprise at the decision.\n\nThe harsh verdict is unusual for a British national in the UAE who is not accused of a violent crime.\n\nThe emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai are home to large numbers of British nationals who work in a range of positions, from top management jobs and public relations to teaching and athletics. Ties between Britain and the seven emirates of the UAE run deep, dating back more than 200 years. The British were among the first contracted to help build the UAE's infrastructure after oil was discovered there in the early 1960s and retain a multimillion dollar arms trade.\n\nThe Muslim country on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula prides itself on being tolerant of foreigners, and of being tourist-friendly. But British nationals have run afoul of local customs and laws, which prohibit public intoxication, kissing in public and cursing at someone \u2014 which can all lead to arrest and deportation.\n\nThe Federal Appeals Court of Abu Dhabi said Hedges was found guilty of \"spying on the UAE and providing sensitive security and intelligence information to third parties.\"\n\nLocal papers say police secured evidence of his activities from Hedges' electronic devices and surveillance by Emirati intelligence. Durham University, meanwhile, said that there was no reason to believe Hedges \"was conducting anything other than legitimate academic research.\"\n\nThe UAE has come under criticism for its vast surveillance network. While it helps to track down criminals quickly and keeps the country among the safest in the world, the network has also been used to go after critics and those conducting sensitive research. Rights organizations and some academics have been barred from the country and stopped from conducting research on the conditions of laborers from countries such as India and Nepal who build high-rise towers and sprawling malls in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.\n\nA number of faculty and students at New York University have reportedly been barred from entering the UAE for work deemed critical of the government, despite the university having a campus in Abu Dhabi.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said Hedges was detained at Dubai International Airport as he was preparing to leave the country following two weeks in the UAE. His wife says he was doing fieldwork for his doctoral thesis on the impact of Emirati security and foreign policies.\n\nThe academic was charged after more than a month in detention, the group said.\n\n\"UAE rulers cannot claim to preside over a global knowledge and education hub while locking up academics for months in solitary confinement,\" Michael Page of Human Rights Watch said.\n\nBritain had until now been restrained in commenting on the case, citing ongoing legal proceedings. Officials have declined to comment on intelligence matters, in keeping with government policy.\n\nHedges' wife Daniela Tejada, who was in court, said she was in \"complete shock.\"\n\n\"Matthew is innocent,\" she said. \"The Foreign Office know this and have made it clear to the UAE authorities that Matthew is not a spy for them.\"\n\nUrging the British government to make a stand for him, she added: \"I am very scared for Matt. I don't know where they are taking him or what will happen now. Our nightmare has gotten even worse.\"\n\nHunt said the case would have consequences for bilateral relations.\n\n\"I have repeatedly made clear that the handling of this case by the UAE authorities will have repercussions for the relationship between our two countries, which has to be built on trust,\" Hunt said. \"I regret the fact that we have reached this position and I urge the UAE to reconsider.\"\n\nHunt said on Twitter that he would meet with Hedges' wife on Thursday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Romania agrees to support EU migration reforms", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

They were sent to hundreds of front-line brothels called \"comfort stations\" to provide sex for the Japanese army that invaded and occupied Asian countries from the early 1930s through the end of World War II.\n\nWartime documents show that Japan's military supervised the brothels, and set the tariffs, service hours and hygiene standards. Government documents say the purpose was to keep soldiers from raping women and triggering anti-Japan sentiment, as well as preventing venereal disease and Chinese espionage.\n\nInitially, some were professionals or from poor Japanese families, historians say. In South Korea, they were often deceived by local agents who recruited them promising factory work. Later in the war, many minors in the Philippines were kidnapped, raped or tricked into working in the brothels, some victims said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJAPAN'S STANCE\n\nJapan's government has repeatedly denied there was any coercion, and more recently has refused to use the term \"sex slave\" for the women in English media and U.N. documents.\n\nJapan has intensified its stance in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's nationalist government, which says there is no official record showing the wartime government's systematic use of coercion. Some ultra-right-wing lawmakers say the South Korean women forced to work in the brothels were all prostitutes, and there is increasing bashing of supporters of the survivors, as well as journalists for writing stories about them.\n\nThe issue flared in 2014 after a former reporter from Japan's left-leaning Asahi newspaper was accused of fabricating his report on the first South Korean survivor who came forward, leading to defamation lawsuits still pending in Japan.\n\nStatues honoring the victims erected in the U.S. and elsewhere by South Korean groups have also upset the Japanese government.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTHE WOMEN'S DEMANDS\n\nThe former victims have demanded compensation and an apology from Japan's government. Japan in 1995 set up the semi-government Asian Women's Fund, a scheme to finance compensatory projects for victims from across Asia, including South Koreans.\n\nIn all, the fund paid nearly 5 billion yen ($44.2 million) for medical and welfare projects for all the recognized women from across Asia, including 61 South Koreans. But many others in South Korea rejected the fund because of pressure from their support group's policy to keep demanding official compensation.\n\nEstimates by historians for the total number of victims range from 20,000 to 200,000. In South Korea, about 240 women came forward and registered with the government as victims, and only 27 of them are still alive.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTHE 2015 DEAL\n\nUnder the agreement reached in December 2015, Japan pledged to fund a Seoul-based foundation to help support the victims. However, Japan said it didn't consider the 1 billion yen it provided to the fund as compensation, insisting that all wartime compensation issues were settled in a 1965 treaty that restored diplomatic ties between the countries and was accompanied by more than $800 million in economic aid and loans from Tokyo to Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea, in exchange, vowed to refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue and will try to resolve a Japanese grievance over a statue of a girl representing victims of sexual slavery that sits in front of the Japanese Embassy in downtown Seoul.\n\nThe deal initially described by Seoul and Tokyo as \"final and irreversible\" turned out to be anything but. Many victims refused payment. Anti-Japan activists rallied furiously, accusing the government of former conservative President Park Geun-hye of \"selling away\" the honor and dignity of the aging victims. College students began camping out in the street across the embassy to protect the statue from potential attempts to remove it. A 64-year-old Buddhist monk died after setting himself on fire to protest the deal in January 2017.\n\nJapan expressed anger that South Korea didn't taken specific steps to remove the statue and similar monuments in other places in the country, insisting there has been a clear understanding to do so.\n\nLiberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who won office in May last year following Park's removal from office over a corruption scandal, said in December 2017 that the 2015 agreement was seriously flawed because Park's government failed to properly communicate with the victims before reaching the deal.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHISTORICAL ISSUES\n\nThe legacy of sexual slavery is hardly the only issue of contention between South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe countries are at odds over a ruling by Seoul's Supreme Court last month that a major Japanese steelmaker should compensate four South Koreans for forced labor during Japan's colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II.\n\nSeoul has also expressed resentment about Tokyo's territorial claims over the disputed eastern islands occupied by South Korea. Japan last month refused to send a warship to an international fleet review hosted by South Korea after Seoul requested the removal of the Japanese navy's \"rising sun\" flag, which many South Koreans see as a symbol of Japan's wartime aggression.\n\nSeoul and Tokyo's bitter disputes over history have complicated Washington's efforts to strengthen trilateral cooperation to deal with North Korea's nuclear threat and China's growing influence in the region. Japan has also expressed wariness over South Korea's outreach to rival North Korea in past months, stressing the need to maintain pressure until the North takes concrete steps toward relinquishing its nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\n\"The Moon government is trying to maintain a two-track approach \u2014 cooperating with Tokyo on security and economic issues, but firmly responding to issues surrounding history and territorial claims,\" said Bong Young-shik, an analyst at Seoul's Yonsei University.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYamaguchi reported from Tokyo."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "New oil price plunge sends ripples through global economy", "description": "Sharply lower oil prices are sending ripples through the global economy, lending more spending power to consumers shopping for Christmas gifts and making fuel cheaper for people in poorer countries.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/oil-price-plunge-sends-ripples-global-economy-59335770", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:39:11Z", "content": "Sharply lower oil prices are sending ripples through the global economy, lending more spending power to consumers particularly for Americans' big holiday shopping spree but potentially dampening investment in U.S. oil production.

So the driver of a midsize car or crossover is saving about $4 on a fill-up while drivers of bigger SUVs could save $7 to $8.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump took the opportunity to tweet: \"Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go lower!\"\n\nThe drop in prices, however, could also lead to less investment in new rigs in oil-producing U.S. states, offsetting the overall impact on economic growth.\n\n\"Lower oil prices are now a net drag on the U.S. economy. This is a huge break from the past,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nShepherdson said the oil price drop would soften growth \"at the margins\" as the U.S. slows once the boost from recent tax cuts fades.\n\nThe economic impact is also different this time for Russia, which fell into recession after the last oil slump. Analysts say the country, a major oil and gas producer, is more insulated from a market drop because it has found ways to balance the state budget at lower oil prices. That's one reason Russia has been pumping oil at top speed recently.\n\nThe International Energy Agency says abundant global oil supplies should be welcomed as insurance against market volatility. It says lower prices are also a big break for people in developing countries who have seen fuel prices rise due to a stronger U.S. dollar, the currency oil is denominated in.\n\nThe recent drop in oil has been driven by calls for major producers to increase production. The U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Russia have all stepped up output. One reason was fears of a price spike due to sanctions on Iran. But when U Trump imposed them Nov. 5, he added a six-month waiver for several countries that are major consumers of Iranian oil. Instead of spiking, prices have slumped. Concerns about slowing global growth have also weighed on prices.\n\nTrump may have contributed to the price decline with a tweet on Nov. 12 in which he said that \"hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production.\" Saudi Arabia's oil minister had said a day earlier the country planned production cuts.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is under pressure over the reported killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Turkey in October, adding another factor to the oil market equation. \"To avoid U.S. sanctions, Saudi Arabia may decide to backpedal on its intended production cuts,\" wrote analysts at Commerzbank.\n\nMore volatility could lie ahead. The IEA has warned that despite the temporary waivers, the U.S. still intends to block Iran's ability to export oil. Meanwhile OPEC, the cartel of oil-producing countries, could yet announce production cuts at its Dec. 6 meeting in Vienna. Commerzbank's analysts said that \"a production cut of at least 1 million barrels a day will probably be agreed there.\"\n\n\"We see the oil market as being in a phase of exaggeration and expect a noticeable price recovery after the OPEC meeting at the latest.\"\n\nThe U.S. oil contract traded at $54.62 a barrel in afternoon trading in Europe on Wednesday, up $1.19.

Add Interest\n\nAmnesty International said Wednesday it's enlisting the help of thousands of online activists to speed up its investigation into the U.S.-led campaign that drove Islamic State militants from their self-styled capital of Raqqa but left the Syrian city in ruins.\n\nThe London-based rights group said the new phase of its investigation enables thousands of online activists, using satellite imagery of the city, to map out the destruction over the four-month campaign, which ended in October 2017.\n\nThe U.N estimates that more than 10,000 buildings were destroyed\u2014 or 80 percent of the city. Amnesty's Strike Tracker campaign, in partnership with Airwars, would help narrow down when and where coalition air and artillery strikes destroyed buildings.\n\nAmnesty hopes to compel the U.S-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group to take greater responsibility and conduct its own investigation into the deaths of hundreds of civilians.\n\nThe coalition says it worked to avoid civilian casualties in Raqqa. Col. Sean Ryan, a spokesman for the coalition, said it is \"always willing to review if new evidence is reported.\"\n\nAmnesty said the scale of devastation in Raqqa is \"too large\" for its teams to do it alone.\n\nBy enlisting thousands of activists for the month-long project, Amnesty said it can save years of work by a small team of researchers processing endless amount of data.\n\n\"The Strike Tracker asks people around the world to join us to analyze one building at a time and establish when it was destroyed in a strike,\" said Milena Marin, senior adviser on Amnesty's Crisis Response team. The data would then be corroborated with other evidence, such as videos and strike and casualty reports.\n\n\"We are hoping to build a comprehensive picture of what happened last year and with the evidence to advocate the coalition, to again, admit responsibility in their operations,\" she said.\n\nIn an earlier phase of Amnesty's investigation inside Raqqa, the group provided new evidence that compelled the coalition to acknowledge 77 civilian deaths. In total, the coalition has acknowledged 104 civilian deaths from the hard-fought campaign.\n\n\"With bodies still being recovered from the wreckage and mass graves more than a year later, this is just the tip of the iceberg,\" said Marin.\n\nSome 2,500 bodies have been pulled from the rubble and uncovered in mass graves, and searches are still underway. Amnesty suspects hundreds of civilians died in the campaign.\n\nAmnesty hopes to publish results of the research early next year.\n\nRaqqa was the capital of the Islamic State group's self-styled caliphate, which once encompassed a third of Syria and Iraq. In recent years the group has been driven from virtually all the territory it once controlled, and holds just a few small, remote pockets in Syria.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOn the net:\n\nhttps://decoders.amnesty.org/projects/strike-tracker"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Rick Klein and MaryAlice Parks", "title": "The Note: Alarms blare for GOP in Mississippi", "description": "It's not just that the runoff is taking up brain-space, or resources, or requiring some presidential travel on the eve of next week's election.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-alarms-blare-gop-mississippi/story?id=59331346", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/mississippi-elections-ap-gty-er-181120_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:04:06Z", "content": "The TAKE with Rick Klein Interested in The Note?

Add Interest\n\nCue the Republican panic, right in time for a holiday weekend.\n\nWhat was supposed to be an election afterthought, with Republicans just needing the technicality of a runoff to keep a Senate seat in Mississippi, is developing into a potential nightmare scenario for the GOP.\n\nIt's not just that the runoff is taking up brain space, or resources, or requiring some presidential travel on the eve of next week's election.\n\nIt's that Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith has said and done things that make the Republican Party's strained relationship with voters of color even more fraught.\n\nHer comments about voter suppression and a \"public hanging,\" and now a picture where she tried on a Confederate hat, are scaring away backers -- and reminding Democrats of the stakes. The Democratic candidate in the race, Mike Espy, is hoping to break through in a way African-American Democrats in nearby Florida and Georgia weren't quite able to.\n\nAt their only debate Tuesday night, Hyde-Smith offered an apology \"for anyone that was offended,\" but went on to argue that her words were \"twisted\" for political means.\n\nEspy countered: \"It came out of your mouth. I don't know what's in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth.\"\n\nThere's no way to forecast turnout in a one-off election that takes place right after a holiday weekend. That has Republicans worried about a race that they weren't supposed to sweat.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nThis holiday week, instead of thanks, the Trump administration is doling out a lot of blame.\n\nThe frighteningly deadly California wildfires? Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed \"radical environmental groups\" out West.\n\nThe federal ruling striking down the administration's proposed asylum policy? \"This was an Obama judge,\" the president said.\n\nThe delay in finding Osama bin Laden? Clearly, every other Democratic president's fault.\n\nIronically, there seems to be blame to go around, except on the one issue that Congress is itching for the president to act on: the killing of a U.S.-based journalist that the U.S. intelligence community believes the Saudi Arabian crown prince personally green-lit.\n\nInstead of responding with sanctions, as several members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have suggested, Trump doubled down on Tuesday and said he had no interest in holding the leaders of the country accountable. Maintaining a good relationship with the Saudis was important for U.S. interests, the president said, even if that meant giving the prince an apparent pass on what looks like a politically calculated murder.\n\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe TIP with Kendall Karson\n\nAmid the fury over racially tinged comments and verbal sparring between the final two candidates of this election season -- Mississippi voters finally got to hear from GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy on the issues -- mainly on health care.\n\nDemocrats across the country staked the blue wave on the signature issue in 2018, campaigning on preserving the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut in deep-red Mississippi, the health care battle is far more complicated: The state is among the poorest in the country, but also voted for the law's fiercest opponent, President Donald Trump, by nearly 20 points in 2016, and against federal Medicaid expansion.\n\nAlthough Espy shies away from using the terms Affordable Care Act or Obamacare on the trail, the issue remains a cornerstone of his campaign. Tuesday night, he sought to boast his commitment to protecting pre-existing conditions because he has one: a condition that gives him his raspy voice.\n\nFor her part, Hyde-Smith aimed to cast her challenger as too liberal for Mississippi, hoping that Espy's support for Obamacare will rev up her base in the final week before the runoff.\n\nBut when asked, in a prepared question by Espy, if she knew exactly what she cast a vote against -- when the Senate took up a Democratic bill in October that would eliminate short-term health care plans that don't cover pre-existing conditions and ultimately failed -- she responded without hesitation.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" she said, \"I knew what I was voting for.\"\n\nBrandon Dill/EPA/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast.

She still can remember those moments well.\"\n\nThe story is as old as war itself: Children left behind by the soldiers who fathered them.\n\nKaine is among more than 6,000 children fathered by soldiers in a West African peacekeeping mission that came to Liberia in 1990 and left eight years later, according to a center set up to register and support them. A smaller number of children were fathered by members of a separate U.N. mission that emerged as Liberia struggled to emerge from a vicious civil war.\n\nMany of the Liberian children, now grown, have never met their fathers. Others were abandoned by their mothers and grew up as orphans. As they enter adulthood two decades after the peacekeepers' departure, they are the focus of new attention in a world coming to terms with sexual exploitation and abuse by soldiers sent to protect vulnerable communities.\n\nUnlike many of the Liberian children left behind, Kaine says his father looked out for him, asking if he could bring the boy and his mother home to where he lived.\n\n\"Family pressure and fears made my mother remain,\" he said pensively.\n\nEven the few details Kaine has about his father are inconclusive: The T-shirt worn by his father, Lt. Cpl. Taiwo-Oyetunji, still clearly bears the seal of the West African regional body ECOWAS, under whose umbrella the ECOMOG peacekeepers arrived. It's a shirt from Niger, though his father's ID says he is of the Yoruba tribe, from Nigeria. Kaine became emotional upon seeing an identity card with him pictured in his uniformed father's arms.\n\nThe young man recently made his way to a support center in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, that was set up to help the thousands of children left behind by peacekeepers.\n\nThe United Nations-ECOMOG Children Organization, or UNECO, encouraged soldiers to register themselves and their children. They say they registered more than 6,000 children and eventually set up an orphanage on Monrovia's outskirts.\n\nMany of the West African soldiers cooperated, while others had to be found to register, said Ciah Cole, who set up the center with her husband, the Rev. Abraham Cole. Still, it was not possible to register all of them and much of the material was lost over the years, severing any chance for the children to track their fathers down.\n\nLiberia was in turmoil for 14 years amid back-to-back civil wars that left an estimated 250,000 people dead and forced more than half a million to flee to neighboring countries. The first civil war, which began in 1989 and became one of Africa's bloodiest conflicts, led to a regional peacekeeping force that at one point reached 15,000 troops. A U.N peacekeeping mission later emerged, only to leave Liberia earlier this year.\n\nWhile many women were raped during the fighting, the thousands of peacekeepers' children were largely the product of relationships Liberian women sought out as a shelter from hunger and hardship. At the time, peacekeepers had some of the best access to food in Monrovia.\n\n\"People were starving. There was nowhere to turn and women had to look for different ways to survive,\" Cole said.\n\nThe relationships went against the code of ethics for both ECOWAS and the U.N., which forbid sexual contact with people under the peacekeepers' protection because the potential for exploitation and abuse was high. In the early 2000s, the U.N. refugee agency reported that peacekeepers and humanitarian workers in Liberia had demanded sex in exchange for food, medicines, shelter and education.\n\nEnforcing bans on such relationships remains a major challenge, according to an Associated Press investigation last year that uncovered roughly 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by U.N. peacekeepers in various countries over a 12-year period.\n\nIn Liberia, the thousands of children who resulted from those relationships have now been largely absorbed by society. Nearly 40 of them still live at the UNECO center, which is painted in the peacekeepers' camouflage colors. Over the years, the center has helped to raise many of the children with little financial support.\n\n\"When there is no father, no mother, you are handicapped,\" said 24-year-old Nana Addo, who was placed in the center by his mother in 1995. He has lost hope of ever seeing his Ghanaian father \"but if he's still alive and I see him, I will be happy.\"\n\nThe problem is larger than reported, but resources are scarce, said Cole.\n\n\"Many of the mothers are hiding, refusing to identify themselves because they say it is shameful and disgraceful that those solders had children by them but could not return to see what's happening to the children they left behind.\"\n\nShe called on governments that contributed peacekeepers to Liberia to assist the children, and urged Liberia's government to set an example.\n\nWhile a far smaller number of the children were fathered by members of the U.N. mission that arrived years later, the U.N. says it made outreach efforts so Liberian women could register any complaints of sexual exploitation and abuse and receive assistance.\n\nSpokespeople at ECOWAS headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria declined to comment to The Associated Press, saying they did not have the information needed to respond.\n\nSome former ECOWAS soldiers, however, remember relationships with Liberian women well.\n\nMamadou Dalaba, a former Guinean soldier, said many colleagues impregnated local women and left without telling them once the war was over.\n\nAnother who served in Guinea's first contingent of soldiers in 1990 said many men had children with Liberian girlfriends in Monrovia. The men looked after the children as long as they could before returning home, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nFor the Liberians left behind, those broken bonds still hurt more than two decades later.\n\nKaine, the young man who clings to his father's T-shirt and ID card, says he was fortunate to grow up with his mother. He wants to become a mechanic but says he had to leave school this semester due to lack of support. \"The country has become too tough,\" he said, shaking his head.\n\nHe, too, issued an appeal to all the peacekeepers who left Liberian children behind to come back and support them.\n\n\"In today's Liberia, depending on the government to help people like me is like relying on a broken stick to stand and walk,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPetesch reported from Dakar, Senegal.

She was told she was too old, so she searched for volunteer opportunities and could only find one: The Bob Hope USO at LAX, located at Los Angeles International Airport, where military members preparing to ship out or returning home could have access to phones, computers, bathrooms and food.\n\nAfter a year and a half of feeling like she was making a tiny bit of difference, Blashek was brought to tears by one service member who came in asking for a chaplain.\n\n\u201cHe was on emergency leave to bury his mother,\u201d she said. \u201cHis wife had left him, and his only child had died as an infant.\n\n\"He had no one in his life,\" she continued. \"And he said to me, 'For the first time in my 20-year career, I'm going back to a war.

She also included a personalized letter in each care package, thanking the recipient for his or her service.\n\nBut in those first few post-9/11 years of terrorism and anthrax scares, you couldn't send a package to the front lines without addressing it to someone serving. And that was an issue.\n\n\"I didn't know anybody in the military,\" she said. \"So that became another journey of trying to collect names and addresses.\"\n\nCarolyn Blashek\n\nQuickly though, and at a time when things didn't yet go viral, word spread. Blashek was flooded with not only names, but donations of sunscreen and socks and other supplies.\n\nShe said her living room was packed to the rafters with boxes, but she wasn't allowed to send just anything.\n\n\"No alcohol,\" she said. \"No pork products because most of these packages were going into majority Muslim countries. No overtly religious materials. And no pornography.\"\n\nOne day she heard about a shipment of sunscreen someone had donated, just sitting at an armory near her home. So she showed up and knocked on the door. It wasn\u2019t long before she moved her whole operation from her house to the armory and started recruiting volunteers to help stuff boxes.\n\nJason Nathanson/ABC\n\nNow, Operation Gratitude is a non-profit company with a chief executive officer (CEO) and a couple dozen employees, which to date has sent more than 2.1 million packages to military members, their families and veterans.\n\n\"We all assume that everybody's got a family and loved ones that send them letters and packages,\" Vietnam veteran Bob Donavan said at a recent Operation Gratitude volunteer day.\n\n\"It's not so. They really don\u2019t.\"\n\nKevin Carter\n\nAnd when service members get those Operation Gratitude packages, he said there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s more important that the snacks and socks.\n\n\"When you get that letter, and I can tell you from speaking to a lot of people that have come back out of the combat zones, it's either in their breast pocket over their heart, or in their helmet. That's how much that little letter means,\" he added.\n\nOperation Gratitude has since expanded their scope, now sending packages domestically to first responders as well as deployed military members.\n\nJason Nathanson/ABC\n\nThere are such volunteer days all over the country, where hundreds of people donate their time, stuffing boxes, stuffing bears for military children and coming together.\n\nPlay\n\nPeople of all economic backgrounds, races, \"and most significantly, of all political viewpoints,\" said Blashek.\n\n\"From the far left to the far right, and everybody is joined in common cause to say thank you.\"\n\nThis story will be featured in ABC Radio's three-hour special, \"America Gives Thanks,\" airing on ABC Radio affiliates across the country on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, Nov. 22."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "David Rind", "title": "'Start Here': Stock selloff, Khashoggi.

The rule says that applicants seeking to live in the U.S. from other countries or immigrants seeking to stay permanently should be denied if they will rely too heavily on government services, such as government housing, subsidized health care or food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP.\n\nRichard B. Levine\n\nThe current guidance says this rule applies mostly to people who receive cash assistance from the government. But the Trump administration proposed the change that would allow officials to consider more programs.\n\n\"It's not like things were hunky-dory for immigrants before then, and now it's just gotten so much worse,\" said Joel Berg, head of Hunger Free NYC, of the administration's new \"public charge\" rule. \"So you take people that are already scared and are coming from countries and are scared of their government -- for good reason -- and throw this on top of that, and it's truly a massive calamity.\"\n\nThe vast majority of people who use food stamps are U.S.-born citizens, mainly children and elderly adults. About 9 million people are legal immigrants or children who are American citizens, but their parents were born outside the country.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department, which oversees immigration, estimated in a proposal that 2.5 percent of immigrants in the U.S. -- more than 500,000 people -- would disenroll from public programs because of the change.\n\nA new survey from the nonpartisan policy group Children's HealthWatch found that even though more immigrant families reported they don't have access to healthy food on a regular basis, SNAP enrollment among immigrant families in the U.S. less than five years is down about 10 percent. The lead researcher Allison Bovell-Ammon said mothers born outside the U.S. reported \"extreme caution\" in participating in food-assistance programs.\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nAnd Rodrigo Aguirre, a case worker at the Spanish Catholic Center in Washington, said about half the families he talks to aren't comfortable applying for benefits. He said that mothers, especially, are afraid their information will be shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and that they could be separated from their children who were born in the U.S.\n\nStephen Knight, policy and partnerships director for the Alamada County Community Food Bank, said one woman called and asked for her mother\u2019s name to be removed from the food bank's database. He said she was afraid her mother would be deported because she accepted free food from the food pantry, even though it isn't connected to government programs.\n\n\"This is a blunt instrument -- it's spreading hunger among an incredibly vulnerable population, and it's just really an unacceptable public policy,\" Knight said in an interview with ABC News. \"All of us are struggling to try to counteract the fear that is coursing through these communities.\"\n\nJessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports the Trump administration's proposal and favors reduced migration to the U.S., said there's a lot of misinformation and hysteria about the policy change. She said she's seen reports of people dropping out of programs, but it's hard to pinpoint one reason for the trend and that some people might be self-selecting out of those programs.\n\n\"The rule does not aim to deny benefits to U.S. citizen children or others who might qualify for them,\" she said. \"Its purpose is to create a better way to evaluate which applicants for immigration benefits are going to qualify by showing that they're self sufficient.\"\n\nVaughan, a former consular officer who would evaluate visa applications, said caseworkers typically will look at an applicant's overall situation and that they wouldn't approve or deny a request only because they used food stamps or other programs.\n\n\"It would be one thing if you were getting every program on the books, and some people need that, but if they do they're not going to be eligible for a green card unless their total family resources are going to change so they will not need those resources any more,\" Vaughan said.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, whose department administers SNAP, said he would be concerned if legal residents were dropping out of programs intended to provide food and that when it comes to women and children we should \"lean on the side of compassion.\"\n\nJohn Moore/Getty Images\n\nThe Food and Nutrition Service, which manages SNAP and other programs, \"wants to ensure that all individuals eligible for our programs have access to the nutrition assistance they need to live healthy, productive lives,\u201d according to a USDA statement.\n\nBut anti-hunger advocates say that promise isn't enough and that because of fear, hunger is spreading in vulnerable communities. Eighteen percent of Hispanic households said in 2017 that they didn't have enough healthy food to eat on a regular basis, according to the Agriculture Department.\n\n\"You're asking someone to choose between their immediate needs, and the immediate needs of their kids, and the ability to stay in this country legally for the long term,\" Celia Cole, a policy expert with Feeding Texas, told ABC News. \"You're asking people to choose between their present and their future.

Serbia's EU neighbors Hungary and Croatia have been turning migrants back \u2014 Hungary has erected two rows of barbed-wire fence along its southern border while Croatian police routinely face accusations of violence against migrants, which they have denied.\n\nJami is currently staying in a small, government-run center in Bosilegrad, a remote mountain town in southeastern Serbia, on the border with Bulgaria. Jami's husband and adopted son are also there.\n\nMotivated rather than limited by her disability \u2014 her legs were paralyzed by polio \u2014 Jami has always been a fighter. She has earned a master's degree in chemistry; tested her boundaries with swimming and weight-lifting; and broken records by climbing nearly 2,000 steps of Tehran's landmark Milad Tower in 2013, pulling her body up by her arms.\n\nHer decision to try to seek more freedom and opportunities in the West reflects hopes harbored by many migrants who are ready to endure hardship and wait for months, sometimes years, for a chance to fulfil their dreams.\n\n\"I always wanted to be a girl who walks down the red carpet and is capable of making her dreams come true,\" Jami told the Associated Press in an interview. \"A girl who can turn her dreams into memories, in every sense of the word.\"\n\nFull of hope and anticipation, Jami smiled broadly while showing the visitors her many certificates of excellence from Iran. Carefully made up and elegantly dressed, Jami appealed to world governments and organizations to help her receive the medical care she needs and raise her above the limitations she said Iran has imposed on her.\n\n\"I am not a war refugee. I am not a Syrian or Iraqi. But the war I had to fight in Iran to make myself recognized was harder than any (other) war,\" she said. \"I want to go from here to a country where I am understood and my legal rights can be granted to me.\"\n\nJami came to Serbia in a surge of arrivals from Iran after the two countries introduced visa-free travel for each other's citizens last year. Serbia recently abolished the deal under pressure from the EU.\n\nMigration remains a source of division within the EU, although the numbers of people moving to the West have dropped dramatically since the mass influx in 2015 when about 1 million migrants entered Europe. Anti-migrant sentiments have been on the rise and countries like Austria and Hungary have announced they will not support next month a U.N.-backed global pact for orderly and safe migration.\n\nJami, though, is undeterred by narrowing options for migrants, and seems certain she will eventually succeed. She speaks with enthusiasm about her plans to conquer seven of the world's best-known tall buildings, including the Empire State Building in New York and Dubai's Burj Khalifa.\n\n\"When I was a child, it was my dream to climb up the steps of a slide and I never could do that,\" she recalled. \"The question 'Why can't I?' was a driving force for me.\"\n\nNow, Jami said, \"the world's tallest towers fill my dreams every night and I hand-walk their stairs in my sleep.\"\n\nJami's eyes filled with tears as she spread out a T-shirt with a drawing on one side depicting her as a girl looking at a children's slide from a wheelchair and the seven towers on the other.\n\n\"Every morning when I wake up I wait for someone to have faith in me and help me along the path of realizing my dreams,\" she said. \"I am sure this will happen.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "US says China hacking increasing ahead of Trump-Xi meeting", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Add Interest\n\nIn the battle for online privacy, Google is a U.S. Goliath facing a handful of European Davids.\n\nThe backlash over Big Tech's collection of personal data offers new hope to a number of little-known search engines that promise to protect user privacy.\n\nSites like Britain's Mojeek , France's Qwant , Unbubble in Germany and Swisscows don't track user data, filter results or show \"behavioral\" ads.\n\nThese sites are growing amid the rollout of new European privacy regulations and numerous corporate data scandals, which have raised public awareness about the mountains of personal information companies stealthily gather and sell to advertisers.\n\nWidespread suspicion in Europe about Google's stranglehold on internet searches has also helped make the continent a spawning ground for secure searching. Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory.\n\n\"For us, it's all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\" said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies.\n\nTraffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant's queries tripled to 10 billion in 2017. On a monthly basis, it's getting 80 million visits while requests are growing 20 percent. Leandri says the site now accounts for 6 percent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.\n\nQwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Google and use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\"\n\nThe site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian and plans to expand it to about two dozen other languages, for which results currently come from Microsoft's Bing.\n\nTo be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, California, accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.\n\nMojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month and search queries have quintupled over the past year.\n\nAnother British startup, Oscobo, does anonymous searches for U.K. users with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Google search results, stripping out ads and tracking.\n\nPat Walshe, a U.K.-based privacy consultant, has been using Startpage and Qwant for years and says has never felt their services were inferior to Google's.\n\n\"I don't think people would go back if they started using these sites,\" Walshe said. They're \"allowing you to have greater choice and control and should hopefully minimize the tracking,\" which means you'll no longer see, for example, the same ad for a pair of shoes following you around online, he said.\n\nWalshe likes Startpage's new \"anonymous view\" feature, which goes a step further by letting users browse a copy of a website from its search results, not the actual site.\n\nGermany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" site, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.\n\nOutside Europe, there's also U.S. site DuckDuckGo.\n\nSome privacy search operators say it's equally important to help users avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which content is pre-selected by the likes of Google and based on previous searches and other data.\n\n\"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Google today, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said.\n\nSome sites rely on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" \u2014 links from shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users. That's different from Google's behavioral, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive.\n\nMojeek has private investors. Founder Marc Smith, who began in 2004 with two servers in his bedroom, believes advertising is \"a necessary evil and we'll look for whatever route we can to avoid it,\" said marketing chief Finn Brownbill.\n\nIn Switzerland, a country whose banking sector became a byword for secrecy, Swisscows has thrived, with monthly search queries jumping by nearly half to 20 million from a year ago, said founder Andreas Wiebe, who also runs software company Hulbee.\n\nEven so, Wiebe said he met plenty of skepticism at the start. \"In 2014, I had people talking to me (saying) 'you're crazy',\" and that the project would be dead within a year. Instead, National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of U.S. government surveillance in 2015 gave it a kickstart.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Kelvin Chan at twitter.com/chanman"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Merkel says UN migrants pact is in Germany's interest", "description": "Chancellor Angela Merkel says it's in Germany's interest to support a U.N. agreement on migration that countries such as the United States, Hungary and Poland have rejected", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/merkel-migrants-pact-germanys-interest-59335333", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_94e042f8a94145faa4ee2824da76c730_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T09:41:18Z", "content": "Chancellor Angela Merkel says it's in Germany 's interest to support a U.N. agreement on migration that countries such as the United States, Hungary and Poland have rejected.

Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes. Seven Palestinians, including five militants, were killed, while a Palestinian laborer working in Israel was killed by a Gaza rocket. It was the heaviest fighting since the 2014 Gaza war.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the time was not right for a wider confrontation in Gaza, but he has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to a cease-fire.

We must strike hard to restore deterrence,\" Intelligence Minister Israel Katz told the conference. \"Any attack on Israeli soil must be met with a tough response ... if Sinwar or (Hamas political chief Ismail) Haniyeh were to fire a bullet or a rocket at a soldier or Israeli citizens they will pay with their heads.\"\n\nIsrael assassinated Hamas leaders Ahmad Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi in 2004, and tried to kill another leader, Khaled Mashaal, in 1997. The killing of senior members of the group has had no discernable impact on its operations or ideology.\n\nHamas has staged near-weekly border protests since March in an effort to lift the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after the Islamic militant group seized control of the coastal strip in 2007. The blockade has ravaged Gaza's economy, and Israel refuses to lift it unless Hamas disarms, a demand rejected by militant group, which is pledged to Israel's destruction.\n\nDemonstrators each week have approach the border fence, throwing firebombs, grenades and burning tires at Israeli troops. Israeli snipers have killed about 170 people, most of them unarmed. Israel says it is defending its border against attackers, but it has come under heavy international criticism for shooting unarmed people.\n\n\"Nobody wants war in Gaza now.

Interpol has faced intense criticism that countries like Russia have abused Interpol's system to go after fugitive dissidents.\n\nStock told reporters after the conclusion of Interpol's general assembly in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that \"it is fundamental to Interpol's existence that we are neutral and that we are independent.\"\n\nAddressing what he said was misinformation circulating in recent days, Stock said Interpol accepts \"the fact that systems can be improved\" but added this year alone the red notice and diffusion system helped lead to the arrest of 10,000 serious criminals.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nGermany is congratulating the newly elected president of Interpol and warning against politicizing the global police cooperation agency.\n\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said Berlin is \"convinced that Kim Jong Yang is a good choice\" and pointed to a \"clear election result\" in his favor.

The Tokyo District Court, cited in the report, declined to comment.\n\nUnder Japanese law, suspects can be held for 20 days per possible charge without getting an official indictment. Additional charges can be tagged on, resulting in longer detentions. Neither Ghosn nor Kelly has been charged so far.\n\nGhosn is being suspected of falsifying securities statements and underreporting $44.6 million in income from 2011 to 2015, and Kelly was suspected of collaborating with him, according to Tokyo prosecutors.\n\nThe maximum penalty, upon conviction for violating the financial laws, the suspected allegation, is 10 years in prison, a 10 million yen ($89,000) fine, or both.\n\nDespite the high-profile arrests, analysts said the impact on Nissan auto sales was expected to be minimal.\n\n\"I'd be surprised if it impacts car sales very much,\" said Christopher Richter, auto analyst for CLSA Securities Japan Co. \"Consumers are discerning enough to say: This car, the wheels might fall off so I'm not going to buy it. This car company, the executive might have done something kind of dodgy, but do I like the car or not.\"\n\nRichter noted sales dips that hit after previous Nissan scandals had been temporary. The deviations the automaker acknowledged in those scandals were more directly related to product quality, such as mileage, emissions and plant inspections.\n\nWhatever executives might, or might not, have been doing were apt to influence a car purchase less, Richter said.\n\nRenault SA of France, a partner since the late 1990s, now with a 43 percent stake in Nissan, retained Ghosn as chief executive in an emergency board meeting Tuesday, while naming an interim in his place. Renault's board also is requesting Nissan pass along details of its investigation.\n\nFrom the start, Nissan has sought to distance itself from the arrests.\n\nChief Executive Hiroto Saikawa denounced Ghosn and Kelly as \"the masterminds,\" and made clear he thought they should be removed at Thursday's board meeting.\n\nGhosn, 64, was sent in to Nissan by Renault in 1999, and served as Nissan's chief executive from 2001 until last year. He became chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two major automakers simultaneously. In 2016, he became Mitsubishi Motors' chairman.\n\nGhosn is credited for turning around Nissan from near-bankruptcy.\n\nKelly, 62, joined Nissan in the U.S. in 1988, and became a board member from 2012. His background over the years has been in human resources and alliance management. He has a law degree from Loyola University School of Law and a bachelor's degree in public administration from Augustana College.\n\nWhen Saikawa was asked how such actions could have gone undetected for five years, perhaps longer, he blamed a murky system of checks and balances at Nissan and stressed that power had been too focused with Ghosn.\n\nNissan's overall performance won't be hurt by the absence of Ghosn, \"as long as the executive team pulls together,\" said Janet Lewis, an analyst at Macquarie Research.\n\nThe fact the case was initially brought to attention by a whistleblower underlined how the system was working, she said.\n\nNissan shares tanked Tuesday after the scandal surfaced, falling more than 5 percent. The stock recovered moderately in Wednesday's trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, closing up 0.4 percent.\n\nMasahiro Akita, auto analyst with Credit Suisse, said he was stunned by the news of Ghosn's arrest.\n\nBut he believes much of the operations at Nissan will remain business as usual, while uncertainties about brand image remain.\n\n\"It's not realistic to think the alliance will suddenly change as it is now already operating,\" he said, noting the automakers share platforms, or the basic parts on which vehicles are built, as well as parts purchasing.\n\n\"You can't go back on it that easily.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Bring me the bleach: Investors seek stability as stocks fall", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Hello power plants and bleach.\n\nSince stocks began tumbling two months ago, investors haven't abandoned the market. At least, not all of it. In recent weeks, as they've pulled money out of funds that invest in go-go technology companies, they've also been buying utilities, companies that make everyday necessities for consumers and other stocks that tend to have smaller swings in price than the rest of the market.\n\nIt's part of a big shift in investor behavior as fears about rising interest rates, a global trade war and slowing economic growth around the world have roiled markets. The S&P 500 plunged a combined 3.4 percent Monday and Tuesday, with technology stocks again suffering particularly sharp losses, and the index has lost 9.6 percent since setting its record on Sept. 20.\n\nTechnology stocks' fall marks a big turnaround from earlier this year, and from much of the bull market that began nearly a decade ago. After leading the market higher on the backs of their strong profit growth, Facebook and other big-name tech companies have recently stumbled on concerns that increased government regulation will dent their profits, on top of all the other concerns dragging on the rest of the market.\n\nApple has slumped particularly hard on fears that its newest crop of iPhones isn't as popular as expected after phone-part suppliers gave discouraging forecasts. Apple has plunged 19.7 percent since the S&P 500 set its record two months ago, nearly double the loss of the index. Amazon, the third-most valuable U.S. company after Apple and Microsoft, has fallen 21.3 percent over the same time, during which it gave a forecast for revenue growth this holiday season that fell short of Wall Street's high expectations.\n\nAfter their years of eye-popping returns, those stocks had become some of the most popular to own among hedge funds, mutual funds and other investors. But just as they bought the stocks together on the way up, investors are now heading for the exits en masse as well.\n\n\"There's no doubt that tech companies are widely owned, people have made a lot of money on them and we're finally seeing for the first time where the rotation is having some legs,\" said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. \"They're selling the winners and redeploying the money somewhere else.\"\n\nFor now, at least, that somewhere else has been areas of the stock market seen as holding steadier during economic downturns. Last week, for example, investors plowed $1.47 billion into exchange-traded funds that focus on utility stocks. The thinking is that utilities' customers will continue to turn on their lights and buy power regardless of how many tariffs get placed on Chinese goods.\n\nUtility stocks have not only held up better than the rest of the market in recent weeks, they've been among the few areas to thrive. Shares of Duke Energy and Xcel Energy have both climbed more than 7 percent since the S&P 500 began its downturn after Sept. 20.\n\nBesides utilities, investors have also been putting money into real-estate stocks and companies that make everyday items for consumers, such as Church & Dwight. The maker of Arm & Hammer baking soda and Oxiclean stain fighters has climbed nearly 10 percent over the last two months. Clorox, which last month reported stronger profit than analysts expected, is up 5.1 percent.\n\nAll these companies are common fodder for \"low-volatility\" ETFs that have surged in popularity in recent weeks as investors seek out stocks that have historically had smaller price swings than the rest of the market. Last week, $1.3 billion went into \"low-volatility\" ETFs.\n\nAt the same time, nearly $500 million left technology stock ETFs. It's a huge about-face in interest. As recently as two months ago, these ETFs had attracted $8 billion in net investment for 2018. But subsequent waves of selling mean they're now down to $525.9 million in net investment for the year, according to Jefferies.\n\n\"These things had outperformed the S&P by a mile over the last three years,\" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Investment Management. But that's changed now. \"On good days they're not the leaders, and on bad days they're the laggards.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Baby dies in Bali after US woman allegedly threw it from car", "description": "Indonesian police say an American woman allegedly threw her 2-month-old daughter to her death from a moving car on the tourist island of Bali and then tried to kill herself by leaping from the car", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/baby-dies-bali-us-woman-allegedly-threw-car-59334537", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T07:44:38Z", "content": "Indonesian police say an American woman allegedly threw her 2-month-old daughter from a moving car on the tourist island of Bali and then tried to kill herself by jumping from the vehicle.

The United Nations says more than 1.3 million children have suffered from SAM since a Saudi-led coalition went to war with Yemen's Houthi rebels in March 2015.\n\nThe aid group said its \"conservative estimate\" was that 84,701 children may have died, based on historical studies that find that 20 to 30 percent of untreated cases lead to death. Save the Children says it calculated the figure based on the number of cases reported in areas where aid groups were unable to intervene.\n\n\"For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable,\" said Tamer Kirolos, Save the Children's Yemen director. \"Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop.\"\n\nThe war has given rise to the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Three-quarters of Yemen's people require life-saving assistance and more than 8 million are at risk of starvation. Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in the fighting.\n\nThe Associated Press has reported from areas of Yemen that are on the brink of famine.\n\nSave the Children blamed the widespread starvation on a Saudi-led blockade that was tightened a year ago after the Iran-aligned rebels fired a ballistic missile at the Saudi capital, Riyadh.\n\nThe charity also cited recent fighting in and around the port city of Hodeida, a lifeline through which Yemen imports some 70 percent of its food and humanitarian aid.\n\nIt said commercial imports through the rebel-held port have fallen by more than 55,000 metric tons a month \u2014 enough to meet the needs of 4.4 million people. Save the Children said it had been forced to bring supplies for the northern Yemen through the southern port of Aden, slowing aid deliveries.\n\nThe overwhelming poverty in Yemen, the Arab world's most impoverished nation, has compounded the situation.\n\nChildren \"have no access to food although it's available on the market .... families cannot provide for their children and cannot afford it,\" said Sukaina Sharafuddin, a Save the Children employee in Yemen's capital, Sanaa.\n\nThe fallout from the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate has drawn renewed attention to the war and devastation in Yemen. The United States has scaled back its support for the coalition and called for a cease-fire by the end of this month.\n\nU.N. envoy Martin Griffiths says both sides have agreed to attend peace talks \"soon.\" Griffiths arrived in the Houthi-held Sanaa later Wednesday for meetings with rebels, including their leader, Abdul-Malek al-Houthi.\n\nBut the fighting is still raging in Hodeida and other areas, and previous peace efforts have failed to produce any agreement to stop the violence."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "South Korean named Interpol president in blow to Russia", "description": "South Korea's Kim Jong Yang has been elected as Interpol's next president, edging out a longtime veteran of Russia's security services who was strongly opposed by the U.S., Britain and other European nations", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-korean-named-interpol-president-blow-russia-59334535", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_208ebb81eedd46bf928e83814fe12b03_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T07:28:20Z", "content": "South Korea's Kim Jong Yang has been elected as Interpol's next president, edging out a longtime veteran of Russia 's security services who was strongly opposed by the U.S., Britain and other European nations.

Now the pressure is on Kim and Interpol's day-to-day boss, Secretary-General Juergen Stock, to fix them.\n\nThe White House came out publicly against the candidacy of Kim's Russian rival, Alexander Prokopchuk. After the election, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Kim \"the right man to lead one of the world's most critical law enforcement bodies in its mission to preserve the rule of law and make the world a safer place.\"\n\nFor Interpol, the vote staved off possible collapse, after rumblings from some member countries about quitting the agency.\n\nThe vote shows that members \"thought really hard about whether they want to back away from this institution or make sure it's run properly and operate fairly,\"said Jago Russell, chief of Fair Trials International, which has championed and monitored Interpol's reform efforts.\n\nAuthoritarian governments have long sought to leverage Interpol's reach \u2014 and notably its system of \"red notices\" that flag suspects for arrest wherever they go \u2014 for political ends. While it has tried to clean up this system, it remains vulnerable to pressure from powerful member states: Its last president vanished in China in a possible political purge, while Interpol quietly looked on.\n\nStock, the secretary general, acknowledged that \"systems can be improved\" but stressed that Interpol's information-sharing systems have led to the arrest of 10,000 serious criminals so far this year. \"It is fundamental to Interpol's existence that we are neutral and that we are independent,\" he insisted.\n\nThat was a central argument for the U.S. and governments in Europe and elsewhere who lobbied against Russian security service veteran Prokopchuk. The Western powers warned that a Russian victory would have led to further abuses of Interpol by the Kremlin, seeking to go after political opponents and fugitive dissidents.\n\nRussia accused its critics of overly politicizing the vote and campaigning to discredit Prokopchuk, calling him a respected professional. Russian officials were subdued in their response to the vote, and it got only modest attention in the state-dominated media.\n\nSouth Korea's government called Kim's election a \"national triumph\" that could elevate the country's international standing. Kim secured at least two-thirds of votes cast at Interpol's general assembly in Dubai, though the agency does not release how member states voted.\n\nThe new president is unlikely to make immediate change, though. Kim had already been the acting president, and Interpol's president has more of an oversight role than a hands-on position. Meanwhile, Prokopchuk will remain an Interpol vice president.\n\nBut watchdog groups say there's no time to lose.\n\n\"Interpol has for too long traded on its James Bond image, the global good guys fighting crime,\" said Russell of Fair Trials International. \"That reputation needs to be underpinned with meaningful rules to prevent abuse. ... I hope that this vote further focuses the mind on the need to do that.\"\n\nKim will serve until 2020, completing the four-year mandate of his predecessor, Meng Hongwei, who was detained in China as part of a wide anti-corruption sweep there.\n\nBased in the French city of Lyon, the 95-year-old policing body is best known for its \"red notices\" that identify suspects pursued by other countries, effectively putting them on a global \"most-wanted\" list.\n\nCritics say countries like Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and China have used the system to try to round up political opponents, journalists or activists. Interpol's rules prohibit the use of police notices for political reasons, and the agency has toughened rules to enforce that.\n\nHowever, countries can issue requests \u2014 known as \"diffusions\" \u2014 that flag a person wanted for arrest, before Interpol reviews the notice, leading to what critics say is a major loophole in the system.\n\n\"We accept the fact that systems can be improved and recognize that a very small number of noncompliant red notices can seriously affect the lives of innocent citizens,\" Stock said.\n\nBill Browder, who runs an investment fund that had once operated in Moscow, says Russia used the diffusion system against him, which led to his brief arrest in Spain earlier this year.\n\nLawyers who have championed Interpol reform also welcomed the vote, as did Amnesty International's Denis Krivosheev, who said, \"If Russian law enforcement agencies engage in abusive practices, then the country pays with its reputation, and this is a stark reminder of it. To Russia it matters a lot, and this is obviously quite embarrassing.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCharlton reported from Paris.

The 26-year-old adventurer and Christian missionary then swam back to a boat of fishermen that was waiting at a safe distance.\n\nThat night, he wrote about his adventures and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to North Sentinel Island the next day, on Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn't known, but on the morning of the following day, the fishermen watched from the boat as tribesmen dragged Chau's body along the beach and buried his remains.\n\nDependera Pathak, director-general of police on India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, said Wednesday that the seven people have been arrested for helping the American reach North Sentinel Island, including five fishermen, a friend of Chau's and a local tourist guide. Visits to the island are forbidden by the government, and officials were working with anthropologists to find a way to recover the body.\n\n\"It was a case of misdirected adventure,\" Pathak said.\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can't be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak told The Associated Press.\n\nIn an Instagram post, his family said it was mourning him as a \"beloved son, brother, uncle and best friend to us.\" The family also said it forgave his killers and called for the release of those who assisted him in his quest to reach the island.\n\n\"He ventured out on his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,\" the family said.\n\nAuthorities say Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed in a hotel while he prepared to travel to the island. It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2015 and 2016. North Sentinel is part of the Andaman Islands and sits at the intersection of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, which also towed the kayak Chau used to reach the island the first time, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where they broke the news to Chau's friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nPolice surveyed the island by air Tuesday, and a team of police and forest department officials used a coast guard boat to travel there Wednesday and another trip was planned Thursday. Officials said authorities were exploring their options, since they cannot go directly to the restricted area and confront the tribespeople.\n\n\"We have to see what is possible, taking utmost care of the sensitivity of the group and the legal requirements,\" said Pathak.\n\nIndia has a very hands-off approach to the island's people. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore, but Indian media reports say officials did not investigate or prosecute anyone in the deaths.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on a tour of Israel to affirm their Christian faith. Chau went through that program in 2015.\n\n\"He didn't go there for just adventure. I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them,\" Staver said.\n\nChau was carrying a Bible that was hit by an arrow when he was first shot at by the tribesmen on Nov. 15, according to notes Chau left with the fishermen that Staver said he has seen.\n\nStaver said Chau's last notes to his family on Nov. 16 told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nOne of Chau's friends said the American spent a month at his home in Cape Town, South Africa, before going to India. Casey Prince, 39, declined to discuss what Chau told him about his upcoming travel plans, saying he would rather talk about the kind of man his friend was.\n\n\"If he was taking a risk, he was very aware of it,\" Prince said, recalling the time Chau told him about being bitten by a rattlesnake.\n\nThe two first met about six years ago, when Chau was a manager on the soccer team at Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma. Chau and others on the team traveled to South Africa to volunteer at a soccer development and social leadership program Prince founded, Ubuntu Football Academy.\n\nPrince described him as easy to like and driven by twin passions: a love of the outdoors and fervent Christianity.\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School. Phone messages left with relatives were not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\n\"He was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and best friend to us,\" the Chau family wrote in its Instagram post. \"To others he was a Christian missionary, a wilderness EMT, an international soccer coach, and a mountaineer. He loved God, life, helping those in need, and he had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.\"\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said the killing of the American should prompt Indian authorities to properly protect the lands of the Sentinelese.\n\n\"The British colonial occupation of the Andaman Islands decimated the tribes living there, wiping out thousands of tribespeople, and only a fraction of the original population now survives.

There, on the other side, the fight is raging to capture one of the militants' last enclaves.\n\nIraqi troops and Shiite militiamen outside Qaim watch over a giant earth barricade topped with barbed wire that runs along the long, featureless desert border, trying to prevent IS infiltration. Iraqi artillery and U.S.-led coalition warplanes bombard IS positions inside Syria, while Iraqi militiamen along with allied Iranian troops cross the border to back Syrian government forces there.\n\nThe battle on the doorstep means life in Qaim is still on hold, with residents waiting for their town to be rebuilt. There is still no central electricity, and running water works only intermittently. On the outskirts lie the wreckage of houses, their walls blasted open and roofs collapsed from bombardment during the assault a year ago by militias and U.S.-backed Iraqi troops who retook Qaim from IS.\n\nThe dusty, quiet streets are dotted with security checkpoints, manned by the military and the government-sanctioned, Iranian-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, who are viewed with deep suspicion by many in this Sunni Muslim town. Many checkpoints fly both Iraqi national flags and the militias' banners proclaiming Shiite slogans.\n\nOn the main commercial road, militiamen and Iranian fighters shop in the markets. One fruit seller, Nabil Mashhad, said that since he doesn't speak Farsi, he shows the Iranians the prices on his cellphone's calculator.\n\n\"The situation is bad,\" Mashhad said. \"Where are the services? The schools? There's no life. We're working just trying to get by.\"\n\nThe fight next door underscores the tenacity of the Islamic State group, a year after it was driven out of almost all the territory it once held, which at its height encompassed nearly a third of both Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe IS enclave across the border is the last area with a significant population that it holds, a 30-kilometer (20-mile) stretch of towns on the east bank of the Euphrates River.\n\nThe militants are surrounded. On one side are the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by American warplanes, who have been waging an offensive since mid-September. On the west bank of the river is the Syrian military, backed by Russian airpower along with Iranian troops and Iraqi militiamen.\n\nIS has fought back ferociously. Last month, it attacked under cover of a sandstorm and captured a number of villages from the SDF. During the fighting, the militants drove explosives-packed cars through tunnels to emerge at their opponent's lines and at one point lured SDF fighters into an ambush by sending a woman to cry for help, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group that monitors Syria's war.\n\nThe extremist group is estimated to have several thousand fighters, including many Iraqis, in the enclave. The Iraqi military believes senior IS leadership are among them, possibly top leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. IS holds one other pocket in Syria, but that is a largely uninhabited desert expanse surrounded by government-held territory.\n\n\"We never thought or said this fight would be easy. These are some of ISIS's most determined fighters, and they've had a lot of time to prepare,\" the deputy commander of the U.S.-led coalition, British Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, told The Associated Press.\n\nRetaking the enclave has also been slowed by the rivalries among the various forces besieging it, said Iraqi Gen. Qassim Mohamed, commander of Iraqi forces in the Qaim area. Each must move carefully to avoid friction with the other.\n\nMeanwhile, IS has turned to insurgent tactics inside Iraq. Last week, it claimed an attack on the home of a tribal leader that killed nine members of the security forces in Anbar, the province that includes Qaim. There has been an uptick in bombings and kidnappings elsewhere in the country, though not all are claimed by IS.\n\nA reminder of the group's presence came last week when the U.S. military announced that American and Iraqi forces killed more than 50 militants in October in the Makhmour Mountains of north-central Iraq.\n\n\"The security situation is under control,\" Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi told a televised press conference. \"It's natural that Daesh is trying to recover its strength,\" he said, using an Arabic acronym for the group. \"Our forces monitor them, repel them and are in control of all the crossings.\"\n\nIn Qaim, the border crossing is sealed by a concrete wall with a metal gate. Militiamen cross into Syria using a gap in the earth berm south of the town.\n\nThe town was once a thriving stopover on the highway between Damascus and Baghdad. Long before a hard border materialized in the latter half of the 20th century, tribes sent their grooms and brides across the frontier to marry, extending the branches of their families on both sides.\n\nWhen IS overran the town in 2014, it linked the group's holdings in both countries and connected them to key highways leading to multiple parts of Iraq.\n\nMany of Qaim's 120,000 residents fled IS. A third of them still have not returned.\n\nSecurity forces issue passes to allow residents to move in and out, a measure against infiltrators. But to apply for an ID, residents must be vetted by both the army and the militias, raising uncomfortable questions about who is in control.\n\nAmong Iraq's Sunnis, the Shiite militias are widely resented, and relations between the two communities have been poisoned ever since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.\n\nQaim resident Talal Obeid said he had been hesitant about returning home because of reports of militia abuses.\n\n\"We are more scared of the yellow flags than the black ones,\" he said, referring to the yellow banners of the Kataeb Hezbollah militia and the black flags of IS.\n\n\"I worry if they stay, there will be friction and provocations.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIssa reported from Baghdad."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Taliban deny involvement in Kabul bombing that killed 50", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The Taliban mainly target security forces and government officials, while IS specializes in sectarian attacks on civilians.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said late Tuesday his group condemns any attack on civilians or religious clerics.\n\nThe suicide bomber was able to sneak into a wedding hall where hundreds of Muslim religious scholars and clerics had gathered to mark the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed a suicide bombing in June that killed at least seven people and wounded 20 at a meeting of top clerics in the capital. The body of religious leaders, known as the Afghan Ulema Council, had issued a decree against suicide attacks and called for peace talks. IS said it had targeted \"tyrant clerics\" who were siding with the U.S.-backed government.\n\nThe Taliban denied involvement in the June attack but they also denounced the gathering.\n\nAfghan security forces have struggled to combat the twin insurgencies since the U.S. and NATO formally ended their combat mission in 2014, shifting to a support and counterterrorism role.

A Chinese flag flutters above the settlement, and a billboard at the entrance says, \"Welcome to the Hotan Unity New Village.\"\n\nThis is a Communist Party showcase for its efforts to tame the Xinjiang region, the heartland of China's often restive Uighur Muslim minority and an unforgiving terrain. The free or low-cost houses are assigned alternately to Uighurs and Han Chinese, who work side-by-side in greenhouses and send their children to school together. It is the future the party envisions for Xinjiang after a massive security crackdown that has sent by some estimates more than a million Muslims to internment camps, and many of their children to orphanages.\n\nBut a closer look at what the party calls \"ethnic unity\" reveals what isn't there: mosques for Muslim worshippers, or traditional Uighur brick homes, often adorned with pointed arches and carved decorations. In their place are colorful murals of what authorities consider to be scenes of unity, such as a Uighur man and his family holding a Chinese flag.\n\nIn the village's new public square, Uighur children banter with Han Chinese children in fluent Mandarin, the language of the Han majority, rather than in their native tongue. Young Uighur women wear Western clothing without the headscarves that are part of traditional Muslim dress.\n\nWhile these are voluntary settlements with economic benefits, experts and Uighur activists believe they are part of an aggressive government campaign to erode the identities of the Central Asian groups who called the region home long before waves of Han migrants arrived in recent decades.\n\n\"'Ethnic unity' is a euphemism for taming, breaking the Uighur people,\" says Joanne Smith Finley, an expert in Uighur identity at Newcastle University in the U.K. \"This is putting flowery bright wallpaper over a damp wall, a rotting wall.\"\n\nConstruction of the village began in 2014 with a planned investment of 1.7 billion yuan ($247 million). The goal was to build 5,000 homes and 10,000 greenhouses, according to local reports, to turn a large swath of desert into farmland and create a shared prosperity among Uighurs and Han Chinese.\n\nAround the same time, the Communist Party came forth with a new strategy focused on ethnic mingling. Subsequently, at least one county offered financial incentives for Uighur-Han intermarriages, while others have launched programs encouraging Uighur families to move into Han Chinese residential areas.\n\nChina is building several such mixed settlements in Xinjiang. A similar village is under construction as a tourist attraction near Kuqa, around 600 kilometers (372 miles) from Hotan. A concrete yurt known as the \"solidarity farmhouse\" already has been completed, and a giant sculpture of a pomegranate is prominently placed at the center of the village to symbolize unity.\n\nIn Hotan, there are signs that the government's experiment is making inroads. Uighur farmers toil alongside Han Chinese to farm crops in what was once barren desert land, and both groups live in modern houses equipped with gas, electricity and water. A billboard displays a picture of President Xi Jinping and a group of Uighur elders joining hands and, according to the caption, \"linking hearts.\"\n\nYet there are also signs of enduring mistrust. As elsewhere in Xinjiang, high walls around homes are topped with barbed wire, and police officers stand guard from behind fences at the entrance of the village. Adults don't mix socially \u2014 at night, a group of Han Chinese dance in the square while the Uighur residents chat among themselves on the sidelines.\n\nA Uighur farmer who moved to the village last September says authorities provided him with free housing and utilities, two greenhouses, a small orchard with grapevines and a barn with sheep, chickens, and pigeons. But the crackdown on Muslims in Xinjiang has made it risky for ordinary Muslims to discuss their religious practices, and when speaking to reporters in front of government observers, he insists he was never a Muslim. Another Uighur farmer in his early seventies, Muzitohtahon, says he is no longer a Muslim.\n\nUighur and Han villagers do seem united by at least one factor \u2014 their desire to escape poverty. Rural areas in Xinjiang, including Hotan, rank among the poorest in China, with many families lacking even the most basic utilities and food. The financial incentives are also a key draw for Han Chinese from other impoverished regions of China.\n\nLast May, 58-year-old Xiao Erying, who is Han Chinese, moved to this village from her hometown in the southern province of Hunan, over 4,000 kilometers away. \"It is better than our hometown,\" she says, as she rakes sheep, chicken and cow manure inside her greenhouse.\n\nFor 60,000 yuan ($8,700), her family bought a two-bedroom home with a small orchard and two greenhouses. The two grandchildren she lives with are given free tuition, school lunches, and even a free set of clothes. Xiao admits she doesn't speak Uighur and cannot communicate with her Uighur neighbors, but she says the layout encourages interaction.\n\nIn a greenhouse a few dozen meters away, Uighur Abudu Mijiti has just begun planting chili with his wife. He moved to the village three years ago to make a more stable living. Two of his three children go to the local school and are fluent in Chinese, he says, as a government minder looks on.\n\n\"For us, it's good, it helps learning our national language,\" he says. \"And because our next-door neighbor is Chinese, as we go in and out, it helps improve ethnic unity.\"\n\nOn the surface, the picture presented at the Hotan Unity New Village reflects the government's vision of an \"idealized place,\" says David O'Brien, an expert at the University of Nottingham.\n\n\"Every single part of it is the official narrative,\" O'Brien says. \"The narrative is, water will flow to the desert. The narrative is, if you come here great opportunity awaits you. The narrative that people will be secular, they will learn Mandarin.\"\n\nYet the settlement remains only partly inhabited. The city says there are 534 households in the compound, but most of the houses are empty. A drive through reveals rows of empty greenhouses and house after house with a sign that says \"sealed off\" patched onto padlocked or chained gates.\n\nUnder the sweltering desert sun, one Han Chinese farmer tending to her plot of Chinese chives complains that water is scarce and her previous batch of chives had to be thrown out. Even when the crops work out, the chives sell for less than one yuan (14 cents) per kilogram.\n\n\"Not even enough for food,\" she grumbles. \"You cannot feed yourself just working on greenhouses.\"\n\nIn the absence of government minders, the woman goes on.\n\n\"Ordinary people are not able to eat meat. The officials can, but not the ordinary people,\" says the woman, who declines to give her name out of fear of retaliation.\n\nAs dusk approaches and temperatures fall, residents slowly make their way out onto the streets to enjoy the evening breeze. On the Uighur side of the street, a young Uighur woman rests on an electric bike after a day's work, looking at her cell phone.\n\nAsked what she thinks of unity, she looks up.\n\n\"Unity?\" she asks. Silently and slowly, she shakes her head, and returns to her phone.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Xinjiang is a region not a province."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Kenya police: Italian national kidnapped by gunmen", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

She told me to help myself and I ran for the man at the door with a club and pushed him away and escaped.\" He said two of the gunmen who were outside the room shot at onlookers.\n\nNgala said the gunmen took Romano across the Galana River. He said the gunmen looked and spoke like members of a local herding community known as Orma. Many herding communities in Kenya that live near the border areas are armed to protect themselves against rivals, who may come across the border to steal their livestock.\n\nIn one of her latest postings on Twitter, Romano said she was grateful to the kids she was working with for showing her how to live without material things.\n\n\"These children, these people have taught me to live with no material things but with love, Joy, gratitude, smiles, sincere eyes ... and be happy in such simple way.

Add Jamal Khashoggi as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Jamal Khashoggi news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., sent a letter to the White House Tuesday evening to officially trigger an investigation into whether the young crown prince ordered the plot.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown between Capitol Hill and the White House as members of both parties in Congress call on Trump to be tougher on Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"It is a delicate situation when we have a longtime ally that we've had for decades, but we have a crown prince that I believe ordered the killing of a journalist,\" Corker told ABC Chattanooga, Tennessee, affiliate WTVC.\n\nJabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump released a winding statement that called Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month a \"terrible\" crime, but it focused its ire on the Saudis' regional rival Iran and defended U.S. relations with the kingdom, a \"steadfast partner\" and \"great ally.\"\n\n\"The language that was used it was as if they were writing a press release for the Saudi Arabians, not for the United States,\" Corker told WTVC.\n\nThe focus on the role of Prince Mohammed, also known by his initials \"MBS,\" has emerged as the central question after the Saudis initially denied Khashoggi was killed, then denied responsibility, then blamed an accidental fistfight, before calling it a rogue operation and punishing the team that carried it out.\n\nMembers of Congress have consistently said that the crown prince, who has consolidated power behind the scenes with his aging father King Salman on the throne, must have been involved, especially because of the structure of the Saudi government. The CIA has reportedly reached the same assessment, although Trump denied that at the White House Tuesday.\n\n\"The CIA has looked at it, they've studied it a lot. They have nothing definitive. And the fact is maybe he did, maybe he didn't,\" Trump told reporters, adding, \"We're staying with Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nSome Democrats have called for a fundamental shift in U.S. relations with the Saudis, but the country is still mostly seen as an important U.S. partner on counter terrorism, combating Iranian influence, and stabilizing energy markets.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nStill, Corker and Menendez's letter requests the administration conduct an investigation of MBS's role under the Global Magnitsky Act, a 2016 law the authorizes U.S. sanctions for human rights abuses or corruption. The law grants Congress the authority to order the administration to investigate an individual and make a determination within 120 days, although it doesn't obligate the administration to then sanction the person.\n\n\"In light of recent developments, including the Saudi government's acknowledgement that Saudi officials killed Mr. Khashoggi in its Istanbul consulate, we request that your determination specifically address whether Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman is responsible for Mr. Khashoggi's murder,\" the senators wrote.\n\nCorker and Menendez sent a similar letter on Oct. 10, a little over a week after Khashoggi disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate, demanding a Global Magnitsky investigation into what happened. The result of that investigation was the administration's sanctions on 17 Saudi officials last Thursday.\n\nBut critics pointed out all 17 of those individuals had already been arrested by the Saudis, with 11 of them indicted the same day and five of whom the Saudis are seeking to execute. The U.S. sanctions did little to contrast the Saudi narrative that this team acted alone, although the administration continues to say it will conduct its own investigation to hold everyone responsible accountable.\n\nHasan Jamali, File/AP Photo\n\nCongress seems to have little faith in that, again pressuring the administration by triggering an investigation that could result in sanctions -- something that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Tuesday there is \"strong bipartisan support ... including [against] appropriate members of the royal family.\"\n\nOne possible disruption in those plans, however, is that Corker, at times a vocal critic of Trump, is retiring and will leave his Senate seat in January. The expected incoming chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen.

The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign, also known as BDS, has claimed a number of successes in recent years, leading Israel to identify it as a major threat.\n\nIsraeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin called on Airbnb to reverse what he called a \"discriminatory decision\" and \"disgraceful surrender\" to the boycott movement, vowing that Israel would retaliate.\n\n\"If you have a policy of discrimination against Israelis you cannot earn money in Israel,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nHe also said the government would encourage hosts in West Bank settlements to sue the company to make it \"pay\" for its decision. Levin added that Israel would impose other restrictions on Airbnb's operations in the country, without elaborating.\n\nAirbnb announced on Monday that it would delist some 200 properties in the coming days and cease its operations in Israeli settlements \"that are at the core of the dispute between the Israelis and Palestinians.\" The company declined to comment on the Israeli threats.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Today over 400,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank, in addition to some 200,000 Israelis in east Jerusalem.\n\nMost of the international community considers settlements illegal and an impediment to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Israel sees the territory as disputed and says the fate of the settlements must be resolved in peace negotiations with the Palestinians.\n\nThe boycott movement, which calls for sanctions against settlement products and companies doing business in the West Bank, has made inroads in recent years, helping to tarnish Israel's international image and prompting it to take retaliatory measures.\n\nIsrael has enacted a law banning any foreigner who \"knowingly issues a public call for boycotting Israel\" from entering the country. It has identified activist groups from around the world whose members can be denied entry upon arrival.\n\nBDS supporters say that in urging businesses, artists and universities to sever ties with Israel, they are using nonviolent means to resist unjust policies toward Palestinians. Israel says the movement masks its motives to delegitimize or destroy the Jewish state.\n\nThe Palestinian-led movement claims responsibility for pressuring some large companies to stop or alter operations in Israel or the West Bank, including carbonated drink maker SodaStream, French construction company Veolia and international mobile phone giant Orange.\n\nAirbnb's decision coincided with the publication of a Human Rights Watch report Tuesday investigating tourist rental listings in settlements by Airbnb and Booking.com.\n\nEntitled \"Bed-and-Breakfast on Stolen Land,\" the report says that Israeli settlements' discrimination against Palestinians uniquely violates humanitarian law and Airbnb's nondiscrimination policy. Most Palestinians must obtain a permit to enter the settlements or Israel proper and typically do so as laborers.\n\nOmar Shakir, Human Rights Watch's Israel-Palestine director, said that with its threatened sanctions, Israel was prioritizing its support for settlements over a thriving tourism industry in Israel proper that relies on services like Airbnb. If applied, the sanctions could affect lodging costs for thousands of tourists expected to arrive in Tel Aviv next year for the Eurovision song contest.\n\nShakir said the government's response \"reflects the degree to which the government is willing to go, putting the whole country's interests at stake over its illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch, along with Palestinian officials and other rights groups, have for years pressured Airbnb to pull out of Israeli-occupied territory.\n\nSenior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat called Airbnb's decision an \"initial positive step,\" and urged the company to extend its decision to Israeli listings in east Jerusalem. The BDS movement echoed that sentiment in a statement on its website.\n\nFor settler hosts, who see their homes as an integral part of Israel, the decision triggered outrage and confusion.\n\nTsofiya Jacob has rented out her apartment in the Kfar Adumim settlement using Airbnb for the past year and a half to a regular rotation of European and American tourists. She advertises her rental on Airbnb as an \"escape from daily tumult\" in Israel, and doesn't mention that the property, complete with a Jacuzzi and desert views, is located in the West Bank.\n\n\"I see this (community) as part of home, part of Israel,\" Jacob said. \"I understand the sensitivities but despite that, in my opinion, we are here.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "US bombers fly over S.

That will mark the first time they've sat down together since the start of a bitter trade war and amid tensions over the South China Sea.\n\nChina has demanded the U.S. cease military activity of all kind near its South China Sea island claims that it has been rapidly fortifying. The U.S. says it takes no stance on sovereignty claims, but will continue to sail and operate wherever international law permits.\n\nIn late September, a Chinese destroyer came close to the USS Decatur in the South China Sea in what the U.S. Navy called an \"unsafe and unprofessional maneuver.\"\n\nAsked to comment Wednesday on the incident, Rear Adm. Karl O. Thomas, commander of Carrier Strike Group 5, said the \"vast majority of our interactions out there at sea are very professional.\"\n\n\"That was a rare, unusual occurrence,\" Thomas told reporters at a ship-board news conference. \"In that particular case, the ship made some aggressive, continuing aggressive maneuvers and our ship warned them and had to maneuver to prevent a collision. It was unfortunate and I'd like to see that not happen again.\"\n\nThe Navy said in a statement that during the Reagan's visit, interactions will take place with Hong Kong citizens through sports, community relations projects and tours of the carrier. More than 4,400 men and women are usually aboard the ship.\n\nThe Reagan's visit comes two months after China rejected a similar request by another U.S. Navy ship amid a spike in tensions between the countries' militaries.\n\nAnd while the port call is seen as a positive for bilateral relations, other events this week point to the ongoing rivalry between the sides.\n\nU.S. Pacific Air Forces said two B-52 bombers flew over the South China Sea on Monday, calling it a \"routine training mission.\"\n\nThe B-52H Stratofortress bombers departed Andersen Air Force Base in Guam as part of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's Continuous Bomber Presence operations that began in 2004, Pacific Air Forces said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"This recent mission is consistent with international law and United States' long-standing commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" the statement said.\n\nAlso this week, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, reported that China had installed a new platform on Bombay Reef, a remote undeveloped feature in the Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. Vietnam and Taiwan also claim the reef.\n\nThe platform appears to be topped with a radome and solar panels, and its strategic location makes it likely it is intended to extend China's radar or signals intelligence collection in the area, the report said. Bombay Reef already has a lighthouse to serve as an aid to navigation.\n\nUnlike China's large man-made islands created by piling sand on top of coral reefs, installing the modestly sized Bombay Reef platform did not require inflicting major environmental damage, CSIS said. However, that illustrates how easily China could expand its footprint to other features such as Scarborough Shoal, which it seized from the Philippines in 2012, it added.\n\nCompared to dredging and reclamation, the installation of a modest platform would be \"harder to prevent at the time and more difficult to rally international condemnation against after the fact,\" the report said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Wednesday at a daily news briefing in Beijing that he had no information about the details of the report, while reasserting China's claims to the island group it calls Xisha.\n\n\"The Paracel Islands are China's territory.

They were arrested Monday on suspicion of collaborating in the wrongdoing.\n\nTheir detention was extended Wednesday for another 10 days, Kyodo News service reported. It cited the Tokyo District Court, which must grant approval for such detentions. The court and prosecutors declined to comment.\n\nUnder Japanese law, suspects can be held for 20 days per possible charge without an official indictment. Additional charges can be tagged on, resulting in longer detentions. Neither Ghosn nor Kelly has been charged so far.\n\nGhosn is suspected of under-reporting $44.6 million in income from 2011 to 2015, according to Tokyo prosecutors.\n\nThe maximum penalty, upon conviction for violating finance and exchange laws is 10 years in prison, a 10 million yen ($89,000) fine, or both.\n\nDetainees undergoing interrogation in the Tokyo area are generally held in a center that is separate from the prison for those who have been convicted and sentenced. It is supposed to be nicer than a prison but it is austere with limited access to outside visitors.\n\nProsecutors have not confirmed where he is being held.\n\nWesterners are sometimes given better treatment than Japanese in custody, to account for cultural differences, and so it is unclear what kind of conditions Ghosn might be in.\n\nIn 2015, Julie Hamp, a Toyota Motor Corp. public relations executive, an American, was arrested on suspicion of importing oxycodone, a narcotic pain killer, into Japan. The drug is tightly controlled in Japan. Police said the drugs were in a parcel Hamp mailed to herself.\n\nShe was released from custody after about three weeks of interrogation without charges and she quickly left Japan.\n\nIt is unclear that precedence has any relevance to Ghosn's situation because the allegations involve so much money, span a significant period of time, and involve the assets of a major company.\n\nDespite the arrests, analysts said the impact on Nissan Motor Co.'s auto sales would likely be minimal.\n\n\"I'd be surprised if it impacts car sales very much,\" said Christopher Richter, auto analyst for CLSA Securities Japan Co.\n\n\"Consumers are discerning enough to say: This car, the wheels might fall off so I'm not going to buy it. This car company, the executive might have done something kind of dodgy, but do I like the car or not.\"\n\nRichter noted sales dips that hit after previous Nissan scandals were temporary. The deviations the automaker acknowledged in those scandals were more directly related to product quality, such as mileage, emissions and plant inspections.\n\nRenault SA of France, a partner since the late 1990s and now holding a 43 percent stake in Nissan, retained Ghosn as chief executive in an emergency board meeting Tuesday, while naming the company's chief operating officer, Thierry Bollore, in his place.\n\nRenault's board also is requesting that Nissan share details of its internal investigation into Ghosn, which the company says was sparked by a whistleblower.\n\nFrom the start, Nissan has sought to distance itself from the arrests.\n\nChief Executive Hiroto Saikawa denounced Ghosn and Kelly as \"the masterminds,\" and made clear he thought they should be removed at Thursday's board meeting.\n\nGhosn, 64, is credited with turning around Nissan from near-bankruptcy after he was sent to Nissan by Renault in 1999. He served as Nissan's chief executive from 2001 until last year. He became chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two major automakers simultaneously.\n\nIn 2016, he became chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. after Nissan took it into the alliance. Ghosn spearheaded Nissan's lead in the industry in electric cars, with the Nissan Leaf the best-selling electric car. He was also aggressive in pushing for so-called self-driving technology.\n\nKelly, 62, joined Nissan in the U.S. in 1988, and became a board member from 2012. His background over the years has been in human resources and alliance management. He has a law degree from Loyola University School of Law and a bachelor's degree in public administration from Augustana College.\n\nWhen Saikawa was asked how such actions could have gone undetected for five years, perhaps longer, he blamed a murky system of checks and balances at Nissan and emphasized that he believed Ghosn had too much power.\n\nNissan's overall performance won't be hurt by the absence of Ghosn, \"as long as the executive team pulls together,\" said Janet Lewis, an analyst at Macquarie Research.\n\nThe fact the case was initially raised by a whistleblower shows the system was working, she said.\n\nNissan shares tanked Tuesday after the scandal surfaced, falling 5.5 percent. The stock recovered moderately in Wednesday's trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, closing up 0.4 percent.\n\nMasahiro Akita, auto analyst with Credit Suisse, said he was stunned by the news of Ghosn's arrest.\n\nBut he believes operations at Nissan will mainly remain business as usual, while uncertainties about brand image remain.\n\n\"It's not realistic to think the alliance will suddenly change as it is now already operating,\" he said, noting the automakers share platforms, or the basic parts on which vehicles are built, as well as parts purchasing.\n\n\"You can't go back on it that easily.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Morgan Winsor", "title": "Relentless California wildfires leave 84 dead, nearly 700 unaccounted for", "description": "Nearly 700 people are unaccounted for in California as deadly wildfires continue to burn at both ends of the state.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/relentless-california-wildfires-leave-84-dead-800-unaccounted/story?id=59262994", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/california-northern-fire8-ap-ml-181117_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:29:40Z", "content": "Hundreds of people remain missing in the wake of a pair of ferocious wildfires that have been blazing across both ends of California.

Neither Ghosn nor Greg Kelly, another senior Nissan executive who was arrested, has been charged so far.\n\nGhosn is suspected of under-reporting $44.6 million in income from 2011 to 2015, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe maximum penalty, upon conviction for violating finance and exchange laws is 10 years in prison, a 10 million yen ($89,000) fine, or both.\n\nDetainees undergoing interrogation in the Tokyo area are generally held in a center that is separate from the prison for those who have been convicted and sentenced. It is supposed to be nicer than a prison but it is austere with limited access to outside visitors.\n\nProsecutors have not confirmed where Ghosn is being held.\n\nWesterners are sometimes given better treatment than Japanese in custody, to account for cultural differences, and so it is unclear what kind of conditions Ghosn might be in.\n\nIn 2015, Julie Hamp, a Toyota Motor Corp. public relations executive, an American, was arrested on suspicion of importing oxycodone, a narcotic pain killer, into Japan. The drug is tightly controlled in Japan. Police said the drugs were in a parcel Hamp mailed to herself.\n\nShe was released from custody after about three weeks of interrogation without charges and she quickly left Japan.\n\nIt is unclear that precedence has any relevance to Ghosn's situation because the allegations involve so much money, span a significant period of time, and involve the assets of a major company.\n\nMeanwhile, Renault has decided to retain Ghosn as CEO and that the chief operating officer, Thierry Bollore, would fill in on a temporary basis.\n\nRenault's board also requested that Nissan share details of its internal investigation into Ghosn, which the company says was sparked by a whistleblower.\n\nFrom the start, Nissan has sought to distance itself from the arrests.\n\nSaikawa denounced Ghosn and Kelly as \"the masterminds,\" and made clear he thought they should be removed at Nissan's board meeting Thursday.\n\nGhosn, 64, is credited with turning around Nissan from near-bankruptcy after he was sent to Nissan by Renault in 1999. He served as Nissan's chief executive from 2001 until last year. He became chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two major automakers simultaneously.\n\nIn 2016, he became chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. after Nissan took it into the alliance. Ghosn spearheaded Nissan's lead in the industry in electric cars, with the Nissan Leaf the best-selling electric car.\n\nKelly, 62, joined Nissan in the U.S. in 1988, and became a board member from 2012. His background over the years has been in human resources and alliance management. He has a law degree from Loyola University School of Law and a bachelor's degree in public administration from Augustana College.\n\nWhen Saikawa was asked how such actions could have gone undetected for five years, perhaps longer, he blamed a murky system of checks and balances at Nissan and emphasized that he believed Ghosn had too much power.\n\nDespite the arrests, analysts said the impact on Nissan Motor Co.'s auto sales would likely be minimal.\n\n\"I'd be surprised if it impacts car sales very much,\" said Christopher Richter, auto analyst for CLSA Securities Japan Co. \"Consumers are discerning enough.\"\n\nRichter noted sales dips after previous Nissan scandals were temporary. The deviations the automaker acknowledged in those scandals were more directly related to product quality, such as mileage, emissions and plant inspections.\n\nNissan shares tanked 5.5 percent Tuesday after the scandal surfaced and edged up 0.4 percent on Wednesday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Heavy holiday traffic in Los Angeles", "description": "Aerial footage captures bumper-to-bumper traffic in Los Angeles as Americans get a head start on Thanksgiving travel.

Many in South Korea believed the Seoul government settled for far too less in the sex slave deal and that Japan still hasn't acknowledged legal responsibility for atrocities during its colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono sharply criticized South Korea's decision to shut down the foundation, saying that Seoul would violate the \"most basic rule to live in the international society\" by walking back on the deal. Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Takeo Akiba summoned South Korean Ambassador to Japan Lee Su-hoon to the ministry to lodge a protest.\n\n\"The announcement is problematic and unacceptable,\" said Kono, urging Seoul to stick with the agreement signed under its previous government. South Korea's Foreign Ministry couldn't immediately confirm Kono's comments that Ambassador Lee told Japanese officials Seoul doesn't plan to scrap or renegotiate the agreement.\n\nSeoul's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said it will take legal steps to dissolve the foundation, a process ministry officials said could take months. Lee Nam-hoon, an official from the gender equality ministry, said Seoul's Foreign Ministry plans to consult with Tokyo on what to do with the 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) Japan funded to the foundation that was formally launched in July 2016.\n\n\"After considering diverse opinions over the 'Reconciliation and Healing Foundation' based on victim-centric principles, we have decided to push for the dissolution of the foundation,\" Gender Equality Minister Jin Sun Mee said in a statement. She said the ministry will continue to push policies to \"restore the honor and dignity\" of the sexual slavery victims.\n\nThe decision was welcomed by hundreds of protesters gathered in Seoul for a weekly rally denouncing sexual slavery by Japan's wartime military. Organizers played a recorded message by a hospitalized 92-year-old victim, Kim Bok-dong, who said she was happy that the foundation was getting dissolved but also demanded a proper apology and compensation from Tokyo.\n\n\"We won, (but) it's just the start,\" said Yoon Meehyang, who heads an activist group representing South Korean sexual slavery victims. \"In saying that we won, we mean that we turned back history to the day before Dec. 28, 2015. We will invest all our passion to write a new history of justice while the victims still have time and overcome past three years that were lost.\"\n\nHistorians say tens of thousands of women from around Asia, many of them Korean, were sent to front-line military brothels to provide sex to Japanese soldiers.\n\nLiberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has been a harsh critic of the 2015 deal reached under his conservative predecessor, told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a meeting in September that the foundation was failing to function properly because of strong opposition by the victims and public. A South Korean government panel in December last year concluded the deal as seriously flawed because Seoul's previous conservative government failed to properly communicate with the victims before reaching the deal.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan are already at odds over a ruling by Seoul's Supreme Court last month that a major Japanese steelmaker should compensate four South Koreans for forced labor during Japan's colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II. Abe said Tokyo will respond \"resolutely\" to the ruling, which he described as a violation of a 1965 treaty between Seoul and Tokyo that restored diplomatic ties and was accompanied by more than $800 million in economic aid and loans from Tokyo to Seoul.\n\nSeoul and Tokyo's bitter disputes over history have complicated Washington's efforts to strengthen trilateral cooperation to deal with North Korea's nuclear threat and China's growing influence in the region.\n\nAt the time of the sex slave deal, Seoul said there were 46 surviving South Korean victims. But 19 of them since died. Twelve victims who rejected payment from the foundation sued the Seoul government over the deal in August 2016, saying it didn't go far enough to establish Japan's responsibility.\n\nLee, the ministry official, said the foundation had used 4.4 billion won ($3.8 million) in cash payments to 34 victims who were alive at the time of the 2015 deal and to relatives of 58 victims who were dead by then. Only 27 of around 240 South Korean women who registered with the government as victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery are currently alive, Lee said.\n\nUnder the 2015 agreement, which was then described by both governments as \"irreversible,\" Japan pledged to fund the foundation to help support the victims. However, Japan said it didn't consider the 1 billion yen it provided to the fund as compensation, saying such issues were settled in a 1965 treaty. South Korea, in exchange, vowed to refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue and will try to resolve a Japanese grievance over a statue of a girl representing victims of sexual slavery that sits in front of the Japanese Embassy in downtown Seoul."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Bangladesh frees photographer facing charges of propaganda", "description": "Photographer released from jail 3 months after being arrested on charges of spreading false information about a street protest and propaganda against Bangladesh government", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bangladesh-frees-photographer-facing-charges-propaganda-59331544", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T02:01:43Z", "content": "An acclaimed photographer has been released from a jail in Bangladesh more than three months after he was arrested on charges of spreading false information about a street protest and propaganda against the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Hyde-Smith, however, did vaguely refer to the \"public hanging\" comment and apologized at a debate with her opponent Espy on Tuesday.\n\n\"For anyone that was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize,\" she said. \"There was no ill will, no intent, whatsoever in my statements.\"\n\nFour days after the first video surfaced, another video from Nov. 3 was tweeted in which Hyde-Smith tells a group of supporters in Starkville, Mississippi, that it would be a \u201cgreat idea\u201d to make voting \u201cjust a little more difficult\u201d for \u201cliberal folks.\u201d\n\nCindy Hyde-Smith on voter suppression: \"And then they remind me, that there's a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who that maybe we don't want to vote.

They are unheard of in most other areas, including where the school is located in the southern Guangxi region, a popular tourist destination known for spectacular scenery, not violence or terrorism.\n\nThat's why the planned checks worry some.\n\n\"Xinjiang has emerged as China's surveillance laboratory,\" said James Leibold, a scholar of Chinese ethnic politics and national identity at La Trobe University in Australia. \"It is unsurprising that some of the methods first pioneered in China's west are now being rolled out in other regions.\"\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, the government has in recent years tried to tighten controls over what the public sees and says online and stepped up political oversight of universities. Sometimes, these measures have run into a new generation of Chinese accustomed to greater freedoms, sparking public outcry and occasionally government retreat.\n\nThe leaked notice in Guilin warned that hostile domestic groups and foreign powers are \"wantonly spreading illicit and illegal videos\" through the internet. It said the search for violent, terrorist, reactionary and obscene content, which was to be conducted this month, was necessary to resist and combat extremist recordings that it called mentally harmful.\n\nThe order triggered a public uproar last week.\n\nPosts on China's Weibo microblogging site with hashtags on schools checking electronic devices were viewed nearly 80 million times. Users voiced privacy concerns, comparing the measure to computer chips inserted in brains and the George Orwell novel \"1984.\"\n\nThen came critical editorials in state-run publications saying the notice could violate Chinese constitutional protection of the right to communicate freely and have those communications remain confidential.\n\n\"If colleges and universities check the phones, computers, and hard disks of teachers and students, they're suspected of infringing on communication freedom and privacy,\" said an editorial in the Beijing Youth Daily. \"Those responsible at the school should be held accountable, as they had a great negative impact on the school's image.\"\n\nAdministrators told another state-owned publication, \"The Paper,\" that the search had not yet been carried out, and that they were considering reducing its scope. University and local education ministry officials referred questions to a media office, which did not answer repeated phone calls.\n\nWeibo, while not a government body, ran into hot water in April when it said it would censor content related to gay issues on its microblog. The company backpedaled under intense criticism, including from state-run publications.\n\nIt's unclear what prompted the Guilin university's planned search. It could have been a trial run to see how the public would react or an overzealous local administrator, said Christopher Colley, a National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates assistant professor who has lectured at Chinese universities.\n\nEither way, he said, the backlash shows that though online censorship is common in China, physical searches of phones and laptops is an extreme measure that many will not accept.\n\n\"Most people in China are willing to tolerate Big Brother as long as it contributes to social stability, but for many, this is going too far,\" Colley said.\n\nSchools in Xinjiang have been conducting similar searches since the region's highest court in early 2014 issued a notice forbidding audio and video recordings promoting terrorism, religious extremism and ethnic division.\n\nTeachers and administrators at Xinjiang Normal University's College of Physics and Electronics searched electronic devices in every dormitory on campus on Nov. 9, 2014. A post about the search on the school's website says, \"Through investigating violent and terroristic videos, religious extremism on campus has been weakened.\"\n\nIn 2017, China University of Petroleum's branch in Karamay, a city in oil country in Xinjiang's north, ordered various school departments to assign inspectors to search the computers of all teachers on campus.\n\nXinjiang is home to a large Uighur population, a Muslim ethnic group that has long harbored simmering resentment against rule from Beijing. A series of riots and attacks blamed on separatist Uighurs has prompted a sweeping crackdown on Muslims in the region.\n\nChina has rolled out one of the world's most aggressive surveillance and policing programs both in Xinjiang and neighboring Tibet.\n\nUighurs are regularly singled out and stopped at checkpoints to have their smartphones scanned for religious content. As The Associated Press reported in May, they risk being detained and sent to internment camps if police find songs or videos they deem suspicious or apps that are commonly used to contact people outside China, such as WhatsApp.\n\n\"Xinjiang today appears to be the leading-edge of a highly intrusive and coercive surveillance society that the (Communist Party) is intent on constructing across China,\" Leibold said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Photos of bruises on back, leg are proof of assault by Avenatti: Actress", "description": "The 24-year-old who filed for a restraining order against Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said the encounter was sparked by an argument over money.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/photos-bruises-back-leg-proof-assault-avenatti-actress-59328722", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/181120_wn_llamas4_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:49:59Z", "content": "Now Playing: Michael Avenatti arrested on domestic abuse charge Now Playing: Milwaukee bus driver lauded for helping homeless passenger Now Playing: Long lines as Massachusetts opens first 2 dispensaries on East Coast Now Playing: Photos of bruises on back, l\u2026 [+1148 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Photos of bruises on back, leg are proof of assault by Avenatti: Actress\n\nThere is new trouble tonight for the attorney who took on the president, Michael avenatti.

During the campaign, the president made Hillary Clinton's use of private e-mail a central issue. I think she's pathetic. I think she should be a jail for what she did with her e-mails. Okay? Reporter: Now we are seeing e-mails Ivanka Trump sent white house aides and government officials, including cabinet secretaries from her personal account, using her married name, ivanka Kushner. In one e-mail, obtained by a liberal group through the freedom of information act, she writes \"For future reference\" and gives her government e-mail. Her lawyer issued a statement saying, \"While transitioning into government, Ms. Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family.\" The president today says there's no comparison between Hillary Clinton's actions and his daughter's. Early on and for a little period of time, ivanka did some e-mails. They weren't classified like Hillary Clinton. They weren't deleted. It's all in the presidential records. Everything is there. Jon Karl live at the white house tonight, as well. The president there defending his daughter and her use of private e-mail, but tonight, Jon, as you know, \"The New York Times\" is breaking a story that president trump once wanted the justice department to prosecute his former opponent, Hillary Clinton, and James Comey, too, but he was advised not to? Reporter: \"The New York Times\" that white house counsel don mcgahn rebuffed the president's request and mcgahn had the white house legal team draft a memo, saying if the president ordered the prosecution of his political opponents, he could face a range of consequences, including impeachment. David, there is no comment from the white house tonight on this story, and don mcgahn's attorney said simply that he would not comment on what legal advice he off ored the president.

We have learned this evening that he has turned in his written answers to Robert Mueller, and it comes as the president also makes headlines on Saudi Arabia. Today, making it clear that he is standing with Saudi Arabia's crown prince, despite the murder of \"Washington post\" writer Jamal khashoggi. And despite the CIA reportedly concluding with, quote, high probability, the crown prince was behind the hit. Here's ABC's senior white house correspondent Cecilia Vega tonight. Reporter: From president trump today, a forceful defense. If we abandoned Saudi Arabia, it would be a terrible mistake. Reporter: That, in spite of \"The Washington post's\" report that the CIA has concluded crown prince Mohammed bin Salman himself ordered the assassination of journalist Jamal khashoggi. Khashoggi last seen alive walking into the Saudi consulate in istanbul. Officials say he was assassinated by a Saudi hit squad. These airport security images published in a Turkish newspaper show the luggage of the alleged killers. Right there, electric shock devices, syringes, scissors, and radios. There was even an audio recording of khashoggi's execution. Apparently, none of it enough to convince the president to break ranks with this Middle Eastern ally. I'm not going to destroy the world economy and I'm not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia. Reporter: Today, in an exclamation point-filled statement, the president emphatically declared, \"The world is a very dangerous place.\" And while he criticized the murder, saying, \"The crime against Jamal khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone,\" he also essentially declared the matter case closed, writing, \"It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event. Maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" On Fox News, the president said the crown prince assured him he was not involved. He told me that -- I would say maybe five times at different points. Reporter: Today, he told me, there's just too much on the line. Why are you siding with the Saudis over your own intelligence community? Because it's America first to me. Saudi Arabia, if we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof. Cecilia Vega asking the questions there at the white house. And Cecilia, the president's lawyers are now confirming that the president has turned in his written answers to Robert Mueller? Reporter: David, they were turned in today. This, after months of negotiations over the scope of these questions, what the subject could be, how many there would be. Sources tell us that the president actually spent several days last week huddled up with his lawyers, coming up with the answers to these questions. Answers, we're told, that address conclusion, but not obstruction. Cecilia Vega at the white house tonight. Cecilia, thank you.
