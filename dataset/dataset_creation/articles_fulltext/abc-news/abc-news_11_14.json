But Filipinos revere the bells as symbols of national pride.\n\nU.S. Army soldiers took the bells after an attack killed 48 American troops in 1901, during the U.S. occupation of the Philippines. Two of the Bells of Balangiga are at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, and the third is with the U.S. Army in South Korea.\n\nPhilippine presidents including current President Rodrigo Duterte, have repeatedly called for the bells' return. Now, President Donald Trump's administration has agreed that bolstering the U.S. relationship with a key international ally outweighs concerns at home, even among Republican political allies.\n\nMattis marked the start of a several-week process to return the bells to a church in the Philippines with a visit to the two bells at F.E. Warren. With him was the Philippine ambassador to the U.S, H.E. Jose Manuel G. Romualdez.\n\n\"History reminds us that all wars end. In returning the Bells of Balangiga to our ally and our friend, the Philippines, we pick up our generation's responsibility to deepen the respect between our peoples,\" Mattis said in a ceremony at the base.\n\nSoldiers from the Philippines fought alongside U.S. troops in World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War and in the recent struggle against international terrorism, Mattis pointed out.\n\n\"To those who fear that we lose something by returning the bells, please hear me when I say that the bells mark time, but courage is timeless,\" Mattis said.\n\nThose opposed to returning the bells include Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican. Mead took part in the ceremony even as he sides with U.S. veterans who worry that returning the bells could lead to the repatriation of any number of items serving as memorials to American war dead.\n\n\"We know you and the president have looked at this, and the highest priority of the military of course is national security,\" Mead told Mattis at the gathering of a couple hundred Air Force officers, personnel and family members. \"We absolutely need to build those friendships.\"\n\nWyoming's all-Republican congressional delegation also opposes the bells' return, saying in a joint statement released by Sen. Mike Enzi spokesman Max D'Onofrio that repatriation would set a dangerous precedent for other veterans' memorials in the U.S.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Mead Gruver at https://twitter.com/meadgruver"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Woman had 44 frozen dogs, 130 live dogs in home", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Older versions of the compound are turning up in dangerous levels in drinking water supplies around the country.\n\nDrinking water contamination has been the main concern cited by public health officials and regulators in connection with the compounds, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalyl substances, or PFAS.\n\nThe EPA findings said animal studies show the so-called GenX nonstick compound has the potential of affecting the kidneys, blood, immune system, liver and developing fetuses following oral exposure. \"The data are suggestive of cancer,\" the draft report said.\n\n\"Toxicity is only one piece of information that public officials consider when determining whether there is a risk to public health,\" the report said. \"Other factors, such as exposure, must also be considered.\"\n\nLee Ferguson, an environmental analytical chemist and associate professor at Duke University, said those findings would mean \"the compounds that we're replacing toxic compounds for are also toxic.\"\n\nConcern over GenX, used in Teflon and other materials, has been strongest in North Carolina. Authorities have found it in water supplies serving hundreds of thousands of people downstream of a Chemours Co. plant that makes it outside Fayetteville.\n\nWednesday's draft findings suggest chronic exposure to GenX is dangerous at levels as low as a few hundred parts per trillion, Ferguson said. Two older versions from the same family of compounds \u2014 taken out of manufacturing in the United States \u2014 have been found to be dangerous at less than a hundred parts per trillion.\n\nPFAS are used in nonstick coatings on things ranging from pans to fast-food wrappers, as well as firefighting foam. Federal toxicology officials determined recently that the two phased-out versions of the compound are dangerous at levels far lower than previously known. An unidentified White House official in an email released through open-records laws called that finding a \"potential public relations nightmare\" earlier this year.\n\nChemours media representatives didn't immediately respond to a phone call and email seeking comment on the EPA report.\n\nU.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican whose district stretches into the Fayetteville area, said he looks forward to the completion of a pending EPA management plan that the agency says will help guide state and local governments.\n\n\"I encourage swift action to help the state better understand what we need to do going forward to keep our water clean and keep our citizens safe,\" he said in a news release.\n\nIn one of the North Carolina areas dealing with GenX contamination, New Hanover County public health director Phillip Tarte said he was reviewing the report, calling it an important step.\n\nThere are no federal health standards for GenX. The EPA classifies it as an \"emerging contaminant\" needing research.\n\nThe chemical is related to other fluorinated chemicals including PFOA, which has been blamed for causing health problems. In February 2017, Chemours and DuPont \u2014 which spun off Chemours two years ago \u2014 agreed to pay nearly $671 million to settle thousands of lawsuits related to the release of PFOA from a Parkersburg, West Virginia, plant more than a decade ago.\n\nThe EPA held a series of hearings on the contaminants earlier in the year. State and local officials and others used the hearings to urge the agency to take the lead in regulating the compounds.\n\nActing EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement Wednesday that the \"EPA is delivering on its commitment to provide our state and local partners the tools and information they need to address PFAS.\"\n\nThe EPA will now seek 60 days of public comment on its findings.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDrew contributed from Raleigh, North Carolina."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Canada Goose, Tahoe rise; Macy's, Blue Apron fall", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Signs of unity emerging from the hill as well that will be kind of fun later on but to kick us off today wanna dig into this unfolding. Extraordinary deployment of US active duty troops along the southern US border with Mexico something we haven't seen in recent memory. Quinn was just back from there. And we'll talk about that warrant a second but the Defense Secretary gen Mattis making a visit today to those troops 5600. American active duty troops down in the borders the pictures just coming in here to ABC news. Of the Defense Secretary green. Did the troops there who I have as you can see. I have a full fledged operation laundry. Machines they've they've got trucked in some gas units they've got tent cities going up there to house those troops. Many of them likely to be on the southern border through the Thanksgiving holiday. Secretary of defense Jim Mattis address reporters and said it's a moral obligation that they have Nicholas. Border security as part of national security. Our units are in position to enable. The Border Patrol to law enforcement operation. We determined the mission went absolutely legal and it has also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers. It obviously a moral and ethical vision to support our border patrolman. So moral ethical Mitt mission Quinn you're just back from camp Donna. Where secretary Madison's today what's happening on the ground there where you see. We'll extraordinary deployment I think he's an advance DeVon is really the best way to describe this troops I talk to their couldn't really. Dried direct comparison for summing like this. We heard it being described as similar to when the army response to a natural disaster in terms of them providing just logistics to support CBP. But at this far as the base camp goes. That is a sprawling tent town that was popped up there by the military. Like you mentioned they've got laundry service says they've got tense they have got medical services just like the ones you see in Afghanistan right down there I mean. Some of this video you shot and are bringing to us as our viewers are seeing here. What did you see them actually doing there's been a lot of debate about the utility of having these troops on the border. What what's their job so the the biggest mission is is to support CBP is so that's. Laying down con concertina wire that barbed wire that he's he has at border checkpoints or they're shoring up. The ports of entry themselves. He said we are shown some video earlier that he doll go border crossing at the small border town that they've. Beefed up an extra barbed wire are also adding more bear years to pleases in between those ports of entry. And they're prepping all that stuff at the camp that mess was visiting. It and you. I had an opportunity to talk to meet with some of the Border Patrol agents who are in theory benefiting from this. Massive show of back up if you will from the military do they feel like this is. This is helpful to the hammers it sort of too many cooks in the kitchen with you all on the border. I will say the bill take all the support they can get because they're gearing an extremely difficult job down there there at Mehmet that these ports of entry there amass capacity with the people they already have coming. So it's not so much a reinforcement problem it's more of a just processing problem for them they get backed up on a daily basis with people claiming asylum just the regular flow. And and that's where really they candies that now. It's great to have your reporting their let's bring in our Elizabeth McLaughlin over at the Pentagon she is tracking. The impetus for this deployment president trump pointing to that caravan of migrants moving after Central America. Wind understand several hundred have already arrived at the border a few more thousand on the way but. Elizabeth perhaps the latest on what we know about where they are annual what what we do what we know what these so called invasion that the president. Height to head of. While seven your right I mean the secretary Mattis was asked about this as he was heading down to a border what is the threat. And he pointed to the caravans that are coming. There were about 350 migrants that arrived in Tijuana and that's right across the border from C and Diego yesterday. Another approximately 400 today. And that's according to local officials though they have arrived there they're going to rest they're going to receive some legal counsel. And then they would slowly begin the process likely of applying for asylum and that's what Quinn was just talking about that's still the legal process. At those ports and tree is to apply for asylum and that can take. Weeks so they could be waiting in these areas for awhile it's important to note that you know Mattis was down in the border in. Taxes at camp Donna but we're seeing most of these caravans moving to Tijuana in that region to California so. Large border what NASA is looking out was really Far East and read the many of the migrants are headed is really far last. So the migrants already showing up at showing up at him to be clear Elizabeth that established. Ports of entry they don't appear at least at this stage to be crossing illegally a large numbers Catherine the president had raised the Specter of this massive invasion but it's that doesn't seem to be materialized. No it doesn't and that also begs the question. I'm with the caravan and I'm talking about the images that he's seen on on Fox News whether this was all fear mongering before. Before the midterm elections really haven't heard and lamb talk too much about it really since then but Elizabeth one thing I was struck by a sitting in your note that you pour it was that. I'm a soldier and on the border was asking manna specifically about his short term plans amber says his long term plans for for Border Patrol and for their mission what exactly any sane and. Yeah and turns the short term I think mission Catherine ME they're really they're working in that concertina wire they're backing up CDP. There really isn't an answer right now to the long term mission and secretary Mattis told reporters and told those aren't soldiers they're going to be down their through Thanksgiving. On their right now set to leave an about mid December but they could be extended on this is an and military mission. One thing heat what did also not have an answer on is the cost of this missing admission that still something that we are waiting for. Here at the Pentagon and sending that Mattis really against that it. They're they're looking to gather all those costs they're keeping track of them but they don't have an estimate right now. Right Elizabeth McLaughlin force at the Pentagon thank you so much quit Nolan thank you very much for your reporting as well meanwhile. Up on Capitol Hill members of congress coming back after a break they are tracking what's going on the border of the border wall big part of that discussion but. This week has really been about welcoming new members in the party's retooling. Offering new divided congress that will come officially in January we've seen pictures here of the freshman class. Taking pictures today as those members come in for an orientation. On both sides and we have had at least on the Republican side. Both in the senate and the house some elections they have elected new leadership headed into the new year. Let me be very clear. If their agenda is simply. Investigations. Impeachment. And not focused on the hardworking American public. Will be there defend the American. All right so Republicans drawing a line in the sand against the expected onslaught of democratic led. Investigations in the new year let's bring in. I'm new democratic member of congress who will be joining that team come January congressman elect Joan goose joins us live from Capitol Hill he's been. Newly elected congressman from Colorado's second district the first African American. We should add elected to congress from Colorado and also one of the youngest members of congress at 34 years old Joan and it was. Great to have you with us wall like give us your early impressions of freshman orientation on Capitol Hill and any surprises so far. Get plenty also first thing keeper kept her out loud music on your program. It's it's a hopeful time I think for this country and certainly visiting with my fellow members of the freshman class. It's hard to come away from it with a real sense that their better days ahead for our country I think voters in this country sent a pretty resounding message in the the freshman class that they elected this past week and so. In my conversations it's pretty clear that we're all ready to get to work. Ready to get to work you've heard Kevin McCarthy there the Republican. A leader sound a warning against investigations are investigations of top priority for you. What's topped your list what would you tell your democratic leader to do. Yes oh. Think they certainly are we want to be clear and the congress has a constitutional duty. To engage in critical oversight of the executive branch in this administration. It's a duty that day the prior congress really abandoned and so that that is not something we're going to skirt from. I'm I think that the democratic majority and should be bold and making sure that work. A holding this administration accountable that being said. I also think this is a lot of policy proposals that we could potentially bridge the gap between both political parties and actually get something done for the American people. I think we can you know issue. I had Q2 gunmen walked the same time sure. And Joseph let me ask let's let's get into that a little bit you used during the campaign talked a lot about how impeachment should be one of the priorities and UN support moving forward on that. And do you do would you support articles of impeachment if they were brought today is that something you think should happen right out of the game January. You know I would it's and I made it pretty clear during a campaign that I thought there was sufficient evidence. At this juncture that it certainly I have seen and to begin impeachment proceedings that that was going to be important process for the congress. To engage can come of course now that we're gonna have I have national lot of conversations in the caucus and within you know that the house more broadly about the timing in and so forth but yeah I something has to support. How about health care and it's and they've been a top issue for voters the entire campaign certainly in your race you talk a lot about it. And you're one of the Democrats who supports a single Payer model what some are calling Medicare for all. Where do you put we're give us your your sense of the early prospects for that effort in the democratic led house do you think that that. We'll have some legs in the early days. I think so I'm you know I'm an eternal optimist perhaps that young and naive but I think got. I think if there is reason to be optimistic in part because of the incredible freshman class but that was just elected and all the apparently died seen suggests that. The American people strongly support a universal care system. They're obviously a variety of different legislative vehicles could be could pursue to get their Medicare for all is something and I certainly support an impassioned about. As one of those potential vehicles and there are a lot of new freshman. Members represented blacks who also support Medicare for all who I think are going to be meeting that drama next congress. And that's certainly an effort that I'm looking forward to being part up but again in a policy in and ultimately progress is Peter. There are a lot of things I think we can do in health care space to deliver for the American people and certainly people it in my district the second congressional district where. Folks are paying some of the highest health insurance rates in the country with respect to the individual exchange so I'm making some key changes to the Affordable Care Act perhaps increasing subsidies for. Rural areas and mountain communities. Those are conversations and I really would like. The authority and of course one person who will get to largely dictate. What those priorities are which where your party knows what comes to the far will we be the new speaker of the house. A lot of debate a monster party just this week over Nancy Pelosi whether she has the support. Offering that where do you stand on Nancy Pelosi do you support her will you support her in a house floor vote to be the next speaker. Don't look like it's important question I don't think he told I'm keeping an open mind for having a lot of conversations. Some of what you just alluded to with you know my fellow members of the freshman. Class and and we folks in leadership not just your policy but also many other folks who comp you know constitute the leadership team in the house. The talk to them about their vision for. The democratic majority and in the work that we should be engaged in over the course of the next two years so I'm looking forward to continuing those conversations and then and ultimately make a decision that that I think is in the best interest of the people of the second congressional districts don't have made a final decision yet. All right Joan Andrews noncommittal on Nancy Pelosi and an eternal optimist your optimism is infectious it's great to meet you Joseph thanks for joining us here in the briefing room on ABC news. Those to play through. And let's bring in our senior congressional correspondent Mary Brewster break that down a little bit more and provide some analysis. On the new congress merry great to have you up on Capitol Hill let's start with. We're Joseph left off on Nancy Pelosi is battle to be speaker. You bank are tracking the latest. In support and opposition to her what do we know about whether she has the votes. Interesting the way he walked that fine line there and look congressman accused is in good company there are planning of his. Fellow freshman Democrats who have yet to make up their mind and plenty of them. Who have said that they will not will never vote for Nancy Pelosi by our count that list is somewhere north of fourteen members could be. Up there around the twenties. In terms of numbers over a Democrat to say they simply cannot back the speaker they want. New blood they feel that that position cannot be held by Nancy Pelosi. But what's important to note Devean is that those who oppose anti Pelosi have yet to put up. Another candidate. What they think would do a better job than Pelosi so what she is still trying to get the votes she is. You know working things behind the scenes she's reaching out to new member she's calling in. Lot of big guns some of her political allies to make the case for her as well and I just would say even though. Right now she is still working to get north of 218 that's the number of votes that she needs to become an ex speaker of the house. I would. Really cautioned against underestimating Nancy Pelosi she is a fiercely against Eaton and negotiator shares of the sharpest elbows. Of any want. Appear on Capitol Hill and she knows better than anyone how to win votes and she is confident she told us again today she is 100% certain that she will be the next speaker of the house even have right now the numbers don't appear to be in her favor. And what's driving in that Mary for people who have followed polo sees long storied career. And are wondering why she has is a such a low approval rating new polls out today just 17%. Americans have a favorable approval of her that's a CNN poll but also this as you're still talking about and in her own party. Why is that why is she become. Much maligned by some. It's a really good question and I think there are several different factors at play here one is simply bet there's a desire to rein in some new blood today that you need someone. To come in and shake things up that they look at the party they they feel that things have not been. Heading in the direction they want it and they want new leadership. Doesn't remember the name to blows he's been a favorite target of the right to you we look back think backed out as campaign ads only hours dean just a week ago arguably the in the weeks since the mid terms. But but that she was a target for so many Republicans and in a lot of districts where you saw a lot of Democrats having to come out and say that they wouldn't standard Nancy Pelosi either. And that those arms many of those members now stills and that they can't support Lizzie are those who ran on that platform. I don't remember the that we now have the most diverse that congress and our history and a lot of people feel that bad that leadership needs to reflect the diversity. Invaded and it's time for for a bit of a change at the top because of that. And people are looking to the Democratic Party in a different direction especially all you'll talk to many new more progressive members. Feel that that it's time for a shake up so a lot of this get to the broader dynamics at play over the future of the Democratic Party. And I think a lot of people that feel that the party needs to go to different direction are those who are now saying I mean maybe it's not not now time for Pelosi to point out. It's going to be a tense leadership fight for the house Democrats we know you're gonna stay on top of that neighbors think you so much for joining us or for that analysis you found Mary's. Latest reported abcnews.com and of course coming up. On world news tonight I'm moving on the White House. Is also experiencing some of these winds of change around town after the election season in Catherine fall there's has the latest there. Long rumors of a senior staff shakeup in president trumps cabinet and senior staff we've been hearing this time and again in the march to the election it's happened. We seem to be on the cusp of something big rightly so we lost Jeff Sessions. The day after the mid terms and it we reported a yesterday that the president is again revived this talk of replacing his chief of staff John Kelly. Who has pledged to stay there quite funny but he's considering other options nick Ayers as vice president's chief of staff and also. Here's senior citizen lose today on here's a Nielsen yup you haven't the president just gave an interview to the daily caller and he had this to say. It was an interview in print that the president did say that he. It has is going to make this is short. Shortly Brett he was asked specifically about his Homeland Security secretary it was with mass ave the border today. Well how Long Will she be around Willy fire you see the quote right there and he's look he's looking at things he hasn't made a decision he says -- make it shortly. And it is resembles a little bit of his reaction to Jeff Sessions to when reporters were constantly asking about sessions he said. Come amid a decision yet but from my cabinet is great so. This is someone he is chief with for a long time particularly the issue of immigration is fascinating to seek your stimulus and at the border today with those aviator glasses looking top. But the president it's it's very clear increasingly clear has had it with her. Absolutely and John Kelly his chief of staff is is trying to find her some time over at the department but you're right they have sparred on immigration and Nielsen has sparred with John Bolten his national security advisor on immigration as well so it's happening and knew their feud and. And before you move on what's the latest on this feud between the deputy. National security advisor admirer of her cart all. And the first lady's office we saw yesterday and talked about here in the brief hearing that extraordinary statement by the First Lady saying she should be removed him and yet she still on the job today in the west went. A yes the First Lady release a statement on the record from her communications director saying. John Bolton is deputy near a record out should be removed. Now there's a statement right there and were told that she is actually apple work today despite the First Lady calling. A for her ouster is behind this do we have a sense get a in reporting why is she disliked but you know it's a good it's a good question we reported that I'm from our sources that we've talked to that she sparred with a number of people. In the west wing. Madness. Kelly Bolton and real personality personality. Our sources are taught us eight it's our key phone calls emails. So there really is saying it you know it it just has to do with her personality really among. The agency is deputies at agencies but that an unnamed official yesterday said. Coming to her defense and always saying what the firstly hasn't even Matt Kerr but again in house to do really with the staff of the first lady's office. All right little bit of apprentice style low yeah. Out of the and of the year in the west wing. I'm he model west wing is keeping a close eye on what's going on in Florida the outcome of midterm elections still lingering in several places let's bring in. Our Chris good joins us from New York political reporter an election expert who has been with her decision to ask. Tracking the latest on the recount fund Florida Chris.

To finish counting all ballots that there's an extremely tight races there a senate races with pin point 15 percentage points. Out of the governor's races separated by a little bit more. But it's really open air what's gonna happen as a court fight now over these deadlines and it's really unclear when this is going to be resolved. Unclear what's going on in Florida but also in Georgia. Close race there as well what do we know about the Georgia governor's race for the Georgia governor's race that's that's a state where the race was. Extremely close and you have two candidates who will. Who will continue to fight that out even after Election Day and say it's one of the number of races is still yet to be decided we saw the same. Drama sort of put out in Florida with things going on be on Election Day obviously see Stacy Abrams there it was hope.

But while they're missing out on the economic boost \u2014 for now \u2014 they've also dodged having to give away billions of dollars in tax incentives.\n\nAmazon's search for a new home resulted in some 238 suitors from across the continent that the company in January whittled down to 20, stretching from Toronto to Miami in the east to Denver and Los Angeles out west.\n\nThe prospect of new jobs and the cachet that comes with a tech behemoth like Amazon led many cities to pull together aggressive tax incentive packages worth billions of dollars, among other enticements.\n\nNewark, New Jersey, for instance, proposed $2 billion in tax incentives along with a potential $5 billion put up by the state.\n\n\"I think considering the size of the tax package we were offering, I think a lot of taxpayers are taking a sigh of relief,\" said Brandon McKoy, who heads government and public affairs at the progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. \"It was very exorbitant.\"\n\nThe other finalists were: Atlanta; Austin; Boston; Chicago; Dallas; Denver; Indianapolis; Montgomery County, Maryland; Nashville; Pittsburgh; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Washington.\n\nSome economic development experts argue that giving up billions in tax revenue through incentive programs was a flawed mindset from the start.\n\nRichard Florida, an urban development expert at the University of Toronto, cast Amazon's search in stark terms, suggesting the company \"played\" cities against each other to get the best deal, while also scoping out potential future locations for business hubs.\n\nHe compared the selection process to the televised talent competition, \"American Idol.\"\n\n\"We can get back to doing economic development the right way, not through these Amazon Idol competitions,\" he said.\n\nNew York offered Amazon more than $1.5 billion in tax credits and other incentives while Virginia and Arlington ponied up about $573 million.\n\nBut the tax incentives were not the only factor for Amazon. Indeed, the chosen sites had offered less than other places. Amazon has said it picked locations best suited to attract the high-skilled workers it's seeking.\n\nThat's small consolation to places left to soul-search what they could have done differently.\n\n\"We competed hard, we competed well, but we did not succeed,\" said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, whose city was a contender. \"It calls upon us, as leaders in this city, to look hard at ourselves and say, 'Why can we not beat New York City and Washington, D.C.?\"\n\nOthers cast the loss in a positive light.\n\n\"It put Philadelphia in the national (and international) spotlight \u2014 increasing our visibility to other companies and showing our viability for other large-scale projects,\" said Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney in a statement.\n\nFor all the time and energy expended on the process, there's also a sense of relief to finally be done with it, even if the outcome for most wasn't as hoped.\n\n\"I'm glad it's over,\" said Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. \"It's just a lot of anxiety, a lot of waiting.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Jamie Stengle and Jim Anderson contributed to this report.\n\npho"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Fatal California fires spur search for solutions", "description": "Creating fire buffers between housing and dry brush and burying spark-prone power lines underground would give people a better chance of surviving wildfires, experts say", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/fatal-california-fires-spur-search-solutions-59201378", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_9f90e736a4a446a6b7bb8a2409f7a44c_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:32:41Z", "content": "Creating fire buffers between housing and dry brush, burying spark-prone power lines and lighting more controlled burns to keep vegetation in check could give people a better chance of surviving wildfire s, according to experts searching for ways to reduce th\u2026 [+6670 chars]", "fulltext": "Creating fire buffers between housing and dry brush, burying spark-prone power lines and lighting more controlled burns to keep vegetation in check could give people a better chance of surviving wildfires, according to experts searching for ways to reduce growing death tolls from increasingly severe blazes in California and across the U.S. West.\n\nWestern wildfires have grown ever more lethal, a grim reality that's been driven by more housing developments sprawling into the most fire-prone grasslands and brushy canyons, experts say. Many of the ranchers and farmers who once managed those landscapes are gone, leaving neglected terrain that has grown thick with vegetation that can explode into flames when sparked.\n\nThat's left communities ripe for tragedy as whipping winds and recurring drought that's characteristic of climate change stoke wildfires like the ones still raging in Northern and Southern California that have killed at least 51 people in recent days.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were told to leave their homes ahead of the blazes to get out of harm's way. Yet some experts say there's been an over-reliance on evacuation and too little attention paid to making communities safe, as well as not enough money for controlled burns and other preventive measures.\n\nSearch crews found many victims inside their vehicles, or just next to them, overcome by flames, heat and smoke as they tried to flee. Survivors of the blaze that nearly obliterated the Northern California town of Paradise and nearby communities spoke of having just minutes to escape and narrow roads made impassable by flames and traffic jams.\n\n\"There are ... so many ways that can go wrong, in the warning, the modes of getting the message out, the confusion ... the traffic jams,\" said Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension program.\n\nAs deadly urban wildfires become more common, officials should also consider establishing \"local retreat zones, local safety zones\" in communities where residents can ride out the deadly firestorms if escape seems impossible, Moritz said.\n\nThat could be a community center, built or retrofitted to better withstand wildfires, which can exceed 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, leaving little trace of ordinary homes.\n\nSuch fire protection measures in buildings can include sprinklers, fire- and heat-resistant walls and roofs, and barriers that keep sparks out of chimneys and other openings, according to the International Code Council, a nonprofit that helps develop building codes used widely in the United States.\n\nCreating more buffers \u2014 whether parks, golf courses or irrigated agriculture, like the vineyards that helped keep 2017 wildfires in California's wine country from spreading into even more towns \u2014 around new and old housing developments would help stave off wildfires threatening to overrun cities and towns.\n\nSo would burying electric power lines, which can spark and fail in the high winds that drive many of California's fiercest fires, said Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey in California.\n\nSparks from electrical utility equipment are suspects in the Northern California wildfire that consumed Paradise, destroying some 7,700 homes, and other deadly blazes in the state.\n\nA proven method to prevent wildfires from getting out of control is the use of controlled burns. By intentionally lighting fires, property owners or land managers can remove dead and low-lying trees and brush \u2014 material that otherwise accumulates and can accelerate the growth of fires.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, California ranchers burned hundreds of thousands of acres annually to manage their lands, said Lenya Quinn-Davidson, director of the Northern California Prescribed Fire Council.\n\nThat was phased out in the 1980s after California's fire management agency stepped in to take over the burns, and by the last decade, the amount of acreage being treated had dropped to less than 10,000 acres annually, Quinn-Davidson said.\n\nFormer agricultural land that rings many towns in the state became overgrown, even as housing developments pushed deeper into those rural areas. That was the situation in the Northern California town of Redding leading up to a fire that began in July and destroyed more than 1,000 homes. It was blamed for eight deaths.\n\n\"You get these growing cities pushing out \u2014 housing developments going right up into brush and wooded areas. One ignition on a bad day, and all that is threatened,\" Quinn-Davidson said. \"These fires are tragic, and they're telling us this is urgent. We can't sit on our hands.\"\n\nThe latest California fires have fueled debate over the reasons for ever-more deadly wildfires, with President Donald Trump claiming in a tweet Saturday that \"gross mismanagement of the forests\" was the sole reason the state's fires had become so \"massive, deadly and costly.\" He also threatened to withhold federal payments to the state.\n\nHowever, most of California's deadly fires of recent years have been in grasslands and brushy chaparral, Keeley said.\n\n\"Most of the fires we've been seeing in the last couple years that are the most destructive are not in the forest. Thinning isn't going to change anything,\" he said.\n\nTrump's assertion also ignored the huge federal land holdings in the state and brought a quick backlash, with the president of the California firefighters union describing it as a shameful attack on thousands of firefighters on the front lines.\n\nTo ease tensions, the White House sent Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to tour fire-damaged areas and offer assistance to California Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nIn an interview prior to the two-day visit, which began Wednesday, Zinke struck a conciliatory tone and said federal officials share blame for not managing public forest and rangelands aggressively enough.\n\n\"We need to work in unison to make sure we thin the forest, especially fire breaks, and make sure we have prescribed burns,\" Zinke told The Associated Press. \"There's been a lack of management on Interior lands, on U.S. Forest Service lands and certainly with state lands.\"\n\nBut it's California, not the Trump administration that is putting more money behind such efforts.\n\nIn response to the deadly blazes of recent years, California lawmakers in September approved a measure that would provide $1 billion over five years for fire protection, including more controlled burns and projects to thin forests and brush land.\n\nBy contrast, federal spending on hazardous fuels reduction has been flat in recent years, hovering just under $600 million, even as direct firefighting costs jumped to a record $2.9 billion last year.\n\nFor 2019, the Forest Service has proposed a $3 million bump for its wildfire fuels program. At Interior, Zinke proposed a $29 million cut in fuel management spending.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Matthew Brown on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MatthewBrownAP"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Newly elected House members arrive on Capitol Hill", "description": "Congressman-elect Joe Neguse speaks on freshman orientation, health care and Colorado.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/newly-elected-house-members-arrive-capitol-hill-59201379", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/181114_tbr_neguse_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:32:36Z", "content": "Now Playing: 2018 midterms shake up Washington Now Playing: Midterms deliver crop of groundbreaking winners Now Playing: Sen.

Newly elected congressman from Colorado second district the first African American. We should add elected to congress from Colorado and also one of the youngest members of congress at 34 years old Joseph noose. Great to have you with us wall like give us your early impressions of freshman orientation on Capitol Hill and he any surprises so far. Get plenty also first thing keeper kept her out loud music on your program. It's it's a hopeful time I think god for this country and certainly visiting with my fellow members of the freshman. The class. It's hard to come away from it with a real sense that it their better days ahead for our country I think voters in this country sent a pretty resounding message in the the freshman class that they elected this past week and so. In my conversations it's pretty clear that we're all ready to get to work. Ready to get to work you've heard Kevin McCarthy then a Republican. Leaner sound a warning against investigations are investigations of top priority for you. What's topped your list what would you tell your democratic leader to do. Eight yes I think they certainly are Melanie be clear and the congress has a constitutional duty to engage in critical oversight and the executive branch in this administration. It's a duty to fit the prior congress really abandoned and so that that is not something we're going to skirt from. I'm I think that the democratic majority I should be bold and making sure that work. Holding this administration accountable that being said. I also think this is a lot of policy proposals that we could potentially bridge the gap between both political parties and actually get something done for the American people. I think we can you know issue. I hit you chew gum and walk at the same time. Sure and Joseph let me ask let's let's. Get into that a little bit you used during the campaign talked a lot about how impeachment should be one of the priorities in UN support moving forward on that. Do you do would you support articles of impeachment if they were brought today is that something you think should happen right out of the game January. You know I woods and I made it pretty clear during the campaign that I thought there was sufficient evidence at this juncture that that certainly I had seen. And to begin impeachment proceedings that that was going to be important process for the congress. To engage and come of course now that we're gonna have I have national lot of conversations in the caucus and within you know that the house more broadly about the timing in and so forth but yeah I'd something has to support. How about health care and it's a Ben Bennett top issue for voters the entire campaign certainly in your race you talk a lot about it. And you're one of the Democrats who supports a single Payer model what some are calling Medicare for all. Where do you put we're give us your your sense of the early prospects for that effort and the democratic led house do you think that that. We'll have some legs in the early days. I think so I'm you know I'm eternal optimist perhaps that young and naive that I think got. I think if there is reason to be optimistic in part because of the incredible freshman class but that was just elected and all the apparently died scenes suggests that. The American people strongly support a universal care system. They're obviously a variety of different legislative vehicles that we could pursue to get their Medicare for all something and I certainly support and impassioned about. As one of those potential vehicles and there are a lot of new freshman. Members represented blacks to also support Medicare for all who I think are going to be beating that drum in the next congress. And that's certainly an effort that I'm looking forward to being part of but again in a policy in and ultimately progress is Peter. There are a lot of things I think we can do in health care space to deliver for the American people and certainly people. It in my district the second congressional district where folks are panes of the highest health insurance rates in the country with respect to the individual exchanged. I'm making some some changes to the Affordable Care Act perhaps increasing subsidies for rural areas in mountain communities those are conversations and I really would like. The apart and of course one person who will get to largely dictate. What those priorities are which for your party knows what comes to the far wolf will be the new speaker of the house. A lot of debate amongst your party just this week over Nancy Pelosi whether she has the support. Offering that where do you stand and Nancy Pelosi do you support her will you support her inane. House floor vote to be the next speaker. Yeah look like it's important question I don't think he told I'm keeping an open mind for having a lot of conversations. Some what you just alluded to with you know my fellow members of the freshman. Class and and we folks in leadership not just leader Pelosi and also many other folks who comp you know constitute the leadership team in the house. To talk to them about their vision for.

Marcia Fudge, a veteran Ohio Democrat, bluntly called for a challenger to step up and face off against Pelosi. Though she flirted with the idea of taking on Pelosi herself, she emphasized that she is looking for someone else to step forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear I\u2019m not going to be voting for the current leader,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to run, but there are a number of people who I think are capable. And so we are exploring, talking to those people.\u201d\n\nBut Fudge would not slam the door on a potential bid herself.\n\n\u201cI never really thought much about it to be perfectly honest. I would say this, as we tout diversity in this party, there\u2019s no diversity in our leadership. As we talk about the base of our party \u2013 black and brown \u2013 there are no black and brown people in our leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk about it, we\u2019re going to talk the talk, we need to walk the walk.\u201d\n\nRep. Tim Ryan, an ally in the quest to identify an alternative to Pelosi, floated Fudge as a possibility, stressing he wants the Midwest to have a seat at the table.\n\n\u201cThere are several candidates out there that are great candidates that you know we have a very talented caucus, a lot of talent, and we just have to figure out who it\u2019s going to be, you know, if anybody,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut you know we\u2019re going to bring change. The people want change.\u201d\n\nWhile Rep. Steny Hoyer has announced he has at least 155 Democratic signatures in support of his bid for majority leader, he refused to predict whether his play for the number two position could unravel if Pelosi\u2019s campaign for speaker falls short.\n\n\u201cEverybody likes to talk about personalities. [What\u2019s] much more important to the American people are the policies that we pursue,\u201d Hoyer, D-Md., said. \u201cThe personalities will take care of themselves but the policies is what we\u2019re going to really focus on.\u201d\n\nWith several incoming Democratic freshmen vowing to oppose Pelosi on the campaign trail, many are now tight-lipped about the allegiance, waiting to see whether any contested races emerge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of listening, learning and navigating to do,\u201d Rep.-elect Dean Phillips told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019ll be visiting with [Pelosi] later this week, and a number of others, and like I said, listen and learn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am uncommitted. I\u2019m not sure if there will be other candidates putting themselves forward, but I want to be fair,\u201d Rep.-elect Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., said. \u201cI haven\u2019t met with the leader as of yet. We\u2019re going to be sitting down.\u201d\n\nJoseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI have not declared, and I\u2019m really looking forward to understanding fully who\u2019s running and what their agenda is and if it\u2019s aligned with the best interests of the families across Illinois\u2019 14 district,\u201d said Lauren Underwood, D-Illinois.\n\nRep.-elect Jeff Van Drew stressed he made a commitment to supporters and \u201cI\u2019m going to keep that commitment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI come from a tough district, that requires a lot out of me, and I give it back to them. So when I tell you or my constituent, when I tell them something, I stick to it, Van Drew, D-N.J., said. \u201cWe\u2019re a big tent and it makes the party look good if we have different ideas.\u201d\n\nOther veteran Democratic lawmakers have also refused to publicly endorse or oppose Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll resolve that in the coming weeks,\u201d said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, throwing up his hands in defense of an onslaught of questions about the speaker\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWhat a pleasant problem to have,\u201d Rep.

Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nRepublican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware attempted to force a vote on a bill that would prevent Mueller from being fired without \u201cgood cause.\u201d\n\nTheir efforts came in light of Jeff Sessions being forced out of his post as attorney general last week and the subsequent appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nIn his new role, Whitaker takes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s place as the lead overseer of the Russia probe. Sessions had previously recused himself of all Justice Department activity related to the investigation into Russian meddling. Now, lawmakers are concerned that Whitaker\u2019s objectivity is compromised because of his vocal criticism before joining the administration.\n\nFlake and Coons sought unanimous consent from their Senate colleagues for the measure late Wednesday but that failed after an objection from Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nThe bipartisan Mueller protection legislation formally named the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in April but has seen no floor action.\n\nThe bill codifies existing DOJ regulations to ensure that the special counsel can only be fired for good cause by a Senate-confirmed DOJ official. Whitaker has not been confirmed by the Senate for his current post.\n\nIt also provides the special counsel with a 10-day window in which he can seek expedited judicial review of his removal to determine whether the firing was for good cause. If the firing is ultimately determined to have violated the good-cause requirement, the special counsel cannot be removed.\n\nLastly, the bill would preserve the staffing, documents, and materials of the investigation while the matter is pending.\n\n\u201cThe leader has always said 'there\u2019s no need for this because nobody's been fired, the special counsel is fine.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think anyone can say that after Jeff Sessions\u2019 forced removal,\u201d Flake told ABC News on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, he followed up his remarks by threatening retribution on Senate Republicans to withhold his vote on judicial nominations.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\"I have informed the Majority Leader that I will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee, or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting a confirmation vote on the floor, until [the bill] is brought to the full Senate for a vote,\" Flake announced on the Senate floor after McConnell objected to the measure.\n\nHis decision to withhold his vote on judicial nominations would draw ire from McConnell, who has previously said confirming judges to federal courts is a top priority.\n\nMcConnell has downplayed the necessity of the Mueller protection bill, saying the bipartisan legislation is not needed at this time because of assurances he has been given by President Trump that he does not intend to fire Mueller.\n\n\u201cI mean there's been no indication, as you can imagine \u2013 I talk to the president fairly often \u2013 no indication that the Mueller investigation will not be allowed to finish, and it should be allowed to finish,\u201d McConnell told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nHe went on: \u201cWe know how the president feels about the Mueller investigation but he has never said he wants to shut it down. I've never heard anybody down there say they want to shut it down. I think it's in no danger and so I don't think any legislation is necessary.\u201d\n\nBut several other Republicans have said they would vote for the bill, including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\nGraham told ABC News on Tuesday: \u201cWe bring it to the floor I\u2019ll definitely vote on it. I don\u2019t see any movement to fire Mueller, but legislatively it\u2019d probably be good to put it into law for the future.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Graham told CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation that he doesn't think Whitaker should recuse himself from overseeing Mueller's investigation. He also said he intends to meet him sometime this week.\n\nAt least one Republican said he thinks the Mueller protection bill would be unconstitutional and he said he doesn\u2019t think Whitaker will do anything to jeopardize the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the man to bash him before he even has a chance to find the men\u2019s room,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats, however, are insisting that if a standalone bill does not get a chance on the Senate floor, then it must be included in a must-pass spending bill due by Dec. 7.\n\nSchumer on Tuesday said that Democrats will \u201cattempt to add legislation to the must-pass spending bill in the lame duck session that will prevent acting Attorney General Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nGrassley, who\u2019s charged with overseeing the DOJ as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on Tuesday insisted he felt reassured by Trump\u2019s assurances on the matter.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that the president's the chief executive and the president said that he wasn't going to do that, so doesn't matter what Whitaker thinks,\u201d Grassley told reporters.\n\nGrassley also said that as long as Whitaker made comments about the Mueller probe as a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d he\u2019s not concerned about any bias he may have.\n\nOn the bill to protect the special counsel investigation, Grassley said he supports it.\n\n\u201cThe answer is if it comes to a vote, I will vote for that bill.

Some of the Marie Antoinette jewelry hadn't been seen in public for 200 years \u2014 until now.\n\nLike many of the 10 former Marie Antoinette pieces up for sale, the pendant obliterated the pre-auction estimate \u2014 in its case, $1 million to $2 million. It sold for a hammer price of 32 million Swiss francs ($32 million), but with the buyer's premium and fees, the total sale rose to more than $36.1 million.\n\nThe buyer wanted to remain anonymous, the auction house said.\n\nAll told, the Marie Antoinette pieces reaped nearly $43 million.\n\nThe diamond and pearl jewelry of Marie Antoinette that went under the hammer epitomized the aloof, pre-Revolutionary opulence of French royals brought down by the uprising. The wife of King Louis XVI, she was executed in France's revolutionary fervor in 1793.\n\nBefore falling to the guillotine, she had secretly smuggled abroad some of her most treasured possessions to her relatives amid rising the revolutionary fervor that ultimately marked the beginning of the end of France's centuries-old monarchy.\n\n\"The Marie Antoinette pendant is simply irreplaceable,\" Eddie LeVian, CEO of jewelers Le Vian, said before the sale. \"This is about far more than the gems themselves: Marie Antoinette's jewelry is inextricably linked to the cause of the French Revolution.\"\n\nThe queen's jewelry also included a set of pearl and diamond earrings, a diamond brooch, and a natural pearl and diamond necklace. A monogrammed, diamond-set ring bears a lock of Marie Antoinette's hair.\n\nNearly all of those lots far outstripped the pre-sale estimates, a testament to the difficulty in assessing the value of such rarely available jewels.\n\n\"It was really the Bourbon-Parma factor, plus certainly the Marie Antoinette factor,\" said Daniela Mascetti, Sotheby's chairman for jewelry in Europe. \"Prices really rocketed. Some items sold for, I think, 20 or 25 times more than the presale estimate.\"\n\nAdded Andres White Correns, senior director for jewelry: \"We had said when we did the press conference for this sale that this was going to be the sale of this century \u2014 and I think that the results tonight prove that this is the case.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Troye Sivan says his new movie has a message for parents", "description": "The singer and actor talks about his growing success and how filming \"Boy Erased\" gave him a new appreciation for his album.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/theview/video/troye-sivan-movie-message-parents-59197962", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/theview/181114_view_view_troye_sivan_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:00:30Z", "content": "Now Playing: 'Boy Erased' star on his skyrocketing career Now Playing: Troye Sivan says his new movie has a message for parents Now Playing: 'GMA' Hot List: Dierks Bentley celebrates his birthday Now Playing: You have to see the reaction this adorable viral v\u2026 [+1204 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Troye Sivan says his new movie has a message for parents\n\nto this,\" and now he's bringing his acting and musical talents to the powerful new movie \"Boy erased.\" He plays a young man forced to undergo gay conversion therapy and gives co-star Lucas hedges tips on how to survive.

Please welcome troye Sivan. ??? So, for those of you -- for those of you who don't know, I'm going to give you a little background. You started singing and posting videos on YouTube when you were 12. Hm-mm. And since then your life has kind of changed a bit. You have over 9 million social media followers and youalbum, and you performed on \"Saturday night live.\" How's all this feeling? I mean, it's crazy. Very, very, very often I take a moment to kind of pause and think about how I would have felt if I could show myself like five years ago what's going on now, you know? I really try to do it as often as I can because it's like at this point it feels like every day I get to do something that, um, you know, I could have only dreamt of a long time ago. So it feels good. Speaking of things you could have dreamt of, I understand you are a big fan of Taylor Swift and last summer you performed at the rose bowl with her. How did that come about and what was that like? So originally -- Look at you guys. The strut. Originally it was me just asking if I can get tickets to the show. Wow. Then she said yes, if I perform with her. So yeah, before I knew it, I was under the stage and did the whole popup thing. The popup thing is the best, right? Yeah, with the smoke, so good. So when you were 18 you came out publicly, correct? Yes. And also on YouTube. Yep. The interesting thing about coming out at that point was you were about to sign a record deal which could have possibly, you know, thwarted your career but you decided to do it. Why? Because of that exact reason actually. I at that point, thankfully, was sort of secure enough in myself and confident enough in myself that I knew that it was like a necessity for me to come out. I decided that I couldn't live without being completely truthful and open and honest. So I didn't want to ever give anyone that power to say no, don't come out right now because it will be bad for sales or whatever, I don't know. I just wanted to kind of completely take that in -- You took a risk. You took a risk and it worked. I'm so happy I did it. It paid off. It did. Let's talk about your new movie \"Boy erased\" which is such an incredible film. It's so nuanced. It's a true story, actually, based on the best selling book by Garrard Conley about his time at a gay converse camp. It has a great cast, you, Nicole kidman, Russell Crowe. You said you hope this movie speaks to parents in particular. What should it say to parents? So I think the thing that I learned while on this movie, while working on this movie, it kind of surprised me. I wasn't nearly as angry as I thought I was going to be at the parents who send their kids off to these programs. And I think the reason is because you see this family, it's a family story and they're just scared. They're really, really scared for their kid. Because they love him. They love him a lot and they want to do what they think is right so they turn to the people that they trust the most which is their faith and they think that they're doing the right thing. What I'm hoping is that this movie is going to kind of play out what happens when you send your kid to conversion therapy and you get to from the comfort of a movie theatre or your own home watch how that works out for so many people. Hopefully by the end of the movie you'll see that it is absolutely not the way to go about things, you know. Well, in fact, the leader of the conversion camp that the real Garrard -- is that how you say his name? He left in 2008 and is now married to a man. So that's ironic and interesting. Right. The other part of the movie that we just saw a clip of where you're saying to this other boy, just play dumb, make believe you're converting. Yeah, yeah. Is that a fact, does it happen like that? Yeah, I mean, I think honestly kids are lucky if they make it out alive, you know. It leads to depression and anxiety and suicide a lot of the time. It's still happening in 36 states across the U.S. That's what was fascinating to me because they explore that at the end of the movie, that it's still legal and it's still going on. Totally. I'm shocked by that, I got to tell you. I grew up in a really religious environment and community where this is still going on. Like it's emotional to even see this movie and to talk about it. You would think it was made in the '90s but this is still so real. I had friends who took their life because parents think they can change them. They think they can take the devil as they called it out of them and turn them into somebody else. I think what you're doing is so, so powerful and it's going to impact more lives than you realize. But you not only did this film, you were making an album at the same time called \"Bloom.\" Did your perspective change when you finished filming and finished making that album? Completely, yeah. I mean, I kind of was almost done with the album and had to put it on pause to go film this movie. Really, really immersed myself in the movie for the time that we were filming and then when I was finished with it I was so just relieved. It felt like the biggest weight off my chest that I consider myself so unbelievably lucky that I get to go back to my big gay life and make this gay album. You know, it's like -- That's because you have parents who understood you. I think for lots of -- I think for lots of parents having a gay child is problematic for them because they don't want to say the wrong thing. They don't know how they're supposed to act because a lot of this is brand new for folks and then you get into gender diversity and people are kind of like so -- you know, parents have to understand, you know, we've all gone through this -- or maybe not everybody but I know a whole bunch of people have. You know someone who has gone through it. You know someone who has. It's also important to say this movie really holds people's hands through that process, you know what I mean? It's very patient. It doesn't point fingers at anyone, doesn't villainize anyone. I really think everyone should see it. I hope they will. And the great thing is that these parents actually love their kid. That's the bottom line. You have to come back. I want to, please. Any time. So, you need to see -- I'm sorry, my bad. Our thanks to troye Sivan. His movie, \"Boy erased,\" is in theaters now and nationwide this Friday.

He has also not used the term \"invasion.\"\n\nLast week, Mattis instructed that the name \"Operation Faithful Patriot\" be dropped and instead refer to the deployment as a border support mission.

Parent first lady Melania trump made a very unusual public statement declaring that deputy national secretary adviser Mirra ricardel no longer deserves the honor of serving in the white house. Melania apparently thinks ricardel is leaking information and clashed with her over her trip to Africa. I guess people are saying is she overstepping her bounds by making it public? Is this just more smoke and mirrors? What's happening? I like when she says she no longer deserves the honor. Tell that to Michael Cohen, Sean spicer. See how honored they were to work in this white house. Half of them are being indicted for god's sakes. If they're not quitting or getting hired, they're going to jail. Some honor. I was surprised to see this because historically you know that first ladies do tend to work behind the scenes and have complaints about people and they have certainly their husband's ears. Hillary Clinton in the west wing -- clearly George Stephanopoulos has written about that. Nancy Reagan too. Mary Todd Lincoln, a long history of it. But there isn't a history of a first lady putting out a public statement, an official statement saying something-like that. I don't know if it's because her husband sort of conducts his business that way in the open or maybe it's the age we're in. Maybe she's jealous of all the drama and she wants to be in the middle of it too. Nothing about this white house has Normal precedent. President trump doesn't even fire people. Remember he tweeted about James Comey and James Comey found out when he was on a trip in California. It sounds like behind the scenes Melania trump has been trying to get this woman out because this happened during the Africa trip is when it started. That was weeks ago, a couple months ago. It sounds like a clash between her and John Bolton who is this woman's boss and she feels the only way to be listened to is to go public which is strange. Isn't it odd for the first lady to do this. I don't know what's worse, leaking or doing it publicly. That's how I roll. I'm a straight shooter. If I have a problem I'm not going to leak stuff. The one thing I will say is the Africa trip as we talked about on this show wasn't totally received globally. We talked about the pith helmet, the controversial attire. If this woman is telling her something she doesn't want to hear, maybe she should start listening to things you don't want to hear. You got to surround yourself with people who aren't going to be yes men telling you what you want to hear every day. To that point, why isn the person who encouraged her to wear that jacket on her way to the border, I don't really care, do you -- she should fire herself. What Melania has accused this woman of is leaking and where I would disagree with Meghan a little bit is this white house is famous for leaks and the people that are in that white house, they still haven't gotten control of that. There has to be frustration with Melania. What are you trying to say, whoopi? I was going to make a really terrible joke and you can't make it. Everyone in the white house leaks everything. That's the problem. It's the root of all problems in all organizations when you're trying to build morale anyplace. If you have a leaking problem, it will fester like a virus. We've often talked about how people in this white house aren't necessarily qualified for the positions that they have and that's been very problematic. But this woman, I did some research and she does appear to be qualified for her position. She's been the deputy national security adviser for seven months but she also attended Georgetown university school of foreign service, did doctorate work at tuft's university and she's held three positions -- It doesn't matter if she's Albert Einstein. Melania doesn't like her. She appears to be qualified for her position.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "PG&E says it contacted resident about shut-off power line", "description": "A utility accused in a lawsuit of igniting California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire says it contacted a customer about a power line on her property", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/pge-contacted-resident-shut-off-power-line-59200464", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_56d2d51a476947a69c9f8771110e523b_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:56:26Z", "content": "A utility accused in a lawsuit of igniting California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire said it contacted a customer about a power line on her property but that sparks were not part of the discussion.

In his 2018 race to represent West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, Ojeda came up short behind the Republican candidate but managed 43.6 percent of the vote. The previous Democrat running in that district lagged 23 points behind that number in 2016.\n\nOjeda told the podcast he voted for Trump in 2016 largely because of his promise to restore the coal industry, which would help families in his district.\n\n\u201cWhen I look around where I was from, I saw people that were struggling greatly and I know that you now I got back to the coal industry. I come from the coal fields,\u201d Ojeda said. \u201cAnd he was the one that was talking about helping the people to be able to put food on the table to feed their families.\u201d\n\nSince 2016, though, Ojeda has been critical of Trump and the president hasn\u2019t shied away from firing back.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has returned the favor by going to West Virginia and calling you \u2018a total wacko\u2019 and \u2018stone cold crazy,\u2019 Klein said. \"What do you call President Trump back when he says things like this?\u201d\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\n\u201cWell, you know I called him \u2018President Bone Spurs,\u2019\u201d Ojeda said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that has no problems using veterans as props.

He says that although he failed in his House bid, he can still draw broad support in a run for president because he is a Democrat that cares about the working class.\n\n\u201cIf you look at middle America and the reason why it\u2019s so red is because the Democratic Party cannot relate to them. They definitely have not done anything to support people from where I come from in West Virginia,\u201d Ojeda said. \u201cThe letters and things like that that we received educated me that the problems we have in southern West Virginia are the same problems that we have all across the United States of America.\u201d\n\nMichael MathesAFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe first pillar of his campaign, he says, is combating corruption. Ojeda wants to make sure that those elected to federal positions are willing to sacrifice in order to relate to their constituents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying right now that if you\u2019re going to serve this nation in a federal position you need to start proving that you\u2019re willing to sacrifice first. I\u2019m saying ... that people are sick and tired of the millionaires running the system,\u201d Ojeda told Klein and Karl.\n\nThe results of the midterm elections in the House seem to reflect that sentiment.

I think that\u2019s why you saw the abrupt firing of Sessions,\u201d Karl said of the election. \u201cThere is a churn, there is an uneasiness that I am sensing in the West Wing. The president feels restless to me. There are a lot of triggers that you feel are about to be pulled, but aren\u2019t pulled.\u201d\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is on her way out of the Trump administration, according to Karl\u2019s sources, which could lead to a shuffle of other administrative positions, Karl said.\n\n\"Powerhouse Politics\" also talked with ABC News correspondent Paula Faris about her new podcast \"Journeys of FAITH with Paula Faris.\" Faris launched the podcast on the premise that faith plays a large role in most everyone\u2019s lives, but is rarely talked about in the public sphere. She would like to change that.\n\n\u201cI do want to talk to a lot of politicians about their particular faith and he role that faith does play in policy and in their decisions. Because, some will say \u2018Well, I\u2019m personally, you know, anti-abortion, but when it comes to policy I don\u2019t believe that the government has a role in that,\u2019\u201d Faris said.\n\nEvery Wednesday, ABC Radio and iTunes bring you the Powerhouse Politics Podcast which includes headliner interviews and in-depth looks at the people and events shaping U.S. politics.

By next year, the number of stores offering delivery is expected to double.\n\nThe partnership to use self-driving cars for delivery, ahead of, say, commuting, was a good way for Ford to get into the autonomous game without too much risk, experts said.\n\n\"Doubling down on the commercial side of self-driving technology is a safer bet for Ford, but could be one that pays off well in the end.

Moreover, we look forward to the day when the true culprit(s) will be discovered and brought to justice for this terrible tragedy.\"\n\n'Killed in cold blood'\n\nSeven of the Rhoden family members were discovered dead on April 22, 2016, in three separate homes along the same road in Peebles, a small village about 70 miles east of Cincinnati, while the eighth victim was found nearby in Piketon, according to officials. Many appeared to have been shot in their sleep, and one of the women was found lying in bed with a 4-day-old baby.\n\n\"All eight victims were killed in cold blood,\" DeWine, who is now Ohio's governor-elect, told reporters Tuesday. \"They were shot in their own homes. They were brutally and viciously executed.\"\n\nThe 4-day-old was one of three children, along with a 6-month old and a 3-year-old, that were found unharmed at the three crime scenes, police said.\n\nOhio Attorney General\n\nDeWine accused the Wagners of spending months carefully planning the murder of the victims, who he characterized as friends of theirs. The Wagners \"studied the victims' habits and routines. They knew the layouts of their homes. They knew where they slept,\" according to the attorney general.\n\n\u201c \u201d All eight victims were killed in cold blood. They were shot in their own homes. They were brutally and viciously executed.\n\n\"The killers knew the territory and meticulously planned these horrendous murders,\" DeWine said.\n\nThe suspects allegedly purchased ammunition, a magazine clip, brass catchers and a bug detector in preparation for the crimes, according to their indictments.\n\nAndrew Welsh-Huggins/AP, FILE\n\n\"They did this quickly, coldly, calmly and very carefully, but not carefully enough,\" Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader told reporters at Tuesday's press conference. He described the crime scenes as something he'll never be able to un-see.\n\n\"Images of the houses, the bodies, the scenes, I can never erase them,\" the sheriff said. \"Even 20 years of law enforcement experience cannot prepare you fully for a day like that.\"\n\nCustody battle 'plays a role'\n\nThe Wagners allegedly tampered with evidence after the murders were carried out, including cameras, a silencer, shell casings, parts of a home security system and the victims' cellphones, DeWine said. They face additional charges, including, conspiracy, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, tampering with evidence, unlawful possession of a dangerous ordinance, aggravated burglary for allegedly breaking into the homes to carry out the murders, unauthorized use of property, obstruction of justice, interception of wire, oral or electronic communications and forgery for allegedly forging child custody documents, according to DeWine.\n\nWhile the attorney general did not discuss the motive of the murders, DeWine said the custody of a young child \"plays a role in this case.\"\n\nOhio Attorney General/Pike County Sheriff\n\n\u201c \u201d The Wagners eagerly look forward to their trials, and to have their day in court so they can vindicate their names ... Moreover, we look forward to the day when the true culprit(s) will be discovered and brought to justice for this terrible tragedy.\n\nJake Wagner is also charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly having sexual contact with Hanna May Rhoden when she was 15 and he was 20, DeWine said. Jake Wagner is the father of Hanna May Rhoden's older daughter, who was staying with the Wagners on the night the homicides took place, according to DeWine.\n\nThe mothers of both Angela Wagner and Billy Wagner, Rita Newcomb, 65, and Fredericka Wagner, 76, respectively, are also facing felony charges of obstructing justice and perjury for allegedly misleading authorities over the course of the investigation, DeWine said. Newcomb is also charged with forgery.\n\nAll of the suspects were arrested without incident. The family members are currently being housed in separate facilities, according to the sheriff.\n\nPike County Prosecutor Rob Junk cautioned that the trials could last several years and the case may have to be relocated due to the publicity.\n\n\"There is a lot of hard work ahead of us.

Searches in the other winner of Amazon's sweepstakes, Crystal City, Virginia, jumped 84 percent. Real estate agents say they're hearing from investors who'd like to become landlords and from sellers who've decided to pull their homes off the market, sit back and wait for prices to go up, up, up.\n\nThe surge of interest has followed Amazon's selection of those two areas to each receive 25,000 new jobs paying an average of $150,000.\n\nThe two localities already reflect the ultra-pricey New York and Washington metro areas, though real estate sales there had been relatively modest of late. Worries are arising, in fact, that housing prices in both places\u2014 whether for renters or buyers \u2014 are destined to price out all but the most affluent in the coming years.\n\nThe same trend, critics note, has long been evident in such high-tech centers as San Francisco, San Jose, California, and Seattle, where Amazon is based. In those cities, low- and moderate-income families increasingly struggle to afford housing anywhere near their workplaces.\n\nOut of concern that Amazon's arrival could make homes prohibitively expensive, buyers around Crystal City are suddenly rushing to close on sales, said Brian MacMahon, a real estate agent with Redfin in Northern Virginia.\n\nEnvisioning a stream of rising rental income, investors are calling from as far as California to inquire about buying homes they could rent out or just let appreciate in value, MacMahon said. Two sellers have just pulled listings from the market, he said, so the homes could be re-listed next year, presumably at higher prices, after the market adjusts to Amazon's arrival.\n\n\"When we have nice stuff coming onto the market, it's flying off the shelf,\" MacMahon said.\n\nBy choosing the New York and Washington areas, Amazon has inadvertently thrown a spotlight on the gulf between a small group of thriving but high-cost U.S. cities and the rest of the country. Housing in Amazon's two new hubs are well more than twice the median home price nationwide of $255,000, according to ATTOM Data Solutions.\n\nThe median price in Arlington County has surged 12.5 percent so far this year to $585,000. In Queens County, the median has risen 7 percent to $630,000.\n\nAmazon executives were drawn to the sizable pools of well-educated and skilled workers in the two areas, which they chose over 18 other finalists with housing that has generally been less expensive.\n\n\"Home affordability was not a prime deciding factor for Amazon,\" said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president of ATTOM.\n\nIn some ways, Amazon had injected adrenaline into a New York City market where price growth had exceeded wage gains to the point that sales had begun to slow. Until last weekend, real estate agents say, attendance at open houses for condos in Long Island City had been sparse.\n\nThe $1.7 million condo at the Foundry building, with its private terrace and skyscraper views, was once the kind of showcase property that triggered competing bids within a few weeks. Buyers, though, had adopted a wait-and-see stance as mortgage rates rose, luxury construction flooded the market and interest from foreign buyers waned.\n\nYet over the weekend, open house attendance in Long Island City suddenly tripled as word of Amazon's announcement became public, said Christopher Austad, a real estate broker with Douglas Elliman.\n\n\"We just caught a huge breath of fresh air \u2014 it's like someone just resuscitated us,\" Austad said. \"I've had a dozen new buyers and investors reach out this week. I've had past sellers contracting me and saying, 'Chris, we want to invest in LIC.' It's great.\"\n\nIn the Seattle area, Amazon's presence, along with that of other tech giants like Microsoft, is thought to have contributed to home values that have priced out even relatively affluent families and have left poorer residents with few options. Homelessness has worsened. Over the past five years, the median home value in Seattle has rocketed 73 percent to $739,600, according to an analysis by the real estate firm Zillow, which is also based there.\n\nPartly in response, the city approved a series of increases to its minimum wage that will reach as high as $16 an hour next year. It approved a corporate tax this year to help the homeless, though the tax was repealed after being challenged by the business community, including Amazon.\n\nAaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow, said he thinks metro New York and Washington will avoid the same predicament.\n\n\"I don't think we should expect a similar jump,\" Terrazas said. \"Both New York and D.C. have demonstrated a capacity to add supply in ways that Seattle was reluctant to.\"\n\nBoth metro areas are already comfortable with building blocks of apartment and condo towers, he said. Their high-density construction makes it easier to accommodate the job growth than cities that prioritize single-family housing.\n\nThey also contain extensive mass transit networks. In theory at least, the New York and Washington subway systems can ease housing price pressures by enabling workers to spread out.\n\nStill, the benefits of mass transit depend on New York and Washington maintaining and improving their systems \u2014 a severe challenge in recent years amid breakdowns, deteriorating tracks and rising expenses in both transportation systems.\n\nYet the underlying message from Amazon's two selections is that big tech companies seem not to view housing costs as a barrier for hiring workers. Companies in Seattle and San Francisco have increasingly expressed concern that tech talent there would migrate to Salt Lake City, Boise or other cities where homes are more affordable.\n\nAmazon appears less concerned.\n\n\"There was anxiety in Silicon Valley that there are all these up-and-coming tech hubs that would challenge them,\" Terrazas said. \"What the selection of D.C. and New York underlines is how the dominant players continue to be dominant.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Cheyenne Haslett", "title": "As emergency court hearing looms, White House defends revoking CNN reporter's pass", "description": "The White House argued taking away CNN's chief White House correspondent's credentials did not violate the First Amendment.

The West Wing is a tight, small space, he argued, which is why journalists want to be there.\n\nCNN and Acosta filed suit against President Donald Trump and top aides on Tuesday for stripping Acosta, without warning, of his access to the White House, where he works daily. The indefinite revocation of Acosta\u2019s press credentials, known as a \u201chard pass,\u201d came on the heels of a heated exchange between Trump and Acosta on Nov. 7.\n\nCNN and Acosta filed an emergency motion to have Acosta\u2019s press pass immediately reinstated as the court case continues and asked for a ruling from Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly in federal court in Washington Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters, FILE\n\nOn Wednesday, the judge pushed CNN\u2019s lawyers on how they can prove that Acosta's press pass was revoked specifically because of the content of Acosta\u2019s reporting rather than based on his behavior, which the president described as \"rude.\" CNN's case relies heavily on Sherrill v. Knight, a 1971 case which established that taking away a journalist's press pass because of the content of their coverage is prohibited under the First Amendment.\n\nDespite months of criticism launched at CNN and Acosta, \u201cUntil this point, [the administration] took no action,\u201d U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly said in a question to CNN\u2019s lawyer, Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr. \u201cWhat triggered a content-based response here as opposed to all those other months?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a bad day for the president,\u201d Boutrous said. \u201cIt was the day after the midterms.\u201d\n\nBoutrous said the issue was bigger than Acosta or CNN.\n\n\u201cRudeness really is a code word for \u2018I don\u2019t like you being an aggressive reporter,\u2019\u201d he said, which threatens the right of journalists to ask tenacious questions and, he argued, will have a \"chilling effect\" on the White House press corps.\n\nIt's Trump who \u201cestablishes the tenor and tone of these press conferences,\u201d Boutrous argued, and \"wants it to be a free-for-all, that's his prerogative.\"\n\n\"He is the most aggressive, dare I say rude, person in the room, and I\u2019m not being critical -- this is the rough and tumble of the presidency, and that\u2019s what the First Amendment protects,\u201d Boutrous said.\n\nThe defense argued that denying Acosta a press pass was not a violation of the First Amendment as there is no guaranteed access to the White House, and dozens of other CNN reporters with \"hard passes\" could continue to serve public interest by reporting on the White House grounds. Acosta could continue to do his job by watching video fed back from the White House, the defense argued.\n\nBoutrous called their argument a \"fundamental misconception of journalism.\"\n\n\"Different reporters break different stories. This notion that it's some minor thing to be in the White House, be at a gaggle ... to work your sources in the White House, to go talk to the government officials who are there, that is invaluable access. We have evidence, they have no evidence,\" Boutrous said, also arguing that the president can't decide who CNN sends to the White House or exercise control over who the network wants to be its chief White House correspondent.\n\n\"There's no First Amendment doctrine that, if there are a bunch of other reporters, you can bar someone else and it's not a violation,\" Boutrous said, but Sherrill v. Knight, the lawyer argued, established the opposite.\n\n\"There's an interest to ensure that no one reporter is excluded -- and it's the public's interest,\" Boutrous said. \"Maybe that's the reporter who would break the story, who would break the story wide open because of their sources.\"\n\nThe judge also asked whether the White House could act differently to reprimand Acosta without taking away his pass in full \u2014 something like not allowing Acosta in briefings with the president but letting him on White House grounds.\n\nBoutrous said that suggestion would still be a violation of First Amendment rights.\n\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nIn a brief written before the court hearing Wednesday, lawyers arguing on behalf of the president laid out the defense strategy and maintained that Acosta\u2019s credentials were taken away because he \u201cdisrupted the fair and orderly administration of a press conference during an exchange with the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Acosta\u2019s decision to engage in conduct that disrupts press events and impedes other reporters from asking questions provides a more-than-sufficient reason for revoking his hard pass,\u201d the president\u2019s attorneys wrote.\n\nThe brief focused largely on Acosta\u2019s \u201cdisrupt[tions]\u201d during the press conference rather than a previous explanation by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, which CNN promptly denied, that Acosta had placed his hands on an intern who tried to take away his microphone. The judge declined to characterize it as a \"shift\" in narrative.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nIn the brief, Trump\u2019s attorneys argued it would be \u201cextraordinary\u201d for the court to decide to \u201cdirectly police access to the secure White House complex where the president lives and works, as well as to dictate who the President must invite to press events.\u201d\n\nMany individual journalists who attended the press conference have shared personal accounts and spoken out, defending Acosta. Major news outlets also joined together to issue a statement in support of Acosta and CNN Tuesday, and filed \"friend of the court\" briefs in the case.\n\n\u201cWhether the news of the day concerns national security, the economy, or the environment, reporters covering the White House must remain free to ask questions. It is imperative that independent journalists have access to the President and his activities, and that journalists are not barred for arbitrary reasons,\u201d read a statement issued by The Associated Press, NBC News, FOX News, POLITICO, The New York Times, The Washington Post and more.\n\n\u201cOur news organizations support the fundamental constitutional right to question this President, or any President. We will be filing friend-of-the-court briefs to support CNN\u2019s and Jim Acosta\u2019s lawsuit based on these principles,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nThe statement echoed one from the White House Correspondents' Association, which criticized the Trump White House decision and supported CNN.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who is on a tour of Asia, was asked about Acosta and press freedom after he criticized Myanmar's lack of freedom during the trip.\n\n\"This administration has stood strong for a free and independent press and defended the freedom of the press on a world stage,\" Pence told reporters in Singapore. \"There's no comparison whatsoever between disagreements over decorum at the White House and the imprisonment of the two reporters in Myanmar.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Traders react, gold leaf applied and Michelle Obama: World in Photos, Nov. 14", "description": "Here's a look at the top photos from around the globe.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/traders-react-gold-leaf-applied-michelle-obama-world-59198289", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/181114_world_photos_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:38:27Z", "content": "Now Playing: WWI armistice centennial, wildfires, clashes in Spain: World in Photos Now Playing: Wildfires rage, Stan Lee's Hollywood star and Emirati dancers: World in Photos Now Playing: Traders react, gold leaf applied and Michelle Obama: World in Photos, \u2026 [+969 chars]", "fulltext": "Now Playing: WWI armistice centennial, wildfires, clashes in Spain: World in Photos\n\nNow Playing: Wildfires rage, Stan Lee's Hollywood star and Emirati dancers: World in Photos\n\nNow Playing: Surveillance video shows gunmen near Karachi's Chinese consulate\n\nNow Playing: London police ram mopeds to tackle bike crime\n\nNow Playing: Greek court convicts 6 men in the death of a US tourist\n\nNow Playing: Man spends 12 hours sitting on capsized boat off Australian coast\n\nNow Playing: Slain US missionary's 'desire was to befriend' tribespeople\n\nNow Playing: New Guinea performers, Florida recount, turkey pardons: World in Photos, Nov. 22\n\nNow Playing: Meghan Markle's journey from Hollywood actress to British royalty\n\nNow Playing: US missionary killed by remote tribe off the coast of India\n\nNow Playing: American killed by tribesman knew island was off limits\n\nNow Playing: Meghan Markle's royal visit\n\nNow Playing: American believed to have been killed by isolated tribe in India: Reports\n\nNow Playing: A turkey's press conference, wildfire battle, rebels rest: World in Photos\n\nNow Playing: Police help cat locked out of Prime Minister Theresa May's office\n\nNow Playing: 1st look at new documentary about Meghan Markle's new royal life\n\nNow Playing: Trump's statement of support for Saudi Crown Prince suspected in journalist's death\n\nNow Playing: Woman who fell to her death on cruise did not want to go: Family\n\nNow Playing: Trump defends US-Saudi Arabia bond amid Khashoggi updates"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Traffic sham: Cops pull over cardboard 'bus' on Russian bridge - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Traffic sham: Cops pull over cardboard 'bus' on Russian bridge ABC News The wheels on the bus go not so fast.

Most people recover within four to seven days without treatment. Sometimes the illness can be so severe that people need to be hospitalized; this could be for severe diarrhea leading to dehydration, or if the infection spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream and other places in the body. People at higher risk for severe illness are children under the age of 5, adults over the age of 65 and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nThe strain of salmonella causing the outbreak has been found in samples from live turkeys, raw turkey products and turkey pet food in Minnesota, the CDC said. It has also been identified in samples of raw turkey products from slaughterhouses and meat processors.\n\n\"The salmonella strain isolated from these samples is closely related genetically to the salmonella strain from ill people,\" the CDC said.\n\nThe CDC is not advising consumers to avoid eating properly cooked turkey products or that retailers stop selling raw turkey products. It recommends handling raw turkey carefully, including washing your hands before and after preparing or eating turkey. Counters, cutting boards and utensils should also be thoroughly washed to prevent the spreading of germs from raw turkey to food preparation areas. Cooking raw turkey thoroughly (to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F, measured by placing a thermometer in the thickest part of the food) will help prevent food poisoning. Feeding raw meat to pets is also discouraged.\n\nJohanna Kreafle, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Browns interim coach Williams to get shot at full-time gig - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Browns interim coach Williams to get shot at full-time gig ABC News As John Dorsey prepares to make a critical decision he knows may shape Cleveland's football fortunes, the Browns general manager spends a moment every day giving himself a pep talk. \u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/browns-interim-coach-williams-shot-full-time-gig-59191773", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Sports/WireAP_6d1e828ee8904f1da48d2a2626e60006_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:26:00Z", "content": "As John Dorsey prepares to make a critical decision he knows may shape Cleveland's football fortunes, the Browns general manager spends a moment every day giving himself a pep talk.

Dorsey has been impressed with the job that Williams, the team's fiery defensive coordinator, has done over the past two weeks since taking over for Hue Jackson, who was fired on Oct. 29 after going just 3-36-1 in two-plus seasons.\n\nThe Browns beat Atlanta 28-16 on Sunday and have split their two games under the 60-year-old Williams, who Dorsey feels he has provided more than stability.\n\n\"I've always been a believer of you play the game like you practice and I think these practices have been very competitive,\" Dorsey said. \"They've been very structured, they've been very disciplined, and guys have had some energy and that's the difference I see. There's been a focus on the little things which I think is important.\"\n\nWilliams has previous head coaching experience with Buffalo from 2001-2003. He was also the defensive coordinator in New Orleans from 2009-2011, when he guided a group that won the Super Bowl but was also embroiled in the \"Bountygate\" scandal that resulted in him being suspended by the NFL for one season.\n\nBesides Williams, Dorsey has been pleased with how Cleveland's offense has played under running backs coach Freddie Kitchens, who took over play-calling duties when coordinator Todd Haley was fired the same day as Jackson. Dorsey would not speculate on Kitchens' future with the team, but said he \"has done a heck of a job.\"\n\nDorsey would not divulge who else in upper Cleveland's management team will help him find a coach, but he was adamant the Browns will not hire an outside firm to assist, which is something owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam have done in the past.\n\n\"We don't need that,\" he snapped.\n\nDorsey was tight-lipped on other aspects of the search, including whether he would be willing to hire a college coach with no pro experience. However, he did outline the traits he's seeking in a new coach.\n\n\"For me personally, I would like to see a man of character,\" he said. \"I would like to see a man who can lead young men. I would like a man who has high acumen. Those are the three basic things there I'm looking for.\"\n\nDorsey promised to be as publicly quiet about the search as he was earlier this year when he kept Cleveland's No. 1 draft pick a well-guarded secret before choosing quarterback Baker Mayfield.\n\nThat selection is part of why Dorsey feels Cleveland's coaching gig is so appealing. Mayfield is showing signs of growth and along with rookie running back Nick Chubb, defensive end Myles Garrett, wide receiver Jarvis Landry and others, the Browns have a talented core of young players. The Browns also have nearly $60 million in salary cap space, a rabid fan base, 11 draft picks in 2019 and committed owners fixated on winning.\n\n\"Those are exciting things for this organization moving forward,\" he said. \"Anybody, once they understand that, you will see that, you know what? Cleveland is a good place to be.\"\n\nNOTES: Dorsey had little to say about Jackson returning to Cincinnati as a special assistant to Bengals coach Marvin Lewis. \"I wish him the best,\" he said. \"It was hard a couple of weeks ago.\" ... Dorsey would not say if he intends to interview former Arizona coach Bruce Arians, who is retired and doing TV analysis but has expressed interest in Cleveland's opening. \"I have a lot of respect for coach Arians,\" Dorsey said. \"Right now, we are in the process of beginning to finalize our plan. If it comes to the appropriate time and if he happens to be one of the people, you will find out.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014NFL"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Sister of Burger Chef murder victim calls for justice", "description": "Theresa Jefferies told reporters Wednesday that her sister Ruth Shelton and the other victims were \"real people.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/sister-burger-chef-murder-victim-calls-justice-59195825", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181114_vod_orig_burgerMIX_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:25:31Z", "content": "Now Playing: Urgent manhunt underway for Tennessee man wanted for 2 murders Now Playing: Meet the small town mom whose love for quilting changed her life and her community Now Playing: Ballet dancer vanishes, car found abandoned Now Playing: Sister of Burger \u2026 [+1164 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Sister of Burger Chef murder victim calls for justice\n\nI guess why I'm here is not to talk about an investigation.

She\u2019d been sober for nine years when she and her husband, Ben, decided to have a baby. Motherhood was something she wanted to feel.\n\nIf she needed an epidural during labor, Veum told her doctor, she didn\u2019t want any fentanyl in it. She didn\u2019t want to feel high.\n\nAdam Grossberg/KQED\n\n\u201cI remembered seeing other friends,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019d used it, and they were feeling good and stuff. I didn\u2019t want that to be a part of my story.\u201d\n\nAn epidural is a form of regional anesthesia given via an injection of drugs into the space around the spinal cord. It is typically a mix of two types of medication: a numbing agent, usually from the lidocaine family, and a painkiller, usually fentanyl.\n\nThe amount of fentanyl in the mix is limited, and little passes into the bloodstream, anesthesiologists say. But if a woman doesn\u2019t want the fentanyl, it\u2019s easy to formulate an epidural solution without it. Doctors either use a substitute medication or boost the concentration of the numbing agent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no medical reason why someone should be forced to be exposed to opioids if they don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Dr. Kelly Pfeifer, a family physician and addiction expert who now works as director of high-value care at the California Health Care Foundation. (Kaiser Health News produces California Healthline, an editorially independent publication of the California Health Care Foundation.)\n\nPfeifer said there\u2019s another situation to be aware of: pregnant women who are taking methadone or suboxone to manage opioid addiction. During labor, anesthesiologists often prescribe narcotics to help manage pain, but some of those commonly used \u2014 like Nubain \u2014 can immediately reverse the effects of methadone or suboxone.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, you\u2019re in the middle of labor \u2014 which is already painful \u2014 and now you\u2019re in the middle of the worst withdrawal of your life,\u201d Pfeifer said.\n\nFor Veum, one of the worst wildfires in California\u2019s recorded history is what interrupted her birth plan. She and her husband live in Santa Rosa, Calif., and she was in active labor when devastating fires ignited nearby on Oct. 8, 2017. What are now known as the \u201cWine Country Wildfires\u201d burned more than 5,000 homes and killed 44 people.\n\n\u201cThere was a ton of smoke in the hospital,\u201d Veum said. \u201cLike you could visibly see it outside \u2014 and smell it.\u201d\n\nNurses told her everybody had to evacuate. Veum was transferred to another hospital, 5 miles away. And the special instructions for her epidural got lost in the chaos.\n\n\u201cThen, when they went to change the drug, I saw the tube said \u2018Fentanyl\u2019 on it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd by that point I was starting to feel \u2018the itchies'\u201d \u2014 one of the familiar physical signs she would experience when starting to get high.\n\nMost women without a history of addiction wouldn\u2019t experience these sensations when given opioid anesthesia, said Dr. Jennifer Lucero, chief of obstetric anesthesiology at the University of California-San Francisco Medical Center. Anytime a woman who is not in recovery asks for an epidural without fentanyl (usually out of the mom\u2019s concern for the baby), Lucero explains why it\u2019s there.\n\nThe fentanyl allows the anesthesiologist to balance out the numbing agent in the solution, she said, so women don\u2019t have as much pain from the contractions but can still feel the pressure and are able to move their legs a bit or shift in bed during labor.\n\nOnce she explains the trade-offs, and assures women that the opioid will have no effect on their fetus, most of her patients opt to keep fentanyl in the epidural solution.\n\nBut doctors have been trying to cut down on administering opioids in other ways during labor and delivery, namely in what they prescribe for pain after the birth.\n\nFor years, women who had a normal, vaginal birth were sent home with a 30-day supply of Norco, Percocet or another opioid, Lucero said.\n\n\u201cSome people would think they\u2019re supposed to take them all,\u201d Lucero said, while other women \u201cwould not use it, and it would just be sitting in the bathroom cabinet.\u201d\n\nWhile most people who get a bottle of pills when leaving the hospital won\u2019t develop dependence or an addiction, some will. When a patient is prescribed opioids for short-term pain, the risk of chronic use starts to increase as early as the third day of the prescription, according to a report published last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A study out this year suggests that every week of opioid use increases the risk of misuse.\n\nAs recently as 2017, postpartum women were routinely being prescribed three- to five-day supplies of opioids \u2014 even after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. A study published that year of 164,720 Pennsylvania women on Medicaid who gave birth vaginally found that 12 percent of them filled an opioid prescription after they gave birth \u2014 even though most did not have a clear medical need for a painkiller, such as vaginal tearing or an episiotomy.\n\nNow obstetricians are issuing new guidelines to patients, Lucero said, and they\u2019re trying to prescribe limited amounts of opioids, and only post-surgically, to women who have had a cesarean section.\n\nNicole Veum ended up being one of those women. After she was transferred to the second hospital during the wildfire evacuation, she spent another 12 hours in the early stages of labor, but she wasn\u2019t progressing. She agreed to a C-section.\n\nAdam Grossberg/KQED\n\nAfter the birth of her son, doctors sent her home with a bottle of Percocet \u2014 another opioid. They told her that if she was worried about being able to maintain her sobriety, she could have her husband or a friend hold on to the bottle and control the dosage.\n\nPfeifer, the physician and addiction specialist, said that in a situation like that, sending Veum home with just a few Percocet pills, or even suggesting she take only ibuprofen, would have been fine.\n\n\u201cAny parent will tell you there\u2019s nothing more stressful than the first week of being a parent and having a baby and being in sleep deprivation,\u201d Pfeifer said. \u201cAnd here you have a little bottle of Vicodin that you used to turn to, to make you feel better when you\u2019re stressed.\u201d\n\nFirst the fires. Then the fentanyl in her epidural. Then the Percocet. It was Veum\u2019s first test in seeing how her sobriety and motherhood would line up. She called a friend who was also in recovery. They talked it all through, and Veum was fine.\n\n\u201cI was OK. I was OK with it. It was just something that happened,\u201d she said as her baby, Adrian, now a year old, plays with a new toy.\n\nVeum is 32 now. She\u2019s returned to school this fall to work toward her college degree, after a 14-year break. And she is loving being a mom.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, metaphorically, felt it as a baby coming out of the ash \u2014 the life coming from the ashes,\u201d she said about her child born in the midst of the 2017 wildfires.\n\n\u201cAnd I feel that,\u201d Veum said. \u201cI feel like it was a big time for our community \u2014 and me personally \u2014 to be reborn in some way.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of a partnership that includes KQED, NPR and Kaiser Health News.\n\nKHN\u2019s coverage of women\u2019s health care issues is supported in part by The David and Lucile Packard Foundation.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

The Judiciary Committee took up the question of whether a president should be impeached and the only witness today. Was mr. Starr who began with a lengthy statement on what his investigation. Had conclude are first we go to Washington and ABC's Jackie Judd. Oh and Kenneth Starr as witness for the prosecution calmly and methodically laid out his case against the president. The key point about the president's. Conduct is this. On at least six different occasions. From December 171997. Through August 171998. The president had to make a decision. He could choose truth. Or he could choose deception. On all six occasions. The president chose deception. The. First decision says Starr came when mr. Clinton called Lewinsky at her Watergate apartment in the middle of the night. To tell her she would be a witness in the Paula Jones case. The president could have told ms. Lewinsky that they must tell the truth. Under oath. The president could have explained. That they might face embarrassment. But bat as a citizen. And as the president he could not lying under oath. And he could not sit by while Monica did so. The president. Did not say anything like that. Instead that Starr Lewinsky claimed they discussed cover story devised longer ago. At that moment. The president's answer month relationship. With a subordinate employee. Was transformed. It was transformed into an unlawful effort. To thwart the judicial process. Star said the president soon made another critical decision. To make a series of allegedly false statement when deposed by jones' lawyers. He testified that he could not were called being alone with ms. Lewinsky that was untrue. He testified that he could not recall ever being in the Oval Office hallway with miss Lewinsky except perhaps when she was delivering pizza. That was untrue he testified that he could not rule called gifts exchanged between ms. Lewinsky and him that was untrue. He testified. After a 142. Pause. That he was not sure whether he'd ever talked to ms. Lewinsky about the possibility. That she might be asked to testify. In the lawsuit. That was untrue. By contrast Starr's account of mr. Clinton's lengthy testimony before the grand jury was brief and without any graphic detail. The president thus denied certain con top conduct with ms. Lewinsky. And devised a variety of tortured and false. Definitions. But Starr defended having asked mr. Clinton for sexual details of his affair with Lewinsky. And for including them in his referral to congress the details. Of the president's relationship with ms. Lewinsky. Became relevant. Indeed. They became critical. In determining rather. And the extent to which the president made false statements under road. And otherwise obstructed just justice. Democrats objected when star went beyond the Lewinsky case. I believe mr. Starr's remarks are now out of order but he actually exonerated by a resident in a number of areas. All he testified mr. Clinton was not involved in firing White House Travel Office employees. Or in the collection of FBI files by two White House aides. And star revealed that last year he drafted a referral to congress. About mr. Clinton's alleged involvement in a fraudulent loan given to Susan McDougal but then decided the evidence was not strong enough. And at the end of this testimony with his voice rising star made a final her sense of his own conduct. I Revere. The law. I'm proud of what we have accomplished. We were assigned the difficult job. We have done Ent to the best of our abilities. We've tried to be both fair. And power. Clearly the independent counsel had a huge challenge going into this hearing to reshape his public image and to restore credibility to as much maligned investigation. But at least for a couple of hours today Ken Starr got to focus on what he says is the real issue. The evidence against the president.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Theresa May announces agreement on Brexit", "description": "The British prime minister said she believes with her \"head\" and \"heart\" that it is in the best interest of the United Kingdom.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/theresa-announces-agreement-brexit-59197121", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/181114_vod_orig_may_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:05:16Z", "content": "Now Playing: British prime minister says Brexit negotiations 'at an impasse' Now Playing: Understanding Britain's Brexit Battle Now Playing: UK prime minister on Brexit: 'It will happen' Now Playing: Theresa May announces agreement on Brexit Now Playing: Isra\u2026 [+1003 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Theresa May announces agreement on Brexit\n\nThe cabinet is just those long days eldest impassioned debate.

The unorthodox move inspired a scene in the 1986 Clint Eastwood film \"Heartbreak Ridge,\" where the Hollywood star similarly used a bulldozer to advance on a Cuban position.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\n\nAbizaid is unique among high-ranking military officials for his intimate knowledge of the Arab world. The grandson of Lebanese-Christian immigrants, Abizaid is fluent in Arabic and obtained a master\u2019s degree from Harvard University in Middle Eastern area studies.\n\nMany considered his passion for the Arab world to be an asset during the early years of the Iraq War, when Abizaid oversaw the effort as CENTCOM commander. Now, if confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Abizaid will be tested in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nQuestions linger over the possible involvement of Saudi officials in the killing of Khashoggi, including de facto ruler Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has emphasized that the United States will hold all of those involved accountable, and pressed Saudi Arabia to do the same.\n\nThe Trump administration recently announced it would stop midair refueling of Saudi military flights to Yemen, and the State Department announced 21 Saudi \u201csuspects\u201d would have their U.S. visas revoked, or be deemed ineligible for a U.S. visa.\n\nCongress has also triggered an executive branch investigation into whether Saudi Arabia should face Global Magnitsky Act sanctions for human rights violations.\n\nThe appointment of a four-star general like Abizaid underscores how much the Trump administration values its military relationship with Saudi Arabia. President Donald Trump went to Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip, and touted a $110 billion arms deal with the kingdom.\n\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe $110 billion figure represents offers of intent or interest, according to Bruce Riedel, director of the Brookings Intelligence Project and a former CIA officer. He described the deal as a \u201cwish list\u201d of what the U.S. would like to sell Saudi Arabia in the next four to five years, but it is not guaranteed that all the deals will come to fruition. Saudi Arabia has purchased $14.5 billion in arms so far.\n\nThe arms sales have been a focal point of Trump\u2019s deliberations on whether, and how much, to punish Saudi Arabia for the killing of Khashoggi.\n\n\"I don't want to lose all of that investment being made into our country. I don't want to lose a million jobs, I don't want to lose $110 billion dollars in terms of investment,\" Trump told reporters in October.\n\nAnother question looming over Abizaid\u2019s nomination is whether Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, will maintain his close relationship with Saudi officials, and whether Kushner will hinder Abizaid\u2019s ability to conduct diplomacy.\n\nSaudi Royal Palace/Bandar Al-Jaloud/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe ambassador post has remained vacant for nearly two years of the Trump administration, but Kushner has a close relationship with the prince and has made multiple trips to Saudi Arabia.\n\nKushner clashed with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson over a Saudi campaign to blockade Qatar, as the Gulf states accused Qatar of harboring terrorists. Kushner sided with the Saudis, while Tillerson attempted to defend Qatar, which hosts an enormous U.S. air base."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump nominates retired four-star general to be Saudi ambassador - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Trump nominates retired four-star general to be Saudi ambassador ABC News The Trump administration has nominated John Abizaid, the former head of U.S. Central Command, to be ambassador to Saudi Arabia.

That campaign targeted the Muslim-majority ethnic group in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state, as well as other ethnic minorities in the area, and killed thousands. The U.N. has said it should be investigated as a genocide, but the U.S. has stopped short of that and called it ethnic cleansing.\n\n\"The violence and persecution by military and vigilantes that resulted in driving 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh is without excuse,\" Pence told Suu Kyi on the sidelines of ASEAN, a major regional summit, in Singapore. He added that he was anxious to hear about progress in resolving the crisis and holding people accountable.\n\nWhile the U.S. has also warned that \"conditions in Burma,\" another name for Myanmar, \"are not yet conducive for returns,\" Pence did not vocalize that concern on Wednesday. He said instead, \"We are anxious to hear about the progress in making it possible for the Rohingya to voluntarily come home.\"\n\nBut those repatriations are not \"voluntary, safe, and dignified,\" according to the State Department, U.N., and aid groups.\n\nMohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters\n\nLast week, 42 humanitarian and civil society organizations that work in Myanmar and Bangladesh said Rohingya refugees in camps in Cox's Bazaar, Bangladesh, \"are terrified about what will happen to them if they are returned to Myanmar now and distressed by the lack of information they have received.\"\n\nWhile many Rohingya want to return home, they said, they fear doing so without protections like citizenship and those responsible for the slaughter being held accountable.\n\nAfter the meeting, senior U.S. administration officials said Pence and Suu Kyi had discussed the importance of having Rohingya return home, but only on a voluntary basis, with safety and dignity, according to the Associated Press.\n\nSuu Kyi is the head of Myanmar's civilian government and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who suffered for years as a democratic activist and political prisoner under house arrest when Myanmar was ruled by a military junta. She and her party came to power in 2012 as part of a power-sharing government with the military, but her defense of Myanmar's campaign against the Rohingya has tarnished her name on the world stage, with Amnesty International rescinding its highest honor given to her in 2009 on Monday.\n\nAs she has, she again defended Myanmar in the face of Pence's stern words: \"We understand our country better than any other country does.

The opening arguments had to be delayed because two of the anonymous jurors. Already had to be replaced with Johnson is at the courthouse in Brooklyn whit what happened with these jurors. Well Diane as you mentioned really dramatic start before those opening statements even began this is been a long process with jurors complaining worried about their security. Their safety and also the time that this trial's guilt going to take expected to last up to four months. I'm gonna get into that just second to wanna deal lay of the land here is you can see this street by paper of the courthouse. Pretty much empty media tripod and cameras as a lot of the journalists have rushed inside for those opening statements to get back underway again today the unprecedented security this street blocked off Pierson no cars are able to pass their front of the building. But as you mentioned those two jurors really came as a surprise for those who were in the courtroom one juror actually delivered a hand written note to the judge expressing that she she had problems with anxiety. And medical issues had a note from a doctor in the judge fearing that this juror could actually break down crying. During the trial. Decided to go ahead and dismiss her a second juror who is self employed express financial concerns and said that he simply couldn't manage that the months long trial it would be too much or financial burden to. To him and is spam whites so those jurors were dismissed. And replace the opening statements yesterday morning got under way. Guzman is facing seventeen counts including drug trafficking murder. Kidnapping he's accused of a more than almost three dozen murders and a variety of different crimes the prosecution pinning him to be this this. This drug kingpin who for decades she. Murdered and slaughtered those were his competitors anything that got in his way. Described event as being important reedy and and and was able to come up with billions of dollars through this through through his elaborate to drugs deals over the years. Had a diamond encrusted pistol gold plated AK forty sevens so there is this this myth of el chapo Guzman that was created and that is something that the defense is actually trying to fight against saying that this is all basically. A hit job from the governments of US and Mexico winds actually putting the blame on his deputy that he was the real man in charge who's running things. While I Guzman was actually on the run and escaping from two prisons. And I will be interesting to see if that defense works the prosecution is trying to argue they shouldn't even be able to say that. So they're already off to quite the dramatic start on several levels with. But I in terms of safety and security and they're just seem to be so many concerns surrounding that in this trial not only. Those I'll chop O have a history of breaking out of maximum security prisons. But I know you know in terms of the jury people might be wondering why it been so difficult to retain the jurors but their own security is one of the big concerns as well. Well you can imagine what they are keeping the jurors' names anonymous and all of this and planned. Keep it that way after the trial is overby you can imagine what this man Guzman is accused of years and years that prosecution is is. Pinning its almost three dozen homicides on him that he was connected to they say. So there is their fear is a real issue with the jury answered those jurors are being escorted to and from the courthouse by US marshals every single day there's extra security also for any of the witnesses who may be called in this facility is actually. Receiving its its. Unprecedented level security it's the most security on a daily basis at this courthouse. In the history. Of the buildings even imagine what's going on here everything cut off there's also all. A lot that we don't know about el chapo Guzman and actually where he's been housed as the trial is taking place we know that he was in maximum security facility in Manhattan. In solitary confinement for a period of time but what is happening now and where exactly he is during the trial because they don't want to shut down the Brooklyn Bridge every single time he's passing back and forth. So there's a lot of unknowns about. How this is all playing out right now but security a top priority in you can imagine why.

He takes office Jan. 1.\n\nCuba made the announcement after Bolsonaro said the program overseen by the World Health Organization could only continue if doctors directly received their salaries from Brazil, and were able to bring their families with them during their assignments, among other conditions.\n\nThe Cuban government generally keeps most of the salaries of state employees working abroad as part of the socialist state's \"international missions.\" Participants also are generally barred from bringing family members in a measure that critics say is designed to prevent doctors from emigrating.\n\n\"Mas Medicos\" started five years ago under leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Cuba said roughly 20,000 doctors saw millions of patients in areas such as the Amazon rainforest and slums of major cities.\n\nCuba maintains similar missions in 67 other countries but \"Mas Medicos\" was one of the largest and most important, serving as a link between the cash-strapped island and South America's largest economy.\n\n\"Cubans have provided a valuable service to the Brazilian people with dignity, deep sensitivity, professionality, dedication and altruism,\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. \"Such humane acts should be respected and defended.\"\n\nAll Cuban doctors work for the state and virtually all receive salaries that are well below $100 a month. Doctors are not permitted to leave Cuba without government permission, a control that was lifted for virtually all other Cubans five years ago.\n\nThousands of Cuban doctors work in the island's public health-care system, which suffers from crumbling infrastructure but still provides free and universal health care to all citizens. Thousands of other Cuban doctors go abroad each year and generate billions of dollars for the state, one of Cuba's most important sources of foreign exchange.\n\nThe doctors generally receive a fraction of the salary paid to the Cuban government. But even that fraction far exceeds the salaries of doctors working in Cuba. That drives many doctors to complete foreign missions in order to earn cash for important expenses like home repairs, appliances or a motor vehicle.\n\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Health said there were 8,332 Cuban doctors in Brazil, each costing the country roughly $3,100 a month, plus room and board.\n\nBolsonaro said Brazil would offer asylum to Cuban doctors who wished to stay in Brazil.\n\n\"This is slave labor,\" he said. \"I couldn't be an accomplice of that.\"\n\nNeither side said exactly when the Cuban doctors would be leaving but their departure comes at a bad time for Cuba, which is facing its third year of slow growth, expected to be around 1 percent this year. Productivity is low in virtually every state-run industry, tourism has slowed under the Trump administration and Venezuela, a key ally, has cut back on subsidized oil and other aid.\n\nNonetheless, Bolsonaro's conditions were out of the question for Cuba.\n\n\"It's not acceptable to question the dignity, professionalism and altruism of Cubans who, with the support of their families, provide services in 67 countries,\" the Cuban health ministry said in a statement. \"The Brazilian people will understand who bears the responsibility for the fact that our doctors can't keep providing their support and solidarity in that nation.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDe Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Leaders of Djibouti and Eritrea, which also had a turbulent relationship after multiple border clashes, met with the help of Ethiopia, though there has been no breakthrough.\n\nAhmed's office said after the vote that the lifting of sanctions will have far-reaching effects in improving stability and building lasting peace and normal relations in the Horn of Africa region.\n\n\"It will further enhance the collaborative gains that have been achieved in the region over the past few months,\" the Ethiopian prime minister's office said.\n\nEritrea, a former Italian colony, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year guerrilla war. It had a decades-long border dispute with Ethiopia, including a war from 1998-2000 in which about 80,000 people died.\n\nThe Security Council imposed an arms embargo and other tough sanctions on Eritrea in 2009 for supplying weapons to Somalia's Islamic extremist al-Shabab rebels, who are opposed to the Somali government, and for refusing to resolve a border dispute with Djibouti, a key U.S. ally in the Horn of Africa.\n\nEritrea's Charge d'Affaires Amanuel Giorgio called the sanctions \"unwarranted punitive measures\" and told the council after the vote that \"the long overdue call for justice is finally answered.\"\n\nHe congratulated the people of Eritrea \"on this historic day,\" and stressed that \"Eritreans are extremely joyous and full of pride to have witnessed the recent positive regional developments ... (that) mark the beginning of a new dawn.\"\n\n\"While proud of the region's capability to resolve intransigent conflicts at unprecedented speed, we are not complacent,\" Giorgio said. \"Eritrea recognizes that a more difficult and complex task is waiting ahead. It is determined to redouble its own efforts and work closely with its neighbors to build a region at peace with itself.\"\n\nThe resolution immediately lifts \"the arms embargoes, travel bans, asset freezes and targeted sanctions imposed on Eritrea by the Security Council.\"\n\nBut the Netherlands' ambassador, Karel van Oosterom, stressed that other demands by the council including that Eritrea \"shall cease using illicit means to collect taxes outside of Eritrea\" remain valid. The Netherlands has said extortion and threats of force against its large Eritrean diaspora is a sensitive issue that is high on the country's political agenda.\n\nThe resolution urges Eritrea and Djibouti \"to continue efforts to settle their border dispute peacefully ... by conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement, or by any other means of pacific dispute settlement\" in the U.N. Charter. And it urges the two countries to engage on the issue of combatants from Djibouti missing in action.\n\nThe Security Council said, \"it will continue to follow developments towards the normalization of relations between Eritrea and Djibouti.\"\n\nDjibouti's U.N. Ambassador Siad Doualeh welcomed the lifting of sanctions against Eritrea, but said third-party mediation \"failed to make significant progress toward a settlement\" of the boundary dispute.\n\nHe reiterated Djibouti's call for a final settlement by an impartial third party, such as an international arbitration tribunal or the International Court of Justice, of land and maritime boundaries and sovereignty over Doumeira Island.\n\n\"But continued stalemate is not an option! We need to expedite the process!\" Doualeh said.\n\nAs for Somalia, the resolution condemns continuing attacks by al-Shabab in the country and beyond and expresses concern at the presence of affiliates of the Islamic State extremist group \"and the security implications of the situation in Yemen for Somalia.\"\n\nIt commends efforts by Somalia's federal government to restore key economic and financial institutions and implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism measures. But it expresses concern at continued reports of corruption and diversion of public resources, including reports of \"alleged financial impropriety\" involving members of the government, parliament and opposition.\n\nThe resolution extends both the arms embargo on Somalia and the ban on the import and export of Somali charcoal until Nov. 15, 2019, as the council expressed concern that the charcoal trade is providing \"significant funding for al-Shabab.\"\n\nIt condemns al-Shabab's \"increased revenue from natural resources including the taxing of the illicit sugar trade, agricultural production and livestock\" and its involvement in the illicit charcoal trade.\n\nSomalia's U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said the government \"looks forward to the beginning of a new chapter of cooperation and partnership with all the countries in the Horn of Africa\" \u2014 and wants sanctions lifted.\n\nHe urged the Security Council to establish \"clearly defined benchmarks\" for ending sanctions.\n\nOsman said the government also calls for sanctions to target al-Shabab, which continues to receive weapons and resources from abroad.\n\nAnd he asked why the council hasn't taken action against construction of a naval base in Berbera in Somalia's breakaway northern region of Somaliland which he called \"a clear violation of the arms embargo.\" Somaliland has an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to build a base at the port of Berbera.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nElias Meseret contributed to this report from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Mexican writer Fernando del Paso dead at 83", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday defended the use of active duty troops on the U.S.-Mexican border, saying that in some ways it provides good training for war. He argued that it's analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the Mexican revolutionary Gen. Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on his way to visit U.S. troops along the border in south Texas, Mattis declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. He said cost figures he has received thus far are \"not anywhere near right.\" He added that he believes, \"very quickly we'll know the real cost. So we'll keep you posted as the real costs come in.\"\n\nIn his most extensive remarks about the hastily arranged border mission, Mattis argued that it fits an historical pattern dating to early in the 20th century. He noted that President Woodrow Wilson deployed tens of thousands of National Guard and active duty troops to the border in 1916 in response to a Mexican military raid into the U.S.\n\n\"That's over a century ago, and the threat then was Pancho Villa's troops \u2014 revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States,\" he said. He noted that more recently, National Guard troops were used in border missions ordered by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, although not on the cusp of a midterm election.\n\nThe Pentagon chief said that within a week to 10 days the 5,800 troops currently deployed for the border mission will have accomplished all the tasks initially requested by Customs and Border Protection, although additional tasks are now being worked out between the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security. Mattis did not say how soon the mission might end; current deployments are scheduled to last until Dec. 15, but that could change.\n\nIn addition to the 5,800 active duty troops in the border area, about 2,100 National Guard troops have been providing border support since April.\n\nCritics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat, although President Donald Trump has said that a caravan of Central American migrants traveling northward through Mexico amounts to an \"invasion.\" Since the election, Trump has said little about the matter, and no border threat has yet materialized.\n\nAsked whether he believes there is a security threat at the border that justifies the use of the active duty military, Mattis said he defers to the judgment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who joined him at the border Wednesday.\n\nNielsen and Mattis spoke with senior U.S. commanders and addressed rank-and-file troops. Mattis told the troops their mission is to \"back up\" Customs and Border Protection. \"Right now that's our role and that's all our role is,\" he said.\n\n\"The eyes of the world right now \u2014 certainly all of the Americans \u2014 are on you,\" Mattis told the soldiers, adding that they are part of a \"non-traditional\" mission. \"We're here because of the number of illegals who say they are going to illegally try to cross into our country,\" he said, apparently referring to the several thousand migrants moving north through Mexico.\n\nOne soldier asked Mattis what are the short- and long-term plans for the military mission.\n\nMattis said the short-term objective is to get sufficient numbers of wire and other barriers in place along the border as requested by Customs and Border Protection. The longer-term objective, he said, is \"somewhat to be determined.\"\n\n\"When you're in something like this,\" Mattis said, \"it's dynamic, it's unpredictable. We'll have to see.\"\n\nIn an interview with reporters traveling with him to Texas, Mattis took issue with assertions by critics that the deployment undertaken shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was costing the military in preparedness for combat. He said military officers have told him that the deployment has been \"very good training\" because it amounts to a rehearsal for the kind of logistical demands \u2014 such as loading aircraft \u2014 that must be met in wartime.\n\n\"In terms of readiness, it's actually, I believe, so far improving our readiness for deployments,\" he said.\n\nMattis said the mission, which does not include performing law enforcement tasks, was reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers and deemed a legal undertaking. \"It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Radio correspondent Sagar Meghani contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Going cash-free is making more sense for consumers, businesses", "description": "Navigating everyday life without cash is a growing trend that comes with benefits.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/video/cash-free-making-sense-consumers-businesses-59194631", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/181114_atm_cashless_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:10:32Z", "content": "Now Playing: Going cash-free is making more sense for consumers, businesses Now Playing: Amazon faces backlash after picking NYC, Virginia for headquarters Now Playing: Amazon: New headquarters to bring 25k jobs to each location Now Playing: Chick-fil-A to de\u2026 [+1201 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Going cash-free is making more sense for consumers, businesses\n\nWhat's in your wallet while spur more people these days apparently it's not cash ABC's Karen Travers shows us the growing trend.

He grabbed yet another title after former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman resigned in protest over Netanyahu\u2019s policies, including his decision to accept a cease-fire after intense clashes between Israel and Hamas as well as other Palestinian militants.\n\nThis latest round of violence, the most intense since the 2014 war, began Sunday night after a botched Israeli intelligence gathering operation left 7 Palestinian militants and one Israeli commando dead. On Monday, hundreds of rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza, and Israeli airstrikes flattened buildings throughout Gaza.

Over the weekend, some Gaza neighborhoods enjoyed 8 hours of electricity, a massive triumph for many people. Lieberman also called for early elections.\n\nLieberman will return to the Knesset as a member, but his party, Yisrael Beiteinu, is no longer part of Netanyahu's governing coalition, leaving the prime minister with a razor thin majority of just 61 votes.\n\nWhile Netanyahu's party, Likud, said he can handle taking on the responsibilities of defense minister as well, officials from Education Minister Naftali Bennett's party, Beit Hayehudi, have told Israeli press that unless he is given the defense minister, he will pull his party out of the coalition.

They're right now they're both still in their positions of the big questions and is for how long and sources are saying the expectation is that the president will push Kirsten Nielsen out of that role as secretary of homeland security and he could be an interesting domino effect a 12 punch if Nielsen has pushed down chief of staff John Kelly could be the next to go he has been a forceful defender of Nielsen here at the White House and in fact sources say he's been trying to delay her departure. But Neal isn't has been the target of the president's anger and frustration. About the border he's not happy with the number of border crossings he's not happy that Nielsen is not pushing in enforcing stricter immigration policies whether or not she's just a scapegoat for the president on this. Her defenders will say who only so much she can do but they enjoy having been on the job a year she's at a very strained relationship with the president and certainly the expectation is. She would be part of the next big cabinet shake out current definitely watching the White House closely right our Karen Travers from outside the White House.

If they engage in sexual misconduct or are involved in accidents of any sort, a company owner can be held legally liable.\n\nEmployment lawyers and human resources consultants say they're getting more questions than in the past from small business owners who want to know what they can do to protect themselves. The safest route is to not serve alcohol. But that's advice that's often ignored; owners don't want to come across as not trusting their employees, or to be treating them like they're irresponsible teenagers.\n\nIf owners are going to serve alcohol, there are steps they can take to lessen the likelihood of problems. Here are some of them:\n\n\u2014 Have a sit-down meal in a restaurant rather than a cocktail party; the structure of the event will make people less likely to misbehave. And the earlier you schedule the meal \u2014 a lunch as opposed to a dinner \u2014 the less they're likely to drink.\n\n\u2014 If you're having the party on your premises or in an event space, hire a professional bartender, someone who has a trained eye for signs that someone has had enough to drink and shouldn't be consuming any more alcohol.\n\n\u2014 Use tickets or coupons to limit the number of drinks anyone can order. Some owners assign ticket numbers to individual staffers who then must show an ID to a bartender along with a ticket. That stops people from asking co-workers for tickets they're not going to use.\n\n\u2014 Don't have an open bar. Beer and wine have lower alcohol content and take longer to consumer.\n\n\u2014 Don't make drinking the centerpiece of the party. An activity like bowling, board games, painting, and even newer trends like hatchet-throwing will take people's minds off alcohol.\n\n\u2014 Be prepared to get taxis and car services for anyone who's had too much to drink.\n\n\u2014 If staffers are going to hold their own after-party, no one in management, including the boss, should be there. Employment law attorneys warn that if even one supervisory person is in attendance, the company could be held liable if there are accidents or injuries from staffers drinking too much.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg.

Pizano admits he can't be certain the suspicious payments were bribes, suggesting they may have even been outlays to paramilitary groups, and the conversation ends with Martinez telling Pizano not to discuss the matter with others.\n\nThe news program said Pizano, who had cancer, gave it the recording on the condition it not be aired until his death, which came last week. Authorities initially said he died of a heart attack, but that is now under review after his son died less than 72 hours later from exposure to cyanide contained in a bottle of flavored water found on his father's desk.\n\nThe Pizano recording dates from June 2015, just as the scandal over bribery payments was starting to engulf Odebrecht \u2014 revelations that that would lead to criminal charges against scores of senior politicians and business executives across Latin America. In a 2016 plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, Odebrecht admitted to paying $788 million in bribes to win contracts in 12 nations \u2014 including $11.1 million in Colombia.\n\nMartinez later became attorney general in 2016 despite complaints about his corporate background and years of service to the Aval Group, a New York Stock Exchange-listed banking conglomerate run by Colombia's richest man that was allied with Odebrecht.\n\nHe formally recused himself when his office opened an investigation into the Aval Group-Odebrecht contracts in 2017, charged a deputy minister and former senator with taking bribes and issued arrest orders against several middlemen as well as the former head of the Aval unit involved in the consortium.\n\nMartinez has since accused Odebrecht of shelling out almost $50 million in bribes in Colombia \u2014 or more than three times the amount the company acknowledged to U.S. authorities. Pizano was himself under investigation for an unrelated Odebrecht project.\n\nNow the recording has revived calls for Martinez to quit.\n\nThe union representing thousands of judicial workers called on Tuesday for Martinez's resignation, saying his apparent failure to denounce corruption he learned about in his law practice undermines his credibility as the standard bearer of Colombians' fights for justice.\n\n\"Whoever doesn't comprehend that sacred mission, or performs it with disregard, should step aside,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nMartinez through a spokesman declined a request for comment.\n\nThe 64-year-old, who also served in three previous Cabinet posts, was appointed to an autonomous, four-year term as Colombia's top law enforcement official in 2016 and he's been praised by U.S. officials who rely heavily on his agency's cooperation in hundreds of drug investigations every year aimed at breaking the Colombian cartels who are the world's top suppliers of cocaine.\n\nMartinez's cooperation has extended to ordering the controversial arrest on a U.S. drug warrant of a former guerrilla ideologue who negotiated the recent peace accord between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Kevin Whitaker in September called Colombia's handling of the Odebrecht case \"the best in the world, by far\" and attributed its success to the dedication of Martinez's office.\n\nBut his reputation took a hit when his top anticorruption prosecutor was arrested last year on a U.S. warrant for extorting bribes from politicians in exchange for soft-pedaling investigations against them.\n\nAnd he has been fending off allegations that he is abusing his authority to protect his long-time employer by Luis Andrade, the former head of Colombia's infrastructure agency.\n\nFor the past year, Andrade has been under house arrest on what he calls bogus charges that he favored Odebrecht's co-conspirators, though he has not been accused of taking bribes himself.\n\nHe has called the charges payback by Martinez for his attempt at the outbreak of the scandal to invalidate the Aval-Odebrecht highway contract.\n\nAn American citizen who previously helped run McKinsey & Company's consulting business in Latin America, he has enrolled a team of PR specialists and convinced a former U.S. senator to try to get the case dismissed.\n\nBut that effort has been complicated by the death of Pizano, who was supposed to be his key witness and is believed to have prepared detailed reports on corruption.\n\n\"Jorge Pizano was a courageous man who dared to render testimony against Odebrecht and Aval,\" Andrade said. \"Unfortunately, it cost him his life.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APjoshgoodman"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Julia Macfarlane", "title": "May facing tough choices as UK government meets to decide on Brexit deal", "description": "May is facing an uphill climb in getting the UK government on board with a plan.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/facing-tough-choices-uk-government-meets-decide-brexit/story?id=59188750", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/theresa-may-01-epa-jef-181114_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T18:34:24Z", "content": "Theresa May was meeting her Cabinet ministers on Wednesday after news emerged that the European Union and the United Kingdom had signed off on a draft withdrawal agreement about the terms of Britains exit from the Union.

Some studies have suggested they had high injury rates, which have been blamed on things like social violence, attacks by carnivores, a hunting style that required getting close to large prey, and the hazards of extensive travel in environments full of snow and ice.\n\nWhile it's true that their lives were probably riskier than those of people in today's industrial societies, the vastly different living conditions of those two groups mean comparing them isn't really appropriate, said Katerina Harvati of the University of Tuebingen in Germany.\n\nA better question is whether Neanderthals faced more danger than our species did when we shared similar environments and comparable lifestyles of mobile hunter-gatherers, she and study co-authors say in a paper released Wednesday by the journal Nature.\n\nTo study that, they focused on skull injuries. They reviewed prior studies of fossils from western Eurasia that ranged from about 80,000 to 20,000 years old. In all they assessed data on 295 skull samples from 114 individual Neanderthals, and 541 skull samples from 90 individuals of our own species, Homo sapiens.\n\nInjury rates turned out to be about the same in both species.\n\nThat questions the idea that the behavior of Neanderthals created particularly high levels of danger, Marta Mirazon Lahr of Cambridge University wrote in an accompanying commentary.\n\nBut the new study is not the final word on Neanderthal trauma, she wrote. It didn't include injuries other than to the skull. And scientists still have plenty of work to do in seeking the likely cause of injuries and evidence of care for the injured, which could give insights into the behavior of both Neanderthals and ancient members of our species, she wrote.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Malcolm Ritter at @MalcolmRitter\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

The city's massive amounts of paving had an even bigger impact by reducing drainage. Land development in the metro area, on average, increased the chances of extreme flooding by 21 times, study authors said.\n\nA second study looked at last year's major Hurricanes Maria and Irma and 2005's deadly Katrina and used computer simulations to see what would have happened if there had been no human-caused global warming. The study found that climate change significantly increased rainfall from those three storms, but did not boost their wind speed.\n\nBoth studies are in Wednesday's journal Nature .\n\nHouston was a literal drag on Harvey as it sloshed through, with the storm getting tripped up by the skyscrapers, said study co-author Gabriele Villarini, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Iowa.\n\nCo-author Gabe Vecchi, a climate scientist at Princeton University, said that forced the storm to move up higher, causing more concentrated rain over Houston and slowing, which also made more rain.\n\nHe compared it to a river running over rocks, creating bubbles.\n\n\"That's sort of what's going on here,\" he said.\n\nThis effect is dwarfed, though, by the paving and building that don't allow water to sink into the ground, Vecchi said.\n\nHarvey's record rainfall reached 5 feet in one spot near Houston. The scientists used computer simulations to see the effects of urbanization. In parts of the Houston metro area, the effects of development ranged from a 10 percent higher risk of extreme flooding in the less developed northwest to nearly 92 times the risk in the northeast, they reported.\n\nThat's on top of the unique weather patterns that made Harvey slow down and stall and climate change which brought more water into the storm, Vecchi said.\n\nMIT hurricane and climate expert Kerry Emanuel, who wasn't part of the study, called the Harvey study \"a real advance in our understanding of hurricane impacts on urban areas.\"\n\nBut Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon wasn't convinced. He said the team used generic shapes instead of the actual Houston skyline. He said the storm's wind speeds may have slowed, but that's different from the storm's forward movement slowing.\n\nThe other study in Nature looked at a variety of historical damaging storms and tried to calculate past and future effects of climate change. In three cases, the scientists simulated the storms without the changes in the climate from greenhouse gases, showing that global warming increased rainfall 8.9 percent in Hurricane Maria , 6.3 percent in Hurricane Irma and 8.7 percent in Hurricane Katrina .\n\nMaria hit Puerto and Rico and other parts of the Caribbean. Irma hit the Caribbean and Florida, while Katrina struck New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.\n\nIn Maria's case, a warming climate concentrated heavier rain in the center of the storm and reduced it on the edges, said co-author Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nFor 15 storms, which included the devastating Typhoon Haiyan , the potent Gilbert and 1992's Hurricane Andrew , the scientists projected future warming and found future versions of the same storms would be significantly wetter and stronger.\n\n\"We are beginning to see a climate change influence emerge on tropical cyclones and that's coming out as rainfall,\" said study lead author Christina Patricola, an atmospheric scientist at the national lab.\n\nAlthough replicating a storm in a different climate is difficult and can't account for certain changes, this work bolsters science understanding of how climate change alters hurricanes, Emanuel said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Volkswagen and other car makers had bet heavily on diesel models, which get better mileage than gasoline powered vehicles, to meet tough limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas scientists say causes global warming. Diesel sales in Europe have eroded, however, since Volkswagen was caught using software to cheat on diesel emissions tests and paid more than 28 billion euros ($31 billion) in fines, settlements and penalties. Subsequent scrutiny of diesel technology showed that other carmakers' vehicle emitted more nitrogen oxide pollution in real-life driving than during tests. The EU introduced new test procedures Sept. 1 that are intended to measure emissions in daily driving conditions.\n\nAs diesel sales fall carmakers are turning to electric vehicles to meeting the new C02 limits, even though consumer uptake has been slow because of higher costs and lack of convenient places to charge up.

The news network is seeking an immediate restraining order that would force the White House to return Acosta's press credentials \u2014 which grant reporters as-needed access to the 18-acre complex.\n\nKelly said he would announce his decision Thursday afternoon.\n\nAcosta has repeatedly clashed with Trump and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in briefings over the last two years.

Trump called Acosta a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\nThe White House quickly announced that Acosta's White House access would be revoked.\n\nThe CNN lawsuit calls the revocation \"an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the President's point of view.\"\n\nThe Associated Press joined with a group of 12 other news organizations, including Fox News, in filing an amicus brief Wednesday in support of CNN.\n\n\"Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized,\" said a statement by Fox News President Jay Wallace. \"While we don't condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the President and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Justice Department lawyer James Burnham argued that Acosta was guilty of \"inappropriate grandstanding\" and deserved to lose his access over \"his refusal to comply with the general standards of a press conference.\"\n\nBurnham also pointed out that CNN has dozens of other staffers with White House credentials, so excluding Acosta would not harm the network's coverage.\n\nThe network's lawyer, Theodore Boutrous, contended that Acosta was being singled out for his body of work, not his alleged rudeness during a press conference.\n\n\"The White House has made very clear that they don't like the content of the reporting by CNN and Jim Acosta,\" Boutrous said. \"Rudeness really is a code word for 'I don't like you being an aggressive reporter.'\"\n\nPrior to Wednesday's hearing, the White House had maintained that it has \"broad discretion\" to regulate press access to the White House.\n\nA pre-hearing legal filing argued, \"The President and his designees in the White House Press Office have exercised their discretion not to engage with him and, by extension, to no longer grant him on-demand access to the White House complex so that he can attempt to interact with the President or White House officials.\"\n\nTrump himself, in an interview published Wednesday, was uncertain how the court fight would end, saying: \"We'll see how the court rules. Is it freedom of the press when somebody comes in and starts screaming questions and won't sit down?\"\n\nTrump told The Daily Caller that \"guys like Acosta\" were \"bad for the country. ... He's just an average guy who's a grandstander who's got the guts to stand up and shout.\"\n\nThe White House's explanations for why it seized Acosta's credentials have shifted over the last week. Sanders initially explained the decision by accusing Acosta of making improper physical contact with the intern seeking to grab the microphone. But that rationale disappeared after witnesses backed Acosta's account that he was just trying to keep the mic, and Sanders distributed a doctored video that made it appear Acosta was more aggressive than he actually was.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders accused Acosta of being unprofessional by trying to dominate the questioning at the news conference.\n\nBoth Sanders and Trump are named as defendants in the CNN suit, along with Chief of Staff John Kelly and Randolph Alles, director of the Secret Service.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Khalil on Twitter at www.Twitter.com/Ashrafkhalil"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "US officials report a record number of tick diseases", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Add Interest\n\nFlorida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz attacked a detention officer at the county jail and now faces new charges including use of the officer's electric stun device, authorities said Wednesday.\n\nBroward Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Veda Coleman-Wright said in an email Wednesday that Cruz assaulted Sgt. Raymond Beltran around 6 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nJail records show Cruz now is charged with aggravated assault on an officer, battery on an officer and use of an \"electric or chemical weapon against an officer.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old Cruz faces the death penalty in the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others. He's pleaded not guilty in the shooting, but his lawyers say he would plead guilty in exchange for a life prison sentence.\n\nAccording to the assault arrest report, Cruz attacked Beltran after he was told to \"not drag his sandals around\" while walking in a jail dayroom. Cruz responded, the report says, by showing Beltran his middle finger and then rushing the deputy and striking him with his fist.\n\nThe report says Cruz and Beltran then \"got into a physical altercation\" in which both wound up on the floor and Cruz was able to wrest control of the stun gun, technically called a \"conducive electronic weapon.\" The stun gun discharged but it's not clear from the report whether it struck anyone; Beltran was able to regain control.\n\nBeltran was struck multiple times by Cruz using his fists, according to video surveillance cited by the report.\n\nFinally, the report says Beltran struck Cruz in the face with a fist containing the stun gun and Cruz then \"retreated to one of the seats\" in the dayroom before he was taken into custody.\n\nThe report doesn't detail the severity of injuries to Cruz or Beltran.\n\n\"We don't know any more than you do as of yet,\" Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein said in an email.\n\nCruz appeared at a brief initial hearing Wednesday on the assault charges, with bail set at $200,000. But he won't be released because he is being held without bail on the murder charges.\n\nMeanwhile, the state commission investigating the shooting heavily criticized Wednesday the actions of the sheriff's deputy assigned to the campus, calling him a coward for not confronting the gunman.\n\nMembers of the Marjory Stoneman High School commission said Broward sheriff's deputy Scot Peterson was \"not a real cop\" and was \"a coward\" as they reviewed video and photos of his actions during the shooting. They said Peterson did not enter the building to confront the shooter, but stayed outside.\n\nHis attorney didn't respond to an email Wednesday seeking comment. Peterson is scheduled to testify before the commission Thursday. He has previously said he didn't know whether the shots were coming from inside or outside the building and that he heard only two or three shots.\n\nThe commission also heard from a Pinellas County detective who investigated Cruz's internet searches, text messages and cellphone usage.\n\nSgt. John Suess said Cruz's earliest found internet search referencing school massacres happened three months before the Parkland shooting. On Jan. 21, Cruz wrote himself a cellphone note saying \"life is a mess\" and \"unfair\" and he was getting \"even more agitated.\"\n\n\"I want to kill people but I don't know how to do it,\" he wrote.\n\nSuess said Cruz frequently looked up the song \"Pumped Up Kicks,\" where a shooter sings that other kids \"better run, outrun my gun.\"\n\nAbout a week before the shooting, he said, Cruz searched \"Is killing people easy.\"\n\nOn Feb. 9, five days before the shooting, Cruz did searches seeking information about homicidal thoughts and urges and for a therapist. Some commissioners said they believe Cruz was having second thoughts.\n\nBut the next day, Cruz was again looking at videos about the Columbine and Virginia Tech shootings.\n\nThree days before the shooting, Cruz made previously released cellphone videos that he never shared outlining his plans, the commission was told. He looked up how long it takes police to respond to school shootings.\n\nOn the morning of the shooting, Cruz sent innocuous texts to the friend he was living with about meeting some girls that night or that he might go to a movie.\n\nIt was Valentine's Day and during the two hours before the shooting, Cruz tried repeatedly to engage his ex-girlfriend in phone and text conversations, but she told him to leave her alone and that she had a boyfriend. He responded, \"You will always know I love you.\"\n\nHe soon contacted Uber to take him to the school.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "French police close probe into Interpol disappearance", "description": "French authorities say they have closed an investigation into the detention in China of the former president of Interpol, and found no evidence to support his wife's claims that she got a threatening call after he was picked up", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/french-police-close-probe-interpol-disappearance-59191687", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_8b6354de554844fa944f23385ddfb8bf_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:36:03Z", "content": "French authorities say they have closed an investigation into the disappearance and subsequent detention in China of the former president of Interpol, and found no evidence to support his wife's claim that she got a threatening call in Chinese after he was pi\u2026 [+468 chars]", "fulltext": "French authorities say they have closed an investigation into the disappearance and subsequent detention in China of the former president of Interpol, and found no evidence to support his wife's claim that she got a threatening call in Chinese after he was picked up.\n\nGrace Meng, the wife of Meng Hongwei, detailed the threatening call in an Associated Press interview in October.

Police were responding to a gunfight early Sunday at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins that injured four people, including Myrickes.\n\nMyrickes, who was shot in the shoulder, told The Associated Press in a phone interview from his hospital room that he clearly heard several people shout at the officer that Roberson \u2014 who was holding a suspect at gunpoint \u2014 was a security guard.\n\nIt was not the only aspect where Myrickes' account differed from that of the news release that Illinois State Police issued Tuesday night that for the first time addressed in detail what happened in the predominantly black community of Robbins just south of Chicago. The agency declined to comment beyond the release, which came as questions have swirled about whether the shooting was justified and whether race played a role.\n\nIn its release, state police said Roberson was wearing \"plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a Security Guard.\" However, Myrickes said all the security guards wore knit hats emblazoned with the word \"Security\" on them and that Roberson wore a black sweat shirt with the word \"Security\" on the back of shoulder. But he also acknowledged that it's possible the officer could not see the white lettering from where he was standing.\n\nMyrickes was one of six security guards working at the bar at the time, but he is the only one so far to come forward publicly to discuss what happened. A bar patron also told reporters earlier that he heard people yelling at the officer that Roberson was a security guard.\n\nMyrickes, 43, said the initial shooting at the bar stemmed from a fight between two groups of people. As security guards tried to separate them and lead them out separate doors, \"Somebody came back and opened fire,\" Myrickes said.\n\nHe said he wasn't armed and that he doesn't believe other security guards fired their weapons.\n\nThe officer who shot Roberson was from the nearby community of Midlothian and was among several officers from various agencies who responded to the shooting. Myrickes told the AP that the officer ran into the bar and pointed his gun at a bar customer, the bartender and Myrickes. Myrickes said he informed the officer that he was a security guard, and the officer then went outside.\n\nLooking out the door, Myrickes said he \"could see Jemel had one guy face down, asking him to put his hands behind his back\" when he saw the officer point his weapon at Roberson.\n\n\"I never heard the cop demand him to do anything, (but) everybody was telling him (Jemel) was security.\"\n\nMyrickes also noted that none of the other responding officers opened fire.\n\nThe officer's name has not been released. He is on paid leave.\n\nVideo of the shooting could reveal exactly what happened, but the agencies involved have not said whether any exists.

Temporary protected status provides safe havens for people from countries experiencing armed conflicts, natural disasters and other challenges.\n\nLawyers for Civil Rights says in the lawsuit that Trump's move to rescind the program was rooted in animus against immigrants of color, citing comments he made on the campaign trial and in office.\n\n\"Access to these videotapes will help further demonstrate that Defendant Trump holds racially biased views that impact his policy and decision making,\" attorney Oren Nimni said in a written statement. The subpoenas also seek any relevant outtakes, audio clips and transcripts made during production of the show.\n\nEmails seeking comment were sent to an MGM lawyer, a Trump Production official and White House officials.\n\nA federal judge in July denied Trump's request to throw out the lawsuit and rejected the administration's bid to remove Trump as a defendant in the case.\n\nIn a different case in California, another federal judge last month issued a temporary injunction that bars the Trump administration from ending the protections, saying there is evidence that president \"harbors an animus against non-white, non-European aliens which influenced his ... decision to end the TPS designation.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is appealing that ruling.\n\nPressure on producers of the \"The Apprentice\" to release unaired footage of the show intensified during the 2016 presidential campaign after The Washington Post published a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about aggressively groping women.\n\nMGM, which owns \"The Apprentice,\" said at the time that it couldn't unilaterally release any unaired, archived material because of contractual obligations. The show's producer, Mark Burnett, also said he didn't have the ability or right to release footage.\n\nA former contestant on \"The Apprentice\" who has accused Trump of unwanted groping and kissing has also sought footage through a lawsuit against the president, but it's unclear whether she has received any.\n\nThe subpoena issued by Summer Zervos' attorney in May sought any \"Apprentice\" material that features Zervos, or Trump talking about her or discussing other female contestants in a sexual or inappropriate way.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Alanna Durkin Richer on Twitter at http://twitter.com/aedurkinricher ."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Cutting them off: Owners ponder limits on alcohol at parties", "description": "Business owners concerned about sexual misconduct as well as the safety of their staffers and guests are eliminating or limiting alcohol at their holiday parties", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/cutting-off-owners-ponder-limits-alcohol-parties-59191239", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_c8e19af14b7e43da97a1c20c0b91df9f_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:08:32Z", "content": "The alcohol will flow less freely, and sometimes not at all, at some small business parties this holiday season.

Human resources consultants and employment law attorneys say they're fielding more questions about alcohol and parties than in the past following the string of high-profile sexual misconduct cases that began a year ago. They're advising their small business clients to impose limits on how much people drink.\n\nLadan Davia decided there'd be no drinking at her company's party this year after two incidents at last year's gathering \u2014 a male staffer and then a female staffer who were drunk groped other co-workers.\n\n\"I'm creating a safer environment for everyone,\" says Davia, owner of Beeya, a job search website based in Irvine, California. \"While I know it can be seen as 'not fair' for banning alcohol from our holiday party, I would respond saying it's 'not fair' for anyone to feel uncomfortable especially in their place of work.\"\n\nDavia understands that alcohol becomes a form of entertainment at an office party, so she's going to have substitutes for her 11 staffers and their guests: a magician, games and prizes.\n\nHR consultant Rob Wilson has gotten many more calls than in the past from companies needing help with party policies. Even owners who haven't had problems are asking about going alcohol-free or limiting everyone's intake. Some owners ask whether they should have chaperones to ensure no one is overdrinking or trying to grope anyone.\n\n\"They're much more cautious than I've ever seen,\" says Wilson, president of Chicago-based Employco.\n\nOwners' questions come from their concerns about staffers' well-being and the fact they're legally liable if drunken employees or guests are in accidents of any kind, hurting themselves or others. The company is also liable if a staffer sexually harasses or verbally or physically abuses anyone.\n\nThere are ways to prevent problems, starting with banning or limiting alcohol. One way to put the brakes on drinking is to give staffers coupons or tickets for drinks. Another option is to serve only wine and beer.\n\nSome of Jay Starkman's small business clients struggle with the idea of not serving alcohol. They're concerned about sending a negative message to staffers.\n\n\"They're saying, 'I don't want to not trust my people, or insinuate that they're a problem,\" says Starkman, CEO of Engage PEO, an HR provider based in Hollywood, Florida. Using drink coupons is a way around that concern, Starkman says.\n\nJulia Kravets used to have an open bar at the parties at her Brooklyn, New York, restaurant, Little Choc Apothecary, but some employees drank so much they became sick and Kravets had to help them into cabs. Last year, Kravets brought in games \"as opposed to just standing there and alcohol is the only activity.\"\n\nShe did serve wine, but no one drank to the point of vomiting and \"I didn't have to revive anybody,\" Kravets says.\n\nWhen small business clients ask employment law attorney Mark Kluger what they should do, he tells them, no alcohol, period. But Kluger says that has been the most ignored advice given by the lawyers at his New Jersey-based firm, Kluger Healey, even though when alcohol is served, \"things can get out of hand and often do.\"\n\nThis year, clients' concerns about alcohol are ramped up because of the potential for sexual misconduct. Kluger suggests they follow his firm's example \u2014 it's not serving alcohol and is having its party at a hatchet-throwing venue. Kluger believes his staffers and guests won't miss drinking because they'll be having fun throwing hatchets at wooden targets, much like the events in lumberjack competitions.\n\n\"We need to walk the walk,\" Kluger says. \"Last year, we went bowling and we kept so busy, people weren't thinking, 'hey, we're not drinking.'\"\n\nJonathan Bell, also an employment lawyer, is serving alcohol at his firm's party at a restaurant. But, he says, \"we are sending an email before the holiday party about being responsible both for purposes of safety and for sexual harassment.\" He's also not allowing alcohol in the last hour of the celebration, and if his 11 staffers and/or their guests are drinking too much, he'll ask the restaurant to stop serving altogether.\n\nBell, founder of the Bell Law Group in Garden City, New York, is putting his staff on notice that they face discipline if they drink too much and behave badly. He notes that under the law, misconduct at a company-sponsored event is the equivalent of misconduct at work. He suggests all employers issue similar warnings \u2014 giving employees a reality check can help them stay in line.\n\n\"That seems to bring the focus to everyone that while they're hanging out and having a good time socially, they need to be responsible,\" he says.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Authorities have been struggling to\u2026 [+504 chars]", "fulltext": "Migrants in a caravan of Central Americans arrived in Tijuana by the hundreds Wednesday, getting their first glimpse of the robust U.S. military presence that awaits them after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of troops to the border.\n\nSeveral hundred people from the caravan got off buses and made their way to a shelter on the Mexican side near the border to line up for food. Doctors checked those fighting colds and other ailments while several dozen migrants, mostly single men, spent the night at a Tijuana beach that is cut by a towering border wall of metal bars. Several Border Patrol agents in San Diego watched them through the barrier separating the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nThe first wave of migrants in the caravan, which became a central theme of the recent U.S. election, began arriving in Tijuana in recent days, and their numbers have grown each day. The bulk of the main caravan appeared to be about 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the border, but has recently been moving hundreds of miles a day by hitching rides on trucks and buses.\n\nMany of the new arrivals were waiting in Tijuana for the caravan leaders to arrive and provide guidance on their immigration options to the U.S., including seeking asylum. Some said they might cross illegally.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, meanwhile, visited U.S. troops posted at the border in Texas and said the deployment provides good training for war, despite criticism that the effort is a waste of taxpayer money and a political stunt. Most of the troops are in Texas, more than 1,500 miles from where the caravan is arriving.\n\nThe first arrivals generally received a warm welcome from Tijuana, despite the fact that its shelter system to house migrants is at capacity. The city's secretary of economic development has said there are about 3,000 jobs for migrants who want to stay in the city. Some residents came down to where the men were camped on a beach and gave them tacos to eat Wednesday.\n\nThe Central Americans in the caravan are the latest migrants to arrive in Tijuana with the hope of crossing into the United States. Tijuana shelters in 2016 housed Haitians who came by the thousands after making their way from Brazil with plans to get to the U.S. Since then, several thousand Haitians have remained in Tijuana, finding work. Some have married local residents and enrolled in local universities.\n\n\"Mexico has been excellent; we have no complaint about Mexico. The United States remains to be seen,\" said Josue Vargas, a migrant from Honduras who finally pulled into Tijuana on Wednesday after more than a month on the road.\n\nIlse Marilu, 24, arrived in Tijuana late Tuesday with her 3-year-old daughter, having joined the caravan with a large contingent from San Pedro Sula, Honduras. She walked several miles Tuesday in a fruitless search for space in a migrant shelter before reaching the beach plaza. A Mexican couple dropped off a tent that her daughter and three other children used to sleep in as an evening chill set in.\n\nShe planned to stay in Tijuana until caravan leaders arrived and offered help on how to seek asylum in the US.\n\n\"We are going to enter through the front door,\" Marilu said, insisting she would never try to enter the country illegally.\n\nA few people pitched tents at the Tijuana beach plaza while most, like Henry Salinas, 30, of Honduras, planned to sleep there in the open.\n\nHe said that he intended to wait for thousands more in the caravan to arrive and that he hoped to jump the fence in a large group at the same time, overwhelming Border Patrol agents.\n\n\"It's going to be all against one, one against all. All of Central America against one, and one against Central America. ... All against Trump, and Trump against all,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a couple of dozen migrants scaled the steel border fence to celebrate their arrival, chanting \"Yes, we could!\" One man dropped over to the U.S. side briefly as border agents watched from a distance. He ran quickly back to the fence.\n\nTijuana's head of migrant services, Cesar Palencia Chavez, said authorities offered to take the migrants to shelters immediately, but they initially refused.\n\n\"They wanted to stay together in a single shelter,\" Palencia Chavez said, \"but at this time that's not possible\" because shelters are designed for smaller groups and generally offer separate facilities for men, women and families.\n\nBut he said that after their visit to the border, most were taken to shelters in groups of 30 or 40.\n\nOn Wednesday, buses and trucks carried some migrants into the state of Sinaloa along the Gulf of California and farther northward into the border state of Sonora.\n\nThe Rev. Miguel Angel Soto, director of the Casa de Migrante in the Sinaloa capital of Culiacan, said about 2,000 migrants had arrived in that area. He said the state government, the Roman Catholic Church and city officials in Escuinapa, Sinaloa, were helping the migrants.\n\nThe priest said the church had been able to get \"good people\" to provide buses for moving migrants northward. He said 24 buses had left Escuinapa on an eight-hour drive to Navojoa in Sonora state.\n\nSmall groups were also reported in the northern cities of Saltillo and Monterrey, in the region near Texas.\n\nAbout 1,300 migrants in a second caravan were resting at a stadium in Mexico City, where the first group stayed several days last week. By early Wednesday, an additional 1,100 migrants from a third and last caravan also arrived at the stadium.\n\nLike most of those in the third caravan, migrant Javier Pineda is from El Salvador, and hopes to reach the United States. Referring to the first group nearing the end of the journey, Pineda said, \"if they could do it, there is no reason why we can't.\"\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum and work visas to the migrants, and its government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. Some 533 migrants had requested a voluntary return to their countries, the government reported.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat reported in Tijuana, Mexico, and AP writer Maria Verza reported from Escuinapa, Mexico."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Ugandan police say 10 students killed in arson attack", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe Justice Department on Wednesday released an internal legal opinion supporting the legality of Matthew Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general as Democrats press the case that President Donald Trump violated the law and Constitution by making Whitaker the country's chief law enforcement officer.\n\nThe 20-page opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides advice to executive branch agencies, aims to rebut mounting complaints that Trump illegally sidestepped procedure by appointing Whitaker over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nRosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, has been confirmed by the Senate and had been overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Whitaker had been chief of staff to now-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a job that didn't require Senate confirmation. He became acting attorney general when Sessions was forced out on Nov. 7 and was given oversight of Mueller's inquiry.\n\nSince then, the state of Maryland has challenged Whitaker's appointment, arguing that the top Justice Department job must be held by a Senate-confirmed official such as Rosenstein. A defense lawyer in Las Vegas is similarly arguing that a drug case involving his client should be halted if Whitaker was improperly appointed to lead the department.\n\nCongressional Democrats, meanwhile, have called the appointment unconstitutional and demanded that Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation. At least two former Republican attorneys general, Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey, have also raised questions about it, and a handful of GOP senators are urging their leadership to hold a vote on legislation that would protect Mueller.\n\nIt was unclear whether the legal opinion would satisfy opponents of Whitaker's appointment, but the document does provide by far the most detailed defense from the Justice Department of a selection that has roiled Washington.\n\nThe opinion concludes that Whitaker, even without Senate confirmation, may serve in an acting capacity because he has been at the department for more than a year at a \"sufficiently senior pay level.\"\n\nThe opinion tries to reconcile two seemingly conflicting statutes by saying that even though the department's own line of succession specifies that the deputy attorney general may hold the top spot in the event of a vacancy, a more general law known as the Vacancies Reform Act empowers presidents to depart from that order and to promote officials who haven't been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nAlthough Whitaker is not Senate confirmed and was not the deputy, the opinion concludes that he nonetheless satisfies a third element of the law by having been with the Justice Department for at least 90 days and earning high enough pay for consideration.\n\n\"As all three branches of government have long recognized, the President may designate an acting official to perform the duties of a vacant principal office, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate,\" the opinion said.\n\nThe opinion identified more than 160 times before 1860 in which non-Senate officials were temporarily appointed to fill vacancies as Cabinet secretaries or equivalent jobs, including some with no prior experience in federal government.\n\nIt said that both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had designated unconfirmed agency officials as acting agency heads and that Whitaker was not the first unconfirmed official to run an agency on an interim basis in the Trump administration.\n\nEven so, the opinion could identify only one instance, in 1866, when a non-Senate confirmed assistant attorney general became acting attorney general. The Justice Department was not established as its own agency until 1870.\n\n\"Mr. Whitaker's designation is no more constitutionally problematic than countless similar presidential orders dating back over 200 years,\" the opinion says.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a University of Texas at Austin law professor, said that although the Justice Department's legal analysis appeared sound, the circumstances surrounding the Whitaker appointment may be \"radically different from what any of these historical examples were dealing with.\"\n\n\"The one point (on) which I can hope everyone can agree is, whatever your bottom line is, Congress should fix this,\" he added. \"Congress should limit the circumstances in which the president can bypass Senate-confirmed officers in the same agency.\"\n\nA Justice Department official said the White House contacted the Office of Legal Counsel for advice, before Sessions was replaced, about options in the event of a vacancy. The department made the official available to brief reporters only on the condition that the official not be identified by name. The official would not say when exactly the White House had requested the office's advice.\n\nThe opinion didn't address the question of whether Whitaker should step aside from overseeing Muller's investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nMany Democrats have called on Whitaker to withdraw from that role, citing derogatory comments that Whitaker made about the inquiry before joining the department. The investigation until now had been overseen by Rosenstein.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nLegal opinion: https://tinyurl.com/ycc8zzad"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Man tied to synagogue shooting suspect arrested - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Man tied to synagogue shooting suspect arrested ABC News A self-described white nationalist with a social media connection to the suspect in last month's Pittsburgh synagogue massacre faces gun-related charges after his relatives reported concerns ab\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/man-tied-synagogue-shooting-suspect-arrested-59189956", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:23:09Z", "content": "Interested in Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting?

A federal magistrate ordered Clark held without bond pending a detention hearing Friday.\n\nA federal public defender assigned to represent Clark didn't immediately respond to a call or email Wednesday.\n\nAfter a gunman killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue Oct. 27, Clark posted social media messages describing shooting suspect Robert Bowers as a \"hero\" and warning of a \"dry run for things to come,\" FBI Special Agent Michael Bauknight wrote in his affidavit.\n\nClark was one of Bowers' followers on Gab, a social media platform that became a haven for far-right extremists who have been banned by Twitter for racist and harassing messages. Bowers posted a slew of anti-Semitic messages on Gab before the shooting. Domain registrar GoDaddy dropped Gab after the shooting, knocking it offline for several days.\n\nJeffrey Clark became more outspoken about his \"radical views\" in his relatives' presence after his brother killed himself, the FBI affidavit says.\n\n\"During these conversations, Jeffrey Clark defended Robert Bowers' killings at the Tree-of-Life Synagogue.

But the bipartisan commission highlights the potential security risks to the United States by China's pre-eminence in the so-called internet of things, or IoT, which refers to the proliferation of physical devices that have sensors that collect and share data and connect to the internet. Such devices could be everything from household appliances like refrigerators and air conditioners to warehouse delivery systems, smart traffic signs and aerial drones.\n\n\"The scale of Chinese state support for the IoT, the close supply chain integration between the United States and China, and China's role as an economic and military competitor to the United States creates enormous economic, security, supply chain, and data privacy risks for the United States,\" the report says.\n\nThe commission, which does not set policy but can make recommendations to Congress and the U.S. administration, is warning that the potential impact of malicious cyberattacks through such systems will intensify with the adoption of ultra-fast 5G networks that could quicken data speeds by up to 100 times.\n\n\"The lax security protections and universal connectivity of IoT devices creates numerous points of vulnerability that hackers or malicious state actors can exploit to hold U.S. critical infrastructure, businesses, and individuals at risk,\" the report says.\n\nThe United States has already taken some steps to restrict the use of Chinese-made high technology. For example, it has restricted government procurement from Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE, which deny their products are used for spying by China's authoritarian government.\n\nIn June, the Defense Department suspended the purchase of all commercial, off-the-shelf drones until a cybersecurity risk assessment strategy was established. In 2017, U.S. customs authorities alleged that drones produced by Chinese company DJI, which has dominated the U.S. and Canadian drone markets, likely provided China with access to U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data. DJI denied the allegation.\n\nThe commission is calling for Congress to push for assessments by U.S. government agencies on their supply chain vulnerabilities. It says the U.S. government depends on commercial, off-the-shelf products, many of them made in China, for more than 95 percent of its electronics components and information technology systems.\n\nLarge U.S. telecommunications providers also rely on global supply chains dominated by Chinese manufacturers. Although they do not source directly from Huawei and ZTE, major U.S. telecommunications providers rely on other foreign 5G network equipment suppliers that incorporate Chinese manufacturing in their supply chains, the report says."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: News headlines today: Nov. 14, 2018", "description": "Catch up on the developing stories making headlines.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/news-headlines-today-nov-14-2018-59188519", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181114_vod_live_headlines_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:16:26Z", "content": "Now Playing: News headlines today: Nov. 13, 2018 Now Playing: News headlines today: Nov. 14, 2018 Now Playing: Juul to stop selling most e-cigarette flavor pods in stores Now Playing: Mom, son rescued from inflatable swan that drifted miles at sea Now Playing\u2026 [+1159 chars]", "fulltext": "Now Playing: News headlines today: Nov. 13, 2018\n\nNow Playing: Harvard student is first DACA recipient to be named a Rhodes Scholar\n\nNow Playing: 'Oh my God!': Employee climbs merchandise table to avoid Black Friday shoppers\n\nNow Playing: Wu Tang Clan donates coats to people in need\n\nNow Playing: Black Friday deals 2018: Tech to toys\n\nNow Playing: How to stay safe when temperatures drop\n\nNow Playing: Family demands answers for Tennessee driver killed by concrete dropped from overpass\n\nNow Playing: Authorities work to recover American missionary's body from remote island\n\nNow Playing: Record cold and snow heading into weekend travel\n\nNow Playing: What to know about Amazon's Black Friday sales\n\nNow Playing: Black Friday shopping frenzy kicks off\n\nNow Playing: Black Friday shopping strategies: Online prices rival in-store this year\n\nNow Playing: 2 teen boys arrested for allegedly stealing small plane\n\nNow Playing: 3 shot at Alabama mall\n\nNow Playing: 1 dead, 2 injured in Alabama mall shooting\n\nNow Playing: Best deals on Black Friday\n\nNow Playing: Recipes for your Thanksgiving leftovers\n\nNow Playing: Friday Rewind: Deadly New Jersey mansion fire mystery\n\nNow Playing: 'Dead malls': Inside one man's mission to document the beauty of abandoned America"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Saudi-led airstrike kills 7 in contested Yemen port city", "description": "Officials say the airstrike late Tuesday targeted a bus carrying civilians.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/saudi-led-airstrike-kills-contested-yemen-port-city-59184556", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_5daf0916fa8d4b5c83377d9831dc6907_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:16:02Z", "content": "An airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least seven civilians in Yemen's rebel-held port city of Hodeida, Yemeni security and medical officials said Wednesday.

Swearinger revenge tour already includes wins against two of his former teams, Arizona and Tampa Bay, this season.\n\nThose were warm-up acts for what takes place Sunday: a chance to beat the team the Washington Redskins safety said bashed him like no other.\n\nThat's why Sunday's game versus the Houston Texans will be a little more personal for Swearinger.\n\n\"Houston bashed my name pretty bad,\" he said.\n\nThe Texans drafted Swearinger in the second round in 2013, and he played two seasons there before they released him during the 2015 offseason. Tampa Bay claimed him off waivers the following day.\n\n\"I never got a fair chance from Tampa,\" Swearinger said recently. \"I remember my first interview with [coach] Lovie [Smith], he asked me about all the things Houston bashed me on. I was sitting there shocked, like, 'They really said that about me? This is horrible.' I took that and put that chip on my shoulder, like I never got that fair opportunity.\"\n\nWhen Houston drafted him, Gary Kubiak was the head coach. A year later, Bill O'Brien took over. Swearinger played mostly as a nickel linebacker under Kubiak, but he started as a strong safety under O'Brien.\n\nSwearinger preferred Kubiak's approach.\n\n\"Kubiak let me be myself, let me do whatever as long as I played ball,\" he said. \"O'Brien was a control guy: 'You can't do this. You can't do that.' It came to a point where the DB coach [John Butler] took something I said wrong about the film and told Coach O'Brien. I remember it like it was yesterday. We stopped the walk-through. He cut the walk-through short. O'Brien talked to me and all the defensive coaches and chewed me out, dog. I'll never forget that. I'm like, 'Dang.'\"\n\nOn a conference call with Washington reporters Tuesday, O'Brien said of Swearinger's accusations, \"I don't really know what D.J.'s talking about.\"\n\nSwearinger said the issue stemmed from a film session in which he said he reminded another defensive back about getting proper depth in a cover-zero call because the offense could use max protection. Swearinger left the room shortly thereafter. He said other defensive backs told him the position coach was upset.\n\n\"They said, 'When you left he was like, I don't know what Swearinger is talking about, but the blitz hits right here,'\" Swearinger said. \"I was like, 'Bro, I wasn't even talking about that play.' I was going off the film and he took something the wrong way and then they had that argument and I'm like, 'What's going on?' From that day, I never could be myself in Houston again. Bro, I'm talking about film and you tell that back to the coach? I don't know what to say. After that I could never find my groove.\"\n\nSwearinger said that's the reason Houston benched him for three games in the 2014 season. But he regained the starting strong safety job for three of the last four games that year. Then it was on to Tampa.\n\n\"In Tampa I had one of the most incredible camps in my life,\" he said. \"I haven't had a camp like that since. I picked off like 10 passes in camp; I had three punchouts. The next guy had like three [interceptions]. I was like there's no way I'm not starting. I started in the preseason and then they put Chris Conte back in. I'm like, OK. If they got their guys, they got their guys. It was crazy. I did everything by the book but they just judged me because of what Houston said.\n\n\"It was crazy. It's all a learning experience for me. When I got to Arizona, it was a clean slate and it was time to go.\"\n\nAfter one year with Arizona, Swearinger signed with the Redskins. He's second in the NFL with four interceptions.\n\nIn an Instagram post Tuesday, Swearinger reiterated his disdain for O'Brien.\n\nWhen asked if Swearinger's maturity was an issue in Houston, O'Brien said, \"No. Every player that comes into the league, no matter who you are, it is a tough transition from college to professional and then on top of that you have a coaching change that DJ had to deal with.\"\n\nHe said Swearinger \"did a good job\" for the Texans during their one season together.\n\n\"You just try to make decisions in the best interest of the team,\" O'Brien said. \"DJ made a lot of plays for us here. He's a very instinctive, tough, competitive player. He's obviously gone on to Arizona and now in Washington and he's ... doing a great job, has got excellent ball skills, good tackler, tough, competitive guy. He's going to be a challenge to go against on Sunday.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Uber, Lyft to offer rewards programs similar to airlines", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

On Wednesday, the Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature updated mountain gorillas' status from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered,\" a more promising, if still precarious, designation. There are now just over 1,000 of the animals in the wild, up from an estimated population of 680 a decade ago.\n\n\"In the context of crashing populations of wildlife around the world, this is a remarkable conservation success,\" said Tara Stoinski, president and chief scientist of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund.\n\nDian Fossey Gorilla Fund via AP, FILE\n\nThe Atlanta-based nonprofit is named for the primate researcher whose work helped draw international attention to mountain gorillas and whose memoir became the basis for the 1988 Sigourney Weaver film \"Gorillas in the Mist.\"\n\n\"This is a beacon of hope \u2014 and it's happened in recently war-torn and still very poor countries,\" said Stoinski, who is also a member of the IUCN's primate specialist group, which recommended the status change.\n\nMountain gorillas live in lush and misty forests along a range of dormant volcanoes in east Africa. Their habitat falls inside national parks spanning parts of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nFossey, who died in 1985, had projected that the primates may be extinct by 2000. Instead, their populations have been slowly increasing thanks to sustained and well-funded international conservation efforts.\n\nDian Fossey Gorilla Fund via AP\n\n\"We have made progress in terms of their protection, in terms of allowing an environment where mountain gorillas can continue to thrive and grow,\" said Anna Behm Masozera, director of the International Gorilla Conservation Program, based in Kigali, Rwanda. \"But it's important to note that mountain gorillas' numbers could still slip back very quickly. We still have just two fragile and small populations,\" split between two national park areas.\n\nSeveral factors have enabled mountain gorillas' modest rebound, said Masozera.\n\nThe three governments have stepped up enforcement of national park boundaries \u2014 areas where hunting, logging and paved roads are illegal.\n\nTourism helps too: Visitors pay up to $1,500 an hour to watch gorillas, money that helps pay for park rangers.\n\n\"Primate ecotourism, done right, can be a really significant force for funding conservation,\" said Russ Mittermeier, chief conservation officer at Global Wildlife Conservation. \"It gives local governments and communities a tangible economic incentive to protect these habitats and species.\"\n\nThere's also health care. Gorilla Doctors, a nongovernmental group, has trained veterinary staff in each of the countries where the mountain gorillas live.\n\nHunting in the national parks is illegal, but nearby residents still set traps to catch other animals, such as antelopes. Those traps can also grab gorillas' arms and legs.\n\nWhen gorillas are found struggling with snares, the vets are called in to clean wounds. Kirsten Gilardi, U.S. director for the organization, called it \"extreme conservation.\"\n\nOther experts said the emergency vet interventions play a significant role in maintaining mountain gorilla populations.\n\n\"It's a total conservation win, and there aren't that many of them,\" said Gilardi.\n\nOn Wednesday, the IUCN also announced that bans on commercial whaling in the North Pacific Ocean and elsewhere had allowed some whale populations to rebound. The fin whale's status was updated from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable,\" a less critical designation.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Toys R Us and Bon-Ton have liquidated. Sears Holdings Corp., which operates Sears and Kmart stores, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month. And J.C. Penney is floundering. Macy's says it's seeing increased business in the Midwest where Bon-Ton used to operate and it's aggressively courting its customers.\n\nBut Macy's focus is solidly on Macy's. It's been expanding its store label brands to differentiate itself from rivals. It's also adding more of its off-price Backstage stores and putting into place technology that allows customers to skip the line at the register.\n\nIt's rolling out multiple layers of technology to offer people something they can't get online, such as the use of virtual reality in its furniture and cosmetics sections. The company's revamped loyalty card program has helped keep its best customers engaged.\n\nAnd it's trying to become more nimble. Macy's acquired Story, a concept store, which rotates themes and what it sells every few months. It brought Story founder Rachel Shechtman aboard to help create a more vibrant shopping experience at Macy's.\n\nAnd in a more radical maneuver, the company is shrinking in order to grow.\n\nAfter closing more than 100 stores over the past several years, it's going to see how cluster of smaller stores work with today's customers.\n\nThe company released details of the new footprint to the Wall Street Journal earlier this week.\n\nCEO Jeff Gennette told industry analysts Wednesday that it's testing four different models for the new \"neighborhood stores\" format and promised to share details early next year.\n\n\"Macy's recipe for success is e-commerce, healthy stores and a great mobile experience that ties it all together,\" Gennette said, noting that the department store will hit a billion dollars in mobile sales this year.\n\nIt's still early, but industry watchers believe Macy's is on the right track in this altered retail landscape.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said consumer tracking data supports the story of an ongoing recovery.\n\nAt this time last year, 59 percent of Macy's customers rated their shopping experience as good or very good, Saunders said, based on its research. This year that figure has risen to 67 percent, Saunders said. He wrote that his data also show that for the first time in over eight years, the number of people saying they will visit Macy's to do holiday shopping has risen.\n\n\"Along with the good sales numbers, these pieces of evidence underline that Macy's is succeeding in creating a stronger appeal,\" he wrote.\n\nMacy's Inc. reported third-quarter profits of $62 million, or 20 cents per share. Per-share earnings adjusted for one-time gains and losses were 27 cents, or 13 cents better than industry analyst expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nThe Cincinnati chain's revenue of $5.4 billion also beat expectations.\n\nSales at stores opened at least a year rose 3.3 percent, its fourth straight quarter of gains after a three-year slump. The figure included sales from its licensed departments.\n\nMacy's now expects annual profits to increase from $3.95 and $4.15 per share, to between $4.10 and $4.30.\n\nMacy's kicked off the earnings season for department stores. J.C.

It was only after the photo garnered social media attention over the weekend that he started to hear about it. Schieber, who is black, was singled out due to his race, though he had both arms at his side in the photo.\n\n\"Somebody had made a meme or something, saying, 'We even got the black kid to throw it up,'\" Schieber told ABC News. \"I couldn't go nowhere without people being like, 'Are you that kid from the picture? Everybody was sharing it, talking about racial profiling. I went to school on Monday and people were trying to take pictures with me -- you're going viral, all that stuff.\n\n\"I left school because I was not having it,\" he added.\n\nWheel Memories posted thumbnails of several photos from the shoot on its website in the spring, including the one in question. The photos have since been removed and the agency wrote on its site in a message that it blames \"jerks\" and online negativity.\n\n\"It is too bad that there are those in society who can and do take the time to be jerks; knowingly and willingly to be jerks!

But the Italian government stuck with its spending plans and refused to budge from its budget deficit forecast for next year of 2.4 percent of annual GDP.\n\nThe worry in Brussels and in financial markets, where interest rates on Italian bonds have spiked sharply, is that the budget plans would debt from falling, as promised. The interest rate on Italy's benchmark 10-year bond rose 0.03 percentage point Wednesday to 3.48 percent.\n\nIn his letter to the Commission, Economic Minister Giovanni Tria said Italy needs social spending to address growing poverty resulting from earlier austerity measures, and that the rollback on pension reforms would help renew the labor market and get young people working.\n\nTria said the government's budget plan would help bolster Italy's growth. Italy has stagnated for years and its economy, the third-largest in the eurozone, has lagged its main European partners. He said growth would rise \"thanks to the fiscal expansion the new reforms, the relaunch of investments and the reduced fiscal pressure on small businesses.\"\n\nWolfango Piccoli of Teneo consultancy said political considerations ahead of European elections would likely mean that sanctions on Italy won't materialize until late spring, \"if they materialize at all.\"\n\nItaly did make some minor changes to its budget in its response to the commission. For example, it said it would sale government property. However, analysts said the sale program was unlikely to deliver the 1 percent of GDP targeted by Italy.\n\nThe budget clash and economic uncertainty generated by the populist government have already been costly to the Italian economy. According to calculations by the Turin-based Hume Foundation, Italian government bonds, corporate bonds and the Italian stock exchange have shed 175.5 billion euros ($200 billion) in value since May."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Authorities: Prosecuting Ohio massacre case could last years", "description": "Authorities say prosecuting an Ohio family of four arrested in the gruesome slayings of eight people from another family could take years", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/authorities-prosecuting-ohio-massacre-case-years-59185459", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_26ede51ae8be4d0ba5a13562af2368e5_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:40:33Z", "content": "Prosecuting an Ohio family of four arrested in the gruesome slayings of eight people from another family could take years to conclude, a county prosecutor said as the first break in the more than two-year-old case was announced.

George \"Billy\" Wagner III was arrested after being found in a horse trailer in Lexington Tuesday. The 47-year-old Wagner waived his rights to an extradition hearing in a brief appearance Wednesday in Lexington district court.\n\nThe announcement of Wagner's arrest along with his wife and two adult sons marked the culmination of a massive investigation that began after seven adults and a teenage boy were found shot in the head at four separate rural Ohio homes in April 2016. The killings terrified Ohio residents and spawned rumors that it was a drug hit, but prosecutors suggested Tuesday the attack had stemmed from a custody dispute.\n\nThe investigation is one of the most complicated and extensive in state history, with enormous numbers of witnesses and a huge amount of evidence, said Pike County Prosecutor Rob Junk.\n\n\"There is a lot of hard work ahead of us. I cannot emphasize that enough. An indictment is only the beginning of the case,\" Junk said Tuesday, adding the case may have to be moved to a different county because of pre-trial publicity.\n\nOther Pike County officials are concerned about the costs and issues they will face in housing the suspects, such as added security and other needs. County Commissioner Blaine Beekman said Wednesday the county of 28,000 is already in a budget crunch and officials plan to meet with Junk before reaching out to state officials for help.\n\n\"Obviously, we are pleased that the arrests have been made and that, if the evidence is there, the people will be brought to justice,\" Beekman said. \"But it's a double-edged sword. ... Now comes the reality of how are we going to pay for this? We have no book to refer to. There are just so many unknowns.\"\n\nOhio Attorney General Mike DeWine said a grand jury indicted the Wagners on aggravated murder charges. Police arrested Wagner; his wife, 48-year-old Angela Wagner; and his sons George Wagner III, 27, and Edward Wagner, 26. They could be sentenced to death if convicted, DeWine said.\n\nEdward Wagner was also charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for having sexual contact with Rhoden when she was 15 years old and he was 20 years old, DeWine's office said.\n\nDeWine gave scant detail about why the victims were killed, other than saying the custody of a young child played a role.\n\nTony Rhoden, who lost two brothers in the killings, said the family was still processing the news.\n\n\"We just don't know what to think,\" Rhoden told the Columbus Dispatch. \"It's a lot to take in.\"\n\nThe Wagner family lived near the scenes of the killings about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Columbus. They moved to Kenai, Alaska, in June 2017, then returned to Ohio this past spring.\n\nKelly Cinereski, an Alaskan pastor and friend of the family, told the Dayton Daily News he was shocked by their arrests.\n\n\"These people wept over dogs, I can't imagine them taking people's lives,\" he said.\n\nFredericka Wagner, the mother of Billy Wagner, and Rita Newcomb, the mother of Angela Wagner, were also arrested and charged with misleading investigators.\n\nBoth Edward Wagner and Angela Wagner previously told the Cincinnati Enquirer they were not involved in the killings.\n\nAngela Wagner said in an email to the newspaper what happened was devastating and Hanna Rhoden was like a daughter to her. Wagner also told The Enquirer her husband, George, and Christopher Rhoden Sr. were more like brothers than friends.\n\nJohn Clark, a lawyer who has been representing the Wagners, has said previously that four of the Wagner family members provided laptops, phones and DNA samples to investigators and agreed to be interviewed about the slayings.\n\n\"We look forward to the day when the true culprits will be discovered and brought to justice for this terrible tragedy,\" Clark said in a statement.\n\nThe victims were 40-year-old Christopher Rhoden Sr.; his ex-wife, 37-year-old Dana Rhoden; their three children, 20-year-old Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 16-year-old Christopher Jr., and 19-year-old Hanna; Clarence Rhoden's fianc\u00e9e, 20-year-old Hannah Gilley; Christopher Rhoden Sr.'s brother, 44-year-old Kenneth Rhoden; and a cousin, 38-year-old Gary Rhoden.

In 2017, Black Friday weekend represented less than 14 percent of the month's sales. Edmunds analysts expect this downward trend to continue this year.\n\nFor car shoppers, the trend translates to greater flexibility and less stress. Here's what you need to know about getting a great deal.\n\nTHE LEFTOVER EFFECT\n\nThe sales season is extending partly because carmakers are more willing to let outgoing models linger at dealership lots.\n\nThe trend showed up in earnest early this year. In March 2018, roughly 28 percent of new vehicles sold were brand-new 2017 models. Compare that with the previous five years, where leftover inventory made up just 12 percent of March sales on average.\n\nEdmunds analysts predict that at least 20 percent of new vehicles for sale early next year will be 2018 models. Based on inventory levels of new 2018 models currently on dealer lots, expect to see a good supply of new 2018 midsize sedans, midsize SUVs and compact SUVs as late as March 2019, along with specials to move them out.\n\nIf you're a bargain hunter, that's good news. Instead of having to shop on just one weekend, you have more time to snag a great deal.\n\nSHOULD I BUY NOW?\n\nStart price-shopping immediately if you know the make and model you want. Once you've got a good feel for how much the car will cost now, you may want to pull the trigger if you fall into any of these categories:\n\n\u2014 You're planning to lease your next vehicle: Because of the way leases are calculated, waiting isn't likely to help you.\n\n\u2014 Your local dealership is running an aggressive promotion: It's possible that a dealership selling the brand you're after might have a unique sales goal to hit. It could offer Black Friday incentives to get you to buy now. Free iPads, televisions or in-house zero percent interest loans are some of the perks dealerships have used to entice shoppers in years past.\n\n\u2014 You're looking for something specific: The longer you wait, the less selection you'll have. While prices on 2018 models may continue their slide through the first quarter of 2019, a low price on the wrong vehicle is a bad compromise.\n\n\u2014 The vehicle you're eyeing has a special low-interest rate offer: Interest rates are rising, and that trend is expected to continue. If you've found an attractive price on the right car, and the interest rate is a good one (given the times), you might want to make a deal. If you wait for a lower selling price but get saddled with a higher interest rate, you haven't done yourself any favors.\n\nSHOULD I WAIT?\n\nYou may want to consider holding off on your purchase if you fall into any of these categories:\n\n\u2014 You plan to purchase with cash: As cars languish on dealer lots, chances are that good prices will go even lower. If you're paying cash and aren't concerned with rising interest rates, waiting may save you money.\n\n\u2014 Your vehicle needs are flexible: Most of the hot products are going to be sold first. If you don't mind selecting from what's left in exchange for a lower selling price, it may make sense to wait.\n\n\u2014 Your credit is iffy: Maybe you can't get a low interest rate now because of your credit profile, but you still want to get a heavily discounted clearance vehicle. Use this time to improve your credit standing so you'll be able to take advantage of clearance pricing and a low interest rate in early 2019.\n\nEDMUNDS SAYS: Black Friday is still an excellent time to buy a car. But unlike the doorbuster deals at your local big-box retailer, the Black Friday specials at a car dealership are likely to be around well after the holiday weekend.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

Because Polquin didn't receive a 50 percent-plus-one majority, he did not win and the votes of the election's non-competitive independent candidates will now be transferred to their supporters' second and third choices in the race until the threshold is surpassed.\n\nStanding to benefit is Poliquin's Democratic challenger Jared Golden, who only trails the Republican by about 2,000 votes and who it is widely assumed is the major party candidate preferred by most independent voters, hence Poliquin's lawsuit.\n\nChallenges to the system have failed in the past and the will of Mainers clearly sides with ranked-choice, so it is unclear if Poliquin has a chance to cut the vote off at one round.

According to the group, witnesses saw one person being \"kidnapped\" from the Beijing campus, while others in Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Shanghai also disappeared.\n\nThey were involved in a coalition, led by young Marxist activists, that was founded this summer to show solidarity with factory workers at Jasic Technology, a welding equipment manufacturer in southern China.\n\nActivists in China are routinely \"disappeared\" by authorities working for the ruling Communist Party, which is wary of any collective action and potential threats to its authority. The government is particularly guarded about campus movements after the 1989 student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square that were ultimately crushed by the military.\n\nThe young Marxists are an unusual target, however, because they espouse the same values \u2014 socialism, workers' rights and Marxist ideology \u2014 the party has advocated.\n\nThe sudden disappearances all occurred around 9 p.m. on Friday, the Jasic Workers Support Group said. Three others in Wuhan, including one factory worker, were taken away by police on Sunday, though one was released early the next day.\n\nPeking University students and alumni expressed alarm after students published accounts online saying that they were beaten on campus by unidentified men who forced a recent graduate named Zhang Shengye into a car on Friday evening.\n\nIn a statement posted on an internal Peking University forum, the school's security department said the \"situation\" on Friday was that of a \"police department lawfully taking into custody a criminal suspect ... who is not a current student, teacher or employee of the school.\"\n\nA member of the security department confirmed over the phone Wednesday that the statement came from the university.\n\nOne fourth-year history student, writing on the Jasic Workers Support Group's website, said he was thrown to the ground outside of a lecture hall by five people dressed in black.\n\nWhen he asked them who they were, he recalled, one swore at him and yelled, \"If you keep yelling, we'll keep hitting you!\" Shortly afterward, a tall, burly man started kicking his head.\n\nThe student said he then saw that someone was being dragged into a car that swiftly drove away.\n\nThe student who wrote this account could not be reached on Wednesday. Members of the Jasic Workers Support Group, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe he has been forced to leave campus for the time being.\n\nSomeone who identified himself as a third-year Peking University medical student said in an online post Wednesday that he had a similar encounter on that same night, when people in dark clothing rushed at him and held him to the ground until he bled.\n\nThirteen Peking University alumni attached their names to a public letter Wednesday evening protesting the treatment of the students, who said they were beaten.\n\nDecrying the \"illegal, gang-like violence,\" they wrote, \"Peking University should be a place where rule of law thrives!\"\n\nZhang, who graduated from Peking University's pharmaceutical school this year, was a vocal member of the Jasic Workers Support Group. He was among about 50 young people from across the country who convened in an apartment near Shenzhen in August to rally behind Jasic factory workers who were fired for trying to form a union.\n\nThe apartment was stormed by police in riot gear and the group members were detained for a few days before authorities escorted them back to their hometowns. Several had their phones confiscated for the remainder of the summer and continued to be hounded by police back home, according to a student who took part in the action."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Kelly Terez and Treavor Hastings", "title": "'Start Here': White House clashes and El Chapo's trial.

White House staff shakeup: Trump eyeing new chief of staff, DHS secretary\n\nPresident Donald Trump is considering firing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News.\n\nNielsen is expected to leave her role in the coming weeks and could be asked to resign, according to sources, but Kelly is fighting to delay her departure.\n\nAmid the potential impending departures, another administration official was targeted by first lady Melania Trump. In a statement released by her spokeswoman, the first lady called for Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel to be fired: \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\u201d\n\nIt was an unusual move for the normally discreet first lady to be publicly involved in staffing issues. Ricardel still had a job as of Tuesday night, and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told ABC News she did not have any new personnel announcements.\n\nABC News White House Correspondent Tara Palmeri walks us through what\u2019s happening in the West Wing and the East Wing.\n\nJabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\n2. Amazon announces HQ2 in NYC, Northern Virginia\n\nDozens of cities across the country pitched Amazon on becoming the site of its second headquarters, and after a year of hype, the e-commerce giant chose New York City and a suburb of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe company will invest a total of $5 billion in the new locations, bringing 50,000 jobs to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens and Arlington, Virginia, in exchange for more than $2 billion in incentives, Amazon announced in a statement.\n\nCritics are questioning Amazon's motives with the HQ2 sweepstakes if the company was ultimately going to choose two of the richest areas in the country. It's not that cities were played, it's that Amazon \"played the system,\" according to ABC News Chief Business and Economics Correspondent Rebecca Jarvis.\n\n\"This is sort of the state of play when it comes to American jobs and how various states and cities recruit top companies to come and work with them,\" she tells us.\n\nEduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\n3. Opening statements begin in 'El Chapo' trial\n\nOpening statements have begun in the trial of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who faces 17 criminal charges, including drug trafficking, murder and torture.\n\nThe defense argues Guzman, 61, is a scapegoat and not the real leader of the Sinaloa cartel, but Guzman once boasted in a Rolling Stone interview with actor Sean Penn in 2015: \"I supply more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors say they will show jurors evidence that links the cartel leader to nearly three dozen murders.\n\n\"He's sort of the Al Capone of the global drug trade,\" ABC News' Aaron Katersky tells us. \"In a hierarchical, very mafia-like organization, [he] was able to climb the ladder by figuring out how to get drugs into the United States when certain traditional smuggling routes were cut off.\"\n\nMexican Interior Ministry/AFP/Getty Images\n\n4.

She attributed Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 partly to the disintegration and linguistic isolation of the local, mainly Russian-speaking population from the rest of Ukraine.\n\n\"This is something that we would like not to repeat in the western part of our country,\" Novosad said.\n\nVasyl Filipchuk, a Ukrainian diplomat and chair of the board of the International Center For Policy Studies in the capital Kiev, said the anti-Hungarian campaign was being used to distract voters.\n\n\"It's artificial, manipulative technology\" to overshadow the real problems of the people \u2014 corruption, lack of jobs and lack of economic prospects, Filipchuk said, adding that the use of patriotic, nationalistic rhetoric is \"very dangerous.\"\n\nSome of the issues have triggered a diplomatic dispute between Ukraine and Hungary, with Hungary blocking Ukraine's talks on integration with the European Union and NATO until the language stipulations in the education law are revised. In early October, Ukraine expelled a Hungarian consul after a secret video surfaced of Ukrainian Hungarians taking the oath of Hungarian citizenship. In response, Hungary expelled a Ukrainian consul.\n\nAlmost all members of Ukraine's Hungarian minority live in Transcarpathia \u2014 called Zakarpattia Oblast in Ukrainian and Karpatalja in Hungarian. The last census, from 2001, counted 151,000 Hungarians, but unofficial estimates now see around 120,000.\n\nScores have emigrated to Hungary and western Europe, driven in part by Ukraine's economic crisis and facilitated by the possibility of acquiring dual Hungarian citizenship, which comes with a European Union passport.\n\nIt's a community that is still strongly tied to Hungary \u2014 everyone seems to set their watches to Hungary's time zone, an hour behind Ukraine's.\n\nJozsef Kantor, principal of a high school with some 700 students in Velyka Dobron, a village near Chop with a majority Hungarian population, acknowledged that a more modern education law was needed. Still, he lamented the \"much harsher and unfavorable education law\" now proposed.\n\nAt Kantor's school, which is undergoing renovations paid mostly by subsidies from the Hungarian government, Ukrainian language and literature are the only classes not taught in Hungarian. National authorities seem open to developing Ukrainian language textbooks which would take into account the fact that many Hungarian children enter school without speaking much, if any, Ukrainian.\n\nMany of the school's graduates are taking advantage of having an EU passport to get their higher education in Hungary or elsewhere abroad.\n\n\"What affects us negatively is that many of them don't come back,\" Kantor said. \"Ultimately, if this continues for 20 or 30 years, there's a risk that the intellectual class among Hungarians in Transcarpathia will shrink significantly.\"\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has made a name for himself in Europe through his unrelenting anti-immigration and nationalist policies, has made supporting the estimated 2.2 million Hungarians living in neighboring countries \u2014 lands that Hungary lost after World War I and the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire \u2014 a key objective.\n\nSubsidies totaling some $60.1 million have been given to institutions, businesses and families abroad since 2017, and Brenzovics, the lawmaker, said the payments have helped establish 3,000 new businesses.\n\nOfficials have simplified steps for Hungarians abroad to acquire dual Hungarian citizenship. An initial goal of adding 1 million dual citizens \u2014 on top of Hungary's population of some 10 million \u2014 was achieved nearly a year ago.\n\nOrban's efforts have created a political windfall. In April's elections, over 95 percent of voters casting ballots by mail \u2014 mostly from neighboring countries \u2014 backed Orban's coalition led by his Fidesz party, helping him to a third consecutive term.\n\nIn Chop, teacher Zsuzsanna Dzjapko, a Hungarian whose husband's family is Russian-Ukrainian, has accepted the fact that the best educational prospects for their 11-year-old daughter Rebeka \u2014 who speaks all three languages and is a talented singer and musician \u2014 are across the border.\n\n\"I don't have hopes that she'll come back, because as a Hungarian folk singer in this country, she wouldn't have much of a future,\" Dzjapko said in a small apartment shared by three generations. \"We hope the times will change, the winds will change and the laws will change, as well.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "'Never Nancy': Democrats ramp up efforts to sideline Pelosi, without offering an alternative - ABC News", "description": "ABC News 'Never Nancy': Democrats ramp up efforts to sideline Pelosi, without offering an alternative ABC News A band of House Democrats determined to oppose House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's speaker bid are planning to release a signed letter as soon as t\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nancy-democrats-ramp-efforts-sideline-pelosi-offering-alternative/story?id%3D59180391", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T09:33:13Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Benjamin Siegel", "title": "Democrats ramp up efforts to sideline Nancy Pelosi, without an alternative", "description": "\"It's time for a change,\" Rep.

Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a member of the group, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nPelosi, who has said she's \"100 percent confident\" that she will be the next House speaker, has been working since last week on her bid, meeting and talking with new members and incumbent Democrats, to shore up support.\n\nSteven Senne/AP\n\nProminent Democrats outside of Washington D.C. \u2013 from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, to former Sen. John Kerry and former Vice President Al Gore \u2013 have been making calls on her behalf, and influential House Democrats and activists have provided a steady drumbeat of public endorsements.\n\nBut Pelosi's critics argue that she has an increasingly apparent math problem. While she's expected to lock up the caucus speaker vote with a majority of members on Nov. 28, they're hoping to publicly release their letter before that vote to hammer their point home.\n\n\"It's time for a change,\" Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Texas, who is opposed to Pelosi, told ABC News. \"It's time for new blood.\"\n\nABC News has identified at least 14 sitting Democrats and incoming members who have vowed to oppose Pelosi on the House floor.\n\nSources involved in the effort say that number has grown to at least 20 members, with many more incoming Democrats undecided. Pelosi can only afford to lose six votes \u2013 a number that could grow to 14 if Democrats win the eight House races yet to be called.\n\n\"The whole point of the letter is to accelerate this process so that it doesn\u2019t spill out onto the floor. She\u2019s the one that is driving this to a floor vote. We want to make it clear before it comes to that that she should step aside,\" Moulton said.\n\nPelosi's allies say the California Democrat \u2013 a veteran of countless leadership battles and whipping efforts \u2013 is working methodically to line up the votes. Her team is listening to incoming members and sitting Democrats about their priorities and desired changes to rules governing the House floor, and believe there is still a path for her to reach 218 \u2013 or a majority of House members present and voting \u2013 on the House floor.\n\n\"I think she'll navigate it,\" Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., a rising star in the party who is running for a lower-level post, said Tuesday. \"She's a smart woman.\"\n\nAP\n\nOne option her allies are exploring is tinkering with the threshold she needs to clinch the gavel: Pelosi can win on the floor with less than 218 votes if she can convince her critics not to vote, or vote \"present,\" instead of for her or another candidate. They are also making the case to incoming members that voting against her in caucus but for her on the floor (in support of the caucus recommendation) will provide them with sufficient cover for their re-election races.\n\nCharlie Neibergall/AP\n\nPelosi's allies have also been quick to criticize the group vowing to block her as working to derail the will of the majority of House Democrats, and have ridiculed the group for not being able to find a candidate to challenge her for speaker head-on.\n\n\"If they\u2019re foolish enough to sign their names to a letter when they don't have to, when they don\u2019t know whether Pelosi is going to win or lose, and when they don\u2019t even have a candidate to oppose her, then it doesn\u2019t bode well for their leadership if they succeed,\" a Pelosi confidant told ABC News.\n\nBut Pelosi's critics say they don't need a candidate of their own to challenge her.\n\n\"There\u2019s a very practical political reason why no one has come out. They don\u2019t want to alienate Pelosi supporters. So it only makes sense from a political perspective that a new candidate steps up after it\u2019s clear that she doesn\u2019t have the votes,\" Moulton, who said he is not seeking to replace Pelosi, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Pelosi's outreach continues. She's mixed and mingled with new members during their orientation in Washington, and has plans to meet with leaders of the Progressive Caucus and members of the Congressional Black Caucus late this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Democratic caucus will meet for the first time as a group since the Election Day victory, huddling in their meeting room in the basement of the Capitol with new members and tentative plans to discuss some of rule changes sought by Pelosi's critics."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Benjamin Siegel", "title": "Go bold or bipartisan?

Add Interest\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said Wednesday that a draft divorce deal with the European Union delivers the Brexit that Britons voted for, as she tried to persuade her divided Cabinet that it must back the agreement or plunge the U.K. into political and economic uncertainty.\n\nMay called a special Cabinet meeting after negotiators from Britain and the European Union broke a months-long logjam and reached agreement on divorce terms, including a plan to keep the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland open after Brexit.\n\nMinisters filed into 10 Downing St. for the afternoon meeting as noisy rival protests \u2014 one by pro-EU demonstrators, the other by Brexit-backing group Leave Means Leave \u2014 chanted and shouted down the street.\n\nEarlier, May told lawmakers in the House of Commons that the draft deal \"takes us significantly closer to delivering what the British people voted for in the referendum\" of 2016 that opted to leave the EU.\n\nMay said Britain would \"take back control of our borders, our laws and our money ... while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of our United Kingdom.\"\n\nBut Pro-Brexit lawmakers in May's Conservative Party \u2014 a group that includes some members of the Cabinet \u2014 say the agreement will leave Britain tethered to the EU after it departs and unable to forge an independent trade policy.\n\nEuroskeptic Conservative legislator Peter Bone warned May that \"if the media reports about the EU agreement are in any way accurate you will not be delivering the Brexit people voted for and today you will lose the support of many Conservative (members of Parliament) and millions of voters across the country.\"\n\nMay's supporters argue that the deal is the best on offer, and the alternatives are a chaotic \"no-deal\" Brexit that would cause huge disruption to people and businesses, or an election that could see the Conservative government replaced by the left-of-center Labour Party.\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary William Hague warned \"ardent Brexiteers\" that if they shoot down May's deal, it could lead to a change of government and a new referendum and \"Brexit might never happen at all.\"\n\nFailure to secure Cabinet backing will leave May's leadership in doubt and the Brexit process in chaos, with exit day just over four months away on March 29.\n\nIf Cabinet supports the deal, it still must be approved by leaders of the 28-nation EU. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said EU leaders had penciled in a Nov. 25 Brexit summit to discuss the deal \u2014 though he cautioned nothing was guaranteed and much could still go wrong.\n\nThen May will need to win backing from Britain's Parliament \u2014 no easy task, since pro-Brexit and pro-EU legislators alike are threatening to oppose it.\n\nThe main obstacle to a withdrawal agreement has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland's hard-won peace process.\n\nThe proposed solution involves a common customs arrangement for the U.K. and the EU, to eliminate the need for border checks, with some provisions that are specific to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe solution is intended to be temporary, but pro-Brexit politicians in Britain fear it may become permanent, hampering Britain's ability to strike new trade deals around the world.\n\nPro-Brexit former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the agreement would make his favored option, a loose Canada-style trade deal with the bloc, impossible. He tweeted: \"Cabinet must live up to its responsibilities & stop this deal.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government, said it would oppose any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the U.K. after Brexit.\n\nDUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson said the proposed deal threatens \"the constitutional and economic integrity of the U.K.\"\n\n\"That is not something we can support,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMay also faces growing opposition from pro-EU lawmakers, who say her proposed Brexit deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\n\nSophie in 't Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament who is deputy to the legislature's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt, said the real problem during the negotiations \"lies within the U.K., within the government, within the Tory party, between the parties, because there has not been any agreement over the relationship with the EU between any of them over the last two years.\"\n\n\"That is the real problem, because if the U.K. had a single agreed line, backed by the majority of parties and the majority of MPs, then the whole situation would not be so unclear,\" she said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Pence says Myanmar's handling of Rohingya 'without excuse'", "description": "Myanmar's leader rebuffed criticism of her government's treatment of the group.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/pence-myanmars-handling-rohingya-excuse-59184005", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_9c4eba4ade3146ed90230bb1e0789850_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T08:27:23Z", "content": "Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi rebuffed criticism from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and other leaders Wednesday over her government's treatment of its ethnic Rohingya Muslims.

I'm sure you will say the same of yours, that you understand your own country better than anybody else.\"\n\n\"So we are in a better position to explain to you what is happening, how we see things panning out,\" she said.\n\nAfter the meeting, senior U.S. administration officials said Pence and Suu Kyi had discussed the importance of having Rohingya return home, but only on a voluntary basis, with safety and dignity.\n\nPence also urged Suu Kyi to pardon the imprisoned journalists.\n\nMyanmar's government and most of the nation's Buddhist majority say Rohingya are \"Bengalis\" who migrated illegally from Bangladesh, and do not acknowledge the Muslim minority as a local ethnic group even though they have lived in Myanmar for generations.\n\nA Bangladesh official said Wednesday that authorities are ready to begin repatriating more than 2,200 Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. Bangladesh repatriation commissioner Abul Kalam said 30 refugee families would be transferred Thursday at the Gundrum border point near Cox's Bazar, where refugees have been living in cramped camps.\n\nU.N. officials have urged Bangladesh to move cautiously on the repatriation plans, saying such a move would endanger their lives.\n\nThe office of U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said it continues to receive reports of rights violations in Rakhine state, \"which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests.\" It said some 130,000 people, including many Rohingya, remain internally displaced in central Rakhine.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency UNHCR also has advised against the returns, saying safety should be assessed first.

Add Israel as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Israel news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIsrael's defense minister on Wednesday abruptly resigned to protest a new cease-fire with Hamas militants in Gaza, throwing the government into turmoil and pushing the country toward an early election.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman's decision was ostensibly a show of anger over Tuesday's informal truce with Israel's Hamas enemies. But in many ways, it was the opening round of a new political campaign.\n\nHis defection leaves Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the narrowest of parliamentary majorities \u2014 only 61 of 120 seats in his coalition.\n\nIn theory, Netanyahu can continue to govern until parliamentary elections scheduled for a year from now. But with another coalition rival, Naftali Bennett, threatening to leave the coalition if he doesn't get the defense portfolio, the days of Netanyahu's government appear numbered.\n\nHere's a closer look at the developments:\n\nNETANYAHU'S CEASE-FIRE\n\nAfter two days of heavy fighting, Netanyahu's decision to accept the Egyptian-brokered truce was more than a case of cooler heads prevailing.\n\nThe longtime Israeli leader knows well that the military option has its limits. Israel has maintained a crippling blockade on Gaza and fought three wars against Hamas since the Islamic militant group seized power in 2007. This has inflicted heavy damage on Gaza, but Hamas remains firmly in power.\n\nOusting the group would require a military operation that could take months and cost the lives of thousands of Palestinian civilians and many Israeli soldiers. Reluctant to pay such a price, Netanyahu instead seems content to keep a weakened Hamas in check.\n\nNetanyahu may also have a deeper agenda. Leaving the Palestinians torn between two governments \u2014 Hamas in Gaza and the internationally backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank \u2014 works in his favor.\n\nWith the Palestinians weak and divided, there is little pressure for Netanyahu to make concessions, allowing him to expand West Bank settlements and cement Israeli control over the territory.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has repeatedly accused Israel and the U.S. of collaborating behind his back and preparing a peace plan offering the Palestinians a mini-state in the Gaza Strip and small autonomous areas of the West Bank. That falls short of his demand for a fully independent Palestinian state that includes both territories in full.\n\n\"It isn't true that Netanyahu doesn't have a policy. He does: He is a firm believer in perpetuating the status quo,\" wrote Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea.\n\nBIBI'S BOUNCER\n\nLieberman is a former aide to Netanyahu who has been both an ally and rival over the years. He currently heads Yisrael Beitenu, a small ultranationalist party that appeals to immigrants from the former Soviet Union.\n\nA brawny former nightclub bouncer known for his sharp tongue and Russian-accented Hebrew, the Soviet-born Lieberman has sought to project an image as a gruff, tough-talking politician. At times, he has been critical of Israel's Arab minority, liberal opposition groups and even Israel's Arab ally Egypt. Sitting in the opposition, he once threatened to assassinate Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh if he held the defense portfolio.\n\nBut as defense minister, Lieberman's accomplishments remain limited, and Haniyeh is alive and well in Gaza.\n\nCalling the cease-fire \"surrender to terrorism,\" Lieberman also made clear that his frustrations run much deeper. He said he also opposed a recent decision to allow Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza and the cancellation, under heavy international pressure, of the planned demolition of a Bedouin village in the West Bank.\n\n\"We are buying quiet in the short-term at the cost of severe damage to our security in the long-term,\" he said. \"The weakness we displayed also projects itself to other arenas.\"\n\nIS NETANYAHU THREATENED?\n\nIf Netanyahu calls early elections, opinion polls forecast a broad victory by his Likud Party and his hard-line partners, including Lieberman.\n\nWith his resignation, Lieberman appears to be positioning himself for elections by painting Netanyahu as soft and portraying himself as a defense hawk.\n\nBennett, another former Netanyahu aide who leads the religious Jewish Home Party, is likely to use a similar strategy. Like Lieberman, Bennett had favored tougher military action against Hamas.\n\nAll three appeal to a similar bloc of voters. Although Netanyahu would likely emerge as the leader, siphoning off votes would strengthen his rivals and give them increased leverage.\n\nNetanyahu's rivals are eager to tap into public anger over the cease-fire. Residents in rocket-battered towns in southern Israel, typically Likud strongholds, have protested the truce.\n\nLieberman is especially desperate. His party holds only five Knesset seats, barely above the threshold required to enter the parliament.\n\nNetanyahu, meanwhile, will probably market himself as the responsible adult in a room of inexperienced children.\n\n\"I see the big picture of Israeli security that I cannot share with the public,\" he said Wednesday as he defended the cease-fire. \"In times like these, leadership is not doing the easy thing. Leadership is doing the right thing, even if it is hard. Leadership is sometime facing criticism.\"\n\nOne wild card: Police have recommended indicting Netanyahu in a series of corruption investigations. If Israel's attorney general decides to file charges, Netanyahu could be weakened or even forced to step down, shaking up any election campaign. However, if he is re-elected before a decision is made, it could make it much harder to press charges against a leader with a fresh mandate. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has not said when he will decide.\n\nHAPPY HAMAS\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas declared victory in the latest round of fighting, boasting that it stood up to the powerful Israeli military. Large crowds of supporters celebrated in the streets.\n\n\"The resistance has sent a clear message to the occupation that it can hurt them,\" boasted Ismail Radwan, a Hamas spokesman.\n\nAfter the dust settles, Hamas will once again have to cope with running a territory where unemployment is over 50 percent, the economy is in tatters and where people cannot travel abroad.\n\n\"We have to bear in mind that Hamas' popularity has improved on similar occasions in the past,\" said Mkheimer Abusada, a Gaza analyst. \"But that was for a short period of time, after which people would face the harsh reality of unemployment and poverty.\"\n\nHamas will return its focus toward U.N. and Egyptian mediation aimed at easing the crippling Israeli blockade in exchange for assurances of quiet."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "A Yemeni boy gets lost in a land prowled by US drones", "description": "A Yemeni boy one morning heard that al-Qaida were giving away free motorcycles, so he ran off with a friend to get one, never thinking that a U.S. drone was overhead, hunting for militants", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemeni-boy-lost-land-prowled-us-drones-59184370", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_c82690ad90c84075a173270d23a8031e_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T07:51:56Z", "content": "Al-Qaida was giving away motorcycles up in the mountains that's what the kids in town were saying the day Abdullah disappeared.

The sun had just risen above the mountain ridge, and winter light filled the ravine where their mud brick house sat at the foot of a slope. \"Let me sleep,\" Abdullah groaned from a mattress on the floor, surrounded by his brothers and sisters.\n\nOne word from his father, though, and the boy was up and dressed, trudging out of the house to the market in a neighboring village. Three hours later, when he still hadn't returned, Mohsanaa and her husband began to worry.\n\nThey were a family trying to get by in Yemen, a nation at war with itself that has become a battleground for more powerful countries.\n\nThey knew that many families like theirs had been caught in the middle, with thousands killed in fighting between Iranian-backed rebels from the north, known as Houthis, and forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the ousted government.\n\nThey knew that al-Qaida militants were based in the mountains, sending fighters out to battle the Houthis, while trying to elude missiles fired from U.S. drones that often killed innocents.\n\nAnd they knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive. He never strayed far \u2014 just to school or to play soccer with his friends in a lot so close his mother could see it from the house. At about 10 a.m., Mohsanaa and her husband called around to the couple dozen other families who lived in their village to ask if anybody had seen Abdullah.\n\nNo one had, and his parents' worry grew to panic.\n\n\u2014This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nAll around al-Said district, in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, people heard the American drone overhead on the morning of Jan. 26.\n\nThat wasn't unusual. The sky often buzzed with drones hunting for the moment to strike at the al-Qaida militants, a mix of locals, foreign fighters and Yemenis from other parts of the country who had moved into the district.\n\nFrom above, the drone surveyed an inhospitable landscape of barren limestone mountains, creased with ravines and gorges. Zooming in on those threads of green, the drone would have scanned dozens of isolated villages like the one where Abdullah lived, each just a few houses above plots of land planted with wheat and animal fodder.\n\nAbdullah's village, Shaab Arshan, sits in a wadi just over 100 meters (yards) wide in places, the bare mountains rearing up steeply on either side. Ravines and gorges lead to slightly larger valleys that eventually open into desert, the fringes of the vast Empty Quarter that takes up much of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nAl-Qaida fighters come down to the valleys to resupply and recruit in the markets. They pass out memory cards with their videos and lectures. They show up at weddings or funerals now and then, preaching to those in attendance. And they offer gifts to teens and young men, the most vulnerable and easily swayed to join their ranks.\n\nFor more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen, trying to eliminate one of the most dangerous branches of the terror network. The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes, carrying out more in two years than the Obama administration did over its entire eight years \u2014 176, compared to 154. More than 300 people \u2014 militants and civilians \u2014 were killed in 2017 and 2018 by one estimate.\n\nAt least 30 civilians were killed in 2018, The Associated Press found, based on accounts from family members and witnesses. A few weeks before Abdullah's disappearance, a drone's missile slammed into a farm in a neighboring province, killing a 70-year-old man and a young relative who had just returned from mediating a land dispute.\n\nBut here in al-Said district, it had been months since the last strike.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSoon after he left the house, Abdullah ran into a schoolmate who told him al-Qaida militants were giving away motorcycles in the town of Mosaynaa. The friend had heard it from a neighbor who belonged to the group.\n\nAbdullah had never thought of joining al-Qaida and he didn't want to now. He was in the 8th grade and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day. But he knew how to drive, and he wanted a motorcycle.\n\nThe boys agreed they would go get the motor bikes and come right home.\n\nThey caught a ride to the market in Yashbom, where Abdullah used part of the money his mother had given him to pay for a taxi to Ataq, the provincial capital on the other side of the mountain.\n\nAbdullah loved Ataq \u2014 the closest thing to a city the village boy had seen. His father took him and his siblings there to buy gifts at holiday times and new clothes before the start of school. He always pleaded with his parents to send him to school there as a reward if he made it to the top of his class.\n\nIt was there that his friend had been told to contact the militants who would take them where they needed to go. They had no idea how far away that would be.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAbdullah's parents expanded their search to nearby villages and called relatives in Ataq. No one had seen their boy.\n\nWhat if a driver had hit Abdullah and sped away? He could be lying by the side of the road, or maybe someone found him and took him to a hospital.\n\nAbdullah was their miracle child. Mohsanaa had complications in the pregnancy and gave birth to twins after only seven months. Abdullah's brother died within days, and doctors were sure Abdullah would die, too. He was tiny, hairless, and there were no incubators at the hospital.\n\n\"If you saw him, you'd think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand,\" Mohsanaa said.\n\nWhen Mohsanaa brought Abdullah home, she wouldn't let anyone near him. She fed him formula. She kept him warm by spreading butter over his body and wrapping him in cotton. Every day, he got better, and by six months \"he became a normal baby,\" she said.\n\nIn an impoverished country where nearly four years of civil war have pushed millions to the brink of starvation, the family had much to be thankful for. Abdullah's father, Saleh bin Elwiya, worked as a taxi driver and made enough to feed his wife, four sons and four daughters.\n\nSaleh was a careful driver, plying the roads all day as far as Aden, southern Yemen's biggest city, on the coast. He adored his children and had taught all his sons to drive, except for the youngest, Abdel-Salam, who at 8 couldn't reach the pedals yet.\n\nHe always urged Abdullah to focus on his schoolwork.\n\n\"You just study, and I will take care of everything else,\" Saleh told him. \"I don't want you to end up a taxi driver like I did because I didn't finish school.\"\n\nNow his boy had vanished.\n\nSaleh's eldest son, Zayad, and a brother-in-law, Nabil, drove out to search the roads. The two were in the army together, on a week's leave from a front-line unit fighting the Houthi rebels. At every army checkpoint along the way, they described Abdullah to the soldiers, asking if they'd seen him: A tall, lanky boy, baby face, not a trace of whiskers?\n\nFinally, a soldier outside Ataq said yes. He'd seen him passing in a car. It was welcome news: At least they knew Abdullah had made it this far.\n\nSaleh headed for Ataq in his taxi. There, he joined his relatives, searching in the markets and at taxi stands, going street by street, alley by alley through the city. He spoke little, growing more tense with every futile turn.\n\nAs night fell, they gathered at the home of Saleh's brother in the Russian Compound, a housing complex on the city's edge, built in the 1980s when Soviet experts were here searching for oil. Zayad called his mother. Still nothing, he told her.\n\nMohsanaa told him to stay there and wait until morning to resume the search. She didn't want them driving around in the dark.\n\n\"Things happen at night,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOn the outskirts of Ataq, Abdullah and his friend met a militant, who drove them in a Land Cruiser along a desert highway to Mosaynaa, through an area where Abdullah had never been before. He realized he had been gone for a long time and hadn't told his parents where he was. He thought about turning back but didn't have the nerve to say anything.\n\nThey passed through Mosaynaa, and the car wove up into the mountains to the al-Qaida fighters' camp. In a tent, they all had a meal of chicken and rice and Pepsi, but there were no motorcycles. It was too late to leave, so they would have to stay the night. The militants gave the boys a phone to send a message to their parents, and Abdullah texted his father: \"I am with al-Qaida. I'll come back tomorrow. Don't come for me.\"\n\nThe boys were offered a tent, but decided to sleep in a nearby crevasse, under some trees. They were worried about airstrikes.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhen he received the message in Ataq, Abdullah's father tried calling back to the militant's phone. It was turned off. They had to move right away, Saleh told his relatives, or else \"I won't be able to get him back.\" Once in al-Qaida's hands, Abdullah would be gone forever, sent to fight the Houthis or strapped with a suicide belt \u2014 or he might be hit by a drone.\n\nWith al-Qaida, \"all roads lead to death,\" said one of Saleh's nephews.\n\nDespite his wife's warnings, Saleh got back into the taxi and drove into the night, joined by Zayad and Nabil, along with two of Saleh's nephews who offered to help.\n\nThe search party asked around the shops and eateries still open in the markets. They learned that the boys had been there hours earlier, heading for the mountains.\n\nSaleh had never been to Mosaynaa and didn't have the tribal links needed to find his son. He needed local help, so he went to one of the few families he knew, the al-Tolsi family.\n\nThe al-Tolsi brothers were beekeepers, a common trade in Yemen, a country known for its honey. One of the brothers had links to al-Qaida, but he wasn't there when Saleh and his relatives appeared at the door of the family house. Instead, it was another brother, named Mubarak.\n\nMubarak was not connected to al-Qaida and had status in the community, working as the imam at the local mosque and performing the daily call to prayer. He welcomed the men in and offered them dinner. Over the meal, his guests explained why they had come. Mubarak said he was happy to take them to the mountains in the morning. It was too dark now. But Saleh was insistent.\n\nMubarak gave in. The beekeeper and his nephew, Naguib, a geology student at a local oil university, joined them, setting out at 10 p.m. At the foot of the mountains, they sought out a local man known to be a look-out for al-Qaida. He belonged to the same tribe as Mubarak, so they knew they could ask him to take a message to the militants: There is a man here who wants his son back.\n\nAs the look-out went up the mountain, the seven of them waited below in Saleh's taxi.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAt around 11:30 p.m., an operator pressed a button in a U.S. military base \u2014 perhaps in neighboring Saudi Arabia, perhaps as far away as Nevada or Georgia \u2014 launching two Hellfire missiles from a drone cruising above the mountain. Abdullah heard explosions in the valley and, terrified, started to cry.\n\nThe hours passed slowly to daybreak, when Abdullah and his friend made their way down the mountain. Part way down, they saw a mangled car below. At the bottom, Abdullah recognized the license plate: His father's taxi.\n\nThe missiles had reduced the car to burned wreckage. Abdullah's father and brother and the other five people inside were torn to pieces.\n\nThere were no bodies. Overnight, militants had rushed to the site and taken the remains to Mosaynaa, but their blood was everywhere.\n\n\"It was shocking. I wept,\" Abdullah said. \"I realized he had come looking for me.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNews of the deaths in a drone strike fanned out across the district, passed by WhatsApp messages and phone calls.\n\nOne of Mubarak's brothers, Ahmed al-Tolsi, was away in the neighboring province of Marib, taking their bees to flowers there. He got a message and rushed home to Mosaynaa to bury his kin.\n\n\"He is a generous man who received this family, gave them dinner and told them he would help them bring back their child,\" he said of Mubarak. \"He was doing something good and got killed.\"\n\nIn Ataq, one of Saleh's nephews heard a knock on the door at dawn. \"Your brothers and uncle are in God's embrace,\" a neighbor said.\n\nThe remains of Saleh and his relatives were taken to the town of Yashbom, where Abdullah's odyssey began, and laid out under sheets in the mosque. Saleh's legs were gone; Zayad's body was cut in half.\n\nIn keeping with Muslim custom, the five were buried right away in the Yashbom cemetery.\n\nAbdullah's mother woke at dawn for morning prayers, still worrying about Abdullah. At 7:30 a.m., neighbors arrived dressed in black for mourning and told her the news: Saleh and the others had been hit by the drone. They were all dead.\n\n\"It's not possible. We talked in the evening,\" Mohsanaa said. \"I told them not to go out at night.\"\n\nShe was terrified that Abdullah had been killed as well.\n\nThen Abdullah appeared. He had walked four hours to get home and found the crowd of mourners gathered at his house. He sat alone under a tree nearby, trembling, afraid he would be blamed, until the men went over and reassured him. Mohsanaa had her son sit beside her and placed her hands on his head.\n\nTribal leaders sent emissaries to the al-Qaida fighters to demand they leave the area. But months later, Abdullah still blamed himself, not al-Qaida or the U.S.\n\n\"It was my all mistake,\" Abdullah said. He speaks in short, muddled sentences, stooped over and looking down at his fingers.\n\n\"I was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.\"\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed that it carried out a strike in Shabwa province on Jan. 26, saying it was targeting al-Qaida. It does not release details or death tolls in drone strikes, spokeswoman Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich said.\n\nEver since, the families have tried to prove their slain loved ones were not militants. They gathered letters from everyone they could \u2014 police officers, district officials, tribal leaders, school principals \u2014 certifying that their relatives did not belong to al-Qaida. They spoke to human rights groups and the International Committee of the Red Cross, asking for an investigation.\n\nThey even held a demonstration in Ataq, attended by some 200 people, reading out a statement demanding the U.S. acknowledge that the victims were not al-Qaida and pay compensation to the families.\n\nTheir voices have not been heard. The U.S military has an official mechanism for families to request compensation for relatives mistakenly killed \u2014 a few families in Iraq and Pakistan have succeeded \u2014 but there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen, so there is nowhere for Saleh's family to submit evidence that they were civilians.\n\nAbdullah's family has shards of the missiles that killed the seven men. They keep the shrapnel printed with serial numbers wrapped in a blanket hoping one day to present it as evidence in an investigation.\n\nMohsanaa doesn't believe she'll ever see justice for the killing. With her husband gone, she scrapes by on a meager pension and tries to manage her family's grief. She doesn't speak of the killing in front of Abdullah. A pious woman, she knows he mustn't blame himself.\n\n\"This is God's verdict. If it wasn't written, they wouldn't have gone,\" Mohsanaa said. \"What's the child's guilt? He is a victim. He's a poor boy.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Lee Keath in Cairo contributed."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Bangladesh official: Rohingya repatriation ready to begin", "description": "A Bangladesh official says authorities are ready to begin repatriating more than 2,200 Rohingya Muslims refugees to Myanmar from where more than 700,000 have fled violence since last year", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bangladesh-official-rohingya-repatriation-ready-begin-59184223", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T07:46:15Z", "content": "A Bangladesh official says authorities are ready to begin repatriating more than 2,200 Rohingya Muslims refugees to Myanmar from where more than 700,000 have fled violence since last year.

The U.N. does not want the government to send the refugees back under current circumstances.\n\nDetails of the repot were not shared, but Kalam said they wanted to be \"hopeful\" in beginning the repatriation on Thursday.\n\n\"We hope we will be able to confirm tomorrow morning (Thursday) how many we are taking,\" he said.\n\nThe two countries had originally agreed to begin repatriating Rohingya to Rakhine State last January, but that was called off amid concerns among aid workers and the Rohingya that their safety wasn't guaranteed.\n\nKalam said about 2,260 refugees from 485 families would be sent back in an initial group. Myanmar officials said recently that they would receive 150 refugees each day.\n\nBut it was unclear whether the repatriation would begin smoothly amid reports that many of the refugees on the initial list have fled.\n\n\"I will not go. My wife and other family members have gone elsewhere, they do not want to go,\" 35-year-old Nurul Amin told The Associated Press outside the Jamtoli camp, where he and his family have been living for more than a year.\n\n\"I stayed back to guard my valuables,\" he said. \"If you say you will shoot us if we do not agree to go back, we will welcome bullets, we still will not go.\"\n\nMohammed Selim, 23, said his wife and seven other family members went into hiding after finding out that they would be sent back.\n\n\"We are grateful to the Bangladesh government, the Bangladeshi people for their help. Please do not force us to go,\" he said.\n\n\"If we need to go, we demand that we go back to our homes, not to any camps there. We have our land, we have our homes,\" he said.\n\nOn Sunday, the Myanmar government said it was ready to welcome returning refugees.\n\nIt said returning Rohingya would stay at repatriation camps for two days and receive food and clothing before moving on to transit camps. It said China, India and Japan were \"providing necessary assistance\" for the repatriation process.\n\nDespite the promises by Myanmar, human rights activists say conditions are not yet safe for their return.\n\nLast week, the U.N.'s independent investigator for human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, called the plans \"rushed\" and said she was concerned there were no guarantees that the refugees would be protected from new persecution if they return home.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross is one of the few humanitarian organizations operating in Rakhine state. Its U.N. observer, Robert Mardini, said Wednesday that conditions are not right for Rohingya refugees to return.\n\nHe told several reporters that the conflict between the Rohingya and Myanmar's government is not resolved, and \"so many\" Rohingya villages in northern Rakhine are flattened that there is no place to go back to.\n\n\"We still believe that the conditions are not right for voluntary, safe, dignified returns, and our concerns are for people to be able to move freely, to be safe and secure, and have a normal life,\" Mardini said. \"Nobody can claim today that the security in Rakhine is so well established that people can return safely.\"\n\nForeign leaders have criticized Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore for her handling of the Rohingya crisis.\n\nRohingya began fleeing into Bangladesh after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following attacks by an insurgent group on guard posts in August 2017. The scale, organization and ferocity of the operation led to accusations from the international community, including the United Nations, of ethnic cleansing and even genocide. Myanmar's government has denied the accusations.\n\nMyanmar officials said Sunday that returnees can get an ID document called a national verification card that will allow them to travel in the Maungdaw area of Rakhine state, and that they can then begin to apply for citizenship.\n\nBut there is widespread skepticism that any of returning refugees will ever be granted citizenship.\n\nMost people in Buddhist-majority Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya Muslims are a native ethnic group. They are viewed as \"Bengalis\" who entered illegally from Bangladesh, even though generations of Rohingya have lived in Myanmar. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They have also been denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.\n\nMany people who fled earlier violence and moved into displacement camps inside Myanmar have been unable to leave those settlements for years.\n\nMost Rohingya have lived in poverty in Rakhine, near the Bangladesh border. Marked by their religion and their language \u2014 most speak a dialect of Bengali, while most of their neighbors speak Rakhine \u2014 they are easy to target.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Tofayel Ahmad in Cox's Bazar and Edith M.

That relationship stretches far beyond the pregame and halftime ceremonies that honor veterans, and particularly ratchets up in November with the league's Salute To Service.\n\nThis year, the NFL and the Bob Woodruff Foundation have partnered to find and grant funds to organizations helping former military members. So far, 38 organizations have received grants, some in the spring and others this fall.\n\n\"One of the things we have come across are just an unbelievable amount of nonprofit organizations working to support the veteran and military community,\" says Anna Isaacson, the NFL's senior vice president of social responsibility. \"There are some reports of 40,000 such organizations.\n\n\"We hear from these organizations and we want to help every one we can, but that is sometimes difficult. The commissioner had a relationship with the Bob Woodruff Foundation and learned about the process they go through to determine which organizations should receive grants, and that there could be an awesome partnership as a grant referral pipeline. They can take our salute dollars and put them to use with the organizations doing the most impactful work in this landscape.\"\n\nThe Woodruff Foundation was founded in 2006 after reporter Woodruff was hit by a roadside bomb while covering the war in Iraq. Its $2 million affiliation with the NFL bolsters the grant work done by the foundation.\n\n\"We have now been through ... basically a whole year of granting with the NFL,\" says Dr. Margaret Harrell, the director of programs and partnerships for BWF. \"The Woodruff Foundation brings our expertise to help the NFL select the most effective and important programs that are serving the post-911 veteran population. It's a really nice partnership to ensure an increasing number of veterans benefit around the country.\n\n\"There hasn't been a huge learning curve because it's been such a delightfully smooth partnership; we have a shared interest.\"\n\nAdds Isaacson: \"This came together in our world somewhat quickly. There already are (22) organizations receiving a grant from the NFL and BWF, and some organizations we may not have partnered with have had the opportunity to engage in a partnership.\"\n\nOne of those groups is the Furniture Bank of Atlanta, a relatively small local company with a full-time staff of 11 that received a grant in October. Furniture Bank serves about 40 families a week, providing furniture to veterans and others who had been homeless and have now found a place to live. A bed for each person, plus tables, chairs, a sofa, a dresser \u2014 as many as 14 pieces, mostly used, that have been donated to the company \u2014 are supplied.\n\nBut the group takes it several steps further for those vets. It puts them to work .\n\nSome of the former military members become interns and load and unload Furniture Bank trucks. Others who show the initiative and know-how can become drivers, which allows the bank to increase its delivery schedules.\n\n\"Before we had the program, we had the idea to start an internship for someone who is homeless, help them to get a license (to drive a box truck),\" says Megan Anderson, executive director of Furniture Bank of Atlanta. \"We realized in 2014 we could expand that and the internship was a good fit with our warehouse and trucks. We had United Way seed money, and could take on 10 to 12 veterans who had to be homeless or just moving into housing.\n\n\"They work on our trucks for eight weeks, get a small stipend ... and then can go the warehouse route and get certified or get their license to drive the trucks.\"\n\nAnderson stresses that the folks they are helping are motivated to help themselves . After all, they served in the military, where motivation is a given stimulus.\n\n\"One thing we noticed, more recently out of the military members especially, is they are hard working, punctual, and have a strong appreciation for teamwork,\" she says. \"A lot of teamwork is involved here. They certainly can work as a unit. We also found multiple veterans have that camaraderie and help encourage each other.\n\n\"Maybe someone is homeless and another veteran just got an apartment, and another has a job. If someone has been homeless a while, they are pretty hopeless to some extent. Maybe they have bad luck with employment or have not been treated well, and they lose trust. It helps to see others who have succeeded.\"\n\nAnderson is certain the affiliation between the NFL and BWF has helped her group and will help others who apply for the grants. She emphasizes how easy the application process is on the NFL or BWF website, as does Harrell.\n\n\"From our perspective, the partnership between the Bob Woodruff Foundation and the NFL made applying to the foundation and getting the grant seem more accessible for a local and small organization,\" Anderson says. \"That is how we learned about this opportunity and it seemed more feasible, and it was OK that we were just working in Atlanta, which I thought was cool.\"\n\nHarrell notes that the public could get the wrong impression that all veterans are struggling when they make the transition from the military; that's far from accurate. But the work done by Furniture Bank of Atlanta is essential.\n\n\"The group Furniture Bank is serving is a group that has considerable challenges in their post-military lives,\" she explains. \"The organization gives these individuals the benefit of the doubt and works with them on an individual basis, provides them with credentials for the future, and keeps them on board long enough for Furniture Bank to vouch for them as an employee.\"\n\nShe offers a reminder to those groups that have applied but not received NFL/BWF grants that they won't be forgotten. Of the roughly 200 that BWF expects will submit a proposal, the foundation requests a further proposal from around 30 to 40 submissions, although it will engage in feedback with all 200.\n\n\"There is no set number of grants or a set grant amount,\" she says. \"It depends on the need and scope of the program and the level we can handle. Of the 200 proposals we receive, we probably wind up granting to only a small portion, but we re-engage with them to explain where their proposal did not meet what we were seeking.\n\n\"I am very confident, given our expertise from the foundation, that the money goes to the best organizations and we are excited to see especially local small programs that we were not familiar with being recognized.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014NFL"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Russian opposition leader Navalny allowed to leave Russia", "description": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny says he's been able to fly out of Russia after being told he was barred from leaving the country a day earlier", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russian-opposition-leader-navalny-allowed-leave-russia-59184006", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_fa569f2edf7e4b09aa663fcedc2fd1d3_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T07:32:46Z", "content": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny says he's been able to fly out of Russia after being told he was barred from leaving the country a day earlier.

But the campaign has had a hidden cost: civilians cut down by the drones' missiles.\n\nThere is no comprehensive count of civilian deaths because of the difficulty of confirming identities and allegiances of those killed. But in an examination of drone strikes this year alone, The Associated Press found that at least 30 of the dead likely did not belong to al-Qaida.\n\nThat is around a third of all those killed in drone strikes so far in 2018. The Pentagon does not release its assessment of the death toll, but an independent database considered one of the most credible in tracking violence in Yemen counted 88 people \u2014 militants and non-militants \u2014 killed by drones this year.\n\nThe AP count gives a glimpse, even if incomplete, into how often civilians are mistakenly hit by drone strikes, at a time when the Trump administration has dramatically ramped up the use of armed drones. It has carried out 176 strikes during its nearly two years in office, compared to the 154 strikes during the entire eight years of the Obama administration, according to a count by the AP and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\n\nThe AP based its count on interviews with witnesses, families, tribal leaders and activists. Most of those killed, 24, were civilians; at least 6 others were fighters in pro-government forces \u2014 meaning ostensibly on the same side as the U.S. \u2014 who were hit in strikes away from the front lines while engaged in civilian life.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe drone toll goes almost unnoticed in the region's conflicts. Immensely greater destruction has been wreaked by U.S. allies in the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign against Iranian-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis. More than 57,000 civilians and combatants have been killed in Yemen's civil war, by some estimates, and thousands more may have died of starvation caused by the conflict.\n\nYet the killing of a single man \u2014 Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, slain by Saudi operatives in his own country's consulate \u2014 has raised more international uproar than any of those deaths in a war waged by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and baked by the U.S.\n\nIn comparison, the toll from U.S drones in Yemen runs in the hundreds, including both militants and civilians. Several databases are trying to track the deaths, with varying results. The Bureau for Investigative Journalism counted up to 1,020 killed by strikes from 2009 to 2016, under President Barack Obama, compared to up to 205 killed in 2017 and 2018. Another database, by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, counted 331 killed the past two years.\n\nCounting civilians among those numbers is complicated by the difficulty in determining who belongs to al-Qaida in a country of multiple warring militias. Al-Qaida has joined the battle against the Houthis, and many of its fighters are incorporated into militias armed and funded by the U.S.-backed coalition.\n\nThe campaign has scored some military successes. In 2015, U.S. strikes took out Nasser al-Wahishi, the top leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the Yemeni branch is known, and several senior lieutenants.\n\nBut drones have been most effective in forcing al-Qaida to limit its movements and hide in the mountains, avoid large gatherings and restrict cellphone use. The group withdrew from areas it controlled in the south but was allowed to keep weapons and money under secret deals it struck with the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member.\n\nOver the years, the cost of the pursuit of senior leadership has been high.\n\nFor example, the U.S. has killed at least 66 civilians, 31 of them children, in the unsuccessful hunt for one man, Qassim al-Rimi, one of AQAP's founders who in 2015 succeeded al-Wahishi as the group's chief.\n\nThose deaths came in two raids reportedly targeting al-Rimi. The first was in 2009 in the southern village of al-Majalah. The second came on Jan 27, 2017, only days after Trump's inauguration, in a U.S. special forces assault on a village in Bayda province.\n\nThe civilian deaths come in a war conducted from a vast distance.\n\nDrone pilots work remotely at American bases, most often in the U.S., sometimes on 11- to 14-hour shifts housed in rooms like shipping containers lined with electronics. They operate based on intelligence from informants but they also carry out so-called \"signature strikes,\" based on observing suspicious patterns of behavior. They have a list of characteristics, and if a subject on the ground shows a number of them, he could be targeted, a former participant to the drone program told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the operations.\n\nMistakes happen from bad intel or misjudging behavior, he said. Rights groups have expressed concern that some of the intelligence may come from prisoners held in jails run by Emirati-backed militias where torture is widespread.\n\nSome of the strikes from 2018 that the AP examined appeared to be mistakes.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a drone missile slammed into a farm in Bayda province where 70-year-old Mohammed Mansar Abu Sarima sat with a younger relative, killing both, according to a relative, Mohammed Abu Sarima.\n\nThe slain men had just returned from mediating a local dispute. In a country where tribal links are powerful and the justice system nearly non-existent, such mediations are common to resolve conflicts over land or deaths. They involve large gatherings of tribesmen who are often armed, potentially raising drone operators' suspicions.\n\n\"We don't have any affiliation. They are simple farmers who don't know how to read or write,\" said the brother. \"We live in fear. Drones don't leave the sky.\"\n\nSeveral weeks later, a 14-year-old shepherd, Yahia al-Hassbi, was struck by a drone as he tended goats several kilometers (miles) from a checkpoint that al-Qaida had tried recently to seize. He was killed along with a construction worker passing by at the time, according to relatives and three local human rights workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nFurther east, in Hadramawt province, drones carried out several consecutive days of strikes in March, targeting vehicles on a main highway. Some of the strikes killed al-Qaida militants, according to rights activists in the area.\n\nBut others struck down cars carrying people who had fled to the area from a nearby province, Jawf, to escape fighting. A drone's missile on March 5 killed a 10-year-old boy, Ammer al-Mahshami, and wounded the driver, according to three relatives. Four days later, another car was hit, killing six men and boys, including a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, travelling to a funeral.\n\nSaleh al-Wahir, the brother of one of the dead, was in a car behind them. \"I saw it before my eyes,\" he said of the blast. \"Bodies were ripped apart.\" A report from the Jawf Human Rights office concluded the men were civilians.\n\nSurvivors are rare. Adel al-Mandhari recounted how his car was thrown through the air by the blast of a drone's missile. He lost his legs and an arm and was burned all over his body. The four others in the car \u2014 his brother, uncle, cousin and another relative \u2014 were all killed. None were connected to al-Qaida, said al-Mandhari, a civil servant. Two other relatives and the three rights workers in Bayda confirmed his account.\n\nSince the attack, al-Mandhari has spoken to the media and rights groups, seeking ways to get compensation and an apology from the U.S. \"I lost hope,\" he said. \"Nothing is going to happen.\"\n\nEven some strikes that the AP did not include in its count may have killed civilians, though there is some dispute over them.\n\nOn May 14, two men, Hussein al-Dayani and Abdullah al-Karbi, were killed when a drone struck their pickup truck in an area of Shabwa province where al-Qaida is known to have a presence.\n\nAl-Dayani's brother, Khaled, denied they were militants. He said his brother was a fighter in a militia battling the Houthis. \"We are against those people,\" Khaled said of al-Qaida.\n\nTwo weeks later, a 17-year-old, Mahdar Hussein al-Hag, died in a strike while driving his motorcycle in the same area. Mahdar's father said he was a high school student and was returning from buying vegetables. \"He might have been mistaken for al-Qaida youth who are active in this area.\"\n\nA Yemeni security official said the dead in those strikes were all al-Qaida members, though he did not provide evidence.

Median household income around Amazon's planned campus is $130,000 a year, poverty is half the city average and new buildings were going up long before the tax overhaul.\n\n\"All you have to do is look at the skyline from Manhattan. You can see billions of dollars of private investment there already,\" said Don Peebles, a real estate developer based in New York. \"Long Island City doesn't strike me as high on the list for needing extensive tax incentives to stimulate economic development.\"\n\nUnder the new tax law, officials in each state designated 8,700 such zones across the country. Nearly 35 million Americans live in such areas, communities that in most cases have high poverty and unemployment, or contain or are near pockets in desperate need of development.\n\nThe site of Amazon's other new headquarters in Crystal City, Virginia, is not in an opportunity zone, nor is the site of another major Amazon office in Nashville, Tennessee, that was also announced Tuesday.\n\nAmazon did not mention the Long Island City opportunity zone tax breaks Tuesday in any of its announcements about the new campus. Company spokesman Adam Sedo declined to provide details about whether Amazon plans to take advantage of them.\n\nBut investors were already pouncing.\n\nCraig Bernstein, founder of the investment fund OPZ Capital, said the capital gains break is good public policy because it helps push investors to put up the money for new housing, which may be in high demand once Amazon fills an expected 25,000 new jobs in the neighborhood.\n\n\"This will help expedite the process of building up the surrounding area,\" Bernstein said.\n\nBernstein said his fund is looking at investing in two buildings near the Amazon site to develop into mixed retail-residential space. With Amazon moving in, he said, he sees another reason to take a risk: a \"captive audience\" of workers looking for apartments and shops.\n\nSeparately, Amazon is tapping New York state and the city for grants and tax breaks worth about $2.8 billion.\n\nInvestors who plow capital gains into Opportunity Zone projects can defer taxes on those gains up to 2026. If they decide not to cash out on their investment for up to seven years, they receive another benefit. They get to exclude up to 15 percent of those gains from taxes. And they can completely exclude paying taxes on any further appreciation of those gains if they hold onto the investment for a decade. Capital gains taxes can be as high as 23.8 percent.\n\nThe $2.5 billion that Amazon said it will spend building its Long Island City campus could save Amazon potentially hundreds of millions on its federal tax bill.\n\nFund manager Bernstein said that he is not familiar with Amazon's tax situation, but that any company that is allowed to delay paying tax is getting the equivalent of an interest-free loan from the government. That benefit alone on $2.5 billion in gains is worth about $150 million in interest saved through 2026, assuming a conservative borrowing rate of 3.5 percent. Add in the portion of gains the company is excused from paying any tax on, and that would bump the savings to at least $225 million.\n\nCritics worry that such sweetheart tax savings would benefit real estate interests aiming to invest in areas that are already on the rise, or are bolstered by their proximity to expanding institutions such as hospitals or colleges.\n\nA Brookings Institution study of the administration's list of more than 8,700 opportunity zones found that nearly a third were already gentrifying, based on such factors as rent increases and the percentage of college-educated residents.\n\nThe Treasury Department, which approved the state choices of the opportunity zones, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe study's data on Amazon's Long Island City site shows the tract is already heavily gentrified and awash in investment. And figures from New York City's planning department list the neighborhood as the fastest-growing in the city, with more than 9,000 apartments and homes built since 2010.\n\nIn the past year, two-bedroom apartments off the Anable Basin where Amazon would move have rented for an average $4,300 a month, according to brokerage site Streeteasy. That puts it on par with rent in some buildings on the Upper East Side across the East River in Manhattan.\n\n\"That kind of opportunity zone already has lots of opportunity,\" said Brett Theodos, a research associate with Brookings' Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center.\n\nThe census tract where Amazon is moving has a poverty rate of 10 percent, half that for all of New York City, and the household income of $130,000 a year is double the city median.\n\nThat makes the area too wealthy to qualify for tax breaks on its own, but the tax law allows such areas to piggyback on nearby ones that do qualify.\n\nFor example, Amazon's Anable Basin site is just a mile from the census tract containing Queensbridge Houses, the nation's largest public housing complex, where the median household income is $14,000 and the poverty rate is nearly 50 percent.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nStephen Braun reported from Washington."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Iran executes 'Sultan of Coins' convicted of hoarding", "description": "Iran has executed a man deemed the \"Sultan of Coins\" and his accomplice for hoarding gold coins and other hard currency, signaling zero tolerance as it tries to shore up its currency in the face of an economic crisis", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/iran-executes-sultan-coins-convicted-hoarding-59183198", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T06:22:45Z", "content": "Iran executed the so-called \"Sultan of Coins\" and his accomplice on Wednesday for hoarding gold coins and other hard currency, signaling zero tolerance as it tries to shore up its currency in the face of an economic crisis.

There were also three fatalities from separate blazes in Southern California.\n\nHonea said the task of searching for bodies was so vast that his office brought in another 287 searchers Wednesday, including the National Guard troops, bringing the total number of searchers to 461 plus 22 cadaver dogs. He said a rapid-DNA assessment system was expected to be in place soon to speed up identifications of the dead, though officials have tentatively identified 47 of the 56.\n\nIt will take years to rebuild the town of 27,000, if people decide that's what should be done, said Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Pink and blue chalk drawings of a cat and a flower remained on the driveway, near a scorched toy truck.\n\nThe soldiers targeted homes of the missing. If anything resembling human remains is found, a coroner takes over.\n\nAfter the soldiers finished at the site, a chaplain huddled with them in prayer.\n\nThe number of missing is \"fluctuating every day\" as people are located or remains are found, said Steve Collins, a deputy with the Butte County Sheriff's Department.\n\nAuthorities on Wednesday released the names of about 100 people who are still missing, including many in their 80s and 90s, and dozens more could still be unaccounted for. Sheriff's department spokeswoman Megan McMann said the list was incomplete because detectives were concerned they would be overwhelmed with calls from relatives if the entire list were released.\n\n\"We can't release them all at once,\" McMann said. \"So they are releasing the names in batches.\"\n\nAuthorities have not updated the total number of missing since Sunday, when 228 people were unaccounted for.\n\nSol Bechtold's 75-year-old mother was not on the list. Her house burned down along with the rest of her neighborhood in Magalia, a community just north of Paradise.\n\n\"The list they published is missing a lot of names,\" said Bechtold, who's still searching shelters for his mother, a widow who lived alone and did not drive.\n\nA sheriff's deputy asked Bechtold on Wednesday for information that could identify her remains, like any history of broken bones. He told the officer she had a knee replacement. Bechtold predicted that the death toll would rise sharply.\n\n\"I feel horrible for the sheriff. I feel horrible for the people of Paradise and Magalia,\" he said. \"It's just a no-win situation unless a few hundred folks just show up out of nowhere.\"\n\nTo speed up identification of remains, officials are using portable devices that can identify genetic material in a couple of hours, rather than days or weeks.\n\nAccounts of narrow escapes from the flames continued to emerge. More than a dozen people who were trapped by a wall of fire survived by plunging into a cold lake.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that a family of four, their 90-year-old neighbor and their pets sought safety in the chilly Concow Reservoir after the roaring fire surrounded their homes.\n\nThe family stood in shoulder-deep water as flames singed the vegetation on the shore behind them. Not far away, at least a dozen others rushed into the lake after the caravan of vehicles they were in was cut off by flames.\n\nBefore the Paradise tragedy, the deadliest single fire on record in California was a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles that killed 29.\n\nThe cause of the fires remained under investigation, but they broke out around the time and place that two utilities reported equipment trouble.\n\nPeople who lost homes in the Northern California blaze sued Pacific Gas & Electric Co. on Tuesday, accusing the utility of negligence and blaming it for the fire.\n\nMatt Nauman, a spokesman for PG&E, said in an email that the company was aware of the lawsuits but was prioritizing safety and restoration of gas and electricity.\n\n\"It's important to remember that the cause has yet to be determined,\" he added.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSelsky reported from Salem, Oregon.

It's a different technology than today's controversial \"genetically modified\" foods, more like faster breeding that promises to boost nutrition, spur crop growth, and make farm animals hardier and fruits and vegetables last longer.\n\nThe U.S. National Academy of Sciences has declared gene editing one of the breakthroughs needed to improve food production so the world can feed billions more people amid a changing climate. Yet governments are wrestling with how to regulate this powerful new tool. And after years of confusion and rancor, will shoppers accept gene-edited foods or view them as GMOs in disguise?\n\n\"If the consumer sees the benefit, I think they'll embrace the products and worry less about the technology,\" said Dan Voytas, a University of Minnesota professor and chief science officer for Calyxt Inc., which edited soybeans to make the oil heart-healthy.\n\nResearchers are pursuing more ambitious changes: Wheat with triple the usual fiber, or that's low in gluten. Mushrooms that don't brown, and better-producing tomatoes. Drought-tolerant corn, and rice that no longer absorbs soil pollution as it grows. Dairy cows that don't need to undergo painful de-horning, and pigs immune to a dangerous virus that can sweep through herds.\n\nScientists even hope gene editing eventually could save species from being wiped out by devastating diseases like citrus greening, a so far unstoppable infection that's destroying Florida's famed oranges.\n\nFirst they must find genes that could make a new generation of trees immune.\n\n\"If we can go in and edit the gene, change the DNA sequence ever so slightly by one or two letters, potentially we'd have a way to defeat this disease,\" said Fred Gmitter, a geneticist at the University of Florida Citrus Research and Education Center, as he examined diseased trees in a grove near Fort Meade.\n\nGENETICALLY MODIFIED OR EDITED, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?\n\nFarmers have long genetically manipulated crops and animals by selectively breeding to get offspring with certain traits. It's time-consuming and can bring trade-offs. Modern tomatoes, for example, are larger than their pea-sized wild ancestor, but the generations of cross-breeding made them more fragile and altered their nutrients.\n\nGMOs, or genetically modified organisms, are plants or animals that were mixed with another species' DNA to introduce a specific trait \u2014 meaning they're \"transgenic.\" Best known are corn and soybeans mixed with bacterial genes for built-in resistance to pests or weed killers.\n\nDespite international scientific consensus that GMOs are safe to eat, some people remain wary and there is concern they could spur herbicide-resistant weeds.\n\nNow gene-editing tools, with names like CRISPR and TALENs, promise to alter foods more precisely, and at less cost, without necessarily adding foreign DNA. Instead, they act like molecular scissors to alter the letters of an organism's own genetic alphabet.\n\nThe technology can insert new DNA, but most products in development so far switch off a gene, according to University of Missouri professor Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes.\n\nThose new Calyxt soybeans? Voytas' team inactivated two genes so the beans produce oil with no heart-damaging trans fat and that shares the famed health profile of olive oil without its distinct taste.\n\nThe hornless calves? Most dairy Holsteins grow horns that are removed for the safety of farmers and other cows. Recombinetics Inc. swapped part of the gene that makes dairy cows grow horns with the DNA instructions from naturally hornless Angus beef cattle.\n\n\"Precision breeding,\" is how animal geneticist Alison Van Eenennaam of the University of California, Davis, explains it. \"This isn't going to replace traditional breeding,\" but make it easier to add one more trait.\n\nRULES AREN'T CLEAR\n\nThe Agriculture Department says extra rules aren't needed for \"plants that could otherwise have been developed through traditional breeding,\" clearing the way for development of about two dozen gene-edited crops so far.\n\nIn contrast, the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 proposed tighter, drug-like restrictions on gene-edited animals. It promises guidance sometime next year on exactly how it will proceed.\n\nBecause of trade, international regulations are \"the most important factor in whether genome editing technologies are commercialized,\" USDA's Paul Spencer told a meeting of agriculture economists.\n\nEurope's highest court ruled last summer that existing European curbs on the sale of transgenic GMOs should apply to gene-edited foods, too.\n\nBut at the World Trade Organization this month, the U.S. joined 12 nations including Australia, Canada, Argentina and Brazil in urging other countries to adopt internationally consistent, science-based rules for gene-edited agriculture.\n\nARE THESE FOODS SAFE?\n\nThe biggest concern is what are called off-target edits, unintended changes to DNA that could affect a crop's nutritional value or an animal's health, said Jennifer Kuzma of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University.\n\nScientists are looking for any signs of problems. Take the hornless calves munching in a UC-Davis field. One is female and once it begins producing milk, Van Eenennaam will test how similar that milk's fat and protein composition is to milk from unaltered cows.\n\n\"We're kind of being overly cautious,\" she said, noting that if eating beef from naturally hornless Angus cattle is fine, milk from edited Holsteins should be, too.\n\nBut to Kuzma, companies will have to be up-front about how these new foods were made and the evidence that they're healthy. She wants regulators to decide case-by-case which changes are no big deal, and which might need more scrutiny.\n\n\"Most gene-edited plants and animals are probably going to be just fine to eat. But you're only going to do yourself a disservice in the long run if you hide behind the terminology,\" Kuzma said.\n\nAVOIDING A BACKLASH\n\nUncertainty about regulatory and consumer reaction is creating some strange bedfellows. An industry-backed group of food makers and farmers asked university researchers and consumer advocates to help craft guidelines for \"responsible use\" of gene editing in the food supply.\n\n\"Clearly this coalition is in existence because of some of the battle scars from the GMO debates, there's no question about that,\" said Greg Jaffe of the food-safety watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest, who agreed to join the Center for Food Integrity's guidelines group. \"There's clearly going to be questions raised about this technology.\"\n\nSUSTAINABILITY OR HYPE?\n\nGene-editing can't do everything, cautioned Calyxt's Voytas. There are limitations to how much foods could be changed. Sure, scientists made wheat containing less gluten, but it's unlikely to ever be totally gluten-free for people who can't digest that protein, for example \u2014 or to make, say, allergy-free peanuts.\n\nNor is it clear how easily companies will be able to edit different kinds of food, key to their profit.\n\nDespite her concerns about adequate regulation, Kuzma expects about 20 gene-edited crops to hit the U.S. market over five years \u2014 and she notes that scientists also are exploring changes to crops, like cassava, that are important in the poorest countries.\n\n\"We think it's going to really revolutionize the industry,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

But the scope of the contemplated changes is far broader, as Trump gears up for a wave of Democratic oversight requests and to devote more effort to his own re-election campaign.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the situation, Trump is also discussing replacing Kelly with Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been credited with bringing order and process to a chaotic West Wing, but he has fallen out of favor with the president as well as presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAyers, a seasoned campaign operative, would restore a political-mindset to the role, but he faces stiff opposition from some corners of the West Wing, with some aides lobbying Trump directly against the move.\n\nOther changes are afoot, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are being discussed for replacement. And in an extraordinary move Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump's office called publicly for the firing of Trump's deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel.\n\nFor all of the talk of churn, Trump often expresses frustration with aides and then does not take action. Talk of Kelly's exit has percolated for months and he remains in place.\n\nNielsen had hoped to complete one year in the job and leave in December, but it appeared unlikely she would last that long, said two sources. Both people who had knowledge of the debate spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCurbing illegal immigration is Trump's signature issue \u2014 and one he returns to as a way to rally his most loyal supporters.\n\nBut anyone who takes over at Homeland Security is likely to run up against the same problems that Nielsen faced. The administration has already tried to clamp down at the border but those efforts have been largely thwarted or watered down due to legal challenges.\n\nTrump also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe. And he told those close to him that he felt, at times, that her loyalty was more toward her longtime mentor \u2014 Kelly \u2014 than to the president.\n\nZinke, who faces several ethics investigations, said in interview with The Associated Press on Monday that he has spoken in recent days with Trump, Pence and Kelly about probes into his leadership and they remain supportive. He denied any wrongdoing.\n\nRoss addressed turnover rumors at a Yahoo! Finance summit Tuesday, saying he was in the post to give back to the country and support Trump.\n\n\"I worked very hard to get President Trump elected,\" he said. \"Now I'd like to work equally hard to have him succeed and be re-elected.\"\n\nQuestions about Nielsen's job security are not new. Earlier this year, she pushed back on a New York Times report that she drafted a resignation letter but did not submit it, after Trump scolded her at a Cabinet meeting.\n\nNielsen has led the sprawling post-9/11 federal agency since December. She had been chief of staff to Kelly when he was Trump's first Homeland Security secretary. A DHS spokesman would not comment on whether she was leaving.\n\n\"The secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the president's security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\" spokesman Tyler Houlton said.\n\nNielsen advocated for strong cybersecurity defense, and often said she believed the next terror major attack would occur online \u2014 not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following interference by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nShe pushed Trump's immigration policies, including funding for his border wall and defended the administration's practice of separating children from parents, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens \"in the United States every day.\" But she was also instrumental in stopping the separations.\n\nJust last week, the administration announced that migrants would be denied asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border if they crossed illegally, creating regulations that circumvent immigration laws stating anyone can claim asylum no matter how they arrive to the country. The decision would affect about 70,000 people annually and was immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNielsen also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families and they are at capacity.\n\nShe got into heated discussions with Trump and White House aides several times over immigration policy, as she sought to explain the complicated legal challenges behind immigration law and pushed for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIt's unclear who would replace her. The job requires Senate confirmation and there is no deputy secretary. Under Secretary for Management Claire Grady would be the acting head if Nielsen left.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press Writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Amazon ends suspense over HQ by picking New York, DC suburb", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

So the 20 finalists dangled tax incentives, showcased their workforce and even signed nondisclosure agreements to keep the process secret \u2014 doing whatever it would take to woo the company.\n\nIn the end, Amazon decided to go with a safe bet. On Tuesday, it announced that it had picked for its new East Coast headquarters the buzzy New York neighborhood of Long Island City, Queens as well as a suburb of Washington, in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nAmazon could have chosen a city looking to be revitalized, like Newark, New Jersey. Instead, it opted to be close to two of the nation's centers of power. Both are waterfront communities away from overcrowded business districts, giving Amazon space to grow.\n\nThe reason Amazon gave: they are best suited to attract the high-skilled workers the company wants. The two sites will each get 25,000 jobs that Amazon said will pay an average of $150,000 a year.\n\nThe company will receive more than $2 billion in tax credits and other incentives. New York is forking over more than $1.5 billion, while Virginia and Arlington are offering about a third of that \u2014 $573 million. The hope is that Amazon will attract other companies and ultimately boost the local economies. But while many see it as an opportunity, not everyone is sold on the idea.\n\n\"Offering massive corporate welfare from scarce public resources to one of the wealthiest corporations in the world at a time of great need in our state is just wrong,\" said New York State Sen. Michael Gianaris and New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, Democrats who represent the Long Island City area, in a joint statement.\n\nAmazon, which started as an online bookstore two decades ago, has grown to a behemoth that had nearly $180 billion in revenue last year. It now owns well-known brands, including grocer Whole Foods and online shoe-seller Zappos. It also makes movies and TV shows, runs an advertising business and offers cloud computing services to corporations and government agencies.\n\nThe company has more than 610,000 employees worldwide, making it the second largest U.S.-based, publicly-traded employer behind Walmart.\n\nBut it was the prospect of 50,000 jobs that led 238 communities across North America to pitch Amazon on why they should be home to the next headquarters.\n\nNew York is the nation's financial and media powerhouse and has been working to attract technology companies. Google already has more than 7,000 workers in the city and, according to media reports, is looking to add 12,000 more in coming years.\n\nArlington is directly across the Potomac River from Washington. Large government contractors have offices and lobbying operations there. However, many of its 1980s-era office buildings have vacancies after thousands of federal employees moved elsewhere. Being near the nation's capital could help Amazon with lobbying efforts as the company faces rising scrutiny from politicians.\n\nAmazon said it will spend $5 billion between both locations on construction and other projects.\n\nThe new outposts won't appear overnight. Amazon said hiring at the two headquarters will start next year, but it could take a decade or more to build out its offices.\n\nIts New York location will be in a neighborhood of Queens that sits directly across from midtown Manhattan. Once a bustling factory and freight-moving area, many of Long Island City's plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing left New York. The empty warehouses drew artists looking for affordable rents and businesses followed. Today, the neighborhood is made up of expensive, high-rise condos, with many more under construction.\n\nAmazon's Virginia offices will be in a part of Arlington that local politicians and Amazon are calling National Landing, an area around Reagan National Airport that encompasses Crystal City and Potomac Yard. Large parts are made up of vacant '70s and '80s-era office buildings. Among other challenges, Crystal City has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Adam Ebbin, a Democrat who represents the area where Amazon's new headquarters will be located, said that affordable housing may become an issue, but the announcement is a welcome development that will help increase the area's tax base to help ease overcrowding in schools and address other pressing needs.\n\n\"I would say it's a double-edged sword,\" said Margo Williams, who lives in nearby Alexandria, Virginia. She said more workers in the area would increase tax revenues and bring better services for the community, but she worries traffic could get worse and the Metro more crowded.\n\nAmazon said it will refer to the new locations as headquarters, even though with 25,000 jobs each, they would have fewer workers than its Seattle hometown , which houses more than 45,000 employees.\n\nSeattle will remain one of Amazon's three headquarters, and the company said that senior executives will also be based in the two new locations. It plans to hold company-wide events at the new locations, including shareholder meetings.\n\nThere were early signs that Amazon had its sights set on New York and northern Virginia. Among its 20 finalists, the company had selected two locations in the New York metro area and three in the D.C. area. Plus, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos has a home in Washington D.C., and he personally owns The Washington Post newspaper.\n\nWhile it didn't win the main prize, Nashville, Tennessee, won't go empty handed. Amazon said the finalist city will be home to a new Amazon office with 5,000 jobs, focused on customer delivery and supply chain. Those jobs will also be paid an average of $150,000 a year, Amazon said.\n\n\"You know, this is a huge win,\" said Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. \"When we got this news, I think all of us were really, really excited about it.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia, Matthew Barakat in Arlington County, Virginia, Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, and Karen Matthews in New York contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "NTSB to probe fatal engine failure on Southwest flight", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The National Transportation Safety Board hearing Wednesday in Washington, D.C., is expecte\u2026 [+576 chars]", "fulltext": "There was a loud bang, and suddenly the Southwest Airlines jet rolled sharply to the left. Smoke began to fill the cabin, and flight attendants rushed row by row to make sure all passengers could get oxygen from their masks.\n\nWhen flight attendant Rachel Fernheimer got to row 14, she saw a woman strapped in her lap belt but with her head, torso and arm hanging out a broken window.\n\nFernheimer grabbed one of the woman's legs while flight attendant Seanique Mallory grabbed her lower body. They described being unable to bring the woman back in the plane until two male passengers stepped in to help.\n\nThe harrowing details from the April 17 fatal flight were released for the first time as the National Transportation Safety Board began a hearing Wednesday into the engine failure on Southwest Flight 1380, which carried 144 passengers and five crew members.\n\nThe flight attendants told investigators at least one of the male passengers put his arm out of the window and wrapped it around the woman's shoulder to help pull her back in. Fernheimer said when she looked out the window, she could see that one of the plane's engines was shattered, and there was blood on the outside of the aircraft.\n\nFlight attendants asked for medical volunteers. A paramedic laid the woman across a row of seats and began chest compressions. They tried a defibrillator but it indicated that there was no shock. The paramedic and a nurse took turns at CPR.\n\nPassengers asked if they were going to die. Fernheimer said she squeezed their hands. \"She told them that they were going to make it,\" an investigator wrote.\n\nPilots Tammie Jo Shults and Darren Ellisor landed the crippled Boeing 737 in Philadelphia. The passenger in the window seat, Jennifer Riordan, was fatally injured \u2014 the first death on a U.S. airline flight since 2009. Eight other passengers, including at least one of the men who helped pull Riordan back in the window, suffered minor injuries.\n\nWednesday's hearing in Washington focused on design and inspection of fan blades on the engine, made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran S.A.\n\nAn official from CFM defended the design and testing of fan blades like the one that snapped on the Southwest plane as it flew high above Pennsylvania, triggering an engine breakup that flung debris like shrapnel into the plane.\n\nAfter the fatal accident, CFM recommended the use of frequent and more sophisticated tests using ultrasound or electrical currents.\n\nAnother Southwest jet had suffered a similar blade-related engine breakup in 2016 over Florida.\n\nCFM and federal regulators considered the Florida incident an aberration.\n\n\"We determined early that we would require some corrective action in that it was an unsafe condition,\" an FAA expert on engines, Christopher Spinney, testified on Wednesday, \"but we also determined we had some time.\"\n\nRather than order immediate inspections of fan blades after the 2016 incident, the FAA began a slower process for drafting a regulation and getting public comment before enacting it. That process was still underway when the fatal accident occurred nearly two years later.\n\nSince the deadly flight, widespread inspections have turned up eight other fan blades on similar CFM engines that also had cracks. The fan blade that broke was last inspected six years earlier and, it was determined, suffered from metal fatigue even then \u2014 but it went unnoticed by a less sophisticated exam used at the time.\n\nFan blades have been thought to have no real lifetime limit. CFM and FAA officials said they were now considering whether blades must be replaced at some point even if they don't show wear.\n\nRepresentatives from CFM also testified about testing and certification of jet engines, which are supposed to be built to prevent pieces from breaking off and flying free.\n\nThe investigation is continuing. Most of Wednesday's hearing was highly technical. It was led by one of the safety board's five members, Bella Dinh-Zarr. The full board is expected to determine a probable cause for the accident in the next several months.\n\nMeanwhile, Riordan's husband, Michael, said in a statement on behalf of his family that they were \"grateful for the heroic actions of the passengers who tried to save Jennifer's life.\"\n\n\"The most important thing now is making sure that the aircraft and engine failures that caused Jennifer's untimely and unnecessary death never happen again,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "BTS's agency apologizes over band member's A-bomb shirt", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki before Tokyo's surrender.\n\nBefore its division into North and South Korea after the liberation, the Korean Peninsula was colonized by Japan from 1910-1945. Many in both Koreas still harbor strong resentment against the Japanese colonial masters. But in South Korea, it's extremely rare for anyone to publicly celebrate or mock the atomic bombings. The atomic bombings killed more than 200,000 people in Japan. A South Korean government estimate says about 40,000 of the dead were Koreans, while a victims' group put the Korean death toll at 50,000, many forcefully mobilized as laborers by Japan.\n\nSouth Korean politicians criticized the Japanese broadcasters' decisions to cancel BTS appearances, accusing Japan of harboring \"self-centered views on history\" and letting politics interfere with cultural exchanges.\n\nIt doesn't appear the T-shirt controversy is seriously affecting the band's huge popularity in Japan, with 50,000 people reportedly filling up the Tokyo Dome to watch their performance Wednesday evening after a similar reception on Tuesday.\n\nThe BTS agency said the A-bomb shirt's wearing was \"in no way intentional\" and that it wasn't designed to \"injure or make light of those affected by the use of atomic weapons.\" It said it still apologizes for \"failing to take the precautions that could have prevented the wearing of such clothing by our artist.\"\n\nRegarding the hat furor, it said all apparel and accessories used for the photo book were provided by a media company involved in its publication.

At 19, she won a pageant organized by her hometown's baseball team and became a goodwill ambassador for the squad.\n\nBut Diaz's career changed course in her twenties as she moved to Panama and then Mexico for modeling jobs, which are now scarce in crisis-wracked Venezuela. Three years ago she settled down in Chile, where most of her family has also relocated.\n\n\"I represent the new Chile,\" the 26-year-old said as she was training at a local gym in Santiago for the upcoming competition. \"This is an inclusive country where immigrants come in search of opportunities.\"\n\nAs thousands of people leave Venezuela each day to escape food shortages and an inflation rate that is expected to surpass 1 million percent, dozens of would-be beauty queens are also taking flight and finding work as models and media personalities overseas.\n\nSome are even representing their adopted homelands in international beauty pageants.\n\nNext month, Portugal will be represented at the Miss World competition in China by a former Miss Venezuela participant. And the recently concluded Miss Earth Contest, held in the Philippines, featured two Venezuelan models who competed on behalf of Peru and Spain.\n\n\"My dream of being a beauty queen was not going to stop just because I arrived in a new country,\" said Jessica Russo, who represented Peru in Miss Earth, just a year after moving to that country.\n\nShe failed to make it into the finals but said she will now train for more pageants, where she hopes to win a crown for Peru, the country where her mother was born.\n\n\"I'm still young,\" said the 22-year-old. \"And I want to be a global spokeswoman for good causes.\"\n\nBeauty pageants are followed almost as closely as baseball in Venezuela, which has long been obsessed with glamour and good looks. The South American country is a world leader in international pageants, with seven Miss Universe crowns and six Miss World titles.\n\nWhile critics have described the pageants as misogynous and antiquated, they are defended by many Venezuelans who say the events have helped hundreds of women from all social classes launch careers as models, actresses, TV hosts and news presenters. One former Miss Venezuela winner even served as a mayor of a district in Caracas and ran \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 for the country's presidency.\n\nBut as Venezuela's economy plunges, the country's many pageants no longer offer a direct path to employment. Live fashion shows have ground to a halt, TV productions have slowed down and companies such as fashion brands increasingly refrain from spending money on advertisements.\n\nGiselle Reyes runs four modeling schools for young women in Venezuela that she touts as the \"university of beauty.\" She estimates around 70 percent of her graduates have left the country over the past decade to seek modeling jobs in Mexico, Colombia, the United States and other countries.\n\n\"I even have a tough time finding modeling instructors now,\" Reyes said at a studio in Caracas that is lined with photos of celebrity Venezuelan pageant winners. \"People always tell me they will work for me for a few months while they find a way to leave the country.\"\n\nEven Venezuela's most competitive beauty pageant no longer seems to guarantee its graduates a job in their own country.\n\nThe nationally televised Miss Venezuela contest chooses 24 participants each year and puts them through a grueling six-month academy that includes daily gym routines, modeling lessons and pep talks from instructors who sometimes coax their pupils into having plastic surgery.\n\nBut at least 17 members of the Miss Venezuela class of 2015 appear to be working abroad in Mexico, Colombia, Turkey and even as far away as India, according to a web search of their social media profiles. The number of 2014 contestants working overseas is similar.\n\n\"In the '90s, participating in Miss Venezuela virtually guaranteed you work in modeling or in TV,\" said Rafael Briceno, a Caracas-based radio host who has given public speaking classes to dozens of Miss Venezuela participants. \"Now the local market for models is very small.\"\n\nMany of the Venezuelan beauty queens who have gone abroad credit their rigid preparation in Venezuela with helping them to succeed. But they also are relieved to be free of the demanding, cookie-cutter beauty standards imposed by pageant organizers at home.\n\nDiaz said that while she was still living in Venezuela, she went to a skin cleansing session that went wrong and left small scars and reddish blotches on both her cheeks. Modeling agencies in Venezuela then started to reject her.\n\nIn Chile, Diaz was able to win the national beauty contest despite the rashes, which can be easily hidden with makeup.

Crying on the plane leaving Washington on Inauguration Day 2017, she explained, had nothing to do with Trump.\n\n\"When I got on the plane, I sobbed for 30 minutes,\" she said. \"I think it was just the release of eight years trying to do everything perfectly.\"\n\nObama turned to her husband, who had just become a former president. \"I said to Barack, 'That was so hard, what we just did.

As she does in her book, she recounted Tuesday being raised in a family that struggled economically \u2014 but with parents who encouraged her to be successful.\n\nWhen she was a child, she said her dad would complain to her mother that she wasn't teaching her children how to wash socks, because he had had so few socks growing up that he had to wash them and dry them on a radiator himself.\n\n\"My mom said, 'I'm not teaching them how to wash their socks. I'm going to teach them to go to college, so they can buy a washing machine,'\" Obama said Tuesday.\n\nShe also talked about learning how to play the piano on a rickety one and her surprise at seeing her first piano that was in good condition.\n\n\"You mean there are perfect pianos out there?\" she recalled thinking. \"I didn't even know about it.\"\n\nThe memoir, officially released Tuesday, is already a best-seller.

Protectionism and anti-globalization sentiments are on the rise. This can have a devastating impact on the regional as well as the global economy, and business confidence in Asia is already being affected,\" Lee said.\n\n\"It's important that we redouble our economic integration efforts and maintain a free, open and rules-based multilateral trading system which has underpinned our growth and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nTrump withdrew from a Pacific Rim trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, just after taking office last year. That trade pact is due to take effect on Dec. 30. The U.S. is not part of the RCEP initiative, which includes China, India, Australia and most other Asian economies.\n\nLee said participating countries had finished seven of 18 chapters in their agreement and shown \"strong political will\" to finish it. He warned that further delays in reaching an agreement, already in negotiations for six years, would damage the RCEP's credibility.\n\n\"We are now at the final stage of negotiations. With a strong momentum generated this year, I am pleased to note that the RCEP negotiations are poised for conclusion in 2019,\" he said.\n\nThe 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Earlier Wednesday, the ASEAN leaders met with their counterparts from Australia, China, South Korea, Russia and Japan.\n\nManaging conflict in the South China Sea is a perennial concern. China is pitted against its smaller neighbors in multiple disputes in the sea over coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves.\n\nWhile in Singapore, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has sought to reassure China's neighbors.\n\n\"We have found the way to properly manage and defuse differences, for example, on the issue of the South China Sea in the past years,\" Li said, adding that the situation was moving toward \"greater stability\" with progress toward a single draft text on a code of conduct in the sea. He reiterated Beijing's hope to have a final agreement within three years.\n\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte said such a code is needed \"at all cost\" to prevent dangerous miscalculations.\n\nThe Philippines softened its earlier harsh criticism of China's assertive moves in the disputed waters after Duterte sought to repair relations with Beijing once he took office in 2016 and sought infrastructure funding, trade and investment from Beijing.\n\nThe region already has a nonbinding \"Declaration of Conduct\" but is working toward a more robust agreement, with China appearing to win support for its calls to ban involvement by outside powers, such as the United States, in maritime disputes.\n\nDuterte cited a risk of \"serious miscalculation\" and potential clashes that could trigger military action based on mutual defense treaties.\n\n\"So you are there, so you are in possession, you have occupied it, but tell us what route we should take, what kind of behavior,\" he said.\n\n\"Everything's been excellent between China and the rest of ASEAN except for the fact that there's friction between the Western nations and China,\" Duterte told reporters as he headed into meetings.\n\nWhile the Singapore meetings were typically focused on cooperation and goodwill, concerns over Myanmar's treatment of its ethnic Rohingya Muslims flared with unusually sharp comments to the country's leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence told Suu Kyi on Wednesday that the situation was inexcusable. He also took aim at Myanmar's arrest and imprisonment of two Reuters journalists.\n\nOn Tuesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed lambasted Suu Kyi for her handling of the crisis that led to mass killings and the exodus of more than 700,000 Rohingya from Buddhist-majority Myanmar since August 2017.\n\nMahathir, whose own country has a Muslim majority, said he told Suu Kyi that as a former political detainee, she should show more compassion.\n\n\"They are actually oppressing these people to the point of, well, killing them, mass killing, and burial in graves dug by the victims and that kind of thing,\" said Mahathir, a 93-year-old political veteran whose own past treatment of dissidents at times drew opprobrium. \"That may be relevant in ancient times, but in modern days, we don't do that kind of thing.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Rain closes some polling venues as Fiji elects new leader", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

That didn't stop the 53-year-old from taking a break from looking after her family to vote for Bainimarama.\n\n\"I have seen what he has been doing over the past four years,\" she said, citing policies such as free bus fares for seniors. \"He will go deeper if he comes again in power.\"\n\nSome voters were reluctant to say who they voted for because of fear of reprisals. \"I don't want to be victimized,\" said Jashneel Kumar, a 24-year-old nurse.\n\nFiji has not allowed the political tensions to take a toll on its vital tourism industry, which promotes the Pacific nation's pristine, sunny beaches and friendly, welcoming people.\n\nGiven the history of coups, political stability was a big issue leading up to the election, as were racial tensions and economic issues.\n\nMany people in the nation of 920,000 seem appreciative of the economic gains they've made under Bainimarama.\n\n\"There are no school fees. Before, I paid a couple hundred for school fees,\" said Mere Rigamoto, a 42-year-old mother of three boys. \"Bainimarama's government is not bad. He's OK.\"\n\nBut Bainimarama has a troubled political history that has contributed to the coup culture. There were rumors he could stage another coup should he lose the election.\n\n\"We're bound to have another coup if he doesn't win,\" said 30-year-old Robert Lum On, a recent university graduate.\n\nFiji became independent from the U.K. in 1970. In 1987, Rabuka staged two racially charged coups to return the country to the hands of indigenous Fijians, who make up about 57 percent of the population, and away from Fijians of Indian descent, who make up 38 percent.\n\nIndo-Fijians have been a major ethnic group in Fiji since colonial times, when the British brought them in to work the sugar cane plantations. Many Indo-Fijians favor Bainimarama, whose new constitution in 2013 removed race quotas from Parliament.\n\n\"Bainimarama's key success has been to establish the name 'Fijian' for all citizens of Fiji,\" said Richard Herr, a professor at Fiji National University who is based in Australia. \"His legislation has made campaigning on race, or even having a racially based party, illegal.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bainimarama accused Rabuka of stoking the flames of racism that continue to divide the nation. But some indigenous Fijians believed Rabuka would help restore their prestige, and liked his promise to bring back the nation's Great Council of Chiefs, which Bainimarama disbanded.\n\nCritics deride Bainimarama as authoritarian, but since forcing himself into power, he has changed his image into that of a stable, legitimate leader. His appeal was bolstered when he assumed the U.N. COP23 presidency in November 2017. In that role, which he holds until December, he shaped Fiji into a pioneer on climate change issues.\n\nWith COP23 as a platform, Fiji inserted small island developing states into the international conversation on climate change. The islands are on the front lines of global warming, rising sea levels and ocean acidification.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji, and Bainimarama reoriented regional alliances toward China. His critics accuse him of selling out the country to the Chinese.\n\nThe Lowy Institute says Fiji received about $360 million in aid from China between 2006 and 2016, putting it behind only Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. China Exim Bank holds 39 percent of Fiji's externally held public debt, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nFiji's relations have since normalized with Australia and New Zealand, but the period of sanctions enabled China to step up its regional influence.\n\nFiji has one of the healthiest economies of the Pacific Islands, and GDP is predicted to grow above 3 percent annually through 2020. Tourism is the bedrock of the economy, accounting for more than 40 percent of GDP.\n\nBainimarama's government takes credit for increasing social services, including free primary and secondary education, free bus fares for seniors, and aid in the aftermath of cyclones. But widespread poverty persists. Bainimarama's opponents vowed to raise the minimum wage, which remains only about $1.25 per hour.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Japan's Shinzo Abe, US VP Mike Pence to visit Australia", "description": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Australia for talks on trade, investment, and the two countries' reconciliation after World War II", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/japans-shinzo-abe-us-vp-mike-pence-visit-59180153", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_eacb3ca08746455aa777a452e02ed38a_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T02:56:16Z", "content": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Australia on Friday for talks on trade, investment, and the two countries' reconciliation after World War II.

Abe will become the first Japanese leader to visit Darwin since the bombing of the northern Australian city by Japanese forces in World War II.\n\nMorrison will then hold meetings with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during the APEC meeting in Port Moresby. Pence will use the northern Australian city of Cairns as his base for those meetings amid concerns over security in Papua New Guinea. It's expected several other APEC leaders will also stay in Cairns.\n\nTrade and investment will be a major focus of Morrison's meetings with Abe, who will use his Darwin trip to also visit Japan's biggest ever foreign investment, the $40 billion Ichthys gas project in which Japanese firm Inpex is the majority shareholder and operator. The project, which pipes offshore gas from the northwest Australian coast to Darwin, began its first shipments of liquefied natural gas to Japan last month.\n\nMorrison said he and Abe would also acknowledge those who served in World War II, in a pointed gesture in the northern port city that was bombed by Japanese forces in 1942, with the loss of 250 lives.\n\n\"Prime Minister Abe's visit is deeply symbolic and significant and it will build on our two countries' strong and enduring friendship as well as our economic, security, community and historical ties,\" Morrison said in a statement.\n\nThe meeting comes at a time when a key topic for Australia, its second-largest trading partner Japan and other Asian and South Pacific neighbors is how to respond to the growing influence of China, Australia's biggest trading partner.\n\nAustralia and Japan are expected to reach agreement in Darwin to facilitate larger and more regular joint military exercises, part of a strengthening of defense and economic ties amid growing uncertainty about American involvement in Asia under the Trump administration.\n\nNegotiations began in 2014 for the Reciprocal Access Agreement, which would make it easier for Japanese and Australian forces to visit either country with equipment for military exercises.\n\nAn official from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Australian Financial Review newspaper this week that the two countries were \"at the final stage in discussions\" on the agreement, set to become the first pact on visiting forces Tokyo has signed outside of its arrangement with the U.S.\n\nJapan is also expected to welcome Australia's new foreign policy shift toward the southwest Pacific announced last week. Canberra will set up a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.4 billion) fund to support infrastructure projects in the region, which fits with Japan's call for alternative sources of investment to China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nMorrison will also meet Pence in Port Moresby, where the vice president is expected to deliver a speech at the APEC CEO Summit on Saturday morning continuing Washington's push against China's growing influence. Pence is due to talk just minutes after an address to the forum by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Morrison will also address the gathering\n\nAs the U.S. trade war with China continues, Pence is expected to maintain a hard line against Beijing, following a speech he delivered last month accusing China of stealing U.S. intellectual property, meddling in American elections and suppressing human rights.\n\nPence is also expected to increase pressure on China over its militarization of the disputed South China Sea, the need to maintain pressure on North Korea to denuclearize and on the fight against terrorism.\n\nPence's press secretary Alyssa Farah said he would \"deliver the message that authoritarianism, aggression, and the disregard for other nations' sovereignty by any nation in the Indo-Pacific will not be tolerated by the United States.\"\n\nThe vice president is also expected to set out Washington's rival vision for the Indo-Pacific, promoting private investment over state-controlled funding to build regional infrastructure, in reaction to Chinese involvement in the South Pacific in recent years.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Washington Post last weekend, Pence wrote: \"The United States will work with like-minded nations \u2014 from India to the Pacific islands \u2014 to advance our shared interests. Together, we will stand up to anyone who threatens our interests and our values. The United States seeks collaboration, not control.\"\n\nAustralia will show off a heavy military presence around the APEC meeting to maintain security including a helicopter-landing ship, fighter jets and 500 troops to be stationed in Port Moresby.\n\nThe U.S., Japan, China, Canada, New Zealand and Indonesia are also contributing to security arrangements."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Jeffrey Cook", "title": "Georgia's next governor remains unclear as Abrams scraps for votes", "description": "Battles in the courtroom and protests at the state capitol underscore the bitter turmoil plaguing Gerogia's gubernatorial election.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgias-governor-remains-unclear-abrams-scraps-votes/story?id=59166302", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/abrams-kemp-rt-ap-er-181031_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T02:47:59Z", "content": "Battles in the courtroom and protests at the state capitol underscore the bitter turmoil plaguing Georgia's gubernatorial election.

His factory churns out tons of cookies, crackers, candies and bakery goods, plus dozens of varieties of soft drinks sold around the country. In its showroom, Kwon Yong Chol proudly showed off one of his best-sellers, a nutrient soup made with spirulina, a blue-green microalgae \"superfood.\"\n\n\"Ever since construction began everyone here had wanted the leader to visit, and this year he did. His visit was the biggest thing that could happen to us,\" Kwon, smiling broadly, said of Kim Jong Un's visit in July. \"He ate our instant noodles. He said they were delicious.\"\n\nNot all managers have been so fortunate.\n\nThere's a lot on the line for North Korea these days. And Kim means business.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThough the international spotlight has been on his denuclearization talks with Washington, the North Korean leader has a lot riding domestically on his promises to boost the country's economy and standard of living. His announcement in April that North Korea had sufficiently developed its nuclear weapons and would now focus on building its economy marked a sharp turn in official policy, setting the stage for his rapid-fire meetings with the leaders of China, South Korea and the United States.\n\nIt also set in motion an ambitious campaign of \"on-the-spot guidance\" trips to rally party officials, factory managers and military troops.\n\nAfter the announcement of the \"new strategic line\" and his first round of summits, including his meeting in June with President Donald Trump, Kim embarked on nearly 20 inspection tours around the country in July and another 10 in August, all but one of them to non-military locations. The military inspection rounds are instead being handled by the country's premier, Pak Pong Ju, who has gone on 18 inspection tours from July, mostly to military facilities.\n\nOn-the-spot guidance tours are a tradition Kim inherited from his father and grandfather, the late \"eternal General-Secretary\" Kim Jong Il and \"eternal President\" Kim Il Sung.\n\nThey date to the late 1940s, when Kim Il Sung began gradually institutionalizing the visits to demonstrate his hands-on leadership and, as invariably portrayed by the North's media, his deep care and concern for the well-being of the people.\n\nFactories, farms and important industrial facilities are the usual destinations. But Kim Jong Un's focus on them this year marks a break from excursions in 2017 to nuclear weapons facilities and missile sites.\n\nReflecting the gravity of his current mission, Kim has shown little patience for cadres who come up short.\n\nOn his July tour in the northern part of the country he lambasted officials at a factory that produces backpacks for students, saying their attitude was \"very wrong\" and \"has no revolutionary spirit.\" He then dressed down officials at a power plant that has been under construction for 17 years, criticized people in charge of a hotel project for taking too long to finish plastering its walls and slammed the authorities responsible for building a recreational campsite.\n\n\"Looking round the bathroom of the camp, he pointed out its very bad condition, saying bathtubs for hot spring therapy are dirty, gloomy and unsanitary for their poor management,\" said an official report of the visit.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMost inspection tours, however, go like Kim's two-hour visit to the Songdowon processed foods factory.\n\nWith a gaggle of cameramen in tow \u2014 the tours are always top news in North Korea's media \u2014 the site's senior manager generally serves as the guide. Members of Kim's entourage frantically take notes as he suggests tweaks of this or that and offers praise or encouragement.\n\nMany factories put up red and gold plaques to commemorate the event. Some have special wall displays made afterward that show the exact path the leader took in little LED lights that can be turned on at the press of a button.\n\nAt Kwon's factory, which has 300 employees and is located on the outskirts of the eastern coastal city of Wonsan, Kim advised managers to improve operations on an \"automated, unmanned and germ-free basis, holding aloft the banner of self-reliance.\"\n\nBefore the obligatory group photo session, the North's official news agency reported, Kim voiced \"his expectation and conviction\" the factory would produce more quality foods \"and thus more fully demonstrate the honor of being a factory loved by the people.\"\n\nBut Kim also had a broader point to make.\n\nHe told the factory management that they must be prepared to work in a more competitive environment, to modernize and cut the fat. These are special times and they, and basically all managers throughout the country, need to step up their game.\n\n\"The Respected Marshal Kim Jong Un pays much more attention to the quality of a product,\" Kwon said. \"When he came to this factory he gave instructions to maintain a high level of hygiene because food is closely associated with the health of the people, and to keep the highest level of quality of products that people like. He said we must produce products that are world class, and produce a lot of foods that people like.\"\n\nKwon said the pressure isn't just coming from above.\n\n\"The people demand more quality,\" he said. \"When people look at the product, they must feel like they want to have it. So we are designing things in line with that. We have to satisfy the demands of the people.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTalmadge is the AP's Pyongyang bureau chief.

Reporter: First lady Melania trump, asserting herself like never before in the west wing, today publically called for deputy national security advisor Mira ricardel to be fired. \"It is the position of the office of the first lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this white house,\" Mrs. Trump's spokeswoman said in a statement. That came less than an hour after ricardel was seen smiling right over the president's shoulder at a west wing event. White house sources tell ABC news the first lady became irritated with ricardel in the planning of her trip to Africa last month. Mrs. Trump felt she had treated her staff disrespectfully. On that trip, the first lady told ABC's Tom llamas there are some on the president's team she does not trust, and that she lets him know. It's very difficult sometimes because I'm so busy with my -- my office, I don't get involved with west wing. Do you think there's still people there that he can't trust? Yes. Still working now? Yes. Reporter: Tonight, the first lady is very publicly getting involved. But as of now, Mira ricardel still has a job. Jon Karl with us tonight live from the white house.

When he got there, he found that the home was one of the few spared by the Camp Fire.\n\n\"We expected to find the remains of his dad,\" Hill said. \"The house was still standing, and his dad made it out alive.\"\n\nAs Hill and a friend walked up to the home, they noticed a mule pacing back and forth. They went over to the animal to see if it was OK and make sure it hadn't been burned when they saw another mule lying in the pool in the backyard.\n\nCourtesy Jeff Hill\n\nThe mule, who was trapped in the pool cover, looked as if she had given up and \"had the look of defeat in her eyes,\" Hill said.\n\n\"There\u2019s no telling how long she was there but she was shivering uncontrollably and ultimately lost her fight,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"She was all caught up in the pool cover but her being suspended by it prevented her from drowning.\"\n\nWhen Hill and his friend, fellow Butte County resident Geoff Shelden, cut the straps of the pool cover, the mule was so exhausted that she went under water. The two men then floated her to the shallow end of the pool so she could stand up, put a chain around her neck and walked her up the stairs, Hill said.\n\nThe mule shook off the water, stood \"shoulder-to-shoulder\" with her rescuers and appeared to thank them.\n\n\"She came up and put her head in between us, let us love on her a little bit as a thank you,\" Hill said.\n\nCourtesy Jeff Hill\n\nThe mule then turned to walk away, but shot one last glance toward them.\n\n\"As she was walking away, she looked back at us one more time,\" Hill said. \"I felt it was reassurance, saying, 'I'm OK,' and 'Thank you.'\"\n\nThe Butte County community has rallied together in the wake of the devastation wrought by the Camp Fire, Hill said.\n\nHill's childhood home in Paradise, California, was completely wiped out by the inferno. He had lived there a total of about 20 years, having moved back a couple of years ago after his parents renovated it.\n\nThe home's central fireplace is the only structure still standing, before and after photos show.\n\nCourtesy Jeff Hill\n\nCourtesy Jeff Hill\n\nHill was at work at the Paradise Irrigation District on Thursday when the fire began.\n\n\"I saw the huge plume of smoke. We were all looking at it,\" he said. \"We were thinking, 'Oh gosh. That's really close to us.'\"\n\nHill said the sky got \"darker and darker\" as the fire neared and smoke filled the sky. Once alerts detailing the rapid spread of the fire began going out, he rushed home to grab as many possessions as he could.\n\nWhen he got home, he saw the field behind his home was on fire. It took just 10 minutes for the embers to reach his yard, he said.\n\nCourtesy Jeff Hill\n\nHill, a father to two sons, ages 2 and 4, with another child on the way, grabbed many of his children's mementos, his Rottweiler-Labrador retriever named Tara and got out.\n\n\"The only thing that was on my mind was kids,\" he said. \"Anything that I can grab kid-related, anything that could never be replaced.\"\n\nAs Hill was driving away, he saw his front yard catch fire, he said.\n\nNoah Berger/AP\n\nHill\u2019s law enforcement friends told him later that his house was destroyed.\n\n\"The entire town of Paradise is virtually gone,\" said Hill, who has lived there his whole life. \"The infrastructure is completely lost.\"\n\nHe said he felt \"numb\" when he returned to his home on Saturday to find nothing there.\n\n\"I wanted to cry,\" he said. \"There's just so much going on and so much devastation that I just kind of stood there in silence and just kind of stared for a while.\"\n\nNoah Berger/AP\n\nHowever, his entire family made it out safe, although they now have \"nothing\" in the aftermath of the fire, he said.\n\nHill, who is currently staying with his father in Chico, about 15 miles west of Paradise, has created a GoFundMe campaign called \"Family home lost to Camp Fire.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: US tourist fatally stabbed in apparent robbery in Mexico: Police", "description": "Taylor Meyer's family in California said he was traveling with a large group for a friend's 30th birthday.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/us-tourist-fatally-stabbed-apparent-robbery-mexico-police-59177541", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/181113_wnt_index_american_tourist_killed_mexico_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:21:43Z", "content": "Now Playing: US tourist fatally stabbed in apparent robbery in Mexico: Police Now Playing: Matt Gutman Reporter's Notebook: 'The Boys in the Cave' Now Playing: What is on the Khashoggi killing tape?

A 2017 federal law provided a framework for police to use rapid DNA technology when booking suspects in criminal investigations, and some medical examiners have started using it to identify the dead or are weighing deploying it in disasters.\n\n\"In many circumstances, without rapid DNA technology, it's just such a lengthy process,\" says Frank DePaolo, a deputy commissioner of the New York City medical examiners' office, which has been at the forefront of the science of identifying human remains since 9/11 and is exploring how it might use a rapid DNA device.\n\nThe technology, and DNA itself, has limits. It is sometimes impossible to extract DNA from incinerated remains, and trying to identify remains through DNA requires having a sample from the person when alive or building a profile by sampling close relatives.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there's no hope of identifying the dead without DNA.\n\n\"There's two ways to approach it: You could do a DNA-led identification effort ... (or) more traditionally, the medical examiner and their team of people will try to establish the biological profiles of the unidentified and try to identify them through more traditional methods,\" says Dr. Anthony Falsetti, a George Mason University forensic science professor and forensic anthropologist and a specialist in evaluating human remains.\n\nIn fact, more traditional methods, such as examining dental records, are often a first step. Partially, that's because victims might have dental X-rays but not personal DNA profiles. Other medical records \u2014 of bone fractures, prosthetics or implants, for instance \u2014 also can be helpful.\n\nAnd after a disaster, a crucial part of identifying victims is developing a manifest of the missing people, studying the site for clues as to who might have been there and meticulously searching for remains, sometimes by having a forensic anthropologist sift carefully through the debris, DePaolo said.\n\n\"Ultimately, you may be able to identify that you have a female, a male, a child\" from studying the remains, but science won't give them a name, he said. In such cases, authorities may have to rely on reasoning to match what's known about the remains to who is known to be missing.\n\n\"That manifest may ultimately be the only thing you have to potentially identify that the victims that were recovered from that location could be those victims,\" he said.\n\nNew York medical examiners have worked to match nearly 22,000 fragments of human remains to the 2,753 people killed at the World Trade Center. More than 17 years later, 40 percent of the dead have never had any of their remains identified. But the painstaking process still yields results: The remains of one victim, 26-year-old Scott Michael Johnson, were identified in July for the first time.\n\nWhatever the process proves to be for California authorities, DePaolo said, \"it's a tough and complex job that they have ahead of them, and our condolences go out to them.\""}]
