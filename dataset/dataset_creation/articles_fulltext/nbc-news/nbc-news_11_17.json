Evans, 44, lived in her home in Paradise, California for 19 years. She and her husband, a veteran who relies on his pension as income, were happy there with their three children and nine pets, and they had a great deal on rent \u2014 just $412 a month.\n\n\u201cI never wanted to leave Paradise,\u201d Evans tells NBC News BETTER through tears. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever have to. But now everything is gone.\u201d\n\nEvans and her family (pets included) were able to escape the deadly fires, but lost their home. Right now, they\u2019re staying with a friend in Orland \u2014 in a single room \u2014 and have until the end of the week before they have to find other lodgings \u2014 a transition that Evans breaks into sobs at the mere mention of, because they have nowhere to go.\n\nWith shelters filling up and no insurance payout coming, some residents face long-term displacement\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of us with nowhere to go,\u201d she says. \u201cThe shelters are all full, and the nearest hotels are hours away, and we can\u2019t afford them anyway,\u201d says Evans. \u201cThey\u2019re gouging the prices, and we have so many pets. Rentals are going for $2k a month for two-bedroom apartments.\u201d\n\nAll those who have lost their homes in the fires have been dealt a terrible blow, but lower income renters such as Evans, who did not have renter\u2019s insurance (as of 2016 research by the Insurance Information Institute, only 41 percent of renters did), are faced with a particularly difficult recovery ahead. With no payout from insurance and no land they can rebuild on, many have turned to parking lots for shelter, waiting for help.\n\n\u201cThe [Chico] Walmart is filled with tents. Everyone is just struggling to get through the day. We keep hearing on the news that we have to wait \u2014 wait on FEMA, wait for guidance \u2014 and we keep hearing from people who aren\u2019t [affected] that \u2018it\u2019ll all be okay.\u2019 But they just don\u2019t get it. Our whole town is gone. Our lives have been destroyed and nobody has any answers for us.\u201d\n\nThe housing crisis is severe, with Larry Olmstead, president and CEO of United Way of Northern California highlighting that the homelessness in Butte County and Shasta County was a challenging problem to solve even even before the fires.\n\n\u201cHomelessness is a hot button issue in both communities,\u201d Olmstead says. \u201cSo you start with a fairly slim housing stock, particularly in Chico to begin with, and now [tens of thousands more] people are homeless on top of that. There is no easy way to absorb these people in this housing structure. We're at roughly 80k homes destroyed.\u201d\n\nHomes are lost and jobs may be, too\n\nSome people who lived and worked in Paradise, didn\u2019t just lose their homes \u2014 they may have also lost their jobs.\n\nHeather Milstred, 29, also a former resident of Paradise is staying with a family friend in Shasta Lake who has generously opened her home to her, her boyfriend, their two young daughters, along with other displaced family members and their pets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a job coach for mentally disabled adults with California Vocations, and my boss has been amazing,\u201d Milstred says. \u201cBut our location was leveled. They\u2019re renting out a temporary space, but the [future] is unclear. My [uncle] Jason works at a Save Mart and the building is standing but the town is gone. My [aunt] Robin works at Curves, and the building is there, too, but how do you work in a town where everything else is gone and everyone has left?\u201d\n\nIf you're displaced, register with FEMA and look for these evacuation centers\n\nMichael R. Hart, a spokesperson for FEMA says that the organization is urging people who are trying to get back on their feet to take one of two steps: If they have insurance, file a claim. If they are uninsured or under-insured, set up a case.\n\nIf you're a victim and can make it to a FEMA recovery center, go there, but know that you can also set up a case by calling 800-621-3362 of visiting online disasterassistance.gov.\n\nHart says that there are still evacuation centers accepting people, while others are at capacity. Note that some welcome pets (including large animals as well). See the Butte County, Los Angeles County and Ventura County web sites for up-to-date information on evacuation centers.\n\nWhat we can do now: Cash donations and gift cards\n\nMilstred and Evans emphasize their gratitude for donations of clothing, but right now they have nowhere to store anything non-essential. Getting stuff without a home to put it in, is only adding to the anxiousness of being homeless. Hart adds that clothing donations also create a logistics/manpower issue on the ground.\n\n\u201cMoney is really what would help. We need to put down a deposit on a new place once we find one\u201d says Milstred. \u201cGift cards we can hold on to and use to buy things like towels and blankets when we [get settled] are also helpful.\u201d\n\nDonate to these organizations who are offering immediate assistance\n\nFEMA, a government entity, does not accept donations, but they are working closely with non-profits that are relying on donations. Hart urges people who want to donate to make sure that whichever charity you choose has been approved by National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD).\n\nHere\u2019s a list of some organizations working closely with survivors:\n\nOther ways to help: Volunteer and donate blood\n\nVolunteering in the affected areas is another great way to help.\n\nAnthony C. Tornetta, spokesperson for the Red Cross, reminds us that the Red Cross is 90-percent volunteer based.\n\n\u201cRight now best thing is to go on the Red Cross site and sign up to volunteer,\u201d says Tornetta. \u201cWhatever time you can commit, whether it\u2019s a week or eight hours \u2014 we will welcome your support. Please sign up and call first, as we can\u2019t necessarily stop in the middle of an operation if you just show up.\u201d\n\nTornetta also encourages those wanting to give assistance to donate blood, if able.\n\n\u201cWe have had to cancel blood drives because of wildfires so we can use help there,\u201d he says. \u201cBlood is always needed, no matter what is going on.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Jonathan Allen and Allan Smith", "title": "Gillum officially concedes Florida governor race, congratulates DeSantis", "description": "\"We wanted to make sure that every single vote...as long as it was a legally cast vote, we wanted those votes to be counted,\" Gillum said.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/gillum-officially-concedes-florida-governor-race-congratulates-desantis-winning-n936786", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2641151/181109-andrew-gillum-ew-752p_f07717bd2df82ecee3634d9047c7b64b.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T22:42:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Jonathan Allen and Allan Smith\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Democrat Andrew Gillum conceded the Florida governor's race to Republican Ron DeSantis Saturday, offering his congratulations in a message streamed on Facebook.\n\n\"We wanted to make sure that every single vote ... as long as it was a legally cast vote, we wanted those votes to be counted,\" Gillum said. Meanwhile, counties across the state worked toward a Sunday noon deadline to hand count certain ballots in other races. \"And now that we are rounding that process out R. Jai and I wanted to take a moment to congratulate Mr. DeSantis on becoming the governor of the great state of Florida.\u201d\n\nDeSantis' victory isn't a surprise, but it is very good news for President Donald Trump, whose party \u2014 and a close ally \u2014 will control the state government apparatus for the 2020 election. Florida, which has favored the winning candidate in each of the last six presidential elections, has a long history of razor-thin margins. In 2000, the contest was decided by 537 votes after a recount, and no presidential candidate has won with more than 52.1 percent of the vote here since 1988.\n\nDeSantis responded to a congratulatory tweet from Gillum without mentioning his opponent. \"This was a hard-fought campaign,\" DeSantis wrote in a subtweet. \"Now it's time to bring Florida together.\"\n\nGillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, trailed DeSantis by roughly .41 percent, or a little less than 34,000 votes out of more than 8 million cast after a machine recount conducted earlier this week. That effectively sealed the result of his contest because Gillum would have needed to finish within .25 percent of DeSantis to force a hand recount in their race.\n\nGillum, who would have been Florida's first black governor, originally conceded on Election Day, when it appeared that his deficit would be too large to overcome. But as more votes were tallied, DeSantis' lead was cut to less than .5 percent \u2014 the difference required by Florida law to trigger a machine recount.\n\nAfter he fell within that threshold, Gillum essentially withdrew his concession as he called on Florida to count all the votes before he would make any further announcement.\n\nNBC News had already rated DeSantis as the apparent winner of the race.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who was locked in a tight battle for his seat with Republican Gov. Rick Scott, trailed by about .15 percent after the machine recount. His last hope to reverse the outcome appeared to be dashed Friday when it was revealed that \"under-votes\" in Broward County \u2014 ballots on which electronic readers did not show votes in the Senate race \u2014 were not the result of machine error.\n\nRepublicans such as Scott and Trump have insisted Democrats are trying to \"steal\" the election, with each suggesting that rampant voter fraud could be taking place in key Democratic-leaning Broward and Palm Beach Counties.\n\nNo evidence of such fraud has been brought forth. State election officials said they have not seen any evidence of fraud.\n\nWhile he had tweeted earlier in the week that the election should be immediately called in favor of Scott and DeSantis, Trump wrote on Saturday morning to congratulate Gillum on \"having run a really tough and competitive race.\"\n\nJonathan Allen reported from Florida.

Overstuffed with plot twists and turns and frustratingly obscure in its worldbuilding, the highly anticipated sequel to \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d saunters in with the overconfidence of a mediocre white man, or Johnny Depp. And despite a strong cast and the Harry Potter cachet, it\u2019s sadly one more example of the failed prequel genre pioneered by George Lucas\u2019 \u201cStar Wars\u201d films of the early aughts and cemented by Peter Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d trilogy.\n\nThe problem begins and ends with Warner Brothers thinking it was a good idea to let J.K. Rowling write the scripts. Rowling is a writer of books \u2014 an excellent writer of books \u2014 and not necessarily a writer of screenplays. Yet, after spending 2012 developing \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d with someone else writing the script, she jumped at the idea of writing a movie based on her slim 2001 novel \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.\u201d\n\nOverstuffed with plot twists and turns and frustratingly obscure in its worldbuilding, the highly anticipated sequel to \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d saunters in with the overconfidence of a mediocre white man, or Johnny Depp.\n\nThis was partly to keep control of her own material. (It is much easier to argue about what does and doesn\u2019t happen in your universe if you are the one penning the script.) But there\u2019s also a good reason why scriptwriters exist. Rowling\u2019s book \u201cOrder of the Phoenix\u201d for example, the longest of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books, was adapted for Hollywood by a writer who knew how to take all her subplots and streamline them into a tight film. Some subtext becomes text, a few subplots get referenced, but most get cut.\n\nThe \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series in particular is built around the slow reveal. The surface-level plot of an orphan who gets to go to the most magical school on Earth actually hides a much larger narrative about bigotry, fascism, love and sacrifice that only starts to solidify after several books and several hundred more pages. The first big reveal, which doesn\u2019t come until the end of \u201cPrisoner of Azkaban,\u201d is storytelling at some of its most magical.\n\nMovies don\u2019t have the same luxurious amount of time, at least not giant blockbusters. The first \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movie synopsis promised fans a small-time magical romp with a bumbling magizoologist and a pair of accidentally switched briefcases. What viewers got was a story that barely had time to establish those characters, or check to see if their foundations were solid, before Rowling blew down the wall for the reveal. It could have worked, had the series given the viewers more time to settle in.\n\n\u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d has this same problem. Nominally about the adventures of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and his American pals in Paris, the film again has way too many subplots, asides and backstories. Dumbledore (Jude Law) is plotting his eventual fight with evil genius Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) from the shadows of Hogwarts. Newt\u2019s older brother Theseus (Callum Turner) and his fianc\u00e9 Leta LeStrange (Zoe Kravtiz) worry about Dumbledore secretly being in the pocket of Grindelwald and leading their beloved Newt towards danger.\n\nCredence (Ezra Miller) and his pal Nagini (Claudia Kim) search for Credence\u2019s real mother, who may or may not be Leta\u2019s father\u2019s first wife, while another half-brother Yusuf (William Nadylum) searches for him as well. Nicholas Flamel shows up. Footage from World War II gets played out of what can only be described as a skull hookah. (Apparently Grindelwald\u2019s plot to subjugate and eradicate muggles is in service of stopping the Holocaust.)\n\nBut perhaps the most frustrating part of the whole endeavor is watching a beloved franchise slowly crumble under the weight of unnecessary expectations.\n\nThere are even more subplots but my editor made me cut them because even she was getting confused. The truth is, the best movie hidden away in here is an adorable little romantic comedy of a story, featuring the four stars of the first movie, Newt, Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterson), her sister Queenie (Alison Sodul) and muggle Jacob (Dan Fogelman). It would have cute and fun, and perfectly on trend. Ultimately, though, the plot that wins out is the one that puts Dumbledore and Grindelwald front and center, with an ending that is both shocking and confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the most frustrating part of the whole endeavor is watching a beloved franchise slowly crumble under the weight of unnecessary expectations. It\u2019s as if Rowling was afraid the world she\u2019d built wouldn\u2019t be accepted unless every old character from the books had a cameo, even if their meticulously crafted backstories made such a thing chronologically impossible. She didn\u2019t need to tie every one of these new movies back to her original series every five minutes. Instead of trusting her own universe, it feels like she's now frantically dismantling it.\n\nOne big reason Rowling's \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books are so beloved is that the world they created could support not only her own tale but the imaginations (and fan fiction) of thousands of devoted readers. Why she couldn\u2019t trust it to hold a story about Newt Scamander and his friends without making it about everything else is a mystery no one, not even Dumbledore, can solve."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Samantha Cassetty, RD", "title": "Healthier sides and desserts for your holiday table", "description": "Want to lighten things up without losing that delicious holiday flavor?

To prove that healthy holiday food is anything but drab, I\u2019ve rounded up some better-for-you recipes \u2014 from starters to sides to desserts \u2014 that\u2019ll impress your guests throughout the season. You\u2019ll definitely want to add these great-tasting recipes to your holiday lineup.\n\nSimple Brussels Spout Salad Julie Andrews, MS, RDN, CD, The Gourmet RD\n\nShaved Brussels sprouts are easy to find in supermarkets, and they\u2019re the base of this elegant, easy-to-assemble salad. If you have trouble timing your holiday meals, this is one dish that can be prepared up to two days in advance. Dried cranberries are a festive addition, and sliced almonds add more nutrition and crunch to the mix. After the holidays, feel free to sub other dried fruits and nuts.\n\nButternut Squash Apple Cheddar Soup Chef Julie Harrington, RD, Culinary Nutrition Consultant\n\nStarting a holiday (or any meal) with soup is a strategy that might prevent overdoing it over the next few courses. Studies suggest that soup reduces hunger and promotes feelings of fullness, thereby curbing food intake later on. This soup has all the flavors of the holidays (butternut squash, apples), married with sharp cheddar. Plain Greek yogurt keeps things creamy (and packs in some bonus protein) and helps keep the cheese in check. Of course, there\u2019s no need to pass on this once the holidays are over; save the recipe so you can cozy up to a bowl all winter long.\n\nVegan, Gluten-Free Green Bean Casserole Lindsey Janeiro, RDN, CLT\n\nThis dish is a Thanksgiving classic, but with updated ingredients you and your guests will appreciate. One notable healthy replacement: Gluten-free alternative ground flax seeds thicken the sauce without needing flour. It also happens to supply some fiber. One tradition that stays: Fried onions (because, well, it\u2019s green bean casserole after all!), though the recipe uses much less than the standard version.\n\nGreek Yogurt Mashed Potatoes Lindsey Janeiro, RDN, CLT\n\nEven your most discerning guests are sure to love this healthier version of mashed potatoes. Starting with a base of Yukon gold potatoes makes them extra creamy since this spud has an unmatched luxurious texture. Other swaps include nonfat plain Greek yogurt for full fat sour cream and nonfat milk for heavy cream. Though these mashed potatoes still call for butter (thank goodness!), to keep with the healthy theme, the recipe uses less than others. Fresh herbs are added to boost the flavor and the holiday flair.\n\nThe Best Cornbread Stuffing Ever Monique Volz, Ambitious Kitchen\n\nThe healthfulness of this dish come down to the whole food ingredient list. The base is homemade, gluten-free cornbread \u2014 a step that\u2019s worth the effort for a holiday meal. But if you want to save time, you could always sub with another cornbread or gluten free bread. Once made, the bread is combined with fresh herbs, chopped walnuts, and dried cranberries. The various flavors and textures play well together and make this a holiday dish you\u2019ll remember long after you finish your last bite.\n\nHealthy Cauliflower Latkes for Chanukah Abbey Sharp, RD and blogger at Abbey's Kitchen\n\nYou already know that cauliflower is the master of disguise! Here, it stands in for potatoes to make latkes. This swap cuts the carbs and calories, but the recipe also suggests serving the latkes with unsweetened applesauce instead of the traditional sweetened variety and plain 0% Greek yogurt in place of sour cream. Plus, rather than deep frying the latkes, they\u2019re saut\u00e9ed in a non-stick skillet coated with a spritz of olive oil. Taken together, these recipe swaps will save you carbs, calories and sugar, leaving a little room for another Chanukah tradition: jelly donuts!\n\nSlow Cooker Gingerbread Apple Pie Crumble Jamie Vespa MS, RD\n\nWith a blend of gingerbread spices, apples, and a crispy, crumble topping, this dessert will be at home at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Since it\u2019s made in a slow cooker, you can multi-task, letting it cook (while the aroma fills your kitchen), as you\u2019re making other holiday dishes. Since the crumble is made with ultra-healthy ground flaxseed, whole grain oats and pecans, and because the dish is low in added sugars, you could also serve it for a deliciously low-fuss holiday brunch. As a dessert, you\u2019ll probably want to add a spoonful of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, but if you\u2019re going the brunch route, add a spoonful of Greek yogurt instead. If you skip the toppings or use dairy free alternatives, this crumble is both vegan and gluten free.\n\nHealthy Baked Pears Lindsey Janeiro, RDN, CLT\n\nThis is one holiday dessert that won\u2019t put you in a sugar coma! The blend of spices and the nut-free topping offer the flavor fix of a fruit crumble or pie minus a few hundred calories and the after-dessert bloat \u2014 even with the optional whipped topping or spoonful of ice cream. PS, did I mention it\u2019s healthy, too?\n\nGingerbread Tahini Banana Bread Jamie Vespa MS, RD\n\nThe aroma of gingerbread spices lends holiday cred, while the white whole wheat flour keeps this baked quick bread in the healthy lane. Tahini is a spread (similar to other nut and seed butters) made from ground sesame seeds. It\u2019s a culinary upgrade that supplies protein and fiber, as well as important vitamins and minerals, such as magnesium. It\u2019s so delicious, in addition to using it as an optional drizzle, you might want to consider using it as a spread for this warm, wonderful bread, and you\u2019ll certainly find many other uses for it (say, as a dip for apples) throughout the year.\n\nMORE BETTER-FOR-YOU RECIPES\n\nWant more tips like these?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Elizabeth Chuck\n\nWhen Peter Ellenstein goes out to dinner with his children, who range in age from 17 to 30, the meals are raucous, and there is always a lot of catching up to do \u2014 especially because no one in the family knew each other before last October.\n\nEllenstein, 57, donated sperm anonymously in his 20s and early 30s to make some extra cash, and never expected to meet any of his offspring. But this past year, thanks to online tools, including DNA test kits, he discovered that he has at least 24 biological children. A divorced theater director living in Los Angeles who never raised any kids of his own, Ellenstein has met 20 of them so far. One calls him every day and recently took a three-week trip to Europe with him; others are less involved, but still show up to family dinners, some with the hope that he\u2019ll pick up the check.\n\nWhen Ellenstein first found out about his offspring, \u201cit was just a huge shock,\u201d he said. Fearing the interactions might be awkward or disappointing, he was initially reluctant to meet his children.\n\nNow, though, his life revolves around them \u2014 whether he\u2019s proudly introducing them to his mother or helping them play practical jokes on one another.\n\nPeter Ellenstein, seen here with six of his 24 biological children in May 2018, lets his offspring guide the nature of his relationship with them. \"I don't want to become someone who is a problem in their life,\" he said. Courtesy of Peter Ellenstein\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d he said. \u201cEach kid so far that I\u2019ve met is a whole other adventure and a whole new exciting thing in my life.\u201d\n\nAs more donor-conceived children connect with each other and their biological parents thanks to social media and at-home genetics tests such as 23andMe and Ancestry.com, a new kind of modern family is emerging. The first meeting between half-siblings and sperm donor dads can be fraught, but what follows over the ensuing years may be even more complicated. Some children grow close with their biological fathers and half-siblings, even moving in with them. Others are more hesitant, unsure of how or whether to build a relationship with people whose existence, in some cases, was a family secret.\n\nThe newly formed connections raise delicate questions: Should a sperm donor who didn\u2019t raise his children refer to them as his son or daughter? Should they call him Dad? And how does the introduction of this new blood relative affect existing relationships with the parents and siblings that a person grew up with?\n\nNBC News spoke to more than a dozen sperm donors, donor-conceived children and parents who received sperm donations about what happens when strangers with shared DNA get to know each other. Some donor-conceived children spoke glowingly of spending Father\u2019s Day with their sperm donors. Others described friction with the parents who raised them. One recalled learning in her 30s that she was donor-conceived, which set off panic attacks over her sense of self, even though she and her sperm donor get along well.\n\nAnd for others, the hoped-for relationship never materialized at all.\n\n\"There\u2019s never a dull moment.\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no social script for any of these scenarios,\u201d said Erin Jackson, founder of We Are Donor Conceived, a support group and resource page with more than 650 members on Facebook.\n\nJackson, 38, of San Diego, started the group in 2016 after finding out that she had been donor-conceived. She had tracked down her biological father and sent him a letter, tucking a photo of herself inside. He didn\u2019t write back until two years later, and when he finally did, \u201che basically told me to get lost,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI tried not to get my hopes up, but I was still disappointed.\u201d\n\nNow, she helps others navigate the emotional twists and turns.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never a dull moment,\u201d she said.\n\nForging connections in the unregulated world of sperm donation\n\nAlthough there are no firm numbers, experts say more people than ever are connecting with biological relatives. Over 15 million have signed up for 23andMe and Ancestry.com, the two major at-home genetics testing companies, both of which offer an optional relatives matching tool (the companies do not disclose how many matches have been made).\n\nThe matching tools work by showing customers others who have signed up for the same genetics test whose DNA overlaps with their own, if they have also opted in to the feature. By displaying the percentage of overlap, it indicates how close the relation is. Users can then send messages to their connections through 23andMe or Ancestry.com.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Donor Sibling Registry, the largest matching site for donor-conceived people, more than 16,300 offspring have found half-siblings or donors, with nearly a quarter of those connections being made in just the last three years, says its co-founder and director, Wendy Kramer, whose son, Ryan, is donor-conceived. Kramer and her son co-founded the registry in 2000.\n\nIncreasingly, donors and their offspring are going beyond an initial online connection, according to Rosanna Hertz, a professor of sociology and women\u2019s and gender studies at Wellesley College in Massachusetts who researches contemporary reproduction.\n\n\u201cIn early surveys that I did [in 2009], people would find other donor siblings. They would exchange emails, maybe some photographs, and that would be it. Now more people are choosing to meet offline,\u201d said Hertz, the co-author of a new book, \u201cRandom Families: Genetic Strangers, Sperm Donor Siblings and the Creation of New Kin.\u201d\n\nBut the unregulated landscape of sperm banks has added to the challenges donors and offspring face when they meet. For one thing, with no federal data or tracking, donors have no idea how many offspring they have sired \u2014 and consequently, no idea how many they can expect to hear from.\n\nDespite efforts to increase regulation, sperm banks in America operate with barely any federal scrutiny. Experts say there is no official tally of how many babies have been born as a result of sperm donations in the U.S, nor is there a large effort on the part of banks to obtain such data (most ask sperm recipients to self-report any pregnancies and births, but they do not require it).\n\nAnd while there are recommendations for how many times a single sperm donor\u2019s specimen should be used, there are no laws officially limiting how many babies can be born from one man\u2019s sperm, as there are in the United Kingdom, Norway and Hong Kong, among many other countries.\n\nFor the growing number of donors and their children, figuring out a relationship can be complex, Hertz said.\n\n\"The donors usually play it by what the kids want.\"\n\nSome donors want to get to know their offspring, but have never told their spouses that they used to donate sperm. Other times, a donor gets overly excited and will post pictures of his offspring on Facebook, upsetting the parents who raised the children.\n\nBut generally, donors are respectful, Hertz said, based on her interviews with more than 550 people and surveys of more than 4,000 others.\n\n\u201cThe donors usually play it by what the kids want,\u201d she said.\n\nAn instant bond\n\nThat is the approach that Ellenstein says he has taken with each of his children. Rachel White, 24, was the first to make contact with Ellenstein after she used the scant details that the sperm bank had given her mother to find him on the Internet Movie Database in 2017 and match his birthday and other information.\n\nPeter Ellenstein poses with his biological daughter Rachel White. Dania Maxwell / for NBC News\n\nWhen White, who works in music production, first met Ellenstein, she saw a lot of herself in him \u2014 and the similarities went beyond their looks. Ellenstein bumped into a table as he walked toward her at the Los Angeles cafe where they met \u2014 White, whose mother is dancer, had always wondered where her clumsiness came from.\n\nWhite talks to Ellenstein on the phone daily now, asking for advice on everything from money to car repairs, and catching up on how her half-siblings are doing. She said she sometimes jokingly calls Ellenstein \u201cdad,\u201d but he\u2019s more like an uncle.\n\n\"He almost feels like a strange, older, male extension of myself.\"\n\n\u201cHe almost feels like a strange, older male extension of myself,\u201d she said. \u201cBut obviously we\u2019re not the same person. We are vastly different in many ways, but it feels like a weird limb that I discovered.\u201d\n\nIn a private Facebook group with his offspring, Ellenstein has noticed that his children share his love for board games, podcasts and puns and word play.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been nicknamed all kinds of things by them \u2014 \u2018Papa Jerk\u2019 included,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThey all have a pretty word-oriented and snarky and kind of profane sense of humor. There\u2019s no shortage of swearing.\u201d\n\n\u2018Please be yourself\u2019\n\nMichael Rubino, a Los Angeles artist, donated sperm in the 1990s in the hopes of helping couples struggling with infertility. He has 20 offspring, 18 of whom he has met. A Democrat, atheist and vegetarian, Rubino was initially worried when he first heard from one of his biological children: Nathan Mayes, a Republican, evangelical Christian from Bryant, Arkansas, who enjoys hunting.\n\nMayes, 20, also wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. He does mission work and was worried about Rubino\u2019s lack of belief in God. Nonetheless, he flew to California a couple years ago to meet Rubino, 59, and they bonded over their shared passion for creating art.\n\n\"We are polar opposites, yet we are so much alike.\"\n\nEncouraged, Mayes then invited Rubino to meet the family who raised him. But Mayes was nervous about how Rubino would respond to displays of faith, so he requested beforehand that his family not say grace during the visit, something they normally do at every meal.\n\n\u201cWe were still kind of getting to know each other, and I definitely didn\u2019t want to make him uncomfortable,\u201d Mayes said.\n\nA few days into the visit \u2014 during which Rubino found more common ground with the family than he expected \u2014 the family confessed to Rubino that they usually said grace, but had held off at Mayes\u2019 request.\n\nThat struck Rubino as considerate but unnecessary.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out, I said, \u2018Oh no, you guys. Nathan, please be yourself.\u2019\u201d\n\nMichael Rubino, left, stands beside his biological son Nathan Mayes in front of a mural the two painted together. Despite opposing views on politics and religion, the two have a tight bond. Courtesy of Michael Rubino\n\nSince then, their relationship has strengthened. Like Rubino, Mayes enjoys painting. So when Mayes was scraping together money for a study-abroad program, Rubino invited him to join him on a mural-painting job in California. The two have since worked on two other murals together.\n\n\u201cI was excited and really, really nervous when I did my first painting with him,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cBut he is so easy and comfortable to work with.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship now is like that of \u201cbest friends,\u201d Mayes added. \u201cWe are polar opposites, yet we are so much alike.\u201d\n\nWhen a sperm donor becomes a housemate\n\nJessica Share, whose 13-year-old daughter Alice Mikell is donor-conceived, never expected to meet her child\u2019s sperm donor, never mind date him and move in with him. But that is exactly what happened last year.\n\nUntil she signed Alice up for a 23andMe test, Share, who lived in Oregon and works in marketing, simply knew Alice\u2019s father as Donor No. 2008 at the Fairfax Cryobank. When Aaron Long, 52, popped up as a DNA match in February 2017, Share sent him a message.\n\nLong, a communications specialist for a nonprofit in Seattle, had donated sperm more than two decades earlier to make some money after returning from teaching English overseas. He had already begun hearing from some of his offspring (he has at least 10), and he wrote back a warm introduction about himself to Share, attaching a 13-page biography that he had written and shared with his other biological children.\n\nFor the next five months, Share and Long continued to exchange messages. Then in July 2017, Long invited all of the biological children he had connected with by that point to visit Seattle.\n\nWhen they met in person, Share was struck by how familiar Long already seemed: So many of his mannerisms were similar to their daughter\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had been watching him for over a decade,\u201d said Share, who has another daughter who was also donor-conceived by Long (that daughter lives with Share\u2019s ex-wife and has not met Long). \u201cI had these threads of him. This wasn\u2019t what made the bond, but it certainly made him very familiar to me because he right away looked and acted like people I had known and loved for a decade.\u201d\n\nWeeks after meeting Long, Share, 42, and Alice were having trouble with their landlord in Oregon. A spot opened up in Long\u2019s building, a communal living cooperative, and given how close Long was growing with Share, he suggested they move in for a few months.\n\nIt ended up going well \u2014 so well that Long and Share began dating and now live together, with Alice. In May, another biological daughter of Long\u2019s, who is 21, joined them from Virginia.\n\nAaron Long poses with his mother, center, and three of his biological children, Madalyn Saunders, second from left, Bryce Gallo and Alice Mikell, far right. Alice's mom, Jessica Share, who is also Long's girlfriend, is at left. Courtesy of Aaron Long\n\nFor Share, the new living arrangement is a welcome twist.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Love her or hate her, Nancy Pelosi is a rare legend in her own time \u2014 a figure who is at once historic and still very relevant.\n\nThe highest-ranking woman in the history of American government, Pelosi has twice helped lead her caucus from the minority to the majority and is fairly regarded as the best congressional vote-counter of her generation.\n\nBut now, with the California congresswoman trying to return to the speakership, a small band of her Democratic colleagues would rather relegate her to the past than allow her to lead them again.\n\nThe fight is very real.\n\nIt's a battle consuming House Democrats in the wake of the midterm elections, and it is one that is wrapped up in the ideological, gender, racial and generational politics of a moment in which the party is both optimistic about its resurgence and terrified of the possibility that its gains will be washed away by President Donald Trump and the GOP in two years.\n\nBut it's also increasingly entangled in personal animus \u2014 the disdain that a handful of harsh Pelosi critics have for her and the rising frustration that many rank-and-file Democrats have with them for forcing the party into an ugly debate on the heels of its biggest House victory since the post-Watergate class of 1974.\n\nSome in the party believe that Pelosi, who has demonstrated her ability as both a partisan warrior and backroom deal-maker, is the perfect leader at a precarious time for Democrats.\n\n\"No one has her legislative chops or wealth of experience,\" said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va. \"She knows how to exhort, inspire, cajole, intimidate and persuade. She never lost a vote on the floor as speaker. She worked tirelessly to bring us out of the wilderness. She has earned it.\"\n\nOthers see her potential promotion as a step backward \u2014 a message to the country that Democrats aren't agents of change \u2014 and a surefire attack point against newly elected freshmen in their first re-election bids.\n\n\"Last week, the American people sent a clear message that we need a new approach and new leaders in Congress,\" Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who lost to Pelosi in a minority leader race two years ago, said Wednesday. \"It\u2019s time for us to listen.\"\n\nBetween returning incumbents and incoming freshmen, there are roughly two dozen Democrats who have publicly indicated they will or could vote against Pelosi. For some of the newcomers, distancing themselves from the California Democrat \u2014 who was a staple of Republican campaign ads and talking points across the country \u2014 was a matter of political survival.\n\nThe big question is how many members of the next Congress \u2014 like Ryan \u2014 truly want to stop Pelosi from taking the helm of the House in January and how many simply need to signal to voters back home that they raised an objection to her.\n\nIf politically safe House veterans like Ryan and fellow Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who are among the ringleaders of the anti-Pelosi faction, choose not to back Pelosi on the floor, that puts more pressure on freshmen who just won tough districts to cast potentially perilous votes that help her win.\n\nThat's a strike against the rebel crowd for Democrats who would prefer to see Pelosi win while allowing as many freshmen as possible to not vote for her.\n\nThe coming days will be a test of Pelosi's ability to maneuver through the thicket of Democratic Caucus personalities and House rules, a point of strength for her in the past but a challenge at a time when the eyes of her party, and the nation, will be fixed on what her colleagues decide.\n\nShe and her allies have been ramping up the campaign to secure votes \u2014 several union, interest groups and Democratic Party luminaries put out statements announcing their support for her \u2014 a clear indication that she knows she has to work hard to win.\n\nAt the same time, an emboldened faction of her harshest critics has been promising that it can deliver the votes to deny her the speakership.\n\nRep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, said Wednesday that she's considering a bid against Pelosi \u2014 giving the recalcitrants a potential alternative.\n\n\"When you look at the people who support this party the most, they are women and African Americans and especially African American women,\" Fudge, who is black, told Cleveland.com. \"We keep talking about diversity, but there is nothing diverse about the top of our ticket. We have to not just talk the talk, but walk the walk.\"\n\nAfter meeting with Pelosi Friday, Fudge said that she would make a decision after Thanksgiving and would weigh the \"enormity\" of the job \u2014 the long hours of campaigning and fundraising for the party's candidates \u2014 as part of her calculus.\n\nFor Pelosi, the first step is a vote in the Democratic Caucus, which is scheduled for the week after Thanksgiving. In short, Pelosi will be running to be the party's pick for speaker when the whole House \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 vote on the post in January.\n\nThere's no question that she has the backing of a majority of her caucus. In fact, right now, she has no competition from within the party at all.\n\nDemocratic aides have said it's possible that if she doesn't draw a challenge, they may hold an up or down vote on her in caucus and publicize the vote tallies.\n\n\"Certainly a possibility,\" a Democratic aide who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about internal deliberations told NBC over email. \"Not clear yet.\"\n\nThat way, the \"no\" voters could point to their effort to oppose her. For the same reason, it makes sense that her critics might not actually field a challenger \u2014 because it would give an easy out to those who promised to oppose her without forcing them to vote against her on the floor.\n\nThe second, tougher step is the full House floor vote. To win that, Pelosi needs a majority of the members who vote \u2014 Republicans and Democrats. Typically, that would mean at least 218 of the 435 House members. But, of course, there's a wrinkle: Any members who vote \"present\" are not counted.\n\nIf, for example, there are 232 Democrats and 203 House Republicans \u2014 some races are still being decided \u2014 Pelosi could defeat incoming House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy 204-203 with 28 Democrats voting \"present.\"\n\nBut each vote for another lawmaker \u2014 not her or McCarthy \u2014 would make her path harder. Using the same hypothetical partisan split, it would take just 15 Democratic votes for lawmakers other than Pelosi or McCarthy to prevent her from winning a majority and force a second round of balloting on the floor.\n\nThe House keeps voting until someone wins a majority.\n\nAlready, Pelosi allies have reached out to incoming freshmen who said they wouldn't vote for her to ask that they vote \"present,\" Democratic sources told NBC News.\n\nIf Pelosi is able to navigate the labyrinth, it will be proof that her skills at the inside game aren't just the stuff of legend. If she fails, it will be the first time that a minority leader who sought and won re-election at home failed to win the speakership after leading his or her party to the House majority.\n\nThat's one bit of history Pelosi would like to leave intact."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Saphora Smith, Reuters", "title": "Sweden may become latest country to annul child marriages", "description": "Germany, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands have already tightened child marriage laws, while a U.K. lawmaker has introduced a bill to ban underage unions.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sweden-may-become-latest-country-annul-child-marriages-n935281", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2645626/181114-migrants-child-mc-1108_28d63fbfcd2a412b5a88f25b4928dcef.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T12:27:32Z", "content": "Most European countries still allow marriage under the age of 18 in certain circumstances, such as with parental consent or the approval of a judicial or governmental authority.

A British lawmaker has also introduced a bill to ban unions under the age of 18 in England and Wales.\n\nSwedish lawmakers are due to vote on the proposal on Wednesday.\n\nIn 2016, Sweden's Migration Agency said it had identified 132 cases of children who said they were married on asylum applications, but acknowledged there were probably more. In the same year, more than 1,400 underage foreign children were listed as married in Germany, according to the country\u2019s Central Register of Foreign Nationals.\n\nIn 2017, Germany outlawed all marriages involving anyone under 18. So far this year, the official number of married underage foreigners has dropped to under 300, but women\u2019s rights organization Terre Des Femmes said the real number was likely much higher.\n\n\"We fear that many girls now coming to Germany lie about their age or claim they are not married in order not to have their marriage declared invalid,\" said Monika Michell, an expert in honor-based violence for Terre Des Femmes in Germany.\n\nWhile it has recently gained currency because of the refugee crisis, the issue of child marriage among migrants is not new.\n\nSara Mohammad has spoken of how her brother once held a Kalashnikov to her head. She was 17 and he was trying to force her to marry a man she had never met.\n\nOn the day before her wedding Mohammad fled Iraq. She would eventually claim asylum in Sweden, where she now runs a nonprofit association, GAPF, which campaigns against honor-related violence.\n\nMore than 30 years later, she is hopeful her adoptive country will extend its ban on child marriage.\n\nSara Mohammad fled her own child marriage and founded a charity. Anders Henrikson\n\n\u201cIt would be a great thing for the Swedish government to show the world that we protect children from child marriage,\u201d she said.\n\nSo Sweden\u2019s legislation could not come soon enough for Mohammad. She said she believed guilt felt by many in former colonizing countries and a fear of being accused of racism or Islamophobia has stopped European Union governments from legislating against child marriage for foreigners.\n\nCultural relativism \u2014 the idea that morality is not absolute but exists in relation to one\u2019s culture or religion \u2014 also played a role, she said. \"We see them as victims,\" Mohammad added.\n\nBut others argue that religion, culture and circumstance should be taken into account when considering invalidating child marriages of foreigners and especially asylum-seekers.\n\n\u201cIf the child concerned is happy and it was a consensual relationship, why would I break them up? Why would I want to annul that?\u201d asked Ajmal Masroor, a British imam. \u201cThe revised law is going to target them disproportionately, marginalizing them even further, criminalize them for nothing and may push them into a more vulnerable position than they already are.\"\n\nMasroor criticized the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of European countries\u2019 tendency to consider a young person adult enough to choose to have sex but not to decide to marry.\n\nPracticing Muslims cannot have sex or start a family before they are married, and therefore any legislation that raises the age of marital consent above the age of sexual consent discriminates against them, he said.\n\nHeather Barr, a senior researcher at the Women\u2019s Rights Division of Human Rights Watch, said while she supported outlawing child marriage, a blanket decision to invalidate all underage unions of refugees and asylum-seekers was not the answer.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody arrives and they\u2019re already married, the situation is more complicated and that\u2019s why nothing short of an individual assessment is going to do the trick,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said social workers would have to assess the best interests of the child considering that she is already married. This, Barr said, included asking how the girl may be perceived by her community if she is no longer married and whether it might expose her to a higher risk of violence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it makes you an apologist for child marriage in any way to say that these situations are complicated,\u201d she said.\n\nDecisions by countries such as Germany, Norway or Denmark to raise the age of marital consent in the wake of the refugee crisis struck her as \u201cugly,\u201d and she suggested that it was most likely fueled by stereotypes and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cLots of European countries that didn\u2019t see any problem with the laws that they have on the books that permitted child marriage have suddenly become concerned that those laws are a problem,\u201d she said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "Argentine Navy submarine found a year after disappearing with 44 aboard", "description": "The Argentine Navy said on Saturday a private company hired by the government has located the submarine ARA San Juan some 2625 feet below the ocean's surface a year after it went missing with 44 crew members aboard.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/argentine-navy-submarine-found-year-after-disappearing-44-aboard-n937536", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_48/2244851/171130-ara-san-juan-memorial-ew-538p_b320cce2d68d2fd715d476717aad0be3.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T11:39:17Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It was found some 2,625 feet below the ocean's surface by a marine tracking contractor Ocean Infinity.\n\nThe disappearance gripped the nation's attention as the government struggled to provide information about the tragedy.\n\nAt the time of the disappearance, the Navy said water that had entered the submarine's snorkel caused its battery to short-circuit.

Nashua Police Department\n\nBy then, Hastbacka was confident that he had enough to charge her for using someone else\u2019s social security number.\n\nHastbacka took Lawrence into the backseat of his FBI vehicle to transfer her into federal custody.\n\n\u201cShe challenged me that I only knew 20 percent of what she's done over the years, and I would never be able to figure it out,\u201d Hastbacka said. \u201cSo, challenge accepted.\u201d\n\nEvading law enforcement by using aliases\n\nThat taunting challenge from Lawrence resulted in Hastbacka learning that she wasn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill con artist.\n\nOver the next several weeks, the scope of Lawrence\u2019s decades-long, cross-country crime spree would come into focus.\n\nThe FBI found evidence that she had built a life of lies in order to swindle at least seven unsuspecting victims \u2014 including a pilot, rabbi and a boyfriend\u2019s mother \u2014 out of hundreds of thousands of dollars, authorities say.\n\nLawrence had evaded law enforcement for more than 20 years by using 19 different aliases across 16 states, the FBI says. All the while, the FBI says, she was carrying out schemes that ranged from her pretending she was pregnant to posing as an Ivy League-educated attorney.\n\nAt times, Lawrence even used her young daughter as her prop, the FBI says. These frauds included telling victims she needed money because her \u201cniece\u2019s\u201d parents had died in a car crash.\n\nHastbacka and the other investigators also learned that Lawrence had a total of six children with six different men, leaving a dozen damaged lives in her wake, not including all of her other victims.\n\nThe crumbling of a house of cards\n\nNBC News made multiple attempts to contact Lawrence through her website, social media accounts and associates. She never returned the requests for comment.\n\nThe crumbling of Lawrence\u2019s house of cards was set in motion after she offered her services as a grant writer for the Nashua mayor\u2019s office in the fall of 2016.\n\nKim Kleiner, the mayor\u2019s chief of staff, was happy to have the help. Nashua was in need of a new soccer field and a playground for the local elementary school.\n\nFBI Agent Mark Hastbacka Today\n\n\u201cShe seemed excited and she seemed capable. She\u2019s very smart,\u201d Kleiner recalled.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t take long before Kleiner and her colleagues noticed something was off with the office\u2019s newest volunteer.\n\nFirst Lawrence pushed back when told she had to run potential grant applications by her superiors. Then she was found to have tried to get access to the city\u2019s bank account numbers in what she described as part of an effort to solicit grant money, Kleiner said.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to know what account that money had to go into, how it worked, who accepted it. Information that I was like, \u2018You don\u2019t really need to know that. You just have to have them contact us.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShe just lost it,\u201d Kleiner explained, \u201cAt one point she broke down in tears and claimed we weren\u2019t being thankful. It was emotional and it was just, odd.\u201d\n\nThe most troubling episode came after Kleiner told Lawrence her role with the mayor\u2019s office wasn\u2019t working out.\n\nThe next day, \u201cShe called my cell and basically threatened me,\u201d Kleiner said. \u201cThat she knew things about me, and my husband, and my daughter, and the mayor that she was going to take public. I said, \u2018Fine, whatever it is that you think you know, go for it. This is over.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor Kleiner, the threats to her family were a tipping point.\n\nA profile on a scam-spotting website\n\nHastbacka received a call from Kleiner, who was an acquaintance, on May 7, 2017. Kleiner \u201cgave me her name, her cell phone number, and the address,\u201d Hastbacka recalled of the phone call. \u201cThat's all she knew about her.\u201d\n\nHastbacka accompanied a local police officer to Lawrence\u2019s home where her boyfriend told them she had left for New York. The boyfriend, Nick Panteleakis, had told the same story when the local officer showed up without Hastbacka days earlier, Hastbacka said.\n\nFifteen minutes after Hastbacka and the detective left the apartment, Panteleakis called Hastbacka\u2019s cell phone with a different story. \u201cShe'd been hiding in the basement the whole time,\u201d Hastbacka recalled. Lawrence agreed to go to the police station for an interview in part, Hasbacka believes, because before he and the detective left her apartment, they\u2019d taken paperwork, a number of cell phones, a laptop and various IDs in different names.\n\nLawrence initially insisted that she was indeed Genna Kaplan. When Hastbacka told her he knew that she provided someone else\u2019s Social Security number on her apartment rental application, she said she did so because she was running from an abusive ex, according to Hastbacka.\n\nLawrence finally gave up her name, but her penchant for avoiding bank accounts and credit cards complicated the effort to fill in who she was, the FBI said.\n\nWithout much of a paper trail to follow, Hastbacka started Googling the names he had found in the paperwork from her apartment.\n\nThe online searches turned up a profile on Ripoff Report, the scam-spotting website. \u201cNothing had been updated in that site for probably five years,\u201d Hastbacka recalled, \u201cAnd these victims, over the years, had shared common experiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis woman is crazy! If you knew her in the past I would suggest that you stay the hell away from her,\u201d one post reads.\n\n\u201cWish I had some pics to post, but she always made sure to stay away from the camera,\u201d reads another. \u201cLike many of you I too have had the misfortune of meeting this sick individual. Thankfully I was able to get out before it was too late.\u201d\n\nAs he dug further into Lawrence\u2019s past, Hastbacka noticed a pattern. She would go on dating websites or visit hotel bars looking for men, and then tell the men she was pregnant with their child, sometimes after just one date, according to Hastbacka.\n\n\u201cShe would tell them that she was an Ivy League-educated attorney, that she came from incredible wealth, that her father was deceased, her mother was a doctor with Doctors Without Borders, working in Africa. She said that her family had connections to the royal family. And somehow, you know, she would doctor up photographs to show that.\u201d\n\nHastbacka said she seemed to target a particular type of man in her schemes, which often involved setting up credit cards in their names.\n\n\u201cThey all seemed to be well-to-do professionals \u2014 attorneys, pilots, business owners. None of them have ever been married before. None of them had any children from any previous relationship. So most every one of them was looking for that in their life,\u201d he said.\n\nMen weren\u2019t her only victims. In one case, she conned a family out of $10,000 by promising that they could adopt twins from her, only to tell them later that the non-existent children died in a car accident, according to the FBI.\n\nHastbacka\u2019s digging led him to Kevin Little.\n\nWhen Little met Lawrence in 2001, he was bartending in Orlando. Lawrence left a $200 tip on a $70 tab. The next night, Little said she came back with a corporate card from Lucasfilm claiming she worked for George Lucas, the Star Wars filmmaker, in New York City.\n\nLawrence said she was in town to take care of her sick mother, and over the next few days, she continued visiting the bar, ultimately leaving more than $2,200 in tips, Little recalled.\n\nLittle and Lawrence ultimately had a one night stand, and not long afterward, she told him she was pregnant with his child. After their daughter Avery was born, Lawrence took Avery and skipped town.\n\nLittle eventually won custody of Avery after Lawrence was arrested in New York City in 2005 on fraud charges. He said Avery hasn\u2019t seen her mother since.\n\nHastbacka said there were some stories that he couldn\u2019t ever forget. \u201cShe told one gentleman up in Canada, who's an aspiring actor who she went and stayed with for a few months while she was on the run, that the family had close ties to the actor Jack Nicholson, and that they could arrange for him to get into some of Jack Nicholson's movies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking to talk to him because he really believed it,\u201d Hastbacka said.\n\nAs he pieced together Lawrence\u2019s past, Hastbacka learned that Lawrence had at least six children, each by different fathers.\n\nBut one child\u2019s name came up more than the rest.\n\nShe used her daughter as a \"prop\"\n\nKennedy was Lawrence\u2019s second child. She became a key part of several of Lawrence\u2019s schemes, according to the FBI.\n\n\u201cKennedy was the one child that she tried her best to keep with her while she was on the run,\u201d Hastbacka said.\n\nLawrence often portrayed Kennedy as a niece whose parents died from cancer or in a car accident, the FBI said. \u201cWhatever story was most sympathetic at the time,\u201d Hastbacka said.\n\nHastbacka said Lawrence treated Kennedy not as a daughter but as a \u201cprop.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Nicole Spector", "title": "How to get the most out of Black Friday without overspending", "description": "Want to score the best deals on Black Friday?

In the mid-60\u2019s, the day after Thanksgiving was given its famous name by the Philadelphia Police Department to describe the chaos of shoppers creating traffic jams around stores downtown.\n\nSurely, a lot has changed since then, and with the boom of ecommerce and the influx of other mega shopping holidays, Black Friday as a one-day brick-and-mortar extravaganza has lost some steam. Now, Black Friday exists both online and offline, and heralds the official beginning of the holiday shopping season (if you didn\u2019t already stock up on Amazon Prime Day, that is). Cyber Monday happens just a few days later, and last year out-performed Black Friday, bringing in nearly $6.6 billion compared to Black Friday\u2019s $5 billion (a number that also considers buys made on Thanksgiving Day itself).\n\nBlack Friday may not be the be-all and end-all blowout it once was, but it\u2019s still a significant time for savings \u2014 and with that, spending.\n\n\u201cShoppers plan to spend $803, which is $60 more than last year,\u201d Sara Skirboll, resident shopping and trends expert at RetailMeNot tells NBC News BETTER. \u201cAs Black Friday is transforming from a singular shopping day to more of a weekend shopping event, [our] data shows that 78 percent shopping throughout the weekend, and 33 percent of those shoppers will be getting a head start by shopping the night of Thanksgiving, spending an average of $191.\u201d\n\nWhat awesome sales can we expect on Black Friday and which are the dud deals we may want to avoid? Try these tips to navigate the holiday weekend without getting overwhelmed.\n\nMake a list into two sections: \u2018For me\u2019 and \u2018For others\u2019\n\n\u201cHoliday shopping can be stressful and expensive if you don\u2019t have a strategy in place,\u201d notes Chelsea Hudson, consumer shopping expert at TopCashback.com. \u201cAccording to a recent survey by TopCashback.com, 60 percent of Americans report holiday shopping is stressful and overwhelming. To ensure you have a smooth shopping experience: create and calculate a budget and then split purchases into two categories: presents [for others] and household purchases such as entertaining costs. The more prepared you are for Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, the better.\u201d\n\nBy breaking the list into two sections, you can more aptly stay on budget, and also narrow down specifics to meet all your holiday shopping goals. Additionally, making a list helps you dodge impulse buys, which can cost Americans over $5,000 a year.\n\nAct early (even before Black Friday) on trendy toys\n\nThough big box retailers started pushing out holiday deals earlier this month, generally you want to wait until Black Friday to maximize savings \u2014 unless you\u2019re shopping for something hotly in demand, like certain toys.\n\n\u201cBased on shopping and purchasing habits over the past several years, you\u2019ll want to snag top toys by Black Friday, thanks to supply and demand,\u201d says Hudson.\n\nFor a look at what some of the most wanted toys are this holiday season, check out Amazon\u2019s Top 100 Toys list. You can see which items are featuring discounts, and search according to which sport the strongest savings.\n\nWhen searching online, remember to use a browser extension for cashback or automatic application of coupon codes. I recommend EBates, Honey, Wikibuy, TopCashback and RetailMeNotGenie.\n\nTake advantage of deals on electronics, travel, winter apparel and kitchen goods\n\nPer Black Friday tradition, retailers will be delivering doorbuster deals. Typically rolled out on Black Friday morning (though we also see them slide in on Thanksgiving Day), these can be the trickiest sales to navigate because they all seem so worthy, but undoubtedly there will be some mediocre offerings.\n\nThe key is to know what to look for.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely some categories that will be more discounted than others,\u201d says Skirboll. \u201cThe best things to buy on Black Friday include electronics, appliances, winter wear and time-specific travel.\u201d\n\nRetailers are still keeping details of doorbuster deals top secret, but if history is any indicator, we can expect the following type of sales, according to Skirboll:\n\nBest Buy: Up to 75 percent off Black Friday Doorbusters\n\nWalmart: up to 70 percent off Black Friday deals on electronics, toys, home and more\n\nTarget: 20 percent off coupon with $50 purchase (on Black Friday)\n\nMacy\u2019s: 20 percent off select items + free shipping on $49 purchase\n\nHudson adds that we can also expect to see appetizing deals on kitchen appliances.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re looking to upgrade your kitchen or simply need a new blender, Black Friday is the time to shop all kitchen appliances,\u201d says Hudson, adding that big-ticket items won\u2019t be the only steals to jump on.\n\n\u201cRetailers such as Kohl\u2019s, Macy\u2019s and JCPenney, for example, will feature kitchen appliances like slow cookers, mixers and coffee makers for $10 or less.\u201d\n\nBeware of lackluster tech products on sale\n\nRetailers will likely be pushing savings on tech, but be cautious and read up before making a (discounted) splurge here.\n\n\u201cI'm always wary of tech deals, specifically laptops, tablets and TVs,\u201d says Krista Fabregas, retail/ecommerce analyst at Fit Small Business. \u201cStores will promote loss-leader savings [in this category]. Consumers need to look at and compare the specs of discounted goods to others on sale, and even those at regular price. This will help ensure they're good values \u2014 not lower-end models that look like a great deal, but really aren't.\u201d\n\nMost likely, you\u2019ll find tech that is strong in some areas and weak in others, so just read up on the item before buying it. It may be just what you\u2019re looking for.\n\n\u201cAn older model on deep discount, say, with a slightly slower processor (or lower resolution) but higher memory and storage, can be the better deal than a new release,\u201d says Fabregas.\n\nPass on phones\n\n\u201cCell phones are typically a false economy,\u201d says Hudson. \u201cMost of the time, you won\u2019t receive a discounted phone, but you may receive a bonus on incentive such as a gift card to entice users to upgrade to a newer phone. The deepest discounts on phones are found when the latest generation retires and a new one is ready for pre-order.\u201d\n\nAmazon will slash prices on its own brands\n\nAmazon holds its own Black Friday-like event with Prime Day in July, but the mammoth company is not about to miss out on another goldmine. Consumers can expect an ongoing festival of Amazon sales around Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\n\n\u201cPrime Day is usually a pretty good indicator of what to expect from Amazon during the holiday season,\u201d notes Cooper Smith, director, Amazon IQ research at Gartner L2. \u201cThis year we saw discounts span a wider range of categories with the most deals occurring in Home, Electronics and Sports & Outdoors. We also expect deep discounts in the Toys category as Amazon looks to fill the void left by Toys 'R Us.\u201d\n\nSmith adds that Amazon's exclusive offerings will be featured prominently across the site in an effort to raise awareness for its more than 130 private label brands \u2014 \u201cwhich sell everything from mattresses to activewear\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe'll see a range of discounts across Amazon's portfolio of internet-connected Alexa devices, with the newest models such as the Echo Look being discounted the most at up to 50 percent off,\u201d said Smith.\n\nPro-tips for staying sane and saving dough\n\nTo bring more structure (and sanity) to the Black Friday shopping mayhem, Fabregas offers the following pro-tips for consumers:\n\nSet your budget as early as possible (like, now).\n\nas early as possible (like, now).

Honea said. All were found inside structures.\n\nHonea cautioned that the number of unaccounted for \u2014 1,011 as of Friday night \u2014 could include names that are duplicates or have different spelling variations, and that investigators were working to verify them.\n\n\"I can't let perfection get in the way of progress,\" Honea said. \"It's important for us to get the information out so that we can get started on identifying these unaccounted individuals.\"\n\nThe increasing death toll in the Camp Fire in Butte County, north of Sacramento, brought the total number of deaths in two wildfires in the state to at least 74. Three deaths have been reported in the Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles.\n\nThe Camp Fire has displaced thousands of people and led to the evacuation of some 52,000 at the fire's peak. About 47,200 remained evacuated Friday, officials said. The fire has burned 148,000 acres and was 55 percent contained Friday.\n\nThe Camp Fire is considered the most destructive wildfire in recorded state history, eclipsing the 2017 Tubbs Fire, which destroyed 5,636 structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire.\n\nIt is also the deadliest. The 1933 Griffith Park Fire killed 29 people.\n\nThe Camp Fire was one of two major wildfires burning at opposite ends of the state. The Woolsey Fire, which also broke out the same day, has burned more than 98,300 acres and destroyed at least 713 homes and other structures, officials said. It was 78 percent contained Friday.

Friedman granted John Hinckley Jr. the largest measure of freedom he\u2019s had since shooting and wounding Reagan and three others outside a Washington hotel in 1981.\n\nHinckley was confined for decades to St. Elizabeths Hospital in the nation\u2019s capital. Starting in 2006, he began to make trips to visit his mother, who is now in her 90s and lives in a gated community in Williamsburg. He moved in with her in 2016.\n\nThe judge wrote Friday that the 63-year-old Hinckley can now live within 75 miles of that city as long as Hinckley\u2019s doctors give their approval on the location.\n\nHinckley still must live under a long list of conditions. They include meeting at least twice a month with a social worker, a psychiatrist and a therapist. He can\u2019t own a gun or consume alcohol or drugs.\n\nJohn Hinckley Jr. (L) escorted by police in Washington following his arrest after shooting and seriously wounding then US president Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981. - / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nHe\u2019s also barred from contacting his victims\u2019 families or traveling anywhere where there are former or current U.S. presidents, vice presidents and members of Congress. He must carry a GPS-enabled cellphone when he\u2019s away from home.\n\nFriedman, who is a judge in the District of Columbia, wrote that a forensic psychologist and a forensic psychiatrist supported the changes to the conditions of Hinckley\u2019s release.\n\nFriedman also wrote that \u201cthis court finds that Mr. Hinckley will not pose a danger to himself or others if he is permitted to continue residing full-time in Williamsburg, Virginia, on convalescent leave under the proposed conditions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Hinckley could be granted even more independence in the future. His attorney, Barry Levine, said he\u2019ll request unconditional release for Hinckley. The next court date is scheduled for June.\n\n\u201cIt would be the complete restoration to life as you and I know it,\u201d Levine said during an interview on Friday.\n\n\u201cWould he continue to see mental health professionals? Of course. He doesn\u2019t mind that. Those people have been wonderful to him,\u201d Levine added.\n\n\u201cIf we wanted to go Paris, he could do it. He could do whatever you could do,\u201d Levine added. \u201cHis compliance with the court over the many years has been unfailingly flawless. And if people knew him, they would like him.\u201d\n\nHinckley was 25 when he shot Reagan in March 1981. The shooting also paralyzed press secretary James Brady and injured two others. Hinckley was suffering from acute psychosis and major depression and had become obsessed with the actress Jodie Foster.\n\nWhen jurors found him not guilty by reason of insanity, they said he needed treatment, not a lifetime in confinement.\n\nAt court hearings in recent years, doctors have testified that Hinckley\u2019s psychosis and major depression have been in remission for decades and that, while he still has a narcissistic personality disorder, its effects have diminished.\n\nA handout photograph made available by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shows John Warnock Hinckley Jr on March 30, 1981 FBI via EPA file\n\nThe home of Hinckley\u2019s mother is on the 13th hole of a golf course.

He also interacts with people in the area, visiting record stores and taking guitar lessons.\n\nIn 2015, Cabot Wade, a musician who gave Hinckley guitar lessons, said he never felt Hinckley was violent or dangerous.\n\nNevertheless, he said then that \u201cnobody will touch him with a 10-foot pole.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Josh Lederman", "title": "CIA concludes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered killing of Khashoggi", "description": "The CIA has concluded Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, NBC News has confirmed.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-ordered-killing-n937476", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_12/2363401/180315-bin-salman-mc-1006_98f2079a72ad23f7e26314ac2bc8b898.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T01:16:21Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.
