The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Rehema Ellis and Janelle Richards\n\nThe upcoming movie, \"Green Book,\" tells the tale of two men who are forced to become friends during their journey on a concert tour in the racist, Jim Crow-era South.\n\nBased on a true story, in the 1960s, musician Don Shirley and tough guy/chauffeur Tony Lip are complete opposites. Shirley is a highly-educated African-American who lives above Carnegie Hall playing classical music for audiences. Lip, is an Italian-American from the Bronx who works in security but agrees to be Shirley's driver through the south.\n\nThe release of the film comes a year after a deadly white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville, Va., and amid a three-year surge in hate crime. Americans also continue to protest over gun control, police brutality, politics and immigration.\n\nViggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in \"Green Book.\" Universal Studios\n\nAcademy Award nominee Viggo Mortensen plays Tony Lip in the film and said the message of the film will resonate with many.\n\n\"One thing I felt was really valuable, in the script, was that it didn't tell you what to think,\" Mortensen said. \"It didn't tell you what to feel. Yes, there's a history lesson. There's a civics lesson there. You could even say that there's a cautionary tale that can be applied to our time, or any time really, in terms of discrimination, racism, ignorance.\"\n\nFor Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali, who plays Don Shirley, the story's message is as relevant now as it was decades ago.\n\n\"I will say if it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago it would be a movie for our time,\" said Ali. \"I think the difference is, a heightened awareness about the division in our country, in the last couple of years. I think there's more eyes on the problems, and the things that need to be bridged between communities. And I do feel that this film fits perfectly in the culture right now, as far as something that can serve as an example of what is possible.\"\n\nThe storyline, Ali said, is simple: Two very different guys who grow to respect and admire one another.\n\nNick Vallelonga, the real Tony Lip's son, co-wrote the film. He got Shirley's permission to tell their story but agreed to do so only after Shirley had died.\n\nViggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in \"Green Book.\" Universal Studios\n\n\"I felt whenever I told it, it would resonate and ring true,\" said Vallelonga. \"I think, it's a bit of a metaphor, not to get clich\u00e9, it's about, the country, what's going on, and these two opposites coming together. And it just shows communication, love and shared experience \u2014 it sounds too simple, but everybody's the same. Same human emotions, loves, wants, needs and they came together that way.\"\n\nAli said he was drawn to the film because he had not seen a character like Shirley's on-screen before. Knowing it's always a greater challenge to portray a real-life character, Ali said he spent time watching documentaries about Shirley so could accurately reflect his style. Ali even immersed himself in intense piano lessons to learn how that would affect his posture and his awareness to embody Shirley\u2019s style. Along the way, Ali realized that Shirley's performances in the South were his way of taking a non-violent stance against discrimination.\n\n\"Black people have always had to sort of equip themselves in combating racism and discrimination [with] dignity and intelligence,\" said Ali. \"I believe Doctor Shirley was are of this in a really heightened way. And so, therefore every exchange that he would have, every plantation mansion he would play at, he was aware that these people thought of him, thought of his people, thought of his tribe in a certain light.\"\n\nBut while he was welcomed to perform for white audiences, Shirley was never accepted as an equal. In the movie he\u2019s not allowed to eat in restaurants with white people. Even the restrooms were segregated. Scenes in the movie show him turned away from eating at bars and using the restroom inside one venue where he was scheduled to perform.\n\nWhile Shirley and Lip traveled, they had to rely on the Green Book, which listed hotels, restaurants and even gas stations that were safe for black people.\n\nCreated by Victor H. Green in Harlem, for 30 years, travelers from across the country depended on \u201cThe Negro Motorist Green Book,\" to evade what could be dangerous and demeaning situations.\n\n\"[Creating the book], wasn't done as a business venture,\" said Maira Liriano, associate chief librarian at The Schomburg Center's Research division. \"They didn't do this to make money. This was a service to the community, the African-American community. Victor and Alma and the other people involved in creating this were very much products of their time. And, they knew that to be African-American in this country you had to depend on each other to get through, to get through life.\"\n\nMany black families at the time avoided visiting the South because of the life threatening situations they could face. Gloria Gardner's parents migrated north, but they still had family in the south. So, with the help of their Green Book they would venture South for visits. The book helped Gardner's family safely navigate their road trip from Michigan to Louisiana.\n\n\"The green book was our survivor guide,\" Gardner explains. \"It was like the Bible for travel it meant the difference between life and death.\"\n\nWhile the book was critical for their survival, she said her mother would have made them travel without it, if needed.\n\n\"She would insist on it,\" Gardner said. \"We just would've gone on a wing and prayer. You always hope that everything's going to work out okay. That you'll be safe. But the guide really helped because you knew where to stop. You knew where to go to get something to eat. You knew where to get gas.\"\n\nIn cities across the country, black people could be turned away for entering the wrong establishment or even risk the possibility of being lynched.\n\nVallelonga hopes the movie will inspire audiences to learn more about this book, a once vital guide for black travelers.\n\n\"Even if we just did that, we did a little spark to get people to go, 'I need to learn about this,' and teach people, wow, this was going on \u2014 not 200 years ago, within our lifetimes. So this is an entertaining movie that hits social causes, and I think we handled it just right,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "CDC yet to find source of romaine contamination", "description": "With at least 32 people sick in 11 states, the CDC is suggesting consumers nationwide clean out their fridge or any surface romaine lettuce has touched.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/cdc-yet-to-find-source-of-romaine-contamination-1377386051946", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/nn_mal_romaine_lettuce_outbreak_181121_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T23:51:07Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "CDC yet to find source of romaine contamination copied!\n\nWith at least 32 people sick in 11 states, the CDC is suggesting consumers nationwide clean out their fridge or any surface romaine lettuce has touched.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Family found dead at burning New Jersey mansion were killed prior to fire, investigators say", "description": "Father Keith Caniero was found dead -- having been shot twice -- outside the million dollar mansion, while wife Jennifer and their young children were also found dead, inside the home.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/family-found-dead-at-burning-new-jersey-mansion-were-killed-prior-to-fire-investigators-say-1377388099747", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/nn_ral_nj_mansion_murder_181121_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T23:50:14Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Family found dead at burning New Jersey mansion were killed prior to fire, investigators say copied!\n\nFather Keith Caniero was found dead -- having been shot twice -- outside the million dollar mansion, while wife Jennifer and their young children were also found dead, inside the home.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Dozens of families homeless after fire rips through Dallas apartment complex", "description": "The fire destroyed 18 occupied apartments, and injured three people -- though everyone survived.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/dozens-of-families-homeless-after-fire-rips-through-dallas-apartment-complex-1377388099593", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/nn_ath_dallas_apartment_fire_181121_1542845711129.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T23:48:58Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Why Fort Worth, Texas could be an example for cities trying to get healthy 02:24"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Trump ramps up support for Saudi Arabia after breaking with CIA assessment on Khashoggi murder", "description": "\u201cOil prices getting lower.

The Obama-era initiative has allowed 700,000 young people, known as \"Dreamers,\" to avoid deportation.\n\nThe Trump administration moved to end the DACA program a year ago, but federal courts have blocked that attempt. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court blocked President Donald Trump from ending the program, temporarily keeping DACA in place. Trump has urged the Supreme Court to take up the issue.\n\nPark said he was hoping to start a conversation and was \"shocked\" the eligibility change happened so quickly.\n\n\"It came out of nowhere. I didn't expect any of that to happen,\" he said.\n\nGerson said the Rhodes Trust was grateful to Harvard for endorsing Park last year despite his technical ineligibility.\n\n\u201cI think Jin is a wonderful example to others and he continues to show great courage under existing law,\u201d he said.\n\nPark said he hoped his achievement would highlight the stories of other undocumented immigrants and what they had to offer the country.\n\n\"I'm thankful and I think it's a testament to if you give immigrants in America an opportunity, if you allow us to live fully in our truth and see us totally in our personhood, this is the kind of thing that can happen,\" he said.\n\nPark is currently completing his bachelor of arts at Harvard in molecular and cellular biology, according to a biography provided by the Rhodes Trust. Park plans on pursuing master\u2019s degrees in migration studies and global health science and epidemiology at Oxford, according to the biography.\n\nPark is also the founder of HigherDreams, Inc., a nonprofit aimed at developing resources for undocumented students seeking higher education, and serves as a chapter program leader for Define American, a nonprofit media and cultural organization working to change conversations about immigrants.\n\nThe Rev. Ryan Eller, the executive director of Define American, celebrated Park\u2019s achievement.\n\n\"As a longtime leader in our Chapters Program, Jin is a shining example of how we can work together to get even the oldest and most celebrated international fellowship awards in the world to change their rules and become more equitable,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe latest U.S. Rhodes Scholar class also of 32 also includes 21 women, the most ever in a single class, and nearly half of the group are first-generation Americans and immigrants.\n\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Courtney Kube", "title": "Mattis can now order lethal force at border, MPs training with riot gear", "description": "Two U.S. officials said military police at the border are already training with riot gear and there are plans to send more MPs to the border in California.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/mattis-can-order-lethal-force-border-mps-training-riot-gear-n938981", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2655086/181121-military-border-caravan-ew-542p_2b534cba700839c78709babea2fd41ab.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T22:58:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Asked whether troops could still be serving there on Christmas, Mattis said, \"Some of those troops certainly will be home. I would anticipate they would be.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Reuters\n\nNEW YORK - A U.S. government agency said on Wednesday that abortion rates among American women of all ages fell to a decade low in 2015, which both opponents and supporters of abortion rights attributed in part to individual states' efforts to restrict women's access to the procedure.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that statistics for 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, show the abortion rate was 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. That is down 26 percent from 2006, when the study began and the rate was 15.9 abortions per 1,000 women.\n\nTeens aged 15 to 19 experienced a greater decrease than older women, with the rate falling 54 percent from 2006 to 2015, the CDC said.\n\n\"This decrease in abortion rate was greater than the decreases for women in any older age group,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\nThe CDC did not provide any reason for the decline, but abortion rights advocates attributed it to increased use of contraceptives as well as decreased access to abortion services in some states.\n\n\"Affordable access to the full range of contraception and family planning options is critical for people deciding if and when they'd like to become parents, develop their careers, plan for their futures and manage their health,\" said Rachel Jones, research scientist at Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank that supports abortion rights.\n\nOpponents of abortion rights said the decrease was primarily the result of many states' efforts to restrict women's access to the procedure.\n\n\"That is due, in a significant way, to pro-life legislation that seeks to provide life-affirming solutions to abortion, combined with pro-life efforts that educate Americans about the effects of abortion and the humanity of the unborn child,\" Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said in an email.\n\nThe total number of reported abortions fell to 638,169 in 2015, from 842,855 in 2006, a 24 percent decrease. In 2015, there were 188 abortions per 1,000 live births, compared with 233 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2006, a drop of 19 percent.\n\nIn 2015, all measures reached their lowest level for the entire period of analysis from 2006 to 2015, the CDC said of the annual study, \"Abortion Surveillance - United States 2015.\"\n\nConservative state lawmakers are passing increasingly restrictive abortion laws in a challenge to Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 landmark decision that established that women have a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Ohio House of Representatives last week approved a measure that would ban abortions at six weeks, while an Iowa law banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected is tied up in a court battle.\n\nSuch laws are designed to end up before the Supreme Court, which has become more conservative following President Donald Trump's appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe CDC study also showed 91.1 percent of abortions performed in 2015 were in a woman's first 13 weeks of pregnancy. There was also a shift toward earlier abortions, with the number performed at six weeks or less increasing 11 percent."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "James Billington, who put Library of Congress online, dies at 89", "description": "Billington doubled the library's traditional analog collections and was credited with creating a massive new Library of Congress online.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/james-billington-who-put-library-congress-online-dies-89-n939136", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2655021/181121-james-billington-ew-435p_28567d62a058139fb1ea2c804dce38cd.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:48:46Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

But really, we treat resolution season as an excuse to overdo it the month before. Oh, it\u2019s okay, because I\u2019ll just burn it off at the gym, anyone?\n\nInstead of employing reasonable boundaries around our consumption and indulgences, we try to explain them away as deliberate decisions made more reasonable by any even mediocre attempt to burn away the calories with lots of aggressive exercise \u2014 exercise that most Americans aren\u2019t doing and, even though resolution season might be a motivating force, wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up if they tried.\n\nWe are not doing either our indulgence or our \"penance\" correctly. We make excuses for enjoying ourselves with friends and family, and more excuses for enjoying the food laid out for our nourishment and happiness, regardless of its nutritional \"quality.\" People are bringing all kinds of guilt and anxiety to their holiday tables and, instead of enjoying the company of their families and reasonable accommodations for traditions, freaking out about the \"aftermath\" and how to earn their excesses retroactively.\n\nIs it a concern that so many of our communal gatherings revolve around food? Sure. We are a country that has yet to get a grip on what is contributing to our rising rates of chronic disease, and health care isn\u2019t guaranteed to be accessible or affordable.\n\nThe nationwide rate of diabetes has risen in the United States, according to Gallup data published last week. The rates for heart disease and heart-related deaths have begun a slow tick upward in some populations. And when it comes to obesity, rates are consistently increasing, especially for children.\n\nBut the holiday season is a time on which we come together with friends and family, loved ones, co-workers and other people whose presence likely may \"require\" alcohol to be considered enjoyable. The freaking-out and excuse-making doesn\u2019t do anything but feed our own anxieties about our health, making them worse. We believe we need to police our own behavior at all times, and punish ourselves when we transgress, and that this is what will make or keep us healthy.\n\nThe policing won\u2019t help, but I have a few ideas about what might.\n\nWe need to encourage each other to engage with food not from a place of anxiety about health and diet, but from a place of community and pleasure. There is more to food than whether or not it will spend \u201ca minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.\u201d Food is how people who love us ensure that we are well fed\u2014it\u2019s a way to contribute to our literal well being. It\u2019s okay if we enjoy that, express gratitude and indulge, especially if the holidays are the one time of year you see them.\n\nWe also need to think about ways to get together without it having to revolve around food \u2014 and often bad food, at that. Let\u2019s be honest: Your aunt\u2019s mashed potatoes that she swears are made from scratch (never mind the empty box-mix you see in her trash can) won\u2019t be missed if you opt for a family event instead of a family dinner as a gathering. Even more, these get-togethers also tend to be loaded with lots of alcohol, a special kind of landmine for those who struggle with drinking too much.\n\nInstead, we need to encourage people to erect personal boundaries around what is and is not acceptable eating behavior for them, and we need to honor those boundaries when people try to declare them. If a friend or family member says that they\u2019re full, offering seconds isn\u2019t helpful if they\u2019ve already declined. If someone tells you that one drink is enough, don't offer again under the guise that it's the holiday party. And understand that it\u2019s OK to say no. (But if saying no to food is a sore spot for you, eating something hearty like a bowl of steel-cut oatmeal before you go makes it much easier to decline extras.)\n\nThe holiday season started a bit early this year, so to speak, and perhaps that\u2019s because people are feeling as if they\u2019re in dire need of what this time of year gives them \u2014 good cheer, a sense of community and a reason to be happy when it might feel otherwise difficult. Let\u2019s try to set aside the anxiety around food and enjoy the best part of this time of year: The hugs, the kisses, the laughter and the good vibes from people we love.\n\nAnd, if it happens over a slice of pie, it\u2019s okay! A small slice won\u2019t truly last a lifetime \u2014 but the memories will, and that\u2019s what matters most."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "David K.

OPEC member Venezuela is in the grips of a prolonged recession, its economy dogged by hyperinflation and food shortages.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s Republican administration has already imposed sanctions on dozens of Venezuelan officials, and has sought to disrupt the country\u2019s growing gold exports and access to external financing as part of a pressure campaign against Maduro.\n\nThe potential human rights-related sanctions would target Cuban officials, possibly including generals, who Washington accuses of advising Venezuela\u2019s government on how to monitor opponents and put down street protests, the source said.\n\nThe number and identities of the potential targets was unclear. No final decision has yet been made on whether and when to impose the sanctions.\n\nThe measures would cast a further chill on U.S.-Cuba relations, where Trump has rolled back some of former President Barack Obama\u2019s moves aimed at forging closer ties, and also fuel Maduro\u2019s assertion that Washington is bent on undermining his government for ideological reasons.\n\nCuba and Venezuela became close allies under the rule of late Presidents Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez. Since a series of bilateral agreements in 2000, the communist island\u2019s economy depends heavily on Venezuelan crude oil, which Havana compensates for by providing Venezuela with Cuban doctors and other services.\n\nThe United States and Venezuelan opposition politicians have long maintained that Cuban military and intelligence officials advise Maduro\u2019s government and security forces on the crackdown.\n\nWhile Maduro often travels to Havana and the Cuban ambassador is a frequent guest at government meetings in Caracas, the extent of Cuba\u2019s influence on and support for Venezuela\u2019s government and military is not publicly known.\n\nThere are questions about how effective measures targeting Cuban officials would be.\n\nHuman rights-related sanctions typically freeze assets, seize property, block travel in the United States and prohibit U.S. business dealings with the targets. However, given Washington has maintained a six-decade financial and trade embargo on Cuba, few if any Cuban officials are believed to have a sizeable financial presence in the United States.\n\nThe White House declined comment in response to Reuters questions about possible Cuba sanctions.\n\nIn the past, Maduro has blasted sanctions as \u201cimperialist\u201d moves designed to complicate financial transactions, including food imports and bond payments. He has also derided U.S. sanctions on himself and other Venezuelan officials as ineffective and a badge of honor.\n\nMaduro\u2019s government has been criticized by Washington, the European Union and Latin American neighbors for overriding Venezuela\u2019s opposition-led Congress, jailing opponents, using excessive force against protesters and failing to allow the entry of foreign humanitarian aid to ease the economic crisis.\n\n\u2018Troika of tyranny\u2019\n\nThe Trump administration has in the past floated the idea of sanctions that were not ultimately rolled out, and Washington has stressed it wants to minimize harm to Venezuelan people.\n\nAsked about possible sanctions on Cuban officials, a senior U.S. government official told Reuters in early November: \u201cWe are looking at all the potential avenues to deter those who are really helping the Maduro regime stay afloat and giving them the tools they need for repression.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser John Bolton said earlier this month Washington would take a tougher line against Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, calling them a \u201cTroika of Tyranny.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Venezuelan regime\u2019s repression is of course enabled by the Cuban dictatorship,\u201d Bolton said during a speech in Miami, home to a diaspora of Venezuelans and Cubans who have historically been a bedrock of Republican support in swing state Florida.\n\n\u201cThe United States calls on all nations in the region to face this obvious truth, and let the Cuban regime know that it will be held responsible for continued oppression in Venezuela,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nTrump\u2019s top Latin America adviser, Mauricio Claver-Carone, is a Cuban-American who was opposed to Obama\u2019s historic opening to Cuba after a 2014 diplomatic breakthrough between the two Cold War foes.\n\nSeparately, the United States is considering adding Venezuela to its list of state sponsors of terrorism, two people familiar with the deliberations said earlier this week, although a U.S. official said it could be difficult for the Trump administration to provide concrete proof.\n\nSuch a designation could further limit U.S. assistance to Venezuela and impose new restrictions on financial transactions.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dartunorro Clark and Marianna Sotomayor", "title": "Ocasio-Cortez backs Pelosi for speaker as Dem rebellion falters", "description": "Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on Wednesday threw her support behind Nancy Pelosi's campaign to become majority speaker next session amid a faltering rebellion against her speakership.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/ocasio-cortez-backs-pelosi-speaker-dem-rebellion-falters-n939086", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2654966/181121-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-se-342p_d3adc871238660fb833bf7612462ab9c.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:14:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

For example, the gap in the number of Bachelor\u2019s degrees among Latinos compared to whites went from 30 to 31 percentage points in the last 10 years.\n\nLittle mentoring, college prep, college transfers\n\nThe report found stark differences between California high schools that serve Latino students and those that serve predominantly white students, including a differential of 100 points in SAT scores and almost double the number of students at Hispanic high schools.\n\nThe report also found a lack of mentoring programs and recommended increasing these, especially for minority students. Only 39 percent of the state's Latino high school students had completed the paperwork to be able to attend a four-year state college, and too many Hispanics were enrolled in remedial programs.\n\nThough an increasing number of Hispanic students are transferring from community colleges to public four-year state universities, the report criticized current numbers \u2014 only two percent of Latino students transferred after two years in a community college and less than a third (31 percent) transferred in six years.\n\nOne of the recommendations is to strengthen and facilitate these transfer programs.\n\nAn emphasis on transferring Latino students to four-year institutions \u2014 and then monitoring college completion \u2014 has long been advocated by groups like Excelencia.\n\n\u201cColleges and universities need to go beyond enrolling Latino students,\u201d said Deborah Santiago, CEO of Excelencia in Education during a recent conference in Washington, DC. \u201cInstitutions need to respond to changing demographics and serve their Latino students more effectively.\u201d\n\nAnother issue, the California report found, was cost. While the state is generous with financial aid \u2014 almost two-thirds of community college students, for example, pay no tuition \u2014 Latino students often struggle with paying for books and housing.\n\nMore than 65 percent of all Latino students, who comprise the biggest and fastest-growing group in higher education, currently attend Hispanic Serving Institutions or HSIs, defined as colleges and universities where more than a quarter of the student population is Hispanic.\n\nBut according to Siqueiros, an increase in Latino college degree attainment \u2014 in California and nationwide \u2014 requires higher education institutions and policy makers to make sure universities \u201cbecome Hispanic Graduating Institutions, not just Hispanic Serving.\u201d\n\nNationally, Excelencia in Education launched an initiative last month called The Seal of Excelencia. It seeks to credential colleges and universities that use evidence-based practices and data as well as leadership that is actively committed to graduating more Latinos.\n\n\u201cIt demonstrates the commitment to raise the bar and measure how effectively institutions serve Latino students through degree completion,\u201d said Brown.\n\nEducators see California as a test case \u2014 it needs 60 percent of its adults to have a college degree, and this means putting a focus on Latino completion.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Weather threatens Macy's Parade", "description": "Final preparations are underway ahead of the 92nd Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, but cold, windy weather could put a damper on the festivities.

Of course, Black Friday is no longer just one day; it\u2019s now an ongoing event that starts right after Halloween. Serious bargain hunters have already done some early Black Friday shopping.\n\nMajor retailers, such as Kohl\u2019s, JCPenney, Costco, Target and Amazon, have already launched some of their Black Friday deals. More major retail chain stores will roll out deals and doorbusters on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really become Black November,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, chief industry adviser for the NPD Group. \u201cRetailers realize that we don\u2019t have any more money just because they start their sales earlier; it\u2019s all about market share and trying to capture that early dollar.\u201d\n\nIs this marketing frenzy, combined with a seemingly endless number of sales throughout the year, tarnishing the allure of Black Friday?\n\nAbout half of the consumers surveyed in mid-October by WalletHub said Black Friday no longer offers the best deals of the year.\n\nFor its new report, 2018\u2019s Best Stores for Black Friday, WalletHub compared the regular price with the Black Friday price for a broad selection of items, including TVs, computers, home appliances, video games, clothing and jewelry. The result: 14 percent of the items \u201coffered no savings\u201d \u2014 had the same price or were more expensive when compared with their pre-Black Friday prices.\n\nThat said, shopping experts contacted by NBC News did expect to see some great deals unveiled on Wednesday and Thursday on all types of merchandise.\n\nEdgar Dworsky, founder of ConsumerWorld.org considers Black Friday \u201cthe single best shopping day of the year.\u201d\n\nAngela Davis, who runs the website FrugalLivingNW, said she \u201cloves Black Friday\u201d because it\u2019s not just about buying Christmas presents.\n\n\u201cI do a lot of my personal clothing shopping for winter during Black Friday week,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are big deals on clothing, shoes and accessories \u2014 winter jackets and boots, tons of women's clothes. Deals on small kitchen appliances are nuts over Black Friday, as well as crazy deals on tools and large kitchen appliances.\u201d\n\nDo your homework\n\nWe all love to save money, and retailers are working overtime to build excitement for their sales.\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t get caught up in the hysteria,\u201d Dworsky said. \u201cSome circulars are 60 or 70 pages long. Clearly every one of these items is not a great deal.\u201d\n\nTo cut through the Black Friday marketing hype, you need to do your homework before you go shopping. Consumer World\u2019s \u201c10 Tips to Bag a Bargain During Black Friday Week\u201d include:\n\nRead the ads: Find scans of ad circulars for dozens of major retailers at BFAds.net. Check websites for your favorite stores for additional \u201chidden\u201d bargains and look for coupons listed on their social media sites. The Black Friday Charts at gottadeal.com let you search deals on specific items by store or product and then sort them by price.\n\nEvaluate the deals: Use a pricing tool such as Google Shopping and CamelCamelCamel to separate the good sales from the ho-hum.\n\nResearch the product: \u201cA low price on a lousy product is no bargain,\u201d Dworsky cautions. Read the reviews posted at online stores, but if it\u2019s a significant purchase, like a television, computer or home appliance, check for professional reviews from trusted sites, such as Consumer Reports, Wirecutter, or PCMag.com.\n\n\u201cA lot of the doorbuster deals we see on electronic items may not really be the products you want to own, so it's a good idea to check the specs,\u201d Jim Willcox, senior electronic editor at Consumer Reports, told NBC News.\n\nDiscounted computers may have slower processors or less storage. Some doorbuster TVs are made especially for Black Friday. These so-called \u201cderivatives\u201d have unique model numbers, so it\u2019s impossible to find reviews.\n\n\u201cThese derivative models come out right before Black Friday, so you don't know how they're going to perform,\u201d Willcox said. \u201cThat\u2019s especially true of secondary and tertiary brands where you may see low prices, but don't know how good they really are.\u201d\n\nTIP: The best prices on top-of-the-line televisions are typically found during the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl and again in late February and March (when stores want to clear out last year\u2019s models), according to Consumer Reports.\n\nDo you really need to go to the stores?\n\nFor many, shopping after Thanksgiving dinner or camping out to hit the stores early Black Friday morning is a tradition they wouldn\u2019t miss. Retailers hope their doorbusters will get you in the store, where you\u2019ll be tempted to buy more expensive items.\n\nKeep in mind: Doorbuster deals on big electronic items are often \u201climited quantity\u201d at most stores, so unless you camp out overnight and are at the front of the line when the doors open, you\u2019ll miss out. And typically, there aren\u2019t any rain checks for these offers.\n\nWhile some doorbuster deals are only available at the store, most of the things you want are probably online, shopping experts say, as retailers try to build up their online business.\n\n\u201cI fully endorse the people doing it for the fun of it, but the amount of money that you can really save isn\u2019t worth the hassle to me and the fight to try to get the deal,\u201d said Frugal Living NW\u2019s Davis.\n\nFrank Behring, who handles Black Friday sales comparison charts for gottadeal.com, said he\u2019s noticed fewer in-store doorbuster deals.\n\n\u201cEverything is going online now, so there are what you might call online doorbusters,\u201d Behring told NBC News. \u201cYou have to be online at a specific time. And it\u2019s not just Thanksgiving or Black Friday, some of these deals went live on Monday.\u201d\n\nMany of these online deals are available for a limited time, sometimes for only four or five hours.\n\nIf you really want a specific computer or television model, don\u2019t wait too long. Quantities on some of these online doorbusters are limited, and the seller may run out. E-commerce sites sometimes cancel completed orders when they run out of supply.\n\n\u201cIt happened a lot last year,\u201d Behring said. \u201cOnce they realize they don\u2019t have enough supply, they\u2019ll send out an email that says your order has been cancelled, and by then the doorbuster is no longer available.\u201d\n\nIf you miss a deal on Black Friday, especially on an electronic product, check again on Cyber Monday. Many of the deals on Cyber Monday are similar to those on Black Friday, shopping experts told NBC News.\n\nHerb Weisbaum is The ConsumerMan.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nLAWRENCE, Mass. \u2014 Families in the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts are facing a challenging Thanksgiving more than two months after natural gas explosions and fires leveled homes and left thousands without heat or hot water.\n\nMore than 2,000 homes are still without gas service in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover after gas lines were overpressurized during an otherwise routine pipeline replacement project, triggering dozens of explosions and fires.\n\nWhile some residents have chosen to tough it out in chilly homes, more than 1,500 are spending the holiday in hotels, apartments and trailers paid for by Columbia Gas.\n\nThe utility company is responsible for the Sept. 13 fires that killed one, injured dozens and destroyed or damaged more than 100 structures.\n\nAt the trailer park set up on Lawrence's South Common, Jose Grullon said his family's holiday would be more modest than usual.\n\nThe 45-year-old, his pregnant wife and two young children moved into a trailer last month after it became too cold in their apartment. Like most affected homes, theirs didn't suffer any fires or explosions, but the hot water heater, boiler and other gas appliances were compromised by the over-pressurization and need to be replaced before gas service can be restored.\n\nGrullon said their space is simply too small to host the festive party with food from his native Dominican Republic, dancing and music that he normally throws for family and friends. The family will instead eat the turkey dinner Columbia Gas is providing to trailer residents.\n\n\"It's not going to be a happy mood at all,\" he said. \"It's going to be a sad situation.\"\n\nBut fellow trailer park resident Socorro Guzman had a more positive outlook.\n\nGuzman, 72, said she'll be thanking God simply because her family survived. She'll be hosting about a dozen people. \"It's a small place, but we have to celebrate.\"\n\nComplicating matters is that temperatures are forecast to drop into the 20s.\n\nOfficials are concerned about water pipes and tanks freezing, so they're adding insulation under trailers and making sure every unit has sufficient propane for heating.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be cold, but most people don't spend the winter in an RV,\" said Scott Ferson, a spokesman for Columbia Gas. \"So it has provided some unique challenges.\"\n\nIn the meantime, utility crews are pressing on with restoration work throughout the affected communities.\n\nNatural gas contract worker Jary Pena, of Andover, Massachusetts, and co-workers remove a boiler from from the home of Patty and Barry McCloskey in Andover on Nov. 8, 2018. Steven Senne / AP file\n\nAfter missing a Nov. 19 deadline, Columbia Gas now says the region's gas service should be fully restored by December.\n\nColumbia Gas, which also faces federal probes and class-action lawsuits, quickly replaced nearly miles of old gas lines, but restoring service to individual buildings has been more arduous.\n\nMost appliances using natural gas are being replaced and the region's old housing stock presents additional challenges.\n\n\"We're finding a lot of code issues,\" said Ferson. \"Each house needs to be addressed almost individually.\"\n\nEven after heat and hot water was restored in some places, many residents say they still face an incomplete Thanksgiving.\n\nPatty McCloskey got her gas service back to her Andover home earlier this month after workers spent three days removing and replacing her antiquated boiler and hot water heater.\n\nShe's grateful she no longer has to wear multiple sweaters to keep warm inside, but won't be hosting Thanksgiving as usual because her damaged stove won't be replaced for weeks.\n\nPatty McCloskey, of Andover, speaks with natural gas contract workers after they removed a boiler and hot water heater from her home on Nov. 8, 2018. Steven Senne / AP file\n\nMcCloskey said her husband and her two grown daughters will instead take the gas company up on its free meal.\n\n\"This has been the most unusual experience of our life,\" the 71-year-old retiree said. \"The most draining part wasn't so much the cold. It was the anxiety of not knowing what was going to happen next and how it was going to be resolved. It was exhausting.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Maggie Fox\n\nCalifornia may be the source of romaine lettuce blamed in an outbreak of E. coli infections that has made 32 people sick in 11 states and Canada, the head of the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday.\n\nThe FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have cautioned people not to eat romaine lettuce while they investigate the outbreak. It\u2019s very similar to an outbreak of E. coli that killed one person and made at least 25 people ill last year, FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said. That outbreak was traced to leafy green vegetables but not to romaine lettuce specifically.\n\n\u201cThe strain that caused that outbreak is very similar to the one that\u2019s causing this outbreak and the timing is exactly the same. So it\u2019s likely associated with end-of-season harvests in California, where most of the romaine that is currently on the market is from,\u201d Gottlieb told NBC News.\n\n\u201cI think we are going to be in a position to isolate the region soon. There is some lettuce coming in from Mexico but most of what\u2019s on the market is the result of end-of-the-season harvesting coming out of California right now.\u201d\n\nGottlieb wrote in a tweet Friday that the contamination was \"likely\" from California and that the goal was to rid the market of possibly contaminated lettuce and replace it with romaine grown elsewhere. He added that the CDC is looking to take steps to improve labeling to make it clear where and when lettuce was harvested.\n\nThis is the second outbreak of E. coli linked to romaine lettuce this year. An outbreak this past spring killed five people and made 210 sick in 36 states. It was eventually traced to contaminated canal water in a farming area in Yuma, Arizona.\n\nUntil a specific farm or region can be identified, CDC and FDA say it\u2019s safest just to tell people not to eat romaine lettuce and to tell restaurants and stores to throw it out. Other leafy greens appear to be safe.\n\nAlthough this is the second romaine-linked outbreak this year, it is not clear whether romaine lettuce itself is more likely to be contaminated than other vegetables, said Dr. Laura Gieraltowski, leader of the foodborne outbreak response team at the CDC. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve been asking,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt could have to do with the way the lettuce is shaped. (A head of) romaine lettuce is kind of open and maybe contaminated water can get into it more than into a head of iceberg lettuce or cabbage that is in a ball.\u201d\n\nAnd like many other foods, romaine is often processed and repackaged before it ships out to grocery stores and restaurants.\n\n\u201cIs romaine somehow riskier? We don\u2019t think so,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe think it is probably related more to the way that it is packaged.\u201d So pieces of a single contaminated head of romaine could be chopped up and spread through a number of packages.\n\nWhat is known is where E. coli comes from. Like so many other bacteria that contaminate food, it comes from fecal matter. Wild animals may roam through fields, or irrigation water might flow from nearby pastures or feedlots where livestock is raised. Contamination can be further spread when produce is harvested and passes through machinery to clean, trim, chop and package it.\n\nTracking down the source is time consuming, which is why the FDA has not announced a mandatory recall yet, Gottlieb said. But he said some growers and distributors were planning to voluntarily recall their romaine products later Wednesday.\n\nWhile it may seem that there have been more food recalls lately, both the FDA and CDC say that\u2019s not because more food is being contaminated. \u201cThe food supply in the U.S. is one of the safest in the world,\u201d Gieraltowski said.\n\nRather, FDA and CDC are better at finding ways to link the 48 million cases of food poisoning that occur each year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that there are more outbreaks. It\u2019s that we are identifying more outbreaks,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\n\u201cA lot of what we identify now would have been random people showing up at their doctor\u2019s office with gastrointestinal illness that we would never have associated with a common etiology (cause),\u201d Gottlieb added.\n\nGenetic fingerprinting has changed that.\n\n\u201cBut now that we\u2019re taking samples and looking at bacteria \u2026 we are seeing that it\u2019s the same bug and that clues in researchers at the CDC that there\u2019s one common element, that there\u2019s one genetic fingerprinting, that it\u2019s coming from the same source. We are seeing that it's the same bug.\"\n\nThe next step is speeding up the slow process of tracking the sources of the outbreaks using better technology to keep tabs on food as it moves from farms to distributors and to stores, Gottlieb said.\n\nContaminated food is an extremely common problem. The CDC estimates that germs in food make 48 million Americans sick every year \u2014 that\u2019s one out of six people. About 128,000 are made sick enough to be hospitalized, and 3,000 die."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Dolce & Gabbana accused of insulting China, blames hackers", "description": "The screenshots appear to show Stefano Gabbana referring to China with crude terms as he defended promotional videos that had sparked controversy earlier.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/dolce-gabbana-calls-china-show-amid-accusations-racism-social-media-n939036", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2654811/181121-stefano-gabbana-domenico-dolce-ew-210p_ccde9fa5d3c4e6b5e6284b0d33d97eb4.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:27:00Z", "content": "Nov. 21, 2018 / 7:27 PM GMT BEIJING The Italian luxury fashion house Dolce &amp; Gabbana apologized Wednesday for insulting remarks about China it allegedly made in exchanges on Instagram but claimed its accounts had been hacked.

She and her family have had to live with the risk and manage the toll.\n\nOprah Winfrey talks with former first lady Michelle Obama as she begins her book tour. Kamil Krzaczynski / Reuters\n\nWhat Obama described is at once a distinct experience \u2014 that of the only black First Family \u2014 and a common part of black American life. Violence, property crimes, threats and other offenses inspired by racial animus amounted to the most frequent type of hate crime reported in the FBI\u2019s most recent tally of bias crimes. In fact, black Americans have been the most frequent victims of hate crime in every tally of bias incidents generated since the FBI began collecting such data in the early 1990s.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that is amazing about black experiences in America is that the country wants to at once send you very clear messages that you don\u2019t belong,\u201d said Koritha Mitchell, an associate processor of English at Ohio State University who researches hate crimes and their depiction in literature. \u201cThat you should expect and accept some kind of half measure of citizenship and then pretend that the country did not send you that message.\"\n\nShe added: \"There is this constant demand for our silence about what we experience and, failing that, our forgiveness before our loved one\u2019s bodies are in the ground. It\u2019s like a form of national gaslighting.\u201d\n\nWhatever does Mitchell mean? Let us return to the Obamas. As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama received such an intense barrage of threats that his campaign was forced to request Secret Service protection earlier than any other candidate in U.S. history. But, once elected \u2014 with the votes of people of color and a minority of white voters \u2014 the now laughable notion of a post-racial society proliferated far and wide.\n\nIn 2015, when the nation\u2019s current surge in hate crime began, Donald Trump announced his run for president. He did so with a speech which, among other things described Mexican immigrants as rapists.\n\nOne day later, Dylann Roof, a white nationalist, attended a prayer meeting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina. He had spent the preceding months touring plantations and Confederate monuments, and then drafted an online manifesto littered with white nationalist ideas, including a call for a race war. At the church, he and shot and killed nine black people. In the first days after the attack, some elected officials insisted the crime had been motivated by anti-Christian, rather than racist ideas.\n\nPhotographs of the nine victims killed at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston are held up during a prayer vigil in Washington in 2015. Win McNamee / Getty Images file\n\n\u201cIt has been the case historically, and certainly since we started to get valid statistical information on hate crimes, that African Americans have been the group most frequently targeted,\u201d said Jack McDevitt, director of the Institute of Race and Justice at Northeastern University.\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s basic problem with diversity started with slavery and, well, Native American slaughter,\u201d McDevitt said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the public discourse, at present, is quite anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican, specifically, but it\u2019s not as if people who perpetrate hate crimes really specialize or want others here either.\u201d\n\nMcDevitt worked with the FBI to develop the reporting system for the annual hate crimes tally. The report is itself a compromise in lieu of a federal hate crimes law. (Such a law eventually passed and was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2009.) When McDevitt began that work with the FBI, it wasn\u2019t unusual to encounter police officers and local law enforcement officials who were dubious about the existence of hate crime or the need to investigate and track it in any particular way, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I think has happened \u2014 and you see this in the uptick in agencies sharing information with the FBI this year \u2014 is that there\u2019s been a real increase in understanding that bias crimes hurt whole groups of people. They, by design, terrify.\u201d\n\nThe annual FBI hate crimes report remains important precisely because it clearly demonstrates what is actually happening in the United States, said Kami Chavis, professor of law and director of the criminal justice program at Wake Forest University.\n\nIn 2017, African Americans comprised 13 percent of the nation\u2019s population and 28 percent of all hate crime victims, according to a report released by the FBI last week. As hate crimes against other groups have surged in the last three years, bias-driven crimes directed at black Americans have declined but continued to outnumber any other form of hate crime.\n\n\u201cThe hate crimes report is the moment where we as a country have to say, gee, what\u2019s happened in the last couple of years?\" Chavis said. \"At this moment, there are a lot of things that could explain this but, I don\u2019t think that it is a coincidence that our political rhetoric is so coarse.\"\n\nIf you create an environment that tolerates violence and targeting of people based on their membership in a group, she said, \"this surge in hate crimes and this consistent burden on African Americans is exactly what you get.\u201d\n\nBrian Levin, director of the University of California, San Bernardino Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, parses hate crimes data and the social conditions which seem to feed them. Some of the patterns that Levin has spotted in hate crime in the past add some weight to the theory that Trump\u2019s rhetoric and the rise of white nationalist behavior are driving all sorts of hate crimes in the present.\n\nFor example, the single worst month in anti-black hate crimes came in July 1996, one month before President Bill Clinton signed a welfare-reform bill into law. That summer, conversations about supposed welfare queens, and ostensibly fecund and lazy blacks, were not difficult to encounter.\n\nMore recently, when Levin worked with a research partner, Jim Nolan, a sociologist with the West Virginia University Research Center on Violence, the men discovered that Nov. 10, 2016 \u2014 the day after Trump\u2019s election \u2014 marked the apex of the single worst month in hate crime the country had seen in 14 years.\n\nWhite nationalists march at the University of Virginia on the eve of a \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville in 2017. Alejandro Alvarez / Reuters file\n\nBeyond the hate crimes statistics, Levin said he sees strong and more terrifying indications that we are living in an era of \u201cascendant white nationalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of them, without question, is that white nationalist ideology has become accepted as mainstream political thinking,\u201d Levin said. \"We have, at this point, a socio-political movement framed around racial resentment, fear of economic and social change and clinging to certain expectations. And that stuff is not called racism, it\u2019s not called what it is.\u201d\n\nIn the period between the early 1900s and 1930s, the Klu Klux Klan perfected the art of more subtle but racist critiques of things like \u201cjazz culture,\u201d \u201cforeign influences,\u201d and describing social change as a assault on \u201ctraditional\u201d and core \u201cAmerican values,\u201d Levin said. Today, white nationalist groups are making similar arguments in politics, in their own fast-growing social media spaces and in the pages of major news publications, Levin said.\n\nBut as dire as Levin\u2019s analysis of the present moment may sound, he also sees hints of good news. In 1996, 42 percent of all hate crimes in the United States were directed at African Americans. This year, though bias-driven crimes directed at African Americans remain the single largest category of hate crime, that same figure has declined to 28 percent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be excessively cheerful,\u201d said Levin. \u201cBut what I am saying is 42 percent is a cancer that is going to consume the country. At 28 percent, we can do chemo.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Suzy Khimm and Kalhan Rosenblatt", "title": "Survivors of California's Camp Fire struggle to find housing", "description": "FEMA has given out $4.95 million in housing assistance so far in Butte County, but many fire survivors are still scrambling for a place to live.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/where-s-everybody-going-go-survivors-california-s-camp-fire-n938991", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2650421/181116-paradise-fire-2-ew-748p_353896afbf6ec27dfe8734bd53086157.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:05:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Suzy Khimm and Kalhan Rosenblatt\n\nAfter fleeing California\u2019s devastating Camp Fire, Victor Marino set up a tent in behind a church in Oroville, where he slept last week even as the temperature dropped into the 40s.\n\nHe posted a plea for help on a Facebook group for survivors, and a stranger paid for him to stay in a motel for a few nights this week. But he can only stay there until Thanksgiving \u2014 and he has no idea where he\u2019s going to sleep next.\n\nMarino, 26, is one of more than 13,000 evacuees in Butte County who have applied to FEMA for disaster assistance to help with housing and other basic needs after the worst fire in California's history, which left at least 83 dead and 563 possibly missing as of Wednesday night. Like many of those who were displaced, he is still stuck in limbo and scrambling for a place to live.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people displaced out of their homes \u2014 where\u2019s everybody going to go?\u201d said Marino, who worked as a handyman and property manager at a trailer park in Magalia.\n\nFEMA told Marino on Wednesday that he would receive $847 for one month of housing assistance, he said. But since he doesn\u2019t have a bank account, FEMA said it would have to send the money directly to his mailing address \u2014 at the trailer park that he had to flee. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for the money they are going to help me with, but I\u2019m going to have to jump through hoops all over again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Camp Fire destroyed 13,500 homes, and FEMA says that it has given out $4.95 million in housing assistance in Butte County so far, which includes money for temporary housing in hotels, rental apartments and Airbnbs, as well as home repairs. The assistance aims to give evacuees a more stable place to live beyond the emergency shelters, which have experienced outbreaks of norovirus, among other challenges.\n\nFire survivors can apply for assistance at a disaster recovery center FEMA set up at the shopping mall in Chico, where people can also connect with private disaster relief efforts. The California Community Foundation, for example, has raised $5 million so far for wildfire survivors' housing, medical assistance and other basic needs.\n\nJeremie Saylors, 11, walks through the burned remains of his home in Paradise, California, on Nov. 18, 2018.

Nichole Jolly, 34, had a rental property in Paradise that was destroyed, and she is also displaced from her home in Magalia, which has smoke damage that she's waiting for her insurance company to assess. She said FEMA denied her request for displacement assistance since she has insurance coverage and a home to return to, even though she told them she can't go back yet.\n\nFEMA says its mission is to focus on assisting those who don\u2019t have homeowner\u2019s or rental insurance. The agency offered Jolly a low-interest disaster loan, but she said she can't afford to take one out. \"We don't want to go into debt,\" she said.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people in the same boat,\" said Ron Zimmer, pastor of Chico\u2019s East Ave Church, which is sheltering survivors. \"The lines are so long, it takes most of a day just to register with FEMA and nobody knows exactly what FEMA is supposed to do for them.\" Marino said FEMA denied his initial application for help replacing the motor home he lived in since the vehicle wasn\u2019t registered under his name in California.\n\nThose who receive housing assistance will still need to find a place to stay in a region that was already facing a serious housing shortage even before disaster struck. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a whole bunch of vacant homes to be rented or thousands of hotel rooms at that scale,\u201d said Amie Fishman, executive director of the Non-Profit Housing Association of Northern California, which advocates for affordable housing.\n\n\"It's not the typical renting time right now. You get all excited and you find something, but then you call and they say you're number 150 on the list,\" said Monica Evans, 44, a Paradise resident with three daughters who is searching for housing.\n\nTera Hickerson, right, and Columbus Holt embrace as they look at a board with information for services at a makeshift encampment outside a Walmart store for people displaced by the Camp Fire. John Locher / AP\n\nFEMA is working with state officials to develop a plan for bringing manufactured housing and trailers to the area, \u201cevaluating each survivor\u2019s housing needs\u201d to determine how many units are needed, according to FEMA spokesman Bradly Pierce.\n\nIn the meantime, the agency is encouraging evacuees to look farther afield for somewhere to stay. \u201cWe realize there are availability issues in Butte County, so survivors having difficulty locating rooms there have the option of staying in Sacramento and surrounding cities as well,\u201d said Pierce, pointing to a website with FEMA-approved hotels.\n\nBut Sacramento is 90 miles away from Chico, where many Camp Fire survivors are staying. For evacuees like Marino who lost their vehicles, even getting across town to another shelter or to pick up donated supplies can be daunting. \u201cThe biggest problem is transportation because everything is so spread out,\u201d he said.\n\nJessica Kester, 29, applied through FEMA\u2019s website for rental assistance and heard on Friday that it was approved. She\u2019s now planning to move into a townhouse in the town of Willow with her husband, 18-month-old daughter, and two nieces. Her monthly rent will be $350 more than she was paying in Paradise, so the assistance \u201cwas really, really helpful,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one normally just has that extra money.\u201d\n\nZimmer, the local pastor, worries about what will happen to those who can\u2019t find a more stable place to live soon. \u201cHow many of these people living on the cusp already will become a new wave of homeless?\u201d\n\nMarino has a GoFundMe page that\u2019s helped him raise $200 to buy a new RV. But he\u2019s more concerned about other families from his trailer park that he is trying to help, with children as young as 2. \u201cOne of them is a family of five, and they\u2019re sleeping outside,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s started raining today.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Jasmin Boyce", "title": "'Relatively few' Twitter bots were needed to spread misinformation and overwhelm fact checkers, study finds", "description": "A small number of automated Twitter accounts were able to play an outsized role in spreading content from low-quality publishers and overwhelm the efforts of fact checkers, according to a new study.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/relatively-few-twitter-bots-were-needed-spread-misinformation-overwhelm-fact-n939021", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/2617306/181024-twitter-illustration-ew-307p_481a294d78e52cd7d887484f2306a4e2.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:00:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Twitter has removed tens of millions of accounts in 2018.\n\nA spokesperson for Twitter pointed NBC News to the company\u2019s blog post from June in which it detailed its efforts to fight bots.\n\nThe study analyzed 14 million tweets that linked to more than 400,000 articles from May 2016 until the end of March 2017. Of those articles, 389,569 were from \u201clow credibility sources\u201d that had been repeatedly flagged by fact-checking organizations for containing misinformation, as well as 15,053 articles that originated from \u201cfact-checking sources.\u201d\n\nOf that sample, over 13.6 million tweets linked to \u201clow-credibility sources\u201d and around 1.1 million tweets linked to known fact-checking sources, leading researchers to attribute greater virality with \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nTo achieve maximum exposure, the study found that \u201csocial bots\u201d used two methods to manipulate users into trusting the linked article\u2019s validity.\n\n\u201cFirst, bots are particularly active in amplifying content in the very early spreading moments, before an article goes \u2018viral,\u2019\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cSecond, bots target influential users through replies and mentions.\u201d\n\nThe researchers noted how one social bot mentioned President Donald Trump\u2019s official twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, in 19 twitter posts that each linked to one article that falsely claimed undocumented immigrants submitted millions of votes. Researchers suggested that this is done by bots hoping \u201cthese targets will then reshare the content to their followers, thus boosting its credibility.\u201d\n\nUsers struggled to differentiate bots from other human users, as humans \u201chave retweeted bots who post low-credibility content almost as much as they retweet other humans,\u201d according to the researchers.\n\nThe researchers noted that social media platforms have moved to address the spread of misinformation by bots, but said \u201ctheir effectiveness is hard to evaluate.\u201d\n\nJosh Russell, an independent researcher who studies misinformation campaigns, said the study highlighted the need for Twitter to act quickly in taking down fake accounts.\n\n\u201cTwitter has been great at taking down user-reported bots,\u201d Russell said via a Twitter direct message. \u201cThey just need to improve the detection system.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "David K.

While heavy seasonal dishes and an abundance of cookie trays are surely to blame, the cocktail you\u2019re sipping on the side is adding some liquid calories to your tally that many people overlook.\n\nA cocktail can run you anywhere from 100 calories for a simple vodka-soda to over 300 calories for a holiday specialty like spiked eggnog. But it doesn\u2019t seem that the empty calories are deterring us from imbibing: Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year\u2019s top the list for the highest grossing sales of wine and spirits. And according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a quarter of the $49-billion-a-year distilled spirits industry\u2019s profits come from the month between Thanksgiving and the New Year.\n\n\u201cThere are a few reasons it pays to be a little less jolly over the holidays. For one, calories from the extra drinks can really add up, especially if you're drinking sugary cocktails. Plus, drinking lowers our inhibitions so while you might have had every intention to say no thank you to dessert, a few drinks in might weaken your resolve,\u201d says Samantha Cassetty, RD. \u201cOn top of that, overdoing it can interfere with restorative sleep, which can then mess with your appetite-regulating hormones and drive cravings for less healthy food. Plus, sugary cocktails tend to produce worse hangovers, and when was the last time you reached for a big salad with lean protein after a night of excessive drinking?\u201d\n\nWhile keeping our consumption in check is important, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to miss out on all the fun. Cassetty reminds us that the daily recommended intake for alcohol caps women at one drink per day and men at two. When you do choose to imbibe, reach for a cocktail that is low in added sugars and make it festive with these easy tricks.\n\nTips for a Healthier Holiday Sip\n\n\u201cWhen you're hitting the party circuit, don't forget that most drinks are customizable to include less simple syrup or flavored mix-ins. It never hurts to ask!\u201d says Cassetty. \u201cFinally, I always suggest holding off on cocktails until you're starting your main course. This helps slow down drinking and helps you stay within limits without being a total scrooge!\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re hosting a cocktail party or holiday dinner, getting creative with your ice cubes is one way to keep the evening festive while cutting back on added sugars.\n\nFruit ice cubes made with 100% cranberry juice. Emily Slawek\n\nMixer cubes: \u201cMaking cocktail ice cubes keeps things festive and provides a punch of flavor so you can limit the sugary mix-ins,\u201d says Cassetty. \u201c100 percent fruit juice is naturally sweet \u2014 it doesn't contain any added sugar \u2014 so it's a healthier alternative to traditional cocktail mixers.\u201d Simply freeze the juice of your choice into ice cube trays; once frozen, drop it into a glass, add liquor of choice, and top with club soda for a light and refreshing sip.\n\nCranberry, rosemary and mint ice cubes. Emily Slawek\n\nHerbs and fruit: \u201cCombining fresh fruit and herbs is another way to liven up your drink without ramping up your sugar intake,\u201d says Cassetty. You can always drop them into the bottom of your glass and muddle them into your cocktail, but we prefer taking it a step further and freezing them into ice cubes. It adds a fun pop of color to your glass and will feel festive for your guests \u2014 and as they melt they infuse even more flavor into your drink! Plus, it\u2019s a great way to use up leftover herbs that would otherwise get tossed. Simply rip herbs into small pieces and dice larger fruit like oranges or lemons (berries can remain whole), drop into an ice cube tray, fill to the top with water, and freeze.\n\nBe the hostess with the mostess\n\nSo watch out for added sugars and don\u2019t go overboard at the open bar at your office holiday party \u2014 got it. But the holidays are a time for gathering and celebrating with those we love, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with indulging a little on a festive sip. Cassetty\u2019s philosophy is always \u201ceverything in moderation,\u201d and when we do indulge, she encourages us to make it worth every bite (or sip).\n\n\u201cIf you'd feel like you were really missing out by passing up on a specialty cocktail, then by all means, enjoy it,\u201d says Cassetty. \u201cTake a mindful approach to your drinks and your food and decide which ones are worth the splurge and which ones don't excite you. Chances are, you won't love and enjoy every indulgence equally so rank the ones that stand out as 110 percent worth it and skip the rest. If a cocktail makes the cut, connect with the festive feelings and love every sip!\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Didi Martinez", "title": "Facebook ads ask company employees to 'anonymously' leak information", "description": "Freedom from Facebook's campaign comes less than a week after the coalition submitted a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission asking them to consider fining and breaking up the company.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-ads-ask-company-employees-anonymously-leak-information-n938881", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2654496/181121-facebook-logo-cs-1022a_dd3dc732bd13863d6bd4ed9f9fc3055d.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:15:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Tulsi Gabbard on Wednesday slammed President Donald Trump as \"Saudi Arabia's bitch\" in the latest scathing criticism of the commander-in-chief's extraordinary statement this week to stand by the country's rulers despite the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe Hawaii Democratic congresswoman made the remarks in a brief and blistering tweet Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Hey @realdonaldtrump: being Saudi Arabia's bitch is not 'America First,'\" wrote Gabbard, a 37-year-old Iraq War veteran who at various points has been considered a rising star in her party.\n\nThe tweet was in apparent reference to Trump's exclamation point-filled formal presidential statement Tuesday that his administration would take no actions against Saudi Arabia's rulers regarding the Khashoggi killing \u2014 despite NBC News and other reports last week that the CIA concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's killing.\n\n\"It could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Trump said in the statement, which featured a subheading that read \"America First!\" In the statement, he also outlined how the U.S. needed Saudi support to help fight terrorism internationally and to help keep oil prices low.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, he followed the statement with a tweet about oil, saying that it was \"Great!\" that \u201cprices getting lower\u201d\n\n\"Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let\u2019s go lower!\" he wrote, hours before Gabbard chimed in.\n\nThe white-hot words from Gabbard mark a departure from an earlier apparent attempt to work with him. In November 2016, just weeks after Trump won the election, Gabbard met with the president-elect at Trump Tower to discuss the war in Syria and other foreign policy issues. Gabbard called the meeting \"frank and positive,\" and there was speculation at the time that she was being considered for a job in his administration.\n\nPreviously, Gabbard had clashed with President Barack Obama and other top Democrats, especially on foreign policy and Syria (during Obama's second term she appeared on Fox News to lambaste the administration for refusing to use the term \u201cIslamic extremism\"). And in January 2017, she revealed that she'd traveled to the war-torn country, without the knowledge of her party's leaders, to meet with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nTrump's statement about Khashoggi, and broader decision to side with Saudi Arabia over his own intelligence agencies, prompted furious criticism from both sides of the aisle.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Tuesday tweeted, \"I'm pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia First, not America First.\"\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., tweeted Tuesday night, \"I never thought I'd see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Why it may be harder to find the perfect Christmas tree", "description": "A tight supply means some shoppers will be paying more and searching longer for that perfect Christmas tree this holiday season, industry experts say.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/why-it-may-be-harder-find-perfect-christmas-tree-n938966", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2654671/181121-christmas-trees-concord-mass-ew-1132a_e93f5714e29e6236834b692467d8f986.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:33:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nMONTPELIER, Vt. \u2014 People may need to trim back their Christmas tree expectations this year.\n\nA tight supply means some shoppers will be paying more and searching longer for that perfect Christmas tree this holiday season. But there's no need for panic buying on Black Friday as industry experts say consumers will end up with something to decorate this holiday season.\n\nThe yuletide market imbalance was created a decade ago when a glut of Christmas trees and the Great Recession combined to drive many growers out of business. Now the supply is tight and it takes eight to 10 years \u2014 the time needed to grow a Christmas tree \u2014 to boost the supply.\n\n\"It's bad. It's the worst I've seen in a long time,\" said Matthew LaCasce, co-owner of the Finestkind Christmas tree farm in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine. The farm sells about 10,000 trees each season and is turning down orders every day from desperate retailers, LaCasce said.\n\nLarger retailers are doing just fine, officials say. It's the smaller charitable organizations, school groups, and mom-and-pop operators that have had to scramble for trees.\n\nIn Hawaii, Christmas tree seller Richard Tajiri said he ended up 1,000 trees short this season.\n\n\"It's going to be tough for everybody. There's nothing you can do about it,\" said Tajiri, who is fielding several dozen calls a day in Honolulu. \"It's first come, first served.\"\n\nLovell's Florist and Nursery in Medford, Massachusetts, resorted to a hodgepodge of suppliers from Canada, North Carolina and the West Coast because the regular wholesaler couldn't deliver, owner LaVerne Lovell said. They were expecting their final 1,000 trees to be delivered Friday.\n\n\"It was about two days of complete panic,\" she recalled. \"The Christmas season carries us through the winter. If we don't have any trees, it would've been a real nightmare.\"\n\nThe American Legion in Dover, Massachusetts, also had to search high and low for 450 trees for its annual fundraiser. \"It's getting tough,\" said Tom McGill, who oversees the effort.\n\nSupply and demand problems are nothing new. Like other crops, Christmas trees are a commodity that goes through cycles from too few trees to an oversupply.\n\nIt's bad. It's the worst I've seen in a long time.\"\n\nBut regional factors are also exacerbating the problem.\n\nFor example, a spring frost damaged trees at some farms in Canada's Nova Scotia, choking off some supply in the Northeast. Some Canadian farms in New Brunswick are buried under snow from recent storms, making it difficult for them to get trees onto trucks for shipment.\n\nA shortage of Fraser trees, the most popular on the East Coast, had some North Carolina buyers scrambling to find balsam firs in New England. In Oregon, some people are taking Fraser fir trees from the East instead of noble firs that are the most popular tree on the West Coast.\n\n\"Supply and demand seem to always be in some flux,\" Chal Landgren, a Christmas tree specialist and professor at Oregon State University, said via email.\n\nAll told, U.S. consumers are expected to buy about 27 million trees, roughly the same as the last two years, according to the National Christmas Tree Association.\n\nMost people will find what they want, but prices could be a bit higher than last year's average retail price of about $75, said Tim O'Connor, the association's director.\n\nWith the lean supply, shoppers might want to start early if they want a lot of choice and variety.\n\nSpencer Putman, of Weybridge, Vermont, didn't worry himself about a purchase. He simply paid $5 for a permit to chop down his own tree in the 400,000-acre Green Mountain National Forest. \"I don't think we are going to run out of them very soon,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Tom Metcalfe", "title": "Huge, high-flying 'pseudo-satellite' will soon take to the skies", "description": "The Odysseus, a huge solar-powered airplane, developed by Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences, will soon be taking to the skies.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/huge-high-flying-pseudo-satellite-will-soon-take-skies-ncna938946", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2653516/181120-auora-odysseus-aerial-vehicle-cs-342p_78316ccbb174cb07e5dac6ccfd0d0b58.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:31:22Z", "content": "SUBSCRIBE Nov. 21, 2018 / 5:31 PM GMT More than an ordinary aerial drone but not quite a satellite, a huge solar-powered airplane with three tails and wings wider than a jumbo jets will soon be taking to the skies.

It has a 243-foot wingspan but weighs less than a small car, the company says. Its six electrically powered propellers will be driven by energy from hundreds of solar panels that cover the aircraft's exterior or from banks of rechargeable batteries on board, depending on the available sunlight.\n\nWith a top speed of 100 miles an hour, Odysseus won't be very fast. But it's designed to soar to altitudes above 60,000 feet and stay aloft for months at a time.\n\nThe aircraft is the centerpiece of Boeing\u2019s plan to join the growing market for high-altitude pseudo-satellite (HAPS) service, a less costly alternative to satellite missions for organizations that need a high-altitude platform for tasks including environmental monitoring, atmospheric research and military surveillance.\n\nAurora\u2019s chief executive, John Langford, said three prototype Odysseus aircraft were being built for test flights that would start in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico next spring. The company hopes to start renting out space on Aurora aircraft in several years, once the aircraft are fully developed and tested.\n\nThe first two prototypes will be used to test the drone\u2019s airworthiness and its solar power \u2014 especially during short winter days when sunlight is limited. The third prototype, due to launch in 2020, will carry experimental gear designed by Harvard scientists to conduct research on the ozone layer, and will help test Aurora\u2019s payload capacity.\n\nLangford said the craft\u2019s unusual design would allow it to carry payloads of up to 100 pounds. That\u2019s significantly more than the typical customer payload of 15 pounds carried by another HAPS contender, the Airbus Zephyr drone that set new altitude and endurance records for unpiloted flight earlier this year. Some high-altitude drone designs offer only a few pounds of payload capacity.\n\n\u201cCustomers always want more payload \u2014 that\u2019s just a truism in the airplane business,\u201d Langford said, adding that to get 50 or 100 pounds of useful payload \u201crequires a pretty large airplane, given today\u2019s technology \u2014 and that\u2019s what drives the Odysseus\u2019s size.\u201d\n\nSiddharth Shihora, an analyst at the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based space industry consulting firm Northern Sky Research, told NBC News MACH in an email that high-flying drones like Odysseus could be especially useful for military applications. For commercial clients, he said, competing balloon-based HAPS platforms might be stronger contenders.\n\nBalloon-based HAPS platforms include Project Loon, developed by Alphabet (formerly Google), and the Stratobus airships developed by the French aerospace company Thales.\n\nThough balloon-based platforms may not be as easy to control or as versatile as high-altitude drones, they have the potential to carry larger payloads \u2014 more than 500 pounds in the case of the Thales design.\n\nWant more stories about futuristic aircraft?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Daniella Silva", "title": "Amazon exposes some customer names, emails in technical error", "description": "The company did not elaborate on the exact nature of the error, but said the issue had been fixed and that the incident was not a breach of its website or any of its systems.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amazon-exposes-some-customer-names-emails-technical-error-n938971", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_38/2296741/180118-amazon-mn-1035_75f03f5a617cdb4520415f1cadbae698.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:11:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The coldest Turkey Day in Boston was 19 degrees, in 1873. Philadelphia's coldest Thanksgiving was 28 degrees, in 1901.\n\nNew York City is also bracing for winds of 15 mph to 25 mph on Thursday, which had Macy's parade organizers on high alert Wednesday. The parade will go on, but whether the 16 giant balloons will fly is another question.\n\nAny sustained winds of 23 mph or gusts of 34 mph would ground the massive inflatable stars, organizers said. They'll decide Thursday morning whether the balloons will be in action.\n\nThe Rockettes rehearse Tuesday night for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

In 1997, 43-mph winds blew a 6-foot-tall Cat in the Hat balloon straight into a lamppost, severing a metal arm that struck two people in the head \u2014 one of whom was left in a coma for 23 days.\n\nThe last time high winds grounded the balloons was in 1971. The parade, which is televised by NBC, starts at 9 a.m. ET.\n\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh said he's worried that his residents will look at the calendar and not understand just how cold it'll be on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm a little concerned about it, because I don't think people realize. ... It's Thanksgiving, so everyone knows it's going to be cold, but no one realizes it's going to be that cold,\" Walsh told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"We kind of think of the weather we're getting tomorrow more [is] like January weather than November weather.\"\n\nWalsh was particularly worried about people going to high school football games \u2014 a Thanksgiving tradition throughout much of New England \u2014 without being properly dressed.\n\n\"So we're asking people if you go to a football game, dress appropriately.

Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2014 whose district sits not far from the flames \u2014 took this historic opportunity to propose a bold solution: reviving a toothless, decade-old committee to, as the New York Times reported, \u201ceducate the public about the impact of more frequent extreme weather events.\u201d\n\nDo Californians need a committee for that? Several dozen millennials from the groups Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats don't think so. On November 13, they crowded into Pelosi\u2019s office for a sit-in and to ask the aspiring speaker of the House, \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d\n\nDemonstrators and incoming Democratic Congress members Rashida Tlaib, Deb Haaland, Ro Khanna and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 who joined protesters in Pelosi\u2019s chambers \u2014 are calling for something else: a Green New Deal. More specifically, they want to create a committee tasked with finding a way to transition America off of fossil fuels over the next 10 years and empowered with the authority to set that plan into motion with legislation. Politicians who accept campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry would be barred from participating.\n\nWhat would such a Green New Deal actually entail, and why should Democrats back it \u2014 aside from the fact that the alternative could condemn hundreds of millions of people to death?\n\nIronically, while it was Pelosi who called for the Democratic House to embrace a \u201cbipartisan marketplace of ideas\u201d after election day, those pushing her on the climate may have a better plan for reaching across the aisle. After all, Green New Deal-style policies enjoy majority support in states ranging from deep blue to dark red.\n\nSo what would such a Green New Deal actually entail, and why should Democrats back it \u2014 aside from the fact that the alternative could condemn hundreds of millions of people to death?\n\nFor one, it\u2019s the only proposal on the table in line with the scientific reality of climate change. President Donald Trump and a majority of the GOP Congresspeople deny that significant climate change policies are needed. But besides paying lip service to the science and standing by the Paris Agreement, even the Democratic Party has largely not pushed for the sweeping changes scientists say are needed: cutting emissions by around half by 2030 and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the absolute latest. Getting there, says the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), will require \u201cunprecedented transitions in all aspects of society\u201d and what other scientists have likened in scale to the U.S. mobilization around World War II. About four-fifths of all known coal reserves, a third of oil reserves and half of gas reserves will have to be kept underground, unburned and out of energy markets.\n\nLike the first New Deal, then, the Green New Deal isn\u2019t a specific set of policies so much as a values framework under which any number of policies can fit. Electrifying everything, constraining the power of the world\u2019s most powerful industry and preparing for what will almost certainly be the largest mass migration in human history don\u2019t slot neatly into a single Medicare for All-style policy or slogan. On the other hand, neither did clawing our way out of the Great Depression. After 40 years of neoliberal economics espousing the idea that, per Margaret Thatcher, there is \u201cno such thing as society,\u201d the Green New Deal asserts the now apparently radical idea that the government has a responsibility to provide society with a decent quality of life, including a planet that isn\u2019t actively hostile to human life.\n\nSmartly, calls for a Green New Deal help tie solutions to the climate crisis to the promise of a stronger and more equitable economy, upending the false \"jobs versus environment\" dichotomy that conservatives and the fossil fuel industry have worked so hard to cultivate. Thanks to their success on that front, climate change has been framed as an issue of collective sacrifice, requiring all of us to give up everything from plastic straws to jobs to hamburgers. Even favored Democratic proposals like cap-and-trade and carbon taxes feed the notion that everyone will have to pay up. (This narrative was exploited successfully in November in Washington state, where the oil and gas industry spent some $30 million to defeat what would have been the country\u2019s first statewide carbon pricing mechanism.)\n\nCalls for a Green New Deal help tie solutions to the climate crisis to the promise of a stronger and more equitable economy, upending the false jobs-vs.-environment dichotomy.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry loves the idea that all of us are to blame for our warming planet, because it allows them to rhetorically align themselves with everyman oil workers and against jet-setting billionaires like Tom Steyer or Michael Bloomberg. In the process, they shift both the conversation and the responsibility away from the 100 fossil fuel producers that have been responsible for 71 percent of greenhouse gas emissions since 1988.\n\nThe really inconvenient truth about climate change \u2014 the thing that could build popular momentum around doing something about it, at the expense of fossil fuel industry profits \u2014 is that the solutions for it stand to dramatically improve the lives of millions of people, especially compared to the collective but unequally distributed ruin we face otherwise. A job guarantee \u2014 a centerpiece of several Green New Deal proposals endorsed by politicians from New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 could end involuntary unemployment as we know it, providing a well-paid job to everyone who needs one.\n\nNew York could finally fix the MTA, as cities around the country get robust public transit networks and beautiful, no-carbon public housing of the sort found in locales from Vienna to Chile. And from Appalachia to Alaska, communities whose livelihoods have been bound up in fossil fuels could receive the investments needed to diversify their economies, as coal miners and rig operators are re-trained by their unions to help build the clean-energy future.\n\nSpain recently helped show what this future could look like. The country\u2019s new social democratic government plans to shutter its last coal mines by year\u2019s end. With the support of Spanish trade unions, they\u2019ll also invest the relatively small sum of $282 million to put the country\u2019s already-shrinking fleet of coal workers to work restoring former mines and learning new skills in the renewables sector.\n\nLest this transition be all about work, though, refocusing the economy around producing more of what we need \u2014 renewable power, care work, education \u2014 and less of what we don\u2019t \u2014 fossil fuels and cheap junk \u2014 also could shorten America\u2019s outrageously inflated work week.\n\nFor these and other reasons, a Green New Deal would be wildly popular. Polling from the upstart progressive think tank Data for Progress suggests that a majority of Americans in every state support calls for a federal job guarantee, even more so if those jobs help push us toward a low-carbon future. Newer polling has also found that 66 percent of Americans overall support a green jobs program, and that only 12 percent would oppose such a plan. Support is stronger still among people under 45, who are on the cusp of becoming the country\u2019s largest voting bloc.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to imagine Democrats pushing even popular legislation through while Republicans control the Senate and the White House, they can still put the ruling party in a tough spot as the 2020 election looms. A national debate over a Green New Deal would force the GOP to openly side with their fossil fuel executive donors instead of the American public, and argue against what could potentially become the biggest job creation program in American history. If the GOP is willing to spend $3.8 trillion on tax cuts for the wealthy, why won\u2019t it invest even a fraction of that sum providing a dignified quality of life for the country\u2019s less than 80,000 remaining coal workers as their mines continue closing? Whether they believe in climate change or not, it would be hard for lawmakers to justify rejecting a plan to lift millions of Americans out of poverty and bring the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure fully into the 21st century. Why hold the future of today\u2019s children hostage for the profits of a few multinational corporations?\n\n\u201cLittle groups of earnest men and women have told us of this havoc... the evils that we have brought upon ourselves today and the even greater evils that will attend our children unless we act,\u201d President Franklin Delano Roosevelt told Congress in 1935, requesting $4 billion for public works projects. \u201cSuch is the condition that attends the exploitation of our natural resources if we continue our planless course.\u201d\n\nEight decades later, the Democratic Party\u2019s Congressional leadership can listen to today\u2019s little earnest groups and commit to planning for a Green New Deal. Or they can join Republicans on their planless course toward even greater evils."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Consider the wishbone: From dinosaur holdover to Thanksgiving leftover", "description": "Breaking the wishbone is a holiday tradition that goes all the way back to the late-Jurassic.

It is the largest dowry ever paid in the civil war-torn country, the government said.\n\nThe highest bidder was a man three times the 17-year-old's age. At least four other men in Eastern Lakes state competed, said Philips Anyang Ngong, a human rights lawyer who tried to stop the bidding last month. Among the bidders was the state's deputy governor.\n\n\"She has been reduced to a mere commodity,\" Ngong told The Associated Press, calling it \"the biggest test of child abuse, trafficking and auctioning of a human being.\" Everyone involved should be held accountable, he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Nyalong became the man's ninth wife. Photos posted on Facebook show her sitting beside the groom, wearing a lavish dress and staring despondently at the floor. The AP is using only her first name to protect her identity.\n\nSouth Sudan has a deeply rooted cultural practice of paying dowries for brides, usually in the form of cows. It also has a long history of child marriage. Even though that practice is now illegal, 40 percent of girls still marry before age 18, according to the United Nations Population Fund. The practice \"threatens girls' lives\" and limits prospects for their future, said Dr. Mary Otieno, the agency's country representative.\n\nThe bidding war has caused local and international outrage. It took several days for Facebook to remove the post that first pointed out the auction, and after it was taken down other posts \"glorifying\" the situation remained, George Otim, country director for Plan International South Sudan, told the AP.\n\n\"This barbaric use of technology is reminiscent of latter-day slave markets. That a girl could be sold for marriage on the world's biggest social networking site in this day and age is beyond belief,\" he said. The auction was discussed, not carried out, on the site.\n\nFacebook did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nWhile South Sudan's government condemns the practice of child marriage it says it can't regulate communities' cultural norms, especially in remote areas.\n\n\"You can't call it bidding as if it was an auction. It's not bidding. If you see it with European eyes you'll call it an auction,\" government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told the AP. \"You have to see it with an African eye, as it's a tradition that goes back thousands of years. There's no word for it in English.\"\n\nSome local lawmakers and activists disagree. In a statement released this week, the National Alliance for Women Lawyers in South Sudan called upon officials to comply with the government's plan to end child marriage by 2030. Ending the practice includes putting a stop to the auctioning of girls.\n\nSouth Sudan's anti-human trafficking chief called the case reminiscent of others he has seen across the country, in which girls are forced or tricked into marriage after being told they are going to live with relatives and go to school instead.\n\n\"It is clear that some human trafficking practices are hidden in our culture,\" John Mading said.\n\nIn other cases, some girls who grow up in the South Sudanese diaspora are brought back to the country and forced to marry. The AP spoke with several people who know girls who arrived for what they thought was a vacation, only to have their passports taken away and forced into marriage by their families.\n\n\"Some families want children to marry in their countries and in their ethnic communities, but most do it if the kids are misbehaving,\" said Esther Ikere Eluzai, undersecretary for South Sudan's ministry of gender."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Minyvonne Burke", "title": "Brother of man found dead outside his burning New Jersey home charged with arson in separate house fire", "description": "Paul Caneiro was charged Wednesday morning for setting his Ocean Township home on fire, the prosecutor's office said.

Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are incredible actors \u2014 and they could make fine wine out of Pruno \u2014 so once they both began to loosen up and like each other, I started to like them, and to believe in their on-screen friendship. However, there are movies that appeal to one\u2019s better angels, and then there\u2019s ones that pander, and I got sucked in because of the latter \u2014 not because of some inherent maliciousness in the pandering, but because of my own thoughtlessness, laziness and socialization.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone who made \u201cGreen Book\u201d consciously set out on a mission to make white people feel smug and self-congratulatory about race relations, but that\u2019s the end result of watching it. There are plenty of people who are not hateful, racist or willfully ignorant who will enjoy \u201cGreen Book\u201d; I am very sure that I know and love a whole lot of people who will enjoy \u201cGreen Book.\" (I\u2019d wager that the white people who go see \u201cGreen Book\u201d think of themselves as socially open-minded people who like seeing other white folks overcome their prejudices and become friends. Which is, in fact, good!)\n\nBut this movie was written, directed and produced by white people for white people, almost none of whom will have never found themselves at risk of a hate crime, much less a hate crime neatly solved by a tough white guy who, in one scene, eats an entire pizza folded up like a slice while relaxing in his undershirt and shorts.\n\nIn Peter Farrelly\u2019s dramedy, based on the true story of Dr. Don Shirley\u2019s friendship with Tony Lip, Ali stars as Shirley, the legendary composer and pianist who embarked on a two-month tour of the South with his musical trio in the 1960s. Lip, played by Mortensen, is a working-class guy from the Bronx who\u2019s hired by Shirley to drive him from New York City and back by Christmas.\n\nLip isn\u2019t sure why Shirley picked him from all the other candidates, and he\u2019s not thrilled at the prospect of working for a black man \u2014 even an extraordinarily talented, educated and well-off black man \u2014 but he\u2019s also not too racist to take the musician\u2019s money.\n\nIt\u2019s immediately obvious to the audience why Lip was hired: The former Frank Vallelonga (that\u2019s right, the actor who played Carmine Lupertazzi on \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d) is great at smooth-talking dangerous people \u2014 like the mobsters who run the Copacabana \u2014 but he\u2019s even better at fighting (and eating).\n\nAnd thus, every time Shirley finds himself in dangerous and violent situations, Lip steps in to save him \u2014 and not just from the racist townies or the racist policemen or the racist rich people, but from himself, because he refuses to bow to the racist conventions of the times. His refusal to accept those conventions, and not the racists upholding them, is what endangers Shirley over and over again (and strikes awe in the hearts of the white people around him), and is the reason Lip\u2019s services are perceived as needed.\n\nHere it\u2019s worth noting that the script was co-written by Tony\u2019s son Nick Vallelonga, who is also listed as a producer on the film, and I feel extremely bad for talking smack about what is obviously meant to be a tribute to his father and the power of interracial friendships as they were seen in the 60s. But movies that frame race in this way do a disservice to audiences, Vallelonga and Shirley.\n\nThe title refers to \u201cThe Negro Motorist Green Book,\u201d a historical text I\u2019m embarrassed to admit I\u2019d never heard about before. It was written by a postal employee from Harlem named Victor H. Green, who wanted to provide a guide to safe havens for people of color during road trips, from bathrooms and gas stations to bathrooms, restaurants and hotels. As per the Washington Post, one ad in the book read, \u201cIf you\u2019re traveling you don\u2019t have to worry about accommodations \u2014 whether this place will take you in or that place will sell you food. That is if you\u2019re white and gentile. If you\u2019re not, you have to travel a careful route like seeking oases in a desert.\u201d\n\nThe ugly reality of why the \u201cGreen Book\u201d exists becomes all too clear to Lip the farther south they get, because he\u2019s apparently only used to the slightly-less-overt racism he sees in New York. After all, he and the men in his family speak among themselves in Italian when they\u2019re being racist.\n\nThere\u2019s almost a nugget of something interesting at the portrayal of the intersection of the Italian-American identity, the working class and education that could be vital, but it\u2019s handled with about as much subtlety as you\u2019d expect from the director of \u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary.\u201d (It feels like a cheap shot to mention Farrelly\u2019s other movies, but it\u2019s not.) Unfortunately for Mortensen, his character isn\u2019t really salvageable, and Lip as written leaves a Fonzie-like aftertaste in your mouth if, in between \u201cAYYYY\u201ds, Fonzie had also said things about how, as an Italian-American, many people saw him as socially/racially \u201cworse\u201d than a black man like Shirley. (Lip uses slightly different language that I won\u2019t repeat here, but maybe I\u2019m just more uptight than Mortensen.)\n\nShirley, for his part, keeps trying to teach Lip how to speak more eloquently, to stop stealing and to use his words instead of his fists, but the only thing Lip seems to learn is how to sweet-talk his wife (played by the woefully underused Linda Cardellini, who is one of the very few women in the movie to have more than a handful of lines) and to stop punching people without first trying to reason with them. Meanwhile, he teaches Shirley all about self-acceptance, the joys of eating fried chicken and Motown.\n\nOnce I shook off the glossy trappings of \u201cGreen Book\u201d and its on-the-nose ending, I couldn\u2019t still enjoy the friendship brought to life on the screen. It can sometimes be enough to just enjoy a movie and go on about your day, but if \u201cGreen Book\u201d wants to be taken seriously as a film against racism \u2014 which it has positioned itself to be \u2014 it has to confront the lived reality of racism and the people it most directly affected (and still affects) in a deeply honest way. And when those people aren\u2019t the ones who will leave \u201cGreen Book\u201d feeling good, then it clearly hasn\u2019t accomplished its objectives."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Patricia Guadalupe", "title": "Turkey and mole sauce?

The Washington-based chef and restaurateur, who hails from Puerto Rico, likes to add his special touches to the quintessential American tradition.\n\n\u201cI do all kinds of different things, such as a five-chili rub on the turkey, or a pavoch\u00f3n, which is a turkey seasoned like a roast pork (the word is a combination of pavo, which is turkey, and lech\u00f3n, which is roast pork) and stuffed with mofongo (a dish of mashed plantains, garlic, and pork rinds),\"said the chef.\n\nSometimes he looks to Spain for inspiration and stuffs his turkey with paella, and his side dishes include arroz con pernil (rice with pork).\n\n\"Thanksgiving is American, but the Latin influence is everywhere on the table.\" said Iguina. \"And just look at the new chefs and the new restaurants opening all around the country. So many of them have that Latino influence.\u201d\n\nThere are now about 57 million Hispanics who call the United States their home. And whether families have been here for centuries or are more recent immigrants, culinary traditions from Latin America and the Caribbean are soaked up at the Thanksgiving table.\n\nCalifornia-based Rosa Montes Vaca remembers the time when her uncle came to visit from Mexico during the Thanksgiving holiday. Her mother had cooked a turkey with all the trimmings and usual side dishes, such as mashed potatoes.\n\n\u201cHe was seated with us and we said a blessing and began to eat, but he sat motionless with a disturbed look on his face. We're all like, 'Qu\u00e9 pas\u00f3 T\u00edo Abel? (What\u2019s going on, Uncle Abel?) and he said to my mother, 'D\u00f3nde est\u00e1n las tortillas?' (Where are the tortillas?) And my mother said that doesn\u2019t go with this kind of food. But he wouldn\u2019t budge,\" she said.\n\nMontes Vaca said she got up, heated some corn tortillas and gave them to her uncle. \"He put his mashed potatoes with gravy in the tortilla and ate happily,\" she said, recalling his big smile.\n\nCynthia Orosco Wright, from Michigan, chuckles when she thinks about her Mexican-American family's Thanksgiving table.\n\n\u201cWe made tacos out of everything, even mashed potatoes, and we had the tamales. Some kids would wonder what we were eating for Thanksgiving,\" she said. \"But it was totally normal for us. It never felt out of place to have our own kind of food at Thanksgiving, because that's what you do.\"\n\nThat, and staying up late with her cousins, was her favorite part of the holiday.\n\nVenezuela native Dubraska Vale loves the all-American holiday, which she has happily embraced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to give thanks; too many times we worry about the little things,\" said the Washington, D.C.-based public relations executive.\n\n\"For some of us, our family is not our relatives, because they are far away, so we have a family of people that we love and [they]care about us,\u201d said Vale.\n\nVale said she is \u201cgoing all out\u201d with traditional Venezuelan holiday dishes for this Thanksgiving. She'll be having hallacas, which are similar to Mexican tamales, as well as pan de jam\u00f3n (a rolled bread with olives and ham), and ensalada de gallina (chicken salad).\n\n\u201cThese are usually Christmas dishes in Venezuela, but I\u2019m making them now in Thanksgiving because Thanksgiving is not observed in Venezuela. But this is the celebration of living here in the United States and being grateful for what we have,\u201d she told NBC News.\n\nMexico native Fabiola Rodr\u00edguez Ciampoli's first Thanksgiving in the U.S. was not the best, but that has changed over the years.\n\n\u201cMy first Thanksgiving was as a grad student here in the United States celebrating with a bunch of strangers, so it wasn\u2019t that great. I had gone to a bilingual immersion school in Mexico City so I knew about the holiday and the traditions, even though we didn\u2019t celebrate it in Mexico,\" she recalled.\n\n\"But now (married and with a young son) my in-laws go all out and it\u2019s great, and what I love about it is that it\u2019s about family and food, and that\u2019s so Latino,\" Rodriguez Campioli said.\n\nCalifornian Claudia Mel\u00e9ndez Salinas adds a Mexican touch to her Thanksgiving; her signature side dish is homemade tamales with mole sauce (made of chocolate and spices) from her native Puebla, Mexico.\n\n\u201cSometimes I have a hard time with this holiday, because I know what happened to the Native Americans and how they were displaced,\" she said. \"But I can also relate to being thankful and grateful, and to gather together,\" she said.\n\nItaly native and chef Christian Darcoli embraced Hispanic culture and food when he married a Latina.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving is an American tradition but we add our own touches, and for me that includes a lot of rice dishes from Puerto Rico, such as arroz con gandules (rice and pigeon peas, with pork and spices).\n\nMelisa D\u00edaz, a media and political consultant in the nation\u2019s capital, loves to cook and bring dishes from her native Puerto Rico to the Thanksgiving table. Since the island is part of the U.S., Puerto Ricans celebrate Thanksgiving.\n\n\"We embrace the tradition but also give it our own touch,\" said Diaz. \"It\u2019s a nice and delicious way to link both places and come together.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Lisa Riordan Seville", "title": "Angry Michigan judge orders Iraqi detainees released, blasts government", "description": "\"From the earliest stages of this case, the Government made demonstrably false statements to the Court designed to delay the proceedings,\" wrote the judge.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/angry-judge-michigan-orders-iraqi-detainees-released-blasts-government-n938731", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2654476/181121-hamama-family-aclu-cs-1008a_77014cff7ac71aaf45d862dff04bccd0.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:16:48Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Lisa Riordan Seville\n\nA federal judge in Michigan ordered the release of about 100 Iraqi detainees Tuesday, blasting the government for submitting false statements and saying he plans to issue sanctions.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith said delays by the government in responding to court orders and producing documents in response to a class action lawsuit had \"shattered\" the families of detained Iraqis facing deportation.\n\n\"From the earliest stages of this case,\" he wrote, \"the Government made demonstrably false statements to the Court designed to delay the proceedings.\"\n\nThe ruling is the latest in a series of judicial rebukes to the Trump administration's immigration policies, including this week's battle over the administration's new asylum policy.\n\nNahrain Hamama and her four children in their church near Detroit, Michigan. Nehrain's husband Usama \"Sam\" Hamama was detained by ICE along with approximately 100 other Chaldean Christians from Michigan in June 2017. Sam, who came to the U.S. as a child, was being deported for a decades-old criminal conviction. His family worried he could be persecuted for his faith if returned to Iraq. Rachel Woolf / ACLU\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, which represents the Iraqis, has claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement lied to the court in order to keep the Iraqis in custody.\n\n\"Today's decision is about accountability,\" said ACLU senior staff attorney Miriam Aukerman. \"Judge Goldsmith made it clear that ICE is not above the law.\"\n\nThe ACLU filed the suit in 2017 on behalf of about 1,400 Iraqis facing deportation. Most had either overstayed a visa or have a criminal conviction, some of which date back to the 1980s.\n\nIraq has historically refused to take back deportees from the U.S. who did not voluntarily agree to return. In early 2017, that policy shifted. Iraq accepted a small charter flight of Iraqis who were already in custody as deportees in exchange for being removed from President Trump's first \"travel ban.\"\n\nPreparing for further deportations, ICE then arrested about 200 more Iraqis, at least half of them in Michigan, many of them Chaldean Christians, a group that had strongly supported President Trump's election. But thousands of pages of government documents released last month indicated that the two countries did not have a clear pledge that Iraq would continue to cooperate.\n\nAstevana Shaya, 28, of Sterling Heights, Mich., wears a Chaldeans Lives Matter T-shirt at a protest on June 12, 2017 in Sterling Heights, Michigan. The arrests of dozens of Iraqi Christians in southeastern Michigan by U.S. immigration officials appear to be among the first roundups of people from Iraq who have long faced deportation, underscoring rising concerns in other immigrant communities. Todd McInturf / Detroit News via AP file\n\nThat put the Iraqis in custody at risk of remaining detained indefinitely, the ACLU claimed, a violation of a 2001 Supreme Court decision. Attorneys for the Iraqis argued that unless the government could show they would be deported imminently, ICE should free the remaining detainees, some of whom have been locked up for nearly 18 months.\n\nThe government has maintained in court filings that Iraq is willing to play ball. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.\n\nIn his strongly-worded opinion Tuesday, Judge Goldsmith sided with the Iraqis. Any detainee who has been in custody more than six months must be freed within the next 30 days, unless the government can make a case for why an individual should remain detained. Even if released, they still face potential deportation.\n\nGoldsmith also admonished the federal government, saying that sanctions were likely forthcoming.\n\n\"[T]he Government has acted ignobly in this case, by failing to comply with court orders, submitting demonstrably false declarations of Government officials, and otherwise violating its litigation obligations\u2014all of which impels this Court to impose sanctions,\" Goldsmith wrote.\n\nHe pointed specifically to the toll detention has taken on families.\n\n\"Detention has inflicted grave harm on numerous detainees for which there is no remedy at law,\" he wrote. \"Families have been shattered.\"\n\nThe ruling marks a victory not only for the Iraqis, but also for the integrity of the courts, said Kim Scott, a principal at Miller Canfield Paddock and Stone, which brought the case with the ACLU.\n\n\"The judicial system is premised on both sides putting their cards on the table,\" she said. \"The government has been hiding the ball.\"\n\nBut, Scott added, it won't give her clients back the time that has passed.\n\n\"It's taken 18 months to get here,\" she said. \"It's devastating.

What\u2019s more, the FBI data does not list a single hate crime murder in the state of Kansas for 2017.\n\n\u201cHate crimes are not being accurately reported,\u201d said Sim J. Singh, senior manager of policy and advocacy at The Sikh Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cThat\u2019s what our organization has consistently been saying.\u201d\n\nWhile many expressed alarm over the more than 17 percent increase in hate crimes across America, there were also concerns about reporting procedures used to tally the data, which some say have exacerbated an undercount of hate crimes.\n\nOne of the chief culprits, they argue, is that local law enforcement agencies are not required to provide hate crime data to the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program.\n\nWhile the hate crime report for 2017 included participants from 16,149 law enforcement agencies, only around 13 percent of them (2,040) reported one or more incidents.\n\nThe rest reported no hate crimes.\n\n\u201cBecause there is no mandate, there\u2019s not always the incentive to provide the data,\u201d said Lakshmi Sridaran, director of national policy and advocacy at South Asian Americans Leading Together, a national nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cI think a lot of localities see that as a mark or a stain on their reputation if they have a hate crime in their jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear why the fatal shooting of Kuchibhotla in Olathe, Kansas, did not appear to make it into the report.\n\n\u201cWe accurately sent our statistics to the state as per protocol, and they forwarded them to the FBI,\u201d said Sgt. Logan Bonney, a spokesman for the Olathe Police Department. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the FBI does not have them.\u201d\n\nBonney provided a link to the Olathe city website with the department\u2019s hate/bias crime statistics from 2015 to 2017. The data show there were six such incidents in 2017, including one listed as anti-other ethnicity/national origin.\n\nBonney referred further comment to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.\n\nA spokesperson for the KBI said by email that the FBI did not count the Olathe killing due to differences in the way information about hate crime incidents are reported from some local law enforcement to some states and then from those states to the FBI.\n\nThe KBI is in the process of a major upgrade to its reporting system that would fix the problem in the future, the spokesperson added, and other states are going through similar upgrades.\n\nAn FBI spokesperson forwarded an NBC News emailed request for comment to its crime statistics management unit, which did not immediately respond.\n\nExactly just how many hate crimes in 2017 were excluded in the recently released report was not immediately known. The Arab American Institute, a national nonprofit advocacy group, mentioned two others besides the Olathe shooting in a news release after the FBI report was made public.\n\nFBI data showed that the number of victims of anti-Asian bias increased by around 20 percent, from 137 in 2016 to 165 in 2017. The number of victims of bias against Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders, meanwhile, doubled from nine in 2016 to 18 in 2017.\n\nWhile the figures showed a drop in the number of victims of anti-Muslim bias, from 388 in 2016 to 325 in 2017, the group still accounted for 18.6 percent of anti-religious hate crime victims.\n\nAs for victims of anti-Sikh bias, that number more than tripled, from eight in 2016 to 26 in 2017.\n\n\u201cSikhs have a very visible identity,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThe majority of people in the United States who wear a turban are Sikhs, and they\u2019re often going to be the ones that are going to be targeted by someone who has a bad intent against someone who may appear foreign or who may appear not American.\u201d\n\nSingh said he thinks the FBI report is way off the mark when it comes to capturing the extent to which Sikhs are victims of hate crimes. A lack of training and accountability within law enforcement to report these kinds of incidents is one of the reasons for this, according to Singh.\n\n\u201cAnother issue is that the perpetrator bias is what is recorded,\u201d Singh added. \u201cSo if the perpetrator believes that I\u2019m Muslim and he\u2019s attacking a Sikh in that hate crime, that\u2019s not going to be flagged as an anti-Sikh hate crime if the perpetrator is providing anti-Muslim bias statements during that attack.\u201d\n\nDilpreet Kaleka, left, and Simran Kaleka cry during a candlelight vigil outside of the Oak Creek Community Center in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, on Aug. 7, 2012. Chris Wilson / AP\n\nOverall, the latest FBI report showed there were 7,175 bias crimes, which targeted 8,493 victims based on their race and sexual orientation, reported in 2017.\n\nThere had been 6,121 hate crimes reported in 2016, 5,850 such offenses in 2015 and 5,479 in 2014. The 17.2 percent spike follows increases of 4.6 percent and 6.7 percent in the previous two years.\n\nBy contrast, a Bureau of Justice Statistics survey in June 2017 said that on average each year between 2004 and 2015, there were 250,000 hate crime victimizations, defined as a single victim or household that experienced a criminal incident believed to be motivated by hate.\n\nThe two reports differ in that the Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019 National Crime Victimization Survey includes hate crimes both reported and unreported to police.\n\nSingh said he has seen an improvement over the past few years in law enforcement reporting hate crimes to the FBI. But he still believes the numbers are undercounted, which he said affects communities targeted by hate crimes.\n\n\u201cIt definitely dis-incentivizes anyone\u2019s ability to want to report things to law enforcement because they believe that their reports are not going to be taken seriously and that the response is not going to be appropriately handled,\u201d he said.\n\nSridaran said law enforcement and government both need to do more.\n\n\u201cI really think that it\u2019s incumbent on law enforcement, at the local level, to be reaching out more proactively to meet communities where they\u2019re at, in terms of the risk that they\u2019re facing for violence and reporting,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOn the government side,\u201d Sridaran added, \u201cthere just needs to be much more political will.\u201d\n\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "OECD says trade tensions are leading to a slowdown in global growth", "description": "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast that global growth would slow from 3.7 percent this year to 3.5 percent in 2019 and 2020.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/oecd-says-trade-tensions-are-leading-slowdown-global-growth-n938841", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2654256/181121-oecd-mc-1237_855fbc739eb71b51abc9b7e151e8f24d.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T12:43:17Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It had previously projected 3.7 percent for 2019.\n\nThe global growth slowdown would be worst in non-OECD countries, with many emerging-market economies likely to see capital outflows as the Federal Reserve gradually raised interest rates. The OECD cut its outlook for countries at risk such as Brazil, Russia, Turkey and South Africa.\n\nRising interest rates could also spur financial markets to reconsider and thus reprice the risks to which investors are exposed, triggering a return to volatility, the OECD said.\n\n\"We're returning to the long-term trend. We're not expecting a hard landing; however, there's a lot of risks. A soft landing is always difficult,\" OECD chief economist Laurence Boone told Reuters.\n\n\"This time it is more challenging than usual because of the trade tensions and because of capital flows from emerging markets to countries normalizing monetary policy,\" she added.\n\nA full-blown trade war and the resulting economic uncertainty could knock as much as 0.8 percent off global gross domestic product by 2021, the OECD calculated.\n\nThough at the source of the current tensions, the U.S. economy was expected to fare better than most other major economies, albeit because of costly fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe OECD left its forecasts for the United States in 2018 and 2019 unchanged, projecting growth in the world's biggest economy would slow from nearly 3.0 this year to slightly more than 2.0 percent in 2020 as the impact of tax cuts waned and higher tariffs added to business costs.\n\nTrimming its outlook for China, the OECD forecast the country's growth would slow from 6.6 percent to a 30-year low of 6.0 percent in 2020 as authorities tried to engineer a soft landing in the face of higher U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe outlook for the euro area was also slightly darker than in September, with growth seen slipping from nearly 2.0 percent this year to 1.6 percent in 2020 despite loose monetary policy over the period."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Erik Sherman", "title": "When CEOs go rogue, there's plenty of blame to pass around", "description": "Carlos Ghosn is not the only chief executive to be called out for his inner bad boy.

Papa John's no longer has John Schnatter as its face after the racial slur incident during a conference call. Critics have called for Mark Zuckerberg to at least step down as Facebook's chairman.\n\nMost CEOs do their work and stay out of the public eye. But some won't. It's almost as though they consider themselves reigning royalty.\n\nThat's about the gist of it, according to Yale management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an expert on leadership and governance. Such \"monarchic CEOs...believe there is one indispensable person,\" he told NBC News. \"They have a heroic mission and are driven by this need for immortality through their work and a separate drive for heroic stature. They don't have other interests. It's all the job.\"\n\nSonnenfeld says between 6 percent and 8 percent of public companies have problem CEOs who feel they should be able to do as they wish \u2014 and then set things up to make it difficult to be replaced. \"They often have undermined potential successors,\" said Sonnenfeld. By the time a crisis arises, the board feels trapped, that they have no leverage.\"\n\nA CEO in this mold who is highly successful may find that investors and the board of directors are first welcoming. But there's no guarantee that the good times will continue.\n\n\"They should make the same disclaimer of CEOs as they do for mutual funds: Past performance is not a predictor of future performance,\" said Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors. When entranced early on, a board may agree to provisions that literally put a CEO above the law. According to Minow, former Tyco International CEO Dennis Koslowski had a clause in his employment contract that said a felony could not be a cause for termination unless it was directly connected to the company's operations.\n\nDisgraced entertainment CEO Harvey Weinstein, when he ran The Weinstein Company, reportedly had a clause in his contract that gave him an out for sexual harassment claims, according to TMZ. By paying significant damages to the company, he could stay out of trouble if he \"treated someone improperly in violation of the company's Code of Conduct.\"\n\nUltimately, the CEO works for the shareholders through their representatives, the board of directors, who are supposed to provide oversight.\n\nHowever, the chief executive has extraordinary influence over who serves as directors. \"It's very hard for the board to really provide oversight and monitoring, and it's especially hard if the CEO is also the chair of the board,\" as Ghosn was, said Margarethe Wiersema, professor of strategy at the University of California, Irvine Paul Merage School of Business. The CEO/chair also controls the board's agenda and information it receives.\n\nThe biggest aid, Minow said, is to change the law so that shareholder votes on directors would be binding and not something the board could ignore. \"There was one case where all nine directors at a company failed to get support from the shareholders,\" she told NBC News. \"They turned their resignations in to each other and then they refused them and continued to serve. This was something we tried to get into Dodd-Frank [financial reform bill] unsuccessfully.\"\n\nAnd it's unlikely that the case of Ghosn will suddenly change things."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "China allows U.S. aircraft carrier to dock amid military tensions", "description": "Beijing has demanded the U.S. cease military activity of all kind near its South China Sea island claims that it has been rapidly fortifying.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/uss-ronald-reagan-docks-hong-kong-amid-military-tensions-n938816", "urlToImage": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/3449106/1000x563_3449106.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:32:46Z", "content": "HONG KONG A U.S. aircraft carrier docked in Hong Kong on Wednesday, days after a pair of American B-52 bombers flew over the disputed South China Sea.

Vietnam and Taiwan also claim the reef.\n\nThe platform appears to be topped with a radome and solar panels, and its strategic location makes it likely it is intended to extend China's radar or signals intelligence collection in the area, the report said. Bombay Reef already has a lighthouse to serve as an aid to navigation.\n\nUnlike China's large man-made islands created by piling sand on top of coral reefs, installing the modestly sized Bombay Reef platform did not require inflicting major environmental damage, CSIS said. However, that illustrates how easily China could expand its footprint to other features such as Scarborough Shoal, which it seized from the Philippines in 2012, it added.\n\nCompared to dredging and reclamation, the installation of a modest platform would be \"harder to prevent at the time and more difficult to rally international condemnation against after the fact,\" the report said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Fight breaks out onstage at Pusha T concert in rival Drake\u2019s hometown", "description": "Amateur video captured scenes of people brawling onstage during the rap artist\u2019s performance.

Officials said they were working with anthropologists to recover the body.\n\nJohn Allen Chau, 26, was identified as the victim by Jeff King, president of Washington, D.C.-based non-profit International Christian Concern.

He interacted with some of the tribespeople, offering gifts such as a football and fish. But the tribespeople became angry and shot an arrow at him, hitting a book he was carrying, Pathak said.\n\nAfter his kayak was damaged, Chau swam back to the fishermen's boat, which was waiting at a prearranged location. He spent the night writing about his experiences on pages that he then gave the fishermen, Pathak said. He set out again to meet the tribespeople on Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn't known. But on the morning of the following day, the waiting fishermen watched from a distance as the tribesmen dragged Chau's body. They left for Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where they broke the news to Chau's friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nPolice charged the seven fishermen with endangering the life of the American by taking him to a prohibited area.\n\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands are located at the juncture of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Tafline Laylin\n\nYou could lose hours of your life trying to find fresh organic cranberries for your Thanksgiving relish. Organic growers produced about 2.8 million pounds of the tart berries in 2016, a mere 0.3 percent of the overall market, according to a report by IndexBox, a market research publisher.\n\nBecause they are grown on vines in wetlands or bogs, cranberries are susceptible to an impressive suite of pests, fungal pathogens and weeds that are difficult to control, which makes organic growing particularly arduous.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped a small but determined band of farmers in Oregon and Washington from trying. There are now 11 cranberry farms in the two states that are certified organic, up from four in 2002, according to data from the USDA National Organic Program\u2019s Integrity Database, and there are 48 such farms nationwide.\n\nRichard Schmidt, a relative newcomer to the organic cranberry business, finds weeds particularly vexing. \u201cWe need a silver bullet that can control the weeds and leave the cranberries alone,\u201d he said.\n\nNearly three years ago, Schmidt bought his 64-acre farm in Bandon, along the Oregon coast, after retiring from the tire business. The previous owners had already begun transitioning some of the cranberry bogs to organic, a three-year process that involves using no pest, fungal or weed controls that are prohibited by USDA organic standards.\n\nSchmidt decided to continue the move toward organic. Since he\u2019s farming largely as a hobby and has money to invest in the business, he was able to give his cranberries what he called the \u201cCadillac experience,\u201d deploying double or triple the recommended amount of approved fertilizers and pest controls like Peruvian bird guano and organic-compliant insecticide.\n\nHis method appears to be working: In 2016, the farm\u2019s last year of transitioning to organic, he harvested 126,000 pounds of cranberries from 16 acres. This year, those same bogs produced 226,000 pounds of berries.\n\nAcross the U.S., the cranberry market is dominated by Ocean Spray, a cooperative owned by 700 growers. Aside from a few organic growers in Canada, Ocean Spray mostly sells conventional cranberries, with less stringent standards for fungal, pest and weed controls. Ocean Spray spokesperson Kellyanne Dignan said the cooperative\u2019s growers are \u201cexcellent stewards of the land\u201d driven by what consumers want.\n\nChemicals commonly used on cranberries include diazinon, a pesticide that controls insects on a range of fruit, vegetable, nut and field crops. The USDA Pesticide Data Program found that 5 percent of conventional cranberries sampled in 2016 had traces of diazinon. The pesticide was banned for residential use in 2005 based on the risk it posed to human health, though it is still allowed in agriculture."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hunger, disease have killed 85000 children under 5 during Yemen war, Save the Children says - NBCNews.com", "description": "NBCNews.com Hunger, disease have killed 85000 children under 5 during Yemen war, Save the Children says NBCNews.com SANAA, Yemen \u2014 An estimated 85,000 children under age 5 may have died of hunger and disease since the outbreak of Yemen's civil war in 2015, an\u2026", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hunger-disease-have-killed-85-000-children-under-5-during-n938821", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2654161/181121-yemen-famine-mc-928_71d5bc1af94c2503c060d6b9344b87e4.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T09:37:54Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He added, in another: \"I can't let perfection get in the way of progress.\"\n\nOne indication of imperfections has come from families, who have said they do not see their loved ones on the list, even they have been reported missing.\n\nA woman in Tennessee told the San Francisco Chronicle that her mother hasn't been heard from but did not appear on the list. Chrissy Mullinax told the newspaper she reported her mother missing to the Sheriff's office 10 days ago. But it was a posting on Facebook that helped locate the elder Mullinax and confirm that she was okay, her daughter said. \"They're doing much better than the [sheriff's] hotline,\" Mullinax said.\n\nAuthorities have declined to speculate how many of those listed as missing might have died in the fire, which had burned 151,000 acres and 12,637 residences as of Tuesday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nButte County officials decided to compile a list of those believed to be missing in hopes of getting the public to report those who made it out of the fire safely.\n\nAuthorities in previous disasters have not always published lists of the missing. In last year's Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County, the sheriff's office announced it received 2,269 missing persons reports, but didn't name them individually.\n\n\"We knew it was changing minute by minute,\" said Sgt. Spencer Crum, spokesman for the Sonoma sheriff. \"It was extremely fluid and we didn't want to have any misinformation out there and we knew there would be errors.\"\n\nCrum said his remarks were not intended as a criticism of Butte County's list. \"They are two different counties, with two different populations and two different fire scenes,\" said Crum. \"I wouldn't second guess anything they are doing.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Doha Madani", "title": "Chipotle rehires manager in viral video incident labeled racist", "description": "Chipotle has rehired a manager after more information came out regarding a controversial viral video where staff were seen refusing to serve a group of black men.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chipotle-rehires-manager-viral-video-incident-labeled-racist-n938141", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_29/2076501/170715-chipotle-restaurant-ew-1227p_5fa0d17495b09c2189e8632005bc9e95.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T02:04:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Chipotle tweeted later Friday that the company was firing Moran and re-training employees at the location.\n\n\"What happened here is not how our employees should treat our customers,\" the company tweeted in reply to Ali Friday. \"We are committed to treating all of our guests fairly and with respect. The manager has been terminated and the restaurant has been retrained so this doesn't happen again. We'll be back in touch.\"\n\nSocial media sleuths, however, unearthed tweets Ali allegedly posted about dining and dashing years prior. When those posts were brought to light, Chipotle reversed its decision on Monday and re-hired Moran after receiving screenshots of the tweets online. The screenshots of what appear to be now-deleted tweets by Ali could not be verified by NBC News.\n\n\"Based on our review, we have offered our manager her job back,\" Chipotle said in a statement. \"While our normal protocol was not followed serving these customers, we publicly apologize to our manager for being put in this position. We will work to continue to ensure that we support a respectful workplace for our employees and our customers alike.\"\n\nMoran told the Minneapolis Star Tribune on Tuesday that she was just trying to stand up for her employees, who were tired of dealing with cheapskates. She described the interaction as \"frightening\" but wanted to be clear that the men would have to pay that day.\n\n\"I should have been more clear that they were denied service,\u201d Moran said. \"I never meant, 'show me your money,' but more like 'please pay for your food.'\"\n\nMoran also said she has not decided whether she will return to her position."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Alex Johnson", "title": "Ben McAdams beats Mia Love, flips Utah House seat to the Democrats, AP projects", "description": "It took two weeks, but a win for Ben McAdams, the mayor of Salt Lake County, would give Democrats 38 new House seats, with three other House races yet to be called.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/ben-mcadams-beats-mia-love-flips-utah-house-seat-democrats-n938756", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2653971/181120-ben-mcadams-ac-8pm_e8ed848571b42f044d24c4284dda8571.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:57:40Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Cindy Hyde-Smith Tuesday in their debate, accusing her of having given their state \"another black eye\" on racial issues when she said recently that she would attend a \"public hanging\" if invited.\n\nHyde-Smith had just finished defending her remarks after a question from one of the panelists as the two faced off one week before voters choose between them in next Tuesday's runoff election, the final contest of the midterm election season.\n\n\"This comment was twisted, was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\" Hyde-Smith, offering that, to anyone offended, \"I certainly apologize.\"\n\nEspy fired back.\n\n\"No one twisted your comments,\" he said. \"They came out of your mouth. I don't know what's in your heart \u2014 but we all know what came out of your mouth....It's caused our state harm. It's given our state another black eye that we don't need.\"\n\nHyde-Smith brought unwanted national attention to Mississippi after video surfaced of her saying earlier this month at a campaign event in Tupelo that she would be \"on the front row\" if a local rancher \"invited me to a public hanging.\"\n\nBecause of the state's history of lynchings and other racially motivated killings, Democrats and civil rights advocates ripped into Hyde-Smith. Since then, a recording of Hyde-Smith encouraging voter suppression and a photo of her in a confederate cap also have added fuel to the firestorm over race.\n\nEspy's campaign has called her an embarrassment to a state that has tried to demonstrate that its past is not reflective of its current values.\n\nThe special election runoff to fill the remainder of former Sen. Thad Cochran's term \u2014 which runs through January 2021 \u2014 will be decided Nov. 27.\n\nIn the Nov. 6 election, Hyde-Smith finished first, just ahead of Espy, in the three-way open primary. Because Hyde-Smith did not win a majority \u2014 she got 41.5 percent to Espy's 40.6 percent with Republican Chris McDaniel taking 16.5 percent \u2014 the top two finishers were forced into the runoff.\n\nHyde-Smith brushed off the public hanging comment, saying last week in a printed statement that any attempts to turn her her remark \"into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\" When asked by reporters to elaborate, she would only say that she already had put out a statement on the matter.\n\nAt Hyde-Smith's request, the debate hall on Tuesday night was closed to the public and the press \u2014 other than the panel of journalists who were part of the program.\n\nIn limited head-to-head public polling, Hyde-Smith has held a lead.\n\nMississippi hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1982, when John C. Stennis, who first endeared himself to the state's voters as an ardent segregationist in the 1940s, won a sixth full term.\n\nIf Hyde-Smith wins, Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate in January. If voters pick Espy, that edge will be 52-48.\n\nDuring the debate, Hyde-Smith tied herself tightly to President Donald Trump, using her opening and closing statements to point to his planned two-stop campaign visit to help her next Monday.\n\nShe portrayed Espy, a former congressman and U.S. agriculture secretary, as a pawn of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other Democrats in Washington.\n\n\"My opponent is too liberal for Mississippi,\" Hyde-Smith said. \"You know I will stand up and protect our conservative values.\"\n\nAnd she rebuked Espy for having lobbied on behalf of the government of then-Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo, whom she noted is on trial for crimes against humanity.\n\nEspy said that he dropped his contract with the dictator and later explained to reporters that he would not return the $750,000 he was paid because he had fulfilled his obligations and had used some of the money to hire subcontractors.\n\nEspy also said that, if elected, he would try to reach across the partisan divide in Washington and maintain independence on behalf of Mississippians. In doing so, he also sought to cozy up to Trump, to a point.\n\n\"Mississippi first,\" he said of his approach, echoing Trump's \"America first\" slogan.\n\nAt the end of the debate, Espy returned to Hyde-Smith's hanging remark, portraying her sentiments as representative of the state's past.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going back to yesteryear,\" he said. \"We are moving forward.\"\n\nThe debate, held at the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation, was hosted by WLBT, the NBC affiliate in Jackson."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Alex Johnson", "title": "A 'great doctor': ER physician broke down as he treated colleague after Chicago shooting", "description": "Dr. Tamara O'Neal, who died Monday, was \"very passionate and compassionate with her patients,\" said a former colleague who was on duty when she came into the ER.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doctor-broke-down-he-treated-colleague-after-chicago-shooting-n938701", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2653661/181120-chicago-shooting-victim-dr-tamara-oneal-ac-520p_634bda634cf82c1e8e7c95fe90f85ef0.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:26:11Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

A number of suspects remained outstanding and subject to arrest warrants, LAPD Capt. Marc Reina said.\n\nThe felony complaint against the nine includes allegations of circulating a petition with false names, voter fraud, registering a fictitious person, and registering a nonexistent person, prosecutors said.\n\nIn a statement the District Attorney's office said suspects offered \"money and cigarettes to homeless people on Skid Row in exchange for false and forged signatures on ballot petitions and voter registration forms.\"\n\nThe case comes as national discourse over voter fraud heated up in November. President Trump, who has in the past alleged that \"millions\" of bogus votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election, recently said, without evidence, that there were \"forged\" ballots and \"found\" votes during the midterm election in Florida.\n\nThe specter of voter fraud has led a movement in some conservative states to enact strict identification and address requirements, a move described by critics as voter disenfranchisement that disproportionately affects the poor and people of color.\n\nThe counter argument has been that voter fraud is extremely rare. But the case in Los Angeles could upend that claim.\n\n\"Democrats in California continue to pretend voter fraud doesn\u2019t exist,\" Matt Fleming, spokesman for the Republican Party of California, said via email. \"However, this incident highlights the need for more investigation of claims.\"\n\nLinda Paine, president and co-founder of Election Integrity Project California, said she was \"pleased to see\" authorities taking the matter seriously. But she expressed concern.\n\n\"California's electoral process is based on the honor system,\" she said. \"We know not everyone is honest. We are going to have our attorneys look into this as well.\"\n\nThe press secretary for California Secretary of State Alex Padilla declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe LAPD's Reina says its investigation started in spring after officers encountered long lines of people on Skid Row during off hours allegedly accepting cash, cigarettes and even snacks in exchange for bogus signatures.\n\nHe said suspects, sitting at tables set up on sidewalks, had voter registration roll printouts and asked participants to illegally sign the names of what appeared to be legitimate voters. He said the scheme was busted by undercover officers posing as homeless people. Surveillance cameras also captured some of the alleged crimes, he said.\n\nIt's not clear if the scheme, which prosecutors said applied to the 2016 and 2018 elections, had an impact on whether or not initiatives qualified. Investigators are \"trying to follow where the money\u2019s coming from, and who had knowledge of this practice,\" Reina said.\n\nLos Angeles County Registrar of Voters Dean Logan said previously that he believes any bogus signatures would have been weeded out by his office.\n\nVia email late Tuesday he added, \"We are glad that the district attorney is actively ensuring the integrity of the election process by pursuing those who take part in fraudulent petition practices. Our office takes any activity that causes voters to lose faith in the process very seriously.\"\n\nDefendants were identified as Kirkland Kauzava Washington, 38; Harold Bennett, 53; Louis Thomas Wise, 36; Richard Howard, 62; Rose Makeda Sweeney, 42; Christopher Joseph Williams, 59; Jakara Fati Mardis, 35; Norman Hall, 61; and Nickey Demelvin Huntley, 44.\n\nCity attorney's cases against Wise and Bennett were withdrawn in favor of the district attorney's prosecution, a spokesman for L.A.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Jasmin Boyce\n\nBitcoin plunged below $5,000 on Monday, adding to what has turned into nightmare 2018 for investors who touted the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe continued declines come after bitcoin\u2019s value shot up in December 2017, nearly touching $20,000. As of Tuesday, a single Bitcoin was trading around $4,400 \u2014 its lowest level of the year.\n\nBitcoin is not alone. Other popular cryptocurrencies have also plunged throughout the year, touching fresh lows this week. A cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that is based on technology known as blockchain, in which computers compete against each other to solve complex math problems. That computing power creates a distributed, secure and transparent network ledger \u2014 commonly known as a blockchain \u2014 on which applications such as bitcoin can be built.\n\nThe rise in enthusiasm for bitcoin led to a rush of investment and speculation around cryptocurrencies and blockchain-related startups. Growing hopes that rising prices would attract institutions such as banks and governments also served to further lend legitimacy to bitcoin. Some analysts once predicted that bitcoin\u2019s value could reach $100,000.\n\nBut declining prices have been met by growing skepticism and exacerbated by claims that bitcoin\u2019s previous price increases were artificially inflated. The U.S. Justice Department is currently investigating whether bitcoin\u2019s high market value last year was an outcome of traders manipulating the market. Investigators speculated that some traders of the cryptocurrency used Tether, a cryptocurrency used to predict the prices of other cryptocurrencies, to foster rises in bitcoin.\n\nPatrick Paul Palacios, president and CEO of LoyalCoin, a company that offers a blockchain-based company rewards programs, said the investigation was one of the many reasons for bitcoin\u2019s decline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of all these factors, which includes, of course, that everybody\u2019s panicking.\u201d Palacios said.\n\nPalacios added that people who had invested in bitcoin when the price was rising rapidly were probably unprepared for a drop, leading to more volatility as people sold their investments.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand how crypto is working,\u201d Palacios said. \u201cThere\u2019s really a lot of volatility here for the newbies.\u201d\n\nShone Anstey, executive chairman and co-founder of Blockchain Intelligence Group, explained how money quickly put into bitcoin by novice investors last year is just as quickly being taken out now as investors are \u201ctrying to lock in their gains before they evaporate.\u201d\n\n\u201cFast money moving in,\u201d Anstey said. \u201cFast money getting taken out.\u201d\n\nThough the value of bitcoin is on a downward trend, Anstey warned against counting out the cryptocurrency or underlying blockchain technology.\n\n\u201cWe overestimate technologies in the short term, but tremendously underestimate them in the long term.\u201d Anstey said.\n\nWhile some analysts predict a recovery in the long term, others suggest a turnaround could happen by the end of 2018.\n\nTom Lee, a Wall Street strategist, stood by his $15,000 year-end prediction for bitcoin during an interview with CNBC Tuesday.\n\nLee predicted that incoming waves of \u201cinstitutional\u201d adoption and \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d were factors that would eventually drive the market price of bitcoin upwards again."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dareh Gregorian and Reuters and The Associated Press", "title": "'El Chapo' trial: Witness says he bribed top Mexican officials", "description": "Testifying in the trial of Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman Loera, a former member of the Sinaloa Cartel said he paid off top Mexican officials", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/el-chapo-trial-witness-says-he-bribed-top-mexican-officials-n938741", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/1530331/160509-el-chapo-guzman_9df0d4ba9bedc4e2e236fca125cf1ada.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:27:34Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Zambada said he paid Regino \"a few million\" on behalf of his brother, who prosecutors say runs the Sinaloa Cartel with Guzman.\n\nRegino, who now works as a criminal law professor in Mexico, took to Twitter to deny the allegations, calling them \"false\" in Spanish.\n\nZambada also recounted handing over a suitcase with $3 million inside to Genero Garcia Luna in 2005 or 2006, when he was director of Mexico's Federal Investigation Agency. He said he gave him millions more a year or two later, when he was named secretary of public security.\n\nEfforts to reach Garcia Luna by Reuters were not successful.\n\nZambada made the claims while being cross-examined by Guzman's lawyer William Purpura.\n\nAttorneys for Guzman maintain he's been \"framed\" as a drug lord, and the real leader of the Sinaloa Cartel and its multi-billion dollar drug business is Zambada's brother, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada. \"El Mayo\" is still on the loose, likely somewhere in the mountains, his brother testified.\n\nZambada has testified that \"El Chapo\" and his brother were partners, and has portrayed Guzman as a bloodthirsty hothead whose favorite weapon was a diamond-encrusted pistol. On Monday, he recounted his brother telling him that Guzman ordered a competitor killed after the rival had refused to shake his hand in a 2004 meeting.\n\nGuzman, 61, is standing trial on a 17-count indictment on drug trafficking, murder conspiracy and money laundering charges. He faces life in prison if convicted.\n\nIn Mexico, he had already been sentenced to 20 years behind bars on drug trafficking charges in 1993, but then escaped the Puente Grande Federal Prison in Guadalajara in 2001.

A federal judge on Tuesday struck down a Mississippi abortion law that bans \u2026 [+3326 chars]", "fulltext": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nJACKSON, Miss. \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday struck down a Mississippi abortion law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks, one of the most restrictive in the United States.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled that the law \"unequivocally\" violates women's constitutional rights.\n\n\"The record is clear: States may not ban abortions prior to viability,\" Reeves said, citing Supreme Court rulings.\n\nThe only abortion clinic in Mississippi sued when Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed the law March 19, and Reeves issued a temporary restraining order the next day to keep the state from enforcing the law.\n\nThe Mississippi law and the responding lawsuit set up a confrontation sought by abortion opponents, who are hoping federal courts will ultimately prohibit abortions before a fetus is viable outside the womb, the dividing line that the U.S. Supreme Court set in its 1973 ruling saying that women have the right to terminate pregnancies. An Iowa law, also challenged in court, bans most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected.\n\nThe Mississippi law would allow exceptions to the 15-week ban in cases of medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality. Doctors found in violation of the ban would face mandatory suspension or revocation of their medical license.\n\nA national abortion-rights group, the Center for Reproductive Rights, helped represent the Mississippi clinic.\n\n\"Our victory today means that women in Mississippi will maintain the ability to make their own decisions about whether and when to terminate a pregnancy,\" Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the center, said in a statement Tuesday. \"Today's decision should be a wake-up call for state lawmakers who are continuously trying to chip away at abortion access. Such bans will not stand in a court of law.\"\n\nBryant was traveling Tuesday and it was not immediately clear whether he would ask a federal appeals court to overturn Reeves' ruling. He has said abortion restrictions are meant to protect women's health.\n\nReeves wrote that \"this Court concludes that the Mississippi Legislature's professed interest in 'women's health' is pure gaslighting.\" He cited the state's high infant mortality statistics and noted that Mississippi has not expanded Medicaid, which is an option most states have taken under the 2010 federal health law signed by then-President Barack Obama.\n\nClinic escorts Kim Gibson, left, and Derenda Hancock, second from left, and anti-abortion sidewalk counselors Beka Tate, second from right, and Lauren, stand outside the Jackson Women's Health Organization's clinic, on March 20, 2018 in Jackson, Mississippi. Rogelio V. Solis / AP file\n\nReeves also wrote that the 15-week abortion ban \"is closer to the old Mississippi \u2014 the Mississippi bent on controlling women and minorities.\"\n\nBryant has said frequently that he wants Mississippi to be \"the safest place in America for an unborn child.\" At a Nov. 12 news conference where Republican U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith received an endorsement from the president of the national Right to Life Committee, Bryant talked about what he saw as \"the genocide of over 20 million African-American children\" in the U.S. since a 1973 Supreme Court ruling that made abortion legal in all states.\n\n\"I am confused about where the outrage is at \u2014 about 20 million African-American children that have been aborted,\" Bryant said. \"No one wants to say anything about that. No one wants to talk about that.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Four people dead in New Jersey fire mystery", "description": "One adult was found shot outside the burning New Jersey mansion on Tuesday.
