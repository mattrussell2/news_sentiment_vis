The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Allan Smith\n\nA video surfaced Thursday of Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi saying it might be a \"great idea\" to make it harder for some people to vote, and her campaign quickly responded that she was \"obviously\" joking.\n\nHyde-Smith, who is in a runoff against Democrat Mike Espy on Nov. 27, made the remark at a campaign stop in Starkville, Mississippi, on Nov. 3. It was posted to Twitter on Thursday by Lamar White Jr., publisher of The Bayou Brief. Smith earlier this week posted video of Hyde-Smith making a comment on Nov. 2 about a \"public hanging\" that started a controversy.\n\n\"And then they remind me that there's a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who ... maybe we don't want to vote,\" Hyde-Smith is heard saying. \"Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that's a great idea.\"\n\nMelissa Scallan, a spokeswoman for Hyde-Smith's campaign, said in a statement shortly after the video was posted that the senator \"obviously\" was \"making a joke and clearly the video was selectively edited.\"\n\nDanny Blanton, a spokesman for Espy's campaign, called Hyde-Smith a \"walking stereotype who embarrasses our state.\"\n\n\"For a state like Mississippi, where voting rights were obtained through sweat and blood, everyone should appreciate that this is not a laughing matter,\" Blanton said in a statement.\n\nThe episode comes after that first controversial video was posted to Twitter on Sunday. In that video, Hyde-Smith is heard saying during a campaign stop in Tupelo on Nov. 2 that if the man who was next to her, later identified as a local rancher, \"invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\"\n\nCritics said the comment had a racial connotation in the context of Mississippi's history of lynching. Hyde-Smith said in a statement soon after the remark was posted that she \"referred to accepting an invitation to a speaking engagement\" and \"used an exaggerated expression of regard.\"\n\n\"Any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous,\" she added.\n\nHyde-Smith then faced repeated questioning about the comment when she appeared Monday at a news conference alongside Republican Gov. Phil Bryant to announce an endorsement from the National Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion rights group. She deferred to her initial statement and refused to comment further."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "FAO Schwarz making Christmas comeback", "description": "After closing its doors in 2015,  the famed New York City store will reopen at Rockefeller Plaza on Friday, just in time for Christmas.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/fao-schwarz-making-christmas-comeback-1371909187684", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/nn_gsc_return_of_fao_schwarz_181115_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:54:48Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "FAO Schwarz making Christmas comeback copied!\n\nAfter closing its doors in 2015, the famed New York City store will reopen at Rockefeller Plaza on Friday, just in time for Christmas.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Viral GoFundMe campaign for homeless veteran was a hoax, prosecutors say", "description": "More than $400,000 poured in after Kate McClure and her boyfriend started a GoFundMe for Johnny Bobbitt, a homeless veteran, who reportedly gave his last $20 to the help the stranded woman get home.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Alex Johnson\n\nThe Defense Department has failed an audit almost three decades in the making, the Pentagon's No. 2 official said Thursday. But the results were expected and showed what the agency already knew \u2014 that \"more work lies ahead of us.\"\n\nCongress first required the Defense Department to undertake a comprehensive audit in 1990, but the agency didn't manage to get around to it until late last year.\n\n\"Everyone was betting against us that we would even do the audit,\" Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters, adding: \"It was an audit on a $2.7 trillion organization. The fact we did the audit is substantial.\"\n\nThe announcement came a day after the National Defense Strategy Commission, an independent agency appointed by Congress, reported that the Defense Department isn't financially or strategically set up to wage two wars at once and could even lose a war against China or Russia individually.\n\n\"The U.S. military could suffer unacceptably high casualties and loss of major capital assets in its next conflict,\" it said.\n\nThe audit itself and an inspector general's report on it aren't expected to be released until later Thursday at the earliest. But in a preview for reporters, Shanahan said: \"We failed the audit, but we never expected to pass it.\"\n\nAfter the briefing, a Defense Department spokesman, Army Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino, clarified in an email to Reuters that \"the audit is not a 'pass-fail' process.\"\n\n\"We did not receive an 'adverse' finding \u2014 the lowest possible category \u2014 in any area,\" Buccino told Reuters. \"We did receive findings of 'disclaimer' in multiple areas. Clearly more work lies ahead of us.\"\n\nShanahan said the Defense Department had been getting preliminary findings since the massive audit began \u2014 involving 1,200 auditors counting and assessing equipment, property, accounts and spending across 21 Pentagon agencies \u2014 and was already at work on taking corrective action.\n\nMajor issues the audits highlight include compliance with cybersecurity policies and improving inventory accuracy, Shanahan said. He didn't say how much money was unaccounted for.\n\n\"Some of the compliance issues are irritating to me,\" he said. \"Some of those things frustrated me because we have a job to do; we just need to follow our procedures.\"\n\nAsked whether the audit could undermine public confidence in the Defense Department, Shanahan said, \"We count ships right.\"\n\nHe said he hoped taxpayers would conclude: \"'Good.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Benjy Sarlin\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A sweeping ethics bill by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is making the jump to the newly Democratic House.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., plans to introduce companion legislation in the coming days that she hopes will become a rallying point for progressives.\n\nThe Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act is headlined by a lifetime ban on lobbying by former lawmakers, presidents and top executive branch appointees, but includes a wide array of additional provisions.\n\nJayapal is introducing companion legislation to Warren's that she hopes will become a rallying point for progressives. Andrew Harnik / AP file\n\nSome connect directly to President Donald Trump\u2019s conduct in office, like a proposed requirement that presidents make tax returns public and sell off companies to avoid conflicts of interest. Others touch on recent scandals in the administration and Congress, including a provision banning individual stock trading by government officials and another banning Americans from lobbying for foreign governments.\n\n\u201cThe influence of money cannot be overstated in this town,\u201d Warren said Thursday in a phone interview with NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of different places to fight back, and that\u2019s what this bill is about.\u201d\n\nWith Republicans holding onto the Senate after the midterm elections, Warren\u2019s version likely isn\u2019t getting a vote anytime soon. But the upcoming Democratic Congress looks more promising: Leaders have already announced they plan to include a separate package of ethics reforms in their first bill, H.R. 1.\n\nJayapal, who serves as vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, says she supports that legislation but is hoping her own bill with Warren helps pressure Democrats to go further.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to think they can just sort of clap their hands and say \u2018We passed H.R. 1, we\u2019re done,\u2019 because the problems run deep,\u201d said Jayapal Thursday.\n\nOne obstacle the two identified in building support among their colleagues is concern that a far-reaching bill might open members up to a political counterattack for not having voluntarily instituted the same rules in the past.\n\nJayapal said she had nicknamed their legislation the \u201cNobody\u2019s Perfect\u201d bill to reassure members that the goal was to create a new set of rules moving forward rather than to harangue potential co-sponsors for following the current ones.\n\n\u201cWhen we pass it, we will all be compliant,\" she said. \"That\u2019s the point of it.\"\n\nWarren and other Senate Democrats faced hypocrisy charges of their own during the midterm cycle, as critics pushed them to cast out Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who was \u201cseverely admonished\u201d by the Senate Ethics Committee for accepting flights and luxury accommodations from a donor who was later convicted of fraud.\n\nMenendez survived an indictment on related corruption charges last year, which the Justice Department dropped after a mistrial, and won re-election last week. Prominent Democrats like Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., campaigned for him and Warren\u2019s campaign committee donated $5,000 to a victory fund backing him, according to FEC disclosures first reported on by the Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cI helped a lot of my colleagues at the federal level and the state level and helped state Democratic parties, but this isn\u2019t about politics,\" Warren said. \"This about how we make Washington a place that works for the people.\"\n\nAsked whether Menendez should resign, Warren said her focus was on \u201cbuilding a government we can believe in going forward\u201d with more stringent rules that would make clear to lawmakers what behavior is over the line.\n\nWhile so far there are no Republican sponsors for Warren\u2019s bill, she said she sees some potential for cooperation across party lines. She said she\u2019s held discussions with Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., after he put out an ethics bill of his own this year that included some similar features.\n\nEither way, with Warren considered likely to run for president, an ongoing push to pass the measure in the House could keep it a high-profile issue during a campaign.\n\n\u201cPeople in Congress understand the influence of money on the political process,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey know that we need change. We just need to have the courage to step up and do it.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Allan Smith", "title": "'Creep shot': Firestorm over photo of Ocasio-Cortez posted on Twitter", "description": "The reporter, Eddie Scarry of The Washington Examiner, was met with backlash after posting a photo of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly-elected congresswoman.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/creep-shot-firestorm-over-photo-ocasio-cortez-posted-twitter-n936906", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_44/2536391/180819-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-al-1143_c50eed93531ba763b31823392fb7aef5.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:17:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Phil Helsel\n\nDesign errors in a 174-foot-long span of a pedestrian bridge that collapsed in Miami earlier this year, killing six people, were consistent with the cracking seen before the disaster, federal investigators said Thursday in a preliminary report.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board released the findings Thursday in a two-page investigative update and said the cause of the collapse has not been determined.\n\nThe Florida International University pedestrian bridge collapsed on March 15, crushing cars below. Six people died and eight others were injured. Five of the dead were occupants of vehicles; a bridge worker also was killed.\n\nThe NTSB said errors were made in the design of the \u201cnorthernmost nodal region of the span where two truss members were connected to the bridge deck,\u201d and that those errors resulted in an overestimation of the capacity and an underestimation of the load placed on that section.\n\nThe agency\u2019s investigative update said that \"the cracking observed in the node prior to the collapse is consistent with the identified errors.\"\n\nThe lead engineer of FIGG Bridge Engineers, the company that led the design of the walkway, left a voicemail with the Florida Department of Transportation about the cracks two days before the collapse.\n\nBut the message, left on a landline, was not heard until a day after the collapse because the employee it was intended for was out of the office on assignment, the department said in March. The voicemail said, in part, that \"from a safety perspective, we don't see that there\u2019s any issue there so we're not concerned about it from that perspective\" but that it would have to be repaired, according to a transcript.\n\nThe Florida Department of Transportation in October acknowledged that the department employee returned from the assignment on the day of the collapse, before the bridge fell, but did not listen to the message until the day after, NBC Miami reported. The agency said in October that its original statement could have been worded better, the station reported.\n\n\"The investigation continues to examine the design, review, and construction processes as well as the actions taken once the cracking was observed,\" the NTSB said in the update Thursday.\n\nThe transportation safety board said the Turner-Fairbanks Highway Research Center, which is part of the Federal Highway Administration, conducted tests on concrete and steel samples taken from the collapsed bridge, and that those tests determined the samples did meet \"the project's build plans specified minimum requirements.\"\n\nThe FIU pedestrian bridge was constructed with a relatively new form of construction known as accelerated bridge construction, a method designed to speed construction while maintaining safety.\n\nOne of those killed was Alexa Duran, 18, a freshman at FIU, who was driving from a doctor\u2019s appointment when the bridge collapsed on her car. Her parents sued.\n\nTheir attorney, Alan Goldfarb, said the findings were \"a good start\" and confirmed what they suspected, which is there were design, engineering and construction flaws with the project.\n\n\"There are many, many professionals and workers who ignored the cracks ... and they failed to cry out to anyone to stop construction, and at the very least stop vehicular traffic,\" Goldfarb said. \u201cThat was the worst thing you can imagine, leaving that going.\"\n\nWorkers stand next to a section of a collapsed pedestrian bridge on March 16 near Florida International University in Miami. Wilfredo Lee / AP\n\nA friend of Duran's, Richard Humble, who was inside the car but survived, has said they heard a creak overhead before the collapse.\n\n\"We tried to duck, but at the same time, it was just way too fast,\" Humble told \"Today\" a day after the collapse. \"I screamed her name over and over again, but I didn't hear anything.\"\n\nOther lawsuits were filed after the collapse, including by the family of truck driver Rolando Fraga, 60, who was also killed. An attorney in that lawsuit said the roadway should have been closed to traffic as work continued on the bridge.\n\nThe planned walkway connected the FIU campus to the town of Sweetwater, where the university estimates roughly 4,000 students live. It was expected to open in early 2019.\n\nFIU said in a statement Thursday that it is fully cooperating with the NTSB investigation.\n\n\"We hope the results of the investigation will help bring closure to the families and loved ones of the victims,\" said Kenneth Jessell, senior vice president for finance and administration and chief financial officer."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Doha Madani", "title": "Former Alabama trooper killed after district attorney shot in the face", "description": "A former Alabama state trooper was shot dead by police after allegedly shooting a district attorney in the face outside his office.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-alabama-trooper-killed-after-district-attorney-shot-face-n936931", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2648251/181115-alabama-district-attorney-shot-ew-624p_7b269ab707e982596cd08b75df650c55.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:07:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Jon Schuppe\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s support has put Congress within reach of passing the most sweeping set of changes to the federal criminal justice system since the 1990s, when fear of crime drove the enactment of draconian sentencing practices that shipped hundreds of thousands of drug offenders to prison.\n\nThis is no small feat. Reformers have been trying to get this done for years, but something always got in the way: partisan bickering, election-year politics, ambushes by opponents. Amid Washington gridlock, the First Step Act stands out.\n\nThe measure, which could go to a vote during the lame-duck session of Congress between now and January, contains several changes to the way the federal government treats drug offenders, both those who are in prison now and those who will face a judge in the future.\n\nIf it is passed, thousands of federal prisoners would have access to more help preparing for life after the end of their sentences. Thousands of well-behaved prisoners would win freedom earlier. And thousands of people who are arrested for drug crimes in the future would become eligible for exemptions from harsh mandatory minimum sentencing laws.\n\nStill, the bill stops short of what many reformers say is needed to curb prison spending, relieve staff shortages and overcrowding, and make the justice system fairer. That is why they say the First Step Act is exactly that: a start.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the federal prison system, with 183,000 inmates, is tiny in comparison to America\u2019s total incarcerated population of 1.5 million. State prison systems make up the vast majority of that population, and that is where reform efforts have been spreading for years. Many states, both red and blue, have cut their prison populations while also seeing drastic reductions in crime.\n\n\u201cThe only reason we\u2019ve gotten to the point of these federal reforms, which we think will be transformative, is the fact that states have applied them and have data they can point to that can persuade the tough-on-crime crowd,\u201d said Mark Holden, chairman of Freedom Partners, which makes conservative arguments for criminal justice reform. \u201cIt is hard to argue against that, and it\u2019s all based on data.\u201d\n\nHere is what the First Step Act would do:\n\nGive some prisoners a break\n\nNearly a decade ago, Congress addressed one of the most glaring inequities of the drug war-era sentencing laws, which punished people convicted of crack cocaine-related offenses (most often poor residents of urban areas) much more harshly than those convicted of powder cocaine-related crimes. The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced that disparity. The First Step Act would apply that correction to prisoners who were sentenced for crack offenses before the 2010 law passed. There are nearly 3,000 such prisoners, many of whom would become eligible to petition for their release immediately.\n\nThe First Step Act also changes the way the U.S. Bureau of Prisons calculates the amount of \u201cgood-time credit\u201d for prisoners who stay out of trouble behind bars, adding seven days of credit per year. Applied retroactively, that tweak means that an estimated 3,900 prisoners would be eligible to leave prison earlier in the first year the changes take effect.\n\nThe First Step Act also gives prisoners an incentive to participate in training and educational programs by awarding them points that speed their release to halfway houses or home confinement.\n\nThose programs would expand and improve under the bill, which allocates millions of dollars for the Bureau of Prisons to develop them.\n\nThe bill exempts several categories of prisoners from earning more credits, including convicted murderers, sex offenders, terrorists and spies, as well as immigrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally and people convicted of trafficking fentanyl.\n\nEase harsh sentences\n\nIn addition to helping certain people who are behind bars, the First Step Act addresses some aspects of the system\u2019s \u201cfront end\u201d \u2014 the laws that guide how prison sentences are determined.\n\nOne addresses \u201csafety valves\u201d that allow judges to diverge from mandatory minimum sentencing laws. The current system allows judges to give lower sentences to nonviolent drug offenders with little or no prior criminal history; the First Step Act would allow judges to apply those safety valves to nonviolent drug offenders with longer criminal histories. This provision would benefit about 2,100 offenders annually, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nGiving judges more discretion over sentencing decisions \"is probably the most significant piece of the legislation, and the one we were most concerned about staying in the bill,\u201d said Holly Harris, a longtime Republican strategist who leads the U.S. Justice Action Network, which recruits lawmakers on the left and right to overhaul the criminal justice system.\n\nAnother piece of the First Step Act would restrict a common practice among prosecutors to seek longer sentences by adding gun charges against a drug defendant even if the gun wasn\u2019t used or fired. The law was meant to target repeat offenders, but it has been used to \u201cstack\u201d charges against first-time offenders, adding up to 25 years to their sentences. This would affect about 60 defendants a year, reducing their potential sentences by about half, the Congressional Budget Office has said.\n\nAnother 60 defendants a year would benefit from a reduction in mandatory minimum sentences for repeat serious drug offenders, including the elimination of life without parole for someone with three or more prior drug offenses.\n\nThose three sentencing changes were retroactive in prior versions of the bill, but in the new version they will only apply going forward \u2014 a concession to bring more skeptical lawmakers on board, said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, one of the measure\u2019s authors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably true that each of us could find something to disagree with in this bill,\u201d Grassley said in a statement Thursday. \u201cBut an opportunity to pass legislation like this that does so much good does not come often. And when it does come, we must join together and support it.\u201d\n\nThe First Step Act is considered a potentially landmark piece of legislation, the result of years of lobbying by advocates inside and outside of Congress. But the bill doesn\u2019t cure all of the system\u2019s shortcomings, they say.\n\nKara Gotsch, director of strategic initiatives at the Sentencing Project, a reform-advocacy organization, said she saw the First Step Act as progress, but it left \u201cso much more do to.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t end racial disparity in the system. It doesn\u2019t dramatically reduce the prison population,\u201d Gotsch said. \u201cEvery little bit helps, but it\u2019s not the end of the conversation.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Allan Smith", "title": "Gillum: 'Tens of thousands of votes' still not counted after Florida deadline passes", "description": "Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum trails Republican Ron DeSantis by 0.4 percent as the Thursday deadline to wrap up the machine recount passed.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/gillum-tens-thousands-votes-still-not-counted-after-florida-deadline-n936876", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2648156/181115-andrew-gillum-se-504p_b20e499b7d0e9f18aa9ed58ce8690a71.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:23:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Stacy and a number of other LGBTQ advocates expect Whitaker, who has been at DOJ in some capacity since September 2017, to continue in his former boss\u2019s footsteps.\n\n\"The appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney General signals that the anti-LGBTQ policies of Donald Trump, Mike Pence and Jeff Sessions will continue unchecked and unabated,\" Stacy said.\n\nPOLITICAL \u201cWITCH HUNT\u201d\n\nWhitaker began his political career in his home state of Iowa. In 2004, President George W. Bush appointed him as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, a role he remained in for five years.\n\nDuring his time in office, Whitaker investigated Matt McCoy, an openly gay state senator from Iowa\u2019s 21st District. Whitaker alleged McCoy extorted $2,000 from a business partner, a charge for which McCoy faced a possible 20-year jail sentence.\n\nMcCoy, who was eventually acquitted of the charges, recently called Whitaker\u2019s investigation a political \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and said he believes Whitaker targeted him in part due to his sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cAt the time, the national Democratic Party had named me among the 100 up-and-coming Democratic leaders to watch,\u201d McCoy wrote in an op-ed published by Politico on Sunday. \u201cI was young. I was liberal. I was popular. I had never been defeated. I had flirted with running for Congress. And I was openly gay, which surely didn\u2019t increase my popularity with social conservatives like Whitaker.\u201d\n\nMcCoy said his reputation is still damaged because of Whitaker\u2019s accusation.\n\n\u201cCULTURE WARRIORS\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Whitaker served as the emcee for a \u201cfamily values\u201d panel at the Conservative Principles Political Action Committee Conference in Des Moines. The panel consisted of leaders from some of the country\u2019s most strident anti-LGBTQ organizations, including Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage, and Connie Mackey of the Family Research Council.\n\nThe National Organization for Marriage fought against same-sex marriage, and the Family Research Council \u2014 which has been labeled an anti-LGBTQ \u201chate group\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2014 states on its website that \u201chomosexual conduct is harmful to the persons who engage in it and to society at large, and can never be affirmed.\u201d\n\nBefore Whitaker introduced the panelists, he invoked the \u201cculture wars,\u201d saying: \u201cNo, they\u2019re not over; we\u2019re still fighting.\u201d\n\nAnd after the panel, he doubled down by saying, \u201cWhat a great group of culture warriors,\u201d as he opened the floor to questions from the audience.\n\nWhitaker ran for the U.S. Senate in 2014, and on the campaign trail, he said he opposed the repeal of the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy and supported a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage.\n\nDuring the Republican primaries, Whitaker met with 15 Iowa home-schooling leaders, according to a local site, Caffeinated Thoughts, and expressed his displeasure at the Obama administration\u2019s decision three years before to permit gay people to serve openly in the armed services.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see our military treated as a Petri dish,\u201d he said in response to a veteran\u2019s question about the repeal of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d and having women serve in combat roles.\n\nDuring his Senate bid, Whitaker went on record supporting a constitutional amendment barring gay marriage, and in an interview at the time said: \u201cI believe marriage is between one man and one woman. Throughout history it\u2019s traditionally been up to the churches and to God to define that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring his time in Iowa politics, he tried to attack and dismantle LGBTQ rights and protections at every turn,\u201d Daniel Hoffman-Zinnel, executive director of LGBTQ rights group One Iowa, said of Whitaker\u2019s track record in the state.\n\nIn 2014, Whitaker told an audience gathered by the conservative Christian organization Family Leader that he thought all judges should have \u201ca biblical view of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they have a secular worldview, then I\u2019m going to be very concerned about how they judge,\u201d he said.\n\nJenny Pizer, law and policy director at LGBTQ legal organization Lambda Legal, said these comments are particularly troubling.\n\n\u201cThat raises alarm bells on multiple issues: a basic understanding of the separation of church and state, and a profession of an unusually extreme religious worldview on his part,\u201d Pizer explained.\n\n\u201cTHE GAYSTAPO\u201d\n\nAfter his failed Senate bid, Whitaker volunteered for First Liberty (formerly the Liberty Institute), a conservative organization focused on \u201cprotecting religious liberty.\u201d There he represented Bob Eschliman, an editor at Iowa\u2019s Newton Daily News. Eschliman was fired after publishing blog posts in which he called LGBTQ people \u201cthe enemy\u201d and the \u201cgaystapo.\u201d Eschliman lodged a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that his termination violated his civil rights.\n\nWhitaker argued on behalf of Eschliman that the company engaged in \"intentional discrimination in express contravention of Title VII\" of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, because, Whitaker argued, Eschliman was fired because of his \"sincerely held religious beliefs.\"\n\nDouglas NeJaime, an LGBTQ legal scholar and professor at Yale Law School, disagreed with Whitaker\u2019s interpretation of the law.\n\n\u201cHe actually wasn\u2019t discriminated against because he\u2019s evangelical or Christian or Catholic,\u201d NeJaime said of Eschliman. \u201cHe was terminated for expressing views publicly that he says are his religious views, but he isn't being discriminated against for his status as a religious person.\u201d\n\nThe case was settled out of court, but as acting attorney general, Whitaker is now in a position to define the federal government's position on similar cases regarding Title VII and religious liberty.\n\nUnder Sessions, the DOJ repeatedly articulated support for religious freedom over and above the civil rights of LGBTQ people, according to advocates, and moved to limit the scope of Title VII to exclude transgender employees.\n\nPizer said that Whitaker\u2019s past \u2014 from his on-the-record comments to his work for organizations like First Liberty, which declared the legalization of same-sex marriage the start of a \u201cnew religious freedom war\u201d \u2014 suggests that DOJ\u2019s current efforts to dismantle discrimination protections for LGBTQ people will continue apace.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was working pro bono for one of the religious conservative legal groups means he comes from a similar group of hard-right advocates from which this administration has selected consistently for its top leadership,\u201d Pizer added.\n\nThe DOJ did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on Whitaker and his record.\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "David K.

Li\n\nSeven women filed a $70 million lawsuit against Dartmouth College on Thursday, claiming the Ivy League school turned a blind eye to its \"21st Century Animal House\" culture and didn't do enough to protect them from sexually predatory professors.\n\nThe plaintiffs also include any other \"Jane Doe\" victims who were \"treated as sex objects\" by three now-former professors at Dartmouth's elite Department of Psychology and Brain Sciences, according to the civil lawsuit filed in Concord, New Hampshire, federal court.\n\n\"Dartmouth College has knowingly permitted three of its prominent (and well-funded) professors to turn a human behavior research department into a 21st Century Animal House,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nDartmouth College campus in Hanover, New Hampshire. Jim Cole / AP file\n\n\"For well over a decade, female students in Dartmouth's Department of Psychology and Brain Sciences have been treated as sex objects by tenured professors.\"\n\nProfessors were part of an \"alcohol-saturated party culture\" and conducted \"professional lab meetings at bars, invited students to late night 'hot tub parties' in their personal homes and invited undergraduate students to use real cocaine during classes related to addiction as part of a 'demonstration,'\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nKristina Rapuano, a cognitive neuroscience Ph.D. grad, is one of the women suing. She says she was raped by one of her professors in 2015 while attending a conference.\n\n\"I have no memory of that night,\" she told NBC News. \"We had sexual intercourse, which I now believe to be sexual assault,\" she said.\n\nDartmouth trustees are named as defendants, but not the three professors accused of \"Animal House\" behavior. All three of the professors \u2014 Todd Heatherton, William Kelley and Paul Whalen \u2014 have left the school since allegations first surfaced last year.\n\nWhile the lawsuit cites alleged bad behavior going back to 2002, the most of the acts connected to the seven plaintiffs happened between 2015 and 2017.\n\nKelley and Whalen could not be reached for comment on Thursday.\n\nHeatherton, through his lawyer, admitted to at least one instance of drunken behavior and improper touching that were \"accidental\" and a \"poor attempt at humor.\"\n\n\"Professor Heatherton categorically denies playing any role in creating a toxic environment at Dartmouth College,\" according to his lawyer's statement.\n\nThe plaintiffs include two current doctoral Dartmouth students, one former graduate student who left without her degree, three who recently earned their doctorates from the Ivy League school and one who just graduated with her bachelor's degree.\n\nThe \"Animal House\" mention was a reference to the iconic 1978 movie, which glorified a heavy-drinking, over-sexed fraternity.\n\nThe fictional Delta House of Faber College has a loose connection to the famed New Hampshire school. One of the movie's screenwriters, Chris Miller, is a Dartmouth alum and a member of the Alpha Delta fraternity.\n\n\"These professors leered at, groped, sexted, intoxicated and even raped female students,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nNone of the three professors mentioned in the lawsuit have been criminally charged.\n\nDartmouth, in a statement on Thursday, thanked the students for going public with their allegations last year.\n\n\"As a result of the misconduct we found earlier this year by the three PBS faculty members, we took unprecedented steps toward revoking their tenure and terminating their employment,\" according to the school. \"They are no longer at Dartmouth and remain banned from our campus and from attending all Dartmouth-sponsored events, no matter where the events are held.\"\n\nBut the school insisted it did its best to protect students.\n\n\"However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth\u2019s actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings,\" the school statement said.\n\nSasha Brietzke, another of the women suing, told NBC News that \"what Dartmouth did was too little, too late.\"\n\nShe said that Heatherton showed up a social event at a bar in 2016 when she was attending a conference and groped her and put her on his lap, something she described as humiliating. Brietzke said that she participated in an investigation by the school, but felt that not enough had been done.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the conversation hasn't been had. Darthmouth's refused to address our concerns and so we feel that we have to pursue litigation,\u201d Brietzke said. \u201cI'm hoping to inspire change at the institutional level,\u201d she said.\n\nSteven Kelly, a lawyer for the women suing, said that they felt pressured by the professor\u2019s unwanted sexual advances and feared punishment in their careers.\n\n\u201cThese professors had absolute power over these women,\" he said. \"It's absolutely true that these professors had the power to make or break the careers of these women.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Uber is an example of what goes wrong when algorithms become our bosses", "description": "Since its launch less than a decade ago, Uber has created a new model for employment, bringing the Silicon Valley ethos of innovation and experimentation to the workplace.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Alyssa Newcomb\n\nDriverless cars will have a transformative impact on the future, shaking up certain industries and changing the way people live and work. They\u2019re also going to change the way people have sex, according to a new study.\n\nWith the relative privacy of a car, and no need to pay attention to the road, sex on the go will likely be common with the widespread adoption of self-driving vehicles, according to a new paper published in the journal Annals of Tourism Research. The study reviewed papers on self-driving cars and cities to identify future trends around how self-driving cars will reshape the tourism industry.\n\n\u201cThis is something that seems to have stimulated interest,\u201d said Scott Cohen, deputy director of research of the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management at the University of Surrey, who led the study.\n\nAround 60 percent of Americans have already had sex in a car, noted the survey. But with driverless cars, it's more than just couples who might want to sneak in a quickie while on the go. Cohen said autonomous vehicles could become a new venue for sex tourism.\n\n\"Sex is a part of urban tourism and commercialized sex is part of that too, so it is quite likely that autonomous vehicles will lead to prostitution, whether legal or illegal, to take place in moving autonomous vehicles in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nCohen said he predicts sex in autonomous vehicles likely won\u2019t become a reality until \u201cthe 2040s.\u201d In places where prostitution is legal and where regulations support the advancement of technology, \u201cthose two strands will come together,\u201d putting sex tourism on wheels.\n\nSex tourism was just a small part of the paper, which doesn\u2019t address the additional questions that will need to be answered about safety and sex tourism. As autonomous vehicles become a mainstream reality in the future, it\u2019s also likely they\u2019ll be designed for a range of activities from sex to sleeping and dining.\n\n\u201cHotels will be affected in the future, particularly roadside motels,\u201d since people will just sleep in their cars as they travel, Cohen said. He added that people may be more likely to choose a less expensive hotel outside of a city center, since they can rely on their self-driving car to get them where they need to be, with little effort.\n\nThere will be job losses in industries linked to transit, including taxis and hop-on, hop-off bus tours, Cohen said. Even restaurants may get burned. Dining pods in self-driving vehicles could replace some restaurants, he said, allowing tourists to go on dining excursions.\n\nSex, technology, and privacy have always been closely intertwined, said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina.\n\nHowever, by the 2040s, when the majority of time Americans spend on the road will be in driverless vehicles, people might simply \"be too engrossed in virtual reality sex to care about what's in the car,\" said Smith."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Ben Collins, Michael Cappetta", "title": "Facebook announces content oversight board as Zuckerberg responds to lobbying crisis", "description": "Facebook announced on Thursday that it will create an independent governing body to moderate content on the platform, marking a significant change in how the company handles editorial decisions.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-announces-content-oversight-board-zuckerberg-responds-lobbying-crisis-n936806", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/2618041/181025-mark-zuckerberg-mc-952_f54ea235274e93acd0fb0444c84cc996.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:40:59Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It is not clear if the governing body would be comprised of volunteers or paid employees.\n\nZuckerberg announced the governing body in a phone call that quickly turned away from the company\u2019s announcement and toward a lengthy report from The New York Times that revealed the company paid Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research firm, to discredit Facebook opponents \u2014 including linking a group to liberal philanthropist George Soros.\n\nDuring the call with reporters, Zuckerberg weathered a barrage of questions about the company\u2019s role in the lobbying campaign against activist groups.

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and three others wrote.\n\nZuckerberg said an internal probe on the Definers controversy will be headed up by Facebook's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, the former U.K. deputy prime minister who recently joined the company.\n\nFacebook also released an \u201cenforcement report\u201d on Thursday outlining the amount of content and number of accounts pulled down for content violations. Some reporters on the call remarked on what appeared to be a lack of enforcement of what was considered \u201cbullying\u201d \u2014 about 2.1 million incidents from July to September \u2014 since Facebook announced its new anti-bullying rules in March.\n\nBy contrast, Facebook took action on 754 million fake accounts \u2014 with the company taking action on 99.6 percent of all cases before being notified by users, the company said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Suzanne Gamboa", "title": "Latinos show record gains in Congress, though numbers are still low", "description": "The 2018 midterms ushered a record number of Latinos headed to Congress, though their numbers fall far short of matching the nearly 18 percent share of Hispanics in the U.S.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latinos-show-record-gains-congress-though-numbers-are-still-low-n936781", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2635806/181106-capitol-mn-1715_e40f18c494984158867e906dce913a96.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:26:00Z", "content": "Nov. 15, 2018 / 8:26 PM GMT AUSTIN, Texas Although the new Congress will have a record number of Latino members, their numbers will fall far short of matching the share of the U.S. population that is Hispanic.

If the share of Latinos in the 435-member House matched the share in the population, about 77 House members would be Hispanic. In the 100-member Senate, there would be about 18 Latino senators.\n\n\"The 2018 elections clearly showed progress for increased Latino representation at all levels of government,\" said Arturo Vargas, NALEO executive director, who was in Washington overseeing a new Latino congressional member orientation. \"And it's a long-term process to reach the point where the government reflects its people, and it hasn't achieved that yet in regard to Latinos.\"\n\nAll of the new Latino faces will be in the House, with two more possible. California still was counting votes Thursday afternoon, and the race between Democrat Gil Cisneros and Republican Young Kim for California House District 50 was tied.\n\nAnd Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat from New Mexico, had pushed ahead of Republican Yvette Herrell after additional vote counting, but Herrell had not conceded by Thursday afternoon.\n\nLatinos are the nation\u2019s largest minority group in the country and the population should register even larger in the 2020 census.\n\nThere are nine new African-American members of Congress, including Antonio Delgado, a New York Democrat, who also is Puerto Rican and counted among the new Latino members as well.\n\nThat pushes the total black congressional members, including senators, to at least 55, possibly more depending on the pending outcome of two other races. African-Americans are 12 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nHeading into the midterms, 27 of the Latinos in Congress were Democrats and seven were Republican. Democrats had a net gain of five Latinos while Republicans had a net loss of two, totaling 32 Latino Democrats and five Republicans in the House in 2019.\n\nFlorida lost two Republican Latinos, Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring at the end of the year and Carlos Curbelo, who lost his race to Debbie Murcasel-Powell, a Latina of Ecuadoran descent.\n\nIn Idaho lost Rep. Raul Labrador, a Republican, who ran for governor and lost in the primary.\n\nThe Democrats lost a Latino in Nevada, Rep. Ruben Kihuen, who chose not to run for re-election after facing sexual harassment allegations.\n\nBut Democrats gained two more Latinos in New York, Delgado and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 who is the youngest member ever elected to the House \u2014 and two Latinas in Texas, Veronica Escobar and Sylvia Garcia, who are the first Latinas elected to represent Texas in the House.\n\nCalifornia added another Latino to its House delegation after Mike Levin, who is Mexican-American, won his race in California.\n\nRepublicans made history with the election of Republican Anthony Gonzalez, who is of Cuban descent and the first Hispanic elected to Congress from Ohio.\n\nThe other new face is Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia of Illinois, who is taking over for Rep. Luis Gutierrez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and is retiring. Garcia is the first Mexican-American to represent Illinois in Congress.\n\nAlthough no new Latinos were added to the Senate, a Latina will oversee their efforts to expand the Democratic presence in the chamber.\n\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., named Sen.

Latino Democrats will hold 11 statewide offices, up from six. The number of Latino Republicans holding statewide office will decline from seven to three.\n\nThe newest Latino statewide officeholders will be New Mexico Democrats Michelle Lujan Grisham, governor; Howie Morales, lieutenant governor; Brian Col\u00f3n, state auditor; and Stephanie Garcia Richard, commissioner of public lands. From California, Democrat Ricardo Lara was elected insurance commissioner, and Florida's first Latina lieutenant governor will be Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, a Republican.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pittsburgh woman's car damaged in SpaghettiOs assault", "description": "Police are investigating an assault involving several cans of SpaghettiOs in Pittsburgh.

Vitiello said ICE employees are threatened with violence or targeted at their homes.\n\n\"They should not have to bear the burden of attacks motivated largely by political and policy disagreements,\" he said.\n\nBut Vitiello was questioned by Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., about a tweet Vitiello sent from a personal account in 2015. It was in reply to a message to conservative talk show host Mark Levin asking for new names for the Democratic party. Vitiello responded: \"liberalcratic party or the NeoKlanist party.\"\n\nHe told senators it was wrong to send it, though he added he thought he was sending a direct message, not a public tweet.\n\n\"It's important and I understand the gravity, it was meant as a joke I wasn't trying to do anything other than make a joke. I regret it,\" he said.\n\nVitiello has been a law enforcement agent for more than 30 years, starting in 1985 with the U.S. Border Patrol. He was previously Border Patrol chief and deputy commissioner U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the patrol. Letters of support from police, lawmakers and career law enforcement officers spoke of Vitiello's professionalism and dedication, including one from Gil Kerlikowske, the former commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection under President Barack Obama.\n\nPart of ICE's mission is to make arrests of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, which has made it a symbol of President Donald Trump's hardline policies. Trump did away with an Obama-era policy prioritizing dangerous criminals for removal. ICE officials say they still have the same priorities \u2014 arrests of migrants with a criminal history rose 50 percent during the 2018 budget year, and some 900,000 pounds of narcotics were seized. Vitiello said the agency arrested 11,000 known or suspected gang members and removed 6,000 from the country.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who has said the government \"maybe\" should \"start from scratch\" on an immigration enforcement agency, questioned Vitiello on the perception of ICE that it uses arrests to cause fear and intimidation among immigrants, particularly those from Mexico and Central America. Harris has stopped short of saying ICE should be abolished.\n\nVitiello said the agency is enforcing the law and officers do the best they can.\n\nSen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., asked whether Vitiello would help tone down harsh words coming out of the White House on immigration and immigrants. He invoked the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four black girls. The deadly act was a direct result of racist inflammatory words by Alabama lawmakers and law enforcement, said Jones, who as a federal attorney, prosecuted in the early 2000s two of the four Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the bombing.\n\n\"Words have consequences, especially considering comments you acknowledged you were inappropriate,\" he said. \"I want to make sure you will stand up and do the right thing.\"\n\n\"I'm committed,\" Vitiello said.\n\nThe committee was expected to vote on his nomination after Thanksgiving."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Amanda Lucidon", "title": "I was Michelle Obama's White House photographer.

Four years had gone by as quickly as the motorcade that I had become accustomed to riding in as one of the official White House photographers assigned to document First Lady Michelle Obama. Twenty countries, countless cities and so many lessons learned.\n\nEveryone wondered, although few people asked out loud, what I would do next. I could read the question in their eyes.\n\nThe truth was, I had no idea what my next move would be. There hadn\u2019t been time to think about it. As a White House photographer, it had been my responsibility to document the Obama administration for history \u2014 I had to be focused and completely present.\n\nThrough the lens of my camera, I learned so much from Michelle Obama. Her dedication to education and providing opportunities for those who need it most truly inspired me.\n\nAnd yet, through the lens of my camera, I learned so much from Michelle Obama. Her dedication to education and providing opportunities for those who need it most truly inspired me. She taught me so many important life lessons that shifted my perspective and strengthened my courage and confidence. As a new mother, I recognized that the lessons I learned through these experiences would be passed down to my own child. Ultimately, I left the White House energized and motivated to help lift others up through arts and education.\n\nOne particularly inspirational example was the first lady\u2019s trip to Liberia. It was very special to travel with Obama to highlight the importance of education for girls around the world, an initiative that was close to her heart. For nearly an hour, we trekked through rugged terrain and flooded dirt roads, as I ate another ginger candy to calm the morning sickness of early pregnancy. I focused on making photos of the joyful people that lined the road in celebration of the first lady\u2019s visit to their war-torn county.\n\nWhen we arrived at the R.S. Caulfield Senior High School in Unification Town, we were greeted by the angelic voices of girls singing a welcome song \u2014 with pouring rain as the percussion. In a classroom without electricity and very few books, the girls shared their stories of overcoming adversity and their dedication to getting an education. Obama and her staff (myself included) were incredibly moved by their strength, courage and determination. As I stood watching, I thought about my unborn daughter and was grateful for Obama\u2019s devotion to this issue.\n\nAt home, Obama made it her mission to open the doors of the White House to as many people as possible, especially young people. She felt strongly about providing children with access to the arts and humanities. Several times a year the White House hosted arts workshops led by the top professionals in the business. One of my favorite events to photograph was the Turnaround Arts Talent Show.\n\nTurnaround Arts, a program created under Obama\u2019s leadership, works in dozens of low-performing schools throughout the country. The integration of high-quality arts education strengthens school reform efforts, boosts academic achievement and increases student engagement in schools facing myriad tough challenges.\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama snuggles against President Barack Obama before a videotaping for the 2015 World Expo, in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, March 27, 2015. Amanda Lucidon / The White House\n\nThe Turnaround Arts talent show was designed to highlight school and student efforts. I was in tears behind my camera as I documented the event. It felt like I was watching flowers slowly bloom. The children were nervous to get on stage in front of the first lady and her guests. But as they performed, their flickers of confidence grew into an effulgent light. I felt a special connection to these kids. As a child who grew up on welfare with limited opportunities, I never would have imagined that I\u2019d be working at the White House. The arts made it possible.\n\nIndeed, possibility was a major theme of the White House. Obama said countless times that we should never be afraid to fail. She reminded us that failure is an important part of growth. And encouraged us to try new things. To push past our comfort zone. And she reminded us that if we fall, it\u2019s okay \u2014 just get back up. I hear her voice in my head every time I am confronted with a challenge that scares me. And I know there\u2019s only one option: forward.\n\nAmanda Lucidon is the author of \"Reach Higher\" and \"Chasing Light.\" Alan Spearman\n\nBut the most important lesson I learned from Obama was about perspective. She encouraged us to look at the challenges that we\u2019ve faced in life as strengths and not weaknesses. These are defining moments that have built our character and resilience. And with resilience, it\u2019s possible to overcome anything.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve worked hard and done well and walked through that door of opportunity, you do not slam it shut behind you. Instead, you reach back and give other folks the same chances that helped you succeed. Both Barack and Michelle Obama repeated this principle countless times to audiences around the world. Sometimes the words changed slightly but the message was always the same.\n\nTheir words challenged me to think deeply about my path to the White House. What opened those gates for me? I can say unequivocally that the arts changed my life, gave me hope and allowed me to dream. And it\u2019s important for me to share that gift with others.\n\nPenguin Random House\n\nSince leaving the White House, I have continued to work with the Turnaround Arts program, now run by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. As a Turnaround Artist, I visit schools across the country to share my passion for photography and storytelling. And I\u2019ve witnessed the transformative power of the arts on students, teachers and schools.\n\nBringing the arts into underserved communities is a priority for me and this mission is constantly evolving. I\u2019m currently working on a pilot arts program with a team of artists and mindfulness practitioners in Memphis, Tennessee. Our program \u201cBe What A Bullet Can\u2019t Be\u201d brings arts and mindfulness practices into juvenile detention centers to help reduce youth violence.\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t get to see the Obama\u2019s as often as I used to, their influence has stayed with me, guiding my most important decisions. Any time I\u2019m confronted with a difficult choice, my husband will calmly ask, \u201cWhat would POTUS and FLOTUS do?\u201d And while I don\u2019t always know what is ahead of me, they\u2019ve given me the confidence to take that next step."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Julie Compton", "title": "Frazzled?

But according to productivity experts John Zeratsky and Jake Knapp, it doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\nThe co-authors say their new book \u201cMake Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day\u201d outlines how we can overcome the many obstacles that prevent us from doing the things we really need to focus on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about concrete ways to rethink some of the default behaviors that have crept into 21st century life that have to do with our smart phones and our calendars and our corporate cultures that leave us with this feeling that time is sort of slipping away from us,\u201d Zeratsky tells NBC News BETTER.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest themes of the book is that there\u2019s a default in our culture, in our work culture, and our every day society of guilt,\u201d adds Knapp \u201c\u2026 a lot of the tools that are out there are just designed to nag us \u2014 to make us feel more guilty.\u201d\n\nJohn Zeratsky and Jake Knapp, authors of \"Make Time\" Courtesy John Zeratsky and Jake Knapp\n\nThe old coworkers used to work at GV, formerly Google Ventures. There, the men contrived a number of techniques to help startup companies be more productive, which they outlined in their first book \u201cSprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test Ideas in Just Five Days.\u201d\n\nThe duo say \u201cMake Time\u201d applies a lot of the same tactics for individuals. They say the book outlines four basic steps that, if repeated every day, can boost your productivity dramatically over time.\n\nSTEP 1: THE HIGHLIGHT\n\nThe first step is the most important, according to the authors. Each morning, figure out what you want to be the highlight of your day.\n\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s just one thing, even if it\u2019s something I\u2019m doing already, what is the one thing I should have my peek attention on?\u201d asks Zeratsky.\n\nEverything else in your day is secondary to the highlight, Zeratsky says, which may require you to \u201cbulldoze,\u201d or clear your calendar so you can focus on that one thing.\n\n\u201cIt has a powerful effect on what happens for folks,\u201d Knapp says, \u201cand it\u2019s a nice, simple way to reframe everything, and it is kind of the heart of how \u2018Make Time\u2019 works.\u201d\n\nSTEP #2: LASER\n\nNow that you know what your highlight is, you need to be able to focus on it distraction free.\n\n\u201cThe next thing after achieving that highlight, is the moment when you\u2019re in it \u2014 that\u2019s Laser,\u201d says Zeratsky. \u201cYou want your attention to be laser-focused.\u201d\n\nDepending on what works best for you, this step could include eliminating or logging out of distracting apps on your phone, or turning off the news.\n\nWhat matters is that you are excited about whatever you\u2019re working on, says Knapp.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s actually the biggest difference from the other ways we\u2019ve heard people talk about time management or attention management,\u201d he says, \u201cis this idea of really being excited, and bringing joy and enthusiasm to that moment.\u201d\n\nJohn Zeratsky and Jake Knapp's four-step plan to prioritize what's most important John Zeratsky and Jake Knapp\n\nSTEP #3: ENERGIZE\n\nEnergy is \u201cthe battery pack that makes everything else run,\u201d so it\u2019s important to take care of your physical health, the authors say. Be sure to make time to exercise and eat well so your energy stays elevated throughout the day, says Knapp.\n\n\u201cWe just think it\u2019s important to also keep in mind that the body is whole thing, it\u2019s not just the brain,\u201d he says."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Brooke Sopelsa", "title": "Former Cowboys linebacker comes out as gay, announces wedding", "description": "Jeff Rohrer, who played in the NFL from 1982 to 1987, will marry Joshua Ross this weekend.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/former-cowboys-linebacker-comes-out-gay-announces-wedding-n936751", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2647806/181115-jeff-rohrer-al-1251_e98cbbb292c6c76deb2e9d59f93a91ca.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:53:00Z", "content": "Nov. 15, 2018 / 6:53 PM GMT Jeff Rohrer, a former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, came out as gay Wednesday in an interview in The New York Times.

At one point the winemakers were worried about how the smoke from last year's Northern California wildfires could affect the grapes. The 2017 fire burned over 340,000 acres of land, killed at least 44 people, and cost the wine industry $13.2 billion.\n\nLatina viticulturist Vanessa Robledo's ancestors migrated to the U.S. in the 1940s.\n\n\u201cTheir resume was the calluses on their hands,\u201d Robledo told NBC News in a phone interview, describing the way her great-grandfather and grandfather were picked for the Bracero program, a temporary worker agreement signed between the United States and Mexico during World War II, when the U.S. had a shortage of workers, that brought millions of Mexican workers and field hands to the U.S.\n\nThe term bracero has Spanish language roots, and was commonly used to describe manual laborers or people who worked with their brazos (arms).\n\n\u201cThey had to take off their clothes [to be examined], and depending on the muscle mass on their bodies they were selected as laborers,\u201d said Robledo.\n\nIn the documentary, Robledo recalls her father saying, \"Being able to farm, that's how our family is going to be able to survive, and that is our future.\"\n\nFor Robledo, the way her ancestors pruned and grafted vines is a very personal experience that shaped and formed the clusters of grapes that made her family\u2019s American Dream come true.\n\nThe documentary shows viewers today how California vineyards are still fueling the dreams of younger migrants\u2014harvesters like Ren\u00e9 Reyes, who sees in the vines a path and opportunity to prune and graft a better future for his children.\n\nReyes migrates seasonally from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico to California with the same H-2A visa that President Trump\u2019s winery uses in Charlottesville, Virginia to hire temporary agricultural workers. The H-2A program is a modern-day version of the older Bracero program.\n\nReyes, like other Mexican workers, was recruited by a mayordomo (steward) at a California vineyard. While Mexico does not have a big wine making tradition like Spain, Italy or France, Mexican workers have specific grafting, pruning and budding skills that were developed over generations of farming limes, avocado, corn and beans, and they've been working in California vineyards for many generations.\n\nGuest worker H-2A visas surged in 2018\u2014200,363 workers were requested during the first three quarters of this fiscal year. Many of those visas are requested by the wine industry\u2014and other agricultural industries\u2014which face a shortage of skilled labor.\n\n\"Meaning and purpose\"\n\nWine makers like Robledo have had a long trajectory in the wine industry. She helped grow the family winery from 100 to 20,000 cases in one decade, and broke out as an independent wine consultant for high-end wineries like Black Coyote. She then teamed up again with her mother on their own vineyards.\n\n\u201cI am very thankful of the way that I grew up with my ancestors, because they explained to me that doing the work is not just doing the work,\u201d she told NBC News.\n\n\u201cThere is a passion and connection that they had with the land, an understanding that goes beyond anything that has to do with labor and money,\" Robledo adds. \"There is a spiritual understanding and love for the land that gives us meaning and purpose.\u201d\n\n\"Harvest Season,\" which is being screened in New York City's Independent Film Center (IFC) on November 15, will also premiere on PBS in the spring of 2019.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Elisha Fieldstadt", "title": "'Watcher' house family says neighbors made nightmare worse", "description": "Derek Broaddus, who says his family was harassed by letters from a \"watcher\" after buying a Westfield, New Jersey, house said he's also sent some letters.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/owner-n-j-watcher-house-admits-he-sent-some-menacing-n936661", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/1476886/160329-westfield-house-mdl_d7ff5c09ce3cabbe001fe5c4e3152f9f.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:33:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

I have just the couple in mind!,\u201d one neighbor wrote on Facebook while Derek and Maria Broaddus were trying to figure out what to do with their recently-purchased $1.35 million home after receiving letters from someone calling him or herself \u201cThe Watcher.\u201d\n\nThe first letter arrived at the six-bedroom colonial at 657 Boulevard in June 2014 before the Broadduses had the chance to move in with their three kids.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched in the 1960s. It is now my time. Do you know the history of the house? Do you know what lies within the walls of 657 Boulevard?,\u201d the letter read. \u201cDo you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested? Better for me.\u201d\n\nThe family was spooked. Derek Broaddus reported the letter, which had no return address, to the Westfield police. Investigators told the Broadduses not to mention the letter to neighbors, as they were all suspects.\n\nBut as rumors and media stories brought attention to the letters, some residents of Westfield \u2014 a New York suburb with an average household income of about $200,000 a year \u2014 began to vilify the Broadduses.\n\nSome were offended that police had approached them as suspects, according to New York magazine.\n\nOthers were reportedly angry that they only learned about the letters from a lawsuit the Broadduses filed against the previous owners of the home. The suit claimed the prior owners should have disclosed an anonymous letter they received before closing on the sale. It was eventually dismissed.\n\nSome other Westfield residents suspected the Broadduses may have been sending the notes themselves as part of some twisted real estate scheme or buyers\u2019 remorse, the magazine reported.\n\nBroaddus has a different theory about the reaction of some of his neighbors.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to my family is an affront to their contention that they\u2019re safe, that there\u2019s no such thing as mental illness in their community. People don\u2019t want to believe this could happen in Westfield,\u201d he told New York magazine.\n\nThree years after buying the house, Broaddus sent some letters of his own to neighbors who had been especially critical of him and his wife, he admitted to the magazine.\n\nPeople who received his letters said they referenced recent acts of domestic terrorism that had stemmed from mental illnesses gone unchecked. The notes were signed \u201cFriends of the Broaddus Family.\u201d\n\nBroaddus said they were the only anonymous letters he sent, and that he hadn't told his wife.\n\nHe wrote the letters shortly after town officials stood in the way of a plan the Broadduses came up with as a last resort. They applied to tear the house down and build two houses in its place.\n\nThe town's planning board unanimously rejected the proposal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Broadduses had become consumed with finding the author themselves. Over the years, they have had two former FBI agents, a private investigator, a security firm CEO and a forensic linguist on the case, according to New York magazine.\n\nNo one, including the local police, could figure out where the letters were coming from.\n\nSix months after they closed on the house, the Broadduses initial solution was to sell the home that they had never lived in.\n\nA deciding factor was one of the \"The Watcher\" letters which referred to the Broaddus children\u2019s nicknames. It said, \u201cWho has the bedrooms facing the street? I\u2019ll know as soon as you move in. It will help me to know who is in which bedroom. Then I can plan better.\u201d\n\nIn their first efforts to sell the house, the Broadduses felt compelled to disclose the letters to potential buyers, which made the value of the home plummet. They took it off the market.\n\nIn 2016, the Broadduses put the house on the market again at a severely reduced price. But no one would buy the home even at discount.\n\nThe Broadduses still own 657 Boulevard, but rent it out for less than their mortgage payment.\n\nThe first renters got the fourth and latest letter, Derek Broaddus told New York magazine. \u201cLoved ones suddenly die,\u201d it said. \u201cYou are despised by the house.

Logan Melgar.\n\nThe U.S. Navy brought the charges against the four service members on Tuesday, painting a gruesome picture of the effort to kill Melgar, 34.\n\nThe suspects are accused of driving to Marine quarters to obtain duct tape, breaking into Melgar's room while he was sleeping, restraining him with the duct tape, and strangling him in a chokehold. The four U.S. service members, which include two members of the famed SEAL Team Six, killed Melgar \"while perpetrating a burglary,\" according to their charge sheets.\n\nMelgar was killed in Bamako, Mali, where U.S. forces were working with local military to counter the local Al Qaeda affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The charges were first reported by The Daily Beast.\n\nMelgar died in the embassy housing he shared with other service members.\n\nIn addition to felony murder, the charges against the four men include conspiracy, obstruction of justice, hazing and burglary.\n\nLogan J. Melgar U.S. Army\n\nA spokesperson for U.S. Special Operations Command said these charges do not reflect the conduct of U.S. Special Operators all over the world.\n\n\"We will not allow allegations or substantiated incidents of misconduct erode decades of honorable accomplishments by the members of US Special Operations Command,\" Captain Jason Salata said. \"If these allegations of misconduct are substantiated, they represent a violation of the trust and standards required of all service members.\"\n\n\"We hold ourselves and each other accountable on a daily basis because we know that lives are on the line.\"\n\nThe names of the two Navy SEALS are redacted from the charge sheets, but a September 2017 Army Criminal Investigative Division report about the incident quotes Navy SEAL Tony DeDolph saying he and Army Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar were wrestling at 4 a.m. when a fellow SEAL Adam Cranston Matthew came in and joined in the horseplay. According to the SEALS, the men fell down together and when they stood up, Melgar wasn't breathing.\n\nThe SEALs say they attempted CPR and tried to open an airway, but Melgar died of asphyxiation.\n\nThe identities of the Marine Raiders are still not public, but their tie to the Raiders was first reported by NBC News."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "May on Brexit: \u2018Am I going to see this through?

He was 85.\n\nPublicist Jeremy Westby said Clark died Thursday due to complications from pneumonia at home in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nClark was \"Hee Haw\" host or co-host for its entire 24-year run, with Buck Owens his best known co-host. The country music and comedy show's last episode aired in 1993, though reruns continued for a few years thereafter.\n\n\"'Hee Haw' won't go away. It brings a smile to too many faces,\" he said in 2004, when the show was distributed on VHS and DVD for the first time.\n\nClark played the guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, harmonica and other instruments. His skills brought him gigs as guest performer with many top orchestras, including the Boston Pops. In 1976 he headlined a tour of the Soviet Union, breaking boundaries that were usually closed to Americans.\n\nAnd of course, he also was a member of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nHis hits included \"The Tips of My Fingers\" (1963), \"Yesterday When I Was Young\" (1969), \"Come Live With Me\" (1973) and \"Honeymoon Feeling\" (1974). He was also known for his instrumental versions of \"Malaguena,\" on 12-string guitar, and \"Ghost Riders in the Sky.\"\n\nHe was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2009, and emotionally told the crowd how moving it was \"just to be associated yourself with the members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and imagine that your name will be said right along with all the list.\"\n\nIn his 1994 autobiography, \"My Life in Spite of Myself,\" he said \"Yesterday, When I Was Young\" had \"opened a lot of people's eyes not only to what I could do but to the whole fertile and still largely untapped field of country music, from the Glen Campbells and the Kenny Rogerses, right on through to the Garth Brookses and Vince Gills.\"\n\nClark was guest host on \"The Tonight Show\" several times in the 1960s and 1970s when it was rare for a country performer to land such a role. His fans included not just musicians, but baseball great Mickey Mantle. The Yankees outfielder was moved to tears by \"Yesterday When I Was Young\" and for years made Clark promise to sing it at his memorial \u2014 a request granted after Mantle died in 1995.\n\nBeginning in 1983, Clark operated the Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre in Branson, Missouri, and was one of the first country entertainers to open a theater there. Dozens followed him.\n\nHe was a touring artist as late as the 2000s. Over the years, he played at venues around the world: Carnegie Hall in New York, the Sporting Club in Monte Carlo, the Grand Palace in Brussels and the Rossiya Theatre in Moscow.\n\nClark was born in Meherrin, Virginia, and received his first guitar on his 14th Christmas. He was playing in his father's square dance band at age 15.\n\nIn the 1950s, Clark played in bands in the Washington, D.C., area. In 1960, he got the chance to front the band of country singer Wanda Jackson. He also performed regularly in Las Vegas. He got his first recording contract, with Capitol Records, in 1962.\n\nHe appeared on Jimmy Dean's TV show \"Town and Country Time\" and took over the show when Dean left.\n\nIn 1997 he released \"Roy Clark's Christmas Memories.\"\n\nClark and Owens worked together for years, but they had very different feelings about \"Hee Haw.\" Owens, who left the show in 1986, later referred to it as a \"cartoon donkey,\" one he endured for \"that big paycheck.\" Clark told The Associated Press in 2004 that \"Hee Haw\" was like a family reunion.\n\n\"We became a part of the family. The viewers were sort of part owners of the show. They identified with these clowns, and we had good music.\"\n\nClark said the hour-long program of country music and corny jokes capped off his career.\n\n\"This was the icing on the cake.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Michael Cappetta, Ben Collins and Jo Ling Kent\n\nThe conservative lobbying firm that Facebook hired in the midst of an October 2017 public relations crisis about Russian disinformation included what one former employee told NBC News was an \u201cin-house fake news shop\u201d as part of its operations.\n\nFacebook\u2019s ties to the lobbying firm, Definers Public Affairs, were first reported on Wednesday in The New York Times, which detailed how the group aimed to \u201cdiscredit activist protesters [of Facebook], in part by linking them to liberal financier George Soros,\u201d who has become the subject of widespread right-wing conspiracy theories for his philanthropy work.\n\nThe report resulted in widespread criticism and accusations of hypocrisy by Facebook for its use of a lobbying firm that pushed narratives on behalf of its clients disguised as news articles. And some of the firm\u2019s more inflammatory political ads for other clients were removed by Facebook itself for violating its advertising policies.\n\nDefiners runs a website called NTK Network, which has a verified page on Facebook with more than 120,000 followers that publishes and promotes articles about the firm\u2019s clients as well as their competitors.\n\nA former employee of Definers, who asked not to be identified in order to protect professional relationships, told NBC News that NTK Network was \u201cour in-house fake news shop.\u201d Some clients would actively pay for NTK Network\u2019s positive coverage, which the ex-employee said would then be pushed out through Facebook in the hopes of being picked up by larger conservative media outlets such as Breitbart.\n\nOne article currently being promoted on Facebook through NTK Network\u2019s page promotes the page as having \u201cthe latest stories without the liberal bias,\u201d according to Facebook\u2019s publicly available ad index.\n\nThe former employee told NBC News the company would run positive stories about clients \u201cat the end of the day\u201d simply to \u201cfill up space\u201d on NTK Network\u2019s website and feed, even if they didn\u2019t specifically pay for NTK\u2019s suite of services through Definers.\n\nA NTK Network ad on Facebook. Facebook\n\nNTK is currently running an ad to promote a story published on Tuesday headlined \u201cConservatives Blast ITC Judge\u2019s Ruling on Apple,\u201d which refers to a patent dispute between Apple and Qualcomm. The former employee claimed Qualcomm had a relationship with Definers.\n\nQualcomm and Apple declined to comment.\n\nThe revelation highlights how public relations firms like Definers have been able to move beyond efforts to seed stories in the press on behalf of their clients and can now promote their own articles on Facebook in the guise of news, just as Russia promoted misinformation and divisive political rhetoric through disguised media publications. And now it turns out that Facebook was not just the platform for this kind of opposition work, but had actually hired a practitioner to do so on its behalf.\n\n\u201cAfter a year of increasingly worrying revelations about the scourge of misinformation on Facebook, it is still shocking to learn that Facebook itself employed the same tactics that bad actors have used to exploit its platform,\u201d Justin Hendrix, executive director at NYC Media Lab, a university consortium focused on media technology, said.\n\n\u201cHow can we ever trust this company?\u201d Hendrix said. \u201cIt is apparently more willing to use misinformation tactics than to seriously police them.\u201d\n\nNTK Network declined to comment.\n\nThe ex-employee said that Facebook hired the firm to research opponents of Facebook following its problems with Russian disinformation. A current employee at Definers, who asked not to be named as they are not authorized to speak on behalf of the company, confirmed that Facebook began its working relationship with the firm in October of 2017.\n\nWithin the first month of their working relationship, positive coverage of Facebook on NTK Network\u2019s site was already up and running. On Oct. 31, one NTK headline stated: \u201cRussian Content on Facebook Amounted to Just .004% of Total Content.\u201d The article echoes statements delivered to Congress by Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch, who appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in October 2017 to talk about Facebook\u2019s role in the Russian disinformation crisis before the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nThe site\u2019s positive coverage of Facebook, with no discernible negative content, continued for months, including a story headlined: \u201cFacebook VP: Russian Goal Was to Divide, Not to Swing Election.\u201d\n\nLast month, while the social media giant was still working with Definers, Facebook removed some of NTK Network\u2019s political ads for violating Facebook\u2019s advertising policies, including one with the headline: \u201cAre These Liberal Billionaires the Biggest Threat to Americans\u2019 Second Amendment Rights?\u201d\n\nOther NTK Network ads attacking Democrats from earlier in 2018 were removed for \u201crunning without a \u2018Paid For By\u2019 label,\u201d according to Facebook\u2019s ad database.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg appears before a Senate hearing about privacy and election meddling on Capitol Hill on April 11, 2018. David Butow / for NBC News file\n\nPatrick Gaspard, president of the Open Society Foundations, the nonprofit group funded by Soros, called for Facebook to explain its actions.\n\n\u201cYour methods threaten the very values underpinning our democracy,\u201d Gaspard wrote in a letter addressed to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cI would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter with you in person, and to hear what steps you might take to help remediate the damage done by this deeply misguided \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 effort carried out at Facebook\u2019s behest.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about NTK\u2019s working relationship with the social media company, Facebook directed NBC News to a company blog posted late Wednesday night, saying it had ended its relationship with the consulting firm.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook\u2019s behalf \u2014 or to spread misinformation,\u201d Facebook wrote in its statement.\n\n\u201cDefiners did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of \u2018Freedom from Facebook,\u2019 an anti-Facebook organization,\u201d the company statement said. \u201cThe intention was to demonstrate that it was not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign, as it claimed, but supported by a well-known critic of our company.

A mathematical point has zero length. Those zeroes might be unfamiliar, but they follow a consistent logic. All represent the absence of a certain quality: mass, electric charge, distance.\n\nThen there is the puzzling case of absolute zero.\n\nWe tend to think of hot and cold as relative things. A cup of hour-old tea, for example, is colder than the fire on your stove but hotter than an ice cube. Absolute zero represents the coldest possible temperature, which defies the this-versus-that pattern.\n\nStranger still, absolute zero isn\u2019t even zero on the temperature scales used by nonscientists. It\u2019s minus 273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale, or minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nHow can there be a lowest temperature?\n\nThe key to decoding absolute zero is understanding what temperature is. It\u2019s simply a measure of how fast the atoms or molecules within a substance are moving \u2014 or, to be more precise, the average kinetic energy of those particles.\n\nThink of it as a game of atomic dodgeball. When the ball hits you, you feel its energy. Trillions and trillions of those dodgeball hits, happening on an invisibly small scale, are what we perceive as temperature.\n\nFast-moving atoms hit hard, which we feel as a high temperature. When a hot object touches a cold object, the faster, hotter atoms impart some of their velocity to the slower, colder ones. The hot object cools. The cool object grows warmer.\n\nNow the zero in absolute zero makes sense: Absolute zero is the temperature at which the particles in a substance are essentially motionless. There\u2019s no way to slow them down further, so there can be no lower temperature.\n\nDoes everything stop moving at absolute zero? Not quite. Atoms aren\u2019t entirely still; they wobble as a result of effects related to quantum physics. And, of course, the activity within each atom continues no matter how cold it gets. Electrons keep moving, as do protons and neutrons.\n\nWho discovered absolute zero?\n\nGuillaume Amontons, a French inventor who lost his hearing in childhood and never went to college, figured out the basic concept in 1702. His experiments showed that air pressure is proportional to temperature, and he deduced that there was a minimum temperature at which pressure would drop to nothing. He even made an estimate of that temperature, minus 240 degrees C \u2014 remarkably close to the actual value.\n\nIn 1848, the Scottish-Irish physicist William Thomson, better known as Lord Kelvin, extended Amontons\u2019 work, developing what he called an \u201cabsolute\u201d temperature scale that would apply to all substances. He set absolute zero as 0 on his scale, getting rid of the unwieldy negative numbers. Physicists now rely on the Kelvin (K) scale for temperature measurements.\n\nWhere is the coldest place in the universe?\n\nThe energy left over from the Big Bang warms the whole universe, keeping it well above absolute zero. The average temperature of space is 2.74 Kelvin, or minus 454.7 degrees F.\n\nSurprisingly, some celestial objects are colder than empty space. An expanding cloud of gas called the Boomerang Nebula behaves like an interstellar refrigerator. With a temperature of about 1 K, it\u2019s the coldest naturally occurring location in the cosmos.\n\nBut humans have gone colder than that right here on Earth. In 2003, researchers at MIT used laser beams to slow sodium atoms, cooling them to one-half of a billionth of a degree above absolute zero. That\u2019s still the world record.\n\nThe coldest place beyond Earth is artificial, too. Last summer, astronauts activated an experiment called the Cold Atom Lab aboard the International Space Station. The lab has attained temperatures 30 million times lower than empty space. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on this idea, off and on, for over 20 years,\u201d says Robert Thompson of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab, one of the researchers who devised the experiment. \u201cIt feels incredible to witness it up and operating.\u201d\n\nWhat happens when matter gets that cold?\n\nIf Thompson sounds excited, it\u2019s because ultra-cold atoms behave in fascinating and potentially useful ways. For one thing, they lose their individual identities, fusing to form a bizarre state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.\n\n\u201cWe have folks aiming to use condensates to do practical things like improving satellite navigation, while others are trying to test fundamental theories of physics or to simulate the physics of the early universe,\u201d Thompson says.\n\nClose to absolute zero, it\u2019s also possible to manipulate chemical reactions in ways that are impossible under other conditions.\n\nLast spring, Harvard chemist Kang-Kuen Ni assembled a molecule directly from two low-temperature, slow-moving atoms, making it the smallest chemistry experiment ever conducted. Under such conditions, the subtle effects of quantum physics become plain to see. \u201cAt these ultracold temperatures, we can actually observe the wave nature of atoms and molecules,\u201d she says.\n\nNext, Ni hopes to explore undiscovered rules of chemistry and to design new molecules. Other likely applications of absolute-zero experiments include precision sensors and clocks \u2014 maybe even the ultra-powerful quantum computers that tech companies keep promising. In the field of ultra-cold research, you might say the bottom is the limit.\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT PHYSICS?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Allan Smith and Ali Vitali", "title": "Judge calls Florida 'laughing stock of the world,' gives voters more time to fix ballots", "description": "U.S. District Judge Mark Walker made the comments during a hearing to extend the deadline to finish counting votes in Palm Beach County.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/judge-calls-florida-laughing-stock-world-gives-voters-more-time-n936656", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2647666/181115-florida-recount-al-1137_caa60f82bd06832b4b482dd633758bf1.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:00:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He has been living in Pennsylvania since the late 1990s.\n\nCareer officials at the agencies pushed back on the White House requests, the U.S. officials and people briefed on the requests said.\n\n\"At first there were eye rolls, but once they realized it was a serious request, the career guys were furious,\" said a senior U.S. official involved in the process.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council initially declined to comment on this story but after it published, said in a statement: \"The NSC has not been involved in nor aware of any discussions relating the extradition of Fethullah Gulen to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.\"\n\nThe Justice Department did not initially respond to a request for comment. But after the story was published Thursday, a spokesperson said the Justice Department continues to work with Turkey on Gulen's case, would review any materials Ankara provides and \"make any decisions about extradition on the basis of the facts and relevant U.S. law.\"\n\nOn Friday, the spokesperson added: \"The Justice Department has not been involved in nor aware of any discussions relating the extradition of Fethullah Gulen to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.\"\n\nThe State Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA lawyer representing Gulen declined to comment. The FBI also declined to comment.\n\nA Turkish official said the government does not link its concerns about the Khashoggi murder with Gulen's extradition case.\n\n\"We definitely see no connection between the two,\" the official said. \"We want to see action on the end of the United States in terms of the extradition of Gulen. And we're going to continue our investigation on behalf of the Khashoggi case.\"\n\nThe secret effort to resolve one of the leading tensions in U.S.-Turkey relations \u2014 Gulen's residency in the U.S. \u2014 provides a window into how President Donald Trump is trying to navigate hostility between two key allies after Saudi officials murdered Khashoggi on Oct. 2 at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.\n\nIt suggests the White House could be looking for ways to contain Erdogan's ire over the murder while preserving Trump's close alliance with Saudi Arabia's controversial de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe kingdom, after initially denying any role in Khashoggi's disappearance, reversed course and admitted that Saudi officials were responsible for the killing. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor recommended the death penalty for five out of the 11 suspects charged with killing Khashoggi. A total of 21 suspects have been arrested in connection with the case, according to Saud al-Mojeb.\n\nErdogan, meanwhile, has kept the pressure up by leaking pieces of evidence and repeatedly speaking out to accuse Prince Mohammed of orchestrating the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and outspoken critic of the Saudi leadership.\n\nSaudi Arabia is critical to Trump's Middle East policy. The White House's relationship with Prince Mohammed is key to Trump's goals of countering Iran and helping to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. Turkey is a NATO ally in possession of evidence about Khashoggi's murder that positions Erdogan to stoke international outrage over Riyadh's culpability in and cover-up of Khashoggi's murder.\n\nErdogan has for years demanded the U.S. send Gulen back to Turkey. The Turkish leader accuses the elderly cleric of being a terrorist who was behind a failed coup against Erdogan's government in 2016. After the coup attempt, Ankara made a formal request to the U.S. for Gulen's extradition.\n\nOne option that Turkish and Trump administration officials recently discussed is forcing Gulen to relocate to South Africa rather than sending him directly to Turkey if extradition is not possible, said the U.S. officials and people briefed on the discussions. But the U.S. does not have any legal justification to send Gulen to South Africa, they said, so that wouldn't be a viable option unless he went willingly.\n\nTrump and Erdogan also recently discussed another option to relieve tensions \u2014 the release of Turkish banker Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was sentenced in May to 32 months in prison by a U.S. federal judge for his role in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran, two people familiar with the discussion said. Erdogan has criticized the case against Atilla as a political attack aimed at undermining his government.\n\nThe U.S. and Turkey have been engaged in negotiations over a series of sensitive diplomatic issues over the past few months, including a deal for last month\u2019s release of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who was imprisoned in Turkey and an agreement for joint U.S. and Turkish military patrols in Manbij, Syria.\n\nThe Golden Generation Worship and Retreat Center in rural Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania on July 9, 2013. The private compound is where Fethullah Gulen, an influential Islamist cleric, has lived for more than a decade. Reuters file\n\nGulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the U.S. for almost two decades, denies any involvement in the failed coup in Turkey in 2016. A one-time ally of Erdogan, he's become an influential cleric with a wide network of followers known as \"Gulenistas.\" His movement includes a host of nonprofit organizations, businesses and schools, in the U.S., as well as South Africa.\n\nAfter Khashoggi's murder, Erdogan appeared to see an opportunity to ratchet up pressure on the Trump administration over Gulen, the U.S. officials and people familiar with the matter said.\n\nTurkish officials made clear to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during his Oct. 17 meeting with Erdogan in Ankara that they wanted the Trump administration to turn over Gulen, the U.S. officials and people familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"That was their number one ask,\" said a person briefed on the meeting.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo shaking hands with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during their meeting in Ankara, Turkey on Oct. 17, 2018. Turkish presidential office / EPA file\n\nPompeo asked if Erdogan had new evidence of Gulen's involvement in the failed coup, prompting the Turkish leader to try to make the case that Gulen has terrorist ties, a senior U.S. official briefed on the meeting said.\n\nIn remarks to reporters traveling with him, Pompeo acknowledged having discussed Gulen with the Turks. \"We did talk about Fethullah Gulen and we talked about the set of issues surrounding that organization as well,\" Pompeo said. \"It's something that the Turks remind us of often, and we're mindful of places that we can work with them to make sure that we all have a shared set of facts as well. But it's mostly not a State Department issue; it's mostly a Justice Department issue.\"\n\nThe Turkish official wouldn't discuss details of Erdogan's conversation with Pompeo but said, \"The Gulen issue is a part of any diplomatic conversation that we're having with our American counterparts.\"\n\nPompeo, who also met with Saudi leaders in Riyadh on that same trip, briefed Trump on his discussions after returning to Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration later sent word to Erdogan that officials would re-examine the Gulen issue, the U.S. officials and people familiar with the matter said.\n\nJustice Department officials responded to the White House's request saying the review of Turkey's case against Gulen two years ago showed no basis for his extradition and that no new evidence to justify it has emerged, the U.S. officials and others familiar with the requests said.\n\nTrump administration officials then asked for other options to legally remove him, the U.S. officials and others said.\n\nThey said the White House specifically wanted details about the terms under which Gulen resides in the U.S. Officials from the law enforcement agencies informed the White House there is no evidence that Gulen has broken any U.S. laws, the U.S. officials and others familiar with the requests said.\n\nThe requests on Gulen in mid-October mark at least the second time the Trump administration has re-examined Turkey's extradition request since taking office. In the weeks after Trump's inauguration, the White House asked the Justice Department to review Gulen's case, NBC has reported.\n\nSome officials have described the first request as a routine part of a new administration reviewing its relationship with a key ally. The request, however, took place under Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, whose ties to Turkey came under scrutiny in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling. Flynn, who resigned in February 2017, entered into a plea agreement with Mueller last December and has been cooperating with the investigation.\n\nTurkey provided boxes of materials to the U.S. in 2016 that Erdogan says shows Gulen was behind the failed coup. But officials at the Justice Department and FBI didn't find evidence that met the standard for extradition, which requires U.S. prosecutors to determine that someone committed crimes abroad that would also be illegal in the U.S.\n\nRelations between U.S. and Turkey have been strained under Trump.\n\nKhashoggi's disappearance after entering Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul introduced new friction. Turkey publicly accused Saudi Arabia of flying in an assassination team to murder Khashoggi. The two countries have long been rivals.\n\nAmid Saudi denials over Khashoggi's disappearance, Turkey ramped up international pressure on Riyadh by leaking its possession of evidence, including recordings from inside the consulate that Turkey officials say show the Saudi government murdered Khashoggi.\n\nAfter nearly a month, Saudi Arabia admitted its government officials carried out a premeditated murder of Khashoggi. The government, though, has insisted Prince Mohammed knew nothing of it in advance. Some officials from the U.S. and other countries have said they believe otherwise.\n\nErdogan said this past weekend that he's given Turkey's audio recording of Khashoggi's murder inside the consulate to U.S., U.K., Saudi, French and German government officials. His comments were a public reminder of the evidence Erdogan could expose at a time of his choosing, if he wanted to put pressure on the U.S. or Saudi Arabia. .\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, said Tuesday that U.S. officials who listened to Turkey's recording assessed it does not implicate Prince Mohammed.\n\nSaudi Arabia has yet to disclose the location of Khashoggi's remains, and Turkey continues to put public pressure on Riyadh.\n\nTrump has expressed reluctance to respond too strongly given Saudi Arabia's economic and strategic value to the U.S. At a news conference last week, Trump said he is working with Turkey, Congress and Saudi Arabia to determine next steps and will have a \"much stronger opinion\" on Khashoggi's killing over the next week.\n\nFollowing the Saudi prosecutor's announcement Thursday, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against 17 people for their suspected role in Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThe group includes Consul General Mohammed Alotaibi, who was in charge of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, as well as senior Saudi officials and members of the suspected assassination team who arrived in Istanbul in the hours before Khashoggi disappeared.\n\nThe 17 were sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act, which bars foreign officials from entering the U.S. and freezes any assets they have in American banks."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "U.S. returns 'Bells of Balangiga' to Philippines a century after clash", "description": "The decision to return the \"Bells of Balangiga\" to the Philippines ends a decades-long quest by Manila.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/u-s-returns-bells-balangiga-philippines-century-after-clash-n936651", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_33/2531026/180814-balangiga-bells-2001-ew-232p_0145a749733991f795b5e333436a124d.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:39:00Z", "content": "Nov. 15, 2018 / 4:39 PM GMT / Source: Reuters F.E.

He said the sacrifices of U.S. forces would not be forgotten.\n\n\"To those who fear we lose something by returning these bells, please hear me when I say: Bells mark time, but courage is timeless,\" Mattis said. \"It does not fade in history's dimly lit corridors.\"\n\nIn Manila, the Philippines' foreign affairs department cheered the move.\n\n\"Today is a time of solemn remembrance as we pay tribute to all those who gave up their lives during the Filipino-American War,\" it said.\n\nWyoming's Congressional delegation, which did not attend the ceremony, issued a terse statement.\n\n\"We continue to oppose any efforts by the Administration to move the Bells to the Philippines without the support of Wyoming\u2019s veterans community,\" Sens.

Liz Cheney told Reuters in a joint statement.\n\nAll three bells will be restored and handed over to the Philippines as early as December, said Joe Felter, deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe 1901 attack in Balangiga, on the Filipino island of Samar, was seen as perhaps the worst routing of U.S. soldiers since the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876, also known as Custer's Last Stand.\n\nAccording to historians, one or more of the church bells were rung to signal the attack in Balangiga.\n\nU.S. forces took the bells after a brutal counterattack that killed anywhere from hundreds to thousands of people in the Philippines, historians say. One U.S. general was said to have directed his troops to \"make the interior of Samar a howling wilderness.\"\n\nSome Wyoming veterans, like Cheryl Shannon at Veterans of Foreign Wars, said they were fine with the decision to return the bells.\n\n\"We're tired of it always being an issue,\" said Shannon, an Iraq war veteran.\n\nBut Hank Miller, a veteran with the VFW who wanted to keep the bells in Wyoming, said broader support for his position had faded as it became clear Washington would return the bells.\n\n\"I was advised to 'stop fighting a losing battle' and 'stop beating a dead horse' as the bells were going back,\" Miller told Reuters.\n\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Minyvonne Burke", "title": "Passenger found dead on Princess Cruises ship sailing in the Caribbean", "description": "\"The incident was reported to the FBI and local authorities and the local authorities met and boarded the ship upon arrival in Aruba,\" the cruise line said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/passenger-falls-her-death-princess-cruises-ship-sailing-caribbean-n936611", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2647451/181115-royal-princess-cruise-mn-1000_abaa2351bfb89de1675f2817c323444d.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:36:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

President Donald Trump and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., both call for upgrades to the nation\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 and they promise to work across the aisle to get it done.\n\nLet\u2019s hope they mean it. America\u2019s infrastructure requires attention for a host of reasons, including badly failing systems and the need to create high-paying jobs. In an era of agonizing divisions, it\u2019s also the right time to think about ways to bring citizens together \u2014 literally as well as figuratively. Large-scale infrastructure projects can do that \u2014 not just in Washington, but across the entire nation. Two ideas stand out for their potential to connect people: broadband access and high-speed rail.\n\nThe gulf between cities and non-cities has been a hot topic among social scientists over the last decade. Research reveals that the divide is economic: poverty levels are higher, businesses less resilient and jobs scarcer for those who don\u2019t live in urban areas. Social trends add to the gap, with rural Americans experiencing poorer health outcomes and fewer educational opportunities than city-dwellers.\n\nAmerica\u2019s infrastructure requires attention for a host of reasons, including badly failing systems and the need to create high-paying jobs.\n\nPolitically, Americans show division by location: 2016 voting maps illustrate Hillary Clinton\u2019s success in urban areas across the country, while Trump fared better in suburban and rural communities, which have shifted toward Republican candidates since 2008. (Suburban areas, however, showed movement toward Democrats in the 2018 midterms.) A perception of divergent values also worries some observers.\n\nHistory shows how infrastructure programs can help bridge these gulfs.\n\nBefore President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s rural electrification program in the 1930s, most country people spent the bulk of their days coping with backbreaking chores and had limited contact with the outside world. Once power lines arrived, life was transformed. People could listen to radio newscasts and hear the sound of Roosevelt\u2019s voice in his fireside chats. Farmers accessed up-to-date livestock prices and weather reports \u2014 a tremendous asset. Women used timesaving miracles including washing machines and electric stoves.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt during one of his fireside chats in Washington circa 1937. Underwood Archives / Getty Images file\n\nWith more leisure hours, families could enjoy \"Lone Ranger\" and \"Buck Rogers\" serials over the airwaves. People everywhere could share the same information and entertainment, bringing about a convergence of values between the city and country. Rural electrification helped lessen the economic gap, bringing growth to people outside of cities that would provide benefits for decades to come.\n\nToday, infrastructure programs can once again bring large numbers of people into the stream of modern American life and prosperity.\n\nA lack of high-quality internet connection impacts 24 million Americans and denies them basic economic, social and cultural opportunities. Rural areas are particularly hard hit, according to the Federal Communications Commission. In rural Mississippi, a whopping half of the population can\u2019t get reliable internet, but problems with access affect Americans in every single state.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that the country\u2019s aging and overburdened transportation systems waste time and decrease productivity.\n\nWithout high-speed broadband, people face hurdles trying to run a business, finding job postings, filing taxes and taking advantage of online education. Ranchers miss out on livestock auctions and farmers can\u2019t use the internet to monitor crops. And nobody gets to binge-watch \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\nThe dense network of services that exists in urban areas isn\u2019t found in rural regions. Schools, hospitals, libraries and emergency services all rely on fast internet connections. Those without broadband are left out of things like telemedicine, which can help women without access to family planning services, along with financial services like online banking. Broadband can be transformative to communities and mitigate the digital divide that creates technology haves and have-nots.\n\nBetter, faster and more reliable trains can also help bring Americans together in a variety of ways. It\u2019s pretty clear that the country\u2019s aging and overburdened transportation systems waste time and decrease productivity. The kind of high-speed rail enjoyed by people in most other developed countries is more than a benefit to those commuting between big cities. It can serve smaller destinations by adding new segments of high-speed track to the country\u2019s existing railroad network. Those living outside of cities can use it to connect to other forms of transportation like major airports.\n\nMillions of Americans who can\u2019t conveniently travel to high-quality medical facilities, universities and entertainment venues would benefit from new train stops planned along city-to-city lines. Improved rail services would also entice more people, like teachers and university faculty, to work in rural communities and small towns. New passenger rail lines could boost the economies of smaller communities by making it easier for people to work in cities, and also make it more convenient for people to come to visit and do business.\n\nTrains also give travelers and commuters opportunities to relax and socialize with one another face-to-face, improving social and geographical isolation. They\u2019re not only people-friendly; they\u2019re also more environmentally friendly than flying or driving alone.\n\nAll this may sound great, but as surely as the sun rises, there will be huge obstacles to achieving these benefits. Democrats and Republicans in Washington will have to compromise on how to prioritize and fund such programs. It\u2019s likely that powerful industries will attempt to halt progress as they have in the past \u2014 like the cable and telephone lobbyists who resist broadband, and airlines that fear losing business to high-speed rail.\n\nPolitics will also get in the way of progress. There will be conflicts over which party can take credit for improvements.\n\nIf politicians forget their promises to work together, a great opportunity to restore the country\u2019s wellbeing and unity on many levels will be lost. America has achieved big, ambitious goals in the past, but over the last generation, success has been stymied by forces that divide us, like growing inequality and the undue influence of the wealthy and corporations on our political system. Connecting America will, above all, require overcoming the disconnect in Washington."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "DATELINE WEEKEND MYSTERY SNEAK PEEK: The Face of Evil", "description": "When 21-year-old student is found murdered along a Texas road, detectives begin to hunt for her killer.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration announced two major attacks on the tobacco industry Thursday, saying it will start the process to ban menthol in cigarettes and limit sales of flavored e-cigarettes to youths.\n\nThe FDA's long-deliberated moves are driven by new figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing a 78 percent increase in vaping by high school students, with 3.6 million high school and middle school students now using e-cigarettes.\n\nCalling the numbers \u201castonishing,\" FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said he was stepping up his agency\u2019s actions to curb youth vaping.\n\n\"Among high school students, current e-cigarette use increased from 1.5 percent in 2011 to 20.8 percent in 2018,'' the CDC report reads.\n\n\u201cThese data shock my conscience: From 2017 to 2018, there was a 78 percent increase in current e-cigarette use among high school students and a 48 percent increase among middle school students,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nHe said he would speed up FDA action to limit sales of flavored electronic cigarette products to underage users, both in stores and online, and said he was starting the process to ban menthol in cigarettes.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s plans had been widely leaked last week but Gottlieb\u2019s announcement has changed somewhat since then. He said he would use the agency\u2019s power to try to force outlets to sequester sales of vaping products to keep them away from teens and children.\n\n\"We're not telling the retail stores you can't sell them,\" Gottlieb said. \"If the establishments want to continue to sell these fruity flavored products, they're going to have to put into place measures that will make sure they are not going to get into the hands of kids,\" Gottlieb told NBC News.\n\nHe said he was also starting the bureaucratic process for banning menthol in all combustible cigarettes, and to ban flavors in cigars. This is a longer-term process and one likely to be fought every step of the way by the tobacco industry, which has succeeded for years in protecting menthol products from regulation.\n\n\"More than half (54 percent) of youth smokers ages 12-17 use menthol cigarettes, compared to less than one-third of smokers ages 35 and older,\" Gottlieb said. \"We will advance a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would seek to ban menthol in combustible tobacco products, including cigarettes and cigars,\" he added.\n\nAnti-smoking advocates praised the moves, while questioning how easy it would be to enforce them. For one thing, vape products are sold in a variety of outlets, said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cIt\u2019s a loophole big enough for a truck to go through,\u201d Myers told NBC News.\n\n\u201c(Gottlieb) doesn\u2019t define age-restricted, in-person locations. For this to have any effect, that has got to be a very vigorous definition.\u201d\n\nGottlieb told NBC that measures might include a curtained-off section where vapes are sold. Online sales will need age verification protocols, he said.\n\nGroups such as the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said the FDA has moved far too slowly to limit teen vaping. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any question that the last six-plus years the FDA has failed to take the action necessary to prevent this from happening,\u201d Myers said.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics also called on the FDA to do more.\n\n\u201cEven with new sales restrictions announced today by FDA preventing flavored e-cigarettes from being sold at certain brick and mortar storefronts, teens will still find ways to access them. E-cigarette products that appeal to children have no business in the marketplace, period,\" the group's president, Dr. Colleen Kraft, said in a statement.\n\nMyers had more praise for the decision to finally start the process of banning menthol in cigarettes and flavored cigars, something advocates have been demanding for years.\n\n\u201cOverall, the proposal on menthol cigarettes and on flavored cigars has the potential to make an enormous public health impact,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe combined impact of those two proposals would reduce tobacco use and deaths from tobacco use more than anything FDA has done to date.\u201d\n\nMenthol products are favorites of teenagers. \u201cMore than 50 percent of the kids in this country who smoke start on and use menthol cigarettes,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the others use flavored cigars.\u201d\n\nThe NAACP welcomed the proposed menthol ban. \"For decades, data have shown that the tobacco industry has successfully and intentionally marketed mentholated cigarettes to African Americans and particularly African American women as 'replacement smokers' (and) that menthol smokers have a harder time quitting smoking,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that teenagers who vape often go on to smoke combustible cigarettes.\n\n\u201cWe know that teens using these products who were not smokers in the first place are four times more likely to go on to smoke cigarettes,\u201d said Robin Koval, CEO of the Truth Initiative, a foundation started to battle smoking.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said it seems clear that e-cigarettes can be used by adult smokers as a safer alternative to burnt tobacco. \"But in trying to build this off-ramp from a deadly addiction, we cannot let e-cigarettes become an on-ramp for kids to enter a lifetime of nicotine addiction and tobacco use,\" Azar said.\n\nVirtually all smokers start before the age of 21, so stopping teen smoking is key to reducing tobacco deaths. According to the CDC, smoking kills more than 480,000 people a year in the U.S. \u201cOn average, smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers,\u201d the CDC says.\n\nGottlieb said the FDA would not as yet limit menthol and mint flavors in electronic cigarette products because he did not want to make menthol cigarettes an appealing alternative once vape products are harder for kids to get.\n\nTobacco companies signaled they would fight efforts to ban menthol.\n\n\"We continue to believe that a total ban on menthol cigarettes or flavored cigars would be an extreme measure not supported by the science and evidence,\" Altria, which makes a range of tobacco products, said in a statement. \"We expect that establishing product standards on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars will be a multi-year, deliberative process, and we will be fully engaged throughout.\"\n\nSome companies, including Altria, Blu and Juul, said they were already working to limit underage sales.\n\nMyers was skeptical of the announcements by Juul, especially. The company got widespread media coverage of its announcements this week that it would limit sales of flavored products and stop social media campaigns.\n\n\u201cJuul is smart enough to try to use FDA actions to falsely create an impression of it as a caring, responsible company,\u201d he said.\n\nJuul now dominates the e-cigarette market with its small, sleek, pod-based product that delivers a far heftier dose of addictive nicotine than other vape devices.\n\n\u201cHaving used social media to gain market dominance among young people, Juul can step back now because it no longer needs to pay for social media. Its young, addicted customers are doing it for them. It\u2019s stunning to me,\u201d Myers said.\n\n\u201cIt is so completely out of the Big Tobacco playbook it is unbelievable,\u201d he added.\n\nJuul\u2019s sales are close to $1 billion and the company is valued at $15 billion.\n\n\u201cThey started out saying they never wanted to market to kids even though their marketing is completely directed at kids. It\u2019s hard to imagine a product more appealing to kids.\u201d\n\nAnd Koval worried about relying on voluntary actions by companies. \"Depending on the tobacco industry and the retail trade is not enough,\" she said. \"They need to get rid of all the flavors. They need to ban online sales. We need real marketing restrictions for e-cigarettes.\"\n\nThe vaping industry says its flavors are meant to appeal to adults but anti-tobacco advocates, medical groups and even politicians reject this argument. \"It\u2019s ludicrous to think flavors like bubble gum, cotton candy, or tutti frutti are meant for adults,\" senators Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, and Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said in a joint statement.\n\n\"E-cigarette companies want to hook another generation of Americans onto a deadly and addictive product so they have a customer for life. These flavors are the key to their callous business strategy, and they have no business being sold on the market.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "David K.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Alex Seitz-Wald and Jonathan Allen\n\nRIVIERA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 A manual recount in the Florida Senate race was ordered Thursday by the secretary of state after Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, marginally increased his lead over Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in a machine recount.\n\nScott leads Nelson by 12,603 votes \u2014 or about .15 percent \u2014 which is less than the .25 percent margin he would have needed to forestall a hand recount. But there won't be a manual recount of the governor's race, in which Republican Ron DeSantis is ahead by about 34,000 votes \u2014 or .41 percent \u2014 after the machine tally.\n\nUnder the order, Florida's counties have until Sunday at noon to complete manual recounts of \"over-votes\" and \"under-votes\" \u2014 where machines interpreted that the voter either marked multiple candidates in one race or voted in some races and not others, or had marked the ballot in an ambiguous way that didn't indicate a clear preference for a candidate.\n\nThere are believed to be tens of thousands of ballots statewide that will need to be closely examined.\n\nWhile most of Florida handled the machine recount with little fanfare, the state's second- and third-largest counties, Broward and Palm Beach, failed to meet the 3 p.m. Thursday deadline. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, said mechanical issues hobbled the process.\n\nBucher said the deadline passed despite a \"heroic effort\" by her staff. As a result, the results Palm Beach County originally reported to the state \u2014 not those from a machine recount \u2014 stood. The state's election results are to be certified by Tuesday.\n\nIn Broward County, election officials thought they had sent machine-tabulated totals to the state in time but missed the mark by two minutes, prompting the secretary of state to reject the results.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, there are roughly 5,900 ballots for which an over- or under-count could affect the Senate race totals, according to Bucher. Manual recount tables already had been set up on folding tables at a warehouse here in South Florida by the time Bucher spoke.\n\n\"The reality is that we were very close two nights ago and then our machines went down. It's not for lack of human effort,\" Bucher had said earlier in the day, referring to an overheating issue with the county's out-of-date equipment.\n\nOn the eve of the deadline Wednesday night, ballot-counting machines sat idle and the counting floor sat empty for hours, even as other counties' offices have hummed with activity 24/7.\n\nBucher had said earlier Wednesday that the machines were working again, but by sundown, she waved away reporters who asked why none of them were running before climbing into her black Mercedes and driving away from the facility at around 9 p.m.\n\nMiami-Dade, the state's largest county, completed their recount a day and a half ahead of schedule, while officials in neighboring Broward County, which has had its own problems, was among the counties that made the Thursday deadline.\n\nBucher said her team had expected a quiet midterm election and did not anticipate the need to run the county\u2019s machines, manufactured by a now defunct company, all day and night during a multi-race recount.\n\nThe county has set aside more than $11 million to purchase newer machines, but Bucher said she had been waiting for the state legislature to tweak a new law that she says, once it goes into effect in two years, would make the new machines obsolete."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Pence on Mueller investigation: 'We'll continue to cooperate'", "description": "Following his remarks at the 6th U.S.-ASEAN Summit, Vice President Mike Pence spoke with NBC News' Vaughn Hillyard about the recent appointment of Matthew Whitaker to acting Attorney General and whether Whitaker will end the Mueller investigation.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/pence-talks-mueller-investigation-matthew-whitaker-1371357763540", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/f_mo_pence_mueller_181115.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:24:08Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Pence talks Mueller investigation, Matthew Whitaker copied!\n\nFollowing his remarks at the 6th U.S.-ASEAN Summit, Vice President Mike Pence spoke with NBC News' Vaughn Hillyard about the recent appointment of Matthew Whitaker to acting Attorney General and whether Whitaker will end the Mueller investigation.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Wisconsin company offers handguns as Christmas bonus for employees", "description": "BenShot, a Wisconsin company that makes novelty glassware embedded with bullets, has rolled out an unusual Christmas bonus for employees: firearms safety training and the handgun of your choice.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Before Election Day 2018, Republicans held 13 of the 40 congressional districts with the highest share of adults over 25 with a college degree.\n\nAfter the midterms, however, that\u2019s now down to just four. And if Rep. Mimi Walters in California ultimately loses her still-uncalled re-election race, as expected, it\u2019ll be just three Republicans remaining. (Those three are Van Taylor, who succeeded Rep. Sam Johnson in Texas; Ann Wagner in Missouri; and Susan Brooks in Indiana.)\n\nThat surge of Democratic enthusiasm from college-educated voters was captured in the exit polls, too. Overall, college graduates broke for Democrats in the midterms by 20 percentage points, while those with no college degree were equally split. Among only white college graduates, Democrats had an advantage of 8 percentage points. And among just female while college graduates, it was 20 points.\n\nBut that college divide isn\u2019t just about midterm races in highly educated districts. We saw a similar divide in 2016, when President Donald Trump won all but three states (Delaware, Nevada, New Mexico) where the share of college graduates is BELOW the national average of 32 percent, while Clinton won all but three states (Utah, Kansas and Montana) where the share is ABOVE the national average. (It\u2019s no coincidence that Republicans experienced midterm setbacks in all three of those states \u2014 a possible loss by Mia Love in UT-4; the GOP defeats in KS-GOV and KS-3; and Jon Tester\u2019s re-election in Montana.)\n\nAnd for 2020 \u2026 while exit polls weren\u2019t available for every state in the country, there\u2019s evidence from those that were available that Trump\u2019s approval rating is underwater in at least two more hugely important swing states with a college population that\u2019s close to the national average:\n\nPennsylvania (Trump job approval: 45 percent approve/55 percent disapprove; 31.4 percent with a college degree)\n\nWisconsin (Trump job approval: 48 percent approve/52 percent disapprove; 30.4 percent with a college degree).\n\nGOP gets steam-rolled in California and New Jersey\n\nSpeaking of our great political realignment, NBC News yesterday declared Democrat Andy Kim the apparent winner in the NJ-3 district represented by Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., who had forged the House GOP compromise on its 2017 repeal-and-replace bill. That means that Republicans will hold only one congressional seat in the Garden State next year.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans appear to be on the verge of losing almost every competitive race in California as more ballots get counted in the Golden State (we told you that counting process would take a while!).\n\nCount absentee ballots with missing voter info in GA-GOV race, judge rules\n\nMeanwhile, in Georgia, a federal judge ruled that \u201cGeorgia counties must count absentee ballots even if the voter\u2019s date of birth is incorrect or missing, and he is preventing the state from finalizing election results until that happens,\u201d the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\n\u201cAlthough U.S. District Judge Steve Jones agreed with the Georgia Democratic Party and Stacey Abrams\u2019 campaign on this issue, he ruled against them on two others. He will not require counties to accept absentee ballots with incorrect residence addresses or to accept provisional ballots cast by people who attempted to vote in a different county than where they are registered to vote.\u201d\n\nThe uncalled Senate races (one)\n\nFL-SEN (Scott leads Nelson by 12,562 votes as the contest heads to a manual recount)\n\n(MS-SEN goes to runoff)\n\nThe uncalled GOV races (one)\n\nGA-GOV (GOPer Brian Kemp remains at 50.3 percent)\n\nThe uncalled House races (seven)\n\n\u2014 CA-10 (NBC News declared Dem Josh Harder the apparent winner)\n\nCA-39 (GOPer Young Kim barely leads Dem Gil Cisernos, 50.0 percent to 50.0 percent)\n\nCA-45 (Dem Katie Porter leads GOPer Mimi Walters, 50.8 percent to 49.2 percent)\n\n\u2014 CA-48 (NBC News declared Dem Harley Rouda the apparent winner)\n\nGA-7 (GOPer Rob Woodall is ahead, 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent)\n\nME-2 (it appears the race is headed to ranked choice to determine the winner)\n\nNM-2 (NBC News retracted its earlier call in favor of the Republicans; Dem Xochitl Torres Small is ahead, 51 percent to 49 percent)\n\nNC-9 (GOPer Mark Harris is ahead, 49.4 percent to 48.8 percent)\n\n\u2014 NJ-3 (NBC News declared Dem Andy Kim the apparent winner)\n\nUT-4 (Dem Ben McAdams is ahead, 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent)\n\nThe state of play for Pelosi\u2019s speakership fight\n\nAs we noted yesterday, there\u2019s a not-insignificant number of Democrats who have publicly expressed reservations about supporting Nancy Pelosi for House Speaker. The struggle for those foes had been that no obvious alternative had emerged to challenge her. Now, a few names are now bubbling up, including Marsha Fudge of Ohio (who says \u201cI need to give it some thought and see if I have an interest\u201d) and Karen Bass of California. And somewhere around 17 Democrats so far are reportedly preparing to release a letter pledging not to support Pelosi on the floor \u2014 rather than just opposing her behind closed doors.\n\nThe questions we have: How much support will those Pelosi foes ultimately get and can they maintain that level of opposition until the vote is actually held early next year?\n\nTrump lashes out again on Mueller\n\nHere\u2019s what the president tweeted early this morning about the Mueller investigation: \u201cThe inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don\u2019t... care how many lives they ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won\u2019t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\u201d\n\nFirst, a quick fact check here: Mueller worked as the nonpartisan FBI director under George W. Bush for eight years and then continued his tenure for four years under Obama.\n\nSecond: Where exactly did this come from? And is it an indication that the president thinks Mueller will be speaking up in the form of a legal filing or two this week?\n\nTrump backs sentencing-reform bill\n\n\u201cPresident Donald Trump pledged his support for a major overhaul of sentencing laws and prisoner re-entry programs at the White House on Wednesday,\u201d NBC\u2019s Jonathan Allen and Hallie Jackson write. \u201cTrump's backing for the package, which is still being drafted in the Senate, has been seen as a key factor in providing political cover for Republicans and Democrats to vote for an overhaul that would diminish criminal penalties for some offenders and make it easier for former inmates to find work.\u201d\n\nNational security aide targeted by first lady leaves the White House\n\nNBC News: \u201cMelania Trump got her wish when the Trump administration said Wednesday that Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel was leaving the White House a day after the first lady called for Ricardel to be fired.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Mira Ricardel will continue to support the president as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the administration,\u2019 White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday. \u2018The president is grateful for Ms. Ricardel's continued service to the American people and her steadfast pursuit of his national security priorities.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cRicardel's next assignment wasn't immediately announced.\u201d\n\nTexts show Stone and friend discussing WikiLeaks plans in 2016\n\n\u201cSix days before WikiLeaks began releasing Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails, Roger Stone had a text message conversation with a friend about WikiLeaks,\u201d per NBC\u2019s Anna Schecter. \"\u2018Big news Wednesday,\u2019 the Stone pal, radio host Randy Credico, wrote on Oct. 1, 2016, according to the text messages provided by Stone. \u2018Now pretend u don\u2019t know me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018U died 5 years ago,\u2019 Stone replied.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Great,\u2019 Credico wrote back. \u2018Hillary\u2019s campaign will die this week.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cCredico turned out to be wrong on one count \u2014 nothing incriminating about Clinton came out that Wednesday. But two days later, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks released its first dump of emails stolen from Podesta, altering the trajectory of the 2016 presidential election.\u201d\n\nOur take: The question has always been whether Stone shared this WikiLeaks information with the Trump campaign. What did they know? And when did they know it?\n\nTheresa May\u2019s government is crumbling\n\nThe latest from across the pond, from NBC News: \u201cBleary-eyed political and business leaders across Europe were on Thursday digesting the 585-page Brexit deal, the latest milepost in the E.U. divorce saga gripping the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. Even as most were still finishing breakfast, the agreement was dealt a potentially fatal blow when one of its key architects, the U.K. Brexit Secretary, resigned in protest. Dominic Raab quit Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government, saying her proposals could lead to the constitutional breakup of the United Kingdom. He is the second Brexit Secretary to have quit in less than six months.\n\nMORE: \"It was one of four ministerial resignations early Thursday \u2014 casting doubt on May\u2019s claim to have secured the support of her cabinet \u2014 and came even before she addressed angry lawmakers in the House of Commons.

We never thought, for example, that we were going to play in Israel or that we were going to be playing two years ago in the White House.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen Latin artists honored the band with renditions of its greatest hits. Gilberto Santa Rosa sang a salsa version of \u201cBendita tu Luz,\u201d Pablo Albor\u00e1n performed a pop rendition of \u201cRayando el Sol,\u201d and Pepe Aguilar accompanied by the Mariachi Sol de M\u00e9xico de Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez interpreted \u201cMariposa Traicionera.\u201d\n\nThe academy bestowed the honor on the band for its achievements and contributions to the Latin community and support of environmental protection and human rights causes.\n\nMan\u00e1 has highlighted environmental, social, political and human rights issues for more than 30 years through its songs, concerts and, more recently, social media. It has also promoted the Latino vote in the U.S. and has denounced what it deems as social injustices in countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia.\n\nOlvera on Monday visited a temporary shelter in the Mexican state of Jalisco where members of a caravan of Central Americans attempting to reach the U.S. border were resting. He offered them words of encouragement and sang \u201cRayando el Sol\u201d y \u201cEl Muelle de San Blas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went to see them. We\u2019ve been supporting the immigrants here in the United States for more than 20 years,\u201d Olvera said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we are brothers, we are human beings... We shouldn\u2019t be afraid of them... I told them be careful. I saw babies, I saw children. It was sad, but they have a lot of hope.\u201d\n\nGonz\u00e1lez added that the immigrants wouldn\u2019t be on this journey \u201cif there wasn\u2019t so much corruption in the countries they\u2019re coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody wants to leave their country,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said on the red carpet. \u201cThese people are running away from a lot of very drastic situations. It\u2019s a humanitarian crisis, but we have to help these people one way or another. Yes, it\u2019s illegal to enter a country, but as Fher says, brothers and sisters, humanitarian crisis, we have to help them.\u201d\n\nThe band established the nonprofit Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra in 1996. It works to preserve endangered species, offers educational programs on the environment and organizes community development projects.\n\nMana has won six Latin Grammys and four Grammys and has released more than 48 No. 1 hits worldwide.

Whitaker is now overseeing Mueller.\n\nThe expressions of public anger also comes after reports this week that the president has been stewing inside the White House, angry at staff and world leaders and seemingly deeply unhappy with the course of events.\n\nOther Trump tweets Thursday morning questioned why Hillary Clinton is being protected, charged that Mueller and his \"gang of Democratic thugs\" had ruined lives, and accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of bias in favor of Democrats \u2014 what the president called \"the real collusion.\"\n\nLater Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ripped Trump over his tweets, saying that he \"continues to wage an all-out campaign to obstruct the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nPelosi also said Trump installed Whitaker \"for one purpose \u2014 to end the investigation.\"\n\nJust hours before Trump's initial tweets, Vice President Mike Pence had a different take on the Mueller investigation in an exclusive interview with NBC's Vaughn Hillyard at the ASEAN Summit in Singapore.\n\n\"I think the people can be confident that we'll continue to cooperate, but they can also be confident that we're going to continue to focus on the issues that matter most to them,\" Pence said.\n\nFor much of the two months prior to Election Day, Mueller's probe into Russian electoral interference and possible ties between Trump's campaign and Moscow went largely quiet \u2014 as had been expected \u2014 due to Department of Justice guidelines that recommend not taking any law enforcement actions within 60 days of an election to avoid influencing voters or giving the appearance of swaying them.\n\nAnd during that time period, with no public developments on the Mueller front, Trump stayed largely quiet on the issue, too. But with midterms now in the rear view mirror, Trump's has criticism has resumed.\n\nOn Tuesday, NBC News, citing a source familiar with the matter, reported that Trump's legal team was nearing completion of written answers to questions posed by Mueller that may be submitted as early as this week. The answers will pertain only to matters relating to Russian interference in the 2016 election, not obstruction of justice, the source said.\n\nEarlier this month, NBC News and The New York Times reported on how longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and right-wing conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi have found themselves at the center of the investigation.\n\nNBC News reported that Mueller's office obtained communications that suggested Corsi, whom Mueller subpoenaed in September, may have had advance knowledge that emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta were stolen and provided to WikiLeaks."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "How exercise benefits your brain as well as your body", "description": "Both your brain and your body really do want you to exercise.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/better/video/how-exercise-benefits-your-brain-as-well-as-your-body-1371318851840", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/d_better_brain_exercise_181115.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:21:07Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "How exercise benefits your brain as well as your body copied!\n\nBoth your brain and your body really do want you to exercise.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Joe Fryer, Dennis Romero", "title": "Thousand Oaks shooting: Wife of deputy killed in California massacre calls him a hero", "description": "Wife of sheriff's Deputy Ron Helus, killed in mass shooing in Thousand Oaks, California, says husband charged into dangerous situations to protect others.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/thousand-oaks-shooting-wife-deputy-killed-california-massacre-calls-him-n936476", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2647131/181115-ron-helus-family-mc-360_ec1c3ac31eb68a9364b1453f84bc18e5.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:43:42Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nATLANTA \u2014 As Democrats ratcheted up their attacks on Georgia Republican Brian Kemp, he claimed Wednesday that results certified by county election officials confirm he has an \"insurmountable lead\" in the governor's race.\n\nAt a news conference, Georgia Democrats cast doubt on the legitimacy of any election count that ends with the former secretary of state being certified as the winner of a fiercely fought election against Stacey Abrams, who's seeking to become the first black woman elected governor in the U.S.\n\n\"We believe that Brian Kemp mismanaged this election to sway it in his favor,\" said Abrams' campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo, surrounded by Democratic lawmakers at the Georgia Capitol.\n\nDemocrats beyond Georgia have started to echo the notion that a Kemp victory would be illegitimate. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown said Wednesday that if Abrams loses it's because Republicans stole the election.\n\n\"If Stacey Abrams doesn't win in Georgia, they stole it. I say that publicly, it's clear,\" Brown, speaking at a briefing for the National Action Network.\n\nKemp's campaign, which has repeatedly called on Abrams to concede, repeated that call Wednesday, saying Abrams and her supporters have used \"fake vote totals,\" ''desperate press conferences\" and \"dangerous lawsuits\" to try to steal the election.\n\n\"After all of the theatrics, the math remains the same,\" Kemp campaign spokesman Cody Hall said in an email. \"Abrams lost and Brian Kemp won. This election is over.\"\n\nSince he declared himself governor last week and resigned as secretary of state, Kemp's lead has narrowed as counties have tabulated more ballots. And the numbers could change again as federal courts issue new guidance on counting certain provisional and absentee ballots.\n\nGroh-Wargo said Tuesday that the Abrams campaign believes she needs a net gain of 17,759 votes to pull Kemp below a majority threshold and force a Dec. 4 runoff. Kemp's campaign said even if every vote that Abrams campaign is arguing for is granted by the courts and counted for her, she cannot overcome his lead or force a runoff.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the race.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. District Judge Steve Jones on Wednesday ruled that the secretary of state must not certify the state election results without confirming that each county's vote tally includes absentee ballots on which the voter's date of birth is missing or incorrect.\n\nThe order stems from a request in a lawsuit filed Sunday by the Abrams campaign. But Jones also rejected the campaign's other requests.\n\nHe declined to extend the period during which evidence could be submitted to prove the eligibility of voters who cast provisional ballots. He also declined to order that provisional ballots cast by voters who went to a precinct in the wrong county be counted.\n\nThe lawsuit was one of several election-related complaints filed before multiple federal judges.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leigh May ordered Gwinnett County election officials Tuesday not to reject absentee ballots just because the voter's birth year is missing or wrong. She also ordered the county to delay certification of its election results until those ballots have been counted.\n\nJones' ruling effectively extended May's order to the other 158 counties in Georgia.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg late Monday ordered state officials not to do their final certification of election results before 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nState law sets a Nov. 20 deadline, but secretary of state's office elections director Chris Harvey testified last week that the state had planned to certify the election results Wednesday, a day after the deadline for counties to certify their results. He said that would allow preparations to begin for any runoff contests, including those already projected in the races for secretary of state and a Public Service Commission seat.\n\nTotenberg's order left untouched the county certification deadline. Candice Broce, a spokeswoman for secretary of state's office, said Wednesday that all counties but Gwinnett have certified their totals."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "British pound plunges again amid Brexit chaos", "description": "The British pound plunged on Thursday as opposition mounted at Prime Minister Theresa May's draft deal for leaving the European Union.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/sterling-heads-second-biggest-drop-year-brexit-deal-faces-hurdles-n936521", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2644826/181113-theresa-may-brexit-ew-110p_de6cd4f57787895c0d261373cb70a9e8.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:04:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Lawmakers on Thursday called for a leadership contest that could topple her as head of the ruling Conservative party and as Prime Minister.\n\nWith only 134 days left until Brexit, time is running out to reach some kind of customs agreement with the E.U., which remains Britain\u2019s biggest trade partner. Without any deal, the U.K. faces chaos at borders and ports \u2014 a scenario that has already prompted the stockpiling of food and medicines.\n\nMay\u2019s proposal was finally published late Wednesday after 20 months of painfully slow negotiations.\n\nHours later, a string of her own ministers resigned in protest including Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, who warned the plan could lead to the constitutional breakup of the United Kingdom.\n\nMay said her agreement was the only way to avoid \u201ca path of deep and grave uncertainty,\u201d adding: \"Nobody has produced any alternative proposal.\u201d\n\nBut an increasing number of lawmakers now believe that crashing out of the E.U. without any agreement \u2014 a so-called \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario \u2014 would be better than May\u2019s proposal.\n\n\"We're in the Brexs**t,\u201d read Thursday's front page in The Sun, Britain's bestselling tabloid newspaper.\n\nCan the Brexit deal survive?\n\nGetting any deal through Parliament was always going to be difficult for May, who needs the votes of about 320 of the 650 lawmakers to support the agreement. The Conservatives are a minority government that is propped up by members of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\n\nBut the DUP will not back any deal that treats the British province differently from the rest of the United Kingdom, and the main opposition Labour Party said Thursday it would also vote against the plan.\n\nA former minister, Iain Duncan Smith, said Raab\u2019s departure would likely kill the deal and could even lead to May\u2019s ouster in a party leadership challenge.\n\nEsther McVey was another British ministerial resignation on Thursday.

He said May's party was \"at war with itself beyond anything I\u2019ve ever witnessed.\u201d\n\nWhat are the sticking points in the deal?\n\nAt the heart of the current stalemate is the state of the post-Brexit border between Ireland \u2014 an E.U. member \u2014 and Northern Ireland, one of the four nations that make up the U.K. The border region has been the focus of deadly violence in the past, and, after the March 29 Brexit deadline, it will be the only land border between the E.U. and Britain.\n\nAll sides agree there should be no customs checks or other infrastructure on the border \u2014 a key condition of a 1998 peace deal \u2014 but there is no agreement on how and where those checks should take place.\n\nAnother sticking point in talks has been Britain's insistence that any E.U.-aligned customs arrangement must be temporary. The E.U. says that, in order to guarantee an open border, it can't have a time limit.\n\nAn anti-Brexit demonstrator outside the House of Commons in London. Tolga Akmen / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nMay's draft plan reportedly involves a \"swimming pool\" solution in which there would be no hard border but Northern Ireland would face deeper levels of regulation in order to allow frictionless trade with Ireland.\n\nIt means Northern Ireland will remain bound by E.U. laws on sales tax, farm subsidies and state aid \u2014 something unacceptable to many Conservatives.\n\nShailesh Vara, who was the first minister to quit Thursday, said: \u201cIt is a sad day when we are reduced to obeying rules made by other countries who have shown they do not have our best interests at heart. We can and must do better than this.\"\n\nWhat else is in the deal?\n\nThe draft deal seeks a smooth divorce from the rest of the E.U. Without it, Britain would have to restore full border controls at its ports facing France, with the likelihood of huge delays in the supply along key trading routes.\n\nThe deal proposes an emergency fix to ensure no return of a hard border on Ireland, and keeps the status quo until the end of 2020, with an option to extend it once.\n\nSterling is on track for its biggest fall in 2 years in a big day for Theresa May and Brexit https://t.co/s3evZRid1o pic.twitter.com/P0ajvNKnq5 \u2014 Financial Times (@FinancialTimes) November 15, 2018\n\nAccess to fisheries would be renegotiated separately, and there would be some checks on goods crossing from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland to ensure compliance with E.U. standards.\n\nThe E.U.\u2019s top court, the European Court of Justice, would remain the ultimate arbiter for issues specified in a finalized deal.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nMay hopes to calm the anger and press ahead.

The death of both parents in 3 months. A firstborn child heading off to her first year of college. A family pet dying.\n\nI had dealt with all four of these life-altering situations over the past year and, coupled with me running a thriving business and single parenting five children, my stressful life had finally caught up with me. After dropping off my daughter Emily at college, my 47-year-old heart wasn\u2019t feeling right. And, I don\u2019t mean I felt heartbroken from missing her (which I did). I actually had some nagging chest pain and other symptoms that I kept putting off due to my hectic pace. With a family history of heart disease, I knew stress could be a factor in causing some valid cardiac concerns. After an unexpected ER visit and an overnight stay at the hospital to double check that running on emotional and physical \u201cempty\u201d hadn\u2019t caused me actual lasting damage (which thankfully it didn\u2019t), my trusted family doctor prescribed me something: some much-needed and ongoing self-care.\n\nAn offer I couldn't refuse\n\nConcerned about the compounding ramifications of my past few years of grief, a longtime client of mine presented a very generous offer. They booked a trip for me to get away from my busy agency and five kids over a long weekend. The condition? I needed to rest and recover for four days alone. The pragmatic side of me had avoided such luxuries of late because I have a second child beginning college next fall and self-care of this magnitude seemed frivolous to a working single mother. However, this kind gift and unusual opportunity was one that came at the most perfect time for me and I seized the moment. My kids were all in full support and some wonderful friends were more than happy to ensure my children were well cared for during my retreat.\n\nI packed 12 self-help books (that I wanted to read but never could in my \u201creal\u201d life), several swimsuits, some work out attire and definitely no makeup or stilettos and began my mini self-discovery trip.\n\nUpon landing in Scottsdale, Arizona, I headed to a place called Sanctuary at Camelback Mountain. I was immediately transfixed by the hot dry air, the bright blue skies, cacti and vivid florals in every direction. I immediately felt myself exhaling for probably the first time in three long years of loss. In reflecting back about that first day, I had some anxiety and trepidation about my ability to just completely turn my brain off. Could I possibly like being by myself? In my entire life, I had never traveled for pleasure or self-care alone. I always had a spouse or children tagging along so this was quite foreign to me. The first night I was alone, I got a bit panicky. I texted a close girlfriend and told her I wasn\u2019t sure I was cut out for solo vacationing. Her advice? She asked me what I would have been doing anyway that night if I\u2019d been back at home in Chicago. I answered: likely watching a show on Netflix or reading. So, she said, get over myself and do it there. And that\u2019s just what I did. I embraced her candidness and took a bath and watched TV in the tub and smiled. Maybe this wasn\u2019t half bad?\n\nComing back to life\n\nOver the next several days, I began to notice myself coming to life again in a way I hadn\u2019t in a long, long time. I started just being very grateful to be in a quiet, beautiful place. I ate delicious healthy breakfasts each day. I embraced (and somewhat feared) hiking up a mountain with a guide who kept me from falling over the edge and well-hydrated in the 100-degree heat. I read four (yes four!) books during the trip. I tried an aerial yoga class that sounded fun and different to me (let\u2019s just say P!NK does it better than I do!). I meditated and prayed. I became my own favorite companion. It was incredibly freeing and just what I needed after my losses and busy life.\n\nAs I was flying home, I began to create a list on my iPhone (I\u2019m still type A when relaxed) and began to make personal commitments to myself. I would get more rest, I would exercise more, I would eat healthier foods. So what was top of the list, you ask? I would invest in myself and always plan to take a me-cation each year. I found that after my inaugural trip, I was more relaxed, reflective and inspired which has helped me immensely.\n\nA 'me-cation' with lasting effects\n\nIn fact, in the month or two since returning, I have found myself being so much more peaceful and balanced in work and life. I have also had a renewed energy and joy about me that others are noticing both in photos and when they see me out and about. Considering a solo trip? I\u2019d like to offer the following tips to anyone who has experienced loss, deals with anxiety or just has a stressful life like me:\n\nDon't feel guilty. Of course my first reaction to the suggestion of my trip to Arizona was to say a firm no due to my responsibilities to my children and my employees. Guess what? Everyone was not only happy to help but admitted I needed to go. That gave me the self-permission to accept a blessing and just go enjoy myself.\n\nOf course my first reaction to the suggestion of my trip to Arizona was to say a firm no due to my responsibilities to my children and my employees. Guess what? Everyone was not only happy to help but admitted I needed to go. That gave me the self-permission to accept a blessing and just go enjoy myself. Document the journey.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Erik Ortiz and Kurt Chirbas\n\nA \"feel-good story\" that grabbed national attention when a New Jersey couple raised more than $400,000 to help a homeless good Samaritan was built on greed and deception \u2014 and all three were in on the scam, prosecutors said Thursday.\n\nThe couple \u2014 Mark D'Amico, 39, and Kate McClure, 28 \u2014 and homeless man Johnny Bobbitt Jr., 35, were charged with second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception for cooking up a ploy to dupe people out of their donations, authorities said. If found guilty, they could serve up to five to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn November 2017, prosecutors allege, D'Amico and McClure concocted a GoFundMe campaign in honor of Bobbitt, whom they hailed for supposedly handing over a fistful of cash to McClure when he found her stranded on the side of the road in need of gas. The trio manufactured a get-rich-quick scheme \u2014 one that turned into a cautionary tale for the internet age as unsuspecting benefactors were \"hoodwinked,\" said Scott Coffina, the prosecutor in Burlington County, New Jersey.\n\n\"The entire campaign was predicated on a lie,\" Coffina said at a news conference, adding that less than an hour after the campaign went live, McClure texted a friend.\n\n\"'Okay so wait the gas part is completely made up ... But the guy isn't,'\" Coffina said, reading McClure's text. \"'I had to make something up to make people feel bad ... So, shush about the made up part.'\"\n\nJohnny Bobbitt Jr., left, Kate McClure, right, and McClure's boyfriend Mark D'Amico, center, at a Citgo gas station in Philadelphia on Nov. 17, 2017. Elizabeth Robertson / The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP file\n\nThe couple first started running into Bobbitt at a freeway ramp near a casino in Philadelphia they frequented about a month before McClure supposedly met him. They befriended him with money and coffee, and eventually hatched their plan, Coffina said.\n\nHe added that he believed Bobbitt was a veteran and homeless, but equally complicit in the ruse.\n\nProsecutors wouldn't say how much of a cut Bobbitt was supposed to receive, but within a few months of the campaign's creation, all of the money had been spent.\n\nUltimately, it was their public squabble over the donations this summer \u2014 Bobbitt accused D'Amico and McClure of withholding most of the GoFundMe money he was owed \u2014 that led authorities to investigate the case. The original tale then unraveled.\n\nThe story was \"too good to be true,\" Coffina said.\n\nD'Amico and McClure surrendered to authorities on Wednesday in Burlington County, where they live.\n\nPolice in Philadelphia also arrested Bobbitt on Wednesday and said he was considered a fugitive of justice from Burlington County in connection with the case. He could be extradited to New Jersey; a court date has not been set.\n\nErnest Badway, an attorney for D'Amico and McClure, told NBC News he had no comment early Thursday.\n\nAn attorney for Bobbitt did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nIn the initial GoFundMe campaign, D'Amico shared a picture she had taken with Bobbitt and claimed the story unfolded this way: Bobbitt, a homeless Marine veteran, had given her his last $20 after she ran out of gas on a freeway ramp in Philadelphia. Moved by the gesture, McClure and D'Amico started the fundraiser.\n\n\"Johnny did not ask me for a dollar, and I couldn't repay him at that moment because I didn't have any cash, but I have been stopping by his spot for the past few weeks,\" McClure wrote in her post.\n\nWANT BREAKING ALERTS FROM NBC NEWS? SIGN UP HERE\n\nBobbitt's kindness drew donations from more than 14,000 people and earned him $402,000. The outpouring, in turn, touched the couple, who had gone on a media blitz and were praised for \"paying it forward.\"\n\n\"[Bobbitt] will never have to worry about a roof over his head again!!\" they later posted on GoFundMe while thanking \"everyone who had a part of this amazing ride.\"\n\nBut Bobbitt believed the couple was dipping into some of the money for themselves, and in late August, attorneys for him filed a lawsuit to try to force McClure, a receptionist for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and D'Amico, a carpenter, to turn over the remaining cash.\n\nBobbitt's attorneys said he only received $75,000 of the money raised and claim the couple spent the donations on items such as a BMW and on luxury vacations to Florida and Las Vegas.\n\nThe couple denied the allegations and said they had withheld some of the money because they feared Bobbitt, who has battled a drug addiction, would spend it on drugs.\n\nCoffina said that more than 60,000 messages between McClure and D'Amico were seized from their iPhones detailing their financial woes, including bills and debts, and how they began thinking of Bobbitt when the idea of the hoax first took root.\n\nWhen asked if Bobbitt had realized that by suing D'Amico and McClure, their money-hungry hustle would likely get exposed, Coffina said he \"can't speculate what is in Johnny Bobbitt's mind.\"\n\n\"It certainly appears to have been a miscalculation on his part in hindsight,\" he added.\n\nIn September, GoFundMe promised Bobbitt that he would receive the rest of the money owed to him. It was unclear Thursday if the fundraising site had already provided it to him, but a spokesman said all donors will be given a full refund.\n\n\"We are fully cooperating and assisting law enforcement officials to recover every dollar withdrawn by Ms. McClure and Mr. D'Amico,\" GoFundMe said in a statement. \"Finally, it's important to understand that misuse is very rare on our platform.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Vaughn Hillyard", "title": "Second Trump-Kim summit to go forward without list of nuclear weapons, Pence says", "description": "The U.S. will not require North Korea to provide a list of its nuclear weapons and missile sites before a second summit between President Donald Trump and the North\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/second-trump-kim-summit-go-ahead-without-list-nuclear-north-n936481", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2647076/181115-kim-trump-mc-1006_9ed94a380ee668130090dac3ee7302c2.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T11:15:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The Kim regime has refused to provide the details of the country\u2019s operations and postponed scheduled meetings with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York City last week.\n\nVice President Mike Pence poses for a photo with ASEAN leaders in Singapore on Thursday. Edgar Su / Reuters\n\nThe second Trump-Kim meeting, slated for after the New Year, will be where a \"verifiable plan\" to disclose the sites and weapons must be reached, Pence said.\n\n\"Now we need to see results,\" he added during a wide-ranging interview that also touched on special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russia's alleged meddling and the vice president's conversation with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cI think it will be absolutely imperative in this next summit that we come away with a plan for identifying all of the weapons in question, identifying all the development sites, allowing for inspections of the sites and the plan for dismantling nuclear weapons,\u201d\n\nThis week, a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies outlined a number of missile operating bases that the North Koreans have continued to develop since the Trump-Kim summit five months ago.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t negotiate over things they don\u2019t admit having,\u201d said Victor Cha, one of the authors of the report. \u201cIt should take us back to the initial U.S. negotiating point: We need a full declaration.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of a meeting of Asian leaders in Singapore, Pence said, \"Everything begins with relationships, but now we need to see results.\n\nHe added that there had been \u201ctremendous progress\u201d in negotiations thus far \u2014 namely North Korea\u2019s stoppage of missile testing and the return of U.S. hostages and the possible remains of American service members in the Korean War.\n\nThe U.S. will maintain its hardline pressure on North Korea by not lifting its sanctions, Pence added.\n\n\u201cUntil we have a plan that is implemented to achieve complete, verifiable, irreversible, denuclearization, we're going to keep the pressure on,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore his interview with NBC News, Pence left a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has called on the U.S. to sign onto a peace treaty that would end the Korean War. The Trump administration has not indicated that it would make that agreement before lifting sanctions on North Korea.\n\nPence used the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit to raise the issue of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. election directly with President Putin, his office said.\n\nThe conversation took place during his third interaction with the Russian leader over a 24-hour period. Pence and Putin shared a table at a dinner the night prior but only exchanged \u201cgreetings,\u201d Pence said. He stood next to Putin for two minutes at an afternoon session as the Russian president engaged in conversation with National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe vice president also weighed in on special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russia's alleged meddling.\n\n\"I think the people can be confident that we will continue to cooperate,\" Pence said when asked if the American public should be concerned about the investigation coming to an end.\n\nPence added that the administration had sent over a million documents to the special counsel so far. Earlier this month Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the investigation, and named Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general. Whitaker was previously critical of the Russia investigation, but will now oversee Mueller.\n\nTrump later slammed the special counsel investigation, tweeting it was a \"total mess\" that has \"gone absolutely nuts.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters, Associated Press", "title": "Saudi prosecutor seeks death penalty for suspects in Khashoggi's killing", "description": "Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor is recommending the death penalty for five suspects charged with ordering and carrying out the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/saudi-prosecutor-seeks-death-penalty-suspects-khashoggi-s-killing-n936496", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2647151/181115-jamal-khashoggi-mc-11192_85d2eb7a224e8ae5b34caf9f3fd23daa.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T11:06:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Mohammed Muslemany and Saphora Smith\n\nCAIRO \u2014 The U.S. on Thursday announced sanctions against 17 Saudi Arabian officials over the killing of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe news followed Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor recommending the death penalty for five suspects in the murder of the former regime insider who became a critic of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe U.S. sanctions fall under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act that allows the government to target perpetrators of human rights violations with sanctions, and will block any property or interests in property the individuals have within or transiting U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nAmong those sanctioned are Saud al-Qahtani, who as a senior Saudi government official went on record saying he never acts without the direct approval of Prince Mohammed; Maher Mutreb, al-Qahtani\u2019s subordinate and Saudi Consul General Mohammed Alotaibi.\n\nAl-Qahtani was part of the planning and execution of the operation that led to the killing of Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the U.S. treasury department said in a statement. The operation was then coordinated and executed by Mutreb, it added.\n\n\u201cThe Saudi officials we are sanctioning were involved in the abhorrent killing of Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement. \u201cThese individuals who targeted and brutally killed a journalist who resided and worked in the United States must face consequences for their actions.\u201d\n\nEarlier, prosecutor Saud Al-Mojeb told journalists that 21 suspects had been arrested in connection with the case, of which 11 were charged with his killing.\n\nIn comments carried live on Saudi television, he said five suspects had confessed to the murder and recommended they be sentenced to death. Al-Mojeb added the court would continue its investigation into the other suspects.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Amir Levy / Reuters file\n\nKhashoggi was killed after he entered the consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.\n\nU.S. officials have said they take the journalist's death \u201cvery seriously\u201d and pledged to get to the bottom of what happened inside the consulate, while at the same time stressing what they say is Saudi Arabia\u2019s key role on combating terrorism and fighting Iran's influence in the Middle East.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also said he does not want to imperil a \"tremendous order\" of $110 billion of weapons he says will support 500,000 U.S. jobs \u2014 figures that experts say are highly exaggerated. Khashoggi's death intensified pressure on the White House's close relationship with Trump, who chose the kingdom as his first visit abroad.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions announced Thursday were \"an important step in responding to Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\"\n\n\"The State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts, consult Congress, and work with other nations to hold accountable those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi,\" he said.\n\nTurkey's foreign minister responded to the Saudi prosecutor's announcement by saying the measures fell short of Turkey's expectations.\n\nMevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said Ankara wants Riyadh to say who ordered the killing. Turkish officials, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have also demanded on several occasions that the suspects in the killing be tried in Turkey.\n\n\"I want to say that we did not find some of his explanations to be satisfactory,\" \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said. \"Those who gave the order, the real perpetrators need to be revealed. This process cannot be closed down in this way.\"\n\nTurkey has blamed the highest ranks of power in Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi's brutal death, saying the kingdom sent an assassination squad for him.\n\nAhmed al-Assiri Fayez Nureldine / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nAl-Mojeb said the plan to return Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia had been orchestrated by the deputy former head of the kingdom\u2019s intelligence services, Ahmad al-Assiri.\n\nAssiri is believed to have been a close confidant of the crown prince, and was fired for ordering Khashoggi's return. Al-Assiri was not among those sanctioned by the U.S.\n\nAl-Qahtani \u2014 who is among those sanctioned \u2014 is also accused of planning and ordering Khashoggi's forced return to the kingdom, according to the AP.\n\nProsecutors say the two men formed a 15-man Saudi team to carry out the operation, the news agency reported. Saudi prosecutors said the men deemed Khashoggi a threat because of his work as a writer and because he was allegedly backed by groups and countries that are hostile to Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, they stopped short of accusing al-Assiri or al-Qahtani of ordering the killing itself.\n\nAccording to the prosecutor, a plot was hatched on Sept. 29 \u2014 three days before the journalist\u2019s disappearance \u2014 for the team to kill Khashoggi if negotiators failed to persuade him to return home.\n\nAl-Mojeb said Khashoggi was killed by a lethal injection of narcotics. He said that the injection was administered after a quarrel broke out and Khashoggi was restrained.\n\nHis killers then dismembered the body and removed it from the consulate, he added.\n\nAmong the other details confirmed during the press briefing was that the consulate cameras had been disabled ahead of the attack.\n\nWhile the kingdom is considered a linchpin of Trump's regional ambitions, the Khashoggi crisis has helped crystallize growing unease about Prince Mohammed.\n\nThe Saudis have repeatedly denied that the prince had prior knowledge of the plot.\n\nIn a televised press conference held later Thursday, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister re-emphasized that Prince Mohammed had \"nothing to do\" with Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\u201cThis was individuals exceeding their authority and going beyond their mandate,\u201d he said. \u201cThese individuals made a tremendous mistake and for this mistake they will pay a price.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, National Security Adviser John Bolton said people who have listened to an audio recording of what happened to Khashoggi do not think it implicates Prince Salman in his death.\n\n\"That is not the conclusion that the people who have heard it have come to,\" Bolton told reporters at a summit in Singapore.\n\nMohammed Muslemany reported from Cairo; Saphora Smith from London; and Abigail Williams from Washington."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Man finds engagement ring among ruins of childhood home", "description": "Nick Maes returned to the ruins of his childhood home in Paradise, California, to search for the ring he planned to give his girlfriend.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/man-finds-engagement-ring-among-ruins-of-childhood-home-1371161155755", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/nc_kcra_ring_181114__011878.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T07:34:50Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Man finds engagement ring among ruins of childhood home copied!\n\nNick Maes returned to the ruins of his childhood home in Paradise, California, to search for the ring he planned to give his girlfriend.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Pence: \u2018Now we need to see results\u2019 on North Korea denuclearization", "description": "NBC\u2019s Vaughn Hillyard speaks with Vice President Pence about negotiations with North Korea, the trade standoff with China and the naming of Matt Whitaker as the acting attorney general to replace Jeff Sessions.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/pence-now-we-need-to-see-results-on-north-korea-denuclearization-1371122243957", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/f_mo_la_vhi_pence_full_181114__764361.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T06:35:25Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Pence: \u2018Now we need to see results\u2019 on North Korea denuclearization copied!\n\nNBC\u2019s Vaughn Hillyard speaks with Vice President Pence about negotiations with North Korea, the trade standoff with China and the naming of Matt Whitaker as the acting attorney general to replace Jeff Sessions.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dennis Romero and Jareen Imam and Stephan Kozub", "title": "Deadly California fire could worsen homeless crisis", "description": "Amid California's housing crisis, a deadly fire in Butte County has displaced thousands of people, some of whom could end up chronically homeless.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deadly-california-fire-could-worsen-state-s-homeless-crisis-n936461", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2646896/181114-chico-temporary-shelter-camp-fire-aftermath-ac-744p_7eb2737dc46484aed9da94b8cfd45bc0.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T05:45:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Now that we\u2019ve lost all these homes in Paradise, there are going to be more people struggling to find a place to live.\"\n\nDespite the reality that about one in five Californians live in poverty, the median home value in the state is $544,900, and the median two-bedroom rent is $2,750, according to real estate listings site Zillow.\n\nBefore the fire started Nov. 8, thousands of lower-income workers and retirees took refuge in Paradise, where the median home price is $200,900, according to the U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\n\u201cParadise is not the richest of towns,\u201d said evacuee Danie Schwartz, whose home was spared. \u201cI am from Southern California, which is also ablaze, but it\u2019s like people who are worried about their beach homes burning, the circumstances are a bit different for those people compared to the ones in Paradise.\n\n\"People in Paradise don\u2019t have the means to get out of town,\" she continued. \"People are stuck at evacuation shelters.\u201d\n\nEvacuees have been setting up tents in parking lots, including at a Chico Walmart, while others are sleeping in cars or staying with family.

Narad, operations manager of Chico\u2019s Safe Space Winter Shelter Program, which adds 60 beds to the city\u2019s shelter inventory for 12 weeks starting in mid-December, said that last year the program was \"turning people away every night.\"\n\n\"We already had a housing shortage in the county,\" he said. \"We expect some people will end up on the street.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Phil McCausland\n\nA House committee will hear testimony Thursday from Department of Veterans Affairs officials over delayed GI Bill payments potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of veterans. NBC News reported Sunday that computer problems at VA have caused GI Bill benefit payments covering education and housing to be delayed for months or never be delivered, forcing some veterans to face debt or even homelessness.\n\nOn Wednesday, one of the key witnesses called to testify from VA was reassigned by the federal agency to a regional office in Houston, multiple officials told NBC News.\n\nRobert Worley, executive director of Education Service of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), based in Washington, has been appointed to serve as the executive director of the VBA\u2019s Houston regional office, according to two sources close to the VA and an email reviewed by NBC News.\n\nMolly Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, confirmed Thursday that Worley would be departing his current position to lead the VBA office in Houston.\n\nRobert M. Worley II, Director of Education Service Veterans Benefits Administration. U.S. Air Force\n\nHigher-ups at VA decided to reassign Worley due to the delayed GI Bill payments, as well as other issues within his office, sources said. Worley was told that he could choose which of VBA\u2019s 52 regional offices he would lead, but that he had to leave his current position.\n\nThe VA is expected to say that Worley is leaving his current position because he wants to spend more time in the field, sources said, but the move comes amid ongoing issues around GI Bill benefit payments. Thursday's House Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing is an attempt to hold VA accountable for the delayed payments to veterans, they added.\n\nWorley's departure is believed to provide VA leadership an out at the hearing.\n\n\u201cIt allows him to take a bullet [at the committee hearing] for the undersecretary,\u201d one former VA official said.\n\nVA Undersecretary for Benefits Dr. Paul Lawrence will testify at the hearing on Thursday afternoon. Bill James and John Galvin, both from VA's Office of Information & Technology, are expected to testify as well. Richard Crowe, the senior vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton, the information technology contractor who worked on the Forever GI Bill with VA will also testify.\n\nThe announcement of Worley's move was made internally on Friday. VA and Worley did not respond to NBC News' request for comment.\n\nWorley had been in his current position as the director of education service since March 2012. Prior to coming to VBA, Worley retired from the Air Force as a major general.\n\nService organizations that advocate for veterans in Washington said that they are concerned that Worley\u2019s departure will negatively affect their ability to promote veterans issues.\n\nPatrick Murray, deputy director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that he did not know of Worley's upcoming departure but the VFW had a good working relationship with him. They could easily call him about problems that they were seeing, he said.\n\n\"It sounds like another change in leadership,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThe honest truth is that we could get someone in that we don\u2019t have a good relationship with and that\u2019s a legitimate fear. Constant turnover is not great.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Senate is also taking a deeper look at the problems VA is facing.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Patty Murray, Richard Blumenthal, Michael Bennet, Sherrod Brown and Debbie Stabenow wrote a letter to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie on Tuesday in response to reports of the ongoing computer issues at VA that delayed GI Bill benefit payments.\n\n\"As a nation we have a responsibility to be there for our veterans, and part of that duty involves fulfilling our promise to ensure they have access to education after they leave the service,\" the letter said. \"These errors and delays undermine the intent of the GI Bill and put unnecessary and avoidable strain on veterans and their families during a critical time of transition.\"\n\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., responds to a reporter's question on Capitol Hill on Oct. 3, 2018 in Washington. Alex Brandon / AP file\n\nThe letter asked for the VA secretary to provide an updated number of affected veterans, average wait time for payments, the number of full-time and contract employees working to fix the technology error, how much the extra work will cost, when the VA learned of the error and the steps it is taking to ensure these types of issues don\u2019t happen again.\n\nDemocrats requested in the letter that VA provide updates every two weeks until the problem is resolved.\n\nMurray, D-Wash., who led the minority effort to write the letter to Wilkie, said that veterans should not have to wait to receive the benefits that are supposed to help them transition into civilian life.\n\n\u201cI expect VA to work as urgently as possible to honor its commitment to our veterans and process all backlogged housing stipend and tuition payments \u2014 and many of us in Congress will be watching closely to ensure they make this right for the thousands of veterans waiting desperately for relief,\u201d the senator wrote."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Alex Johnson, Vivian Kim", "title": "Death toll rises to 56 in Northern California's Camp Fire", "description": "Authorities released a list of 101 people still unaccounted for \u2014 and they said that's only a partial list.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/death-toll-rises-56-northern-california-s-camp-fire-n936466", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2646601/ss-181114-california-wildfires-update-05_f3d2eb792fb8911e95f10c0b5cbd8670.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T02:35:00Z", "content": "Brown described the scene as a \"war zone,\" saying, \"This is so devastating that I don't really have the words to describe it.\" Brown said President Donald Trump, with whom he has often clashed, called him on Wednesday to offer his full support. \"We're in a di\u2026 [+1530 chars]", "fulltext": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The winning bid from the Virginia Economic Development Project also offered to alert Amazon anytime a public records request was filed in relation to the company\u2019s agreement with the VEDP \u201cto allow the company to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy,\u201d and \u201climit disclosure, refuse to disclose, and redact and/or omit portions of materials to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the smaller incentives, Amazon is expected to reap more than $2 billion in tax incentives between the two projections.\n\nOutside of tax breaks, cities on the losing end included a wide variety of freebies and hooks in their bids, as The Huffington Post pointed out.\n\nDallas and Atlanta offered some of the most notable perks, particularly with regards to making transportation easier for Amazon employees.\n\nThe city of Atlanta\u2019s proposal offered Amazon executives 50 free parking spots and an \u201cexclusive lounge\u201d at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the busiest airport in the U.S. Dallas proposed a $25 million dollar \u201cbuild-to-suit corporate hanger for Amazon\u201d at Dallas Executive Airport, along with access to Hensley Field, a former U.S. Navy aviation base, for Amazon to test \u201cresearch innovations.\u201d\n\nAtlanta also offered an Amazon-dedicated train on its rail system \u201cto distribute products,\u201d and Dallas included $1.5 million dollars \u201ctoward shuttles, pedicabs, courtesy carts, or other quick transit solutions for HQ2 employees\u201d in Dallas and a promise to \u201cwork with you on longer term transit options.\u201d\n\nOther cities offered a chance for Amazon to have a say in how its tax dollars would be spent. The mayor of the city of Fresno, Lee Brand, proposed an \u201cAmazon Community Fund\u201d to be \u201cjointly controlled and administered by a committee of City leaders and Amazon executives.\u201d\n\nNot all cities offered up strange and exotic perks. Reviews of bids from Toronto and Denver did not turn up much aside from the usual tax and community business incentives.\n\nSome perks were focused on making life a little better for Amazon employees. Dallas promised \u201ca free one-year membership to each of the following City amenities: Dallas Zoo, Dallas Children's Aquarium, Dallas Arboretum, Texas Discovery Gardens, and the Trinity River Audubon Center\u201d for each employee hired by Amazon from 2019-2021. The Dallas Animal Services adoption center pledged to waive pet adoption fees and offer free microchipping service until 2022 to all \u201cAmazon pets.\u201d\n\nBid sweeteners also aimed to give Amazon employees an advantageous position in the community. Boston\u2019s bid proposed a connection to the city\u2019s \u201cBuy in Boston Program,\u201d which would have offered 0 percent interest rates to eligible Amazon employees interested in purchasing homes, as well as a \u201cbest-in-class discount program\u201d for Amazon employees\u2019 flying JetBlue for corporate travel.\n\nAnd some bidders were willing to change their own city\u2019s name to appeal to the needs of the tech giant. Stonecrest, a town in Georgia, pledged the city would rename itself as \u201cAmazon City\u201d if the tech giant chose it as the location for the new headquarters. In a less obvious approach, the winning bid in Virginia included the new name of \u201cNational Landing\u201d for the development area, which came as a surprise to area residents.\n\nNone of them, however, quite compared to Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, who joked that he may change his own name.\n\n\"I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes\" Cuomo said last Monday. \u201cBecause it would be a great economic boost.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Under Ben Carson, more families live in HUD housing that fails health and safety inspections", "description": "While HUD Secretary Ben Carson pledged to fix low-income housing, the number of properties cited for health and safety violations has been on the rise.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/under-ben-carson-more-families-live-in-hud-housing-that-fails-health-and-safety-inspections-1370866243950", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/nn_sgo_nbc_news_hud_investigation_181114_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:55:47Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Under Ben Carson, more families live in HUD housing that fails health and safety inspections copied!\n\nWhile HUD Secretary Ben Carson pledged to fix low-income housing, the number of properties cited for health and safety violations has been on the rise.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Chris Fuchs", "title": "Former Obama aide, Andy Kim, unseats GOP Rep.

MacArthur, an ally of President Donald Trump who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare, garnered 48.8 percent of the vote for the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, which he has represented since 2015.\n\nMacArthur made headlines last year, following an unsuccessful attempt by Republicans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, when he authored an amendment that breathed new life into the effort.\n\nThe \u201cMacArthur amendment\u201d would have let states obtain waivers to allow insurers to charge some people more, including those with pre-existing conditions and those who are less healthy.

The last one to serve was Jay Kim, a Republican who represented California in the House of Representatives from 1993 to 1999. One other race featuring a Korean American, Young Kim in California's 39th Congressional District, remains too close to call.\n\nJay Kim made history himself as the first Korean American ever elected to Congress. But he left in 1999, losing a primary the year before amid a campaign contributions scandal. He ran again in 2000 for a House seat neighboring his old district, but lost that primary as well.\n\nWhile Korean Americans have found success over the past few decades in being elected to local and state office, winning a congressional seat has proved elusive \u2014 until now.\n\nRunning in the South Jersey district where he grew up, Democrat and congressman-elect Andy Kim, 36, launched his bid for the House following a career in public service.\n\n\u201cSeptember 11th happened during my time in college,\u201d Andy Kim said in an interview this past summer. \u201cAnd that was really something that had motivated and pushed me and many in my generation to think about ways in which we can be of service.\u201d\n\nA Rhodes Scholar with a doctorate in international relations from the University of Oxford, Andy Kim worked in Afghanistan as an adviser to Gens. David Petraeus and John Allen. He also worked for the White House as the director of Iraq at the National Security Council.\n\nAndy Kim\u2019s former boss, President Barack Obama, and the Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders Rising & Empowering Political Action Committee (ASPIRE PAC) both endorsed him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s someone who obviously has a very qualified background,\u201d ASPIRE PAC chair Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said in a phone interview this summer. \u201cHe\u2019s impressive no matter how you slice it,\u201d she added.\n\nThe midterm elections, which saw Democrats regaining control of the House, saw historic wins with included a record number of women winning their races, according to NBC News.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Chris Fuchs\n\nDemocrat Andy Kim has defeated Republican incumbent Tom MacArthur in a race to represent New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District, NBC News projected Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis campaign was never about the politics; it was always about the people of New Jersey and who would best advocate for the hopes and needs of our community in Washington,\u201d Kim said in a media release Wednesday. \u201cOur campaign was about the issues \u2014 about affordable health care for all Americans; about fair taxes for New Jersey families; and about a government that works for the people. I look forward to working on these and other key issues while representing my home district with integrity and civility in Washington.\u201d\n\nKim had initially declared victory on the night of Nov. 7, but the race remained too close to call at the time.\n\nKim won 49.9 percent of the vote as of Wednesday. MacArthur, an ally of President Donald Trump who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare, garnered 48.8 percent of the vote for the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, which he has represented since 2015.\n\nMacArthur made headlines last year, following an unsuccessful attempt by Republicans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, when he authored an amendment that breathed new life into the effort.\n\nThe \u201cMacArthur amendment\u201d would have let states obtain waivers to allow insurers to charge some people more, including those with pre-existing conditions and those who are less healthy. MacArthur\u2019s measure didn\u2019t sit well with some voters in his district.\n\nKim's victory will also mark the first time in over 20 years that a Korean American has been elected to Congress. The last one to serve was Jay Kim, a Republican who represented California in the House of Representatives from 1993 to 1999. One other race featuring a Korean American, Young Kim in California's 39th Congressional District, remains too close to call.\n\nJay Kim made history himself as the first Korean American ever elected to Congress. But he left in 1999, losing a primary the year before amid a campaign contributions scandal. He ran again in 2000 for a House seat neighboring his old district, but lost that primary as well.\n\nWhile Korean Americans have found success over the past few decades in being elected to local and state office, winning a congressional seat has proved elusive \u2014 until now.\n\nRunning in the South Jersey district where he grew up, Democrat and congressman-elect Andy Kim, 36, launched his bid for the House following a career in public service.\n\n\u201cSeptember 11th happened during my time in college,\u201d Andy Kim said in an interview this past summer. \u201cAnd that was really something that had motivated and pushed me and many in my generation to think about ways in which we can be of service.\u201d\n\nA Rhodes Scholar with a doctorate in international relations from the University of Oxford, Andy Kim worked in Afghanistan as an adviser to Gens. David Petraeus and John Allen. He also worked for the White House as the director of Iraq at the National Security Council.\n\nAndy Kim\u2019s former boss, President Barack Obama, and the Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders Rising & Empowering Political Action Committee (ASPIRE PAC) both endorsed him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s someone who obviously has a very qualified background,\u201d ASPIRE PAC chair Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said in a phone interview this summer. \u201cHe\u2019s impressive no matter how you slice it,\u201d she added.\n\nThe midterm elections, which saw Democrats regaining control of the House, saw historic wins with included a record number of women winning their races, according to NBC News. There were also major firsts, including the first Muslim women and the first Native American woman to be elected to Congress.\n\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Under Ben Carson, more families live in HUD housing that fails health and safety inspections", "description": "While HUD Secretary Ben Carson pledged to fix low-income housing, the number of properties cited for health and safety violations has been on the rise.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/under-ben-carson-more-families-live-in-hud-housing-that-fails-health-and-safety-inspections-1370827843826", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/nn_sgo_nbc_news_hud_investigation_181114_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:17:10Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Under Ben Carson, more families live in HUD housing that fails health and safety inspections copied!\n\nWhile HUD Secretary Ben Carson pledged to fix low-income housing, the number of properties cited for health and safety violations has been on the rise.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Alex Johnson", "title": "U.S. could lose a war to Russia and China, report warns", "description": "The report concludes that the Defense Department isn't financially or strategically set up even to guarantee a victory against China or Russia individually.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-military-crisis-could-lose-war-russia-china-report-n936431", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_06/2321076/180208-us-strikes-mc-1227_6d4821f86976a34b0856a6c7216ca3a8.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:11:28Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Alex Johnson\n\nThe United States faces a \"crisis of national security\" because its historic military supremacy has eroded drastically, leaving it likely unable to fight more than a single war at a time, according to a congressionally chartered report released Wednesday.\n\n\"U.S. military superiority is no longer assured and the implications for American interests and American security are severe,\" said the report, which was issued by the National Defense Strategy Commission, an independent agency whose board is appointed by the House and Senate Armed Services committees.\n\nThe report concludes that the Defense Department isn't financially or strategically set up to wage two wars at once and could even lose a war against China or Russia individually.\n\n\"The U.S. military could suffer unacceptably high casualties and loss of major capital assets in its next conflict,\" it said.\n\nThe commission's co-chairmen \u2014 Eric Edelman, who was undersecretary of defense during the presidency of George W. Bush, and retired Adm. Gary Roughead, a former chief of naval operations bridging the Bush and Obama administrations \u2014 are scheduled to testify before both Armed Services committees later this month.\n\nJohnny Michael, a spokesman for the Defense Department, said the agency welcomed the report, calling it \"a stark reminder of the gravity of these issues, and a call to action.\"\n\n\"The department will carefully consider each of the recommendations put forward by the commission as part of continuing efforts to strengthen our nation's defense, and looks forward to working with the commission and the Congress to do so,\" he said.\n\nIn a post for the Atlantic Council, a nonprofit international affairs policy institute, Edelman wrote Wednesday that \"China and Russia, seeking regional hegemony and global power projection, are pursuing military buildups aimed at neutralizing U.S. strengths,\n\n'The United States has significantly weakened its own defense due to political dysfunction and decisions made by both Republicans as well as Democrats,' wrote former Undersecretary of Defense Eric Edelman, the commission's co-chairman. Samuel Corum / Anadolu Agency/Getty Images file\n\nAt the same time, \"the United States has significantly weakened its own defense due to political dysfunction and decisions made by both Republicans as well as Democrats,\" he wrote, citing defense budget cuts \"with pronounced detrimental effects on the size, modernization, and readiness of the military.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump last week asked the Defense Department to cut $16 billion next year from its budget, which currently is at $716 billion \u2014 a 2\u00bc percent reduction.\n\n\"U.S. forces will need additional resources to train to high levels of proficiency across a broader and more technologically challenging range of potential missions than in the recent past, particularly those missions focusing on advanced military threats from China and Russia,\" the commission wrote.\n\nBut money isn't the only roadblock, it concluded.\n\nThe commission welcomed the National Defense Strategy (PDF), a summary of U.S. military goals that Defense Secretary James Mattis released in January.\n\nThe unclassified public version of the strategy document was widely criticized for being short on specifics, including force levels and cost, and the commission urged that more of it be declassified so it could be \"used as a benchmark for measuring implementation of the strategy.\"\n\nThe document \"points the Department of Defense and the country in the right direction,\" the commission said, but it \"does not adequately explain how we should get there.\"\n\nThe 116-page report identifies outer space and cyberspace as particular problem points, among many others.\n\n\"Because of our recent focus on counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency, and because our enemies have developed new ways of defeating U.S. forces, America is losing its advantage in key warfighting areas such as power projection, air and missile defense, cyber and space operations, anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare, long-range ground-based fires, and electronic warfare,\" it said.\n\n\"Many of the skills necessary to plan for and conduct military operations against capable adversaries \u2014 especially China and Russia \u2014 have atrophied.\"\n\nThe report closes with a jarring warning:\n\n\"The costs of failing to meet America\u2019s crisis of national defense and national security will not be measured in abstract concepts like 'international stability' and 'global order.' They will be measured in American lives, American treasure, and American security and prosperity lost. It will be a tragedy \u2014 of unforeseeable but perhaps tremendous magnitude \u2014 if the United States allows its national interests and national security to be compromised through an unwillingness or inability to make hard choices and necessary investments.\n\n\"That tragedy will be all the more regrettable because it is within our power to avoid it,\" the panel said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dareh Gregorian and Associated Press", "title": "Suspect in Ohio family murders appears in court", "description": "George 'Billy' Wagner III, who's charged along with his wife and two adult sons in the murders of an Ohio family, made a brief appearance in a Kentucky court.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/george-billy-wagner-suspect-ohio-family-murders-appears-court-n936301", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2644871/181113-pike-county-murder-arrests-ew-145p_882a6acabb46e24abf69473d65fe5d4a.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:01:32Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Dareh Gregorian\n\nOne of a family of suspects accused of executing eight members of another family on an Ohio marijuana farm is headed back to the Buckeye State.\n\nGeorge \"Billy\" Wagner III, 47, was hiding in a horse trailer outside of a veterinary hospital when he was arrested by police in Lexington, Kentucky, on Tuesday, LEX18 reported. He had reportedly taken a horse there for treatment.\n\nWagner's wife, Angela, 48, and their two adult sons, George Wagner IV, 27, and Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, 26, were also arrested around the same time in Ohio for the shocking murders.\n\nThe patriarch appeared in a district court in Lexington, where he was asked what he wanted to do about extradition. \"I guess head back to Ohio,\" he answered, according to WCPO.\n\nCourt appearances for the four Wagner family members are pending. Officials say they need lawyers who are eligible to handle death penalty cases. All four are charged with eight counts of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications for the April 22, 2016, slayings of members of the Rhoden family on their farm.\n\nCourt papers say the four went to different homes on the Rhodens' land, shooting their victims - whose ages ranged from 16 to 44 - multiple times.\n\nOhio State Attorney General Mike DeWine said the motive involved a custody dispute between Jake Wagner and one of the victims, Hanna Rhoden, 19. The two had a 2-year-old daughter together, and Rhoden had given birth to another girl just five days before her murder.\n\nThat baby was lying next to Hanna Rhoden when the mother was shot twice in the head.\n\nJake Wagner told the Cincinnati Enquirer in June 2016 that there was a \"50/50 chance\" that the newborn was his as well, and that the baby should be raised with her older sister. Paternity tests later showed he was not the father.\n\nThe daughter that was Wagner's, Sophia \u2014 now 5 \u2014 was staying with the Wagner family on the night of the Rhoden murders, per the terms of a custody agreement. Sophia lived with the Wagners full-time after the slayings.\n\nA Rhoden relative, Sophia's great-grandfather, Leonard Manley, told the Enquirer that Sophia is safe and in state custody.\n\nThe murders stunned rural Pike County \u2014 as did the Wagners' arrests. DeWine noted the families had been friends for years, and Angela Wagner had once described Hanna Rhoden as \"like a daughter\" to her.\n\nDeWine said the Wagners used their familiarity with the other family, including their security systems and their pets, to plot their deaths.\n\n\"It is our belief that the suspects used this knowledge to meticulously plan these horrendous, cold-blooded murders,\" DeWine said Tuesday.\n\nThe indictments said the Wagner family bought ammunition, a magazine clip and a device called a brass catcher to catch spent cartridge casings. Authorities said they also had a homemade silencer.\n\nThey're also accused of tampering with the Rhodens' phones and security systems and forging custody documents.\n\nJake Wagner was hit with an additional charge of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for having sexual contact with Hanna Rhoden when she was 15 and he was 20.\n\nLawyer John Kearson Clark Jr., who represented the Wagners before their arrests, said in a statement to WCMH:\"We look forward to the day when the true culprits will be discovered and brought to justice for this terrible tragedy.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Twin doctors hope to change the face of medicine", "description": "Twin sisters Brittani and Brandi Jackson grew up as star students in Twinsburg, Ohio, but realized there weren\u2019t many doctors who looked like them.
