I have had this lunch box for almost a week now and I have jam packed it to the max. Very well-made material and also keeps my food very cold when I have ice packs in it. Yesterday I came home from work at 4 p.m. and totally forgot to unpack my lunch box until later in the evening close to midnight. I was so impressed to see that everything in there was still super cold since I have had those ice packs in there since 7:30 a.m. that morning and I could feel how well the lunch box was keeping the cold inside. I also love the fact that when I shove like three meals in the bag when I'm working all day, carrying it is a breeze! It is so lightweight. The strap is awesome because it doesn\u2019t move or feel like it\u2019s going to fall off of your shoulder. This is important to me because I'm usually carrying multiple bags a day to work and it just makes my life a little easier! My only small complaint is that the drink holder in the side is not made well, I\u2019ve tried to put travel cups in there and they just end up falling out because it is simply not a deep enough pocket.

Preaque\u00e7a o forno a 220 \u00baC. Forre 2 assadeiras com papel-manteiga. Esfrie uma tigela grande no freezer.\n\n2. Coloque o chocolate derretido em um pequeno saco de confeitar ou saco pl\u00e1stico com fecho herm\u00e9tico e corte 3 mm da ponta do saco fora. Pegue o saco com o chocolate e fa\u00e7a 10 conjuntos de orelhas, olhos, narizes, bocas e patas em uma das assadeiras forradas com papel-manteiga. Deixe esfriando na geladeira at\u00e9 estar pronto para usar.\n\n3. Fa\u00e7a a massa: em uma panela m\u00e9dia, coloque a manteiga, a \u00e1gua, o leite, o a\u00e7\u00facar e o sal para ferver em fogo alto.\n\n4. Quando o l\u00edquido come\u00e7ar a ferver, retire a panela do fogo e adicione imediatamente a farinha, mexendo constantemente com uma colher de pau at\u00e9 que o l\u00edquido seja absorvido e a mistura comece a se parecer com uma bola.\n\n5. Retorne a panela ao fogo e cozinhe por mais 30 segundos para remover o excesso de umidade. Retire a panela do fogo. Rapidamente, coloque os ovos um de cada vez, mexendo at\u00e9 que cada um esteja totalmente incorporado antes de adicionar o pr\u00f3ximo. Continue mexendo at\u00e9 a massa come\u00e7ar a se soltar das laterais da panela e ficar espessa e brilhante. Coloque a massa em um saco de confeitar ou um saco com fecho herm\u00e9tico de ponta arredondada.\n\n7. Pegue o saco com a massa e, com movimentos circulares, fa\u00e7a bolinhas de 2 cm de massa na assadeira forrada, deixando 2 cm de espa\u00e7o entre elas.\n\n8. Mergulhe a ponta do dedo na \"egg wash\" e pressione suavemente todas as pontas das bolinhas, em seguida, d\u00ea uma leve pincelada com a \"egg wash\" por todas elas.\n\n9. Asse por 10 minutos. Reduza a temperatura do forno para 180 \u00b0C e deixe assando por mais 20 minutos, at\u00e9 dourar.\n\n10. Transfira a assadeira com as bolinhas para uma prateleira e deixe esfriando at\u00e9 que seja poss\u00edvel manipul\u00e1-las. Corte os topos (as pontas) das bolinhas com uma faca serrilhada. Deixe esfriar completamente.\n\n11. Fa\u00e7a o chantili: adicione o creme de leite e o a\u00e7\u00facar de confeiteiro na tigela gelada e bata com a batedeira el\u00e9trica ou com o batedor de claras at\u00e9 que fique consistente. Coloque o chantili em um saco de confeitar ou um saco com fecho herm\u00e9tico de ponta arredondada.\n\n12. Recheie as bolinhas com o chantili. Recoloque os topos das bolinhas e decore com as partes de chocolate.\n\n13.

Adicione a manteiga, cenoura, cebola, aipo, os 3 dentes de alho restantes, sal e pimenta \u00e0 panela e cozinhe at\u00e9 caramelizar, cerca de 5 minutos.\n\n8. Adicione o vinho branco e mexa para desprender os peda\u00e7os marrons que possam grudar no fundo da panela. Cozinhe at\u00e9 o vinho se reduzir e a panela ficar ligeiramente seca de novo.\n\n9. Adicione os tomates, folhas de louro, or\u00e9gano e pimenta vermelha em fotos, mexa para misturar.\n\n10. Ponha o bife de volta na panela. Tampe e cozinhe por 1 hora, virando o rolo na metade do cozimento (se o molho est\u00e1 secando muito, adicione mais polpa de tomate ou \u00e1gua), at\u00e9 a carne ficar macia.\n\n11. Fatie o bife a rol\u00ea e sirva em uma bandeja com o molho. Sirva o bife a rol\u00ea com macarr\u00e3o orecchiette ou polenta. Enfeite com queijo pecorino romano e manjeric\u00e3o fresco.\n\nBom apetite!\n\nInspirado por: https://www.foodnetwork.com/r"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Brittaney Trent", "title": "Just 20 Face Masks You'll Want To Try ASAP", "description": "Trust me, these are totally worth it!

Like many '90s girls, I was obsessed with The Baby-Sitters Club \u2013 the books, the TV show AND the movie. But it's been a very long time since I rewatched the movie \u2013 here's how the experience of revisiting it went down...\n\nBeacon Pictures\n\n1. This opening music is so ~funky~. 2. LISTEN PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, HO NA NA NA HEY. 3. I...didn\u2019t realise I still knew this off by heart. 4. The Baby-Sitters Club couldn\u2019t happen in 2018 because the whole premise hinges on the use of landline phones. 5. I remember being a kid and pretending I was in a movie as I got ready because all my fave movies seemed to open with people getting ready for the day. 6. When I was younger Kristy kind of annoyed me but I appreciate her a whole lot more now. 7. I always wanted to be a Claudia or Stacey but I\u2019m a total Mary Anne and that\u2019s okay. I adore her. 8. I\u2019m also a little bit of a Mallory but I\u2019d rather not talk about that. 9. \u201cLikes her? Or like likes her?\u201d That is such a tween vibe. 10. Oh wow I had Dawn\u2019s outfit head-to-toe. The long skirt, the denim vest. A look. 11. This cast is full of basically all of my \u201890s girl crushes. It\u2019s just missing Sarah Michelle Gellar and Reese Witherspoon. 12. \u201cI love little kids with accents!\u201d Hahahahahaha. Stacey is in for a shock.\n\nBeacon Pictures\n\n13. \u201cI thought you were going to the movies?\u201d \u201cI have my whole life to go to the movies.\u201d When I was 9 I thought that was the most romantic line in the world. 14. I just realised Luca is supposed to have a full-on European accent. Wow. It\u2019s bad. 15. \u201cIt\u2019s the best.\u201d \u201cDo you mean like you?\u201d I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. 16. Oh yeaaaah Stacey\u2019s diabetes is a ~big secret~. 17. Shiiiit now that I\u2019m a grown-ass adult, a 17-year-old dating a 13-year-old is even creepier than it was when I was younger. 18. \u201cHe\u2019s been to Europe.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s FROM Europe.\u201d Yeah, I love Kristy. 19. Ellen Burstyn! I forgot she was the grumpy neighbour lady. 20. Cokie Mason is such an icon. 21. I used to have the biggest crush on Austin O\u2019Brien. Mainly thanks to My Girl 2, but also Logan Bruno, of course. 22. Cokie definitely gets the best outfits. 23. Hahahahaha tricking Cokie and her minions into walking into a bunch of sprinklers is peak 13-year-old revenge. It\u2019s perfect. 24. I still don\u2019t understand how the adults of Stonybrook trusted a bunch of 13-year-olds (and 11-year-olds) to babysit their kids. Like, they\u2019re still actual children themselves. 25. Oh no I\u2019m so old I relate most to the neighbour who's irritated that a bunch of kids are making all this noise in her neighbourhood. 26. I feel like all this stuff for the summer camp would have cost them way more than the price of admission. 27. \u201cWe can\u2019t let men get away with everything.\u201d I LOVE KRISTY.\n\nBeacon Pictures\n\n28. Ugh. Kristy\u2019s dad. I hate him. 29. It\u2019s terrible that he forces Kristy to keep his presence a secret. Also, what about Kristy\u2019s brothers? Doesn\u2019t he want to see them? The whole situation is so weird. 30. \u201cIt\u2019s cowbody da\u2013 it\u2019s cowgirl- it\u2019s cowPEOPLE day!\u201d We stan a gender-inclusive queen. 31. A lot of the lines I thought were the HEIGHT of comedy as a kid have not held up very well. 32. Logan and Mary Anne are so cuuuuuute even though they definitely gave me unrealistic expectations of tween relationships. 33. Why do they all assume Kristy has a boyfriend when a an ADULT MAN with a beard and everything picks her up?!?! That\u2019s...not the most natural conclusion on any level. 34. \u201cI\u2019m writing a novel about the first nurse in America.\u201d Mallory, I\u2019m sorry I was every awful to you, I love you. 35. \u201cMallory, have you seen Dawn around?\u201d \u201cYeah, she\u2019s around.\u201d I LOVE HER. 36. \u201cIf we keep going we\u2019ll find it.\u201d \u201cFind what?\u201d \u201cHeaven.\u201d Oh my god Luca is the WORST. 37. I haaaaaate Kristy\u2019s dad so much. 38. Cokie saying \u201cI\u2019m trading you guys in\u201d to her friends is such a mood. 39. \u201cI promised Kristy.\u201d \u201cGo be her sister then.\u201d That was way harsh, Dawn. 40. \u201cWe never fight.\u201d Mallory, I think you\u2019ll find, if you read the 200 books about you, that you ALWAYS fight.\n\nBeacon Pictures\n\n41. \u201cDavid Michael\u2019s only 7.\u201d Okay but Kristy is only 12! Like I get that she didn\u2019t do what she was meant to do but also maybe don\u2019t put the responsibility of caring for children on other children?! 42. Alan Grey was such a pest in the books but he\u2019s kind of sweet (if also very annoying) in this. 43. Hahaha the rap! Oh man, I still know this too. \u201cThe brain, the brain, the centre of the chain\u2026\u201d 44. \u201cLook at these tomatoes, they\u2019re huge!\u201d Why is this so funny to me. 45. I had a top with a heart on it just like Claudia\u2019s! 46. It\u2019s definitely not Kristy\u2019s fault that Claudia failed her quiz. 47. Yes Kristy, drag your deadbeat dad. Draaaag him. 48. Stacey looks so cute with her hair curled like that. 49. Luca is shook she\u2019s 13 and it\u2019s being framed as bad that she lied but uhhhhh I feel like this is all on him. 50. It\u2019s so DRAMATIC the way she\u2019s coming home with her sunglasses on and the sad music playing. I guess if you\u2019re 13 it would feel like the end of the world. 51. \u201cThese aberrations that you call children\u2026\u201d Ellen Burstyn is the best part of this movie. 52. I\u2019m so into Dawn and Ellen Burstyn bonding over tea and trees. 53. Wait now Luca has come crawling back...with his harmonica?! And he knows Stacey's 13? Everything about this is awful. 54. Why is her mother encouraging this?\n\nBeacon Pictures\n\n55. Kristy\u2019s dad actually ghosted her on her birthday. What a guy. 56. This \u201cDaddy\u2019s Girl\u201d song is a liiiittle on the nose right now. 57. Why do they act like getting ice cream cake was a bad idea, ice cream cake is great. 58. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m a Mallory defender now. 59. RIP Cokie Mason\u2019s awesome shoes in that cement. 60. Why am I crying over the girls coming to pick Kristy up?! Their friendship is so important. *sob* 61. Ugh Luca get out of there. 62. \u201cI\u2019m coming back next summer.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be 14.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d Yeah and YOU\u2019LL BE 18 MY GUY this isn\u2019t any better. In fact, it\u2019s worse?! 63. I thought that kiss was sooooooo swoon-worthy as a kid and now it\u2019s super icky. 64. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault Kristy.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re important to us.\u201d Aaaand I\u2019m crying again. 65. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be the grown-up here.\u201d Finally, someone talks some sense. 66. Their profit is $168 from the WHOLE summer?! 67. I ship Alan and Dawn tbh. 68. I don\u2019t care that Kristy\u2019s dad writes her letters every few days, I still hate him. Also what about his other children?! 69. It\u2019s real cute they gave Ellen Burstyn the greenhouse. 70. \u201cIf you can count the number of friends you\u2019ve got on one hand, that\u2019s a lot.\u201d This line means a lot more to me as an adult lol. 71.
