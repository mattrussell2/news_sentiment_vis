RIGHT: San Francisco on Friday, Nov. 16, 2018.\n\nMillions of people in Northern California are suffering through some of the worst air pollution in the world due to all the smoke and ash generated by the raging wildfires. After a week of smoky skies, with no relief in sight yet, experts are warning of health consequences.\n\nIn San Francisco, for example, the air is so bad that schools closed on Fridays, buses have temporarily replaced the open-air cable cars, museums are waiving entrance fees, and health experts are warning people to stay indoors. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District is warning the bad air could last until at least next Tuesday. \u201cYesterday it was just really bad and it kept getting worse,\u201d Rachel Morello-Frosch, an environmental science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told BuzzFeed News on Friday morning. \u201cYou could see haze inside buildings.\u201d California\u2019s most deadly and damaging fire ever erupted north of Sacramento last Thursday and destroyed the town of Paradise. The massive, fast-moving Camp fire has destroyed more than 12,000 structures and resulted in at least 63 deaths. More than 600 other people are still missing. Only about 45% percent of the Camp fire was contained on Friday, according to state officials, and there are several other fires burning across the state, including the damaging Woolsey fire in Southern California. All of this burnt material is getting up in the air, and being swept across the state. So now people living more than 100 miles away are experiencing smoky skies and finding it hard to breathe.\n\nMind-boggling. SF tops world ranking for worst air quality today. #sf #AirQuality #campfire\n\n\u201cThe reason our air looks and feels and tastes unusual to us is because there are particulates from the fires traveling in smoke,\u201d said Brent Andrew, a spokesperson for Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center.\n\nAnd small particulates in the ash and smoke pose a big health risk because they can get lodged inside the lungs and other parts of the body. The resulting short-term impacts for people may include trouble breathing, asthmatic flare-ups, and tightness in the chest. Some people may also experience heart problems. Another health risk posed by the burning of homes and structures, as opposed to just burning vegetation, is the incineration and vaporization of nasty stuff inside buildings, such as metals and leads, Robert Gould, a pathologist on the board of directors for the group Physicians for Social Responsibility, told BuzzFeed News. According to Kaiser Permanente, there\u2019s been a slight increase in the number of patients coming in recently with respiratory problems to their emergency departments in the Bay Area due to smoke in the air from the Camp fire. One way to measure particulate matter levels in the air and its impact on air quality is using what\u2019s called the air quality index. Any values above 100 mean levels of dangerous air pollutants \u2014 known as particulate matter 2.5 \u2014 are above the federal limit, according to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District website. On Friday, levels got up to at least 239 in San Francisco, 267 in San Pablo, 190 in San Jose, and over 200 in Oakland. PurpleAir, another resource for air monitoring, has been showing even higher levels, such as above 300 in parts of San Francisco and above 500 in the Chico area. And real-time monitoring of the globe by Berkeley Earth shows California\u2019s levels of particulate matter stand out, with much of the northern and central sections of the state shaded in orange (unhealthy for sensitive groups), red (unhealthy), or purple (very unhealthy). If you\u2019re in an impacted area, health experts recommend staying indoors, especially in buildings with circulated air, and wearing specific masks when going outside. According to Dan Greenbaum, president of the Boston-based research nonprofit Health Effects Institute, it all boils down to \u201ctrying to avoid exposure where possible.\u201d\n\nFormer EPA official John Kennedy explains the impact wildfires like those in California have on people's health\n\n\u201cWildfire smoke is really unhealthy for people in the sensitive groups \u2014 children, the elderly, people like myself who have respiratory disease, heart disease \u2014 and so we have to take extra precautions to stay out of it,\u201d former EPA official John Kennedy told BuzzFeed\u2019s AM to DM on Friday. \u201cThis air quality is affecting a very large number of people,\u201d Morello-Frosch said. And even though the exposure isn\u2019t long-term, like in India and China, where it\u2019s chronically bad, she explained, the acute effects could happen more frequently as more and more damaging fires occur in a warming world."}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "empa", "title": "Create Your Own Sitcom And We'll Tell You Which Character You Are From \"The Good Place\"", "description": "*laugh track plays* View Entire Post \u203a", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/empa/create-a-sitcom-to-find-out-which-the-good-place-3h5gt", "urlToImage": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-11/17/11/tmp/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/17ad4c4c3bb0185ecf8365c9b2fafe06-3.jpg?crop=623:326;2,0", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:26:53Z", "content": "BuzzFeed Home Sitemap \u00a9 2018 BuzzFeed, Inc.", "fulltext": "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?

E, claro, n\u00f3s tamb\u00e9m gostamos de coisas que s\u00e3o de gra\u00e7a, kkkkkkk. Mas quando chegamos l\u00e1 percebemos que a noite seria mais do que uma mera festa.\n\nQuem fez o convite foi uma amiga, a Maiwsi Ayana, que \u00e9 uma fashionista que tem sua pr\u00f3pria marca, a byMaia. Quem nos recepcionou foi a Regina Ferreira, modelo, produtora de moda e eventos.

Verdade seja dita, para nos impressionar n\u00e3o precisa de muito, MAS... Sentar ao lado do Ferrugem na primeira fileira do desfile, uau! Sentar de frente pro L\u00e9o Santana, uau! Ganhar uma sacola com brindes no maior estilo recebidinhos da semana das blogueiras, U A U! Nos impressionamos f\u00e1cil porque o que nos une, al\u00e9m da ra\u00e7a, \u00e9 a falta de contato que temos com esse mundo VIP, branco e cheio privil\u00e9gios.\n\nO desfile come\u00e7ou e fomos impactado pelo primeiro modelo negro. E mais, outro, quatro, cinco, seis. Quando o desfile j\u00e1 estava no meio que come\u00e7aram a surgir modelos brancos. E isso nos impressionou muito. N\u00f3s nunca t\u00ednhamos ido a um desfile, mas sab\u00edamos que aquilo que estava acontecendo n\u00e3o \u00e9 o padr\u00e3o dentro da ind\u00fastria da moda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"SUKITA, EU ESTOU IMPACTADA.

Parece bobeira, mas mesmo com 30 anos nas costas esse tipo de coisa ainda tem um impacto muito grande. N\u00f3s dois sempre flertamos com a moda e buscamos o nosso estilo, mas nunca sentimos que esse era um espa\u00e7o para n\u00f3s. Nesse desfile ficou mais do que claro que negros podem estar nas passarelas, serem protagonistas e inspirarem o estilo de outras pessoas, como os brancos sempre fizeram.\n\nDessa vez os negros estavam sob o holofote e n\u00e3o era um holofote de viatura policial.\n\nDivulga\u00e7\u00e3o / Dabliu Costa\n\nO que \u00e9 comum se voc\u00ea \u00e9 negro e mora num bairro perif\u00e9rico. Como \u00e9 o caso do modelo Leonan Ernesto, que era balconista de uma lanchonete at\u00e9 ano passado. Ele \u00e9 morador do Complexo do Lins, bairro da Zona Norte do Rio de Janeiro que est\u00e1 frequentemente nos notici\u00e1rios por conta da viol\u00eancia que domina o bairro.\n\n\n\nLeonan, que em qualquer lugar poderia ser tratado como marginal apenas por ser negro e de origem perif\u00e9rica, agora \u00e9 um \u00edcone da moda, e acima de tudo, humano. Com certeza isso \u00e9 transformador, mas precisamos ir um pouco al\u00e9m. Porque n\u00f3s, que tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1vamos na primeira fileira do desfile, tamb\u00e9m poder\u00edamos ser vistos como uma amea\u00e7a assim que pis\u00e1ssemos na rua.\n\n\n\nE foi o que aconteceu comigo (Aline), assim que decidi ir embora sem bateria no celular. De VIP passei a ser suspeita para os taxistas que n\u00e3o pararam pra mim na rua. Tr\u00eas pararam, mas alegaram que a maquininha do cart\u00e3o estava quebrada. Voc\u00ea pode chamar isso de azar, mas pra quem j\u00e1 passou por isso mais de uma vez sabe que isso tem um nome: racismo.\n\n\n\nOu seja, o que determina a forma que vamos ser vistos \u00e9 o local e o contexto em que estamos inseridos. \u00c0s vezes n\u00e3o importa se voc\u00ea \u00e9 modelo ou redator do BuzzFeed, na rua, voc\u00ea \u00e9 visto como uma amea\u00e7a apenas pela sua cor. E isso precisa mudar.\n\n\n\nJ\u00e1 estive na mesma situa\u00e7\u00e3o com meu namorado branco ao lado e pegar um t\u00e1xi n\u00e3o pareceu uma tarefa imposs\u00edvel. Minha vontade era sentar na cal\u00e7ada e chorar, mas decidi que o racismo n\u00e3o iria estragar tudo o que eu tinha vivido naquela noite. Por isso me levantei e caminhei. N\u00e3o era uma passarela, mas tomar essa atitude me tornou mais forte.\n\nDabliu Costa\n\n\n\nEssa forma em que negros podem ser tratados de modos diferentes em lugares diferentes mostra que, mesmo que a gente avance e alcance lugares nunca imaginados, precisamos de mais pessoas mudando a realidade que est\u00e1 ao seu redor. E foi isso que o William Costa, dono e estilista da Dabliu Costa, que cresceu na periferia de S\u00e3o Paulo, e o seu co-criador Phelipe Lemos, um homem negro, fizeram. Eles mudaram dentro da realidade deles como um desfile de moda pode ser feito. Colocaram em evid\u00eancia modelos negros, contrataram produtoras e assessoras negras e deram oportunidade para pessoas que geralmente s\u00e3o esquecidas pela moda. Desta forma, fizeram esse c\u00edrculo de privil\u00e9gio da moda, que \u00e0s vezes parece imposs\u00edvel de quebrar, girar de outra forma.\n\n\n\nPor isso precisamos de mais pessoas com essa mentalidade de mudan\u00e7a nos espa\u00e7os de poder e decis\u00e3o, porque assim estaremos mais pr\u00f3ximos de transformar o mundo em um lugar em que todas as diferen\u00e7as s\u00e3o respeitadas \u2013 e encorajadas. \u00c0s vezes voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa de muito poder para fazer a diferen\u00e7a, pequenas atitudes podem ser feitas para que isso aconte\u00e7a. H\u00e1 muitos negros desejando uma oportunidade em diversas \u00e1reas, e se voc\u00ea \u00e9 uma pessoa que pode dar uma oportunidade, fa\u00e7a isso.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaquela noite, tamb\u00e9m pudemos conversar com o Luccas Carlos e confessamos que odiamos tietar, mas que precis\u00e1vamos dizer para ele a frase \"pretos no topo\", muito utilizada pelos rappers negros. Afinal, foi lindo v\u00ea-lo no palco, brilhando como os modelos naquela noite. N\u00f3s nos apresentamos como os dois \u00fanicos funcion\u00e1rios negros do BuzzFeed e ele nos disse algo que nunca vamos esquecer e esperamos que voc\u00eas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o esque\u00e7am: \"Podemos ser poucos, mas aprendi que, mesmo assim, podemos fazer muito.\"\n\nLogo em seguida, a Kelen, uma amiga que tamb\u00e9m trava a batalha de ser a \u00fanica funcion\u00e1ria negra em seu setor, confessou: \"Quando voc\u00ea (Aline) entrou no BuzzFeed eu comemorei tanto, comemorei como se fosse eu, porque eu sabia que voc\u00ea ia fazer a diferen\u00e7a.\" E \u00e9 por isso que estamos escrevendo agora. O Luccas e a Kelen nos lembraram porque estamos aqui e qual \u00e9 o nosso compromisso. Somos dois, mas podemos escrever um texto como esse para lembrar nossos colegas de trabalho e leitores que falar de sonhos, novos mundos e representatividade pode mudar a vida de pessoas como n\u00f3s."}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Erin Chack", "title": "26 Very Funny Tweets Written By Women This Week", "description": "\"Ever since I hit 30, being roasted by teens has overtaken my fear of sharks.\" View Entire Post \u203a", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/erinchack/women-tweets-11-16-2018", "urlToImage": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-11/16/13/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/26-of-the-funniest-tweets-by-women-this-week-2-24387-1542393461-0_dblbig.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:24:13Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "My husband and I called my sweet, 85-year-old grandma to tell her I got a new job.

From their salad kits to their frozen meals, the aisles are full of creative and delicious gems. So with Thanksgiving right around the corner, I decided to try out some of TJ's best seasonal products. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com\n\nI scanned the aisles for the best Thanksgiving finds, then cooked an entire holiday meal \u2014 from apps and turkey to sides and dessert \u2014 using nothing but pre-made dishes. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nSo, maybe you're not too keen on cooking or you're stuck hosting a last minute Thanksgiving. Perhaps you're just looking for a dish to contribute to a Friendsgiving pot luck. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF 20th Century Fox\n\nWhatever the case, here are some of the best tried-and-true Thanksgiving products at Trader Joe's, and how you can use them to cook a complete, decadent, and seriously tasty holiday meal. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nBut first, a quick note: I bought one of every prepared food mentioned and my grocery bill was $40. This was the perfect amount to sufficiently feed four people (with some leftovers). Depending on the size of your party, I'd suggest buying more.\n\nBuzzFeed\n\nTrader Joe's has no shortage of pre-made party apps that will hold people over until dinnertime. I decided to go with turkey cranberry meatballs ($4.49) and camembert and cranberry sauce filo dough bites ($3.99), both of which can be found in the frozen aisle and feel super fall-y and festive. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed What's super convenient is that you can heat up both of these apps at the same time in the oven. Just plan to pop them into the oven about 20 minutes before guests arrive, and they'll be piping hot and ready to serve once everyone is here.\n\nBoth of these apps were virtually impossible to mess up, and you could easily trick anyone into thinking they're homemade. The camembert bites were gooey and melty, and the meatballs had a slight sweet flavor from the cranberries that felt very festive and unique. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed In order to keep the meatballs moist, I'd cook them for a few minutes shorter than the package directions indicate (they're already cooked so you don't have to worry about undercooking). And you could serve them with a side of cranberry sauce for dipping.\n\nBuzzFeed\n\nEveryone knows the side dishes are the best part of Thanksgiving dinner, right? Right. Luckily, Trader Joe's has a pretty insane lineup of pre-made sides.\n\nCornbread Stuffing Mix ($3.99) Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed This one takes a little bit of assembling, but only about 10 minutes of \"cooking.\" You just mix the seasoning packet with butter and water, bring it to a simmer, add the bread mixture, and let it sit until the cornbread soaks up the liquid.\n\nFor so little effort, this stuffing was delicious. And I liked that the box offers instructions for people who prefer their stuffing on the dryer or moister side. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nCauliflower Gratin ($3.99) Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed 10/10 would make this again. It basically tastes like mac and cheese, except it's cauliflower. The cauliflower gets soft and chewy, but the breadcrumbs give it a crunchy texture, and it's so cheesy. This would be a hit on any holiday table.\n\nHatch Chile Mac 'n' Cheese Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed TJ's frozen mac 'n' cheese is a staple in my kitchen. During the fall, I'm obsessed with their butternut squash version. And when that goes out of season, the hatch chile mac 'n' cheese gets me through winter. It happens to be the perfect addition to any Thanksgiving spread. The chile gives it a little bit of a kick, which cuts the seriously cheesy, rich pasta.\n\nMashed Sweet Potatoes with Maple Roasted Pecans ($4.99) Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Every table should have a sweet potato casserole, but TBH it's kind of a pain to make from scratch. Enter: This store-bought version. You just pop it in the oven for about 20 minutes, then top it with the crushed pecans. You could add some marshmallows and a drizzle of maple syrup too, if that's your thing. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato casserole because it's a bit too sweet for me, so this was my least favorite side dish of the bunch.\n\nMashed Cauliflower ($2.99) Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed One of my favorite things about Trader Joe's is that they make it easy to eat healthy, thanks to lightened-up swaps like spiralized carrot pasta, riced broccoli, and so much more. This mashed cauliflower is no exception. You just heat it up on the stove and it turns into a convincing mashed potato substitute in minutes.\n\nThe mashed cauliflower is a bit denser than your typical light and airy mashed potatoes, but it still tastes decadent and very creamy. You can also add a bit of shredded cheese to make it thicker. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed If you're crazy about light and fluffy mashed potatoes, though, you may be a bit disappointed and should stick to the real thing.\n\nI'd make any single one of these sides again. All tasted delicious, took almost no time to prepare, and tasted like they could've been homemade. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nBuzzFeed\n\nI'll be honest, I'm terrified of roasting turkey in my apartment. The last time I tried roasting a whole bird I set my smoke alarm off. Luckily, TJ's sells a bone-in, pre-brined half turkey breast ($6.99/lb). Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nIt comes in a bag, covered in herb butter. All you have to do is heat it up while basting occasionally, let it sit, and then slice it. It's ready to eat in about 30 minutes flat. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed The packaging also provides instructions for making a quick pan gravy using the drippings, olive oil, and flour. You can whip it up in just a few minutes.\n\nNow I'll admit, I was pretty skeptical. But the turkey got crispy on the outside while staying super moist on the inside. The herb butter was also delicious. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Let's be honest, it's definitely not as pretty as a full thanksgiving Turkey, and if your guests like dark meat, they may be disappointed. But overall, this turkey took minimal effort and was really satisfying.\n\nWith the turkey fresh from the oven, Thanksgiving dinner is served. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nAnd you'd never know absolutely nothing was cooked from scratch. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nBuzzFeed\n\nOf course, I didn't forget about dessert, which is arguably the most important part of Thanksgiving. I always have a tough time choosing between apple and pumpkin, so I decided to get both. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed I got a rustic apple tart ($4.99) and a pumpkin cheesecake ($6.99), which were both in the frozen aisle.\n\nHeat the apple tart in the oven for 20 minutes until it's warm throughout. The cheesecake just has to thaw. You can leave it in the fridge for four hours (or overnight), or to quickly thaw it, remove it from the box and leave it at room temperature for an hour. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed No matter how full you are, I guarantee you won't be able to resist having seconds of these babies.\n\nTBH, the dessert was probably the highlight of the meal. Both tasted incredible, and there's no \"baking\" required. So thanks to Trader Joe's, you really can have your pie and eat it too.

H\u00e1 uma ordem na sele\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00e9dicos para as vagas: a prefer\u00eancia \u00e9 de m\u00e9dicos formados no Brasil. 5. Depois, vem os brasileiros formados no exterior. Sobrando vagas, elas s\u00e3o oferecidas a m\u00e9dicos estrangeiros formados no exterior. 6. E se as vagas ainda assim n\u00e3o forem preenchidas, s\u00e3o oferecidas para m\u00e9dicos cubanos seguindo um acordo internacional com a Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Pan-Americana da Sa\u00fade (OPAS).\n\n7. O Mais M\u00e9dicos hoje tem 18.240 vagas: 8.332 s\u00e3o ocupadas por cubanos; 4.525 por brasileiros formados no Brasil; 2.824 por brasileiros formados no exterior e 451 por m\u00e9dicos de nacionalidades diversas. 8. Al\u00e9m de bolsas-forma\u00e7\u00e3o no valor de cerca de R$ 11 mil, os participantes recebem aux\u00edlio-moradia e aux\u00edlio-alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o do Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade. 9. A participa\u00e7\u00e3o no programa \u00e9 de 40 horas semanais, 32 delas atuando em unidades b\u00e1sicas de sa\u00fade e 8 horas dedicadas a a\u00e7\u00f5es educativas. 10. Nesta quarta-feira (14) o governo cubano decidiu retirar os m\u00e9dicos do pa\u00eds ap\u00f3s o presidente eleito Jair Bolsonaro dar a declara\u00e7\u00e3o de que \"n\u00e3o h\u00e1 comprova\u00e7\u00e3o\" de que cubanos seriam mesmo m\u00e9dicos. 11.

A Medida Provis\u00f3ria n\u00ba 621, de 8 de julho de 2013, assegura a participa\u00e7\u00e3o de profissionais formados no exterior no programa Mais M\u00e9dicos sem a necessidade do Revalida.\n\nAraqu\u00e9m Alc\u00e2ntara / Reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o / Via nacoesunidas.org\n\n13. Uma decis\u00e3o do Supremo Tribunal Federal de novembro de 2017 manteve as regras do programa ao julgar duas a\u00e7\u00f5es de setores da classe m\u00e9dica sobre a necessidade do Revalida. 14. A Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Mundial de Sa\u00fade n\u00e3o tem recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica sobre este tipo de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o, deixando a decis\u00e3o de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o ou n\u00e3o a cada pa\u00eds. 15. O Mais M\u00e9dicos tem aprova\u00e7\u00e3o de 94% das pessoas atendidas, segundo pesquisa da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG). 16. O programa n\u00e3o vai acabar. O plano do governo brasileiro \u00e9 preencher as vagas com brasileiros. 17. Os m\u00e9dicos cubanos come\u00e7am a deixar seus postos nas pr\u00f3ximas semanas e todos dever\u00e3o ter sa\u00eddo do pa\u00eds at\u00e9 o dia 25 de dezembro. 18.

A estimativa tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 que sejam afetados 24 milh\u00f5es de brasileiros, j\u00e1 que cada m\u00e9dico chefia uma equipe de M\u00e9dico de Fam\u00edlia, respons\u00e1vel pelo atendimento de 3,4 mil pessoas. 20. Numericamente, S\u00e3o Paulo e Bahia s\u00e3o os estados que mais perder\u00e3o m\u00e9dicos com a sa\u00edda dos profissionais cubanos do programa, mas outras \u00e1reas ser\u00e3o mais afetadas. 21. Nas regi\u00f5es ind\u00edgenas, por exemplo, 301 m\u00e9dicos cubanos s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis por 90% do atendimento. 22. Dos cerca de R$ 11 mil de bolsa-forma\u00e7\u00e3o, os m\u00e9dicos cubanos recebiam R$ 3 mil e o restante era repassado pela Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Pan-Americana da Sa\u00fade para o governo cubano. 23. Um grupo de pelo menos 150 m\u00e9dicos participantes do programa Mais M\u00e9dicos entrou na justi\u00e7a para receber o aux\u00edlio de forma integral. 24. O envio de m\u00e9dicos para outros pa\u00edses \u00e9 a maior fonte de renda para Cuba, gerando uma m\u00e9dia anual de cerca de US$ 11,5 bilh\u00f5es.\n\n25. Al\u00e9m de Venezuela e Brasil, os mercados mais importantes, os m\u00e9dicos cubanos est\u00e3o em pa\u00edses como Catar, Kuwait, China, Arg\u00e9lia, Ar\u00e1bia Saudita e \u00c1frica do Sul. 26. Cuba tamb\u00e9m oferece servi\u00e7os gratuitos com o Programa Integral de Sa\u00fade, sistema destinado a 27 pa\u00edses com menos recursos, como Haiti, Bol\u00edvia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicar\u00e1gua, Honduras, Eti\u00f3pia, Congo, Tanz\u00e2nia, Zimb\u00e1bue, entre outros. 27. M\u00e9dicos cubanos est\u00e3o presentes em 62 pa\u00edses, segundo dados de 2016. 28. Em um relat\u00f3rio da ONU, Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas, de 2016 considerou que um programa como o Mais M\u00e9dicos seria ben\u00e9fico para qualquer pa\u00eds que decidisse adot\u00e1-lo. 29.

I mean, how would you sop up all of the flavorful turkey juices without a dinner roll?\n\nIn my humble opinion, the best part of Thanksgiving dinner is the rolls. I mean, how would you sop up all of the flavorful turkey juices without a dinner roll?\n\nSo we went ahead and rounded up nine of our most helpful tips for making dinner rolls \u2014 and we included our ultimate recipe at the bottom of the post so you can make 'em at home.\n\nFor our recipe, we stuck to using good old all-purpose flour. Because this style of flour is so refined, it yields consistent and predictable results \u2014 which is precisely what we wanted.\n\nFor predictable and consistent results, use all-purpose flour to make your dough.\n\nWhen testing our dinner roll recipe, we tested three different types of yeast: Instant, fresh, and active dry. Instant yeast produced a dough that was too hard, the fresh was way too soft, but active dry was just right. The yeast was easy to control and gave us the perfect amount of rise .\n\nUse active dry yeast for the most controlled rise.\n\nTo activate the yeast, we combined it with warm milk, melted butter, and sugar. The butter and sugar give the yeast food to feed on, and you should begin seeing the dough foam up. Something to watch out for is the temperature of the milk, it should be about the same as your body's. Anything hotter might actually kill your yeast. If it doesn't look foamy after about 10 minutes, throw it out and start over . Your yeast might be past its prime and dead.\n\nAnd make sure it's at the right temperature.\n\nWhen it comes time to knead your dough, make sure to keep a bit of flour on your surface to prevent it from sticking. If you're kneading it by hand, the entire process can take up to ten minutes. People often worry about over-kneading their dough, but if you're doing it by hand this is pretty unlikely \u2014 however, if you use a stand mixer to do the kneading, you can over-knead it. Once your dough forms a smooth ball that holds its shape, stop the mixer. If your dough starts to break apart and look clumpy, you've probably over kneaded it. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nKneading the dough by hand takes time \u2014 up to 10 minutes actually \u2014 so don't worry about over-kneading it.\n\nOne way to tell if your dough is kneaded enough is to grab a small piece of dough, stretch it between your fingers, and check if it tears. If the dough stretches without tearing, you should be able to see the small strands of gluten and light shining through . This means your dough is good to go. \u2713\n\nTo see if your dough has been kneaded enough, do the window pane test.\n\nAt this point your work surface is probably covered in dry dough and flour. An easy way to clean it off is by using a bench scraper. This handy tools can be purchased online or at most cooking supply stores and will seriously help you out when making bread. If you don't have one, a wet cloth will work just fine.\n\nUse a bench scraper to remove any dried bits of dough and flour from your work surface.\n\nAnother way to do it is to cut the dough ball in half, then each half in half, and so forth until you have 16 pieces. This method won't be as accurate, but it will give you rolls that are roughly the same size.\n\nFor consistent dough balls, a digital kitchen scale is your friend. You just weigh the entire ball of dough, then divide it into the number of rolls you want to make (in this case, 16) \u2014 this is how much you want each dough ball to weigh.\n\nUse a digital kitchen scale to make sure every roll is the same size \u2014 or just use the halving method and eyeball it.\n\n7. Use a digital kitchen scale to make sure every roll is the same size \u2014 or just use the halving method and eyeball it.\n\nFor our roll recipe, 30 minutes is the perfect amount of proofing time before they hit the oven.\n\nOnce you divide your dough and roll the pieces into balls, it's time for the final proof. This rise can takes time, so don't rush it. If you're impatient and don't give them enough time to rise, you may end up with under-proofed rolls that are dense \u2014 and if you over -proof them (if you accidentally left them for over an hour) the rolls could rise too high and collapse in the oven.\n\nNo matter how eager you are, don't rush the final proof.\n\nAfter egg washing, we sprinkled our rolls with a bit of flaky sea salt, which is totally optional. Sesame seeds, whole spices, and freshly ground black pepper would all be great options for sprinkling on top.\n\nRight before hitting the oven, we egg-washed our rolls to give them a nice brown color and glossy shine. When brushing them, go slowly and make sure you don't poke them too hard . The rolls are super delicate at this point, so brushing them too aggressively can cause them to deflate.\n\nUse an egg wash to give your rolls a nice glossy finish.\n\nSo, are you ready to bake some rolls? Let's do it!\n\nAnd that's it! Your rolls are ready to hit the oven. These babies bake up golden, pillowy, and delicious. While they may be humble, dinner rolls are one of the most underrated Thanksgiving side dishes.\n\nTHE ULTIMATE DINNER ROLLS\n\nServings: 16\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n1 cup whole milk (110-115\u02daF (45\u02daC))\n\n\u00bd cup warm water (110-115\u02daF (45\u02daC))\n\n\u00bc cup (\u00bd stick) unsalted butter, melted\n\n\u00bc cup sugar\n\n2\u00bc teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast\n\n4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting\n\n1\u00bd teaspoons kosher salt\n\n2 large eggs, room temperature\n\nNeutral oil, for greasing\n\nSea salt, for sprinkling\n\nPREPERATION\n\n1. In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, combine the warm milk, warm water, melted butter, and sugar.\n\n2. Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the wet ingredients, stir to combine, and let stand for 5 minutes, until foamy\n\n3. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt, and stir to combine. Beat 1 egg, then add to the bloomed yeast mixture. Pour the wet ingredients into the flour and use a knife to stir until the mixture just comes together and forms a dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth. Add more flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking. To test if it\u2019s done, tear off a small piece of dough and stretch into a thin layer. If the dough doesn\u2019t rip, it\u2019s ready. Or, press a finger into the dough to see if it bounces back.\n\n4. Lightly grease a large glass bowl with oil. Add the dough, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.\n\n5. Punch down the dough, then turn out onto a floured surface. Knead for a few more minutes, just until the dough is smooth, about 2 minutes.\n\n6. Divide the dough into 16 equal balls, roughly the size of tangerines.\n\n7. Knead the balls, gathering the edges of the dough toward the center to make a taut, round ball with a smooth top.\n\n8. Place the rolls on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes.\n\n9. Preheat the oven to 375\u02daF (190\u02daC).\n\n10. Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl. Uncover the rolls and brush with the egg wash. Lightly sprinkle the rolls with sea salt.\n\n11. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the rolls have lightly browned and doubled in size.\n\n12.

Eu fui convencida de que era pela minha sa\u00fade, mas hoje eu tenho consci\u00eancia de que a press\u00e3o que sofri de pessoas do meu c\u00edrculo social e de m\u00e9dicos diziam respeito ao meu tamanho, n\u00e3o ao meu colesterol alto. As coisas que eu esperava que acontecessem de fato aconteceram: parei de sofrer gordofobia - o tratamento que eu recebia antes da cirurgia era MUITO diferente do depois de emagrecer, mas isso n\u00e3o me tornou uma pessoa mais feliz. Eu perdi 50% dos fios de cabelo e tive s\u00edndrome de dumping. Por\u00e9m a possibilidade que nunca foi nem mencionada foi exatamente a pior consequ\u00eancia para mim: perdi tr\u00eas dentes por causa da baixa absor\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e1lcio, que foi o \u00fanico suplemento que n\u00e3o me receitaram. Como tive perda \u00f3ssea, o dentista est\u00e1 encontrando dificuldades para realizar implantes, n\u00e3o \u00e9 somente uma quest\u00e3o est\u00e9tica.

Voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 emagrecer rapidamente, mas manter seu corpo e rotina s\u00f3 depende de voc\u00ea.\" - Juliana, 30 anos\n\n6. \"Achei que a cirurgia mudaria meus h\u00e1bitos por completo e que n\u00e3o engordaria mais, que seria f\u00e1cil manter uma rotina saud\u00e1vel.\" \"Sempre fui obesa, comecei a engordar com 5 anos e tenho hist\u00f3rico de obesidade na fam\u00edlia. Minha inf\u00e2ncia e adolesc\u00eancia inteira foi indo em m\u00e9dicos e nutricionistas tentando emagrecer e nunca consegui. Fazer a bari\u00e1trica foi uma decis\u00e3o minha, depois de muitas frustra\u00e7\u00f5es. Achei que iria emagrecer r\u00e1pido e que ficaria super magra. De fato minha qualidade de vida melhorou muito, tenho mais disposi\u00e7\u00e3o e n\u00e3o tenho nenhum problema de sa\u00fade. Por\u00e9m meu emagrecimento foi lento. Emagreci 48 kg com muito esfor\u00e7o, seguindo a dieta \u00e0 risca e praticando muita atividade f\u00edsica, mas n\u00e3o atingi minha meta que era chegar nos 62 kg (meu m\u00ednimo foi 66). Achei que a cirurgia mudaria meus h\u00e1bitos por completo e que n\u00e3o engordaria mais, que seria f\u00e1cil manter uma rotina saud\u00e1vel, mas a verdade \u00e9 que a cabe\u00e7a de uma pessoa obesa \u00e9 trai\u00e7oeira, n\u00f3s sempre tentamos nos sabotar. A obesidade \u00e9 uma doen\u00e7a que n\u00e3o tem cura, precisamos nos vigiar o tempo inteiro. A bari\u00e1trica foi a melhor escolha que eu fiz na minha vida. Nunca me arrependi. Ela me ajudou a sair de um casulo, me tornei muito mais comunicativa e descobri que gostava de v\u00e1rias coisas que antes eu deixava de fazer por vergonha e medo do julgamento de outras pessoas. Hoje sou muito mais segura e alegre e n\u00e3o me limito por mais nada por conta do meu corpo, que por sinal est\u00e1 longe de ser perfeito.\" - An\u00f4nima, 25 anos\n\nNadezda_grapes / Getty Images\n\n7. \"A cirurgia s\u00f3 funciona para quem muda de vida mesmo.\" \"Eu esperava que eu ia emagrecer e nunca mais me preocupar, nem com as doen\u00e7as, nem com o ganho de peso. N\u00e3o \u00e9 bem assim. Eu aprendi que sou obesa - e sempre serei se eu descuidar da minha alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o. Depois que eu parei de emagrecer, engordei um pouco. Isso me mostrou que engordar \u00e9 mais do que poss\u00edvel depois da bari\u00e1trica, o que me fez mudar DE VERDADE minha mente. Entendi que eu precisava mudar minha alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e a forma de comer (mudar muito, no meu caso). S\u00f3 que a gente tem que admitir que com a cirurgia mudar a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o fica bem mais f\u00e1cil. Isso porque a gente tem o est\u00f4mago menor e realmente n\u00e3o cabe tanta comida. Voc\u00ea passa mal, vomita e se sente muito desconfort\u00e1vel. Isso ajuda (n\u00e3o parece, mas ajuda) porque voc\u00ea n\u00e3o quer se sentir mal, ent\u00e3o, depois de algumas vezes, voc\u00ea come\u00e7a a parar. Eu j\u00e1 tive que interromper jantares com amigos porque passei mal. Parece que vou morrer tamanho \u00e9 o mal-estar. Eu simplesmente n\u00e3o quero me sentir assim nunca mais. Com isso, quem faz bari\u00e1trica passa a ter limites. Antes, eu n\u00e3o tinha limite algum porque cabia tudo. Agora, eu sei quando estou chegando num ponto cr\u00edtico. Com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s doen\u00e7as, de fato tudo melhorou. Meus exames s\u00e3o impec\u00e1veis. Tomo vitaminas todos os dias e venho me mantendo extremamente saud\u00e1vel. N\u00e3o sou mag\u00e9rrima, sou saud\u00e1vel. E assim quero ficar. Eu ainda tenho medo das consequ\u00eancias da cirurgia quando eu envelhecer, mas, at\u00e9 o momento, me sinto \u00f3tima e muito mais saud\u00e1vel. Aprendi a comer direito, valorizo a comida de verdade. Tive problemas com meus cabelos (eles caem demais por conta da cirurgia e n\u00e3o voltaram totalmente ao normal) e com meus dentes (quebraram muito...consegui consert\u00e1-los, mas tenho medo de quebrar novamente ent\u00e3o prefiro ficar longe de alimentos muito duros). Mas no geral, tenho mais disposi\u00e7\u00e3o, pratico exerc\u00edcios f\u00edsicos regularmente, gosto de sair (odiava ir pra praia e agora quero ir sempre), gosto de comprar roupas novamente, n\u00e3o ligo para as imperfei\u00e7\u00f5es do meu corpo (elas ainda existem, obviamente) e minha sa\u00fade est\u00e1 fant\u00e1stica. Faria tudo novamente se fosse preciso (espero nunca mais precisar, claro).\" - An\u00f4nima, 39 anos\n\n8. \"Hoje, quase quatro anos depois, eu recuperei dez quilos, mas eu n\u00e3o fa\u00e7o disso um tormento.\" \"Conheci algumas pessoas que correram atr\u00e1s de atestado s\u00f3 porque queriam fazer bari\u00e1trica por est\u00e9tica. Uma coisa \u00e9 deixar de comer chocolate no final de semana porque est\u00e1 de dieta. Outra COMPLETAMENTE DIFERENTE \u00e9 aprender a viver s\u00f3 com copinho de caf\u00e9. Voc\u00ea tem que estar muito preparado pra n\u00e3o pirar, porque seu c\u00e9rebro \u00e9 programado pra bater um PF. A primeira fase do p\u00f3s-operat\u00f3rio \u00e9 uma verdadeira vit\u00f3ria a cada dia que passa. E voc\u00ea vai enjoar de isot\u00f4nico e \u00e1gua de c\u00f4co. No mais, todo cuidado do mundo pra n\u00e3o desenvolver uma anorexia ou ortorexia. \u00c9 normal ganhar de volta alguns quilos depois porque voc\u00ea perde muito de uma vez por causa do susto no corpo. Depois que ele se acostuma, seu organismo pode relaxar um pouco, mas nada que alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o balanceada e atividade f\u00edsica n\u00e3o resolvam. Hoje, quase quatro anos depois da minha dieta, eu recuperei dez quilos. Mas eu n\u00e3o fa\u00e7o disso um tormento porque ainda acho que estou muito melhor do que antes, e muito mais saud\u00e1vel.\" - Paula Foit, 28 anos\n\n9. \"Eu recuperei a vontade de conquistar coisas, de conhecer gente e lugares novos, de viver de maneira geral.\" \"Eu tinha v\u00e1rias doen\u00e7as ligadas \u00e0 obesidade: gordura no f\u00edgado, apneia do sono, refluxo gastroesof\u00e1gico, predisposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 diabetes, ansiedade, depress\u00e3o e manchas escuras no corpo. O fato de n\u00e3o dormir bem me impedia de ter energia para malhar e pela ansiedade de estar engordando, eu comia desesperadamente, o que me levava ao refluxo. Ou seja, era um ciclo que depredava minha sa\u00fade. A \u00fanica sa\u00edda foi a bari\u00e1trica. Eu pensava que jamais conseguiria comer decentemente de novo, que ia vomitar todas as vezes que comesse algo gorduroso, ou que n\u00e3o teria mais toler\u00e2ncia ao \u00e1lcool e que eu ia viver de sopa. O que aconteceu foi o oposto. Eu evito comer coisas gordurosas pro meu pr\u00f3prio bem e foco em alimentos org\u00e2nicos. Mas eu tenho boa toler\u00e2ncia ao \u00e1lcool, consigo comer comida gordurosa se eu quiser e nada de ruim me acontece. Ou seja, o equil\u00edbrio \u00e9 a palavra chave para um bari\u00e1trico. Como resultado, TODOS os aspectos da minha vida mudaram: autoconfian\u00e7a, apar\u00eancia, sa\u00fade (todas as doen\u00e7as citadas est\u00e3o curadas - e a ansiedade eu controlo com terapia) e vontade de viver. Eu recuperei a vontade de conquistar coisas, de conhecer gente e lugares novos, de viver de maneira geral.\" - Leonardo Lopes Olivares, 29 anos\n\nAnna_isaeva / Getty Images\n\n10. \"Depois de muita terapia, percebi que n\u00e3o tenho que perseguir um padr\u00e3o, mas me alimentar e me exercitar para que o meu corpo alcance o ideal pra mim.\" \"Todo mundo conhece o amigo do amigo que morreu ou que vive doente, mas casos assim s\u00e3o rar\u00edssimos. D\u00e1 medo de operar, ent\u00e3o pesquise o m\u00e1ximo que puder, participe de grupos de bari\u00e1tricos e n\u00e3o pule as fases do pr\u00e9-operat\u00f3rio. Acompanhamento psicol\u00f3gico antes e depois s\u00e3o superimportantes e n\u00e3o se deixe influenciar pelos outros. A bari\u00e1trica mudou completamente minha rotina. A alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o passou a ser um t\u00f3pico importante pra mim, assim como atividade f\u00edsica. Hoje eu vejo a vida que a obesidade me roubava, as coisas que eu n\u00e3o conseguia fazer e as experi\u00eancias de que eu me privava por ser obeso. Eu levo uma vida normal, como pouco, mas levo uma dieta balanceada e consigo comer de tudo. Depois de muita terapia, percebi que n\u00e3o tenho que perseguir um padr\u00e3o, mas me alimentar e me exercitar para que o meu corpo alcance o ideal pra mim. Hoje eu n\u00e3o sou sarado, sou magro mesmo, mas tudo bem. Sou saud\u00e1vel e me sinto bem e \u00e9 isso o que importa.\" - Gustavo Dias - 30 anos\n\n11. \"Eu tinha a cirurgia bari\u00e1trica como um escolha de 'pregui\u00e7oso'. At\u00e9 que por recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o de um m\u00e9dico eu passei a pesquisar sobre o procedimento.\" \"Com 23 anos eu tive dois in\u00edcios de AVC. Sempre tive receio da cirurgia e achava que n\u00e3o era pra mim. Eu tinha a cirurgia bari\u00e1trica como um escolha de 'pregui\u00e7oso'. At\u00e9 que por recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o de um m\u00e9dico eu passei a pesquisar sobre o procedimento, marquei uma consulta com um cirurgi\u00e3o na minha cidade e, um ano depois (demorei um tempo para me decidir), fiz a cirurgia. Eu esperava emagrecer sim, mas n\u00e3o t\u00e3o r\u00e1pido como foi. A previs\u00e3o era de eliminar 60 kg em dois anos. Com um ano de cirurgia eu j\u00e1 tinha perdido tudo isso, sendo que operei com 140 kg. Sem d\u00favida alguma, a bari\u00e1trica transformou a minha vida. Depois da cirurgia a minha vontade de viver aumentou e hoje em dia quero aproveitar as oportunidades que esse mundo nos oferece. Ap\u00f3s o procedimento eu passei a ter mais \u00e2nimo, disposi\u00e7\u00e3o e for\u00e7a de vontade para correr atr\u00e1s dos meus objetivos.\" - Jo\u00e3o Guilherme Xavier, 26 anos\n\n12. \"\u00c0s vezes a gente acha que o problema \u00e9 o nosso corpo, sendo que, na verdade, ele est\u00e1 na nossa cabe\u00e7a - e ela n\u00e3o pode ser operada.\" \"Eu esperava que seria dif\u00edcil, mas n\u00e3o tanto quanto realmente foi.

Mesmo que seja algo que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o goste, d\u00e1 vontade de comer. Ap\u00f3s um m\u00eas de dieta l\u00edquida, meu primeiro banquete foi uma colher de pur\u00ea de batata e uma colher de frango triturado. Dos deuses!

Por isso \u00e9 importante estar cercado de bons profissionais e lembrar que \u00e9 s\u00f3 uma fase e que n\u00e3o vale a pena botar tudo a perder por causa de uma vontade moment\u00e2nea.\" - Camila Castro, 26 anos"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Maitland Quitmeyer", "title": "28 Beauty Products With Small Price Tags And Major Results", "description": "Makeup and skincare that's well-worth the cost \u2014 and THEN some.

Polvilhe o restante dos queijos cheddar e mu\u00e7arela sobre a quesadilla. Retire o pote do centro do anel.

That represents 15% of current Conservative MPs, the threshold for triggering a no-confidence vote in the party\u2019s leader, prime minister Theresa May.\n\nThis is the mechanism for triggering a no-confidence vote: The dissenting MPs individually write letters to Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, the body that represents Tory backbenchers, expressing no confidence in the prime minister. On Thursday, the leader of the hardline Tory Brexiteer European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, theatrically announced that he had submitted his letter to Brady at a packed press conference on the steps outside Parliament.\n\nBrady keeps a tally, and if the threshold is reached he\u2019ll call a vote of all Tory MPs \u2014 unless Theresa May decides to resign first.\n\nIn the year and a half since the last general election, there\u2019s been a lot of speculation about how many letters Brady has received. There was a flurry of anxiousness among some Tories at the start of the year that the count had gone into the 40s. But Brady is famously tight-lipped about both the number of letters he\u2019s received and the identities of those who\u2019ve submitted them. Speaking at this year\u2019s Tory party conference in Birmingham he mocked the pundits\u2019 attempts to keep score, saying MPs often told journalists \u201cthey had sent in letters which they hadn\u2019t, or that they\u2019ve withdrawn letters they never sent in the first place\u201d.\n\nWhat happens once 48 letters have been received?\n\nIf Brady\u2019s count does reach 48, he has to agree with May a timetable for a confidence vote \u201cas soon as possible in the circumstances prevailing\u201d. The ballot would be held secretly.\n\nThe last time the Tories held such a ballot was in 2003, when Iain Duncan Smith was leader. In that case, the vote was held the day after the chair of the 1922 committee announced he\u2019d received enough letters to trigger a ballot. Duncan lost and was removed as leader.\n\nMay would only have to win the confidence vote by a simple majority to remain as leader. At present, that amounts to 158 MPs.\n\nSome Tories think that a narrow win isn\u2019t enough \u2014 that a leader without a strong majority wouldn\u2019t have the authority to continue. However, some Downing Street advisers have argued that because of the extraordinary circumstances, May could carry on even if she scraped through by only a few votes.\n\nWhat happens after the result?\n\nUnder party rules, if May wins a confidence vote she can\u2019t be challenged for another year. That explains why she hasn\u2019t faced a confidence vote before now, even though so many of her MPs have been desperately unhappy with her Brexit policy: They calculated that they didn\u2019t have the numbers to win and would then be stuck with her.\n\nIf May loses a confidence vote, she\u2019s finished \u2014 a leadership contest would be held and the party would elect a new prime minister.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Yui Kashima", "title": "Google\u306e\u672c\u6c17\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u300cPixel 3\u300d\u306e\u30a8\u30b0\u3044\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u898b\u3066\u2026\u300cAI\u3063\u3066\u3059\u3054\u3044\u3093\u3060\u306a\u2026\u300d\u300c\u4e00\u56de\u4f7f\u3046\u3068\u623b\u308c\u306a\u3044\u300d", "description": "Google\u304c\u9577\u3044\u6642\u9593\u3092\u304b\u3051\u3066\u84c4\u7a4d\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3068AI\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u30ac\u30c3\u30b7\u30ac\u30b7\u306b\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3088\u3002\u4e00\u756a\u5b9f\u611f\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u3059\u3002 Google\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u958b\u767a\u8005\u3067\u3042\u308bHajime Morita\u3055\u3093\u3082\u300c\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306b\u306f\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u4e00\u756a\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304f\u3089\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u9177\u4f7f\u3057\u3066\u308b\u3002\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u843d\u3061\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001\u958b\u767a\u3067\u306f\u305d\u3053\u306b\u82e6\u52b4\u3057\u305f\u300d\u3068Rebuild\u3067\u8a9e\u308b\u307b\u3069\u3002", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/yuikashima/googleaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "urlToImage": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-11/16/3/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/google-2-30468-1542356286-5_dblbig.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T08:31:54Z", "content": "BuzzFeed Sitemap \u00a9 2018 BuzzFeed, Inc.", "fulltext": "Yui Kashima / BuzzFeed\n\n\u5b9f\u306f\u3053\u308c\u306f11\u670815\u65e5\u306b\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fdNight Sight\uff08\u591c\u666f\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\uff09\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\nPixel 3\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u4e3b\u306b\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3001\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u3068\u3044\u3046\u6280\u8853\u3002\n\n\u5149\u5b66\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u88ab\u5199\u4f53\u306e\u50cf\u3092\u6349\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308a\u3001\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u51e6\u7406\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3092\u524d\u63d0\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u8a00\u3046\u3068\u3001Pixel 3\u3067\u64ae\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3001Google\u306e\u53e1\u667a\u3092\u96c6\u7a4d\u3057\u3066\u3067\u304d\u308b\u8d85\u3059\u3054\u3044\u5408\u6210\u5199\u771f\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Cassie Smyth", "title": "Do You Remember Your Nursery Rhymes?", "description": "Are you and Humpty Dumpty still close?

Character-based visa cancellations usually follow a criminal conviction.\n\nBut there is an increasing trend where visas are cancelled before a trial takes place. That is possible under a different provision \u2013 section 116 \u2013 that allows the government to cancel a person\u2019s visa when they are charged with a crime, before they are ever tried, convicted or sentenced.\n\nThe Migration Act lets the states and territories issue \"criminal justice stay certificates\", which is supposed to hit pause on any plans to deport someone who hasn\u2019t finished their criminal justice process. But the DPPs said they had been told home affairs had decided that the certificate could be trumped by a separate section, section 198, compelling the government to deport \u201can unlawful non-citizen\u201d who asks to be removed. That section says the deportation has to happen as soon as possible.\n\nThe department\u2019s decision could have \u201cfar-reaching\u201d consequences, the DPPs wrote. They cautioned that it meant \u201ca non-citizen could circumvent the administration of justice \u2013 at any stage of that process \u2013 simply by requesting their removal\u201d from Australia.\n\nThe DPPs suggested the decision could invite criminal tourism \u2014 people travelling to Australia \u201cfor the specific purpose of carrying out criminal offences, knowing that they would be effectively rendered immune from prosecution and the consequences of conviction by making a request for removal\u201d.\n\nIt is not clear whether any criminal defendants have yet been deported before being convicted or sentenced. BuzzFeed News has approached each DPP for comment. At the time of publication, the DPPs in Queensland, South Australia and Victoria had declined to comment.\n\nShadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus criticised the government\u2019s decision in an interview on ABC radio today, saying that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to have trials taking place when people have committed offences here in Australia\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think that the administration of our criminal justice system, making sure that people who\u2019ve committed serious crimes in our country are ... charged and convicted and punished for their crimes, has got to take precedence over any idea [home affairs minister] Mr Dutton and his department may have.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, the DPPs foreshadowed a potential legal challenge, writing that they \u201ctrust your department will change its view, to obviate the necessity of any challenge to that view.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Department of Home Affairs confirmed that Pezzullo had received the letter, but did not respond to questions about his response, or whether anyone had been deported ahead of a trial."}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "emmaReneeS", "title": "Tell Us Your \"Riverdale\" Preferences And We'll Give You A Southside Serpent To Hook Up With", "description": "They're all snacks, tbh.

The vote is organised by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), and the change to the kilogram means that the world will no longer need to rely on a small cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy known as the Prototype Kilogram. The current method of created standardised kilograms is laborious and impractical. The Prototype Kilogram (or Le Grand K) has been housed in the basement of the BIPM headquarters in Paris since 1889. Le Grand K has been removed from under its glass cloche in the Parisian basement three times since its conception, to create secondary copies. These first generation kilogram babies are then weighed against each other once every five years and used to create tertiary copies, which are ordered and shipped around the world so that each nation can create their own standard kilograms.\n\nTap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Miramax / Via Giphy\n\nThere are several problems with this, not least of which is the fact that Le Grand K appears to have gained weight.\n\nThe platinum-iridium cylinder seems to have collected pollutants from the air, which has led to weight gains of tens of micrograms since it became the universal standard. Scientists know this because when they have measured the secondary babies agains Le Grand K, they have noticed a widening gap in weight. Professor Jared Cole, a quantum physicist from RMIT University in Melbourne, told BuzzFeed News that this is a fundamental problem with our current weight system. \"Either all of the secondary standards are getting slightly lighter over time ... or the primary standard is getting heavier. And because the primary standard is the definition of the kilogram, we can't tell the difference between those two things.\" Measurements were first defined by things we observed in the world \u2013 the metre was originally a fraction of the distance from the North Pole to the equator, and a second was originally a fraction of the time it took the Earth to rotate on its axis. However, these were found to be imprecise: one of the first metres was off by 1/5 of a millimetre, and the Earth's rotation isn't consistent. Both the metre and the second are now defined by mathematical constants. The second is now measured based on the radiation cycles produced by the caesium-133 atom, and the metre is measured as the speed of light against a fraction of that second (the distance that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second, if you really have to know).

However, I never realized just how much dinge and schmutz marred my beautiful diamond until I cleaned it. It literally took my breath away with its fiery, dazzling brilliance! My wedding ring is something that always makes my heart beat a little faster: for its beauty, for what it represents...and now, my smile is even bigger and my heart skips a beat a little more as I gaze upon this amazing clarity.

I am not a medical professional, so talk to your doctor if you think you\u2019re depressed. But I do hope this can help you or someone you know who may have a mood disorder, and that it might shed a little light on such a cloudy subject.\n\n1. Generally speaking, a lot of people misunderstand depression. So while you are dealing with depression, chances are you will run into some people who have some misconceptions about it. \"Why don't you just get out and get some exercise?\" is just one of the many typical questions you might hear from people who don't fully understand depression as a mood disorder. There is a huge misconception that depression has to do with how much willpower you may or may not have, when it does not. But a lot of people won't know this, and you may even surprise yourself with what you didn't know or understand about depression. There's a lot of stigma surrounding discussions on mental health, and having a conversation about it is important.\n\n2. Sharing your experience with depression will probably be a lot different from what you had imagined. Even if you post about mental health for BuzzFeed like I do, it's still not easy. You may feel embarrassed and would rather keep it to yourself for now, or share the diagnosis with just a handful of people until you feel comfortable with it. Experiencing mental health issues is NO different from having physical health issues, and you won't know exactly how you'll react when you're going through it.\n\n3. Other people's reactions may also be different from what you expected. It happens. Even people who have depression themselves may react negatively, for example. You can use that as a filter to distance yourself from people who aren't good for you anyway, and try to build your relationships with those who do you good. But only do so after you've taken care of yourself and are feeling nourished. There's no rush; in time, everything will come together.\n\nEva Uviedo\n\n4. Depression can slip under your radar, especially if you already happen to be an introvert. People who are depressed might cry, spend a lot of their time in quiet and experience fatigue from time to time, but so can people who aren\u2019t depressed. Check this list of depression symptoms to find out more. But not everyone will exhibit all these symptoms and/or symptoms won't always be so obvious \u2014 especially if you are already the introverted or withdrawn type.\n\n5. You NEED to ask for help, but that requires a lot of strength, especially if your mind is telling you otherwise. Depending on how you're feeling, you may not really even feel like getting help. But ask for help. Please. Talk to a friend, a therapist, or contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. What you're feeling are the symptoms of an illness. You are not feeling like yourself. This is not who you really are. There is treatment for it. And yes, as is the case with many other illnesses, depression can also be chronic, but there is treatment to help you get relief and feel better. Asking for help requires a great deal of inner strength, and even more so when you don't feel like helping yourself, but please tap into this strength and get help. You would seek treatment if you had a bad case of the flu or a broken bone. It's no different with mental health.\n\n6. It might take some time before you and your doctor find the right treatment for you, but you'll know when it starts working. And it will. There are various forms of treatment and a handful of antidepressants that can be prescribed. If your psychiatrist prescribes you one, you might get it right on the first try, but it also might take a few tries before you find the one that's right for you. A friend told me that as soon as he started taking medication everything changed, just like that. It wasn't quite like that for me on the first try, not even the second, or the third. But when it finally kicked in, it was practically instantaneous. Keep in mind it can take 4 to 6 weeks, or longer, for some antidepressants to start working. Talk to your doctor about when you might see an improvement.\n\nEva Uviedo\n\n7. Even while I was receiving treatment for depression, I still had great days and bad days. The first change I noticed is that l started experiencing more days where I felt happy and upbeat \u2013 which didn't happen very much, if at all, before treatment. Keep in mind that you might still have sad & gloomy gray days, even if treatment is going well. It's important to communicate well with the professionals who are helping you, so that they can help you understand how normal ups and downs are and when they occur. But it really is such a beautiful thing to be able to have those good days.\n\n8. Apart from medical treatment, I also found it helpful to go to therapy to talk things through. Since I write for a living, I've always exercised this skill regularly, for better or worse. But the dynamic completely changes when you have to start talking about the abstract things you're feeling and thinking, and having to articulate them. For that reason, I found psychotherapy was essential in conjunction with medical treatment. You might find you are able to express yourself through talking, writing, or drawing, even if you don\u2019t think you have it in you. Reading The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath really helped me. It is a largely biographical story of a woman's experience with depression. This book put a lot of what I was feeling into words.\n\n9. You may have forgotten who you really are because of this illness. After treatment started to take effect, I heard four people near and dear to my heart tell me that I was back to being the person they knew. They all said it in their own little way of course, and all of them \u2013 perhaps without realizing it \u2013 really touched me. For me, depression is like a thick fog that not only darkened my days, but my memories as well. Today I am rediscovering who I am, because it's as if I had almost completely forgotten. What did I like to read? What music did I listen to? What made me laugh? All of this is a bit new \u2013 and it sure makes for lots of conversation with my therapist and my psychiatrist.\n\nEva Uviedo\n\n10. Each person is an individual, and every depressed person is an individual with depression, which is why no two cases are exactly the same. This post talks about my own personal experience with depression. Hopefully, just being able to find out that someone may be going through something similar is a comforting thought, and it's the reason I am writing this for you. Ask for help, because it can get better.\n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.
