While uncommon in humans, those infected with the virus can suffer \u201csevere brain damage or death if the patient is not treated soon after exposure,\u201d according to the CDC.\n\nThe infection can spread from monkey to human by the \u201ctransmission of bodily fluids, which is possible through bites and scratches or other contact with bodily fluids,\u201d the university explains online.\n\nThere have been at least 50 documented incidents of people who have contracted the Herpes B virus after being bitten or scratched by an infected rhesus macaques monkey in a lab. Nearly half of those cases resulted in death, while others \u201csuffered permanent neurological damage,\u201d according to the university.\n\nWhile \u201cthe risk of transmission of Herpes B from macaques to humans is uncertain,\u201d and there has \u201cnever been a confirmed report of a human contracting Herpes B from a macaque in the wild\u201d thus far, according to the University of Florida, experts warned in the study that the growing population could put park-goers at an elevated risk if the population remains uncontrolled.\n\nIn the past, state officials have attempted to control the community of monkeys, especially after the population reached roughly 400 in the 1980s. At the time, trappers were given permission to capture the monkeys. Many female rhesus macaques were sterilized, while others were sold to biomedical research facilities \u2014 a practice that \u201cgenerated a great deal of public controversy and has since halted,\u201d the university said.\n\nJane Anderson, a wildlife ecologist and assistant professor of research at Texas A&M University-Kingsville, told National Geographic the population could be better controlled \u2014 reduced to a \u201cthird of its current size\u201d \u2014 if just half of the female rhesus macaques in the area were again sterilized. Others options include removing the monkeys entirely.\n\nBut some local residents are opposed to removing the primates.\n\nCALIFORNIA MAN SAVES 'SHIVERING' MULE FROM DROWNING IN POOL AFTER DEVASTATING CAMP FIRE\n\n\u201cThese monkeys have been here 80 years, and they didn\u2019t choose to come here, so I don't think it\u2019s fair for us to get rid of them because we don't like them anymore,\u201d Debbie Walters, a guide with Captain Tom\u2019s Custom Charters, told National Geographic.\n\n\u201cA lot of other animals cause disease, and we don't kill them,\u201d she added."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "German prosecutors seek to lift immunity of far-right leader", "description": "German prosecutors said Wednesday they are seeking to lift the parliamentary immunity of a prominent far-right politician as part of a probe into potentially illegal campaign donations.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/german-prosecutors-seek-to-lift-immunity-of-far-right-leader", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:27:16Z", "content": "BERLIN German prosecutors said Wednesday they are seeking to lift the parliamentary immunity of a prominent far-right politician as part of a probe into potentially illegal campaign donations.

Jeff Flake on Wednesday vowed to pull support for all federal judicial nominees -- including 21 pending in the Judiciary Committee and 32 awaiting a vote on the Senate floor -- unless the Senate's GOP leadership permits consideration of legislation to expand protections for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's job.\n\nThe dramatic move by Flake, considered a potential primary challenger to President Trump in 2020, came immediately after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked his effort to introduce the bill for consideration by unanimous consent, which requires the approval of all 100 senators.\n\nMcConnell said the legislation, also backed by Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, is unnecessary because Trump has not suggested he will fire Mueller. (Other conservative commentators have suggested that the law would be unconstitutional, on the separation-of-powers theory that Congress does not have the authority to strip the president of the authority to fire Executive Branch officials he oversees.)\n\n\"Sen. Coons and I are prepared to make it again and again until there is a vote on this vital, bipartisan legislation on the Senate floor,\" Flake said in a speech just weeks before his imminent retirement. \"And I have informed the majority leader I will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting confirmation on the Senate Floor until S. 2644 is brought to the full Senate for a vote.\"\n\nDOJ OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL SAYS IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL FOR TRUMP TO APPOINT WHITAKER WITHOUT SENATE APPROVAL\n\nHe added: \"We have been told that the bill ... is not necessary, as there have been no indications that the independence of Mr. Mueller's investigation is in jeopardy. That may have been an arguable position before last week. But it is not arguable anymore.\n\n\"With the firing of the attorney general ... the president now has this investigation in his sights and we all know it,\" he continued. \"How such an investigation can be the cause of controversy is beyond me. ... Presidents do not get to determine what gets investigated and what and who does not.\"\n\n\"The President now has this investigation in his sights, and we all know it.\" \u2014 Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.\n\nWednesday's threat wasn't the first from Flake, who will be replaced in January by Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. In June, he told ABC News that he was considering using judicial nominees as leverage over trade policy. (\"I think myself and a number of senators, at least a few of us, will stand up and say let's not move any more judges until we get a vote, for example, on tariffs,\" Flake said this summer.)\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES PICK TO REPLACE KAVANAUGH ON D.C. CIRCUIT: THE 'CZAR' OF HIS DE-REGULATION AGENDA\n\nFlake was a key vote to confirm Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and he is the swing vote on the Judiciary Committee, where Republicans hold a slim 11-10 majority. The Senate, which has the exclusive power to confirm federal nominees by a simple majority vote, will be in session for another week in November and about two more weeks in December.\n\nThe pending judicial nominees do not need majority support on the Judiciary Committee to advance to a final confirmation vote on the Senate floor, where Republicans are set to retain their majority next term. However, nominations that do not have the committee's approval tend to move slower.\n\nJudiciary Committee Press Secretary George Hartmann wrote on Twitter that the committee is planning to vote on a set of nominees soon.\n\n\"As for the nominees in committee on tomorrow's [Judiciary Committee] agenda, they are all expected to be held over one week under the committee rules (which do not require a vote),\" Hartmann wrote. \"They would, however, be ready for a committee vote at the following business meeting (likely Nov. 29).\"\n\nTop Democrats and some Republicans have called on Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who replaced Jeff Sessions, to recuse himself from oversight of the Russia investigation. Whitaker has written critically of Mueller's probe, which he now oversees.\n\nThe bill Flake advocated, which has been stalled in the Judiciary Committee since earlier this year, would have mandated an expedited judicial review of any decision by Trump to fire Mueller. If the termination was found to be without cause, the legislation would restore Mueller's job.\n\nSCHUMER THREATENS TO ADD MUELLER PROTECTIONS TO SPENDING BILL\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said this week that if Whitaker does not recuse himself, Democrats will seek to tie protections for the investigation into the critical spending bill that funds the federal government -- potentially setting up a government shutdown.\n\n\"We Democrats, House and Senate, will attempt to add to must-pass legislation, in this case the spending bill, legislation that would prevent Mr. Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation\" should Whitaker not recuse, Schumer said Sunday during an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nUnder current Justice Department guidelines, Mueller's termination would ostensibly have to come from Whitaker or another high-level DOJ official.\n\nBut one of the bill's co-sponsors, North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Thillis, sided with McConnell in saying that there's no rush to pass the bill.\n\n\"I don't think the president has any intention of removing Mueller,\" Thillis said. \"I'm all about getting this on the books so no future President can make that kind of a bad decision. ... I've had discussion with the president. Everyone said it was hours away back in August. Didn't happen. So I think it's another false crisis.

That's a worrying indicator for May, who will likely require support from opposition Labour members of Parliament to win final approval of the agreement.\n\nPro-Brexit lawmakers in May's Conservative Party say the agreement will leave Britain tethered to the EU after it departs and unable to forge an independent trade policy. In a warning to her opponents, May said the choice was between her deal, \"or leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who resigned earlier this year amid disagreements with May about Brexit strategy, told ITV News Wednesday that the draft agreement was \"vassal state stuff.\"\n\n\"We are going to be kept in a kind of economic and political captivity, unable to shape EU legislation and regulation, but having to accept it,\" Johnson said. \" ... I cannot see how, in a month of Sundays, that can be acceptable to anybody who campaigned for Brexit. I can't see how it would be acceptable to anybody who believes in self-government for this country, let alone the Union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\"\n\nLeading Euroskeptic Conservative legislator Jacob Rees-Mogg urged his colleagues to vote against the deal, saying it \"will lock us into an EU customs union and EU laws. This will prevent us pursuing a U.K. trade policy based around our priorities and economy.\"\n\nNigel Farage, former leader of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party (UKIP) tweeted Thursday evening: \"Any cabinet member who is a genuine Brexiteer must now resign or never be trusted again, this is the worst deal in history.\"\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who opposed the 2016 referendum to leave the EU, said the proposed deal \"would be a bad one for Scotland, taking us out of a single market eight times the size of the UK market alone and posing a huge threat to jobs, investment and living standards\n\nMay's supporters argue that the deal is the best on offer, and the alternatives are a chaotic \"no-deal\" Brexit that would cause massive disruption to people and businesses or a general election that could see the Conservative government replaced by Labour, making far-left leader Jeremy Corbyn Prime Minister.\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary William Hague warned \"ardent Brexiteers\" that if they shoot down May's deal, it could lead to a change of government and a new referendum and \"Brexit might never happen at all.\"\n\nIn addition to Parliament, leaders of the 28-nation EU must also approve the deal. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier declared there had been \"decisive progress,\" signaling that EU leaders can convene a summit to approve the deal, probably later his month. If all sides approve, the agreement would come into effect on March 29 of next year.\n\nCrucially, Barnier said that \"we have now found a solution together with the U.K. to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.\"\n\nThe main obstacle to a withdrawal agreement has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland's hard-won peace process.\n\nThe solution in the agreement involves a \"single EU-U.K. customs territory,\" to eliminate the need for border checks.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the U.K. will agree to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental standards and workplace protections -- another source of anger for Brexiteers, who say Britain should be free to set its own rules.\n\nThe draft agreement also mentions potential \"Northern Ireland-specific regulatory alignment\" to avoid a hard border.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government, has said it will oppose any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the U.K. after Brexit.\n\n\"We could not as unionists support a deal that broke up the United Kingdom,\" DUP leader Arlene Foster said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Cuba ends medical exchange program with Brazil", "description": "Cuba said Wednesday that it is ending a program that sent thousands of government doctors to underserved regions of Brazil in exchange for hundreds of millions in badly needed hard currency.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/cuba-ends-medical-exchange-program-with-brazil", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:47:21Z", "content": "HAVANA Cuba said Wednesday that it is ending a program that sent thousands of government doctors to underserved regions of Brazil in exchange for hundreds of millions in badly needed hard currency.

He takes office Jan. 1.\n\nCuba made the announcement after Bolsonaro said the program overseen by the World Health Organization could only continue if doctors directly received their salaries from Brazil, and were able to bring their families with them during their assignments, among other conditions.\n\nThe Cuban government generally keeps most of the salaries of state employees working abroad as part of the socialist state's \"international missions.\" Participants also are generally barred from bringing family members in a measure that critics say is designed to prevent doctors from emigrating.\n\n\"Mas Medicos\" started five years ago under leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Cuba said roughly 20,000 doctors saw millions of patients in areas such as the Amazon rainforest and slums of major cities.\n\nCuba maintains similar missions in 67 other countries but \"Mas Medicos\" was one of the largest and most important, serving as a link between the cash-strapped island and South America's largest economy.\n\n\"Cubans have provided a valuable service to the Brazilian people with dignity, deep sensitivity, professionality, dedication and altruism,\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. \"Such humane acts should be respected and defended.\"\n\nAll Cuban doctors work for the state and virtually all receive salaries that are well below $100 a month. Doctors are not permitted to leave Cuba without government permission, a control that was lifted for virtually all other Cubans five years ago.\n\nThousands of Cuban doctors work in the island's public health-care system, which suffers from crumbling infrastructure but still provides free and universal health care to all citizens. Thousands of other Cuban doctors go abroad each year and generate billions of dollars for the state, one of Cuba's most important sources of foreign exchange.\n\nThe doctors generally receive a fraction of the salary paid to the Cuban government. But even that fraction far exceeds the salaries of doctors working in Cuba. That drives many doctors to complete foreign missions in order to earn cash for important expenses like home repairs, appliances or a motor vehicle.\n\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Health said there were 8,332 Cuban doctors in Brazil, each costing the country roughly $3,100 a month, plus room and board.\n\nBolsonaro said Brazil would offer asylum to Cuban doctors who wished to stay in Brazil.\n\n\"This is slave labor,\" he said. \"We couldn't be accomplices.\"\n\nNeither side said exactly when the Cuban doctors would be leaving but their departure comes at a bad time for Cuba, which is facing its third year of slow growth, expected to be around 1 percent this year. Productivity is low in virtually every state-run industry, tourism has slowed under the Trump administration and Venezuela, a key ally, has cut back on subsidized oil and other aid.\n\nNonetheless, Bolsonaro's conditions were out of the question for Cuba.\n\n\"It's not acceptable to question the dignity, professionalism and altruism of Cubans who, with the support of their families, provide services in 67 countries,\" the Cuban health ministry said in a statement. \"The Brazilian people will understand who bears the responsibility for the fact that our doctors can't keep providing their support and solidarity in that nation.\"\n\n_______\n\nDe Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The lack of warning is suspected of playing a role in the Lion Air crash, when the plane plunged into the Jakarta Sea shortly after takeoff. It was the first fatal crash involving one of Boeing\u2019s newest aircraft and claimed 189 lives.\n\nThe Journal also reported on Tuesday that when Boeing decided to install the flight-control feature, the company determined that it was fail-proof because it was impossible for the combination of sensor failure, pilot actions, and automated nose-down commands to cause any serious safety hazards.\n\nThe newspaper also reviews a Nov. 10 Memo from Southwest Airlines, one of the U.S. carriers to start using the MAX jets, in which it\u2019s claimed that Boeing had omitted information from flight manuals about the new flight control system, because pilots were unlikely to find themselves in any situation that would require them to use the system.\n\nIn response to the fatal crash, the Federal Flight Administration (FAA) has launched a comprehensive review of safety analysis completed by Boeing Co. On Tuesday, it released a statement saying that agency officials were reviewing safety data and conclusions that the jet manufacturer previously provided to the federal agency during certification of both the 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 models.\n\n\u201cThe existing FAA Airworthiness Directive (AD) identifies existing flight crew procedures to be used in those circumstances,\u201d reads a statement from administration officials. \u201cThe FAA and Boeing continue to evaluate the need for software and/or other design changes to the aircraft including operating procedures and training as we learn more from the ongoing investigation.

About 15 minutes into the flight, which took off from Jakarta, the plane plunged into the sea.\n\nThere are more than 200 Boeing MAX jets around the world, with orders for more than 4,700, according to Boeing\u2019s website.

But that's a pledge that should hardly be trusted, many officials contend.\n\nGiven those security concerns, selecting a 12-person jury was, not surprisingly, no easy affair. On Tuesday, two jurors ahead to be replaced ahead of opening statements. One juror, who was kept despite bursting into tears last week, presented a medical note for dismissal. Another expressed financial hardship.\n\nDuring jury selection, one member of the jury pool was rushed to hospital after suffering a panic attack. Several potential jurors expressed \u201cextreme anxiety,\u201d and another said she was \u201cnervous,\u201d and feared for her family because they lived close to the courthouse. That's where Chapo is being kept, in a newly-built basement cell to avoid traffic disruptions.\n\nSome admitted to having googled search terms related to Chapo and killing jurors. Others said they were worried about identifying factors already having been made public. One would-be juror said co-workers had already suspected she was in the final selection group \u2013 made up of U.S. citizens from Brooklyn, Long Island, and Staten Island.\n\nAt the Brooklyn courthouse, where he sits in his solitary cell, swarms of security officers and bomb-sniffing dogs are patrolling around the clock. And those measures are expected to be in place for at least four months - the expected length of the trial.\n\n\u201cThe Eastern Division New York Police Department (EDNY) and the U.S. Marshals Service are very experienced with high-profile trials and related jury safety and tampering issues,\u201d said Derek Maltz, former Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration Special Operations Division in New York. \u201cBut in the current world we live in, with information access and leaks, I would be concerned from the juror\u2019s perspective, since there are so many ways to disclose the identities of the people.\u201d\n\nThe Marshals Service, a Department of Justice agency, serves as the main agency for federal fugitive operations, the protection of officers of the federal judiciary, and the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System. That all puts the Guzm\u00e1n trial in their sphere of security.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n has pleaded not guilty to all 17 counts in the indictment, which accuses him of heading global operations for Mexico\u2019s infamous Sinaloa Cartel. The U.S. had to quietly drop homicide charges from his indictment to ensure death penalty was taken off the table, making the extradition possible.\n\nThe accused drug kingpin has long been known to have ordered the brutal murders of dozens \u2013 rivals, dissidents, suspected snitches, government officials or anyone who might have mildly fallen into his crosshairs. He has twice escaped from Mexico\u2019s prisons, and effectively ran his cartel business and ordered killings from behind bars. As a result, he's currently in solitary confinement 23 hours per day.\n\nMANIPULATION, FEAR, SNITCHES, AND A NEW CELL: BEHIND THE SCENES AS EL CHAPO GOES TO TRIAL\n\nQUESTIONS ARISE OVER POLITICS, MOTIVATION OF CARAVAN ORGANIZERS\n\nRobert Clark, retired FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Los Angeles bureau, said Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s destructive impact on human lives spanned into the thousands \u2013 and that\u2019s just on the direct scale.\n\n\u201cIf you consider the fact he was the largest supplier of cocaine and marijuana, he has negatively impacted millions of lives,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe violence has touched so many. However, the fear that the Sinaloa Cartel perpetrates is immeasurable.\u201d\n\nClark also pointed out the jury \u201cwill be most difficult to seat the protect.\u201d He also predicted that \u201cwithin the jury, corruption will be an issue. The influence of Sinaloa and Chapo is vast and deep,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prosecutors especially will have to be very careful - the threat is very real.\u201d\n\nSinaloa is believed to have a network worldwide, including cells inside the United States.\n\n\u201cThese people think nothing of killing anyone they don\u2019t like, man or woman,\u201d one U.S. official said. \u201cThey\u2019ll decapitate, cut limbs off, shoot, drown, cut you up. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\n\nDuring earlier hearings, which Guzm\u00e1n often attended, law enforcement officials expressed concern over some of the \u201cfreelance journalists\u201d in attendance. They speculated that some may have been or were working for cartel snoops, trying to ascertain early information to identify jurors, or forge relationships with those in the know.\n\nFederal Judge Brian Mr. Cogan, 64, who has served on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York since 2006, is handling the case, and his known for his ruthless efficiency, calm temperament and compassion.

Security and safety are their number one priority. They always do a great job and know exactly what is needed to protect the public and those involved with the trial,\u201d said Joaquin Garcia, a retired FBI Special Agent and Managing Director at Pathfinder Consultants International, Inc.\n\nLenny DePaul, a retired Chief Inspector and Commander of the Marshals Service in New York, concurred.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m well aware of the capabilities of the Marshals Service, and what they will do to keep them (the jurors) completely obscured from the public,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will never be identified publicly, unless they come forward post-trial.\u201d\n\nBut that is where the trouble could begin. Long after the verdict is handed down, those involved will have to watch their backs - and their mouths.\n\n\u201cSome of the jurors should be careful after the trial; if they think about capitalizing on big paydays for playing a role in the drug trial of the century. This is where it will become very dangerous,\u201d Maltz said. \u201cThey should do their job, enjoy the opportunity and keep a low profile.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Andrew O'reilly", "title": "Kevin McCarthy defeats Jim Jordan in race for House minority leader", "description": "Rep.

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., beat back a challenge from dark horse candidate, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Wednesday for the role of House minority leader, with Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., nabbing the title of GOP conference chairman.\n\nDuring a closed-door session with House Republicans, the California lawmaker took a decisive victory against Jordan, bringing in 159 votes to the Ohio representative\u2019s 43 votes.\n\nMcCarthy was initially elected to the House in 2006 and has served as the House majority leader since 2014. Jordan is a prominent member of the House Freedom Caucus and an ally of President Trump.\n\nMcCarthy \"knows what he needs to do,\" said GOP Whip Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who was gravely wounded in last year's congressional baseball practice shooting. On Tuesday, Scalise unanimously won re-election to the No. 2 spot as whip.\n\n\"You always look in the mirror and see what you can do better,\" Scalise said Tuesday. Republicans, he said, \"need to do a better job of letting people know what we stand for.\"\n\nMcCarthy takes over the role of GOP leader in the House with the retirement of current House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and at a time when Republicans will be the minority party in the lower of Congress for the first time since 2011.\n\nMcCarthy enjoyed the backing of the retiring Ryan, who earlier this year called the California Republican the \u201cright person\u201d to lead the party in the House, and also a close relationship with both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe new minority leader has spent much of his political career paying it forward by holding fundraisers and championing the pet bills of other GOP lawmakers.\n\nOne issue that was seen as standing in his way to the leadership role was that he is a moderate \u2013 some would argue at times liberal \u2013 Republican in a party that has in recent years trended farther and farther toward the right. Some members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus cited his moderate views as a reason why he wasn\u2019t selected for Republican leadership during a failed 2015 bid.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not speaker now because he\u2019s got a fairly liberal Republican track record,\u201d Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., a member of the Freedom Caucus, told a local Alabama radio station earlier this year.\n\nThis opened up the door for Jordan, a founding member and former chair of the Freedom Caucus, to try to upset McCarthy in the battle for GOP leadership.\n\nWhile Jordan enjoyed support from members of his own Freedom Caucus - and from having a smaller and more conservative Republican minority in the House - he simply didn't have wide enough support to defeat McCarthy.\n\n\u201cJordan comes with a lot of baggage,\u201d Bruce Oppenheimer, a professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University, told Fox News. \u201cRepublicans now have to work with a Democratic majority and they are going to have to decide if they want somebody who is both substantively more conservative, but also extremely more unreasonable in the leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a loose cannon,\u201d he added. \u201cJordan is a bomb thrower.\u201d\n\nThe election of Cheney makes her the only woman in House Republican leadership \u2014 and has her following in the footsteps of her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who won the same post more than 30 years ago.\n\nCheney is expected to spearhead the House GOP\u2019s communications strategy when Democrats take over the chamber in January. House Republicans are looking for a more forceful approach to communications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the way that we operate and really in some ways be more aggressive, have more of a rapid response,\u201d Cheney told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\nCheney ran unopposed after the current chair of the conference, Rep.

Fortunately, the disease remains rare: This year, there have been 90 cases spread among 27 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nIt's not clear what's causing some children to lose the ability to move their face, neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms tend to occur about a week after the children had a fever and respiratory illness.\n\nUTAH BOY ACCIDENTAL SWALLOWS FIDGET MAGNETS WHILE HIDING TOY FROM BROTHER\n\nHealth officials call the condition acute flaccid myelitis. No one has died from it this year, but CDC officials say at least half the patients do not recover from the paralysis and some have serious complications.\n\nPolio and West Nile virus have been ruled out. Doctors have suspected the cause might be some kind of enterovirus, which in most people causes cold symptoms. But CDC officials say that's not clear.\n\nThe first mysterious wave of paralysis cases in 2014 coincided with a wider spike in illnesses connected to an enterovirus called EV-D68, CDC officials said. But there was no such spike during the waves in 2016 or this year.\n\nThere's also a lack of clinical evidence: CDC officials have checked the spinal fluid of about three-quarters of the 90 patients, and found EV-68 in only one. Another type of enterovirus called EV-A71 was found in only one other patient.\n\nBut there are questions about that, too. If a virus is the cause, it's possible the test is not good enough, or the germ left the spinal fluid by the time the tests were taken, said the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier. It's also possible the culprit is hiding elsewhere in the body.\n\nOr perhaps the paralyzing illnesses are caused by some new germ for which no lab test has been developed. Or maybe there's some predisposing factor in some patients that cause their immune systems to react so severely to a germ or other trigger that the immune response causes paralysis, CDC officials said.\n\nUS OFFICIALS REPORT A RECORD NUMBER OF TICK DISEASES\n\nParents and even some scientists have criticized the agency for not solving the riddle.\n\n\"I understand why parents are frustrated. I'm frustrated. I want answers too,\" said Messonnier, who is overseeing the agency's outbreak investigation. CDC officials have pledged to do more to notify doctors to look for possible cases and to more thoroughly review cases from years past for further clues.\n\nAbout 120 cases were confirmed in 2014, the first time such a wave occurred. Another 149 were reported in 2016. In 2015 and 2017, the counts were far lower, and it's not clear why.\n\nThe illnesses have spiked in September each year there's been a wave and tailed off significantly by November. But it can take weeks to determine which cases should be counted in the outbreak. More than 160 cases are still being investigated, and some of those may join the count, CDC officials said."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Cristina Corbin", "title": "Wisconsin police baffled by Jayme Closs disappearance one month after parents' murder - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Wisconsin police baffled by Jayme Closs disappearance one month after parents' murder Fox News It began with a cryptic 911 call from Denise Closs's cell phone.

We heard voices but we can\u2019t make out what was said,\" he said, adding that it sounded as though the call was made in a room separate from the commotion.\n\n\"We do believe Jayme was home at the time the call was made,\" Fitzgerald noted.\n\nWith no suspects, no sighting of the child and scarce physical evidence one month after the Oct. 15 murders, police in the small town of Barron are scrutinizing the few clues they have, starting with the mysterious 911 call and a front door riddled with bullet holes.\n\nFitzgerald would not say whether the killer shot through the door but local news footage shows investigators carrying it away from the scene -- covered with what looks like bullet holes. Fitzgerald confirmed to Fox News that the door was undergoing forensic analysis. He also would not elaborate on the type of gun used in the crimes, citing the sensitivity of the investigation. James Closs kept hunting rifles inside the home but all have been accounted for.\n\n\"There\u2019s not a lot of physical evidence,\" he said. \"We took the door and anything that they [the killer] possibly could have touched.\"\n\nBoth mother and daughter attended a family birthday party at around 4 p.m. on Oct. 14 at the home of Denise Closs's sister, Jennifer Smith, who lives on the other side of town. At around 10 p.m. that night, Smith spoke with Closs by phone from her home. Nothing appeared amiss, according to family and police.\n\n\"At 10 p.m. we know everybody was at the house and accounted for,\" Fitzgerald told Fox News.\n\nAt just past 1 a.m. local time on Oct. 15, the 911 call was placed to the sheriff\u2019s office from Denise Closs's cell. When the call ended abruptly, a dispatcher called the landline at the family's home but it was disconnected.\n\nPolice arrived four minutes after the initial call to the Closs home on Highway 8 and found the body of James Closs in the front doorway; his wife's was inside the home. There was no sign of Jayme, except for her cell phone, which was reportedly found plugged into an outlet in the kitchen.\n\nThe motive of the crime remains elusive. With two parents dead, their young daughter missing and no obvious sign of theft at the home, investigators are struggling to answer a key question: Why?\n\n\"I\u2019m really looking to see if they were targeted or if it was a random attack,\" Fitzgerald said. \"This is the question I think about every night before I go to bed.\"\n\n\"It appears targeted but I can't 100 percent say that it is,\" he said. \"And I don't know who the target was.\"\n\nRelatives of the Closs family, meanwhile, said they are conviced the brutal murders and apparent abduction were carefully planned.\n\n\"If this was random, it wouldn't -- there'd be more evidence,\" Steve Naiberg, the girl's uncle, said in an exclusive interview Monday with Fox affiliate KMSP-TV and other family members.\n\n\"I think this was targeted -- planned,\" said Suzi Allard, Jayme's aunt.\n\nA relative described Denise Closs to Fox News as the \"family angel.\" The 46-year-old mother \"would take off work days if you needed help,\" said the relative, who wished to remain anonymous.\n\nThe family also strongly refuted a local rumor that Jayme -- described as quiet and well-liked -- had a secret, older boyfriend, according to the station.\n\n\u201cWe just want Jayme home,\" added Smith. \"We want to know why all of this happened -- just wish we had some answers and hoping for that miracle of Jayme coming home.\"\n\nFox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Cristina Johnson", "title": "Executive Editor Of RealClearPolitics Tom Bevan: Midterm Polling Was Pretty Good", "description": "Tom Bevan, Executive Editor Of Realclearpolitics.com, joined Fox News Radio's Marie Harf to discuss polling the midterm election.

In a 45-minute video leaked by Gizmodo, Amazon\u2019s anti-union tactics were revealed, as Whole Foods team leaders were instructed in how to quell unionization after Amazon bought the company.\"\n\nThe duo called on the public to see correspondences between the Cuomo administration and Amazon to learn more about what promises have been made.\n\nThe New York State Republican Party's spokesperson, in an email to Fox News, also called it the \"worst example yet in a very long line of disastrous corporate welfare giveaways under Cuomo while New York continues to rank dead last in business friendliness with the highest taxes & regs, worst economic outlook and most outmigration.\"\n\nAmazon, which revealed Long Island City and Northern Virginia as the locations of its next headquarters in a formal announcement Tuesday, boasted that their investments \u201cwill spur the creation of tens of thousands of additional jobs in the surrounding communities\u201d -- and that hiring will begin in 2019.\n\n\u201cThese two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come,\u201d Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, said in a statement. \u201cThe team did a great job selecting these sites, and we look forward to becoming an even bigger part of these communities.\u201d\n\nFor the New York location, the company says it will generate 25,000 full-time jobs and $2.5 billion in Amazon investment, as well as an \u201cestimated incremental tax revenue of more than $10 billion over the next 20 years as a result of Amazon\u2019s investment and job creation.\"\n\nAmazon also appears to be taking advantage of a federal \"opportunity zone.\" The Associated Press says much of the Long Island City neighborhood falls into that designation, which was created in President Trump's tax overhaul and offers developers up to millions of dollars in capital gains tax breaks for investing in areas with high poverty and low incomes.\n\n\"Amazon has agreed to donate space on its campus for a tech startup incubator and for use by artists and industrial businesses, and Amazon will donate a site for a new primary or intermediary public school,\u201d the company added, noting that it will \u201calso invest in infrastructure improvements and new green spaces.\u201d\n\nBut each of those new jobs are expected to cost New Yorkers $48,000 each, and are part of a larger package of more than $1.5 billion in taxpayer-funded incentives which include such freebies as a helipad on or near the development sites.\n\n\u201cWe should be demanding that they give back to the community and not drain public resources. Instead we got played,\u201d lamented Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, in a statement obtained by Fox News.\n\n\u201cAmazon can afford to come here without handouts,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to think that such a great city would need to beg them to come.\u201d\n\nCuomo, in Amazon\u2019s statement, said: \u201cWith an average salary of $150,000 per year for the tens of thousands of new jobs Amazon is creating in Queens, economic opportunity and investment will flourish for the entire region.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio hailed the tech giant\u2019s announcement as a \u201cgiant step on our path to building an economy in New York City that leaves no one behind.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to use this opportunity to open up good careers in tech to thousands of people looking for their foothold in the new economy, including those in City colleges and public housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe City and State are working closely together to make sure Amazon\u2019s expansion is planned smartly, and to ensure this fast growing neighborhood has the transportation, schools, and infrastructure it needs.\u201d\n\nHowever, New York City council members \u2013 who have the power to modify land-use projects in the city \u2013 say Cuomo and De Blasio gave them the runaround when it came to the Amazon deal.\n\n\u201cI find that lack of engagement and the fact that the negotiations excluded the City Council \u2013 which is elected by New Yorkers to guide land-use projects with communities in mind \u2013 extremely troubling,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nCuomo, at a press conference announcing the deal Tuesday, said it was arranged through a state government mechanism allowing it to bypass the council.\n\n\"It\u2019s done by [Empire State Development] in consultation with the city and the community,\" Cuomo said. \"But it expedites the process and here the expedition factor was a factor in the competition, right? Because Amazon wanted to move to a place where they knew they would have an expedited facility being constructed and that\u2019s our way of doing it.\"\n\nJohnson reportedly was among the invitees to that press conference Tuesday at Cuomo\u2019s New York City office \u2013 but he and other council members appeared to give the governor the cold shoulder by not attending.\n\nJonathan Tepper, an investor and author of the book \"The Myth of Capitalism,\" said of the agreement: \"Amazon's HQ2 makes me want to vomit. It perfectly captures how corrupt American crony capitalism has become.\n\n\"The government should not be in the business of throwing money at businesses to 'create jobs' -- that is what businesses are supposed to do as a matter of course,\" he added.\n\nThose living in the largest public housing project in America \u2013 only a handful of blocks away from the proposed Amazon Long Island City site -- also are skeptical as to how the incoming Amazon jobs will benefit them.\n\n\u201cThis community needs jobs, but we have trades, no degrees,\u201d Demetrius Loving, a 45-year-old resident of the Queensbridge Houses, told the New York Post. \u201cThey could save this community with that money!\u201d\n\nFox News' Chris Ciaccia contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Ryan Gaydos", "title": "Russian military jammed GPS signals during NATO war games, Norway says - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Russian military jammed GPS signals during NATO war games, Norway says Fox News Russian military units in the Arctic jammed GPS signals being used during largescale NATO exercises in Norway that ended last week, the Norwegian Defense Ministry said Tu\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-military-jammed-gps-signals-during-nato-war-games-norway-says", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/NATO-Trident-games.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:50:41Z", "content": "Russian military units in the Arctic jammed GPS signals being used during largescale NATO exercises in Norway that ended last week, the Norwegian Defense Ministry said Tuesday.

While no soldiers have been killed, he said the death toll for armed separatists may increase, as fighters escape into the bush.\n\nIn a separate incident, the mayor of Nwa, a local council in the same region, was found dead Wednesday and he is believed to have been killed by separatists, said Emmanuel Bunyui, the mayor of the nearby town of Ndu. Many mayors in English-speaking regions have been targeted by armed separatists demanding an independent English-speaking state, which they call Ambazonia.\n\n\"When we hoist the Cameroon flag in the council premises, we are targeted by the armed men who insist that we should instead display their blue and white flag,\" Bunyui said.\n\nThese incidents have highlighted the separatist unrest in Cameroon, which began in 2016, when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the northwest and southwest staged demonstrations calling for reforms, criticizing what they called the marginalization of the Anglophone population, which accounts for about one-fifth of the country's 25 million people.\n\nViolence increased after factions of separatists armed themselves following a government clampdown on protests in 2017. Armed separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions and hundreds of civilians have been killed and dozens of schools have been burned and teachers threatened.\n\nIn the past year, more than 1,200 people including separatists, police, military and gendarmes have been killed in the fighting, according to military spokesman Badjeck.\n\nRecently 79 students and three staff were kidnapped from a school by suspected separatists, and they have all now been released.\n\nMore than 100 civilians have escaped the violence and fled to the capital, Yaounde.\n\n\"I am just going to nowhere.

Her husband had been executed nine months earlier.\n\nThe auction offers a glimpse into the opulent world of the French court during its twilight years.\n\nINCREDIBLE PHOTOS OF THE LAST CZAR AND THE RUSSIAN ROYAL FAMILY SURFACE\n\nDiamond and pearl earrings, pearl necklaces and a giant pearl pendant owned by the ill-fated queen are among the heirlooms from the Bourbon-Parma dynasty to be auctioned by Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nSome of the artifacts in the auction haven't been seen publicly for 200 years, fueling interest in the sale.\n\nArguably, the highlight piece is \"Queen Marie Antoinette's Pearl,\" a diamond-and-pearl pendant estimated to fetch between $1 million and $2 million \u2014 maybe more. It features a drop-shaped, 2.58-cm (about 1-inch) natural pearl that outsizes the Peregrina that was once in Hollywood star Elizabeth Taylor's collection.\n\nThe diamond-and-pearl-pendant is believed to have been among jewels packed up when Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI prepared to flee France. Packed in a wooden box, they were transported secretly to Brussels and then to Vienna, according to Sotheby's. In Vienna the jewels came into the safekeeping of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor and Marie Antoinette's nephew.

Historians, however, believe that she never uttered the famous words \u201clet them eat cake.\u201d The quote has long been attributed to the queen, who had purportedly just been informed that her starving subjects had no bread.\n\nThis is not the first time that Marie Antoinette\u2019s jewels have been up for auction.

The Justice Department wasn\u2019t created until 1870, though an attorney general existed prior to that.\n\nThe official told Fox News that the issue was \u201cconstitutionality\u201d of the appointment.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is constitutionality,\u201d the official said. \u201cVRA unquestionably gives the president the option to do it.\u201d\n\n'VRA [Vacancies Reform Act] unequestionably gives the president the option to do it.' \u2014 Senior Justice Department official on Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general\n\nWhitaker previously served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff at the Justice Department. The president requested Sessions\u2019 resignation last week, just hours after the polls closed on Election Day. Sessions had been criticized by the president throughout his tenure at the Justice Department due to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, due to his involvement with the Trump campaign in 2016.\n\nFollowing Sessions\u2019 recusal, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut Whitaker\u2019s new role would include oversight of the Russia investigation, along with the agency\u2019s other federal investigations, including the New York prosecutors\u2019 look into the finances of Trump and his former aides.\n\nDemocrats and eighteen state attorneys general have taken issue with Whitaker\u2019s appointment, calling for him to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia probe, citing in part his \u201chostility\u201d to the investigation given his past criticism in the media.\n\nIn an op-ed Whitaker wrote last year, he argued that \u201cany investigation into President Trump\u2019s finances or the finances of his family would require Mueller to return to Rod Rosenstein for additional authority under Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time for Rosenstein\u2026to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel,\u201d Whitaker wrote. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, then Mueller\u2019s investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition. This would not only be out of character for a respected figure like Mueller, but also could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family\u2014and by extension, to the country.\u201d\n\nAnd separately, in July 2017, Whitaker told CNN, \"I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general doesn\u2019t fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Whitaker made his first public appearance as acting attorney general on Wednesday in Iowa, his home state, and delivered remarks on \u201celder justice.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The Latest: Italy's anti-migrant minister greets refugees", "description": "The Latest on migrants in Europe (all times local): 3:30 p.m. Italy's hard-line interior minister has welcomed 51 refugees and asylum-seekers who arrived in Italy after being detained in Libya and then airlifted out by the U.N. refugee agency.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-latest-italys-anti-migrant-minister-greets-refugees", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-5969f899eb6f4b0ea07ba004e1fb7f02-1.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:47:55Z", "content": "BRUSSELS The Latest on migrants in Europe (all times local): 3:30 p.m. Italy's hard-line interior minister has welcomed 51 refugees and asylum-seekers who arrived in Italy after being detained in Libya and then airlifted out by the U.N. refugee agency.

Tasteful or not, humour is one of the ways people cope with awful situations. If it's happened to them, they've every right - and probably serious need - to joke about it,\u201d someone wrote in Cleese\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cHumor is the best medicine,\u201d another user wrote.\n\n\u201cThey have a British sense of humour.

Charles turns 70 on Nov. 14. Bullen is also the co-founder and executive editor of TrueRoyalty.tv, a subscription video on demand service dedicated to chronicling the royals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks about it a lot,\u201d said Bullen. \u201cHe is a man who very much lives in the present. And all of the programs we\u2019ve made with him, he\u2019s very now. He has a job to do as the Prince of Wales, which he does willingly\u2026 If you speak to him, sure, he\u2019s aware he will be king one day, but that will come at its time. So not too much can be done now if you really think about it.\n\n\u201cAnd also, there\u2019s the fact that for him to become king, then very sadly his mother has to die. So I guess it\u2019s not something anyone wants to focus on, least of all her son\u2026 [And] when you speak with the family, you don\u2019t necessarily get the sense that he\u2019s thinking about the top job. He\u2019s thinking about how he can be the most effective Prince of Wales today\u2026 He just wants to do the job really, really well. When he becomes king, he\u2019ll do that job really, really well.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to Charles\u2019 popularity with the public, he has come a long way. While he was celebrated as one of the most sought-after eligible bachelors in the \u201870s, he was later depicted as heartless by the press during his tumultuous marriage to Princess Diana.\n\nIn 1981, nearly one billion television viewers in 74 countries witnessed the marriage of the British heir to the then-schoolteacher. But after welcoming two sons and then enduring four years of separation, the couple formally divorced in 1996. A year later, Diana died at age 36 from injuries she sustained in a car crash.\n\n\u201cI think the popularity somewhat waned [for Charles] when he married Diana because she, in many ways, became the star of the show,\u201d said Bullen. \u201cAnd he allowed her to be the star of the show. But as their marriage fell apart, and marriages do fall apart, the press needed a villain. And I think there were two villains here. One was [his ex-girlfriend] Camilla Parker Bowles and the other was the Prince of Wales.\n\n\u201c\u2026 People looked at the stories of how could this man leave this absolutely beautiful supermodel-type woman who\u2019s adored around the world for another woman, regardless of who that other woman was. So he became the villain of the piece during the Diana years. When she tragically died, again people wanted to put blame somewhere\u2026 and I think he had to live through all of that. He kept this quiet, calm approach\u2026 And during the last 10-12 years, there has been this rehabilitation\u2026 I think people now are beginning to see who he really is.\u201d\n\nCharles and Bowles married in 2005. Bullen said Charles is at peace with his marriage and completely devoted to his longtime love, 71.\n\n\u201cEveryone that we spoke to has said she\u2019s incredibly good at making him laugh,\u201d explained Bullen. \u201cShe also knows how to get him out of a bad mood. She\u2019s known him for such a long time. She\u2019s known him since the late \u201860s. It\u2019s a genuine love story. He\u2019s incredibly happy. He always refers to her as \u2018my darling wife.\u2019 She\u2019s always there for him.\u201d\n\nBullen pointed out that throughout Charles\u2019 life, he always relied on the support of a strong, loving woman.\n\n\u201cIn the early days it was the queen mother,\u201d he said. \u201cHis grandmother raised him in the early years as the queen was busy being queen. She was very good at telling him how clever he was, how funny he was, how much people like him. The queen mother really built his confidence in him.\n\n\"And from what I know, Camilla does the same for him now\u2026 When the queen mother died, the prince really needed that presence. And Camilla, in many ways, stepped into the shoes of the queen mother and became that strong presence and rock in his life. She\u2019s given him the ability to be himself.\u201d\n\nAnd Charles has also welcomed another leading female figure into his circle. His youngest son Harry, 34, married American actress Meghan Markle in May of this year. When the 37-year-old\u2019s father couldn\u2019t walk her down the aisle, Charles immediately stepped in and took his place.\n\nHarry and Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, is expecting her first child. Bullen said Charles his grateful his has someone like the former \u201cSuits\u201d star by his side. Charles is also aware Markle has a crucial new role to play for the family.\n\n\u201cFrom what I know, he is a big fan of Meghan Markle,\u201d said Bullen. \u201c\u2026 He just wants his boys to be happy. He knows those boys have had a rough life with his marriage falling apart in front of the whole world. Then they lost their mother at a very young age\u2026 And Meghan is making Harry very happy. And that makes the Prince of Wales happy.\n\n\"He wants what every father would want for their son\u2026 And he can also see she\u2019s good for the family. She\u2019s great-looking, she\u2019s really clever, she loves Prince Harry, she\u2019s brilliant on stage \u2014 she\u2019s a great asset to the family. She\u2019s part of the monarchy\u2019s future and he knows it.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "John Yoo: Will Mueller Be Satisfied With Written Answers From Trump?

The list is stacked with liberal star power from the hills of Hollywood to the halls of Washington \u2013 as well as some of their activist friends in and out of the media on both coasts.\n\nWhen asked why they planned to vote in the midterm elections, virtually all of the women on the Marie Claire list, standing atop their soapboxes, gave us the canned version of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s talking points with their own personal flavor mixed in.\n\nRemember Chicken Little, who thought the sky was falling? Listen to these women and you\u2019d think the whole world is collapsing \u2013 and it\u2019s all Donald Trump\u2019s fault, aided by evil Republicans in Congress.\n\nMarie Claire\u2019s writers and editors are so entrenched in their little left-wing corner of the world that they likely don\u2019t even realize their view of women is wildly distorted \u2013 like what you see looking in a fun house mirror. Yet these distortions are obvious to any objective observer.\n\nMarie Claire\u2019s sister publication, Vogue, also swallows the true-blue Democratic line. That magazine published a piece on its website Thursday headlined:\" Why Do White Women Keep Voting for the GOP and Against Their Own Interests?\u201d\n\nThe headline illustrates the arrogance, ignorance and condescension of Vogue journalists. They\u2019re assuming they know best what every woman\u2019s personal interests are, based solely on her genetic makeup. #genderprofiling.\n\nBreaking news: Women have brains. And, believe it or not, we don\u2019t all think alike and have the same goals, interests and political beliefs. And we can use our brains to think for ourselves, without waiting for left-wing writers to tell us what politicians to support and what to believe.\n\nSince the Marie Claire journalists are incapable of recognizing that conservative and pro-Trump women can be influential, as a public service I\u2019ve put together a list of such women who should have been on the Marie Claire list.\n\nIt is glaringly obvious that at least some of these women belong on the magazine\u2019s list. One has to wonder how Marie Claire\u2019s list ever got published without them \u2013 except we know. The magazine\u2019s list wasn\u2019t really a list of influencers as much as it was a liberal agenda and a left-wing wish list.\n\nHere are my additions to the Marie Claire list of influential women:\n\nNikki Haley: As U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Haley set herself apart as one of the most effective leaders in the Trump administration, proving she\u2019s not afraid to make the tough calls and refusing to let the U.S. be bullied by other countries. As governor of South Carolina she was praised for bridging the racial divide in the aftermath of the mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston; where nine black church members were killed by a self-proclaimed white supremacist.\n\nKellyanne Conway: If the topic is influential women and politics, no one should leave out Conway, who blew through the glass ceiling by becoming the first woman to successfully run a winning presidential campaign. Unless you accidentally on purpose leave her off the list. Two years after President Trump\u2019s election, Conway still remains one of his most trusted advisers. She\u2019s smart and savvy \u2013 and in a debate you want her on your side.\n\nIvanka Trump: The president\u2019s eldest daughter has held the title of businesswoman, author, entrepreneur and trusted adviser to her father in the White House. Prior to the 2016 election, she was the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization, co-founder of Trump Hotels, founded her own clothing line. She is also the author of the books \"Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success\u201d and \u201cThe Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life.\u201d To say she wields influence is an understatement.\n\nSarah Sanders: The White House press secretary is a trusted adviser to the president and political punching bag for the left. She takes on a hostile media intent on undermining her boss and his administration every day. No matter how many \u201cgotcha\u201d questions they throw at her disguised as journalism, she reminds them who runs the briefing room.\n\nKay Coles James: As the president of the Heritage Foundation, James leads an organization that has provided key people in leadership roles on the Trump transition team in the Trump administration. The foundation has produced scholarship, research and ideas that influence both the administration and Republican members of Congress.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst: The Republican senator is the first woman from Iowa elected to Congress, as well as the first woman combat veteran elected to the Senate. Does anyone else hear the glass breaking above their head? In the Senate she\u2019s fought to improve mental health care for veterans.\n\nMaria Bartiromo: As the host of Fox Business News programs \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d and \u201cMaria Bartiromo's Wall Street\u201d \u2013 as well as \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d on Fox News Channel \u2013 Bartiromo is a straight shooter who is tough and fair, and an outstanding journalist. She\u2019s landed interviews with President Trump, former President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush.\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn: The Tennessee Republican member of the U.S. House was elected Tuesday to the Senate. Remember when the dirty little secret was uncovered on Capitol Hill that your taxpayer money was being used as part of a hush fund to silence sexual assault accusers? Blackburn not only co-sponsored legislation to disclose settlements, but she was one of only a few women who was outspoken in trying to combat the Washington power machine to be transparent. Meanwhile, all of the heralded liberal women senators on Marie Claire\u2019s list have been silent about exposing their predator colleagues. All of them. Hypocrisy, anyone?\n\nPenny Young Nance: Most people don\u2019t know it, but the largest organization centered on women and public policy is not Planned Parenthood, the National Abortion Rights Action League, or some other left-wing feminist group. It\u2019s Concerned Women for America. Nance is the president of the 500,000-member group. CWA will celebrate its 40th anniversary next year \u2013 staying power that transcends most liberal groups.\n\nCandace Owens: As the communications director for Turning Point USA, Owens struck a chord with Americans over the last year with her message of ditching the victim mentality. Whether she\u2019s traveling the media circuit or speaking at college campuses, Owens is encouraging everyone to think for themselves and make decisions based on their experiences.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (honorable mention): While Collins is far from a conservative, the integrity the moderate Republican senator displayed in voting her conscience to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in the face of severe backlash earns her an honorary spot on this list. Her actions are in stark contrast to the reprehensible behavior from her colleagues on the left who made Marie Claire\u2019s list, including Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D- Mass., who were only interested in outright character assassination of the judge and in promoting their expected campaigns for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a parody that has all the makings of a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit back when SNL was actually funny, Marie Claire\u2019s list may entertain you. However, if you want to see some shattered glass fall from the ceiling, you can\u2019t ignore at least some of the women who should have made the list."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Lisa Boothe", "title": "Why Hillary Clinton will never be president - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Why Hillary Clinton will never be president Fox News An op-ed published this week in the Wall Street Journal has ignited rumors of a potential 2020 presidential run for Hillary Clinton.

But none of those versions became president and no matter how many times Clinton tries to reinvent herself she cannot change who she is at the core: inauthentic, unlikable and out of touch.\n\nAccording to the op-ed by Mark Penn and Andrew Stein \u2013 headlined \u201cHillary Will Run Again\u201d \u2013 Hillary Clinton 1.0 was a \u201cuniversal-health-care-promoting progressive firebrand\u201d in 1994 when she was first lady.\n\nHillary Clinton version 2.0 was a moderate when she successfully ran for the Senate and again when she lost in the Democratic presidential primaries to then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nIn 2016, Clinton 3.0 was a progressive who moved further to the left because of her challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. And Hillary Clinton version 4.0 will run for president in 2020 by returning to her roots as a progressive, Penn and Stein predict.\n\nBut the fact there have been so many different versions of Clinton is precisely the problem.\n\nClinton is inauthentic. Former Obama adviser and Democratic strategist David Axelrod nailed this point about Clinton and the 2016 election when he said: \u201cAuthenticity is a big factor and a leading indicator for candidates, and they have to be comfortable in their own skin. There is no one wishing that Donald Trump would speak his mind. Hillary Clinton has always been allergic to revealing herself, and when she does talk, it comes out through a political filter.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s authenticity has also taken a major hit over the years because she changes policy positions depending on where the political winds are blowing. This gives the perception that she is not rooted in any core beliefs.\n\nOne issue that probably hurt Clinton most in the rust belt was trade. As secretary of state in 2012, she backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, even calling it the \u201cgold standard.\u201d However, she changed her position in 2016 while under scrutiny from Bernie Sanders on the left and candidate Trump on the right.\n\nClinton also has a likability problem. In an interview with the Washington Post, Democratic pollster Peter Hart put it this way: \u201cI bring it down to one thing and one thing only, and that is likability.\u201d\n\nThe likability issue was also brought up during a 2008 Democratic primary debate in New Hampshire, when the moderator said voters were impressed by Clinton\u2019s resume but were \u201chesitating on the likability issue.\u201d Obama famously quipped that she was \u201clikable enough\u201d during the exchange.\n\nClinton is also out of touch. Her surprise pit stop to an Ohio Chipotle in 2015 while on the campaign trail demonstrated this. Despite it being a great opportunity for pictures with customers, she wore dark sunglasses in the restaurant. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to speak with anyone.\n\nClinton\u2019s infamous \u201cbasketful of Deplorables\u201d comment also underscores this point. In response to her comment calling his supporters \"racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic,\u201d Trump responded that Clinton showed \"her true contempt for everyday Americans.\"\n\nOther gaffes also speak to Clinton\u2019s disconnect with voters. In response to a question from ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer in 2014 about her $200,000 speaking fees, Clinton said that she and President Bill Clinton \u201ccame out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt.\u201d\n\nPresident Clinton received a $15 million advance for his memoir after leaving the White House and then-Sen. and former first lady Hillary Clinton received $8 million in a deal for her memoir.\n\nIn what will likely be a crowded 2020 Democrat primary field, Hillary Clinton would not stand out. Her time has come and gone. She is a relic of the past. No amount of pollsters, speechwriters, or consultants can change who she is \u2013 and that is why she will never be president."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Benjamin Brown", "title": "Ballet dancer, 23, reported missing; car found abandoned in state park, authorities say - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Ballet dancer, 23, reported missing; car found abandoned in state park, authorities say Fox News A 23-year-old dancer for the St. Louis Ballet was reported missing Tuesday, a day after authorities found her car abandoned in Mark Twain Lake State Park\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/authorities-searching-for-missing-st-louis-dancer-after-abandoned-car-found-in-mark-twain-lake-state-park", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Missing-MO-girl.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T08:59:05Z", "content": "A 23-year-old dancer for the St. Louis Ballet was reported missing Tuesday, a day after authorities found her car abandoned in Mark Twain Lake State Park.

The sun had just risen above the mountain ridge, and winter light filled the ravine where their mud brick house sat at the foot of a slope. \"Let me sleep,\" Abdullah groaned from a mattress on the floor, surrounded by his brothers and sisters.\n\nOne word from his father, though, and the boy was up and dressed, trudging out of the house to the market in a neighboring village. Three hours later, when he still hadn't returned, Mohsanaa and her husband began to worry.\n\nThey were a family trying to get by in Yemen, a nation at war with itself that has become a battleground for more powerful countries.\n\nThey knew that many families like theirs had been caught in the middle, with thousands killed in fighting between Iranian-backed rebels from the north, known as Houthis, and forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the ousted government.\n\nThey knew that al-Qaida militants were based in the mountains, sending fighters out to battle the Houthis, while trying to elude missiles fired from U.S. drones that often killed innocents.\n\nAnd they knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive. He never strayed far \u2014 just to school or to play soccer with his friends in a lot so close his mother could see it from the house. At about 10 a.m., Mohsanaa and her husband called around to the couple dozen other families who lived in their village to ask if anybody had seen Abdullah.\n\nNo one had, and his parents' worry grew to panic.\n\n___\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting\n\n___\n\nAll around al-Said district, in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, people heard the American drone overhead on the morning of Jan. 26.\n\nThat wasn't unusual. The sky often buzzed with drones hunting for the moment to strike at the al-Qaida militants, a mix of locals, foreign fighters and Yemenis from other parts of the country who had moved into the district.\n\nFrom above, the drone surveyed an inhospitable landscape of barren limestone mountains, creased with ravines and gorges. Zooming in on those threads of green, the drone would have scanned dozens of isolated villages like the one where Abdullah lived, each just a few houses above plots of land planted with wheat and animal fodder.\n\nAbdullah's village, Shaab Arshan, sits in a wadi just over 100 meters (yards) wide in places, the bare mountains rearing up steeply on either side. Ravines and gorges lead to slightly larger valleys that eventually open into desert, the fringes of the vast Empty Quarter that takes up much of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nAl-Qaida fighters come down to the valleys to resupply and recruit in the markets. They pass out memory cards with their videos and lectures. They show up at weddings or funerals now and then, preaching to those in attendance. And they offer gifts to teens and young men, the most vulnerable and easily swayed to join their ranks.\n\nFor more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen, trying to eliminate one of the most dangerous branches of the terror network. The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes, carrying out more in two years than the Obama administration did over its entire eight years \u2014 176, compared to 154. More than 300 people \u2014 militants and civilians \u2014 were killed in 2017 and 2018 by one estimate.\n\nAt least 30 civilians were killed in 2018, The Associated Press found, based on accounts from family members and witnesses. A few weeks before Abdullah's disappearance, a drone's missile slammed into a farm in a neighboring province, killing a 70-year-old man and a young relative who had just returned from mediating a land dispute.\n\nBut here in al-Said district, it had been months since the last strike.\n\n___\n\nSoon after he left the house, Abdullah ran into a schoolmate who told him al-Qaida militants were giving away motorcycles in the town of Mosaynaa. The friend had heard it from a neighbor who belonged to the group.\n\nAbdullah had never thought of joining al-Qaida and he didn't want to now. He was in the 8th grade and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day. But he knew how to drive, and he wanted a motorcycle.\n\nThe boys agreed they would go get the motor bikes and come right home.\n\nThey caught a ride to the market in Yashbom, where Abdullah used part of the money his mother had given him to pay for a taxi to Ataq, the provincial capital on the other side of the mountain.\n\nAbdullah loved Ataq \u2014 the closest thing to a city the village boy had seen. His father took him and his siblings there to buy gifts at holiday times and new clothes before the start of school. He always pleaded with his parents to send him to school there as a reward if he made it to the top of his class.\n\nIt was there that his friend had been told to contact the militants who would take them where they needed to go. They had no idea how far away that would be.\n\n___\n\nAbdullah's parents expanded their search to nearby villages and called relatives in Ataq. No one had seen their boy.\n\nWhat if a driver had hit Abdullah and sped away? He could be lying by the side of the road, or maybe someone found him and took him to a hospital.\n\nAbdullah was their miracle child. Mohsanaa had complications in the pregnancy and gave birth to twins after only seven months. Abdullah's brother died within days, and doctors were sure Abdullah would die, too. He was tiny, hairless, and there were no incubators at the hospital.\n\n\"If you saw him, you'd think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand,\" Mohsanaa said.\n\nWhen Mohsanaa brought Abdullah home, she wouldn't let anyone near him. She fed him formula. She kept him warm by spreading butter over his body and wrapping him in cotton. Every day, he got better, and by six months \"he became a normal baby,\" she said.\n\nIn an impoverished country where nearly four years of civil war have pushed millions to the brink of starvation, the family had much to be thankful for. Abdullah's father, Saleh bin Elwiya, worked as a taxi driver and made enough to feed his wife, four sons and four daughters.\n\nSaleh was a careful driver, plying the roads all day as far as Aden, southern Yemen's biggest city, on the coast. He adored his children and had taught all his sons to drive, except for the youngest, Abdel-Salam, who at 8 couldn't reach the pedals yet.\n\nHe always urged Abdullah to focus on his schoolwork.\n\n\"You just study, and I will take care of everything else,\" Saleh told him. \"I don't want you to end up a taxi driver like I did because I didn't finish school.\"\n\nNow his boy had vanished.\n\nSaleh's eldest son, Zayad, and a brother-in-law, Nabil, drove out to search the roads. The two were in the army together, on a week's leave from a front-line unit fighting the Houthi rebels. At every army checkpoint along the way, they described Abdullah to the soldiers, asking if they'd seen him: A tall, lanky boy, baby face, not a trace of whiskers?\n\nFinally, a soldier outside Ataq said yes. He'd seen him passing in a car. It was welcome news: At least they knew Abdullah had made it this far.\n\nSaleh headed for Ataq in his taxi. There, he joined his relatives, searching in the markets and at taxi stands, going street by street, alley by alley through the city. He spoke little, growing more tense with every futile turn.\n\nAs night fell, they gathered at the home of Saleh's brother in the Russian Compound, a housing complex on the city's edge, built in the 1980s when Soviet experts were here searching for oil. Zayad called his mother. Still nothing, he told her.\n\nMohsanaa told him to stay there and wait until morning to resume the search. She didn't want them driving around in the dark.\n\n\"Things happen at night,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nOn the outskirts of Ataq, Abdullah and his friend met a militant, who drove them in a Land Cruiser along a desert highway to Mosaynaa, through an area where Abdullah had never been before. He realized he had been gone for a long time and hadn't told his parents where he was. He thought about turning back but didn't have the nerve to say anything.\n\nThey passed through Mosaynaa, and the car wove up into the mountains to the al-Qaida fighters' camp. In a tent, they all had a meal of chicken and rice and Pepsi, but there were no motorcycles. It was too late to leave, so they would have to stay the night. The militants gave the boys a phone to send a message to their parents, and Abdullah texted his father: \"I am with al-Qaida. I'll come back tomorrow. Don't come for me.\"\n\nThe boys were offered a tent, but decided to sleep in a nearby crevasse, under some trees. They were worried about airstrikes.\n\n___\n\nWhen he received the message in Ataq, Abdullah's father tried calling back to the militant's phone. It was turned off. They had to move right away, Saleh told his relatives, or else \"I won't be able to get him back.\" Once in al-Qaida's hands, Abdullah would be gone forever, sent to fight the Houthis or strapped with a suicide belt \u2014 or he might be hit by a drone.\n\nWith al-Qaida, \"all roads lead to death,\" said one of Saleh's nephews.\n\nDespite his wife's warnings, Saleh got back into the taxi and drove into the night, joined by Zayad and Nabil, along with two of Saleh's nephews who offered to help.\n\nThe search party asked around the shops and eateries still open in the markets. They learned that the boys had been there hours earlier, heading for the mountains.\n\nSaleh had never been to Mosaynaa and didn't have the tribal links needed to find his son. He needed local help, so he went to one of the few families he knew, the al-Tolsi family.\n\nThe al-Tolsi brothers were beekeepers, a common trade in Yemen, a country known for its honey. One of the brothers had links to al-Qaida, but he wasn't there when Saleh and his relatives appeared at the door of the family house. Instead, it was another brother, named Mubarak.\n\nMubarak was not connected to al-Qaida and had status in the community, working as the imam at the local mosque and performing the daily call to prayer. He welcomed the men in and offered them dinner. Over the meal, his guests explained why they had come. Mubarak said he was happy to take them to the mountains in the morning. It was too dark now. But Saleh was insistent.\n\nMubarak gave in. The beekeeper and his nephew, Naguib, a geology student at a local oil university, joined them, setting out at 10 p.m. At the foot of the mountains, they sought out a local man known to be a look-out for al-Qaida. He belonged to the same tribe as Mubarak, so they knew they could ask him to take a message to the militants: There is a man here who wants his son back.\n\nAs the look-out went up the mountain, the seven of them waited below in Saleh's taxi.\n\n___\n\nAt around 11:30 p.m., an operator pressed a button in a U.S. military base \u2014 perhaps in neighboring Saudi Arabia, perhaps as far away as Nevada or Georgia \u2014 launching two Hellfire missiles from a drone cruising above the mountain. Abdullah heard explosions in the valley and, terrified, started to cry.\n\nThe hours passed slowly to daybreak, when Abdullah and his friend made their way down the mountain. Part way down, they saw a mangled car below. At the bottom, Abdullah recognized the license plate: His father's taxi.\n\nThe missiles had reduced the car to burned wreckage. Abdullah's father and brother and the other five people inside were torn to pieces.\n\nThere were no bodies. Overnight, militants had rushed to the site and taken the remains to Mosaynaa, but their blood was everywhere.\n\n\"It was shocking. I wept,\" Abdullah said. \"I realized he had come looking for me.\"\n\n____\n\nNews of the deaths in a drone strike fanned out across the district, passed by WhatsApp messages and phone calls.\n\nOne of Mubarak's brothers, Ahmed al-Tolsi, was away in the neighboring province of Marib, taking their bees to flowers there. He got a message and rushed home to Mosaynaa to bury his kin.\n\n\"He is a generous man who received this family, gave them dinner and told them he would help them bring back their child,\" he said of Mubarak. \"He was doing something good and got killed.\"\n\nIn Ataq, one of Saleh's nephews heard a knock on the door at dawn. \"Your brothers and uncle are in God's embrace,\" a neighbor said.\n\nThe remains of Saleh and his relatives were taken to the town of Yashbom, where Abdullah's odyssey began, and laid out under sheets in the mosque. Saleh's legs were gone; Zayad's body was cut in half.\n\nIn keeping with Muslim custom, the five were buried right away in the Yashbom cemetery.\n\nAbdullah's mother woke at dawn for morning prayers, still worrying about Abdullah. At 7:30 a.m., neighbors arrived dressed in black for mourning and told her the news: Saleh and the others had been hit by the drone. They were all dead.\n\n\"It's not possible. We talked in the evening,\" Mohsanaa said. \"I told them not to go out at night.\"\n\nShe was terrified that Abdullah had been killed as well.\n\nThen Abdullah appeared. He had walked four hours to get home and found the crowd of mourners gathered at his house. He sat alone under a tree nearby, trembling, afraid he would be blamed, until the men went over and reassured him. Mohsanaa had her son sit beside her and placed her hands on his head.\n\nTribal leaders sent emissaries to the al-Qaida fighters to demand they leave the area. But months later, Abdullah still blamed himself, not al-Qaida or the U.S.\n\n\"It was my all mistake,\" Abdullah said. He speaks in short, muddled sentences, stooped over and looking down at his fingers.\n\n\"I was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.\"\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed that it carried out a strike in Shabwa province on Jan. 26, saying it was targeting al-Qaida. It does not release details or death tolls in drone strikes, spokeswoman Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich said.\n\nEver since, the families have tried to prove their slain loved ones were not militants. They gathered letters from everyone they could \u2014 police officers, district officials, tribal leaders, school principals \u2014 certifying that their relatives did not belong to al-Qaida. They spoke to human rights groups and the International Committee of the Red Cross, asking for an investigation.\n\nThey even held a demonstration in Ataq, attended by some 200 people, reading out a statement demanding the U.S. acknowledge that the victims were not al-Qaida and pay compensation to the families.\n\nTheir voices have not been heard. The U.S military has an official mechanism for families to request compensation for relatives mistakenly killed \u2014 a few families in Iraq and Pakistan have succeeded \u2014 but there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen, so there is nowhere for Saleh's family to submit evidence that they were civilians.\n\nAbdullah's family has shards of the missiles that killed the seven men.

With her husband gone, she scrapes by on a meager pension and tries to manage her family's grief. She doesn't speak of the killing in front of Abdullah. A pious woman, she knows he mustn't blame himself.\n\n\"This is God's verdict. If it wasn't written, they wouldn't have gone,\" Mohsanaa said. \"What's the child's guilt? He is a victim.

But the campaign has had a hidden cost: civilians cut down by the drones' missiles.\n\nThere is no comprehensive count of civilian deaths because of the difficulty of confirming identities and allegiances of those killed. But in an examination of drone strikes this year alone, The Associated Press found that at least 30 of the dead likely did not belong to al-Qaida.\n\nThat is around a third of all those killed in drone strikes so far in 2018. The Pentagon does not release its assessment of the death toll, but an independent database considered one of the most credible in tracking violence in Yemen counted 88 people \u2014 militants and non-militants \u2014 killed by drones this year.\n\nThe AP count gives a glimpse, even if incomplete, into how often civilians are mistakenly hit by drone strikes, at a time when the Trump administration has dramatically ramped up the use of armed drones. It has carried out 176 strikes during its nearly two years in office, compared to the 154 strikes during the entire eight years of the Obama administration, according to a count by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\n\nThe AP based its count on interviews with witnesses, families, tribal leaders and activists. Most of those killed, 24, were civilians; at least 6 others were fighters in pro-government forces \u2014 meaning ostensibly on the same side as the U.S. \u2014 who were hit in strikes away from the front lines while engaged in civilian life.\n\n___\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting\n\n___\n\nThe drone toll goes almost unnoticed in the region's conflicts. Immensely greater destruction has been wreaked by U.S. allies in the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign against Iranian-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis. More than 57,000 civilians and combatants have been killed in Yemen's civil war, by some estimates, and thousands more may have died of starvation caused by the conflict.\n\nYet the killing of a single man \u2014 Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, slain by Saudi operatives in his own country's consulate \u2014 has raised more international uproar than any of those deaths in a war waged by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and baked by the U.S.\n\nIn comparison, the toll from U.S drones in Yemen runs in the hundreds, including both militants and civilians. Several databases are trying to track the deaths, with varying results. The Bureau for Investigative Journalism counted up to 1,020 killed by strikes from 2009 to 2016, under President Barack Obama, compared to up to 205 killed in 2017 and 2018. Another database, by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, counted 331 killed the past two years.\n\nCounting civilians among those numbers is complicated by the difficulty in determining who belongs to al-Qaida in a country of multiple warring militias. Al-Qaida has joined the battle against the Houthis, and many of its fighters are incorporated into militias armed and funded by the U.S.-backed coalition.\n\nThe campaign has scored some military successes. In 2015, U.S. strikes took out Nasser al-Wahishi, the top leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the Yemeni branch is known, and several senior lieutenants.\n\nBut drones have been most effective in forcing al-Qaida to limit its movements and hide in the mountains, avoid large gatherings and restrict cellphone use. The group withdrew from areas it controlled in the south but was allowed to keep weapons and money under secret deals it struck with the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member.\n\nOver the years, the cost of the pursuit of senior leadership has been high.\n\nFor example, the U.S. has killed at least 66 civilians, 31 of them children, in the unsuccessful hunt for one man, Qassim al-Rimi, one of AQAP's founders who in 2015 succeeded al-Wahishi as the group's chief.\n\nThose deaths came in two raids reportedly targeting al-Rimi. The first was in 2009 in the southern village of al-Majalah. The second came on Jan 27, 2017, only days after Trump's inauguration, in a U.S. special forces assault on a village in Bayda province.\n\nThe civilian deaths come in a war conducted from a vast distance.\n\nDrone pilots work remotely at American bases, most often in the U.S., sometimes on 11- to 14-hour shifts housed in rooms like shipping containers lined with electronics. They operate based on intelligence from informants but they also carry out so-called \"signature strikes,\" based on observing suspicious patterns of behavior. They have a list of characteristics, and if a subject on the ground shows a number of them, he could be targeted, a former participant to the drone program told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the operations.\n\nMistakes happen from bad intel or misjudging behavior, he said. Rights groups have expressed concern that some of the intelligence may come from prisoners held in jails run by Emirati-backed militias where torture is widespread.\n\nSome of the strikes from 2018 that the AP examined appeared to be mistakes.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a drone missile slammed into a farm in Bayda province where 70-year-old Mohammed Mansar Abu Sarima sat with a younger relative, killing both, according to a relative, Mohammed Abu Sarima.\n\nThe slain men had just returned from mediating a local dispute. In a country where tribal links are powerful and the justice system nearly non-existent, such mediations are common to resolve conflicts over land or deaths. They involve large gatherings of tribesmen who are often armed, potentially raising drone operators' suspicions.\n\n\"We don't have any affiliation. They are simple farmers who don't know how to read or write,\" said the brother. \"We live in fear. Drones don't leave the sky.\"\n\nSeveral weeks later, a 14-year-old shepherd, Yahia al-Hassbi, was struck by a drone as he tended goats several kilometers (miles) from a checkpoint that al-Qaida had tried recently to seize. He was killed along with a construction worker passing by at the time, according to relatives and three local human rights workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nFurther east, in Hadramawt province, drones carried out several consecutive days of strikes in March, targeting vehicles on a main highway. Some of the strikes killed al-Qaida militants, according to rights activists in the area.\n\nBut others struck down cars carrying people who had fled to the area from a nearby province, Jawf, to escape fighting. A drone's missile on March 5 killed a 10-year-old boy, Ammer al-Mahshami, and wounded the driver, according to three relatives. Four days later, another car was hit, killing six men and boys, including a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, travelling to a funeral.\n\nSaleh al-Wahir, the brother of one of the dead, was in a car behind them. \"I saw it before my eyes,\" he said of the blast. \"Bodies were ripped apart.\" A report from the Jawf Human Rights office concluded the men were civilians.\n\nSurvivors are rare. Adel al-Mandhari recounted how his car was thrown through the air by the blast of a drone's missile. He lost his legs and an arm and was burned all over his body. The four others in the car \u2014 his brother, uncle, cousin and another relative \u2014 were all killed. None were connected to al-Qaida, said al-Mandhari, a civil servant. Two other relatives and the three rights workers in Bayda confirmed his account.\n\nSince the attack, al-Mandhari has spoken to the media and rights groups, seeking ways to get compensation and an apology from the U.S. \"I lost hope,\" he said. \"Nothing is going to happen.\"\n\nEven some strikes that the AP did not include in its count may have killed civilians, though there is some dispute over them.\n\nOn May 14, two men, Hussein al-Dayani and Abdullah al-Karbi, were killed when a drone struck their pickup truck in an area of Shabwa province where al-Qaida is known to have a presence.\n\nAl-Dayani's brother, Khaled, denied they were militants. He said his brother was a fighter in a militia battling the Houthis. \"We are against those people,\" Khaled said of al-Qaida.\n\nTwo weeks later, a 17-year-old, Mahdar Hussein al-Hag, died in a strike while driving his motorcycle in the same area. Mahdar's father said he was a high school student and was returning from buying vegetables. \"He might have been mistaken for al-Qaida youth who are active in this area.\"\n\nA Yemeni security official said the dead in those strikes were all al-Qaida members, though he did not provide evidence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Amy Lieu", "title": "Boy, 14, used as human bridge receives apology, support after video goes viral", "description": "About 50 students and adults are rallying outside a high school in Canada on Tuesday and calling for an end to bullying after a teen with cerebral palsy was used as a human bridge to cross a stream earlier this month, reports said.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/rally-calls-for-end-to-bullying-after-canadian-boy-was-taunted-into-acting-as-human-bridge-on-creek", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/boy-human-bridge.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T07:44:25Z", "content": "About 50 students and adults rallied outside a high school in Nova Scotia, Canada, on Tuesday, calling for an end to bullying after a teen with cerebral palsy was used as a human bridge to cross a stream earlier this month, reports said.

They have not been identified.\n\nThe number of homes and other structures destroyed had reached 435 but that number was sure to rise, warned Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Damage assessments were continuing, with crews having to gain access to canyon areas on foot.\n\nSome people who stayed behind in coastal communities that were cut off by road closures got supplies by boat. Gas, food, baby wipes and horse pellets were among the items brought ashore in the Paradise Cove area of Malibu. Some residents donned wetsuits and swam ashore with cases of water and beer.\n\n\"It's pretty cool. It's really amazing that people out there know that we're kind of stranded here in Malibu,\" Cherie Millford Smart said.\n\nIn addition to homes and other buildings, more than 80 percent of National Parks Service land in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area was incinerated.\n\nThe area has not seen such a destructive blaze since 1993. The blaze has left an array of hazards, including trees ready to fall, downed power lines, toxins, water main and gas leaks.\n\nA forecast of possible rain next week would help firefighters but also raised the prospect of potential mud flows, Osby said.\n\nAnother fire that also broke out last Thursday in Ventura County was 92 percent contained after burning nearly 7 square miles (18 square kilometers). The so-called Hill fire destroyed two buildings and damaged two.\n\nA new fire erupted late Tuesday about 75 miles (121 kilometers) to the east in the Fontana area of San Bernardino County but firefighters reported good progress overnight, holding the blaze to 147 acres (59 hectares).\n\nThe cause of the Southern California fires remained under investigation.\n\nDowned power lines and blown transformers have been blamed for several of the deadly fires that have burned in recent years.\n\nA lawsuit was filed Tuesday over a wildfire in Northern California, where at least 48 people were confirmed dead in the Camp Fire that obliterated the town of Paradise. The suit on behalf of some victims accuses Pacific Gas & Electric Co. of causing the massive blaze.\n\nA landowner near where the fire began said PG&E notified her the day before the wildfire that crews needed to come onto her property because some wires were sparking.\n\n___\n\nMyers reported from Thousand Oaks.

Abe will become the first Japanese leader to visit Darwin since the bombing of the northern Australian city by Japanese forces in World War II.\n\nMorrison will then hold meetings with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during the APEC meeting in Port Moresby. Pence will use the northern Australian city of Cairns as his base for those meetings amid concerns over security in Papua New Guinea. It's expected several other APEC leaders will also stay in Cairns.\n\nTrade and investment will be a major focus of Morrison's meetings with Abe, who will use his Darwin trip to also visit Japan's biggest ever foreign investment, the $40 billion Ichthys gas project in which Japanese firm Inpex is the majority shareholder and operator. The project, which pipes offshore gas from the northwest Australian coast to Darwin, began its first shipments of liquefied natural gas to Japan last month.\n\nMorrison said he and Abe would also acknowledge those who served in World War II, in a pointed gesture in the northern port city that was bombed by Japanese forces in 1942, with the loss of 250 lives.\n\n\"Prime Minister Abe's visit is deeply symbolic and significant and it will build on our two countries' strong and enduring friendship as well as our economic, security, community and historical ties,\" Morrison said in a statement.\n\nThe meeting comes at a time when a key topic for Australia, its second-largest trading partner Japan and other Asian and South Pacific neighbors is how to respond to the growing influence of China, Australia's biggest trading partner.\n\nAustralia and Japan are expected to reach agreement in Darwin to facilitate larger and more regular joint military exercises, part of a strengthening of defense and economic ties amid growing uncertainty about American involvement in Asia under the Trump administration.\n\nNegotiations began in 2014 for the Reciprocal Access Agreement, which would make it easier for Japanese and Australian forces to visit either country with equipment for military exercises.\n\nAn official from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Australian Financial Review newspaper this week that the two countries were \"at the final stage in discussions\" on the agreement, set to become the first pact on visiting forces Tokyo has signed outside of its arrangement with the U.S.\n\nJapan is also expected to welcome Australia's new foreign policy shift toward the southwest Pacific announced last week. Canberra will set up a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.4 billion) fund to support infrastructure projects in the region, which fits with Japan's call for alternative sources of investment to China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nMorrison will also meet Pence in Port Moresby, where the vice president is expected to deliver a speech at the APEC CEO Summit on Saturday morning continuing Washington's push against China's growing influence. Pence is due to talk just minutes after an address to the forum by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Morrison will also address the gathering\n\nAs the U.S. trade war with China continues, Pence is expected to maintain a hard line against Beijing, following a speech he delivered last month accusing China of stealing U.S. intellectual property, meddling in American elections and suppressing human rights.\n\nPence is also expected to increase pressure on China over its militarization of the disputed South China Sea, the need to maintain pressure on North Korea to denuclearize and on the fight against terrorism.\n\nPence's press secretary Alyssa Farah said he would \"deliver the message that authoritarianism, aggression, and the disregard for other nations' sovereignty by any nation in the Indo-Pacific will not be tolerated by the United States.\"\n\nThe vice president is also expected to set out Washington's rival vision for the Indo-Pacific, promoting private investment over state-controlled funding to build regional infrastructure, in reaction to Chinese involvement in the South Pacific in recent years.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Washington Post last weekend, Pence wrote: \"The United States will work with like-minded nations \u2014 from India to the Pacific islands \u2014 to advance our shared interests. Together, we will stand up to anyone who threatens our interests and our values. The United States seeks collaboration, not control.\"\n\nAustralia will show off a heavy military presence around the APEC meeting to maintain security including a helicopter-landing ship, fighter jets and 500 troops to be stationed in Port Moresby.\n\nThe U.S., Japan, China, Canada, New Zealand and Indonesia are also contributing to security arrangements."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "William Sanchez", "title": "The FOX News Rundown 11/14/2018", "description": "On Tuesday, Amazon announced the sites of its long anticipated second headquarters.

In 2015, the International Monetary Fund estimated that upgrading the capital for the event and hosting a year of related meetings could cost $1 billion.\n\nAustralia, the biggest foreign aid donor to Papua New Guinea and former colonial occupier, as well as China and other countries have absorbed some of the cost but critics have already been given plenty of vindication.\n\nIn an eye-popping move, the government imported 40 luxury Maserati cars to whisk VIPs among convention venues in the secure bubble of the APEC meetings. Officials said the government would sell them to recover the cost, sparking more disbelief and suspicions of a corrupt scheme.\n\nChinese government money, meanwhile, has built what has been dubbed a boulevard to nowhere in the capital Port Moresby, a city described by the World Bank as among the world's most violent due to high unemployment and brazen criminal gangs known as \"raskols.\"\n\nConstruction of an iconic building \"APEC Haus\" for the leaders' summit was paid for by oil and gas company Oil Search, which operates all of Papua New Guinea's oil fields, in exchange for tax credits. That avoided an immediate cost for the government but will erode its revenue in the future.\n\n\"I think the money should have been used to fix our backyard instead of decorating the front porch.

In the impenetrable language of APEC, the meeting is about \"Harnessing Inclusive Opportunities, Embracing the Digital Future.\"\n\nAllan Bollard, executive director of the APEC secretariat, said the meeting is complicated by the tensions between China and the U.S. over trade and the broader backlash against globalization \u2014 the dominant Western-led ideology over the past four decades that freer trade and movement of people is inevitably good for all.\n\n\"This year we've had more bilateral trade friction, between the U.S. and China in particular, and that does make it more complex around the table in the sense that APEC only does initiatives where everybody agrees,\" Bollard said.\n\nPort Moresby, a city where foreigners and the local elite live in homes barricaded behind high walls and barbed wire, will host more than 12,000 visitors for the meetings that end on Sunday.\n\nBecause of a shortage of hotels, many will stay in three cruise ships docked at Port Moresby and be shuttled back and forth in some of the hundreds of vehicles imported for the event. The city will be crawling with police and military, some of them from Australia and New Zealand, who are providing air force planes, navy patrol boats, special forces and other personnel.\n\nAustralian media reports say Canberra is spending more than $100 million on security and other support for APEC. The Australian prime minister's office declined to release a figure, calling the assistance an \"extension of long-term cooperation.\"\n\n\"The security is going to be so tight,\" said Jonathan Pryke, a Papua New Guinea expert at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. \"This is going to be the safest time to be in Port Moresby.\"\n\nEven so, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage will be flying into the country each day from northern Queensland in Australia.\n\nOutside of the spruced-up capital, 2018 has been a year of renewed tribal and political violence.\n\nEarlier this month, rioting engulfed the coastal town of Alotau more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Port Moresby after police leaving for APEC killed a woman and her child in a road accident, said the town's Catholic Bishop Rolando Santos.

Those people would get a chance to vote at a later date, the Times reported.\n\nOpinion polls indicate Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama is poised to win a second term after he first held democratic elections in 2014, eight years after seizing power in a coup. His main opponent is Sitiveni Rabuka, who led two military coups in the 1980s before serving seven years as prime minister. Just this week, a judge cleared Rabuka of an electoral disclosure violation in a case many viewed as being politically motivated.\n\nFiji has not allowed the political tensions to take a toll on its vital tourism industry, which promotes the Pacific nation's pristine, sunny beaches and friendly, welcoming people. Given the history of coups, political stability has been a big issue leading up to the election, as have racial tensions and economic issues.\n\n\"Bainimarama does look set to secure his second victory at the polls and has already led the country for 13 years through a period of relative stability,\" said Jonathan Pryke, the director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.\n\nMany people in the nation of 920,000 seem appreciative of the economic gains they've made under Bainimarama.\n\n\"There are no school fees. Before, I paid a couple hundred for school fees,\" said Mere Rigamoto, a 42-year-old mother of three boys. \"Bainimarama's government is not bad. He's OK.\"\n\nBut Bainimarama has a troubled political history that has contributed to the coup culture. There are rumors he could stage another coup should he lose the election.\n\n\"We're bound to have another coup if he doesn't win,\" said 30-year-old Robert Lum On, a recent university graduate.\n\nFiji became independent from the U.K. in 1970. In 1987, Rabuka staged two racially charged coups to return the country to the hands of indigenous Fijians, called \"iTaukei,\" and away from Fijians of Indian descent, or Indo-Fijians.\n\niTaukei make up about 57 percent of the country's population, while Indo-Fijians make up 38 percent.\n\nIndo-Fijians have been a major ethnic group in Fiji since colonial times, when the British brought them in to work the sugar cane plantations. Many Indo-Fijians favor Bainimarama, whose new constitution in 2013 removed race quotas from Parliament.\n\n\"Bainimarama's key success has been to establish the name 'Fijian' for all citizens of Fiji,\" said Richard Herr, a professor at Fiji National University who is based in Australia. \"His legislation has made campaigning on race, or even having a racially based party, illegal.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bainimarama accused Rabuka of stoking the flames of racism that continue to divide the nation. But some indigenous Fijians believe Rabuka will help restore their prestige, and favor his promise to bring back the nation's Great Council of Chiefs, which Bainimarama disbanded.\n\nCritics deride Bainimarama as authoritarian, but since forcing himself into power, he has refashioned his image into that of a stable, legitimate leader. His appeal was bolstered when he assumed the U.N. COP23 presidency in November 2017. In that role, which he holds until December, he shaped Fiji into a pioneer on climate change issues.\n\nWith COP23 as a platform, Fiji inserted small island developing states into the international conversation on climate change. The islands are on the front lines of global warming, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji, and Bainimarama reoriented regional alliances toward China. His critics accuse him of selling out the country to the Chinese.\n\nThe Lowy Institute says Fiji received about $360 million in aid from China between 2006 and 2016, putting it behind only Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. China Exim Bank holds 39 percent of Fiji's externally held public debt, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nFiji's relations have since normalized with Australia and New Zealand, but the period of sanctions enabled China to step up its regional influence.\n\nFiji has one of the healthiest economies of the Pacific Islands, and GDP is predicted to grow above 3 percent annually through 2020. Tourism is the bedrock of the economy, accounting for more than 40 percent of GDP.\n\nBainimarama's government takes credit for increasing social services, including free primary and secondary education, free bus fares for seniors, and aid in the aftermath of cyclones. But widespread poverty persists.

Republicans claimed control of the House for the first time in 40 years, capturing a staggering 54 seats. It was the biggest gain of seats for either party since 1948.\n\nAnd everyone thought the outcome spelled doom for President Bill Clinton.\n\nFour years later, House Republicans went on to impeach the president after his affair with Monica Lewinsky. But Democrats losing the House in the 1994 midterms proved to be one of the best things which ever happened to President Clinton. Then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., was politically virulent \u2013 as were many of the House GOP\u2019s policies.\n\nPresident Clinton needed a foil. And he earned one in Gingrich and the upstart House Republicans. Gingrich challenged the President over government spending, sparking three government shutdowns. Gingrich and the strident approach taken by House Republicans polluted the 1996 presidential bid of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. President Clinton easily vanquished Dole and returned for a second term.\n\nIt's possible that losing the House could be the best thing that ever happened to President Trump. His poll numbers are low. He lost badly in the presidential popular vote, failing to hit 50 percent in multiple states. With their new power, Democrats promise exhaustive investigations and inquiries into a host of issues.\n\n\"The business of presidential harassment, which we were deeply engaged in in the late '90s, improved the president\u2019s approval rating and tanked ours,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last week. \"My observation is that it might not be a smart strategy. But it's up to them to decide how to handle that.\"\n\nIf anyone ever needed a foil, it's President Trump. No fool he, the president knows how Republicans transfigured prospective House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., into their archenemy more than a decade ago. Democrats must play their cards very carefully, lest they plunge into the historical trap which Mr. Trump could lay for them.\n\nThe President has already warned of a \"war-like posture\" if House Democrats push too far in their inquiries.\n\n\"They can play that game. But we can play it better,\" the president said Wednesday at this post-election press conference Wednesday.\n\nTrump tweeted that his administration would counter Democratic inquests with probes \"for all of the leaks of Classified Information and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!\"\n\nThis is a challenge for Democrats, who partly won control of the House because of what voters interpreted as Republican fealty to the President. Some of the Democrats\u2019 mandate \u2013 to say nothing of their Constitutional responsibility \u2013 is to conduct appropriate investigations and oversight of the executive branch.\n\nBut there is peril in this approach. House Democrats must withstand the urge to make everything about repudiating the administration and the president. This requires balance. And it\u2019s unclear if Democrats can walk that line.\n\nHow do they investigate \u2013 yet not go too far?\n\nPelosi held considerable sway when she served as Speaker from 2007 to 2011, but some wonder if she can harness restive Democrats with the same mastery of old. The Democratic caucus is different from the one she presided over in days of yore. Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., surfaced in Pelosi's office Tuesday to take part in a protest about climate change. Never mind that it was Pelosi who muscled the so-called \"cap and trade\" climate bill through the House when she was Speaker in 2009. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s maneuver is emblematic of how Pelosi could encounter pressure from some liberals who don\u2019t think she is willing to go to the mat with President Trump \u2013 and moderates who think the left is going too far.\n\nThis requires finesse.\n\n\"I don't think we'll have any scattershot freelancing,\" said Pelosi last week regarding Democratic inquiries. \"When we go down any of these paths, we'll know what we\u2019re doing and we'll do it right.\"\n\nNaturally, what's too much and what's right falls within the eye of the beholder. Republicans are lying in wait, ready to excoriate Democrats for pushing too far. One can bet that Republicans will portray any Democratic scrutiny of the President as a bridge too far.\n\n\"I know what the Democrats want to do. Just investigations and impeachment,\" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox Business Network on Sunday. \"America is too great to be led by such a small vision.\"\n\nPelosi recently sidestepped a question about Democratic endeavors to obtain Trump's tax returns. She's frequently deployed a rhetorical sleight-of-hand, using the word \"oversight\" rather than \"investigations.\"\n\nPresident Trump would love to tangle with the Democrats. Aggressive \"oversight\" by likely House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and probable Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., complete with exchanges with White House officials from the dais may energize the left-wing base. But this is the type of battle where Trump excels. Brass-knuckle street fights are de rigueur for this president. Pelosi is wise to attempt a measured approach once Democrats formally claim the majority in early January.\n\nBut can Democrats keep themselves in check even if they wanted to?\n\nThe president will make it hard.\n\nDemocrats hit the ceiling when Trump sacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions just hours after they won the House. Democrats fired off letters demanding information on the firing, called for Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself on the Russia investigation and demanded action on legislation to inoculate Special Counsel Robert Mueller from interference.\n\nThe Democrats' hunger for investigation and revenge may be too much for them to resist the \u00e0 la carte dishes President Trump serves up on a platter.\n\nStriking the proper balance will likely prove to be Pelosi's biggest challenge if she is to serve as the next Speaker.\n\nSome Democrats say it's time for Pelosi to go and have demanded new leadership at the top of their caucus. Some liberals certainly don't want to hear anything about \"measured responses\" and \"restraint.\" They would rather rip a page out of the House Freedom Caucus playbook and raise Cain.\n\nThat\u2019s why the most compelling case for Pelosi to return as Speaker may be her reputation as someone who has been there before. As Speaker, Pelosi has already tangled with a president of the opposite party. She knows how to take a deliberate approach to investigations and oversight.\n\nPresident Trump will likely explode at even reasonable efforts by House Democrats to probe his administration. The President understands the value of a foil \u2013 in much the same way President Clinton comprehended the significance of Newt Gingrich and GOPers after the 1994 midterms.\n\nThings worked well for Mr. Clinton. If House Democrats aren't careful, they'll stumble into the same trap House Republicans did 24 years ago."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Gregg Re", "title": "Bob Woodward criticizes CNN's Acosta lawsuit, says media's 'emotionally unhinged' about Trump", "description": "Bob Woodward, the Watergate journalist whose recent book \"Fear\" described chaotic infighting at the White House, on Tuesday criticized CNN for filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration\u00a0and charged that too many media figures \"have become emotionally u\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bob-woodward-criticizes-cnns-acosta-lawsuit-says-medias-emotionally-unhinged-about-trump", "urlToImage": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/09/10/694940094001_5833195760001_5833195233001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T01:01:08Z", "content": "Bob Woodward, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate journalist whose recent book, \"Fear,\" described chaotic infighting at the White House, on Tuesday criticized CNN for filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration and charged that too many media figures \"\u2026 [+5096 chars]", "fulltext": "Bob Woodward, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate journalist whose recent book, \"Fear,\" described chaotic infighting at the White House, on Tuesday criticized CNN for filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration and charged that too many media figures \"have become emotionally unhinged.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Global Financial Leadership Conference in Naples, Florida, Woodward said \"the remedy [isn\u2019t suing the administration]. ...

The administration suspended Acosta's \"hard pass,\" which provided expedited access to the White House grounds, after he broke protocol by refusing to surrender his microphone during a press conference last week.\n\nAcosta continued to pepper Trump with a barrage of declarative statements and questions -- at times talking over Trump -- until the president stepped away from the podium, even though reporters are typically afforded just one follow-up.\n\n\u201cIn the news media there has been an emotional reaction to Trump,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cToo many people for Trump or against Trump have become emotionally unhinged about this.\u201d\n\nWoodward added that CNN was taking Trump's \"bait\" by enlisting high-profile lawyer Ted Olson to pursue a federal case. \"This is a negative,\" Woodward said. \"Trump is sitting around saying, \u2018This is great.'\u201d\n\nThat sentiment was echoed in a piece in Rolling Stone on Tuesday by Ryan Bort titled, \"CNN Has Played Right Into Trump's Hands.\"\n\n\"Too many people for Trump or against Trump have become emotionally unhinged.\" \u2014 Journalist Bob Woodward\n\nJUDGE NAP: CNN HAS A GOOD CASE AGAINST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\n\n(Trump fiercely criticized Woodward after his book released earlier this year, saying \"he\u2019s had a lot of credibility problems.\")\n\nCNN's suit alleges that the White House violated Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights by punishing him for the content of his speech without providing notice or any due process, although the White House maintains that Acosta was penalized solely because of his behavior.\n\nNone of CNN's approximately 50 other \"hard pass\" holders has lost White House access, nor have reporters belonging to any other liberal-leaning media outlet -- although Trump has suggested that may change.\n\nAt the testy press conference the day after last week's midterm elections, Acosta continued to shout questions at Trump even after he tried to move on to another reporter, and he refused to hand the microphone to an intern who tried to retrieve it.\n\nThe litigation filed by CNN, which does not fully describe Acosta's actions during the press conference and contains several substantive factual inaccuracies, also asserts that the Secret Service violated the Administrative Procedures Act by taking a final agency action in penalizing Acosta without providing any notice or hearing.\n\nThe suit, in arguing that the White House was lying about its motivations for taking action against Acosta, additionally claims that White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders shared a \"doctored\" clip of the episode on Twitter. In the low-resolution .GIF clip shared by Sanders, Acosta's arm moves slightly faster than it does in higher-quality footage of the press conference, appearing to show him more forcefully striking the intern's arm as she tries to take the microphone from him.\n\nHowever, despite reporting from a wide variety of outlets that Sanders had shared a doctored clip, a Buzzfeed analysis suggested the changes in the video could have resulted inadvertently from the conversion of the footage to the lower-fidelity .GIF format, which is commonly used on Twitter. The format produces fewer frames per second than a higher-quality video source, making scenes appear to move faster.\n\nWhite House officials, including Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, have acknowledged that the video was indeed \"sped up\" during the conversion process, while consistently denying that the clip was purposefully doctored.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Sanders used a bogus justification by claiming that Acosta had \"placed his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as White House intern.\"\n\nIn responding to CNN's suit, Sanders on Tuesday said that Acosta's behavior had \"impeded the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\u201d\n\n\"After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions\u2014each of which the President answered\u2014he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions,\" Sanders said in statement.\n\n\"This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters,\" she continued. \"The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional.

Still, a job in the United States is the prize \u2014 the minimum wage is just a few dollars a day in Mexico, and they can make $15 or $20 in one hour working in Seattle or in farm fields in Washington state or California or the Midwest.\n\nIn Guadalajara, the caravan is 1,400 miles from Tijuana, a city at the border south of San Diego. Members of the caravan voted in Mexico City last week to take the longer, and much safer, route west, instead of the roads to Texas, a much shorter journey that takes them closer to Houston and Florida and other destinations in the Eastern United States.\n\nImmigrants fear cartels and kidnappings in the northern Mexican states.\n\nOnce a slow walk through oppressive heat and humidity in southern Mexico, immigrants have learned to hitch rides to ease the journey. Hundreds wait at toll plazas along highways to jump on trucks heading the right direction. As migrants walk less, first aid tents at shelters are treating fewer blistered and bloody feet.\n\nMexican citizens have pitched in, tossing water and fruit to migrants as they pass through small towns. One bus company in Irapuato offered migrants 50 percent off the three-hour ride to Guadalajara.\n\nJose Machado wants to get to Tennessee, where he lived 14 years before being deported to Guatemala.\n\nWhile in Memphis, he worked on sprinkler and irrigation systems, he said. He has two children, ages 14 and 3, that he misses.\n\nHe started walking Oct. 20. After being deported for what he said was a minor traffic infraction, he bought a farm but was harassed by the local gang. He said he could not go to the police because they were on the take. He will seek asylum in the U.S.\n\nHe carries a backpack with only the essentials \u2014 birth certificate, blanket, mattress pad, cellphone, toilet paper, flip flops and cologne.\n\n\u201cI still try to get a lady,\u201d he said Monday, smiling.\n\nMIGRANT CARAVANS SWELL TO 12,000, GET SOME HELP ALONG THE WAY\n\nMigrants are generally aware they\u2019ve become part of the political debate in the U.S., but don\u2019t consume much U.S. media.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said the caravan includes criminals, something the migrants themselves say is true. The U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security said November 1 that 270 people in the caravan have criminal histories.\n\nThe Mexican ambassador to the U.S., Geronimo Gutierrez, told National Public Radio last month some of the migrants have been \u201cvery violent to authority\u201d after they broke through a gate and clashed with police at the border between Guatemala and Mexico.\n\nBut those in the caravan insist they are mostly economic refugees who wish to enter the U.S. legally through the asylum process.\n\n\u201cOur plan is to keep with the caravan, go to the U.S. and have a better life,\u201d said Jorge Gomez, a 14-year-old from Guatemala who is traveling with his father and dreams of going to college and becoming an engineer. \u201cI want the chance to have a good family and be welcomed.\u201d"}]
