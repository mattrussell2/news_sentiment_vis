While he called Congress \"an instrumental partner,\" he also demanded equal treatment for the people of Puerto Rico, who are U.S. citizens.\n\n\"Significant emergency response work remains to be done on the island,\" he wrote in the letter dated Monday. \"Time is of the essence, and continued action by Congress now is critical.\"\n\nRossello said the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency is no longer fully funding things such as temporary generators, the demolition of buildings and tree removal. He said this is a major concern because \"numerous\" critical facilities still rely on generators, millions of cubic yards of debris still have to be cleared and more than 15,000 properties have to be cleaned or demolished.\n\nHe said his administration appealed FEMA's decision to withdraw funds while the island struggles to restructure a portion of its more than $70 billion public debt amid a 12-year recession.\n\n\"The current fiscal situation...means that the withdrawal of full federal support for recovery efforts will significantly hinder the ability of Puerto Ricans to rebuild their homes, businesses, and infrastructure,\" Rossello wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for FEMA did not immediately return a request for comment, nor did the office for U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who was among the letter's recipients.\n\nRossello also requested additional disaster appropriation of $600 million for a federal food assistance program that serves more than 1 million people on the island of 3.3 million inhabitants. He said that previous receipt of additional funding from Congress is helping almost 153,000 other Puerto Ricans participating in the program, but the money is expected to run out early next year.\n\nThe governor also is seeking two more years of Medicaid funding for a total of $3.18 billion, noting that additional funds previously approved for coverage will also dry up in 2019. In addition, Rossello requested a 25 percent tax credit for certain investments related to tourism projects in the next five years.\n\n\"Congress must not delay action on Puerto Rico's requests,\" he wrote.\n\nThe letter was released on the same day that a federal judge overseeing a bankruptcy-like process for Puerto Rico agencies approved a key disclosure statement that is part of a tentative deal reached with certain creditors.

But this training couldn\u2019t prepare me for the recent terrifying sight of my 13-year-old son swelling up, turning red and vomiting from an exposure to nuts he didn\u2019t realize were in his food.\n\nI overcame my paralyzing fear to get him to the hospital emergency room quickly. I will never forget how rapidly his condition deteriorated and then happily reversed in response to an injection of epinephrine \u2013 a powerful hormone also known as adrenaline that is used to treat severe allergic reactions. The hormone was administered with an EpiPen auto-injector in the emergency room.\n\nFood allergies are among the most dangerous allergies, and in the worst cases can be fatal. Peanut allergies are particularly hazardous. As a society, we must learn not only how to recognize and treat them, but also how to prevent them.\n\nUnfortunately, peanut allergies are all too common. An estimated 1 out of 50 children 1 out of 200 adults in the U.S. are allergic to peanuts.\n\nAlarmingly, peanut allergies tripled from 1997 to 2008.\n\nIt is difficult to know for certain that the food you eat is free of nuts. As with my son, the reaction can be swift and life-threatening. In fact, a large percentage of the deaths from food allergies have been due to peanuts.\n\nA study published in Perspectives in Public Health in 2016 put it best: \u201cEvidence suggests a combination of strategies, including natural childbirth, breast feeding, increased social exposure through sport, other outdoor activities, less time spent indoors, diet and appropriate antibiotic use, may help restore the microbiome and perhaps reduce risks of allergic disease. Preventive efforts must focus on early life.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the lack of exposure to early infections, known as the hygiene hypothesis, that can cause allergies. Allergies are caused by a multitude of factors that remove us from the natural order of things.\n\nMy son had a series of ear infections as an infant, and I believe it was perpetual use of antibiotics that changed his microbiome and altered his immune response, leading to his serious nut allergies.\n\nThe microbiome is the vast army of microorganisms \u2013 trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi \u2013 that live in every part of our bodies. When our microbiomes are disrupted \u2013 including by antibiotics \u2013 our health can sometimes suffer.\n\nAnd contrary to the common belief that these microorganisms are always invading germs that are harmful to us, in reality some of these tiny living things inhabiting our bodies are essential to our health.\n\nUnderstanding the complex microbiome in all of us is vital to understand how we can help the many people, including my son, who suffer from peanut allergies.\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nSeveral previous studies have provided hope that a mixture of probiotics and small amounts of peanuts given over time can dramatically decrease the severity of a peanut allergy.\n\nThe theory is that a slow careful introduction of the offending antigen (the substance causing an allergic reaction) leads to gradual accommodation and diminished response.\n\nNow along comes the final proof \u2013 the gold standard \u2013 a multicenter double-blinded randomized placebo trial \u2013 published this week in the esteemed New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThis study was sponsored by Aimmune Therapeutics, the company that makes the drug AR101, yet represents independent thinking and careful observation. A total of 372 children were studied for six months and received the drug (tiny increments of peanut protein) and another 124 received a placebo.\n\nDramatically, two-thirds of the children who received the treatment were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts (600 mg). In contrast, only four from the placebo group could tolerate peanuts at the study\u2019s conclusion.\n\nKeep in mind the goal here was to avoid an allergic reaction from accidental exposure, not to be able to chomp a bag of peanuts at a ballgame, and the peanut extract drug accomplished that in a large majority of patients studied.\n\nWhat was the downside?\n\nThe study found that 14 percent of patients receiving the study drug required epinephrine, versus 6 percent with a placebo. This means that the drug is not something you could take by yourself at home, but a treatment that would require careful observation.\n\nStill, this is clearly a highly successful clinical trial, and I predict that the drug will be approved by the Food and Drug Administration and reach the market (with restrictions) soon.\n\nAR101 and other drugs like it will save lives and improve quality of life \u2013 the goal of parents, children and physicians everywhere.\n\nI also believe AR101 should probably be coupled with probiotics, to replenish the \u201cgood\u201d bacteria that my son and others lost along the way to a deranged immune response, otherwise known as an allergy.\n\nThe day is coming soon when a simple drug will be able re-expose our allergic children to some of the essential proteins or microorganisms we did too good a job protecting them from."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Samuel Chamberlain", "title": "NJ to allocate $2.1M in aid for illegal immigrants facing deportation, governor says", "description": "New Jersey Gov.

He was arrested last week and arrived in the U.S. on Saturday, U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald said.\n\nProsecutors allege in court documents that Vorotinov took out the life insurance policy in spring 2010 and designated his then-wife, Irina Vorotinov, as the primary beneficiary. The couple divorced later that year.\n\nThe scheme began to unfold in 2011, when police in Moldova were notified about a body at the entrance of the Cojusna village, in central Moldova. Documents with the body included Vorotinov's passport and hotel cards.\n\nProsecutors say Irina Vorotinov traveled to Moldova and identified the body as her ex-husband's. She then returned to the U.S. with a death certificate and cremated remains, and collected more than $2 million on his life insurance policy. Prosecutors say money ultimately was transferred to the couple's son and to accounts in Switzerland and Moldova.\n\nAccording to court documents, the FBI started investigating after an agent in Minnesota got a tip in June 2013 from an unknown person in Moldova who said Vorotinov had staged his own death. Later that year, his son, Alkon Vorotinov, was returning from a trip to Moldova when he was stopped by Customs and Border Protection in Detroit. His computer contained digital photographs of his father that were taken that year, showing he was alive.\n\nThe scheme also included a 2011 funeral service at a Minneapolis cemetery, where the urn was placed in a niche. As part of the investigation, the ashes were removed from the cemetery in 2015, tested and determined not to be Vorotinov's.\n\nIrina Vorotinov, 51, has pleaded guilty to two counts for her role in the plot and is serving a three-year prison sentence.\n\nAlkon Vorotinov, 28, pleaded guilty to one count and was sentenced to probation. At the time of his sentencing, his attorney said he came to the scheme late and believed his father was dead for more than a year. The Star Tribune reported that after initially telling authorities his father was the victim of a kidnap-for-ransom plot, he agreed to cooperate and said his father had been living in Moldova and Ukraine under another name.\n\nTogether, Irina and Alkon Vorotinov must repay more than $2 million to the insurance company.\n\nA preliminary hearing for Igor Vorotinov is scheduled for next week. His attorney, Hillary Parsons, did not immediately return a Tuesday message seeking comment.\n\n__\n\nFollow Amy Forliti on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/amyforliti"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "President Trump submits answers to Mueller's questions", "description": "What's next for the Mueller Probe?

The lawyers have them,\" Trump said. \"The written answers to the witch hunt that's been going on forever. No collusion, no nothing. They've been finished. Finished them yesterday. The lawyers have them. I assume they'll turn them in today or soon.\u201d\n\nSpeaking exclusively to \"Fox News Sunday\" this weekend, Trump told host Chris Wallace that he had personally dictated his responses to his team, who was \"writing what I tell them to write.\"\n\nTrump emphasized, however, that he probably would not sit for an in-person interview with Mueller, amid fears voiced by his attorneys that the could be tricked into a so-called \"perjury trap\" in which, even if the president is honest, his version of events differs from other witness accounts enough to trigger a criminal prosecution.\n\nWATCH: TRUMP SPEAKS ON NEW ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL WHITAKER, RUSSIA PROBE IN WIDE-RANGING FOX INTERVIEW\n\n\"We\u2019ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is, probably, that we\u2019re finished,\" Trump said.\n\n'We\u2019ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is, probably, that we\u2019re finished.\" \u2014 President Trump\n\nHe continued: \"We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn\u2019t have even been asked, and I think that should solve the problem. I hope it solves the problem, if it doesn\u2019t, you know, I\u2019ll be told and we\u2019ll make a decision at that time. But probably this is the end.\"\n\nEarlier this year, some of Mueller's questions for Trump at the time leaked to the media and were obtained by Fox News. In one question, Mueller asks what Trump knew about campaign staff, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, reaching out to Moscow. Manafort has since been convicted on unrelated tax and bank fraud charges.\n\nThe questions also covered Trump's motivations for firing former FBI Director James Comey a year ago, as well as his reaction to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal from overseeing the Russia investigation.\n\nThey also inquired into Trump's handling of former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, who lied to federal authorities probing his contacts with Russia concerning sanctions during the presidential transistion period.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, Trump defended Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker against Democrats' calls that he should recuse himself because he has written critically of Mueller's probe, which he said in 2017 was at risk of becoming a \"political fishing expedition.\"\n\nEMERGENCY LEFT-WING PROTEST AGAINST SESSIONS' FIRING HEADS THROUGH NYC -- HIGH ON EMOTION, IRONY\n\nTrump added that he \"would not get involved\" in Whitaker's decisions as he oversees Mueller's probe in his new role as head of the Justice Department. The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion affirming the constitutionality of Whitaker's temporary appointment without Senate approval.\n\n\"Look he -- it\u2019s going to be up to him,\" Trump said. \"I think he\u2019s very well aware politically. I think he\u2019s astute politically. He\u2019s a very smart person. A very respected person. He\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right. I really believe he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right.\"\n\nThe president announced on Friday in the Oval Office that he had completed his written responses and was looking over them before sending them in.\n\n\u201cI was asked a series of questions. I've answered them very easily,\u201d Trump said, adding one has to \u201calways be careful when you answer questions with people that probably have bad intentions.\u201d\n\nFox News' John Roberts contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Broward sheriff's captain who allegedly told responders to 'stage' instead of enter Parkland school resigns - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Broward sheriff's captain who allegedly told responders to 'stage' instead of enter Parkland school resigns Fox News The Broward County sheriff's captain who allegedly ordered first responders to \"stage\" outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas on Feb. 14 \u2014 \u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/broward-sheriffs-captain-who-allegedly-told-responders-to-stage-instead-of-enter-parkland-school-resigns", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/jan_jordan_split.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:48:58Z", "content": "The Broward County sheriff's captain who allegedly ordered first responders to \"stage\" outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas on Feb. 14 \u2014 rather than rush into the building \u2014 has resigned.

It found that such travel \"presents a reputation risk to the organization, especially [given] that UNEP is supposed to be the lead on sustainable environment matters.\u201d\n\nIt also reportedly found that he had \u201cno regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules\u201d and claimed unjustified expenses. The audit reportedly said Solheim did not provide justification for 76 days spent in Oslo and Paris on travel, and he was criticized for allowing two managers to work unofficially from Paris, rather than UNEP headquarters in Nairobi.\n\nSolheim told the outlet that he had paid back money and made changes where rules had been broken.\n\n\u201cIf administrative rules are found to have been overlooked, I accept personal responsibility and offer my unflinching commitment to refining a process that prevents them from ever occurring again,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement Tuesday that he was grateful for Solheim\u2019s service \u201cand recognizes that he has been a leading voice in drawing the world\u2019s attention to critical environmental challenges, including plastics pollution and circularity; climate action; the rights of environmental defenders; biodiversity; and environmental security.\u201d\n\nGuterres said that Deputy Executive Director Joyce Msuya will be acting director while a recruitment process is launched for a successor -- a process that will include discussions with member states.\n\nHALEY: NO TO UN GLOBAL PACT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe United Nations has been a central arena in the international fight over environmental regulations for years, where there has been significant pushback from the U.S. In May the U.S. rejected supporting a proposal for bringing international environmental law under one legally binding treaty at the U.N. The Global Pact for the Environment would consolidate what it called the \"fragmented nature of environmental law\" and \"codify\" it.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said that, \u201cWhen international bodies attempt to force America into vague environmental commitments, it\u2019s a sure sign that American citizens and businesses will get stuck paying a large bill without getting large benefits.

In part because it's undeclared, it's never been debated in Congress by the people's elected representatives whose job it is to do that. I think the Khahoggi murder is disturbing in and of itself.

Jerry Brown proposed similar changes to the state's logging rules that would allow large landowners to topple larger trees and build temporary roads as a way to thin the forests across the Golden State and possibly prevent some widespread wildfires.\n\nUnder Brown\u2019s proposal \u2013 which was supported by the logging industry in the state but opposed by more than a dozen environmental groups - landowners would be permitted to cut trees up to 36 inches in diameter, a jump from the current 26 inches, on properties that are 300 acres or less without getting a timber harvest permit and would also be able to build roads up to 600 feet long.\n\nTimber industry officials supported Brown\u2019s proposal and argued that cutting red tape and allowing landowners to cut down their own trees would not only save money but provide incentives to thin large pine and fir forests that have become hazardously overgrown.\n\nWhile environmental groups agree that a certain level of forest thinning is needed to prevent or lessen the risk of wildfires, they worry that Brown\u2019s plan would permit loggers to cut large redwoods and other vulnerable trees that are not under threat from the wildfires.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge there is a problem,\u201d Kim Delfino, California program director for Defenders of Wildlife, an environmental group, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel back in August. \u201cThe idea of trying to get a handle on it is a good thing.

You don\u2019t need to be putting such large trees on the chopping block.\u201d\n\nTrump over the last week has been slammed for calling California\u2019s forest management a \"big problem\" and suggesting that California officials needed to do a much better job, while downplaying any larger effect from climate change in promoting abnormally dry conditions and dead trees and creating fuel for fire.\n\n\"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\u201d Trump tweeted earlier this month. \u201cBillions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.\"\n\nBrown, who frequently has been at odds with the president over a number of issues, rebuked Trump\u2019s criticism of the state and the president\u2019s focus on forest management over climate change. Brown's spokesman, Evan Westrup, said in a statement that the governor\u2019s \u201cfocus is on the Californians impacted by these fires\u2026not on the president's inane, uninformed tweets.\"\n\nSpeaking on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, Brown added that the he did not press Trump on the argument that climate change is a crucial factor in the rise of more destructive wildfires when the president visited the state over the weekend, but did say that long-term forest health will require reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\"You can mull the science, but I'll tell you every year it's going to get clearer and clearer,\" Brown said. \"I think in less than five years even the worst skeptics are going to be believers.\"\n\nExperts say that the argument over whether the rise in wildfires is caused by a changing climate is not a clear-cut issue, but agree that forest management is not the main contributor.\n\nNature provides the dangerous winds that have whipped the fires, and human-caused climate change over the long haul is killing and drying the shrubs and trees that provide the fuel. That's not to say California is blameless: Urban development encroaching on wildlands also is a factor.\n\nBut about 19 million or 57 percent of California's 33 million acres of forests are managed or owned by the federal government, according to the University of California.\n\nThe wildfire that incinerated the Northern California town of Paradise and surrounding areas is the single deadliest such blaze in California history.\n\nThe other major fire, in Southern California, has burned through shrubland, not forest.\n\n\"It's not about forest management,\" said University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison. \"These aren't forests.\"\n\nThe dean of the University of Michigan's environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \"is much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Matthew Pascarella", "title": "Dr. Marc Siegel: Vaccines Shouldn\u2019t Be Mandated, But Pressuring Parents Is Necessary", "description": "A North Carolina chickenpox outbreak is being blamed on a so-called anti-vaccination community!

That second figure could come down if Google receives credit for the extensive \"environmental remediation\" required for the lots, city officials said.\n\nAny specific figures for a community benefits agreement would be premised on City Council actions that could enhance the properties' value and that could only be determined when specific details of design and square footage are known \u2014 which is a couple of years away, city officials said.\n\nTwo nonprofits, Working Partnerships USA and the First Amendment Coalition, filed a lawsuit against the city over what they claim were illegal nondisclosure agreements signed by officials in the lead-up to the memorandum being released. However, San Jose disputed the allegations in the lawsuit and told Fox News that over 20 public meetings have been held so far and that significant community outreach has been done.\n\nThis fall, Working Partnerships USA and several local activist groups called on Google to provide a substantial amount of benefits in any agreement for its new mega-campus.\n\nThere are legitimate concerns among all the stakeholders, including Google, about issues tied to tech gentrification, such as housing, homelessness and wage inequality.\n\nThe memo states that \"[San Jose] and Google acknowledge that development of the Diridon Station Area may contribute to rising housing costs, potential business and residential displacement, and other impacts on people and place,\" adding that the parties will \"develop approaches to equitable development that are effective, replicable, and leverage resources of the City, Google and other partners.\"\n\nCity Council members have said that they want 25 percent aggregate of the housing built in neighborhoods around Diridon Station to be affordable, and they want to see long-term rent restrictions put into place.\n\n\"A 25 percent affordable housing requirement is a major step in the right direction toward making sure no one from our community is left out,\" Councilmember Sylvia Arenas said in a statement. \"San Jose families need good-paying jobs and housing that is affordable. As a city, we must balance growth while protecting our community.\"\n\nFACEBOOK WRONGLY DELETED ITS PAGE, RUSSIAN GROUP CLAIMS IN LAWSUIT\n\nWhen Google was planning to expand in Mountain View, it offered community benefits that amounted to $100 per square foot of development. San Jose officials told Fox News that that figure likely included direct community benefits and impact fees (for infrastructure and affordable housing) that were required for all developers in that area of Mountain View, California. If a similar formula were applied to the San Jose campus, which will likely be much larger, the total amount of benefits would be far higher.\n\nIn its statement to Fox News, the mayor's office also noted that the community benefits negotiation \"will precede any decision that the Council makes regarding land use designations, zoning, or changes in development height limits.\" Also, given the existing designation of the sites as only for industrial purposes, the Council would have to approve any changes to make way for commercial, retail or residential development.\n\n\u201cWe need to change the narrative about the relationship between cities and tech,\u201d Liccardo said. \u201cTech companies should be viewed neither as our saviors nor our supplicants.

The main caravan has between 4,000 and 6,000 participants, so those arrested represent less than 1 percent of the total.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has made a point of saying the city is not comfortable with the caravan that began arriving last week, and he compared the Central American group unfavorably with about 3,000 Haitians who ended up in this city bordering San Diego on a failed bid to reach the United States last year.\n\n\"The Haitians arrived with their papers, with a clear vision,\" Gastelum said in an interview posted on the city's Facebook page. They came \"in an orderly way, they never asked us for food or shelter,\" renting apartments and making their own food. He said the Haitians found jobs and \"inserted themselves in the city's economy\" and had not been involved in any disturbances.\n\nThe Mexican government gave the Haitians temporary transit permits, and after they failed in attempts to enter the United States, many have since applied for Mexican residency. The majority in the Central American caravan have refused Mexico's repeated offers of residency or asylum, and vowed to cross the border.\n\nThe caravan of Central Americans, he said \"had arrived all of sudden, with a lot of people \u2014 not all ... but a lot \u2014 were aggressive and cocky.\"\n\nTrump administration officials, who have portrayed the migrant caravans as a threat to the United States, have said there were as many as 500 criminals in the groups heading northward, but they haven't said what the crimes were and said they could not reveal the source of the number because they were protecting intelligence sources.\n\nSome local police and residents have expressed concern that portraying the caravan as criminals has tarred its innocent members and exposed them to reprisals.\n\nSome of the largely Honduran migrant were frightened over the weekend when about 500 people in an affluent district of Tijuana staged angry protests against the caravan. Dozens of the more radical protesters then marched to an outdoor sports complex near downtown where 2,500 migrants are staying, sleeping on dirt fields and under bleachers.\n\nDulce Alvarado, 28, from Lempira, Honduras, said she was stepping out of a corner grocery near the complex carrying her 2-year-old son when she was surrounded by the demonstrators chanting \"Get out!\" and \"We don't want you here!\"\n\n\"I was very scared,\" Alvarado said.\n\nA Tijuana police officer helped Alvarado to safety and the protest eventually ended peacefully.\n\nAnother Tijuana police officer, Victor Coronel, who has overseen security outside the sports complex where the migrants are staying, said local fears are based on the bad behavior of only a handful of migrants.\n\n\"The problem is that there has been bad information circulating on social media, with videos of two or three migrants acting badly, climbing the wall or grabbing food in stores,\" said Coronel, adding that most are poor people simply trying to find work.\n\nMexico's ambassador to the U.S., Geronimo Gutierrez, told reporters Monday that the situation is a \"wake-up call\" for the U.S., Mexico and Central America, and could force the region to work together to address the issue of immigration.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego, and there was already a waiting list of 3,000 when the new migrants arrived, so most will have to wait months to even be considered for asylum.\n\nGastelum, appealing for greater federal help to copy with what he called an \"avalanche\" of migrants, estimated they would be in Tijuana for at least six months while waiting to file asylum claims.\n\nFor most people in this city of 1.6 million, the arrival of thousands of Central Americans is not noticeable. Most of the migrants stay within a three-block radius of the sports complex that faces the towering metal walls topped with barbed wire at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBut the United States has dramatically increased security at ports of entry in preparation for the caravan, placing cement barriers topped with razor wire that can be quickly moved to block passage if a mass of migrants to try to force their way into the country.\n\n___\n\nMark Stevenson reported from Mexico City.

President Donald Trump's decision last August to send in additional U.S. forces has had little if any impact on the ground.\n\nThe Taliban carry out near-daily attacks targeting security forces and government officials across the country, while the IS affiliate has bombed gatherings of minority Shiites, killing hundreds of civilians."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Brian Flood", "title": "Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg under pressure amid calls to resign as chairman", "description": "Facebook honcho Mark Zuckerberg is facing increased pressure to defend himself at an international misinformation hearing as one of America\u2019s premiere media critics called for him to step aside as chairman, citing a \u201cserious crisis\u201d at the tech giant.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/facebook-s-mark-zuckerberg-under-pressure-amid-calls-to-resign-as-chairman", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages_Zuckerberg.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:33:28Z", "content": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is facing increased pressure to defend himself as one of America\u2019s premier media critics called for him to step aside as chairman of the board, citing a \u201cserious crisis\u201d at the tech giant.

Canada, the UK, Australia, Argentina and Ireland, Brazil, Latvia and Singapore reportedly want Zuckerberg to discuss fake news and disinformation.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond when asked whether Zuckerberg would attend the hearing or comment on Sullivan\u2019s column.\n\nAt the same time, things aren\u2019t exactly peachy back home for the embattled Zuckerberg, either.\n\nSullivan \u2014 who was previously the public editor of the New York Times \u2014 wrote that the Facebook founder blame-shifts, hides, denies and speaks \u201cin the worst kind of fuzzy corporate clich\u00e9s\u201d when he\u2019s faced with business disasters. She then pointed to \u201ctwo stunning pieces of journalism (that) show the scope of the problem, and how out of his depth\u201d Zuckerberg truly is.\n\nThe first, she said, came when The New York Times published a 6,100-word report last week detailing the company's attempts over a two-year period to deny, delay or deflect blame over Russia's election manipulation on Facebook. The Times claimed that COO Sheryl Sandberg worked in secret to prevent Facebook's board and the public from learning the full extent of Russia's misinformation campaign.\n\nThe bombshell investigation detailed Facebook\u2019s use of a shady opposition-research company. Both Zuckerberg and Sandberg have publicly denied knowing that Definers Public Affairs was working for their company, although Sandberg told employees last week she takes \"full responsibility\" for decisions made by the communications team.\n\n\u201cTo put it more bluntly, Facebook enabled a smear campaign against its critics,\u201d Sullivan wrote.\n\nZuckerberg reportedly told Sandberg that he blamed her and her teams for the public fallout over Cambridge Analytica, the research firm that inappropriately accessed the private data of 87 million Facebook users and used it for political purposes.\n\nFACEBOOK COO UNDER FIRE AS EMPLOYEE MORALE SUFFERS FOLLOWING TIMES REPORT\n\nThe second story Sullivan cited was a feature by Post reporter Eli Saslow that examined a blogger who spreads false information for a living.\n\n\u201cTogether, these stories tell us once again what we already knew: That Facebook is a rudderless ship sailing toward the apocalypse \u2014 and we\u2019re all along for the ride,\u201d Sullivan wrote.\n\n\"Facebook is a rudderless ship sailing toward the apocalypse \u2014 and we\u2019re all along for the ride.\" \u2014 Margaret Sullivan\n\nThe veteran media critic said that if Zuckerberg sticks around \u2014 despite investors calling for his job \u2014 then he should at least \u201cstep down as chairman and appoint an independent director to oversee the board.\u201d Sullivan called Zuckerberg\u2019s recent actions \u201cappalling\u201d and said he \u201cseems to be reaching new lows.\u201d\n\nIf Sullivan\u2019s takedown wasn\u2019t bad enough for the embattled executive, esteemed New York University professor Scott Galloway tweeted a detailed theory that Sandberg has only kept her job because of gender.\n\n\"Every day, senior execs fired for a fraction of the infractions committed by The Zuck and Sheryl Sandberg.\" \u2014 Scott Galloway\n\n\u201cThe only reason Sheryl Sandberg has not been fired is because The Zuck can't be (fired). Nobody wants to be the board who \"fires the woman\" when her boss should bare (sic) responsibility\u2026 but doesn't as he's immune via 2 class stock,\u201d Galloway wrote. \u201cEvery day, senior execs fired for a fraction of the infractions committed by The Zuck and Sheryl Sandberg.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook is facing a host of challenges, including pushback from Democratic and Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill, stagnant or declining user growth in North America and Europe and a plunging stock price. Also, a survey shows that 52 percent of its employees said they were optimistic about Facebook's future, a drop of 32 points from a year ago, while 53 percent said Facebook is making the world better, a 19 point drop from last year.\n\nSullivan ended her scornful column by declaring, \u201cFacebook, whether it wants to admit it or not, is in serious crisis. And its power is such that the crisis extends to everyone it touches \u2014 and beyond.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Christopher Carbone contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Chris Ciaccia", "title": "Rescued squirrel becomes part of woman's family, stashes nuts in her hair: 'He's so funny'", "description": "An English woman saved an injured squirrel she found on the road after apparently being hit by a moving vehicle.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/rescued-squirrel-becomes-part-of-womans-family-stashes-nuts-in-her-hair-hes-so-funny", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/squirrel-in-hair-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:25:25Z", "content": "This story is well \u2014 nutty.

Prosecutors accused them of working with a Sicily-based shipping company to mix medical and \"contaminated\" waste, like migrants' clothing, with other garbage to save money.\n\nProsecutors ordered the sequester of the Aquarius, which is currently moored in Marseille, France, as well as the seizure of 460,000 euros ($526,000), which prosecutors said was the amount saved by the group by not properly disposing of the material.\n\nDoctors Without Borders called the decision \"disproportionate\" and another attempt to criminalize migrant rescues. The group, known by its French acronym MSF, said its waste disposal followed all approved \"standard procedures.\"\n\n\"We are ready to clarify the facts and respond about the procedures we followed, but we strongly reaffirm the legitimacy and the legality of our humanitarian activities,\" said MSF Italia's director general, Gabriele Eminente.\n\nThe Aquarius, a 77-meter (252.62-foot) -long former fishery protection vessel, is perhaps best known for having become a pawn in the European battle over migration in June after Italy's new populist government refused to let it dock in an Italian port. Along with ships of other aid groups, it had rescued thousands of migrants setting off aboard smugglers' boats from Libya and brought them to Italian ports for processing.\n\nAfter a weeklong standoff at sea that returned the migration debate to the world stage, Spain agreed to let the Aquarius dock with its 630 migrants.\n\nItaly's crackdown on migration started well before then, however. The same Sicily prosecutors' office made headlines in 2017 when it publicly accused rescue groups of aiding illegal migration by being in contact with Libyan-based human traffickers as they plucked migrants from the sea off Libya's coast. To date, the investigation hasn't produced any indictments.\n\nIn the new probe, dubbed \"Operation Borderless,\" prosecutors alleged that between Jan. 1, 2017, and May 2018, MSF and the Sicily-based Mediterranean Shipping Agency knowingly avoided the \"rigid treatment\" required for \"dangerous waste,\" including food containers and medical equipment used on board the ship to treat sick migrants.\n\nProsecutors produced documentation filled out by the suspects that certified that no medical waste or contagious or infections substances were being thrown away. Prosecutors also provided wiretaps of communications between MSF personnel and the shipping agency about how to classify the material.\n\nA statement from prosecutors noted cases of scabies, HIV, tuberculosis and meningitis among newly arrived migrants and said their \"contaminated clothing\" risked spreading infection.\n\nAnother aid group that works with MSF aboard the Aquarius, SOS Mediterranee, denounced the ship's sequester as a \"politically driven attack\" and urged French authorities to \"show restraint\" as they weigh the seizure order from Italian prosecutors.\n\nItaly's hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who drove the June crackdown on the Aquarius and other aid groups, praised the Catania prosecutors for the new investigation, which also involved another rescue ship the Vos Prudence.\n\n\"I did the right thing by blocking the NGO ships, for not only stopping the traffic of clandestine migrants but also, apparently, the traffic in toxic waste,\" he tweeted with the hashtag #portsclosed."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Acquitted Christian woman wants to leave Pakistan for West", "description": "A Christian woman recently acquitted of blasphemy charges after eight years on death row in Pakistan wants to leave her homeland for any western country willing to issue visas for her and her family, her lawyer said Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/acquitted-christian-woman-wants-to-leave-pakistan-for-west", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-fc11a84ddf7341a882f4bfc2543f99d5.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:47:27Z", "content": "FRANKFURT, Germany A Christian woman recently acquitted of blasphemy charges after eight years on death row in Pakistan wants to leave her homeland for any western country willing to issue visas for her and her family, her lawyer said Tuesday.

Qadri also called for the overthrow of the Pakistan government. Protests ended after the government agreed to a Supreme Court review. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has gone on national television saying that the Supreme Court's decision will be final and upheld.\n\nBibi's ordeal dates back to 2009, when she went to fetch water for herself and fellow farmworkers. An argument took place after two Muslim women refused to drink from the same container as Bibi, who is Roman Catholic. The women later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, and she was charged with blasphemy. She was put on trial, convicted and sentenced to death in 2010.\n\nBibi and her family, who are currently at a guarded, secret location in Pakistan, don't speak any foreign languages so it wouldn't matter to them which western country would offer them refuge, Malook said.\n\nThe lawyer also left Pakistan after the Supreme Court's acquittal.

Two other hospital workers, Dr. Tamara O'Neal and Dayna Less, 25, a first-year pharmacy resident, were also killed in the shooting.\n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Jimenez was \"selfless in his actions,\" and added the city \"lost a doctor, pharmaceutical assistant and a police officer\" in the shooting.\n\nCHICAGO POLICE OFFICER CONFIRMED DEAD FOLLOWING HOSPITAL SHOOTING\n\n\"All [were] going about their day. All [were] doing what they love,\" Emanuel said. \"This tears at the soul of our city.\"\n\nThe attacker, identified by police as 32-year-old Juan Lopez, also died Monday but it was not clear if he took his own life or was killed by police at Mercy Hospital on the city's South Side, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.\n\nLopez had previously threatened to shoot up the Chicago Fire Academy after he was fired for \"improper conduct\" toward women there almost five years ago, the Chicago Tribune reported. Fire department spokesman Larry Langford told the paper that Lopez was accused of \"aggressive and improper conduct\" before he was terminated.\n\n\u201cHe had issues,\u201d Langford told the Tribune. \u201cHe was not getting along well.\"\n\nO'Neal appeared to be the intended target of the attack, after calling off her engagement with the gunman in September, WLS-TV reported.\n\nThe shooting spree began with a confrontation between Lopez and O'Neal in the parking lot of the hospital around 3:30 p.m., which the Chicago Tribune reported was over the \"broken engagement.\" A witness, who asked not to be identified, told WGN News that the doctor ran asking for help.\n\nCOP ACCIDENTALLY KILLS SECURITY GUARD AT BAR IN CHICAGO SUBURBS: REPORT\n\n\"She got on the phone and she was trying to call the police,\" the witness told WGN. \"She asked us not to leave her alone because he is going to kill her.\"\n\nCHICAGO POLICE OFFICER CONFIRMED DEAD FOLLOWING HOSPITAL SHOOTING\n\nLopez then approached O'Neal and demanded he give her a ring, the witness claimed. When she told the man she didn't have it, the man reemerged with a gun, according to the witness.\n\n\"The guy comes really quickly from behind the van and just pulls out a gun and shoots her six times before she even hits the ground,\" the witness told WGN.\n\nWhen police arrived at Mercy Hospital, Lopez had shot O'Neal repeatedly, standing over her as he fired the last shots, witness and police sources told the Chicago Tribune.\n\nLopez fired at the officer's squad car as they arrived before running inside the hospital. Inside the medical center, he then exchanged fire with officers and \"shot a poor woman who just came off the elevator\" before he was killed, Johnson said, referring to pharmaceutical resident Less.\n\n\"We just don't know how much damage he was prepared to do,\" Johnson said, adding that Less \"had nothing to do with nothing.\"\n\nLess was a first year pharmacy resident who had recently graduated from Purdue University, while O'Neal worked as emergency room physician who worked as a resident for two years but never worked on Sunday because of her religious faith.\n\nAn emotional Emergency Department director Patrick Connor said during a press conference that O'Neal would help raise money for disadvantaged children, and was dedicated to her congregation.\n\n\"That was her one thing she wanted, to be able to go to church on Sunday,\" he told reporters. \"We'll make sure you go to church on Sunday.\"\n\nDuring the gun battle in the lobby of the hospital, a second officer was also shot at but was not injured because a bullet struck his holster and embedded itself in his gun.\n\nThe death of Jimenez, a married father of three, comes nine months after another member of the Chicago Police Department, Cmdr. Paul Bauer, was fatally shot while pursuing a suspect in the Loop business district.\n\nPolice spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that Jimenez didn't typically work in the hospital area, but that the officer responded when he heard that shots were fired. He says it \"speaks volumes about his character.\"\n\nMercy has a rich history as the city's first chartered hospital. It began in 1852, when the Sisters of Mercy religious group converted a rooming house. During the Civil War, the hospital treated both Union soldiers and Confederate prisoners of war, according to its website.\n\nFox News' Nicole Darrah and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ahead of 2022 World Cup, Qatar still has a long way to go", "description": "With four years to go before the next World Cup opens in Qatar, the small gulf country's national soccer team is on the rise but still has a long, long way to go.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/ahead-of-2022-world-cup-qatar-still-has-a-long-way-to-go", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-b931e699508c4652bd1f19352a96f933.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T13:47:28Z", "content": "LUGANO, Switzerland With four years to go before the next World Cup opens in Qatar, the small gulf country's national soccer team is on the rise but still has a long, long way to go.

On Wednesday, exactly four years before the next World Cup is scheduled to open at Lusail Stadium outside Doha, the country still will be only No. 96.\n\nThere are positives, however, including Qatar's 1-0 victory over Switzerland last week in a friendly match \u2014 an eye-opening result against a team that reached the round of 16 at the last two World Cups.\n\n\"It's a big win for us especially (because) a lot of people don't know us,\" Qatar midfielder Assim Madibo said. \"I think they will know us more after this game ... Now we are only focusing on playing big games so we will get respect and people will know us.\"\n\nRespect has been hard to come by for Qatar's national team and the country's hosting of the tournament in general. The team's ranking has fluctuated between No. 78 and No. 112 since the December 2010 vote, and concerns about labor conditions for migrant workers has been an ongoing issue.\n\nThe win over Switzerland and subsequent 2-2 draw against Iceland were good signs, though a far cry from the progress Iceland has made in the same eight years, rising from No. 110 in the FIFA rankings to No. 36 following a quarterfinal run at the 2016 European Championship.\n\nStill, the team is improving under coach Felix Sanchez, who spent a decade as a youth coach at Barcelona before becoming Qatar's ninth coach in eight years.\n\nAgainst the Swiss, the Qataris defended well and played their way out of danger rather than kicking long balls out from the back. The passing was crisp and accurate and it was from one of the frequent attempts at a breakaway that Akram Afif scored the game's only goal in the 86th minute.\n\nThey're not quite Barcelona, but they're not too bad, either.\n\n\"I was working there for 10 years,\" Sanchez said of his time at Barcelona. \"When you go to work in a different place you need to adapt your philosophy. There are many things that we tried to keep and there are games where we can show more.\n\n\"There are games where we cannot do 100 percent what we have to do and of course you have the opposition in front ... we need to do more things that we're not used to do but it's the way to compete.\"\n\nMost of the players who traveled to Europe for the two friendlies are young and all are based in Qatar \u2014 90 percent of them having graduated from the state-of-the-art Aspire training academy. But with an average age of 24, many will be hitting their peak in 2022.\n\nQatar has also beaten Iraq, China, Palestine and Ecuador this year, but sterner competition is expected next year at both the Asian Cup and the Copa America, where the country is competing as a guest nation and could end up facing Brazil and Argentina.\n\n\"It's steps we have to do to arrive in 2022 ready to compete,\" said Sanchez, who knows his players well after working with most of them on under-age teams and at Aspire.\n\n\"Of course, for the players it's a big motivation to play against such teams and start to feel what is the real pressure in official competition against one of the top national teams in the world like Brazil, Argentina or one of those.\"\n\nAlthough Sanchez seems like the perfect fit because of his years of experience in Qatar, there is no guarantee he will still have his job in four years. Especially with high-profile possibilities like Pep Guardiola and Xavi Hernandez, both with experience playing in Qatar, being mentioned as potential future candidates.\n\nGuardiola's contract as manager at Manchester City expires in 2021, while Xavi \u2014 who plays for Qatari club Al Sadd \u2014 has said he would like to someday move into coaching.\n\n\"Of course it will be a dream to be there but four years in football is ... you cannot say,\" Sanchez said, smiling wryly. \"Hopefully.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Katherine Lam", "title": "James Woods uses Twitter to help veteran who said he's contemplating suicide - Fox News", "description": "Fox News James Woods uses Twitter to help veteran who said he's contemplating suicide Fox News James Woods took to Twitter on Monday to help a veteran who tweeted he was contemplating suicide.

He ran in Turkey's presidential election in June from his high-security prison in Edirne, northwest Turkey. He also campaigned for a constitutional referendum in 2017 from behind bars.\n\nIn September Demirtas was sentenced to four years in prison for supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and engaging in terrorist propaganda in one of several trials against him. He is appealing his conviction.\n\nAsked to comment on the European court's ruling, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said: \"We are not bound by the (European court's) decisions.\"\n\nHe added: \"We'll make our counter-move and finish it off.\" He did not elaborate.\n\nAs a signatory of a European convention to protect human rights, the court's decisions are legally binding on Turkey.\n\nJustice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said he needed to see the ruling, but added that a Turkish court would make the final decision on Demirtas' case.\n\nThe European court did not object to Demirta's initial arrest, but said there was no \"sufficient\" ground to justify the Turkish judicial authorities' extension of his detention period.\n\nThe court added that the extension of his detention time during the referendum and the presidential election had \"pursued the predominant ulterior purpose of stifling pluralism and limiting freedom of debate, which was at the very core of the concept of a democratic society.\"\n\nConsidered one of Turkey's most charismatic politicians, Demirtas broadened his party's appeal beyond Turkey's mostly Kurdish-populated southeast region, winning the support of left-leaning and liberal voters. His party, however, is criticized for not sufficiently distancing itself from Kurdish rebels."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Kosovo's bid to join Interpol rejected at agency's assembly", "description": "Kosovo's bid to join Interpol failed on Tuesday during a vote at the body's annual general assembly, dealing a blow to the country's efforts to boost recognition of its statehood.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/kosovos-bid-to-join-interpol-rejected-at-agencys-assembly", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-4dd60c413feb4dcda32133c6da0d6e19-1.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:08:26Z", "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates Kosovo's bid to join Interpol failed on Tuesday during a vote at the body's annual general assembly, dealing a blow to the country's efforts to boost recognition of its statehood. \"An application for membership by Kosovo was reject\u2026 [+2962 chars]", "fulltext": "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nKosovo's bid to join Interpol failed on Tuesday during a vote at the body's annual general assembly, dealing a blow to the country's efforts to boost recognition of its statehood.\n\n\"An application for membership by Kosovo was rejected by the INTERPOL General Assembly,\" the organization announced from its meeting held in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe bid's failure marks a significant setback for Kosovo \u2014 if it had been approved, Kosovo would have been able to request \"red notices\" from Interpol for arrests of Serbian officials or figures that authorities in Kosovo consider war criminals.\n\nSupported by its ally Russia, Serbia had been lobbying against Kosovo's entry into Interpol. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia. The United States and most of the Western states support Kosovo's statehood.\n\nSerbia's leaders rejoiced over the outcome. President Aleksandar Vucic held a press conference hailing the vote as a \"victory\" for Serbia.\n\n\"I am proud of our country's struggle,\" he said. \"I want to believe that this will be a clear, undoubted message to Europe and the world to understand that things cannot be solved with one-sided pressure.\"\n\nKosovo's government expresses disappointment, saying in a statement that \"Serbia's wild campaign shows once again its stand against Kosovo and against the idea of normalizing ties.\"\n\n\"Voting against Kosovo's accession in this international organization only serves ... criminals and no one should rejoice,\" it said.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kosovo also expressed disappointment with the outcome of the vote in Dubai.\n\n\"Support for Kosovo's INTERPOL membership was never about recognition of Kosovo's independence, but about strengthening global law enforcement cooperation and closing a critical security gap in the Balkans. With this outcome, we all lose,\" it said.\n\nKosovo needed two-thirds of votes cast to be approved for full membership to Interpol. The body, instead, approved new member countries Kiribati and Vanuatu to join Interpol, brining global membership to 194 countries.\n\nInterpol acts as a clearinghouse for national police services that want to hunt down suspects outside their borders. Its red notices are alerts circulated to all member countries that identify a person wanted for arrest by another country. Interpol says there are 57,289 active red notices around the world.\n\nThe body, however, has faced criticism that governments have abused the \"red notice\" system to go after political enemies and dissidents, even though its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality and prohibits the use of police notices for political reasons. Member-states have final say on whether or not to make arrests based on the red notices.\n\nTwo years ago, Interpol introduced new measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice's compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out. Interpol also says it enhanced the work of an appeals body for those targeted with red notices.\n\n___\n\nStojanovic reported from Belgrade, Serbia, and Llazar Semini from Tirana, Albania."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Laura Ingraham", "title": "Laura Ingraham: Is Trump trying a new approach to governance since the midterms?

The president was clearly moved by the extent of the devastation.\n\nHe said, \u201cNobody would've ever thought this could have happened. So, the federal government is behind you. We are all behind each other. I think we can say truly, Jerry, right? Jerry and I have been speaking and Gavin and I have now gotten to know each other and were all going to work together and we will do a real job. But this is very sad to see. As far as the lives are concerned, nobody knows quite yet. They are up to a certain number but we have a lot of people that are unaccounted for. I think we are all in the same path.\u201d\n\nWhat was unexpected was how Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom responded to their day with the president. And of course his personal interest in the tragedy.\n\nGovernor Brown said this, \u201cI really appreciate the president being here and putting the focus and the spotlight on probably the worst tragedy that California has ever seen.\u201d\n\nGovernor-elect Newsom said, \u201cThere is [sic] no politics being played here. The expectation going forward that the federal government is not just going to be here today with all of you but tomorrow and over the course of the next few years as we rebuild.\n\nWell, sure the cynics are going to say this is all just a show because Brown and Newsom, they know they are going to need the federal government's help to recover from the worst fires in the state's history, but still, it was nice to see.\n\nIn the last few weeks, notwithstanding some ill-advised tweets about Adam Schiff's name and retired Navy Admiral William McRaven, President Trump seems to be projecting a different dimension of himself. Understanding now that he has the Democratically-controlled house and he has to contend with that, might President Trump be trying a new approach to governance? Should he?\n\nWill this change minds and grow support for his economic agenda? It's clearly working. But beyond all of that, wouldn't it be good for the country? I get the sense, maybe you do, too, that Americans have undoubtedly grown weary of how politics has infected so much of our daily lives. Not that it's not important, it obviously is or I wouldn't be doing this every night.\n\nBut it's not everything. And it shouldn't be a blood sport every single day.\n\nThe president doesn't need to swing at every pitch. Nor does he need to respond to every unfair criticism no matter how vile it is. Not even when it comes from self-absorbed media figures.\n\nNow, this Thursday is supposed to be a time when we all gather around the table to give thanks. Not to get stuffing thrown at us by Cousin Helen or Uncle Joe who is in a white rage about the president's views on climate change or something.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, the president has decided to modestly recalibrate his approach to his job and find places where both parties can agree even as the critics persist.\n\nNow, believe me, I am not saying he should change his goals on core issues like trade or immigration. He is doing great on both.\n\nBut he could be changing how he pursues them. I think the president needs more happy, not more anxious, voters going into 2020.\n\nA recent Morning Consult poll showed that 64 percent of voters believe the media have divided the country while 56 percent -- not an insignificant number -- blame the president.\n\nNow, it's not surprising that nearly two-thirds of Americans blame the press given how biased and how completely unbalanced most of them are, and they have been towards this president since the beginning:\n\nNow, the vitriol from both the hard left and the media and yes, there is some overlap there, is spewed even as President Trump has attempted bipartisan outreach on issues such as immigration reform. -- Remember, the Democrats rejected it last February.\n\nYou know, others might have responded to the political stonewalling by the Democrats with a \"to hell with the whole bipartisan thing.\" But not Trump. He is undeterred, trying to find common ground, announcing his support last week of an issue that Democrats once heartily clamored for. I'm talking about criminal justice reform.\n\nHere\u2019s what the president said last week at the White House as he spoke about the \u201cFirst Step Act\u201d:\n\n\u201cAmericans from across the political spectrum can unite around prison reform legislation that will reduce crime while giving our fellow citizens a chance at redemption, so if something happens and they make a mistake, they get a second chance at life.\u201d\n\nThis got about as much coverage as his visit to California this weekend. In other words, not that much.\n\nNot one Senate Democrat attended the White House announcement which I found to be a disgrace. This political slight was not lost, by the way, on Senator Cory Booker's home paper.\n\nMonday, the Star-Ledger wrote the following, \"Booker, who has made a huge issue about justice reform, should have gone to the White House and showed bipartisanship. Democrats can engage with the White House and show independence at the same time.\"\n\nApparently not.\n\nThe left's new strategy is to completely deny that Trump has accomplished anything positive and to deny him any cooperation even on issues where they agree.\n\nNow, how sick is that?\n\nOnly a few fair-minded liberals like CNN's Van Jones, who worked with the White House, including Jared Kushner, on this bill, actually celebrated the accomplishment.\n\nHere\u2019s how Jones put it: \u201cPresident Trump said listen, if this is going to make streets safer, if it's going to give people a fair chance, if some of these forgotten men and women, some of them are in Appalachia as well. Let's do something. And so listen, I think you got to give him some credit. I will give him a salute and an applause.\u201d\n\nAnd for that statement of support, Jones was lacerated.\n\nProfessor Crystal Marie Fleming tweeted \"Give the white supremacist misogynist his due, Van Jones says.\"\n\nOthers were equally unhinged.\n\nMichael Harriet at The Root saying no, Van Jones, I do not have to give the racist-in-chief his due.\n\nSo much for common cause.\n\nBy the way, for all you looking to the Obama presidency through these rose-colored glasses today, this is what the country felt about the state of America six years into Obama's presidency: Fifty-five percent said Obama had done more to divide than unite the country. Well? Now, this is something the president at the time said he had to admit when he gave his final state of the union address.\n\n\u201cIt's one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.\u201d\n\nWell, are things today worse? Maybe. And both folks from both parties, they could do better, including the president. Including me. All of us, I guess. And we should celebrate though the president because he is trying to reach across the aisle. Criminal justice reform is just one of the examples. And just because haters on the left are going to ridicule him or belittle the president's efforts, it's no reason for the president to back off.\n\nHis trip to California, prison reform, his work to lift the standard of living of minority communities, they\u2019re all positive signs.\n\nThere are those who will work overtime to deflect and demean any efforts by this president to broaden his appeal. And most importantly, to broaden the appeal of his policies that, again, are working.\n\nI say let the critics do what the critics are going to do. This will make them look petty and just purely partisan.\n\nReagan appealed to women and minorities by smiling through the storm, always keeping the focus on the lives of everyday Americans.\n\nTrump calls them \u201cthe forgotten people,\u201d their families, their jobs, their neighborhoods, their faith.\n\nBy taking the focus off himself and keeping it on the horizon of possibility, the president will unmask the real dividers and give voters more of what they are hungering for: unity through strength.\n\nAdapted from Laura Ingraham\u2019s monologue on \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d on November 20, 2018."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Prominent separatist leader killed in Indian Kashmir", "description": "Assailants on Tuesday killed a prominent separatist leader in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials and residents said, as anti-India protests and clashes followed a gunbattle that killed four rebels and an army commando in the disputed region.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/prominent-separatist-leader-killed-in-indian-kashmir", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:47:15Z", "content": "SRINAGAR, India Assailants on Tuesday killed a prominent separatist leader in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials and residents said, as anti-India protests and clashes followed a gunbattle that killed four rebels and an army commando in the disputed region.\u2026 [+2100 chars]", "fulltext": "Assailants on Tuesday killed a prominent separatist leader in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials and residents said, as anti-India protests and clashes followed a gunbattle that killed four rebels and an army commando in the disputed region.\n\nFighting began early Tuesday after police and soldiers cordoned off a village on a tip that militants were hiding in a civilian house, said army spokesman Col.

Street fighting was also underway in the main Khamsin Str. in the city center and in al-Saleh district. The officials spoke about the clashes on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters; the witnesses did so for fear for their safety.\n\nInformation Minister Moammer al-Iryani, who is in Yemen's internationally recognized government, said the Houthis shelled the city center and neighborhoods held by government forces.

Weeks ago, 30 families or more were being allowed to cross the border daily at Yuma, Ariz. to apply for asylum. In the past two weeks, migrants and advocates say, U.C. Customs and Border Protection officials have slashed that number to one family a day at most.\n\nMeanwhile, Homeland Security officials revealed Monday that more than 500 criminals are traveling with the migrant caravan that\u2019s massed on the other side of a San Diego border crossing. Homeland Security officials say there are 6,000 people in Tijuana waiting to be processed at the San Ysidro border crossing, with more on the way. Those who have already entered the border city in the past few days have been met with an icy reception. Migrant groups are beginng to realize they may have to wait six months for their asylum claims to be heard. The caravan arrivals are expected to continue into the week ahead. - Reported by Edmund De Marche (@EDeMarche on Twitter) and Greg Norman\n\nDEM CIVIL WAR: Sixteen House Democratic lawmakers circulated a letter Monday vowing to vote against Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House, calling for \"new leadership\" -- even though no challenger has stepped up to run against the California Democrat ... \u201cWe are thankful to Leader Pelosi for her years of service to our Country and to our Caucus. She is a historic figure whose leadership has been instrumental to some of our party\u2019s most important legislative achievements,\u201d the letter from both incumbent and newly elected Democrats read. \u201cHowever, we also recognize that in this recent election, Democrats ran and won on a message of change.\u201d\n\nThe letter was signed by former Pelosi challenger Rep.

Mareli Miniutti, an actress who appeared in \"Ocean\u2019s 8,\" filed the domestic violence restraining order Monday in Los Angeles, the report said. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Miniutti was the woman who accused Avenatti of domestic violence last week.\n\nAvenatti responded to the restraining order with a tweet: \"I have NEVER abused a woman or committed domestic violence.

THE WAR HERO: House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on Monday appeared to side with retired Navy Admiral William McRaven\u2014 the official best known for overseeing the Navy SEAL mission to kill Usama bin Laden\u2014after President Trump questioned why McRaven took so long to find the Al Qaeda leader ... Trump told \u201cFOX News Sunday\u201d that McRaven is a \u201cHillary Clinton fan\u201d and an \u201cObama backer.\u201d The Republican National Committee echoed the president\u2019s comments, tweeting that McRaven has been critical of Trump from as far back as the 2016 campaign. Ryan said in a statement on Monday that the U.S. is grateful for McRaven and all members of the military who have served in harm\u2019s way and \u201chave put country before self,\u201d according to The Hill. McRaven has repeatedly criticized Trump over the president's description of journalists as \"the enemy of the American people,\" writing in February 2017 that those comments represented \"perhaps the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.\" - Samuel Chamberlain (@SChamberlainFOX on Twitter) and Edmund De Marche\n\nNEW RULES: The White House will not seek to again revoke CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta's hard press pass, as first reported on Monday by FOX News' John Roberts ... \u201cToday the White House fully restored Jim Acosta's press pass. As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary. We look forward to continuing to cover the White House,\u201d CNN said in a statement. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also implemented a series of rules that will govern White House press conferences going forward.\n\nAccording to Sanders, the new rules include: (1) A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists. (2) At the discretion of the president or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted; and where a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor. - Reported by Brian Flood (@briansflood on Twitter)\n\nMichael Goodwin: Jim Acosta abused his privileges as a member of the press\n\n\n\nAS SEEN ON FOX NEWS\n\nWHEN A JOKE BOMBS - \"I think he just nuked his [presidential] chances.\" \u2013 Jesse Watters, on \"The Five,\" discussing how U.S. Rep.

It produces 3.2 million tons of mismanaged plastic waste a year, of which 1.29 million tons ends up in the ocean, the study said.\n\nLuhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesia's coordinating minister of maritime affairs, said the whale's discovery should raise public awareness about the need to reduce plastic use, and had spurred the government to take tougher measures to protect the ocean.\n\n\"I'm so sad to hear this,\" said Pandjaitan, who recently has campaigned for less use of plastic. \"It is possible that many other marine animals are also contaminated with plastic waste and this is very dangerous for our lives.\"\n\nHe said the government is making efforts to reduce the use of plastic, including urging shops not to provide plastic bags for customers and teaching about the problem in schools nationwide to meet a government target of reducing plastic use by 70 percent by 2025.\n\n\"This big ambition can be achieved if people learn to understand that plastic waste is a common enemy,\" he told The Associated Press."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Backlash at Chinese university shows limits to surveillance", "description": "A Chinese university's plan to conduct a blanket search of student and staff electronic devices has come under fire, illustrating the limits of the population's tolerance for surveillance and raising the prospect that tactics used on Muslim minorities may be \u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/backlash-at-chinese-university-shows-limits-to-surveillance", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-cf5a5d851943452dae48358f7bf6a5c0.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T09:47:21Z", "content": "BEIJING A Chinese university's plan to conduct a blanket search of student and staff electronic devices has come under fire, illustrating the limits of the population's tolerance for surveillance and raising the prospect that tactics used on Muslim minorities\u2026 [+5415 chars]", "fulltext": "A Chinese university's plan to conduct a blanket search of student and staff electronic devices has come under fire, illustrating the limits of the population's tolerance for surveillance and raising the prospect that tactics used on Muslim minorities may be creeping into the rest of the country.\n\nThe Guilin University of Electronic Technology is reconsidering a search of cellphones, computers, external hard disks and USB drives after a copy of the order leaked online and triggered such an intense backlash that it drew rare criticism in state-run newspapers.\n\nSearches of electronics are common in Xinjiang in China's far west, a heavily Muslim region that has been turned into a virtual police state to tamp down unrest. They are unheard of in most other areas, including where the school is located in the southern Guangxi region, a popular tourist destination known for spectacular scenery, not violence or terrorism.\n\nThat's why the planned checks worry some.\n\n\"Xinjiang has emerged as China's surveillance laboratory,\" said James Leibold, a scholar of Chinese ethnic politics and national identity at La Trobe University in Australia. \"It is unsurprising that some of the methods first pioneered in China's west are now being rolled out in other regions.\"\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, the government has in recent years tried to tighten controls over what the public sees and says online and stepped up political oversight of universities. Sometimes, these measures have run into a new generation of Chinese accustomed to greater freedoms, sparking public outcry and occasionally government retreat.\n\nThe leaked notice in Guilin warned that hostile domestic groups and foreign powers are \"wantonly spreading illicit and illegal videos\" through the internet. It said the search for violent, terrorist, reactionary and obscene content, which was to be conducted this month, was necessary to resist and combat extremist recordings that it called mentally harmful.\n\nThe order triggered a public uproar last week.\n\nPosts on China's Twitter-like Weibo site with hashtags on schools checking electronic devices were viewed nearly 80 million times. Users voiced privacy concerns, comparing the measure to computer chips inserted in brains and the George Orwell novel \"1984.\"\n\nThen came critical editorials in state-run publications saying the notice could violate Chinese constitutional protection of the right to communicate freely and have those communications remain confidential.\n\n\"If colleges and universities check the phones, computers, and hard disks of teachers and students, they're suspected of infringing on communication freedom and privacy,\" said an editorial in the Beijing Youth Daily. \"Those responsible at the school should be held accountable, as they had a great negative impact on the school's image.\"\n\nAdministrators told another state-owned publication, \"The Paper,\" that the search had not yet been carried out, and that they were considering reducing its scope. University and local education ministry officials referred questions to a media office, which did not answer repeated phone calls.\n\nWeibo, while not a government body, ran into hot water in April when it said it would censor content related to gay issues on its microblog. The company backpedaled under intense criticism, including from state-run publications.\n\nIt's unclear what prompted the Guilin university's planned search. It could have been a trial run to see how the public would react or an overzealous local administrator, said Christopher Colley, a National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates assistant professor who has lectured at Chinese universities.\n\nEither way, he said, the backlash shows that though online censorship is common in China, physical searches of phones and laptops is an extreme measure that many will not accept.\n\n\"Most people in China are willing to tolerate Big Brother as long as it contributes to social stability, but for many, this is going too far,\" Colley said.\n\nSchools in Xinjiang have been conducting similar searches since the region's highest court in early 2014 issued a notice forbidding audio and video recordings promoting terrorism, religious extremism and ethnic division.\n\nTeachers and administrators at Xinjiang Normal University's College of Physics and Electronics searched electronic devices in every dormitory on campus on Nov. 9, 2014. A post about the search on the school's website says, \"Through investigating violent and terroristic videos, religious extremism on campus has been weakened.\"\n\nIn 2017, China University of Petroleum's branch in Karamay, a city in oil country in Xinjiang's north, ordered various school departments to assign inspectors to search the computers of all teachers on campus.\n\nXinjiang is home to a large Uighur population, a Muslim ethnic group that has long harbored simmering resentment against rule from Beijing. A series of riots and attacks blamed on separatist Uighurs has prompted a sweeping crackdown on Muslims in the region.\n\nChina has rolled out one of the world's most aggressive surveillance and policing programs both in Xinjiang and neighboring Tibet.\n\nUighurs are regularly singled out and stopped at checkpoints to have their smartphones scanned for religious content. As The Associated Press reported in May, they risk being detained and sent to internment camps if police find songs or videos they deem suspicious or apps that are commonly used to contact people outside China, such as WhatsApp.\n\n\"Xinjiang today appears to be the leading-edge of a highly intrusive and coercive surveillance society that the (Communist Party) is intent on constructing across China,\" Leibold said."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Seoul: North Korea destroys 10 guard posts to lower tensions", "description": "North Korea on Tuesday blew up some of its front-line guard posts as part of an agreement to ease tensions along its heavily fortified border with South Korea, Seoul's Defense Ministry said.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/seoul-north-korea-destroys-10-guard-posts-to-lower-tensions", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-802a228bafaa4add82bfa70f32f08d7d.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T08:47:22Z", "content": "SEOUL, South Korea North Korea on Tuesday blew up some of its front-line guard posts as part of an agreement to ease tensions along its heavily fortified border with South Korea, Seoul's Defense Ministry said.

They later withdrew weapons and troops from 11 of their guard posts and decided to completely dismantle 10 of them by the end of November.\n\nSeoul's Defense Ministry said it confirmed the dismantling of 10 North Korean guard posts on Tuesday. A ministry statement said North Korea had informed the South of its plans in advance.\n\nSouth Korea began dismantling 10 of its guard posts with dynamite and excavators last week. Ministry officials said Tuesday that they haven't completed the demolitions yet.\n\nThe Korean border, the world's most heavily armed with an estimated 2 million land mines, has been the site of deadly fighting and bloodshed. Called the Demilitarized Zone, it was originally created as a buffer at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nSouth Korea had about 60 posts inside the DMZ guarded by layers of barbed wire and manned by troops with machine guns. North Korea was estimated to have 160 such front-line posts. Once the dismantling is done, the two Koreas are to jointly verify their work by the end of December. They haven't decided when they will dismantle the rest of the guard posts.\n\nUnder the September agreements, the Koreas have also taken steps to disarm their shared border village of Panmunjom, halted live-fire drills along the border and have been removing mines at a front-line area to conduct their first joint searches for Korean War dead.\n\nRelations between the Koreas have improved since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reached out to South Korea and the United States early this year with a vague promise to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. U.S.-North Korea talks on the North's nuclear program haven't produced much progress since Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump held the countries' first summit in Singapore in June."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "William Sanchez", "title": "The Speaker\u2019s Lobby: It\u2019s Going To Get Ugly", "description": "11/20/2018 Fox's Chad Pergram talks about the Speaker's Race in today's \"Speaker's Lobby.\" Fox's Chad Pergram I'm Chad Pergram with the Speaker's Lobby.

Yet, like other desperate young men in Gaza who feel they have nothing left to lose, he has kept returning to the protests.\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been on the front line of confrontations between Palestinians and Israel for generations. But the territory has been brought to its knees over the last decade by three punishing wars with Israel and an air, sea and land blockade.\n\nThe 11-year blockade, imposed by Israel and Egypt, is aimed at weakening Hamas, the militant group that seized power in Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. But its impact is felt by all. Raw sewage flows directly onto once-scenic Mediterranean beaches, tap water is undrinkable, and electricity is available just a few hours a day. Over half the Gaza Strip's 2 million people are unemployed, and most residents cannot leave.\n\nWhile most Gazans see the protests as the inevitable reaction to Israel's siege, Israel views them as coordinated attacks and says it must defend itself.\n\nSince they began on March 30, Israeli troops have killed more than 170 people and shot nearly 6,000 others. Thousands more have been wounded by tear gas or rubber-coated bullets. On the Israeli side, one soldier was killed by a sniper and six others wounded.\n\nEvery Friday, there are more.\n\nWhen Fayoumi arrived at one of five protest sites along the border just after 2:30 p.m., the area was largely empty. A few days earlier, he swore he would keep participating despite his wounds. But why?\n\n\"Because I want to die,\" he said.\n\nYes, he hopes the blockade gets lifted so he can leave Gaza to get a new, prosthetic leg. But if that doesn't happen, \"what's the point of living?\"\n\nBy 5 p.m., at least 13,000 people are gathered along the border, throwing rocks and burning tires. Ambulance sirens begin to howl soon after, signaling the start of the day's violence. At a medical triage tent about a kilometer (half a mile) from the frontier, they bring the wounded: a 22-year-old shot in the left leg, an 18-year-old struck by shrapnel, a 31-year-old shot in the chest.\n\n\"Every Friday we wait for the injuries, and every Friday it's always the same,\" says one of the staff, Dr. Khalil Siam. \"They always come.\"\n\nA few dozen meters (yards) away, five men in checkered, black and white headscarves are performing a traditional folk dance with their arms crossed for a captivated crowd under a massive tent. Behind them, in the distance, the border fence looks like a war zone; the sky is completely black, burning tires are shooting flames into the air, and gunfire is ringing out every few minutes.\n\nAt the border, all hell is breaking loose. Protesters are swarming the 12-foot-high fence. One man is hanging from the top, shaking it back and forth. The noise is constant, like a waterfall. Men are blowing whistles. Others are screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nMost are throwing rocks over the fence, thrusting their fists in the air, taking selfies, waving Palestinian flags. Every time a gunshot rings out, they duck like a school of fish darting in unison. Sometimes a man falls, and within seconds he is surrounded by medics in orange uniforms, who bandage him on the spot and rush him on a stretcher to the ambulances waiting in the rear.\n\nAfter the sun sets, the crowds dissipate rapidly as two black drones circle overhead. A pair of nearby explosions sends shards of concrete and debris hurling into the air. The Israeli army will say that aircraft and a tank struck two Hamas watchtowers after a soldier was wounded by a pipe bomb.\n\nThe last casualty arrives at the medical tent at 7:24 p.m. Siam says his team treated 25 people, mostly for gunshot wounds. Half were shot in the leg.\n\nAlmost every Friday protest is followed by at least one funeral on Saturday. This week, there are three, including one for an 11-year-old boy.\n\nOn Sunday, Fayoumi is sitting on the small bed in his small room, showing off pictures of himself at Friday's protest.\n\nHe is proud that he went. Proud that he stood up for the Palestinian cause. But when asked if having a job would have changed anything, his answer is clear: \"I would never have gone.\"\n\nAfter his injury, Fayoumi received a payment of $200 from Hamas.

Over the next few hours, Fayoumi knows the crowds will swell into the thousands. They'll burn so many tires, the sky will turn black. They'll attack the fence with stones and firebombs, Israeli gunfire will ring out, and Palestinian ambulance sirens will wail non-stop.\n\nBy the time it is over, at least 80 Palestinians will be wounded and three will be dead.\n\nAt sunset, Fayoumi and the others will abruptly turn around and walk home, while the Israelis will emerge from their positions and march the other way.\n\nIn a week, like clockwork, they will be back, poised for the deadly ritual to start all over again.\n\n___\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been the front line of confrontations between Palestinians and Israel for generations.

But its impact is felt by all. Raw sewage flows directly onto once-scenic Mediterranean beaches, tap water is undrinkable, and electricity is available just a few hours a day. Over half the Gaza Strip's 2 million people are unemployed, and most residents cannot leave what has become, in essence, a mass prison, even for medical reasons.\n\nThe blockade and growing anger over the harsh living conditions have put enormous pressure on Hamas, which is trying to redirect it toward Israel with relentless protests, said Mkhaimar Abusada, an associate professor of political science at Gaza's al-Azhar University.\n\n\"But it's a very slippery slope,\" Abusada said. \"Because they're not going to stop until the siege is lifted \u2014 or there is another war.\"\n\nThat almost happened this month, when an Israeli raid into Gaza left seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli military officer dead. The raid prompted Hamas and other armed groups to fire hundreds of rockets and mortar shells into Israel, triggering a devastating wave of Israeli airstrikes in return \u2014 the heaviest fighting here since a 2014 war.\n\nBoth parties pulled back from the brink with a truce, and Hamas kept last Friday's protests restrained \u2014 though not enough to keep 40 Palestinians from being wounded.\n\nWhile most Gazans see the protests as the inevitable reaction to Israel's siege, Israel sees the confrontations as violent attacks spearheaded by a terrorist organization.\n\nSince they began March 30, Israeli troops \u2014 using live ammunition against Palestinians mostly armed with rocks \u2014 have killed more than 170 people and shot nearly 6,000 others, among them scores of children. Thousands more have been wounded during the protests by tear gas or rubber-coated bullets. On the Israeli side, one soldier has been killed by a sniper and six others wounded.\n\nEvery Friday, there are more.\n\n___\n\nIt is 2:30 p.m. in Malaka, one of five protest sites along the border, and several boys are practicing for a fight.\n\nThey are flinging large rocks onto a barren field with homemade slingshots. One of them, 17-year-old Ahmed al-Burdaini, shows off a bucket filled with fragments of steel rebar he says he spent the week collecting from the rubble of homes destroyed in past Israeli airstrikes.\n\n\"We want to use it against them,\" he says proudly.\n\nAnother boy points across the frontier and writes in a reporter's notebook: \"This Is Our Land.\" It is a reference to another demand of the protests, that Palestinians be allowed to return to lands lost during the 1948 war that created the Jewish state \u2014 a demand Israel rejects outright.\n\nThe perimeter fence itself is a few hundred meters (yards) away. Israeli soldiers on the other side peer out from bunkers built atop pyramid-shaped berms along the fence.\n\nThe protest site is still largely empty, but people are trickling in. Among them is the amputee, Fayoumi, who says he was throwing rocks near the fence and was shot as he rushed to help a wounded friend. A few days earlier, speaking at a clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, he swore he would keep participating in the protests despite his wounds. But why risk it?\n\n\"Because I want to die,\" he said.\n\nHe would prefer for the blockade to be lifted so he could leave Gaza to get a new, prosthetic leg. But if that doesn't happen, \"what's the point of living?\"\n\nThe sun is bearing down intensely when a couple dozen Palestinians roll a few tires toward the fence and set them on fire. The first gunshots ring out at 3:14 p.m., in the standard Israeli response to the start of the protests. An armored Israeli jeep at the edge of the fence fires a volley of tear gas canisters that leave white arcs trailing across the sky as they fall. The protesters are unfazed.\n\nAmong the growing crowds is an incongruous sight: five street vendors pushing dilapidated food carts hawking seeds, nuts, and frozen slushies. One is affixed with a cheap wooden speaker blaring traditional Bedouin music. It gives the protest the atmosphere of a country fair.\n\nVendor Adam Badwan, 17, has a simple explanation for coming: \"Business is good here, much better than in town.\"\n\nPlainclothes Hamas security agents appear. A local television crew arrives with flak jackets and helmets. A single ambulance pulls up.\n\nAfter Friday noon prayers, around 4 p.m., Hamas dispatches huge buses to many mosques to bring supporters to the border. But many more come on their own \u2014 on foot, in cars, motorcycles, bikes and wheelchairs. Within one hour, at least 13,000 people are gathered along the border.\n\n___\n\nDr. Khalil Siam is standing inside a medical triage tent about a kilometer (half a mile) from the border when the ambulance sirens begin to howl just after 5 p.m.\n\nThe first one to arrive drops off a 22-year-old man who was shot in the left leg. The second brings an 18-year-old, blood streaming from his bandaged face, who was struck by shrapnel.\n\nWhen the third comes shortly after, bearing a 31-year-old shot in the chest, there is shouting and panic \u2014 and no doubt the most dangerous phase of the protests has begun. The bullet has punctured the man's lung, and he is lowered gently onto a gurney as eight doctors and nurses gather round.\n\nOne of the doctors inserts a clear tube into the man's chest, and within seconds, blood and liquid is draining into a blue plastic bowl on the floor.\n\n\"Keep breathing! Keep breathing!\"\n\n\"Every Friday we wait for the injuries, and every Friday it's always the same,\" says Siam. \"They always come.\"\n\nOutside, a convoy of vehicles passes. Young men are standing on them, thrusting fists in the air, their faces hidden with scarves and white Guy Fawkes masks. It is the \"Burning Tire Unit\" \u2014 and soon it will fill a vast section of the frontier with a wall of fire and billowing sheets of smoke.\n\nA few dozen meters (yards) away, five men in checkered, black and white headscarves are performing a traditional folk dance with their arms crossed for a captivated crowd under a massive tent. Behind them, in the distance, the border fence looks like a war zone; the sky is completely black, burning tires are shooting flames into the air, and gunfire is ringing out every few minutes.\n\nBut nobody is looking toward the border, and few notice the steady stream of ambulances that are crisscrossing the adjacent road, non-stop. Here, vendors are selling corn on the cob and peanuts, and fathers are balancing children on their shoulders.\n\nIn the sky behind the stage, four kites flutter in the wind, several with flaming, incendiary trails; such kites have burned thousands of acres of Israeli farmland and set vehicles alight.\n\nColorful balloons also float overhead; Israel says they have found them on the other side of the fence, tied to small, homemade bombs.\n\nIt is 5:45 p.m. now, and the air is growing cooler. The dancers are soon replaced by a poet, then a play featuring two actors dressed as Israeli guards who shove a Palestinian prisoner to the ground. At one point, the prisoner tells the guard: \"Resistance is not terrorism.\"\n\nThe crowd applauds.\n\n___\n\nBy 6 p.m., at the border, all hell is breaking loose.\n\nHundreds of hard-core protesters are swarming the 12-foot-high fence. The wall of smoke has allowed some, armed with wire cutters, to clip through the rolls of barbed wire. One man is hanging from the top of the fence, shaking it back and forth with the weight of his body. Another is hanging from the other side, and yet another is trying to melt the fence with a flaming tire.\n\nThe noise here is constant, like a waterfall. Men are blowing whistles. Others are screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\n\"Allahu akbar!\" \u2014 God is great!\n\nMost are throwing rocks over the fence, thrusting their fists in the air, taking selfies, making the V sign for Victory. There are women too, wearing black and waving Palestinian flags. There is a man with a speaker on his back, playing Palestinian music to encourage them. Some boys pick up smoking tear gas canisters and smack them back over the fence with tennis rackets.\n\nEvery time a gunshot rings out, the crowds duck, like a school of fish darting in unison. Sometimes a man falls, and within seconds he is surrounded by medics in orange uniforms, who bandage him on the spot and rush him on a stretcher to the ambulances waiting in the rear.\n\nFurther back stands a vast sea of spectators. One, an older man named Khalil Ayesh, is sitting inside a light blue Subaru with his family, as if he has come to a drive-in movie. He was in the same spot last week, watching intently as an Israeli drone crisscrossed the sky like a black spider, dropping tear gas on the crowds from above.\n\n\"I bring them every week,\" Ayesh said of the three children in the back seat \u2014 his son and daughter, and his daughter's neighbor, \"so they can understand what this struggle is about.\"\n\nAfter the sun sets, the crowds dissipate rapidly as two black drones circle overhead. At 6:52 p.m., a huge blast a kilometer (half a mile) from the frontier sends shards of concrete and debris hurling into the air. Eight minutes later, it happens again. Later, in a statement, the Israeli army will say that aircraft and a tank struck two Hamas watchtowers after one of their soldiers was wounded by a pipe bomb.\n\nIt is time to go.\n\nAt the medical tent, it is now pitch dark, and the last casualty arrives at 7:24 p.m. It is a man, bleeding from the head, who has been hit by a tear gas canister.\n\nSiam says his team treated 25 people on this Friday, mostly for gunshot wounds. Half were shot in the leg, the others in the chest, stomach, back, pelvis. One doctor had to take leave when his nephew arrived, shot in the head.\n\n___\n\nAlmost every Friday protest in Gaza is followed by at least one funeral on Saturday. This week, there are three.\n\nOne, for an 11-year-old boy named Shady Abdel-al, is remarkable because it is quiet. Funeral processions here typically are accompanied by young men doing something they usually avoid at the border: firing Kalashnikov rifles into the sky.\n\nThough the Health Ministry initially reported Abdel-al was shot by Israeli fire, the Israeli army claimed he was accidentally struck by a rock thrown by protesters. Two Gaza rights groups say he died after being hit \"with a solid object.\"\n\nDuring his funeral, Gaza's political complexity is laid bare. His body has been wrapped in a yellow flag with a grenade and automatic rifle on it; it belongs to Fatah, the party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and a bitter rival to Hamas.\n\nAbdel-al's mother, Isma, says she told the boy not to go, but he boarded a bus to the border organized by Hamas, whose supporters were teaching him the Quran.\n\nAs the boy's body is carried through the neighborhood, it is surrounded by a sea of yellow flags. But when it reaches the mosque, there is another huge group of teenagers waiting with the green flag of Hamas. Hassan Walli, a Fatah official, is with the family as the distraught father stands over his son, kissing him on the forehead.\n\n\"We will never break the siege this way,\" Walli says, shaking his head. \"The only way we can do it is with Palestinian unity.\"\n\n___\n\nIt is Sunday in Gaza, and Atalla Fayoumi is sitting on the small bed in his small room, showing off pictures of himself at Friday's protest.\n\nHe is proud that he went. Proud that he stood up for the Palestinian cause. But when asked if having a job would have changed anything, his answer is clear: \"I would never have gone.\"\n\nAfter his injury, Fayoumi received a payment of US$200 from Hamas. It was spent long ago, he says, on medical bills.\n\nNow he has nothing. No work. No hope.

Meanwhile, only 4 of 31 wild birds in a forest in the western town of Maricao survived, along with 75 out of 134 wild parrots living in the Rio Abajo forest in the central mountains of Puerto Rico, scientists said.\n\nAnd while several dozen new parrots have been born in captivity and in the wild since Maria, the species is still in danger, according to scientists.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do,\" said Gustavo Olivieri, parrot recovery program coordinator for Puerto Rico's Department of Natural Resources.\n\nFederal and local scientists will meet next month to debate how best to revive a species that numbered more than 1 million in the 1800s but dwindled to 13 birds during the 1970s after decades of forest clearing.\n\nThe U.S. and Puerto Rican governments launched a program in 1972 that eventually led to the creation of three breeding centers. Just weeks before Maria hit, scientists reported 56 wild birds at El Yunque, the highest since the program was launched.\n\nBut the population decline is now especially worrisome because the parrots that vanished from El Yunque were some of the last remaining wild ones, said Marisel Lopez, who oversees the parrot recovery program at El Yunque for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\n\"It was devastating. After so many years of having worked on this project...,\" she stopped talking and sighed.\n\nThe Puerto Rican Amazon is Puerto Rico's only remaining native parrot and is one of roughly 30 species of Amazon parrots found in the Americas. The red-foreheaded birds grow to nearly a foot in length, are known for their secrecy and usually mate for life, reproducing once a year.\n\nMore than 460 birds remain captive at the breeding centers in El Yunque and Rio Abajo forests, but scientists have not released any of them since Hurricane Maria. A third breeding center in a forest in the western rural town of Maricao has not operated since the storm. Scientists are now trying to determine the best way to prepare the parrots for release since there are such few birds in the wild they can interact with, and whether Puerto Rico's damaged forests can sustain them.\n\nOne proposal scientists will consider is whether to capture some of the remaining wild parrots in the Rio Abajo forest and place them into the same cage as birds that will be released into the wild, so they can learn to emulate their social behavior to ensure their survival, said Jafet Velez, a wildlife biologist with U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\nScientists are tentatively planning to release 20 birds next year in Rio Abajo.\n\nAnother proposal is to release more parrots in Maricao, which was not as heavily damaged by Maria.\n\n\"Our priority now is not reproduction...it's to start releasing them,\" Lopez said, adding that breeding centers can hold only so many parrots.\n\nBut first, scientists need to make sure the forests can offer food and safe shelter.\n\nJessica Ilse, a forest biologist at el Yunque for the U.S. Forest Service, said scientists are collecting data about the amount of fruit falling from trees and the number of leaves shed. She said the canopy still has not grown back since Maria and warned that invasive species have taken root since more sunlight now shines through. Ilse said that many of the large trees where parrots used to nest are now gone and noted that it took 14 months for El Yunque's canopy to close after Hurricane Hugo hit Puerto Rico in 1989 as a Category 3 storm.\n\nScientists also are now collecting new data on the number of predators at El Yunque, including el guaraguao, a red-tailed hawk that hunts Puerto Rico parrots. Without a canopy and proper camouflage, wild parrots have become an easy target.\n\nIlse said local and federal scientists plan to help the forest recover through planting. By the end of November, they expect to have a map detailing the most damaged areas in El Yunque and a list of tree species they can plant that are more resistant to hurricanes.\n\n\"People keep asking us, 'How long is it going to take?'\" Ilse said.\n\nBut scientists don't know, she added.\n\n\"The damage is more extensive than (hurricanes) Hugo and Georges...It's been a complete change to the ecosystem.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Venezuelan ambassador to Cuba Ali Rodriguez dies", "description": "Ali Rodriguez, an icon of Venezuela's socialist revolution who went on to serve as a diplomat in top government posts, died on Monday.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/venezuelan-ambassador-to-cuba-ali-rodriguez-dies", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-62e6f59870984b1dbd7d2dec70939763.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T05:07:29Z", "content": "CARACAS, Venezuela Ali Rodriguez, an icon of Venezuela's socialist revolution who went on to serve as a diplomat in top government posts, died on Monday.

He also defended the sharply anti-American foreign policy of the socialist governments of late President Hugo Chavez and current President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"His experience and honesty were a school for all of us,\" Maduro said on Twitter, calling Rodriguez, \"a tireless fighter\" who was \"indispensable to the revolution.\"\n\nBorn in 1937 in Venezuela's central state of Lara, Rodriguez joined guerrilla fighters as a young man inspired by the Fidel Castro-led revolution in Cuba. He earned a reputation as an expert in explosives and was given the nickname of 'Comandante Fausto.'\n\nThe revolutionary fervor in Venezuela, however, never captured mass appeal, and in the 1970s most rebel groups surrendered.\n\nAfter former Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera forged a peace pact with the rebels, Rodriguez and others were granted amnesty for crimes that included kidnappings, bomb attacks and bank robberies.\n\nIn the 1980s, Rodriguez joined the Causa R party. He eventually became a central figure in Fatherland for All \u2014 another political party that supported then-presidential candidate Chavez.\n\nLater elected to Venezuela's congress, Rodriguez made a reputation for himself as a negotiator and consensus seeker, although he was always a staunch opponent of opening up the oil sector to private investment in the 1990s.\n\nRodriguez, a lawyer who did postgraduate studies in economics, was an influence to Chavez and was appointed Minister of Energy and Mines at the beginning of Chavez's first term in 1999. A year later, he left the position to serve as secretary-general of OPEC.\n\nIn 2002, he was appointed president of PDVSA, where he failed to resolve the brooding internal conflict which led to a massive walkout. To break the strike, 18,000 employees were fired under Rodriguez's management \u2014 nearly half of the oil firm's payroll.\n\nIn the years that followed, PDVSA recuperated and became the world's fifth largest oil producer, producing more than 3 million barrels per day. But financial losses after the strike were steep, and the company never recovered its engineering talent. Production is now at its lowest point in decades.\n\nRodriguez served as president of PDVSA until November 2004, when Chavez made him foreign ambassador to Cuba.\n\nHe used the position to defend Venezuela's anti-American foreign policy amid two decades of socialist rule."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "William Sanchez", "title": "The FOX News Rundown 11/20/2018", "description": "The migrant caravan and commentary by Judge Andrew Napolitano", "url": "https://radio.foxnews.com/2018/11/20/the-fox-news-rundown-11-20-2018/", "urlToImage": "https://radio.foxnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rundown-featured.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T05:00:02Z", "content": "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.

While Trump and Kushner had a private domain name -- essentially affording them a personalized dot-com email address on the Internet -- they reportedly did not maintain their own server hardware to physically store the emails sent to it.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, Peter Mirijanian, the spokesperson for Trump's ethics lawyer Abbe Lowell, emphasized those distinctions to the Hillary Clinton email scandal that engulfed the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\"To address misinformation being peddled about Ms. Trump\u2019s personal email, she did not create a private server in her house or office, there was never classified information transmitted, the account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules,\" Mirijanian said.\n\n\"She did not create a private server in her house or office, there was never classified information transmitted ...\" \u2014 Ivanka Trump attorney Abbe Lowell, via spokesman\n\nHe added: \"When concerns were raised in the press 14 months ago, Ms. Trump reviewed and verified her email use with White House Counsel and explained the issue to congressional leaders.\" Mirijanian told the Post that Trump had used a personal account prior to being briefed on ethics rules.\n\nFORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY USED PERSONAL EMAIL TO CONDUCT FBI BUSINESS, WATCHDOG FINDS\n\nAn FBI probe found that, contrary to Clinton's repeated assertions during her run for president, the former secretary of state during the Obama administration had in fact sent classified materials using a private server she established to handle virtually all of her government business. A total of 22 of the emails Clinton held on her private server contained top secret information, and nearly 2,100 contained some form of classified information.\n\nApproximately 31,000 emails were also deleted -- and never recovered -- from Clinton's server following a congressional subpoena. Because Clinton -- and not a third party, like Gmail -- owned, operated, and maintained the server, investigators faced additional challenges in seeking to recover that data.\n\nDespite the distinctions between Clinton's email practices and Trump's, the Post reported late Monday that administration officials were \"alarmed.\" The paper quoted Austin Evers, the executive director of a liberal advocacy group, accusing the White House of \"obvious hypocrisy.\"\n\nSTATE DEPT USED 'CLEARLY FALSE' AFFIDAVITS TO DERAIL DOC REQUESTS IN EMAIL PROBE, 'SHOCKED' FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS\n\nThe Presidential Records Act requires that all official communication by White House officials be archived, and Mirijanian said Trump already turned over all such communications from her personal account months ago for that purpose.\n\nThe Post acknowledged later in its story that Trump's actions \"could have\" broken that law, after initially citing officials as saying that she had in fact violated federal rules.\n\nMirijanian explained that Trump used her personal account \"almost always\" for logistics matters, as opposed to more sensitive information that could implicate other federal laws.\n\n\u201cLike most people, before entering into government service, Ms. Trump used a private email,\" he said. \"When she entered the government, she was given a government email account for official use. While transitioning into government, until the White House provided her the same guidance they had to others who started before she did, Ms. Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family.\"\n\n\n\nHOUSE INVESTIGATORS DEMAND INFORMATION ON TRUMP OFFICIALS' EMAIL USE\n\nWhite House officials have been aware since shortly after the beginning of the administration that Trump and Kushner had used private email accounts.\n\n\u201cThe White House instructs staff to fully comply with the Presidential Records Act, and briefed staff on the need to preserve records,\u201d a senior official told Fox News late last year.\n\nKushner used personal email in his first few months of the administration, Lowell confirmed to Fox News at the time. He said the emails usually involved news articles and political commentary. Lowell also said any non-personal emails were forwarded to Kushner's official account and \"all have been preserved in any event.\"\n\nFormer Chief White House Strategist Steve Bannon, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, former Chief White House economic advisor Gary Cohn, and Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller were also reported to have used private accounts at one point during the administration, The New York Times reported.\n\nAnd former FBI Director James Comey used a personal email account to \"conduct unclassified FBI business,\" the Justice Department's watchdog revealed in an explosive report on the bureau's conduct in the Clinton email investigation earlier this year.\n\nDOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote that he found Comey's use of personal email to be \"inconsistent with Department policy,\" citing what he called \"the absence of exigent circumstances and the frequency with which the use of personal email occurred.\"\n\nHorowitz also revealed that FBI agent Peter Strzok used his personal email account for government business. Most notably, Horowitz wrote that Strzok forwarded an email to his personal account regarding a proposed search warrant for former Congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop computer. Horowitz wrote that the email on Strzok's personal account contained information \"that appears to have been under seal at the time\" in federal court.\n\nStrzok was removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation last year after Horowitz's office discovered anti-Trump text messages between him and FBI lawyer Lisa Page.\n\nFox News' Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Frank Miles", "title": "Cops seek gunman on the loose after sexual assault, shooting in Catholic store in suburban St. Louis - Fox News", "description": "Cops seek gunman on the loose after sexual assault, shooting in Catholic store in suburban St. Louis Fox News Police in suburban St. Louis is searching for a gunman who went into a religious supply store, sexually assaulted at least one woman and shot a woman\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/cops-seeking-gunman-on-the-loose-after-sexual-assault-shooting-in-catholic-store-in-suburban-st-louis", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Catholic-Supply-at-14069-Manchester-Road.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:50:57Z", "content": "A gunman who went into a Catholic supply store in suburban St. Louis, sexually assaulted at least one woman and shot a woman in the head is being sought by police Monday night.

The brother claimed afterward that Guzman made it clear he wanted Fuentes dead, and ended up ordering his killing.\n\nAlso assassinated were a corrupt police commander in 2008 for telling people \"that he was going to finish off [Zambada's] brother and Chapo,\" and another drug dealer who was struck down by \"a hail of bullets from [an] AK-47\" that nearly took off his head, the witness said.\n\nAs Zambada talked, jurors were shown a picture of a diamond-encrusted .38-caliber pistol decorated with Guzman's initials -- \"JGL\" for Joaquin Guzman Loera. Zambada also testified that Guzman would carry several firearms at once, including AK-47s, AR-15s, and bazookas.\n\nZambada described being told by one of his paid informants within law enforcement that authorities were close to capturing Guzman, who was hiding in the mountains of Mexico's Sinaloa state after his first escape from prison in 2001. It was suggested that the cartel should give a $250,000 bribe to a ranking officer, after which, \"The operation was aborted. There was no problem,\" he said. In another instance, Zambada said he was told to pay $100,000 to a Mexican general.\n\nThe defense has argued that cooperators like Zambada are framing Guzman to win favor from the court in their own criminal cases. On cross-examination Monday, the defense sought to suggest Zambada was minimizing his own role in the cartel and exaggerating that of Guzman as a mythical kingpin when really they say he was in hiding most of his life of crime and not calling the shots.\n\nDefense attorney William Purpura asked Zambada how it was possible Guzman outranked him when there was evidence Guzman needed to buy his supply of cocaine from Zambada. For emphasis, the lawyer pulled down Zambada's mugshot from a lower portion of a cartel organizational chart on display in the courtroom and held it above one of Guzman.\n\n\"How does that look?\" the lawyer asked.\n\n\"Fine,\" the witness said with a smirk before quickly qualifying the answer by adding, \"I'm below him.\"\n\nThroughout the day, Guzman took every opportunity possible to seek out his wife, 29-year-old Emma Coronel Aispuro, for waves and smiles. The one-time beauty queen has been a regular presence in court, though the judge in the case denied Guzman's request to \"hug his wife\" earlier this month.\n\nAt one point during Zambada's testimony, Aispuro leaned over in her seat with her head in her hands out of apparent exasperation.\n\nGuzman, who was extradited to New York City early last year, has pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking charges. If convicted, he would face a possible life term.\n\nFox News' Marta Dhanis and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}]
