Two other sources with knowledge of the discussion didn't go so far as to describe the crown prince as angry, though they didn't deny he was annoyed.\n\nPutting it into more carefully diplomatic terms, one said, \"He didn't like the idea.\" According to the other source, the Saudis \"have their reservations,\" but the source said it remained a courteous discussion.\n\nAs part of a British effort to draft a Security Council resolution against the continued fighting and humanitarian crisis in Yemen, Hunt flew to Riyadh this week to sit down with bin Salman, who has faced intense criticism and scrutiny over the brazen killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in early October at the hands of officials in his inner circle.\n\n'What is your plan?'\n\nSources say Hunt took the draft with him and discussed it with the crown prince, who wanted changes or better yet, no resolution at all. Bin Salman, known in diplomatic circles by his initials, MBS, viewed the pending resolution as weakening the Saudi position in the conflict over Yemen and emboldening its Houthi rebel rivals.\n\n\"MBS didn't like the resolution on principle,\" said a source familiar with the Riyadh meeting.\n\nBut the message Hunt delivered was a strong one, a fourth source said, and came after he'd consulted with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. \"'This is what Western powers think, and this is what you need to do. What is your plan to stop this?'\" Hunt conveyed to the Saudi, according to this source, who added, \"He heard what we said.\"\n\nIn what's seen as a positive move, the Saudis have now agreed to facilitate Houthi negotiators' travel to Sweden for talks.\n\nJUST WATCHED Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies 02:52\n\nHunt left with the understanding that he would work on changes to the resolution with his team, as well as with his counterparts in the US and elsewhere. These allies share concerns that a bad reaction from Saudi Arabia to a strongly worded UN resolution could set back the start of a process to resolve the war in Yemen.\n\nEven so, one of the sources familiar with the Riyadh meeting said Western allies \"are not inclined to act on all of MBS's recommendations.\"\n\nAt a Security Council meeting on Friday, British Ambassador Karen Pierce said the UK would introduce the new resolution on Monday.\n\nThe Department of State and Saudi Arabian Embassy in the US did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe encounter puts in stark light the efforts of the UK, US and other allies to hold the kingdom's leadership accountable for serious alleged human rights violations, while still maintaining good working relationships with Saudi Arabia in the volatile region.\n\nThe US and UK were the top two arms sellers to Riyadh in 2017, with $5.2 billion and $1.2 billion in sales, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nBabies like ghosts\n\nHunt's meeting with the crown prince also underscores bin Salman's resistance to pressure on Yemen, which has become the world's worst man-made humanitarian disaster, as babies, children and adults slowly starve to death.\n\nThe three-year conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and its enemies, Iran-backed Houthis, has devastated the country and killed at least 10,000 people. UN experts say the Saudi coalition's bombings of civilians are potential war crimes . The world body has also said the Saudis' partial blockade of the country means 18 million people don't have reliable access to food, creating the conditions for the worst famine in 100 years.\n\nThe World Food Program warned Friday that the country is \"marching to the brink of starvation.\" Its executive director, David Beasley, who just returned from Yemen, told reporters he touched babies who felt like \"ghosts\" due to starvation.\n\nThe UK's willingness to make changes to the resolution to ease Saudi concerns drew sharp criticism from human rights advocates.\n\nBritish NGO Save the Children warns that millions of children are at risk of famine in the war in Yemen.\n\n\"The Saudi sway over some members of the UN Security Council has become a serious liability,\" said Akshaya Kumar, the deputy United Nations director for Human Rights Watch. The UK for months has resisted bringing a UN resolution on Yemen and the US has been loath to criticize Riyadh for the destruction there.\n\n\"It's absolutely mind-boggling that the world's most powerful body has chosen silence for months even as warnings of famine have mounted,\" Kumar said. \"At this point, vague appeals to 'all parties' to improve their behavior won't work. Any resolution that doesn't specifically mention the Saudi-led coalition by name and call it out for its role in the carnage in Yemen won't have the required effect in Riyadh.\"\n\nIn an effort to win an edge in any negotiations, Saudi Arabia has repeatedly tried to gain a definitive military edge before agreeing to talks. Khashoggi's killing, tied to bin Salman's inner circle, put Saudi Arabia on the defensive diplomatically, giving the US and UK an opening to press Riyadh.\n\nIn late October, US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Pompeo called on all participants in the civil war to agree to a ceasefire \"in the next 30 days,\" amid criticism of US support for the Saudi-led coalition in the conflict. The administration will likely face greater pressure to restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia and act on Yemen now that midterm elections have given Democrats control of the House of Representatives.\n\nJUST WATCHED Shrapnel ties US-made bombs to Yemen deaths Replay More Videos ...

The Foreign Secretary had constructive discussions on pathways to achieve de-escalation and reduce tensions, and was clear that both sides would need to play their part in the confidence-building measures.\"\n\nThe fourth source familiar with Hunt's discussions said the foreign secretary was in the region \"to talk about a full sweep of issues in relation to Yemen\" and as a result, also visited the UAE, a core member of the Saudi coalition.\n\nHunt also spoke to the Saudi crown prince about the country's standoff with Qatar and about the need for accountability in Khashoggi's killing. On Thursday, the Saudi Public Prosecutor's Office charged 11 people and sentenced five to death for the Virginia resident's killing.\n\nOne source with knowledge of the discussion between Hunt and the crown prince told CNN that such a meeting, between a British foreign secretary and the Saudi de facto head of state, is unusual; that based on diplomatic protocols, the foreign secretary would normally meet with a lower-level counterpart to talk over a pending action.\n\n'Reality on the ground'\n\nThe fourth source familiar with Hunt's meeting said the Saudis \"have their reservations\" about the resolution, \"but it's a tool to get both sides to come to the table. And it does need to reflect the reality on the ground.\"\n\nOne source with knowledge of discussions says the US has not been shying away from supporting the resolution, and that US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has been enthusiastic about getting something done.\n\nThe source said others in the US administration don't seem to be as willing as Haley to forcefully call out Saudi Arabia in this way.\n\nBut MBS's serious pushback to a potential statement by the UN Security Council -- merely a resolution calling for humanitarian aid and stopping the fighting -- also shows that such moves have an impact at the highest level of Saudi government.\n\n\"The Saudis are hugely sensitive -- ultra, ultra sensitive -- to international perceptions,\" a diplomatic source told CNN. \"They hate criticism. And MBS brings a whole new level of paranoia about this.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "macamilarincon", "title": "Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador: su biograf\u00eda en datos clave", "description": "Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador ser\u00e1 presidente de M\u00e9xico el pr\u00f3ximo 1 de diciembre, cuando tome posesi\u00f3n del cargo.

Someone spray-painted an anarchy symbol on the driveway. The protest has been widely condemned by many members of the media, including multiple anchors at CNN.\n\nBut one detail from the November 7 disturbance has come under scrutiny. Carlson told the Washington Post that \"someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door.\"\n\nLiberal critics of Carlson have cast doubt on that claim by saying there was no evidence of damage to the door. They have accused him of lying and exaggerating to score political points. So CNN contacted the D.C. police and asked about the door. The police report about the incident did not mention any damage on the door. Was there any sign that it was cracked, as Carlson claimed?\n\nA police spokeswoman responded, \"MPD did not observe any visible damage to the front door of the victim's house the night of the incident.\"\n\nIt is still possible that the door was cracked. And there is no doubt that the overall incident was disturbing to the Carlsons. While Tucker was at work when the activists showed up, his wife Susan was home alone. She called the police when she heard \"loud banging and pounding on her front door,\" according to the police report.\n\nIn videos uploaded to Twitter by the group, which calls itself an \"anti-fascist\" or Antifa group in DC, last Wednesday, protesters were heard saying \"Tucker Carlson, we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!\" They called him a \"racist scumbag\" and hurled epithets.\n\nThe police, speaking of the incident, said \"a group of protesters broke the law by defacing private property.\"\n\nBut the disputed detail about the door has come up several times. Carlson's friend and business partner Neil Patel repeated the description on CNN's \"Reliable Sources\" last weekend.\n\n\"People start pounding on her door and throwing themselves at the door to the point where the door actually cracked,\" he said.\n\nPresident Trump talked about it in a Wednesday interview with the conservative site The Daily Caller, which Carlson and Patel co-founded.\n\nThe interviewer said: \"They cracked the door \u2014 what is this violence? Where does it come from? Do you have a message for Tucker and his family?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Trump said, \"I spoke to Tucker and I think Tucker's a great guy and I think it's terrible, they were actually trying to break down the door.\"\n\nThe group defended its decision to show up at Carlson's home. They believe Carlson supports and promotes a white nationalist agenda on Fox News, a charge Carlson denies.\n\nAfter many journalists and commentators came to Carlson's defense last week, arguing that a person's family and home should not be targeted, some of Carlson's detractors pushed back by pointing to discrepancies in the accounts.\n\nAlan Pyke, a reporter for the liberal site ThinkProgress, wrote a first-person account of the protest and said one protester knocked firmly on Carlson's front door \"three times,\" but then rejoined the rest of the group in the street. \"This person did not throw their body against the door, as Carlson has claimed to newspapers,\" Pyke wrote.\n\nCarlson's critics said he should provide a picture of the crack.\n\nCarlson did not respond to CNN's specific questions about that.\n\nSo, the Washington Post's Erik Wemple wrote Thursday, \"the search for corroborating evidence continues.\" He noted that when he visited Carlson's home with a colleague one day after the disturbance, the door \"seemed sturdy and fully intact. A woman who answered a knock looked it up and down and appeared to conclude it was in fine shape. It appeared to close snugly.\"\n\nCarlson responded angrily to Wemple's inquiries. And he responded angrily when contacted by CNN about the police's statement that officers did not observe any visible damage to the door.\n\n\"CNN has repeatedly defended Antifa, and you are doing it again now,\" he said in a statement through Fox News. \"Your story is a disgusting attempt to minimize an attack on my family and bring more pain to my wife and four children. I'm not playing along. I hope you're ashamed of yourself. You should be.\"\n\nFor the record, I said on last week's \"Reliable Sources\" that \"it is absolutely inappropriate and unacceptable for protesters to show up at his own home to try to make him feel threatened where he lives.\"\n\nThe D.C. police said last week that they are investigating the incident, given the defacing of private property that occurred.\n\nOn Thursday, the MPD spokeswoman said \"there is no further information to provide as this case remains under investigation.

The case is Barry Michaels v. Whitaker, which was automatically renamed from Michaels v.

Three drugs will increase 3%, while one will go up by 9%. The medications represent 10% of Pfizer's drug portfolio.\n\nThe drugmaker surprised manyin Julywith its decision to walk back hikes after Trump tweeted that the company should be \"ashamed\" of itself for raising prices and taking advantage of the poor. The next day, the president tweeted that he had spoken personally to Pfizer's CEO, who agreed to roll back the increases.\n\nTrump has made lowering drug prices a main focus of his first term. In May, his administration rolled out a 44-page \"blueprint\" for increasing competition, reducing regulations and changing the incentives for all players in the drug industry. Last month, Trump outlined a plan to revamp how Medicare pays for certain high-cost drugs by basing reimbursements on the prices paid in other countries.\n\nBut Pfizer made clear all along that the deferralwould be temporary -- lasting only until the end of the year or until Trump's blueprint went into effect, whichever came sooner.\n\nPfizer noted Friday that the increases will be offset by higher rebates and discounts offered to insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, which administer drug programs for employers, federal and state governments and other clients. It said it expects these players to share those benefits with patients so their costs don't go up.\n\n\"We believe the best means to address affordability of medicines is to reduce the growing out-of-pocket costs that consumers are facing due to high deductibles and co-insurance, and ensure that patients receive the benefit of rebates at the pharmacy counter,\" Ian Read, Pfizer's chief executive officer, said in a statement.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Department of Health & Human Services said that its secretary, Alex Azar, and Trump \"will continue to take bold action to restructure this broken market.\"\n\n\"Actions announced today on list prices further illustrate the perverse incentives of America's drug pricing system,\" said Caitlin Oakley, an agency spokeswoman. \"Drug companies raising their prices and offsetting them with higher rebates benefits everyone but the consumer, who routinely pays out of pocket based on list price.\"\n\nPfizer's price increases are \"not egregious\" and may serve as a trial balloon to gauge the administration's response, said David Maris, senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.\n\n\"However, given how public the previous rebuke was, we think this [will] enflame the debate around drug pricing,\" Maris said, \"especially since it comes less than two weeks following an election that resulted in Democrat control of the House with many having run on drug-price-controls/Medicare-for-All platforms.\"\n\nWhile a few other companies, such as Novartis and Merck , also agreed over the summer to freeze prices on certain drugs, many manufacturers continued to hike them. Drugmakers increased the cost of 104 medications in June and the first two days of July, only weeks after the administration unveiled its blueprint, according to a Wells Fargo Securities report. Manufacturers typically raise prices at the start and in the middle of the year.\n\nCongress is expected to continue its focus on reducing drug prices next year, and it's one of the few areas of common ground between the parties. Both Trump and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who is vying to reclaim her post as House speaker, mentioned it the day after the midterm elections last week."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Matt McFarland, CNN Business", "title": "Lime is under fire over broken scooters", "description": "The scooter-sharing startup Lime continues to clash with its suppliers amid questions about the safety of its scooters.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/tech/lime-scooter-supplier/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181030211728-02-lime-scooter-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:56:45Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Washington, DC (CNN) The scooter-sharing startup Lime continues to clash with its suppliers amid questions about the safety of its scooters.\n\nChinese company Okai is pushing back on claims that it's the source of flawed Lime scooters.\n\nEarlier this month, Lime said it removed all of its scooters manufactured by Okai following reports that the baseboard where users stand can snap in half and endanger riders.Some riders have suffered injuries, and an Okai scooter may have contributed to a fatality. Lime uses scooters from multiple manufacturers, but doesn't reveal exactly how many.\n\nIn late October, Lime stated the baseboard on its Okai models could break if ridden off a curb at high speeds.\n\nOkai said Friday Lime's claims are \"groundless\" and the faulty scooters come from another supplier.\n\n\"We feel it necessary to make cautions to the public on the credibility of such statements made by Lime,\" Okai said in a statement sent to CNN Business on Friday. \"Obviously, Lime has other suppliers whose scooters broke.\"\n\nLime declined to comment on whether it has recalled scooters from other manufacturers.\n\nnot all looked the same. The Okai model has a distinct set of lights and screws, the manufacturer said in its statement. Photos on social media and in news reports revealed Lime scooters with broken floorboards -- some of which match images of the scooter model Okai says it provided to Lime. Butnot all looked the same. The Okai model has a distinct set of lights and screws, the manufacturer said in its statement.\n\nOkai said it sold 32,000 scooters to Lime, but the company has not revealed how many scooters it has removed from streets. When it recalled some scooters over battery concerns earlier this year, the issue impacted less than 0.01% of its fleet, Lime said.\n\nThe company said it is working with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission to investigate its Okai scooters.\n\nIn 2017, Lime launched as LimeBike, a dockless bikesharing startup. But this year it shifted its focus to scooters after Bird, a Santa Monica startup, pioneered a popular scooter-sharing service. Lime has since raised hundreds of millions of dollars, including from Uber. Lime operates in 10 countries and more than 85 US cities.\n\nScooters have been shown to reduce car trips, earning praise from environmentalists and city experts. But safety questions have followed the company's rapid expansion. In September, a Dallas man died shortly after a crash while riding a Lime scooter. Police discovered the scooter was broken in half, but the company hasn't said if the man was riding an Okai scooter.\n\nThis photo, taken in October, shows several scooter models that Lime previously available in Washington DC. Okai says the scooter on the far left, and second from the right, isn't its scooter.\n\nAlong with fellow Lime supplier Ninebot, Okai is calling on scooter companies to do more to protect scooters from the wear-and-tear of daily use.\n\n\"It is the operator's responsibility to ensure proper and prompt management and maintenance of the scooters it puts into the co-sharing market,\" Okai said.\n\nLime has already taken some steps to tackle safety concerns. It announced a $3 million program to distribute 250,000 helmets and educate riders on safety practices. Lime recently unveiled a new scooter with safety improvements, such as larger wheels, intended to better handle potholes and uneven roads.\n\nCompanies are racing to meet demand and expand to new cities.\n\nBut the Silicon Valley-backed companies have grown at a breakneck pace , which has drawn criticism for introducing problems at a scale that wouldn't occur with steadier growth. Some view scooters as clutter because they're sometimes parked incorrectly, such as blocking sidewalks.\n\nAccording to Tony Ho, vice president of business development at the Chinese company Ninebot, which makes a majority of the shared scooters in use worldwide, the scooter-sharing industry is so new that issues continue to pop up.\n\nHe said Ninebot plans to release a new model later this year that's better designed for harsh conditions. Shared scooters are typically ridden a half-dozen times a day on roads of varying quality, and in inclement weather. Scooters are often thrown to the ground, or tossed in the back of trucks to be charged. And minor cracks can expose components, leading to malfunctions.\n\n\"There's room to improve in how to operate, and how to train chargers,\" Ho said of the scooter-sharing startups. \"This is almost like a new test for us. The product needs to sustain a real industrial type of environment.\"\n\nSegway is also shifting the battery in its scooters to the baseboard. This will lower the center of gravity, making them less likely to tip over and expose riders to head injuries.\n\n\"It's gonna be a beast,\" Ho said of the new scooter."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Sophie Tatum and Ariane de Vogue, CNN", "title": "Supreme Court to hear case related to census citizenship question", "description": "The US Supreme Court said on Friday that it will take up a case related to the decision to include a question about citizenship on the next census.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/politics/supreme-court-citizenship-question-census/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161206091607-01-scotus-building-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:54:25Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) The US Supreme Court said on Friday that it will take up a case related to the decision to include a question about citizenship on the next census.\n\nThe justices will review whether challengers can introduce evidence outside of the official record, beyond what the government based its decision on, including the testimony of a senior Justice Department official.\n\nA key issue in the case is whether challengers can depose Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has jurisdiction over the census.\n\nThe court last month temporarily blocked Ross from having to face a deposition on the issue, which was seen as a partial win for the Trump administration.\n\nThe administration argued that such a deposition of a Cabinet official is \"rarely, if ever justified.\" However, at the time the court allowed the deposition of acting Assistant Attorney General John M.

It comes as Pelosi is shoring up support from the progressive base this week with endorsements from large and powerful groups, as well as prominent progressives in Congress \u2014 a move that will put pressure on wayward Democrats to back her bid.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a co-chair of the progressive caucus along with Rep. Mark Pocan, earlier this week would not say whom she's supporting, but she is listed on the women's letter in support of Pelosi.\n\nAlso on the letter are members-elect like Angie Craig of Minnesota, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Dr. Kim Schrier of Washington state, Lori Trahan of Massachusetts, and Jennifer Wexton of Virginia.\n\nBelow are all the freshmen on the list:\n\nAngie Craig of Minnesota\n\nMadeleine Dean of Pennsylvania\n\nSylvia Garcia of Texas\n\nKatie Hill of California\n\nAnn Kirkpatrick of Arizona\n\nVeronica Escobar of Texas\n\nDeb Haaland of New Mexico\n\nIlhan Omar of Minnesota\n\nKim Schrier of Washington\n\nDonna Shalala of Florida\n\nLori Trahan of Massachusetts\n\nDebbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida\n\nJennifer Wexton of Virginia\n\nNotably absent from the list are progressive incoming freshmen like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jahana Hayes of Connecticut. Ocasio-Cortez told Vice News this week she was open to supporting Pelosi.\n\nThe letter reads: \"Now that we are faced with unprecedented threats to our democracy, women, minorities, and even the most basic American values by President Trump, we need your effective leadership more than ever to advance our efforts to help hard-working families get ahead.\"\n\nThe letter, managed by Rep. Nita Lowey, includes 48 incumbent women members, almost all of whom are widely known as Pelosi supporters. Pelosi has a large whip team of 45 members working to nail down additional statements of support. Since the midterm elections, her office has been blasting multiple statements and endorsements daily, showing strong signs of support especially among likely committee chairs.\n\nFollowing the Congressional Progressive Caucus meeting on Thursday, the caucus issued a statement saying Pelosi will ensure that members of the CPC will have seats on some of the most powerful committees in Congress, and that she may create more elected leadership positions that CPC members can run for in the broader Democratic caucus.\n\nIt's unclear yet what effect the support and endorsements by progressives will have on some of the members and incoming freshmen who have already vowed to oppose Pelosi. Most of them hail from moderate districts, including several incoming freshmen who flipped their district for Democrats while campaigning to not support Pelosi.\n\nThere's little doubt that Pelosi will lock up the nomination -- which she can win with only a majority of the caucus --when Democrats votes on November 28, but it's not certain if she'll win the 218 votes she needs in January for the House floor vote. That's because 18 Democrats have promised not to vote for Pelosi on the House floor, a number that threatens Pelosi's speaker chances if they all hold to to their commitments. Rep. Marcia Fudge is openly weighing a bid to run against Pelosi.\n\nA \"Dear Colleague\" letter passed around by members of the House Democratic caucus dissatisfied with Pelosi says \"we believe more strongly than ever that the time has come for new leadership in our Caucus,\" according to a copy obtained by CNN.\n\nAlong with the progressive caucus, Pelosi has also met with moderate groups this week, like the Blue Dog Coalition and the Problem Solvers Caucus.

Nacido en 1929, Brasilier fue criado en Saumur, en el oeste de Francia, rodeado de belleza natural, y esos primeros recuerdos han permanecido con \u00e9l a largo de su vida.\n\n\"Los caballos fueron mis primeros modelos mientras viv\u00eda en el campo con mis padres\", dijo Brasilier, quien gan\u00f3 el codiciado Gran Premio de Roma a los 23 a\u00f1os.\n\n\"As\u00ed que mis primeros modelos fueron los caballos que araban los campos\", agrega. \"Desde una edad muy temprana, me atrajo la belleza de esos animales\".\n\nEl valor del arte de Brasilier ha aumentado un 557% durante los \u00faltimos cinco a\u00f1os, un salto que se refleja en la cantidad de piezas vendidas en subastas.\n\nSi bien Brasilier lleva la creatividad en su ADN -sus dos padres fueron artistas-, \u00e9l fue el \u00fanico de los cinco hermanos que se inclin\u00f3 por una profesi\u00f3n art\u00edstica.\n\nMIRA: Un diamante rosa se convierte en el m\u00e1s caro jam\u00e1s subastado\n\n\"Nac\u00ed en una familia dedicada al arte\", dijo, y agreg\u00f3 que supo que quer\u00eda pintar a los 10 a\u00f1os.\n\n\"Est\u00e1n cargados de simbolismo\"\n\nAdem\u00e1s de artista, Brasilier dice que su padre ten\u00eda devoci\u00f3n religiosa.\n\n\"Nac\u00ed en un entorno espiritual. Mi padre estaba dedicado al arte religioso hasta el punto de no firmar sus obras\", explic\u00f3. Como expresionista, Brasilier est\u00e1 fascinado por lo que representan los caballos en t\u00e9rminos religiosos, no solamente su belleza f\u00edsica.\n\n\"Los caballos son una creaci\u00f3n estupenda.

Lo que me interesa es esta b\u00fasqueda de la belleza.\"\n\n\"Un s\u00edmbolo de divinidad\"\n\nBrasilier sonr\u00ede al hablar de su propio caballo, \"Foufou\", que guarda en su casa de campo en Francia.\n\nA \u00e9l le atribuye el m\u00e9rito de refrescar su mirada de la vida, que combina una actitud l\u00fadica con sentido del humor y agudeza de ingenio.\n\n\"Cada vez que veo un caballo me siento inspirado.

Jones, quien tiene un doctorado en ciencias cognitivas, escribe en Equus Magazine que los detalles que los humanos pueden ver a una distancia de 9 metros, un caballo apenas la ve a 6 metros.\n\n\"El caballo tiene que estar un 50% m\u00e1s cerca para ver los mismos detalles\", dice. \"Un 50% de deficiencia es suficiente para que lo considere cualquier jinete. Hasta cuando hay sol, la visi\u00f3n de un salto para el caballo es borrosa, neblinosa, t\u00e9nue, vaga, todos los adjetivos en los que usted preferir\u00eda no pensar cuando galopa a 9 metros por segundo hacia un gran obst\u00e1culo que podr\u00eda arruinarle el d\u00eda\".\n\nLos investigadores de la Universidad de Exeter experimentaron cambiando el color de los obst\u00e1culos a blanco y amarillo.\n\nSi bien esto no significa necesariamente que los caballos pueden ver mejor las vallas, los animales saltaron de otro modo frente a los distintos colores.\n\nLos investigadores esperan que este estudio, realizado en colaboraci\u00f3n con la Autoridad Brit\u00e1nica de Carreras de Equitaci\u00f3n y la RSPCA, mejore el bienestar y la seguridad de los caballos y de sus jinetes al reducir el riesgo de ca\u00eddas y heridas.\n\nStevens explica que los caballos s\u00f3lo tienen dos tipos de conos en sus ojos, comparados con los humanos, que tienen tres.\n\n\"B\u00e1sicamente esto significa que solo pueden ver los colores que percibimos como azules y amarillos y no pueden ver la diferencia entre los rojos y los verdes\", se\u00f1ala Stevens.\n\nEntonces los investigadores compararon los marcadores naranja usados en las pistas h\u00edpicas con una selecci\u00f3n m\u00e1s amplia de colores alternativos.\n\n\"Tomamos algunos de esos colores que podr\u00edan ser m\u00e1s visibles. Hicimos pruebas conductuales durante el entrenamiento de los caballos para ver c\u00f3mo los afectaban otros colores en los saltos\", explica Stevens.\n\nLas fotograf\u00edas, una ayuda para convencer al sector de hacer cambios\n\nUsando una c\u00e1mara que puede interpretar ciertas longitudes de onda de luz, los investigadores pudieron transformar las fotograf\u00edas para ilustrar c\u00f3mo podr\u00eda ver los colores un caballo en un ambiente en particular.\n\n\"Hacemos comparaci\u00f3n en t\u00e9rminos de cu\u00e1n visibles son los colores en contraste con distintos fondos, por ejemplo c\u00f3mo una tabla de despegue se ve contra el c\u00e9sped al frente, cu\u00e1n visible es una barra naranja con una valla de fondo y contrastes similares\", agreg\u00f3 Stevens.\n\n\"As\u00ed podemos empezar a cuantificar realmente cu\u00e1n visibles deber\u00edan ser esas cosas para un caballo.\"\n\nEl color naranja se usa desde hace bastante tiempo en las carreras \u2013en gran parte para beneficio humano\u2013, y si bien Stevens dice que la comunidad cient\u00edfica sabe qu\u00e9 colores puden ver o no los caballos, ninguna investigaci\u00f3n lo hab\u00eda cuantificado en las carreras.\n\n\"Creo que a veces no siempre existe una correspondencia entre lo que sabe la literatura cient\u00edfica y lo que se sabe fuera de la ciencia\", dice. \"No hab\u00eda habido ning\u00fan trabajo que cuantificara realmente cu\u00e1n visibles ser\u00edan los marcadores naranja para un caballo\".\n\nDavid Sykes, director de Salud y Bienestar Equino de la Autoridad de Carreras H\u00edpicas Brit\u00e1nica, dijo que la investigaci\u00f3n brind\u00f3 una demostraci\u00f3n fotogr\u00e1fica de las diferencias significativas entre lo que ven los caballos y los humanos.\n\n\"Han podido hacer esto y realmente nos han convencido y han validado que eso es exactamente lo que ve el caballo y lo que usted o yo vemos. Veo que la diferencia es sustancial\", le dijo Sykes a CNN.\n\nLa investigaci\u00f3n es un paso hacia adelante para mejorar el bienestar de los caballos durante las carreras, dice Roly Owers, presidente ejecutivo de World Horse Welfare.\n\n\"Nuestro entendimiento de la visi\u00f3n equina est\u00e1 continuamente en desarrollo, pero a menudo no se tiene en cuenta lo suficiente\", le dijo Owers a CNN en una declaraci\u00f3n.\n\n\"Por lo tanto, World Horse Welfare ve con benepl\u00e1cito la prueba experimental del British Horseracing Authority (BHA) sobre un nuevo dise\u00f1o de vallas y obst\u00e1culos. Es esencial que el mundo de las carreras de caballos reduzca el riesgo al bienestar y a la seguridad lo m\u00e1s posible.\n\n\"Esperamos que, al definir mejor los bordes y los obst\u00e1culos, los riesgos de ca\u00eddas y muertes sean reducidas a\u00fan m\u00e1s.\"\n\nM\u00e1s pruebas antes de ponerlos en pr\u00e1ctica en los hip\u00f3dromos.\n\nSykes dice que el BHA verificar\u00e1 los hallazgos de la Universidad de Exeter de manera independiente.\n\nEl BHA pondr\u00e1 en pr\u00e1ctica los cambios de color en algunos centros de entrenamiento y recopilar\u00e1 comentarios de entrenadores y jinetes. Si queda claro que los caballos se sienten m\u00e1s seguros y respetuosos de las vallas y saltan mejor y con m\u00e1s claridad, entonces la BHA ver\u00e1 si los pone en pr\u00e1ctica en otros hip\u00f3dromos.\n\n\"Lo que estar\u00edamos haciendo entonces es recopilar informaci\u00f3n y preguntarnos cu\u00e1l ha sido hist\u00f3ricamente el porcentaje de ca\u00eddas en las pistas. Lo hemos puesto en pr\u00e1ctica, as\u00ed que a partir de ahora mediremos el porcentaje de ca\u00eddas y lesiones\", explica Sykes.\n\n\"Obviamente si la informaci\u00f3n que recopilemos indica un gran cambio, pondremos en pr\u00e1ctica las sugerencias lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido posible.\"\n\n\"Pero si la evidencia dice que la disminuci\u00f3n de los porcentajes es menor, entonces quiz\u00e1s seamos un poco m\u00e1s cautelosos en la puesta en pr\u00e1ctica.\"\n\nDesde el a\u00f1o 2004, el \u00edndice de ca\u00edda en carreras brit\u00e1nicas ha sido reducido en un 29%. Seg\u00fan el BHA es el \"resultado de una inversi\u00f3n continua en la seguridad de las pistas y mejoras constantes en el cuidado de caballos de carreras y est\u00e1ndares de entrenamiento\".\n\nParece que las pruebas preliminares llevadas cabo por Stevens ya han demostrado ser un \u00e9xito. Los jinetes han reportado mejoras notables en el compartamiento de los caballos.\n\n\"Al saltar sobre vallas de distintos colores, not\u00e9 claramente que, al pasar por encima de algunos colores, los caballos reaccionaban de manera distinta y mostraban m\u00e1s respeto por el obst\u00e1culo\", dijo el exjinete en una declaraci\u00f3n.\n\n\"Estoy seguro de que otros jinetes se sentir\u00e1n igual, y parece ser una excelente idea y oportunidad para hacer que el deporte sea m\u00e1s seguro, tanto para los caballos como para los jinetes\"."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Melissa Vel\u00e1squez Loaiza", "title": "El Birdcage de la Copa Melbourne, el lugar donde los invitados especiales comen hormigas y beben champa\u00f1a espacial", "description": "Ricos y famosos se encontrar\u00e1n el d\u00eda de la carrera m\u00e1s prestigiosa de Australia en el Hip\u00f3dromo de Flemington.

He called the situation \"an air quality emergency,\" and experts said the smoke could undo decades of progress on pollution.\n\n\"We have made tremendous efforts and investment to clean up our air with considerable benefits for public health,\" said Dr. Daniel Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University. \"But now it's like we're getting stabbed in the back with those wildfires.\"\n\nSome call cancellations 'too little, too late'\n\nSan Francisco's transit agency has taken its cable cars off the streets , several schools have canceled classes, and the National Park service suspended tours to Alcatraz Island.\n\nPublic schools in San Francisco and Alameda County were closed Friday, along with UC Davis and UC Merced. UC Berkeley also canceled Friday's classes, but some students criticized the university's decision to stay open Thursday as smoke descended on the campus.\n\nThe school's student association wrote a letter to their chancellor denouncing the \"administration's insufficient response to these public health risks\" and urging administrators to allocate emergency funds for masks and mobile air filtration units.\n\n\"Campus buildings are not equipped to filter out the pollutants making the air indoors just as harmful as it is outside,\" the group wrote. Some students, even those without pre-existing conditions, said they felt sick.\n\n\"I had a bloody throat, bloody nose, a cough, dry and watering eyes, and my throat is still very sore and dry,\" freshman Sabrina Thorn said. \"I almost passed out trying to go to class yesterday. My professor told me to go home.\"\n\nStudents struggle to find respirators\n\nThorn's sorority sister gave her a mask, but freshman Samantha Greene said that other students have struggled to find them. That's because the university's health service is not distributing them to all students -- just those with medical conditions like asthma.\n\n\"There are over 40,000 students at the university,\" spokesman Dan Mogulof said, \"and we just don't have access to masks of that number.\"\n\nSome students, though, still think the school needs to be doing more.\n\nStudents at the University of California, Berkeley wait for respirators distributed by a student-led organization Thursday.\n\n\"I have many friends who have been coughing up blood and [were] forced to seek emergency medical help because of the air and Berkeley's unwillingness to act,\" Greene said.\n\nThe student association itself decided to hand out masks Thursday, she said, leading to large crowds as people \"desperately [tried] to get respirators from [the] student-run club, which ran out in the first five minutes and turned into a mob scene.\"\n\nIn stores near Berkeley, masks also quickly sold out, Greene said, leading to \"an absurd sort of competition between students to get one.\" Students lucky enough to get the masks, she said, were trying to sell them at \"absurd prices.\"\n\nIn a message to students announcing Friday's cancellation, the school's chancellor, Carol Christ, said Thursday that Berkeley had \"a limited supply of appropriate 'N-95' respirators available for those students with medical conditions that may make them particularly susceptible to the impact of degraded air quality.\"\n\nGreene called that \"too little too late\" and said masks are still difficult to come by. The university told students that \"even these relatively advanced masks provide limited protection and are not a substitute for staying indoors.\"\n\nJaffe, however, said that \"the masks definitely help\" if worn properly and are \"better than nothing,\" although staying in a building with filtered air offers the best protection.\n\nThe university, for its part, says it's doing the best it can. \"Our students, like our staff, our faculty and our neighbors, are without a doubt being impacted by one of the greatest natural disasters in California's history,\" Mogulof said. \"The university just does not have the ability to completely mitigate the impacts of this wildfire.\"\n\nStaying safe in the smoke\n\nParticulate matter is the \"number one environmental killer in the world,\" Jacob said, and \"the levels that are present in those areas affected by wildfires are like you might expect on a very polluted day in China or India.\"\n\nSmoke from fires releases particles small enough to make their way through our nose and into our lungs, Jaffe added, and \"young children and the elderly have the greatest risks for immediate health concerns.\"\n\nAnd because children with developing airways breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience PM can aggravate asthma, decrease lung function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, according to a study published last year in the Lancet And because childrenwith developing airways breathemore air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience more severe symptoms\n\n\"We give people advice to say indoors and to reduce exercise and things like that,\" Jaffe said, \"but those don't mitigate the problem too much.\" That's especially true in San Francisco, where many don't have air conditioning.\n\nWithout any sort of \"controlled system\" to filter air, Jaffe said, a building doesn't offer much protection against particulate matter. When air is properly filtered, though, people can \"reduce their PM exposure by about 90%\" by being inside, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf you have to go outside, Jaffe recommends an N95 respirator, a specially designed mask that provides \"very efficient filtration of airborne particles\" when worn correctly, according to the Food and Drug Administration\n\nThe agency warns that \"a proper fit cannot be achieved on children and people with facial hair,\" which means the masks \"may not provide full protection\" for those people.\n\nBut even if you are able to protect your lungs, Jaffe said, diminished air quality can be demoralizing. \"There's a mental health issue too,\" he said. \"Everybody is unhappy, and it's hard to enjoy life.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "MJ Lee and Ashley Killough, CNN", "title": "House Ethics Committee chides Meadows, Kihuen over sexual harassment allegations", "description": "The House Ethics Committee admonished two male lawmakers Friday related to investigations of alleged sexual harassment.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/politics/house-ethics-committee-mark-meadow-ruben-kihuen/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181116152650-kihuen-meadows-split-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:32:59Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) The House Ethics Committee admonished two male lawmakers Friday related to investigations of alleged sexual harassment.\n\nRepublican Rep.

He described the claims as inaccurate.\n\nBut a confrontation in a Capitol Hill hearing room this week shows the scale of the challenge facing government agencies as they try to address the problem of harassment at work.\n\nMax Stier of the Partnership for Public Service said the \"standards ought to be higher\" for government employees than for those in the private sector.\n\nBut, he added, the civil service faces trouble finding leaders who can implement changes that last. \"By and large,\" Stier said, \"they are not well supported by their leaders or the institutions they're working within.\"\n\nThe culture of the Forest Service has been repeatedly questioned in recent years in multiple lawsuits and a 2016 congressional hearing, as well as in reports by The New York Times and PBS\n\nChristiansen, who led the service in an interim capacity following Tooke's departure and formally took over the role in October, testified Thursday that she has established a complaint hotline, directed a deputy to improve the workplace environment, is reviewing the anti-harassment policy and has hired a third-party company to investigate claims of sexual harassment, rather than using Forest Service investigators.\n\nWhile the toxic culture for women as described in the inspector report stretches back years , Christiansen says she has taken a zero-tolerance approach. She said investigators have substantiated sexual harassment in 58% of cases they've looked into.\n\nAs Christiansen spoke, Shannon Reed, a former forest service air quality specialist who says she experienced sexual assault and harassment at the agency, also sat at the witness table. On some occasions, she shook her head and said Christiansen's information was inaccurate.\n\n\"I can confirm that all 34 cases that were aired on PBS have been investigated. All of the allegations,\" Christiansen said.\n\nRep. Brenda Lawrence, a Michigan Democrat, then turned to Reed. \"Would you agree that every single claim that was brought forward has been investigated?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, ma'am, I don't think they have been,\" Reed replied. \"And by the way, I was one of the 34 so I know they haven't.\"\n\nReed testified that a supervisor fired her earlier this year in retaliation for reporting that he repeatedly assaulted and harassed her. That manager told CNN the allegations against him are false, but declined to elaborate.\n\nReed also described what she said was a 2016 assault by Tooke, then a senior manager who was subsequently appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the Forest Service.\n\nTooke resigned earlier this year after other allegations of misconduct were made against him. Several calls to his home on Thursday from CNN were not answered.\n\nReed is one of more than 100 current and former Forest Service employees who wrote in an open letter to Christiansen last week that the \"new processes are designed to be check-the-box actions, with little actual intent to hold harassers accountable.\"\n\nThe letter says that in some cases Forest Service employees were required to attend team meetings on sexual harassment led by the \"managers with harassment claims against them.\"\n\nReed said she joined the Forest Service after previously experiencing sexual harassment while working for the National Park Service. The park service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday morning.\n\n\"Little did I know,\" Reed testified, \"I was jumping from the frying pan to the fire.\"\n\nShe said she was assaulted by Tooke at the Forest Service orientation program for new employees. He was then a regional forester, a senior management role, and they were attending a dinner with about 25 other people at the training.\n\n\"We were standing in the foyer of the restaurant waiting to be seated. Mr. Tooke was standing behind me and he grabbed my butt,\" Reed said at the hearing. \"He didn't say anything, he just had this creepy smile on his face like he got away with something. I was stunned but I didn't say anything. Several employees witnessed this and came over to me and protected me and they basically took care of me the rest of the week.\"\n\nTooke resigned in March 2018, after about seven months as Forest Service chief. In a statement announcing his resignation, he said some of the allegations against him were inaccurate, but said of those who came forward to make complaints, \"I admire their courage.\"\n\nReed testified that she was later fired from the Forest Service after a supervisor repeatedly harassed and assaulted her. She said she declined his invitations to drinks and to a hot springs, and added that he once \"called me at night and it was not for business.\"\n\nShe also said the supervisor \"yelled at me, threatened me, spit in my face, inappropriately touched me, grabbed my phone from my hand.\"\n\nInitially, Reed said, she did not file reports fearing retaliation and a negative relationship with the supervisor, but eventually did formally complain. She said she eventually received a poor performance review, was put in a probationary status and fired.\n\nThe supervisor, Jack Triepke, told CNN on Thursday Reed's allegations are \"all false,\" and said he had been \"cleared of all allegations through multiple complaints and investigations.\"\n\nOn several occasions during the hearing, Christiansen declined to comment specifically on Reed's experiences, or to say if she believed Reed's allegations.\n\nShe added that her own \"past experiences fuel my commitment to the Forest Service.\"\n\n\"I have been in public service for my entire 38-year career as a forester and a wildland firefighter. I know what it means to encounter harassment and discrimination in my workplace,\" she said \"I know the deep anguish it causes.

Neither number worked.\n\n\"Her birthday is today,\" Mack told CNN on Friday. Dorothy, a cancer survivor, turned 88.\n\nNow, Bechtold, Mack and hundreds of other people wait for news -- anything that will give them a molecule more hope.\n\n'We're desperate to find an answer'\n\nEven though their calls wouldn't go through, the families didn't stop trying.\n\nBechtold would call his mother's numbers every now and then, just to test the phone lines; maybe a call would get through somehow. Mack and his family began calling people who live in the same mobile home park.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the fire, they tried to speak with people still in the area, asking them to drive by Dorothy's property. In recent days, Mack's entire family has been calling hospitals, hoping that Dorothy had checked in.\n\nBoth have joined Facebook groups organized to connect loved ones with people who are missing.\n\nA neighbor told Steven Paul, Mack's son-in-law, that she owes her life to Dorothy's property manager going around all the homes and telling people to leave.\n\nThe only thing left of Dorothy's house at 6674 Pentz Road Space 19 is, \"ashes and sheet metal.\" Her car is not there.\n\nBechtold drove to Paradise and pinned up flyers with her picture at shelters.

And they're expecting me to give them positive information. I have no information to give them.\"\n\nAuthorities scramble to locate hundreds\n\nAs the full extent of the damage came into view, with almost the entire town of Paradise reduced to ash, it was clear the Mack and Bechtold efforts needed to escalate with the filing of a missing person report.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Department says family and friends wanting to file should call 530-538-6570, 530-538-7544 or 530-538-7671.\n\nCallers must speak to a person, rather than leave voicemails.\n\nAnd they are urged to provide an update if they hear back from their missing loved ones.\n\n\"We are right now going off of people that have called in either welfare checks or to report someone missing,\" Investigations Sgt.

But there is no pocket of America where the erosion in GOP support is more striking than Orange County.\n\nLaboring against a strong tide of disdain, and even disgust, for President Donald Trump, Republicans lost their grip on the wealthy enclaves along the coast in northern Orange County that comprise the district held by 15-term Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. They lost by a much larger margin along the coast farther south in the district of retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, which includes the San Clemente home where Richard Nixon holed up to write his memoirs after resigning from the White House.\n\nOn the days leading up to Election Day, GOP officials had been slightly more optimistic that they would hold the inland Orange County district represented by GOP Rep. Mimi Walters, who had served as the deputy chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee in Washington. But Walters conceded to her rival, UC-Irvine law professor and Elizabeth Warren prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Katie Porter late last week after the latest batch of ballots counted by election officials made a GOP victory seem impossible.\n\nThe last of the four seats to fall was California's racially-diverse 39th District in northern Orange County. Republican Young Kim, an immigrant from South Korea who highlighted her family's journey to America, was one of the GOP's best hopes for reflecting the growing diversity of a district that is more than a third Hispanic and 31% Asian.\n\nBut Kim conceded to Democrat Gil Cisneros late Saturday night in their race for the open seat of retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce.\n\n\"We are seeing a realignment with college-educated voters and Orange County is ground zero for this phenomenon,\" said Sean Clegg, a California-based Democratic strategist who advises US Sen. Kamala Harris and California Governor-Elect Gavin Newsom. \"This election was a clear referendum on Trump and Trumpism and people want the reality show to end, particularly suburban women.\"\n\nThe Democrats' success in flipping all four seats from red to blue is a stunning development for a county that served as the North Star for Reagan-style conservatism.\n\n\"The cataclysmic losses in Orange County are the manifestation of changing demographics that have been in motion for a couple decades. Trump has accelerated the political consequences the GOP,\" said Rob Stutzman, a California-based Republican strategist, noting that the lesser-known GOP candidate for governor, John Cox, is still winning the county by a slender margin, according to the latest results posted by the Orange County Registrar of Voters.\n\n\"That's good evidence that the congressional losses are a Trump effect,\" said Stutzman. \"The GOP can compete to win those seats back in two years and new district maps in 2022 will possibly yield a clear GOP seat. The 'Orange Curtain' has fallen but Republicans will still compete in Orange County for the next few election cycles. They'll be more likely to succeed without Trump on the ballot.\"\n\nFred Smoller, an associate professor of political science at Chapman University in Orange County, noted that the GOP now has a 1% registration advantage in the county, compared to a 22% advantage in 1990.\n\n\"The Republican Party has taken a serious hit in Orange County, but it has not collapsed,\" Smoller said in an email. \"The congress folks who won -- Levin and Cisneros -- got their winning margins in San Diego and Los Angeles counties. (The Congressional districts overlap OC). Republicans control the Board of Supervisors, the District Attorney's office, Sheriff, and most city councils.\"\n\nStill the sting of the losses was pronounced because of the region's history. Orange County was the place that fostered the conservative movement driven by the John Birch Society in the 1960s.\n\nOrange County activists powered the passage of Prop 13, which limited property taxes, and later the passage of Prop 187 -- the 1994 ballot measure that would have barred immigrants from getting basic state services. That measure, which was ultimately struck down by the courts, irrevocably shifted Latinos in California toward the Democratic Party.\n\nThis time Orange County voters revolted against the racially-tinged and misogynistic rhetoric of Trump. Well-liked incumbents like Walters labored against Trump's villainy of immigrants and the migrant caravan and his suggestion that he could alter birthright citizenship.\n\nMoreover, the Republican tax bill became an albatross for Walters and Rohrabacher because of the way it altered state and local deductions -- a blow to homeowners in a county where the median home price is now beyond $715,000.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Republican losses in the white-collar suburbs of Orange County mark the death knell of establishment Republicans, or if the losses after Trump's hostile takeover of the party alter the calculus in 2020.\n\nBut the possibility that \"Orange is the new blue,\" as Newsom and his Democratic colleagues like to say, marks a stunning transformation for the region and a chilling sign for the establishment wing of the Republicans Party.\n\nReagan delighted in making his \"good Republicans\" quip at fundraisers before GOP donors.\n\nAt one event where he made that joke in Anaheim in November 1986, the then-President also noted how essential Orange County had been to his own success (in his run for governor) and the success of the party.\n\n\"Everything we've accomplished since then in Sacramento and, yes, in Washington began with that margin of victory provided here in Orange County,\" Reagan said.\n\nAfter just one cycle of Trump -- and decades of demographic changes that weigh in Democrats' favor -- the Republican Party is now watching all that work unravel in the place where it began."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "cnaserallah", "title": "\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u062a\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0646\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0639\u0645\u062f\u0629 \u0647\u0648\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0631\u0624\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641", "description": "\u0641\u0627\u062c\u0623\u062a \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0637\u0639\u0629 \u0647\u0648\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0643\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0648\u0631\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0646\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0639\u0645\u062f\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u062e\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u062a\u0633\u0645\u062d \u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0631\u0629.", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/entertainment/video/2018/11/17/v68204-colorblind-deputy-glasses", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/16/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-16%20at%2011.55.42%20PM.jpg?itok=q2JmWHc9", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:02:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "02:33\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \"\u0644\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647\u0627\" \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629.. \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a\u061f"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "David Axelrod, CNN Senior Political Commentator", "title": "Democrats, think twice before you reject Nancy Pelosi", "description": "To have a chance, Pelosi will have to make concessions, including an explicit promise of transition, David Axelrod writes.

But now it's gaining traction among an unlikely audience: car makers.\n\nToyota is one of a growing number of auto makers hoping augmented-reality headsets can improve everything from designing cars to manufacturing and fixing them. These headsets let users merge 3-D images with the real world.\n\nFor example, Ford and heavy-duty truck maker Paccar are among those using the HoloLens to help design cars, and Daimler recently said it purchased over 100 HoloLens headsets to train its mechanics with 3-D models of vehicles and parts like brake systems.\n\nBut the augmented-reality market is still small: Eric Abbruzzese, an augmented- and virtual-reality analyst with ABI Research, expects more than 2 million headsets and smart glasses will ship this year. Most of that market is made up of businesses still testing the technology. Abbruzzese predicts it will grow to 29 million by 2023.\n\nThe most recent example of car makers adopting the technology is Toyota. At its headquarters in Japan's Aichi prefecture, employees like Koichi Kayano are experimenting with HoloLens for a variety of tasks. Kayano, a project manager who finds ways to use 3-D models across the company, is using the headset to speed up the process of measuring the thickness of a vehicle's paint and rust-prevention coatings to ensure consistent color and avoid corrosion.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Chris Isidore, CNN Business", "title": "Bankrupt Sears wants to give executives $19 million in bonuses", "description": "Sears is seeking court approval to pay executives as much as $19 million in quarterly bonuses while the company struggles to restructure in bankruptcy.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/business/sears-executive-bonuses/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181116121849-01-sears-sign-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:08:47Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "New York (CNN Business) Sears is seeking court approval to pay executives as much as $25 million in annual bonuses while the company struggles to restructure in bankruptcy.\n\nThree top executives could get nearly $1 million each if the company goes out of business.

El protocolo fue considerado por Assange y su defensa como un atentado a sus derechos.\n\nOtro escenario que baraja con preocupaci\u00f3n la defensa del australiano nacionalizado ecuatoriano en 2017 es que el gobierno de Ecuador retire el asilo a Assange y que esto pueda precipitar su salida de la embajada de Ecuador en Londres.\n\nEl abogado Poveda califica este posible escenario como \u201cuna estrategia que ser\u00eda muy h\u00e1bil\u201d por parte del Ecuador.\n\nEntre tanto, Salvador exhort\u00f3 a Assange y a su defensa para que \u201cno alerten o especulen designios maliciosos por parte del gobierno ecuatoriano\u201d y enfatiz\u00f3 que \u201cel Ecuador ratifica una y mil veces a Assange que puede quedarse en la embajada si se atiene al protocolo establecido\u201d.\n\nEl procurador le dijo a CNN que no ha recibido por ahora notificaciones de incumplimientos del protocolo de visitas y comunicaciones por parte de Assange, aunque asegura que en los \u00faltimos d\u00edas se ha rehusado a utilizar el servicio de internet inal\u00e1mbrico que provee la embajada ecuatoriana en Londres."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Mallory Simon, CNN", "title": "Jewish woman wins court fight to be able to sue Neo-Nazi publisher", "description": "The case against a Neo-Nazi publisher can proceed to trial on accusations he called for a \"troll storm\" against a Jewish woman, a federal judge ruled.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/us/jewish-woman-court-fight-sue-neo-nazi-publisher/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170705151408-tanya-gersh-andrew-anglin-split-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:20:48Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) The case against a Neo-Nazi publisher can proceed to trial on accusations he called for a \"troll storm\" against a Jewish woman, a federal judge ruled.\n\nClaims by Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin that the First Amendment protected his speech were not enough to dismiss the case at this point, the judge said.\n\nTanya Gersh says harassing messages reached her in every corner of her life.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to hold Anglin liable for using his website to encourage his thousands of readers to contact Tanya Gersh, a Realtor in Montana. Most of the messages contained hate-filled, anti-Semitic language.\n\nGersh, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, is suing Anglin for \"invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and violations of Montana's Anti-Intimidation Act.\" That suit was filed in April 2017 in the US District Court for Montana.\n\nAnglin's call for dismissal was rejected first by US Magistrate Judge Jeremiah C. Lynch and that decision is now supported by Dana L. Christensen , chief judge of the US District Court in Missoula.\n\nThe troll storm began after a dispute between Gersh and fellow Whitefish resident Sherry Spencer. Spencer is the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer. Gersh became a target for hate after contacting tenants of a building owned by Sherry Spencer, warning them about possible protests over Richard Spencer's views.\n\nAnglin wrote about the case on the Daily Stormer, accusing Gersh of \"extortion.\" He encouraged his \"troll army\" of readers to tell Gersh what they thought of her and posted her personal information and ways to reach her.\n\nGersh and her family were then contacted hundreds of times . She was sent images with her face on the gates of the Nazi Auschwitz death camp. There was a voicemail with the sound of gunshots. There were letters sent to the home she shared with her husband and young son, who also received messages on social media.\n\nLynch ruled against Anglin earlier this year when Anglin argued he wasn't responsible for the messages from readers of his site, that Gersh should be considered a public figure, and that, in the end, the speech was protected by the First Amendment. Anglin objected to the ruling, sending the case for review.\n\nJudge Christensen's ruling this week puts the case closer to a civil trial.\n\n\"The Court has thoroughly considered his free speech arguments and finds that a decision for Anglin at this stage would, at minimum, be premature,\" Christensen wrote.\n\nProminent First Amendment attorney Marc Randazza, who is representing Anglin, told CNN it was important to note \"this is just the motion to dismiss phase.\"\n\n\"What the judge did was hold that, if everything that the plaintiff claims is true is actually supported by evidence, then they could win,\" Randazza told CNN. \" This does not mean that the First Amendment is no longer in effect.\"\n\nAmong the issues was whether the dispute between Anglin and Gersh was essentially a private conflict, but also whether Anglin could be held responsible for the actions of his readers.\n\n\"The harm alleged by Gersh is precisely the type of harm not only anticipated but requested by Anglin in his Daily Stormer posts,\" Christensen wrote.\n\nRandazza, Anglin's attorney, argued the ruling in this case could have widespread impact on free speech and that it is not about whether you agree with Anglin's views, but whether he should be able to express them.\n\n\"The rule we lay down for the Nazi applies equally to the civil rights activist and, in fact, to all of us,\" Randazza told CNN. \"And that ruling, if it stands, is not going to be good for anyone who engages in common outrage culture. Maybe that's a good thing, but I think not.\"\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center and its lawyer, David Dinielli, who is representing Gersh, celebrated the ruling as a win.\n\n\"Today's ruling underscores what both we and our client have said from the beginning of this case -- that online campaigns of hate, threats, and intimidation have no place in a civil society, and enjoy no protection under our Constitution,\" Dinielli said in a statement."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0635\u0631

office is on track to break records this year, crossing the $10 billion mark faster than ever before.\n\nBig films like Marvel's \" Black Panther \" and surprise hits like \" A Quiet Place \" have so far contributed to the massive domestic box office haul, which is 10.5% ahead of last year and 5.7% ahead of 2016's record year, according to ComScore. And there are still several months left in 2018.\n\nThe hits came all year in 2018 and not just during the summer blockbuster months like most have in the past. \"Black Panther,\" \" Avengers: Infinity War \" and \" Venom \" all set records at the box office, and did so in February, April and October, respectively. It wasn't just comic book movies, either. \" Halloween ,\" \" A Star Is Born \" and \"A Quiet Place\" all exceeded expectations at the box office, making it an endless summer at the cineplex.\n\nA year round blockbuster schedule has been a growing trend in Hollywood, but other factors such as diversity and the popularity of movie subscription services such as MoviePass has really helped put 2018 over the top.\n\n\"We've seen so much momentum up to this point that it would probably take an unpredictable outside force to prevent a new record,\" he said.\n\nIn 2016, the film industry raked in $11.4 billion, but that achievement came with a bit of an asterisk since the record numbers could be attributed, in part, to a rise in ticket prices rather than more foot traffic at theaters.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, believes that there's more than just inflation at work this year.\n\n\"Certainly increased ticket prices powers higher revenue, but the gains this year are not just in terms of a rising dollar,\" Dergarabedian told CNN Business. \"A 10% plus advantage over 2017 means that more people are indeed going to the movies.\"\n\nRobbins also pointed out that diversity dominated the box office in 2018 with nearly half of the top 20 films starring or co-starring women or people of color. That includes \"Black Panther,\" \"Ocean's 8\" and \" Crazy Rich Asians .\"\n\n\"Representation on the big screen has taken a huge leap forward this year,\" he said.\n\nMoviePass could've also had a hand in the box office's successful year.\n\nThe subscription service, which made a splash when it began charging $10 a month for access to one movie a day, skyrocketed in popularity this year accumulating 3 million subscribers before crashing back to earth over the summer.\n\nWhile its impact is hard to gauge, Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations, believes MoviePass may have given a bit of a boost to this year's numbers.\n\n\"MoviePass and other subscription-based services cannot be undervalued,\" Bock told CNN Business. \"Even though MoviePass is struggling, they ushered in a new way of movie going and jolted the industry.\"\n\nThe final stretch of 2018 begins this weekend with \" Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald .\" The prequel, which takes place in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, nabbed $9.1 million on Thursday night and is expected to bring in around $65 million at the domestic box office for Warner Bros.\n\nThere are still more potential hits to come as 2018 winds down: \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" and \"Creed II\" come out next week and \"Aquaman\" and \"Mary Poppins Returns\" premiere next month.\n\n\"I don't see anything stopping the box office avalanche at this point,\" Bock added.\n\nThat avalanche could slide into 2019, which may be another record year with films such as \"Avengers 4,\" \"The Lion King\" and \"Star Wars: Episode IX\" all on the docket."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Polo Sandoval and Sonia Moghe, CNN", "title": "More testimony of bloodshed and bribes seems certain as 'El Chapo' trial's first week draws to a close", "description": "If the first week of testimony in Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n Loera's trial is any indication, jurors may be in for more grisly tales of bloodshed and deep-rooted corruption when court is back in session.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/us/el-chapo-trial-week-one/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114000634-juicio-el-chapo-guzman-cargos-fiscal-acusaciones-calderon-pena-nieto-samuel-gonzalez-intvw-aristegui-00010216-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:08:36Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "New York (CNN) If the first week of testimony in Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n Loera's trial is any indication, jurors may be in for more grisly tales of bloodshed and deep-rooted corruption when court is back in session.\n\nThe jury, which given the defendant's violent history is anonymous and partly sequestered , already has heard sworn statements befitting a made-for-TV narco drama. Jurors are due back Monday and Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn, then in recess until after the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nDelivering the bulk of shocking details in the opening days of Guzm\u00e1n's trial on charges of drug trafficking, conspiring to murder rivals, gun crimes and money laundering was a key government witness: Jesus Zambada Garcia, also known as \"El Rey,\" or \"The King.\"\n\nThe imprisoned cartel chief on Wednesday described the inner-workings of the Sinaloa Cartel and its central figures, including his brother, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n \"was my brother's partner,\" Zambada Garcia told jurors. \"My brother and 'Chapo' came to an agreement that they were going to establish a 50-50 partnership.\"\n\nZambada Garcia recalled paying off countless Mexican officials during his stint, from 1987 to 2001, with the Sinaloa Cartel. Once, Guzm\u00e1n asked him to deliver $100,000 to a Mexican military general to ensure a drug shipment was delivered without interruption, Zambada Garcia said.\n\nZambada Garcia also testified that he helped coordinate Guzm\u00e1n's escape in 2001 from a Mexican prison by helping to get a helicopter to Guzm\u00e1n, he said, adding it was the first time he met Guzm\u00e1n face to face.\n\nPleasure in a rival's death alleged\n\nPerhaps some of the most compelling testimony from Zambada Garcia touched on a violent narco war. He mentioned having knowledge that Guzm\u00e1n planned to kill a rival cartel leader, Ramon Arellano Felix, who'd clashed with Guzm\u00e1n over control of drug-smuggling routes.\n\nFelix was killed in 2002, a decade after a failed attempt on his life during a shootout at a Mexican nightclub. Zambada Garcia learned from his brother that police in the Mexican state of Sinaloa had stopped Felix and shot him when he tried to flee, he testified.\n\n\"If anything had given him (Guzm\u00e1n) pleasure, it was Ramon Arellano's death,\" Zambada Garcia said in court as Guzm\u00e1n sat at the defense table.\n\nZambada Garcia, who's due back on the stand Monday, awaits sentencing since he pleaded guilty to federal drug charges and agreed to cooperate with the government.\n\nProsecutors called up two other witnesses during Week 1 of Guzm\u00e1n's trial: a former US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who discovered a smuggling tunnel from Mexico to Arizona in 1990 and a US Drug Enforcement Administration agent who tested nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine discovered in connection with that tunnel.\n\nRuthless cartel kingpin or just the fall guy?\n\nContrasting pictures of Guzm\u00e1n emerged during opening statements in the trial, which attorneys on both sides expect to last at least four months. Guzm\u00e1n faces life in prison if convicted.\n\nAssistant US Attorney Adam Fels on Tuesday pointed to Guzm\u00e1n and described him as the hands-on boss of a criminal empire once capable of reaping $10 million in profits monthly from cocaine deals.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n commanded an army of gunmen with a diamond-encrusted pistol and a gold-plated rifle at his side, Fels said.\n\n\"Guzm\u00e1n himself pulled the trigger and ordered the disposal of bodies,\" he said.\n\nDefense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman argued the case was a ploy to blame one man for drugs that infiltrated the United States, even after Guzm\u00e1n's capture.\n\n\"(Guzm\u00e1n) was either in prison or hiding out from 1993 to 2017; the flow of drugs never slowed down,\" Lichtman said. \"Yet, he's blamed for being the leader. The truth is, he was the leader of nothing.\"\n\nFandom and fear in the jury pool\n\nEven before opening statements, the high-stakes nature of the case was clear.\n\nAmong several potential jurors dismissed was a man who asked a court officer to help him get an autograph from Guzm\u00e1n.\n\n\"I'm a bit of a fan,\" the man told the judge.\n\nA full-time Michael Jackson impersonator was dismissed over fears he could be identified. Another potential juror was excused after revealing he frequently ordered a sandwich named after \"El Chapo.\"\n\nTwo more dismissals were granted after the jury of seven women and five men, plus six alternates, was seated November 7. A woman who'd burst into tears out of concern for her personal safety was released after she said serving on the jury would exacerbate her medical conditions. Another juror was excused after claiming financial hardship, though he'd left that off his jury questionnaire.\n\nDays before opening arguments, Guzm\u00e1n's legal team petitioned to allow their client to get a hug from his beauty queen wife. The court denied that request."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump responds to judge's CNN ruling", "description": "President Donald Trump reacts to the judge's ruling that Jim Acosta should regain his White House press pass.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2018/11/16/trump-comments-cnn-lawsuit-ruling-sot-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181116124958-01-trump-comments-acosta-1116-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:07:51Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Porter ran a disciplined campaign against her, relentlessly casting Walters as a rubber stamp for the Trump administration.\n\nWith Walters' concession, Democrats have now picked up a net gain of 34 seats in the House. Six races remain to be called by CNN, and Democrats lead in five of them. All of the uncalled districts are currently held by Republicans.\n\nWalters was also hurt by her support for the Republican tax bill, which altered state and local deductions at a huge cost to California homeowners \u2014 particularly in the wealthy enclaves of Orange County. That, paired with the anger toward Trump among college-educated women, took a heavy toll on Walters in the well-educated areas of Irvine, the heart of her district.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Michael Nedelman, CNN", "title": "11th child dies in adenovirus outbreak in New Jersey", "description": "An 11th child has died and 23 additional children have become sick in connection with an adenovirus outbreak at a New Jersey health care facility, the state's Department of Health announced Friday.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/health/wanaque-adenovirus-deaths-new-jersey-bn/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181023160157-wanaque-center-exterior-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:36:59Z", "content": "(CNN) An 11th child has died and 23 additional children have become sick in connection with an adenovirus outbreak at a New Jersey health care facility, the state's Department of Health announced Friday.

They became sick at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell, New Jersey.\n\nAn ongoing investigation has revealed that not being able to separate the sick from those without symptoms -- in part due to \"limitations in the facilities\" -- is among the \"major reasons for the outbreak being as severe as it has been,\" Dr. Shereef Elnahal, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health, said Friday.\n\nBut after deaths and hospitalizations, the facility now has enough space to separate them.\n\n\"Up until this week, it has not been possible to completely separate those patients,\" Elnahal said. \"But now, due to decreasing census at the facility, it is.\"\n\nOn Thursday, health officials requested help separating those who are sick, putting out a statewide call for volunteers from New Jersey Medical Reserve Corps. The health department has required that the Wanaque facility finish the process by Wednesday.\n\n\"The fact that we are continuing to see new, confirmed cases at this point, despite all efforts toward strict adherence to protocols, has made the facility's layout limitations clear,\" Elnahal said in a statement this week.\n\nCiting \"serious infection control deficiencies cited in ongoing inspections,\" the health department has also required the Wanaque facility to hire new staffers with expertise in infection control, including an infectious disease doctor.\n\nState health officials are prohibiting any new admissions to the facility, and requests to readmit former residents must be specifically approved.\n\nMore on the outbreak\n\nState health officials have said the outbreak can be declared over only once four weeks pass without an additional case. Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus, the state health department said.\n\nThe children affected by the outbreak became ill between September 26 and November 12, according to the health department. The number has risen from 18 cases, including six deaths, announced last month by the health department.\n\nA staff member was also affected by the outbreak but has recovered.\n\nThe outbreak in the Wanaque facility was caused by adenovirus type 7. This type is \"most commonly associated with acute respiratory disease,\" according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"This is an extremely severe strain of adenovirus that couldn't have occurred in a worse place,\" Elnahal said Friday.\n\nOther types of adenovirus infections can cause flu-like symptoms, pinkeye and diarrhea.\n\nEight cases of adenovirus have also been found among children at a second New Jersey facility, Voorhees Pediatric Facility. However, tests suggest that the culprit is adenovirus type 3, a different strain than the one in Wanaque.\n\nPatients at the Voorhees facility became ill between October 20 and November 9. A previous inspection by the state health department found no infection control problems and issued no citations.\n\nHealth officials say they are stepping up efforts to strengthen infection control at such facilities in the state.

The words \"Witch Hunt\" appeared only once in his Twitter feed in the month of October, as Trump instead focused on the midterm elections.\n\nThat ended Thursday morning, when the President sent a series of tweets lashing out against special counsel Robert Mueller and the Russia probe. The tweets came as Trump has spent much of the past week meeting with his lawyers, as CNN has reported , reviewing written questions about Russian collusion that were submitted by Mueller and his team.\n\nOn Thursday, the President resurrected several of his favorite lines of attack that, while potent with his political base, aren't grounded in evidence or facts. As speculation swirls over Mueller's next moves, following a period of silence in the weeks leading up to the midterms, it's worth fact-checking the President's claims. Here's a breakdown of some of the inaccuracies.\n\nThe inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don't...\n\nFact-check of \"inner workings\"\n\nThere haven't been any recent news articles detailing supposed dysfunction on Mueller's team. It's not clear how Trump would hear about the \"inner workings\" of the investigation. After this tweet, some of Trump's critics speculated that he might have learned new details from acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who is now overseeing the investigation. If true, that would raise concerns that Trump was possibly trying to interfere with the probe.\n\nFact-check of \"found no collusion\"\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, so it is premature for the President to declare that Mueller \"found no collusion.\" The special counsel hasn't said anything public about whether there was or wasn't collusion. Mueller will detail his final conclusions in a report that is expected to drop sometime in the coming months.\n\n....care how many lives the ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2018\n\nFact-check of \"highly conflicted\"\n\nThe Justice Department determined in May 2017 that there were no ethics conflicts with Mueller's appointment as special counsel. They looked into the issue because Mueller's former law firm, WilmerHale, represented some key players in the investigation.\n\nFact-check of \"worked for Obama for 8 years\"\n\nThis is incorrect. President George W. Bush tapped Mueller for FBI director in 2001. When Mueller's 10-year term was about to expire in 2011, then-President Barack Obama asked him to stay on for an additional two years. The Senate unanimously approved that extension. So, Mueller spent less than five years under Obama.\n\nUniversities will someday study what highly conflicted (and NOT Senate approved) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people. Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary, Comey, McCabe, Lisa Page & her lover, Peter S, and all of his friends on the other side? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2018\n\nFact-check of \"NOT Senate approved\"\n\nThis is misleading. Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and, like many other DOJ appointees, he did not require Senate confirmation for the position. Some of Mueller's critics have mounted legal challenges to his appointment, making the claim that he needed Senate approval. But so far, federal judges have rejected this argument.\n\nFact-check of \"gang of Democrat thugs\"\n\nSetting aside the vitriolic language of \"gangs\" and \"thugs\" for a moment, it's true that several lawyers who worked for Mueller donated to Democratic candidates or were registered Democrats. But importantly, about half of the team never donated to anyone. Mueller himself is a registered Republican -- and so is Rosenstein, who picked him.\n\nThe only \"Collusion\" is that of the Democrats with Russia and many others. Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC? They still don't have it. Check out how biased Facebook, Google and Twitter are in favor of the Democrats. That's the real Collusion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2018\n\nFact-check of \"take the Server\"\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers last year that the FBI asked the Democratic National Committee to hand over its servers during the federal investigation into Russian hacking. Instead, the DNC hired a private cybersecurity firm to examine their servers and provided that information to the FBI. Comey said this arrangement was not preferred, but his team determined it was \"an appropriate substitute.\"\n\nFact-check of \"in favor of the Democrats\"\n\nIn fact, the DOJ alleged in an indictment that Russian trolls used these social media sites to spread propaganda that was designed to undermine American democracy and, in some cases, support Trump's candidacy during the 2016 campaign."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Sandra Gonzalez, CNN", "title": "'Dogs' is a feel-good tale about BFFs with tails", "description": "In case you've missed the memo, feelings are big on TV right now.

(In addition to Berg, critically hailed directors Roger Ross Williams, Heidi Ewing, Richard Hankin and T.J. Martin and Daniel Lindsay also helm episodes.)\n\nThe connection between an owner and their dog -- and, at times, heroes and every dog -- is largely the source of the magic in and beauty of \"Dogs.\"\n\nSimply put: There's a lot of dog-human hugs, awww-worthy snout close-ups and a beautiful score that will make any effort to keep emotional composure, well, ruff.\n\nThe social media reaction to the \"Dogs' trailer -- which, if the comments are any indication, left a lot of people crying at their desks at work -- caused executive producer Glen Zipper to feel compelled to clarify at every opportunity that \"it's not a sad show.\"\n\n\"We're very, very cautious about giving anyone any spoilers, but, suffice it to say Amy and I are equally uncomfortable with seeing anything terribly sad or animal put way,\" he said. \"We made a series through that lens and while there might be some challenging moments across the series, I think everyone will walk away from each episode feeling pretty happy.\"\n\nHe added: \"We think they're good cries.\"\n\nThe endings seen in the episodes are also not too far removed from the present-day. The last shooting day for the series was in late May -- just a few months ago.\n\n\"They're pretty much hot off the presses,\" Zipper said.\n\nThe six episodes were filmed and edited over eight short months. The hardest part was, seemingly, choosing which stories to feature.\n\nThey're eager to do more -- if the present-day craving for TV that inspires feelings of joy attracts an audience large enough to earn them a green light from Netflix.\n\n\"We're living in such divisive times right now, it seems like our bond with dogs is something that is so universal and no matter what end of the political spectrum you're on. No matter what your belief system, it's one thing that we're all connected to,\" Zipper said. \"And in that one idyllic, uniformity of love that we all experience, hopefully we can find a little bit more than we have in common with each other through this show.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jack Guy, CNN", "title": "Jony Ive and Marc Newson's all-diamond ring set for auction", "description": "Jony Ive and Marc Newson's bespoke all-diamond ring will be auctioned by Sotheby's during Art Basel Miami Beach.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/style/article/jony-ive-diamond-ring-sothebys-scli-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181116144159-red-auction-all-diamond-ring-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:27:44Z", "content": "luxury Published 16th November 2018 If you're in the market for one-of-a-kind jewelry, take note: An all-diamond ring will be auctioned by Sotheby's next month.

The manual recount currently underway is only of those ballots, where election officials use guidelines from the state of Florida and their own judgment to determine whether a voter meant to vote to one candidate or another.\n\nIn Broward County, the number of over and undervotes was over 30,000 ballots. In Palm Beach County, that number was around 6,000, according to Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher.\n\nThose votes now represent the only chance Nelson has to close the gap, and even then, the likelihood is dim.\n\nBroward County elections officials announced on Friday morning that they had completed sorting their over and under votes, and the county's canvassing board was now reviewing the ballots and would announce the decision of those in dispute, meaning the intent of the voter was clearly in question.\n\nBucher, who testified before Walker's court on Thursday, told the judge that her team would finish the machine recount on the Senate race on Friday and then need three to five hours to complete the hand recount. She said that all could happen at some point on Friday.\n\nElias tried to project confidence on a call with reporters on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"It has never been our view that there was going to be one silver bullet that was going to change the margin in this race,\" Elias said, noting that Democrats' strategy has long been that they would need a series of wins in court and with election officials to bring home a win for Nelson.\n\nTo date, that hasn't happened.\n\nNelson's lawyers did score a narrow win on Thursday when Walker ruled voters whose mismatched signatures disqualified their provisional and mail-in ballots and who were \"belatedly notified\" of the problem have until Saturday at 5 p.m. to correct those signature problems.\n\nBut even that victory was muted. Lawyers for Nelson and other Democrats had asked for the ballots in question to be counted with no review of the signatures at all. And even though Elias and others celebrated the ruling, Uzoma Nkwonta, a lawyer for Nelson's campaign in the case, told the judge in the hearing that a ruling that only extended the deadline by a few days -- which is what Walker ordered -- \"would probably be insufficient.\"\n\nWalker also denied a request on Thursday that would have made it easier for Nelson's campaign to reach out to voters who had mismatched signatures on their ballots. The lawyers had asked for the judge to require the Florida Secretary of State to release the names of people whose ballots had not been counted because their signatures did not match ones on file. Walker, quite directly, took a dim view of that argument and rejected it from the bench.\n\n\"I am not going to be used by either party,\" Walker told the lawyers. \"That's the kind of gamesmanship that would undermine our democracy further.\"\n\nAnd Walker also rejected the Democrats' request to remove the state's deadlines for machine and manual vote recounts on Thursday.\n\n\"This Court must be able to craft a remedy with knowledge that it will not prove futile. It cannot do so on this record,\" Walker wrote. \"This Court does not and will not fashion a remedy in the dark.\"\n\nThe hits kept coming on Friday evening, when Walker denied a motion from lawyers for VoteVets Action Fund and a series of Democratic organizations who were seeking to stop the state of Florida from enforcing the vote-by-mail deadline. The suit argued that voters should not be held responsible for the speed of the US Postal Service and their ballots should be treated similar to ballots mailed from overseas, which have a later deadline.\n\nWalker did not agree, meaning Florida's vote-by-mail deadlines will stand and domestic vote by mail ballots received after Election Day will not be counted.\n\nScott's campaign heralded the decision, arguing that it showed it was \"long past time for Bill Nelson to face the facts: this charade is over, Floridians' votes have been counted multiple times, and Rick Scott is the next Senator from Florida.\"\n\nSome decisions remain for Walker, however, and they could go Nelson's way. VoteVets Action Fund and a series of Democratic organizations urged Walker on Thursday to invalidate Florida law that says domestic mailed ballots must arrive in elections offices by election night. The suit argues that voters should not be held responsible for the speed of the US Postal Service and should be treated similar to overseas mailed ballots, which have a later deadline.\n\nWalker did not indicate on Thursday how he would rule on the matter, but even if he does rule in favor of the Democratic interests on the matter, it is unlikely to be enough vote to close the Nelson's deficit. Supervisor of Elections for Leon County Mark Earley testified during the hearing that the number of domestic mail-in ballots that came in after the deadline this year was 178 in his jurisdiction, which includes Tallahassee. While that number would be larger in more populous counties like Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade, it is highly unlikely to be enough for Nelson.\n\nFor Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida, the path to victory in a recount has closed.\n\nGillum trails former Rep. Ron DeSantis by over 33,000 votes -- a margin that actually went DeSantis' way by one vote during the machine recount.\n\nGillum has not conceded and, in a statement on Thursday, indicated he would not get out of the race.\n\nIn an interview with Pod Save America published Thursday, Gillum said he was in \"fighting shape\" in Tallahassee and was looking forward to getting every vote counted."},

Undeterred by the loss of his second job as executive chairman at Breitbart in January, he has pushed his campaign for worldwide national populism and declared his support for far-right leaders all over Europe, even backpedaling on his former rejection of hated \"establishment\" platforms to further his cause.\n\nMany have protested, with figures such as Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon refusing to appear alongside him at the risk of \"normalizing far-right, racist views.\"\n\nAfter the news was released, and an understandable outrage ensued, current Union President Stephen Hovarth told the Oxford Student : \"It is only through listening to the opinions of others that we can fully understand those opinions. Whether we are inclined to agree or disagree with them, there is a profound intellectual value in critically thinking through why it is that we agree or disagree instead of just rejecting them out of hand.\"\n\nHow profound is the intellectual value of \"critically thinking through\" Steve Bannon? Possibly very. He masterminded Trump's ascendance to the White House, and in so doing correctly identified a hunger felt by swathes of the American population that was neglected at a bitter cost by the left.\n\nUnder Bannon's stewardship, Breitbart pedaled myths about black crime, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, and islamophobia. His advocacy of national populism echoes -- and very deliberately expatiates -- far-right movements across Europe. He certainly merits urgent critical appraisal by anyone who is not a fan of ethno-nationalism or white supremacy.\n\n\"I think it's fine,\" one former Oxford Union president told me, when I asked them what they thought of Bannon's invitation. \"Everyone will have a lot of fun, the members, the people protesting outside... it will be a fun day out.\n\n\"It all comes down to -- on a high philosophical level -- freedom, and the ability to understand. There is a lot of database evidence that many people's ability is not that good... but ultimately, I believe in freedom.\"\n\nFreedom, though, is a currency whose value tends to diminish in proportion to the amount one has of it. It is easy, when one has only ever known an abundance of freedom, to take it for granted. When the news of Bannon's invite broke, the Oxford Labour Muslim network posted a statement saying: \"This cheap and dangerous publicity stunt can only be carried out by those who will never face the consequences of white supremacy and hate speech in their day to day lives.\"\n\nThose consequences can be devastating. The normalization of far-right rhetoric, the like of which Bannon consciously nurtured both at Breitbart and in the White House, has put wind into the sails of neo-Nazis. It has made light of atrocities like the Charlottesville violence in August last year, and stoked suspicions that immigrants are dangerous criminals. It has legitimized the kind of hatred which puts anyone who does not fit some twisted \"all-American\" ideal -- ironic, given Bannon's purported hatred of the establishment -- in real danger.\n\nPhotos: A history of free speech on campus College and universities have long been hubs of free speech -- and hotbeds of protest.

Hide Caption 15 of 15\n\nOne could pick from any number of Bannon's one-liners, whack a question mark at the end, and interrogate it over the course of a few thousand words. You could essay debates on the reasoning behind statements like \"guns are not a problem,\" \"Trump's zero tolerance on the border is a humanitarian policy,\" \"Tommy Robinson has got to be released from prison,\" or \"Let them call you racist, xenophobes, nativists, homophobes, misogynists -- wear it as a badge of honour!\", citing countless interviews Bannon has already given on these subjects. He has said it all before. So why ask him to repeat himself?\n\n\"The students will be able to challenge themselves against him,\" the ex-Union President enthused. \"I think they could land a punch. Unless something has changed, why not carry on as normal?\"\n\nThat question, of course, rests partly on the assumption that \"normal\" hitherto has been fine. That it is OK for dubious and even dangerous characters to be allowed into the bosom of one of the most renowned universities in the world for students to play with them.\n\nIt has been acknowledged by past members that for some -- relevant late examples being Boris Johnson and Michael Gove -- the debate itself is just a \"side-show;\" a means to a wholly selfish end. This must also follow for the guests, which renders the motivations of the individual, and the capacity of the platform at Oxford to facilitate them, crucial.\n\nBannon's rhetorical calling cards include: Jackson Pollock-smatterings of military terms, aggressive calls to action, swerving questions that don't serve his purpose, advocating for far-right leaders in America, Italy, France, Switzerland and Hungary, appeals to emotions above facts, and interrupting people. They do not include considered answers, or engagement with any kind of meaningful argument. In real life, when you hand Steve Bannon a mic, he runs with it.\n\nI asked the former Oxford Union President whether there was anyone whose invitation they would deem a \"move too far\" for the Union. After a pause, they replied: \"Off the top of my head, I think anyone who would use it to break the law -- slander, hate speech etc. And anyone whose physical presence would endanger the students.\n\n\"I would also say that if someone very very controversial is invited, it should be the case that they have to submit to lots of questions and challenges from the audience. If not, that obviates the point.\"\n\nTo my mind, that point is superseded by another. If flexing the intellectual muscles of a group of students comes at the cost of amplifying a man whose political program thus far has endangered the lives of thousands -- even millions -- of people across the world, and who is not done yet, it is not worth it."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Dan Merica, CNN", "title": "Bill Nelson suffers court setbacks as Florida hand recount continues", "description": "Sen.

Bill Nelson's already improbable path towards victory in a recount has gotten narrower, with the Democrat suffering a series of setbacks in court and in county election offices across the state.\n\nThe drumbeat of relatively bad news for Democrats in Florida has left any chance Nelson had of overtaking Republican Gov. Rick Scott's 12,603 vote lead in a recount as a longshot, at best, with the three-term senator needing to win an overwhelming number of votes in the ongoing manual recount or scoring a series of clear wins in court.\n\nNelson was handed a consequential loss early on Friday morning when Judge Mark Walker ruled that the guidelines Florida law provides to election canvassing boards as to how to determine voter intent in a manual recount are constitutional.\n\n\"The issue in this case is whether the use of these reasonable and neutral rules is constitutional,\" Walker said. \"It is.\"\n\nThe loss came around the same time Walker denied a request for Scott to recuse himself from election matters.\n\nNelson's lawyer's -- led by top Democratic attorney Marc Elias -- have argued the mere fact that the race went to a manual recount was enough of a win for them, given the number of votes in Democratic leaning counties that remain left to count.\n\nThey have kept a particularly close watch on Broward and Palm Beach counties, where election officials have said the number of overvotes -- when a voter selects too many candidates in one race -- and undervotes -- when a voter selects no candidates in one race -- number in the thousands. The manual recount currently underway is only of those ballots, where election officials use guidelines from the state of Florida and their own judgment to determine whether a voter meant to vote to one candidate or another.\n\nIn Broward County, the number of over and undervotes was over 30,000 ballots. In Palm Beach County, that number was around 6,000, according to Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher.\n\nThose votes now represent the only chance Nelson has to close the gap, and even then, the likelihood is dim.\n\nBroward County elections officials announced on Friday morning that they had completed sorting their over and under votes, and the county's canvassing board was now reviewing the ballots and would announce the decision of those in dispute, meaning the intent of the voter was clearly in question.\n\nBucher, who testified before Walker's court on Thursday, told the judge that her team would finish the machine recount on the Senate race on Friday and then need three to five hours to complete the hand recount. She said that all could happen at some point on Friday.\n\nElias tried to project confidence on a call with reporters on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"It has never been our view that there was going to be one silver bullet that was going to change the margin in this race,\" Elias said, noting that Democrats' strategy has long been that they would need a series of wins in court and with election officials to bring home a win for Nelson.\n\nTo date, that hasn't happened.\n\nNelson's lawyers did score a narrow win on Thursday when Walker ruled voters whose mismatched signatures disqualified their provisional and mail-in ballots and who were \"belatedly notified\" of the problem have until Saturday at 5 p.m. to correct those signature problems.\n\nBut even that victory was muted. Lawyers for Nelson and other Democrats had asked for the ballots in question to be counted with no review of the signatures at all. And even though Elias and others celebrated the ruling, Uzoma Nkwonta, a lawyer for Nelson's campaign in the case, told the judge in the hearing that a ruling that only extended the deadline by a few days -- which is what Walker ordered -- \"would probably be insufficient.\"\n\nWalker also denied a request on Thursday that would have made it easier for Nelson's campaign to reach out to voters who had mismatched signatures on their ballots. The lawyers had asked for the judge to require the Florida Secretary of State to release the names of people whose ballots had not been counted because their signatures did not match ones on file. Walker, quite directly, took a dim view of that argument and rejected it from the bench.\n\n\"I am not going to be used by either party,\" Walker told the lawyers. \"That's the kind of gamesmanship that would undermine our democracy further.\"\n\nAnd Walker also rejected the Democrats' request to remove the state's deadlines for machine and manual vote recounts on Thursday.\n\n\"This Court must be able to craft a remedy with knowledge that it will not prove futile. It cannot do so on this record,\" Walker wrote. \"This Court does not and will not fashion a remedy in the dark.\"\n\nThe hits kept coming on Friday evening, when Walker denied a motion from lawyers for VoteVets Action Fund and a series of Democratic organizations who were seeking to stop the state of Florida from enforcing the vote-by-mail deadline. The suit argued that voters should not be held responsible for the speed of the US Postal Service and their ballots should be treated similar to ballots mailed from overseas, which have a later deadline.\n\nWalker did not agree, meaning Florida's vote-by-mail deadlines will stand and domestic vote by mail ballots received after Election Day will not be counted.\n\nScott's campaign heralded the decision, arguing that it showed it was \"long past time for Bill Nelson to face the facts: this charade is over, Floridians' votes have been counted multiple times, and Rick Scott is the next Senator from Florida.\"\n\nSome decisions remain for Walker, however, and they could go Nelson's way. VoteVets Action Fund and a series of Democratic organizations urged Walker on Thursday to invalidate Florida law that says domestic mailed ballots must arrive in elections offices by election night. The suit argues that voters should not be held responsible for the speed of the US Postal Service and should be treated similar to overseas mailed ballots, which have a later deadline.\n\nWalker did not indicate on Thursday how he would rule on the matter, but even if he does rule in favor of the Democratic interests on the matter, it is unlikely to be enough vote to close the Nelson's deficit. Supervisor of Elections for Leon County Mark Earley testified during the hearing that the number of domestic mail-in ballots that came in after the deadline this year was 178 in his jurisdiction, which includes Tallahassee. While that number would be larger in more populous counties like Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade, it is highly unlikely to be enough for Nelson.\n\nFor Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida, the path to victory in a recount has closed.\n\nGillum trails former Rep. Ron DeSantis by over 33,000 votes -- a margin that actually went DeSantis' way by one vote during the machine recount.\n\nGillum has not conceded and, in a statement on Thursday, indicated he would not get out of the race.\n\nIn an interview with Pod Save America published Thursday, Gillum said he was in \"fighting shape\" in Tallahassee and was looking forward to getting every vote counted."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Clare Foran, CNN", "title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calls out journalist who called her 'girl' and judged her clothing", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the new Democratic representative-elect from New York, seized on a social media smear to show she's not afraid to call out sexism or define herself on her own terms.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-clothing-criticism-tweet/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181113102948-01-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-file-1113-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:05:45Z", "content": "If I walked into Congress wearing a sack, they would laugh &amp; take a picture of my backside.

But it is something that our caucus is interested in knowing,\" Fudge said. \"I think the biggest issue we discussed was the feeling within the caucus who are feeling left out and left behind.\"\n\nShe said she intends to keep in touch with Pelosi in the coming days, specifically \"exchanging information\" over her desire for a succession plan over the next week on that.\n\nFudge said if Pelosi pledged to serve only one more term as speaker that would satisfy her concerns.\n\n\"Absolutely. No question about it,\" Fudge said.\n\nFudge speculated that neither she nor Pelosi currently has enough support to win the speakership.\n\nFudge has said she had has had an outpouring support from colleagues encouraging her to run. Fudge, who was once the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, has received support for the group's current chairman, Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana. Richmond told CNN Friday he would support Fudge over Pelosi because he's \"closer\" to Fudge.\n\n\"Marcia is my friend, we eat dinner together, my family knows her, and her family knows me,\" Richmond said. \"So, there's nothing that Marcia could run for that I wouldn't support her because she's qualified and I'm not anti-Pelosi, not at all. I consider the speaker to be a very talented speaker, a remarkable speaker, I consider her to be a friend but I'm closer to Marcia, so if Marcia ran that's where I would be.\"\n\nOther Pelosi critics\n\nBesides Fudge, Pelosi met with at least five other newly elected Democrats who have either criticized her or called for new leadership.\n\nVan Drew, who has already announced he is a \"no\" on returning Pelosi to the speaker's job, described his meeting with Pelosi as \"a very pleasant conversation.\" He said they discussed his district and what committees he wanted to be assigned to. He said he does not feel pressure about his opposition to her as speaker. Asked if Pelosi promised him a better committee assignment if he supported her for speaker, he said she did not.\n\nRose said Pelosi did not give him a pitch but quipped that she offered him a Coke and he accepted.\n\n\"Just an honest opportunity for me to introduce myself and talk more,\" he said. \"No pitch. No transactional politics.\"\n\nHe said they talked \"only a little bit\" about the leadership race and that he made himself clear that he sticks to his promises. \"She understands that and it was a great opportunity to talk to her.\"\n\nPelosi has consistently made the case that she's the strongest candidate for speaker and said earlier this week she's confident her Democratic colleagues will elect her in the role. When asked about other Democrats seeking the speakership role earlier this week at a news conference, Pelosi responded \"Come on in, the water's warm.\"\n\nStevens, a Pelosi critic during the campaign, said she spoke about a range of issues important to her Michigan district. She kept the door open to supporting Pelosi.\n\n\"I haven't said no,\" Stevens said.\n\nFollowing her meeting with Pelosi's office, Spanberger said she had a \"wonderful\" discussion with Pelosi about the needs of her district but added she would vote against her on the floor of the House, bringing the total number of Democrats who've done so publicly and recently to 18. She said she would not sign the anti-Pelosi letter, however.\n\n\"I've been very clear about my position and that remains the same,\" she said. \"I will be voting but I will not be voting for her.\"\n\nSeparately, a \"Dear Colleague\" letter passed around by members of the House Democratic caucus dissatisfied with Pelosi says \"we believe more strongly than ever that the time has come for new leadership in our Caucus,\" according to a copy obtained by CNN.\n\nProgressive support for Pelosi\n\nAnother letter that's being circulated on Capitol Hill reveals multiple incoming freshmen -- who were largely noncommittal on the House speaker race during their campaigns --- will in fact support Pelosi\n\nThe letter, obtained by CNN, is still being circulated and so far includes 61 signatures from women incumbents and members-elect. It comes as Pelosi is shoring up support from the progressive base this week with endorsements from large and powerful groups, as well as prominent progressives in Congress \u2014 a move that will put pressure on wayward Democrats to back her bid.\n\nNotably absent from the list are progressive incoming freshmen like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jahana Hayes of Connecticut. Ocasio-Cortez told Vice News this week she was open to supporting Pelosi.\n\nThis story has been updated to include additional comments from lawmakers."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN", "title": "Camp Fire changed her life forever.

It didn't work well more than three decades ago. And it won't work at all now.\n\nIndeed, throughout its checkered history, the implementation of the SDI as a response to enemy missile buildups has only led to the least effective results -- more missiles, less stability, ever greater chances of another step toward an unthinkable third world war.\n\nWord has begun spreading in Washington that Michael Griffin, now 69, and a principal architect of Reagan's \"Star Wars\" program, is back in the Pentagon as \"undersecretary of defense for research and engineering\"-- effectively the chief technology officer for the Defense Department. Though Griffin acknowledges any workable space defense may still be years in the future, he's hoping to revive his dream that has now become Trump's as well. And the world's nightmare.\n\nThis project of a space-based anti-missile system also seems to have become linked with Space Force -- a new branch of the military, alongside the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines, that Trump has ordered to be created without any of the congressional action to enable it. The incentive is not dissimilar to the one that so motivated President Ronald Reagan. \"We have renewed great power competition,\" Griffin told The Washington Post. \"Well, great powers regrettably aim missiles at one another.\"\n\nRegrettably, perhaps. But so far the world has largely managed to avoid going from targeting or aiming to actually launching any such weapons of mass destruction. Any number of international agreements have helped to preserve this uneasy peace, each more or less observed and negotiated in conference rooms and not at gunpoint. Somehow we must manage to negotiate again if we are to preserve the peace and not return to escalating and ever more sophisticated weapons development.\n\nAt the time Reagan's SDI was first proposed, there were only two major nuclear arsenals in the world -- those of the United States and the Soviet Union. Each side believed it had sufficient destructive power to deter the other side from launching its missiles first. They would most certainly be obliterated by a second strike from a wounded, but hardly out of commission, enemy. It was a doctrine known as mutually assured destruction , or MAD.\n\nThen along came SDI -- an anti-missile system that promised to knock out any Soviet capability with impunity. The Kremlin knew it had nothing near the capacity or resources to counter it. So, in October 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev came to the summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, with a unique proposal for Reagan. Each side would destroy its entire nuclear arsenal. But there was one condition. SDI would have to be limited in its pace of development as well -- a gesture, Gorbachev observed, of good faith. Neither side could have any advantage, certainly not one as great as a fully developed SDI\n\nReagan refused. And thus evaporated the world's last and best hope of ridding itself forever of the nuclear curse. Of course there was a trade-off. Reagan's broad pressure on attempting to spend the Soviet Union out of existence did play an important role in that eventual consequence. Today, there is little hope that such a regime change is Trump's goal or is even possible.\n\nThis is not your grandfather's Kremlin. Nor is it your grandfather's Pyongyang, or Tehran for that matter.\n\nThe Russian military machine has already debuted a so-called hypersonic missile , which President Vladimir Putin said last month would be deployed in months. This nuclear-armed \"Avangard\" system, Putin claims, can outrun any anti-missile defense system . \"We are improving our attack systems in response to the construction of a missile defense system by the United States. Some of them are already in service, and some will be supplied in the near future,\" Putin said, posing a direct challenge.\n\nFor the moment, at least, such missiles are intermediate-range weapons threatening Europe. By announcing last month that the United States is pulling out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty -- the 1987 pact that grew directly out of the failure to achieve a comprehensive treaty in Reykjavik -- Trump has added yet another layer of instability.\n\nWhile the 21st-century Kremlin has the capacity to produce a weapon unlike the 20th-century Kremlin of Gorbachev or his predecessors, Kim Jong Un clearly has the ability to produce an intercontinental weapon unlike any his grandfather or father could have hoped to produce when they ruled from Pyongyang.

The gap is designed to snugly fit the tail of the A380, leaving no chilly drafts.\n\nThe airport revealed the new addition in a Facebook post on November 9, captioned \"This butt is our definition of perfect.\" And judging by the 18,000 views the video has racked up, its audience like the big butt, they cannot lie.\n\nFive Lufthansa Airbus A380s have been based at Munich Airport since March, having previously been housed at Frankfurt.\n\nAverage November temperatures here can drop to a biting 2 C (35.6 F) so the gates have been completed not a moment too soon.\n\nThe wide-body double-deck Airbus A380 entered commercial service in 2007. That's a full 25 years after the Munich hangar opened in 1992, confirms Corinna Born, director of international media relations at Munich Airport.\n\nThe hangar may have been built for a different era of air travel, but the airport's novel solution has been turning heads.\n\nThis A380 is one of five Lufthansa superjumbos based at Munich. Courtesy Munich Airport\n\nThe A380 can hold up to 853 passengers in a single-class economy configuration, although most of its operators opt for a more spacious 450 to 500 passenger layout.\n\nAt 79.75 meters, its wingspan is only beaten by the Antonov An-225 Mriya, the world's largest aircraft by weight, length and wingspan.\n\nHowever, the upcoming Stratolaunch, an aircraft project founded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen with the aim of serving the private space industry, will top that, with an incredible wingspan of 117 meters. It's set to make its first flight in 2019.\n\nMunich Airport and Butzbach aren't the only aviation players to be considering ways of accommodating the current generation of mega aircraft."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Christina Maxouris and Andrea Diaz, CNN", "title": "What happened this week (in anything but politics)", "description": "A million-dollar surprise.

GE's stock price has been cut in half this year, on track for its worst performance since 2008.\n\nPrior to 2008, GE Capital was a major growth engine at the company. It provided affordable financing that allowed customers go out and purchase GE's industrial products. But GE Capital came under enormous pressure during the financial crisis, nearly taking down the entire company. And its problems are still haunting GE.\n\n\"Believe me, it wasn't for a lack of trying,\" Immelt said from the World Business Forum in New York. \"It was just hard to do.\"\n\nGE Capital provides financing used by hospitals to purchase CT scan and other equipment made by the health care division.\n\nNow under Culp, GE Capital is unloading this $1.5 billion healthcare portfolio of loans and leases that financed purchases of medical equipment by 1,100 hospitals and 3,600 physician practices and medical centers across the United States. The equipment includes everything from ultrasound and respiratory machines to surgical and lab materials.\n\nAs part of the deal, GE and TIAA Bank entered into a five-year vendor financing agreement for GE Healthcare's US customers. GE said that the leadership and sales force of the healthcare equipment finance team will integrated into GE Healthcare in 2019. GE plans to spin off the profitable health care division in a bid to raise more cash.\n\nJacksonville, Florida, based TIAA Bank is part of TIAA, the retirement giant that was founded by steel magnate Andrew Carnegie in 1918. Today, TIAA manages around $1 trillion of assets."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Chandrika Narayan, CNN", "title": "John Lennon's killer says he feels shame as he's denied parole again", "description": "John Lennon's killer expressed his remorse and contrition for killing the legendary singer almost three decades ago.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/us/john-lennons-killer-denied-parole/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130618165629-01-john-lennon-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:37:21Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) John Lennon's killer expressed his remorse and contrition for killing the legendary singer more than three decades ago.\n\n\"As each year goes by, I feel more and more shame,\" Mark David Chapman told a New York parole board on August 22.

He says \"you have to practice decorum\" at the White House.\n\n\"It's not a big deal,\" Trump told Fox News in an interview on Friday. \"What they said, though, is that we have to create rules and regulations for conduct, etcetera. We're going to write them up. It's not a big deal. If he misbehaves, we'll throw him out or we'll stop the news conference.\"\n\nFriday's ruling by federal judge Timothy J. Kelly was an initial victory for CNN in its lawsuit against Trump and several top aides . The suit alleges that CNN and Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights were violated by last week's suspension of his press pass.\n\nKelly did not rule on the underlying case on Friday. But he granted CNN's request for a temporary restraining order on Fifth Amendment grounds. And he said he believes that CNN and Acosta are likely to prevail in the case overall.\n\n\"Let's go back to work,\" Acosta said in brief comments outside the courthouse.\n\nLater in the day he arrived at the White House and received his Secret Service \"hard pass,\" the pass that was taken from him nine days ago.\n\nHe is expected to appear on CNN for one of his usual live shots on Friday evening.\n\nCNN v. Trump is an important test of press freedom in the US. Kelly, seemingly well aware of the high stakes, read his written opinion from the bench for nearly 20 minutes Friday morning. He sided with CNN on the basis of the suit's Fifth Amendment claims, saying the White House did not provide Acosta with the due process required to legally revoke his press pass.\n\nHe left open the possibility that the White House could seek to revoke Acosta's pass again if it provided due process.\n\nThat may be why Trump is talking about implementing \"rules.\"\n\nKelly went to great lengths to explain what his decision meant \u2014 and what it didn't mean \u2014 to the attentive audience. He emphasized the \"very limited\" nature of the ruling. He said that while he may not agree with the underlying case law that CNN's argument was based on, he had to follow it. \"I've read the case closely,\" he said. \"Whether it's what I agree with, that's a different story. But I must apply precedent as I see it.\"\n\nKelly criticized last week's blacklisting of Acosta as \"shrouded in mystery,\" noting that the Justice Department lawyer in the case couldn't even say who ordered the decision.\n\nBut he also said that he was not making a judgment on the First Amendment claims that CNN and Acosta have made.\n\nDespite that, Sanders said in her statement, \"Today, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House.\"\n\nThe judge did not make that clear.\n\nBut he did note that Sanders' initial claim that Acosta had inappropriately touched a White House intern was \"likely untrue\" and \"partly based on evidence of questionable accuracy.\" Acosta held onto a microphone when an intern tried to take it away during a presidential news conference last week. Later that day, the correspondent's access to the White House was suspended.\n\nKelly noted that Trump may never call on Acosta again. But that's not relevant to this decision, he said. There needs to be due process regarding the pass.\n\nKelly was appointed to the bench by Trump last year, and confirmed with bipartisan support in the Senate. CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the ruling \"strikes me as an extremely savvy and wise resolution of this case.\"\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Sanders, one of the six defendants in the case, did not specify whether the administration would continue to fight the lawsuit in court. The legal battle may continue for months.\n\nBut Sanders said in a statement that \"we will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House.\"\n\nTrump said the same thing during a Q&A with reporters in the Oval Office.\n\n\"People have to behave,\" he said, when asked about the administration's defeat in court.\n\n\"If they,\" meaning reporters like Acosta, \"don't listen to the rules and regulations, we'll end up back in court and we'll win. But more importantly, we'll just leave,\" meaning, stop taking questions from the press. \"And then you won't be very happy. Because we do get good ratings.\"\n\nTed Boutrous, one of the outside lawyers representing CNN in the case, said in an interview that the network is open to a resolution that could avoid further legal action.\n\n\"We want to just simply move forward and let CNN and Jim Acosta gather news and report it,\" Boutrous said.\n\nBut what if the administration tries to implement intense restrictions on the press corps, or tries to revoke other press passes?\n\n\"I think, you know, we're ready to litigate as long as we have to to protect these First Amendment rights, to ask the court to declare rules of the road going forward,\" Boutrous said.\n\nIn a statement about the ruling, CNN said, \"We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days. Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\"\n\nNumerous press freedom advocacy groups also cheered the ruling.\n\n\"Today, a major precedent was set for the future of a free press. It is a win for one reporter, but most importantly a win for the Constitution and the enduring freedoms it grants us all,\" the Georgetown Law's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection said.\n\nAnd the ACLU said \"the White House surely hoped that expelling a reporter would deter forceful questioning, but the court's ruling will have the opposite effect.\"\n\nMost of the country's major news organizations have supported CNN's lawsuit , recognizing that the White House may try to ban other reporters in the future.\n\nCNN has asked the court for \"permanent relief,\" meaning a declaration from the judge that Trump's revocation of Acosta's press pass was unconstitutional. This legal conclusion could protect other reporters from retaliation by the administration.\n\nBut the judge will rule on all of that later. Further hearings are likely to take place in the next few weeks, according to CNN's lawyers.\n\nThe White House took the unprecedented step of suspending Acosta's access after he had a combative exchange with Trump at last week's post-midterms press conference. CNN privately sought a resolution for several days before filing suit on Tuesday.\n\nThe defendants include Trump, Sanders, and chief of staff John Kelly.\n\nJudge Kelly heard oral arguments from both sides on Wednesday afternoon. Kelly asked tough questions of both sides, drilling particularly deep into some of CNN's arguments.\n\nThen he said he would issue a ruling Thursday afternoon. He later postponed it until Friday morning , leaving both sides wondering about the reason for the delay.\n\nIn public, the White House continued to argue that Acosta deserves to be blacklisted because he was too aggressive at the press conference.\n\nSpeaking with Robert Costa at a Washington Post Live event on Thursday, White House communications official Mercedes Schlapp said press conferences have a \"certain decorum,\" and suggested that Acosta violated that. \"In that particular incident, we weren't going to tolerate the bad behavior of this one reporter,\" she said. Schlapp repeated the \"bad behavior\" claim several times.\n\nWhen Costa asked if the White House is considering yanking other press passes. Schlapp said \"I'm not going to get into any internal deliberations that are happening.\"\n\nIn court on Wednesday, Justice Department lawyer James Burnham argued that the Trump White House has the legal right to kick out any reporter at any time for any reason \u2014 a position that is a dramatic break from decades of tradition.\n\nWhile responding to a hypothetical from Kelly, Burnham said that it would be perfectly legal for the White House to revoke a journalist's press pass if it didn't agree with their reporting. \"As a matter of law... yes,\" he said.\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association \u2014 which represents reporters from scores of different outlets \u2014 said the government's stance is \"wrong\" and \"dangerous.\"\n\n\"Simply stated,\" the association's lawyers wrote in a brief on Thursday, \"if the President were to have the absolute discretion to strip a correspondent of a hard pass, the chilling effect would be severe and the First Amendment protections afforded journalists to gather and report news on the activities on the President would be largely eviscerated.\"\n\nOn Friday the correspondents' association welcomed Kelly's ruling and said \"we thank all of the news outlets and individual reporters who stood up in recent days for the vital role a free and independent news media plays in our republic.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Charles Arthur", "title": "It's time to admit we are addicted to Facebook -- and that it might be toxic", "description": "Poor Facebook.

She always talked about one day returning to engineering. But over time, she says that faith in her abilities began to wane.\n\n\"I always said 'I can always go back to engineering. I can never get time back with my kids' \u2014 but as time went on, I didn't believe that as much,\" she says. \"I didn't want to go out and sell myself as a potential program manager or an engineer, because I wasn't convinced [of my abilities].\"\n\nBut one day scrolling through Facebook, she came across a link to Take 2 \u2014 the General Motors career re-entry program aimed at recruiting more experienced employees back to the workforce after they've taken a long break. Fleck talked with her family, touched up her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and sent in her application.\n\nThe 12-week program was her ideal transition back into the workforce. She brushed up on her engineering education, caught up on technological changes and \u2014 most importantly, she says \u2014 learned how to start seeing her \"break\" as another chapter in her career journey.\n\n\"I feel like I'm constantly dusting off cobwebs and I feel consciously incompetent in many areas,\" Fleck says. \"I know I don't know a lot of stuff \u2014 but I'm willing to learn.\"\n\nA diversity of experience\n\nCareer reentry programs \u2014 or \"returnships\" as they're sometimes called \u2014 offer women and men an opportunity to \"try out\" the big transition back into the workforce. Workers that have taken years, or even decades off from full-time work, either to raise children, help with elderly relatives, or deal with personal health issues, have been able to gradually return to successful careers at companies like IBM, Goldman Sachs, General Motors and others.\n\nExtended time away from a career means employees miss out on training and market developments, but it also means they're gaining other skills and bringing some needed diversity to the existing workforce, says Megan Hogan, vice president and head of diversity recruiting at Goldman Sachs.\n\n\"Definitely it's a diversity program,\" she says. \"Returnships fit squarely in my purview. It's about diversity of experience.\"\n\nLori Taylor, a participant in Goldman Sach's returnship program and now a vice president in the bank's risk division, says the opportunity felt like a chance to \"hit the ground running\" after six and a half years away from the workforce.\n\n\"To be able to come in and realize my skills, experience and training were still relevant, that what I knew was still very applicable \u2014 it made that transition really easy,\" she says. \"It helped with confidence, I would say, and feeling like I was able to contribute right away.\"\n\nIn order to qualify for both the Goldman Program and GM's Take 2, participants have to have been away from the workforce for at least two years. Some return to the work they were doing before their breaks, but others train for entirely new careers in other fields, so previous experience is not necessary.\n\nFleck says the 12-week program at GM taught her to see her time away from her career in a different light. Her engineering skills hadn't vanished, and in fact, her time as a full-time mom even expanded her skillset.\n\n\"It can be overwhelming with the number of issues, the number of emails across my screen,\" Fleck says. \"But with raising kids and volunteering and working, you're constantly bombarded with different issues, and you need to be able to bounce back and forth between different issues. So I think my experience both as a parent and working to get stuff done at home, it helps me manage stuff better.\"\n\nA diversity of skill\n\nBut women and men reentering the workforce may still battle stereotypes about their age, their abilities or the length of their break, says Lauren Rikleen, president of the Rikleen Institute for Strategic Leadership.\n\n\"All the old stereotypes persist: 'You've been out of the workplace a few years and you're not going to be able to catch on or be as quick' ... the biggest issue for me is that it discounts the importance of wisdom,\" Rikleen says. \"Wisdom is something you only get with age and experience, and no matter how smart you are in college or your early jobs, the wisdom from working through problems and hardships and failures and is an invaluable component in the workplace, and should be thought of as a critical part of any team.\"\n\nFleck and Taylor both say they initially worried about catching up with the technological changes that now populate offices.\n\n\"The computer and Skype and the conference calls and the video systems \u2014 I was worried every time I flubbed something up they'd say 'Oh, you can't do this,'\" Fleck says.\n\nBut as more experienced workers introduce more age diversity into the workforce, they also bring maturity and some much-needed institutional knowledge. If anything, sometimes these returning workers have skills that are even rarer among younger employees, interns and recent college graduates, says Scott Klott, talent acquisition lead at General Motors.\n\nHe points out that some of GM's IT systems still run on a mainframe, a specialty that's harder and harder to find.\n\n\"You don't get many college grads who say 'I want to be a professional in the mainframe space,'\" he says. \"But especially someone who has been a mainframe developer who took time off, they're coming back and saying 'Who really wants a mainframe developer? My skills are antiquated. Who wants me?' and the answer is 'We do! You're really hard to find. We need your talent.'\"\n\nReturning employees are bringing something else valuable: maturity and perspective.\n\nIn the first part of her career, Fleck says she really struggled to be taken seriously as a female engineer. She remembers having to \"route\" ideas through men in order for them to be accepted.\n\n\"If I come up with questions and ideas, people seem to take me more seriously,\" she says of her job now. \"I think it's a combination: people have changed, but also I have more confidence in me, and it comes across.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Paula Bravo Medina", "title": "La caravana est\u00e1 a apenas pasos de EE.UU., pero cruzar legalmente podr\u00eda tardar semanas", "description": "Grandes grupos de migrantes que caminaron a trav\u00e9s de M\u00e9xico y esperan buscar asilo en los Estados Unidos est\u00e1n comenzando a llegar a la ciudad fronteriza de Tijuana.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!", "fulltext": "On her second day in Washington, Ocasio-Cortez reportedly clashed with New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone , the incoming chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, over the best approach to addressing climate issues. (Ocasio-Cortez called the Politico report on her back-and-forth with Pallone \"completely false,\" adding: \"I never even have a direct interaction with him today.\")\n\nIn those first 48 hours in Washington -- and even before she is formally sworn in as a congresswoman -- two things became readily apparent about Ocasio-Cortez:\n\n1) Because of her national stardom derived from her stunning upset primary victory over Rep. Joe Crowley, D-New York, everything she does will be watched and scrutinized to death. (And apparently everything she wears too. On Thursday, a media reporter for the Washington Examiner tweeted a picture of Ocasio-Cortez in which she is wearing a business suit with the caption \"that jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles.\" His tweet provoked, um, quite the reaction on the Internet .)\n\n2) Unlike most new members if Congress who quickly seek to adapt themselves to Washington's ways in hopes of ingratiating themselves to leaders and climbing the leadership ladder, Ocasio-Cortez represents something very different: Her roots are in activism, not politics. And she seems to have very little concern as to how her willingness to buck the Way Things Are Done Around Here will have on her career in Congress.\n\n\"There's so many people that know that we're going into the lion's den, even within the party,\" Ocasio-Cortez told The New York Times' Azi Paybarah in a insightful profile of her that ran earlier this month. She added, channeling messages that she gets from constituents: \"We know how much pressure you're going to be under even from within your own party. We know you're going to be under pressure to fall in line. Just please don't do it.\"\n\nSee also: Her Twitter feed, which she's used strategically to stir the pot ever since her election.\n\nWhat's fascinating about the arrival of Ocasio-Cortez in Washington is how it mimics what happened to the Republican Party following the 2010 election that put the GOP back into the House majority. When the new freshman class of Republicans arrived in Washington in late 2010/early 2011, it quickly became clear that this tea party-fueled group was not planning to play nice with the party leadership -- most notably Speaker John Boehner. While Boehner started his speakership downplaying any potential problems from the rump group, it quickly became clear that he had badly underestimated his ability to control a bloc of legislators more loyal to the tea party activists who had propelled them to Congress than to the old leadership structure that awaited them once they got there. Boehner was eventually driven from the speakership in the fall of 2015, unable and unwilling to navigate the demands of a wing of his party that viewed any compromise as capitulation\n\nBut there's no question that Ocasio-Cortez is the highest-profile of this new generation of Democrats unwilling to simply go along to get along with the old guard within her party. As the coverage of Ocasio-Cortez's first 48 hours in Washington suggests, she is no normal freshman member of Congress -- whether by dint of her age (she's the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at 29) or the nature of how she got to where she is (a historic upset over a member of the Democratic leadership.)\n\nAnd so, Ocasio-Cortez represents both challenge and opportunity for Democrats in Washington. She has the capacity to become an even bigger national star for a party whose leaders in Congress are both a) old and b) not terribly popular. But Ocasio-Cortez is making clear -- in word and deed -- that she's not content to play the Washington game -- make as few waves as possible, ingratiate yourself to leadership and hope they reward you. She's playing a different kind of game -- and outside of Washington one -- that, without question poses a very real threat to the staid status quo of the DC Democratic establishment."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Sophie Jeong and Caroline Kelly, CNN", "title": "North Korea deports US citizen detained since October, state media reports", "description": "North Korea deported a US citizen who was detained last month after he \"illegally entered our country through the border between North Korea and China,\" the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Friday.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/politics/north-korea-deports-detained-u-s-citizen/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181116104952-north-korea-kim-jong-un-test-1611-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:41:39Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) North Korea deported a US citizen who was detained last month after he \"illegally entered our country through the border between North Korea and China,\" the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Friday.\n\nKCNA reports the US citizen, identified as Bruce Byron Lowrance, illegally entered North Korea on October 16 and testified that he did so.

She said yes... Hide Caption 9 of 9\n\nHawaiian paradise\n\nThe \"crazy\" day rapidly improved for Ryf when she got out of the water and no longer needed her arms as much.\n\nShe set a bike course record to make up the 10-minute deficit and extended her lead during an impressive run. Her efforts culminated in a new course record of eight hours and 26 minutes.\n\nKailua-Kona, Hawaii, has hosted the annual Ironman World Championships for the last 40 years and the event has a special place in Ryf's heart.\n\nSince winning her maiden title in 2015, the Swiss is unbeaten on the course.\n\nAs a result, she's developed a spiritual bond with the island and is already looking forward to returning next year.\n\n\"Whenever I go back to Kona, it will give me goosebumps,\" she said.\n\nRyf says the Hawaiian course has changed her life.\n\n'Giving up isn't an option'\n\nRyf struggles to explain what makes her better than everyone else. The truth is, it's a number of things.\n\nShe has a pragmatic approach to everything she does, whether that be training, eating or competition.\n\nShe has an incredible mentality which has helped her push through the pain barrier on countless occasions and remain positive throughout her glittering career.\n\n\"If giving up isn't an option, you don't have to think about it,\" she said. \"You then just need to figure out how to keep going.\n\n\"The body only does what the mind tells it to do. I told myself I wouldn't give up and that I'd be the champion.\"\n\nRyf made up valuable time with a bike-course record in Hawaii.\n\n'The longer stuff'\n\nRyf comes from an active family. Her father was a rock climber and her mother used to run marathons.\n\nShe remains eternally grateful for their support in the early stages of her career, even though she admits to never having aspirations of being world champion.\n\nRyf started swimming and running when she was nine years old and initially saw training as just a chance to see her friends.\n\nThings started to become a little more serious when she joined a triathlon club at 13.\n\n\"I then started to enjoy improving and that's still the same. I enjoy that feeling when your body gets stronger and fitter,\" she said.\n\nThe young triathlete flourished, and she was selected to represent Switzerland in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, finishing seventh over the Games distance of 0.93 miles of swimming, 24.8 miles on the bike and a 6.2-mile run .\n\nA second Summer Olympics followed four years later but Ryf was always drawn to the \"longer stuff.\"\n\nRyf won her first Ironman World Championship in 2015.\n\nThe grueling regime\n\nUnder the guidance of current coach Brett Sutton, Ryf stepped up to Ironman competitions. The pair haven't looked back since.\n\nEnjoying training is another factor behind her rise to the top of the sport.\n\nRyf usually dedicates herself to three sessions a day, the first starting at 7 a.m. on an empty stomach.\n\nShe then eats breakfast and rests before two more grueling sessions at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nHow Daniela Ryf broke the course record: 2.4-mile swim: 00:57:27\n\n112-mile bike: 4:26:07\n\n26.2 run: 2:57:05\n\nTotal 140.6-miles: 8:26:18\n\nShe admits it can be \"boring\" but is able to switch around the training sessions to keep her interested.\n\nRyf's love for training is borne from her curiosity. It's what drives her to continue training during the off season.\n\n\"It gives me something that makes me feel happy. I find it inspiring to see how your body gets stronger and fitter,\" she says.\n\nRyf also enjoys changing the location of her base.\n\nAhead of the success last month, she spent three months in the Swiss mountains before an additional four weeks training in the heat of Maui, Hawaii.\n\nBut no matter where she trains, she always aims to be efficient.\n\n\"It's not about how hard you train but how well you train,\" she said. \"If you're prepared well, then you will be able to cope with the challenges in the race.\"\n\nThe Swiss athlete usually trains three times a day. The first session starting at 7am.\n\nChocolate and burgers\n\nShe applies a similarly pragmatic approach to her diet. Ryf uses huge amounts of energy on a daily basis, and how she eats is vital for refueling her body but also how she feels emotionally.\n\n\"I think it's about having that balance,\" she says. \"Sometimes I eat chocolate or a burger that makes me feel good. I don't have to restrict myself too much.\"\n\nUnlike Patrick Lange , the winner of the men's division in this year's Ironman World Championships, Ryf is not a vegetarian. She believes meat, as well as fruit and vegetables, is important for her recovery.\n\n\"I try to keep it balanced which makes me the happiest. If you're happy, you're more balanced and your performance is better,\" she said.\n\nRyf is enjoying some downtime after yet another successful season but is already looking ahead to defending her title next year.\n\n\"It's pretty clear that I want to go back, it's not really a question,\" she said. \"I've still got lots in me and I want to show more.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Brian Lowry, CNN", "title": "'Dirty John' makes messy leap from pod to screen", "description": "'Dirty John' review: Connie Britton, Eric Bana star as Los Angeles Times true-crime podcast makes the messy leap to Bravo", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/entertainment/dirty-john-review/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115140832-dirty-john-connie-britton-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:18:33Z", "content": "(CNN) Traditional print outlets are understandably starry-eyed about finding new ways to cash in on their content, compensating for a dwindling business model.

A date for the elections is expected to be decided on Sunday following a meeting of the coalition party heads.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Interior Minister Aryeh Deri also called for early elections.\n\nBennett's withdrawal from the coalition would leave Netanyahu without the minimum 61 seats needed to govern, making elections inevitable and ending a government that lasted nearly four years.\n\nA spokesman for Netanyahu's Likud party said in a statement after the meeting with Bennett that the Prime Minister would try to stabilize his government on Sunday at the weekly cabinet meeting.\n\n\"At the beginning of the week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold conversations with the heads of the coalitions, and he relies on the ministers' responsibility not to make a historic mistake in toppling a right-wing government,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Prime Minister Netanyahu stressed that it's important to make every effort in order to preserve the right-wing government and not to repeat the historical mistake of 1992 when a right-wing government was toppled, raised the left to power and brought the Oslo disaster upon Israel.\"\n\nA statement released a short time later said Netanyahu had begun those conversations Friday afternoon.\n\nNetanyahu's troubles began Wednesday when Liberman, his hardline Defense Minister, announced his resignation. Liberman had openly opposed a ceasefire reached with Gaza one day earlier that ended the worst 24 hours of fighting since the 2014 war, advocating instead for a harsher blow against Hamas, the militant group that controls the coastal enclave. Liberman called the ceasefire \"a capitulation to terror.\"\n\nFrom Monday night to Tuesday afternoon, Gaza militants fired some 400 rockets into Israel, while the Israeli military struck more than 100 targets inside Gaza.\n\nLiberman didn't have enough seats to topple the government on his own, but his withdrawal left Netanyahu with a bare minimum 61-seat coalition, allowing other parties to make demands of the Israeli leader.\n\nThe sudden vacancy allowed Bennett, leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, to demand the defense portfolio, promising to quit the government if he didn't get it.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Kahlon, the Finance Minister, met with Netanyahu and said it was time to call early elections.\n\nIn a statement released after the meeting, Kahlon said, \"The stability required at this time is not achievable in the present situation, and therefore the responsible act is the establishment of a new, strong and stable government.\"\n\nDeri, the Interior Minister, echoed his call, increasing pressure on Netanyahu to dissolve the government.\n\nThe political turbulence comes as Netanyahu faces criminal investigations that have hit him and his inner circle. Israeli police say they have enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in two separate investigations. He was questioned as a suspect in a third investigation. Netanyahu has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence, often employing the phrase \"There will be nothing because there is nothing.\"\n\nThe criminal investigations have barely damaged the Prime Minister's standing in the polls or his popularity. Polls have repeatedly projected that Netanyahu's Likud party would increase its number of seats if early elections are held.\n\nBut the crisis may pose a new challenge for the Israeli leader, since it appears he is being led to call early elections, instead of calling them on his own.\n\nBy law, the government must choose an election date within three to five months, making March or May the most likely time for elections.

The cause of the fire has yet to be determined. But PG&E ( PCG ) disclosed in a regulatory filing earlier this week that it \"experienced an outage\" on a transmission line just 15 minutes before the Camp Fire broke out.\n\nThat news led to a more than 60% plunge in the stock in the past week as investors worried that the utility did not have the financial resources to cover legal liabilities tied to the fire.\n\nLawyers representing victims of the fire have already filed two class action lawsuits against PG&E. And Fitch Ratings downgraded PG&E's credit rating Friday, citing potential for PG&E to pay huge liabilities. If PG&E is found to have sparked the wildfires, Fitch said it could downgrade its stock several more notches into \"junk\" territory.\n\nBut the stock was up nearly 40% Friday after the president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) suggested that the state would work with PG&E to ensure that it would not be permanently crippled by lawsuits.\n\n\"An essential component of providing safe electrical service is the financial wherewithal to carry out safety measures,\" said CPUC president Michael Picker in a statement.\n\nPicker added that as a result of a new law signed by California governor Jerry Brown last year, the CPUC is now required to consider a utility's finances when determining the maximum amount it can pay without harming customers when evaluating damages caused by wildfires.\n\nAs part of the bill that Brown signed, PG&E will now be able to issue bonds backed by surcharges from its customers. Those bonds will help pay for damages tied to deadly California wildfires in October 2017 caused by faulty PG&E equipment.\n\nThe bill allows for the possibility that utilities could issue similar bonds for future fires, but that is not guaranteed.\n\nIn a separate interview with Bloomberg late Thursday, Picker said \"it's not good policy to have utilities unable to finance the services and infrastructure the state of California needs. They have to have stability and economic support to get the dollars they need right now.\"\n\nEven after Friday's big rally, PG&E is still more than 45% below where it was trading the day before the fire started.\n\nPG&E has previously indicated that it renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfire events for an amount of approximately $1.4 billion that covers the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019.\n\nBut the estimated damages are rising rapidly. Moody's said earlier this week that it could cost up to $6.8 billion, while Citigroup estimates the damages could be as high as $15 billion.\n\nThe utility's total market value is now below $15 billion though, and PG&E said in its filing that it currently has just $3.46 billion in cash after borrowing from an existing revolving credit line.\n\nThat's why it will be critical for the state of California to assist PG&E if it is found liable for the Camp Fire.\n\n\"We agree with CPUC President Picker's statement that an essential component of providing safe electrical service is long-term financial stability,\" PG&E said in a statement. \"Access to affordable capital is critical to carrying out safety measures and meeting California's bold clean energy goals.\"\n\nCNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this story"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Why a dad held on to this Christmas tree for 44 years", "description": "A Wisconsin man is honoring his late father by spending one last Christmas with the Christmas tree his father erected 44 years ago when his sons went off to war in 1974.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2018/11/14/44-year-old-christmas-tree-wisconsin-newsource-orig.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181116093417-44-year-old-christmas-tree-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:54:28Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Apr\u00e8s-ski activities may be a welcome respite after a full the day on the mountain, but to the ski enthusiast, they're ultimately just what comes after the main event.\n\nResorts in the United States and Canada can hold their own against Europe's most elite ski areas. From heli-skiing to uphill climbing to private backcountry tours, here are eight of the best destinations for skiers who really care about skiing.\n\nTelluride Ski Resort is one of two ski resorts in Colorado to offer heli-skiing. Telluride Ski Resort\n\nTelluride Ski Resort\n\nOnce a Victorian mining home, Telluride is now home to one of Colorado's swankiest ski areas. It's about as difficult to get to as one might expect of a jet-setting locale -- and worth the trek.\n\nWith 41% of its terrain deemed advanced territory (that leaves 23% for beginners and 36% for intermediate level), stellar skiers will have plenty to keep them on the mountain all day. Skiers and riders looking to elevate their snow adventure can book a heli-ski trip and descend upon untouched, virgin snow.\n\nTelluride is just one of two resorts in Colorado to offer heli-skiing, but it's not the only way to experience fresh powder on this part of the Rockies.\n\nBlack Iron Bowl is an area of the resort that's accessed via lift and hike. Once reached, it offers advanced skiers and boarders untracked, challenging terrain. Tucking into a locally sourced pork chop and craft beer at Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery is a recommended way to finish the day.\n\nTelluride Ski Resort 565 Mountain Village Blvd, Telluride, CO 81435, (866) 754-8355\n\nSilverton Mountain\n\nAlthough there are dozens of ski areas in Colorado, home to most of the southern Rocky Mountains, only two offer heli-sking: Telluride and Silverton. Silverton is \"unique\" in its single-ride offering, says Chris Linsmayer, public affairs director at Colorado Ski Country USA. Instead of renting a helicopter for the whole day or multiple days, newbie heli-skiers can purchase one ride for as little as $39.\n\nSilverton, an advanced-only ski region in Colorado, wants to make heli-skiing accessible with single-ride purchases available for curious skiers and boarders. Silverton Mountain\n\nThis price point makes a typically pricey venture accessible and low-risk, at least in terms of the financial obligation.\n\nBut if hopping out of a helicopter and heading down a piece of what Linsmayer says is the \"highest and steepest ski area in all of North America\" doesn't appeal, there are plenty of other ways for the advanced skier to appreciate Silverton.\n\nThe website calls the area \"all thrills no frills,\" so there is little question as to what the mountain offers, and beginners may want to stick with the apr\u00e8s options. Avalanche Brewing Company and Golden Block Brewery help cement Colorado's solid reputation among beer lovers.\n\nSilverton Mountain 6226 State Hwy 110, Silverton, CO 81433, (970) 387-5706\n\nPark City Mountain\n\nA charming, quintessential ski town if there ever was one, Park City, Utah, offers world-class skiing for all levels and plenty to see and do off the slopes too.\n\nIn 2015, Park City joined forces with nearby Canyons Resort to form the unified Park City Mountain Resort. The merger made Park City Resort the largest single ski and snowboard resort in the United States. The resorts make up over 7,300 acres with 348 trails and 14 lifts between the two.\n\nYou won't find heli-skiing in this part of the Rocky Mountains, but thrill seekers can pair up with a professional guide who'll take participants on a journey to discover the best runs on the mountain.\n\nThe Peak-to-Peak Guided Mountain Tour takes skiers and riders to areas with the best conditions (otherwise known as soft, powdery snow that seemingly goes on forever). And the Silver to Slopes Historic Mining Tour is available to intermediate and above skiers. It's a chance to experience the fine slopes of Utah while learning about the region's mining history.\n\nPark City Mountain 1345 Lowell Ave, Park City, UT 84060, (435) 649-8111\n\nRelated content What a million-dollar ski vacation looks like\n\nPowder Mountain\n\nAverage snowfall at this Utah resort is 500 inches. That's snow sitting on over 8,464 skiable acres with a total of 164 runs. Folks at Powder Mountain, who endearingly call it \"Pow Mow,\" are so enamored by the area's natural snow (and low ice factor) that they even have a name for it: creamy corduroy.\n\nPowder Mountain is so proud of its natural snow that it even has a name for it: creamy corduroy. With an average snowfall of 500 inches per year, that's a lot of creamy corduroy to experience. Powder Mountain\n\nWhile other resorts boast of their advanced snow-making technology, Powder Mountain brags about, well, not needing to make snow. Ski Utah's tagline is \"The Greatest Snow on Earth,\" and visitors need only travel 55 miles from the Salt Lake City Airport to experience the unparalleled powder of these Rockies.\n\nPow Mow limits the number of lift tickets sold per day to just 1,500 to preserve the skier experience and prevent crowding on those pristine slopes. Visitors might encounter crowds at the post-ski live music shows at Powder Mountain Powder Keg , but making friends is easy when you're swapping shredding stories.\n\nPowder Mountain 6965 E Powder Mountain Rd, Eden, UT 84310, (801) 745-3772\n\nMammoth Mountain\n\nThe highest ski resort in California, Mammoth is known for getting heaps of snow each season -- 400 inches average. You won't find heli-skiing here, but an alternative for the hardcore fitness fanatic is skipping the chairlift and walking up a very big hill.\n\nThis season, Mammoth is excited about the launch of their uphill policy, which will allow skiers and snowboarders a chance to experience the entire mountain in a new way.\n\nSkiers put something called climbing skins on the bottom of their skis, and the against-the-grain texture of the skins helps the climber ascend the mountain.\n\nIt's an \"option for guests who just want to get a really good workout in,\" says Mammoth Mountain Marketing Manager Gabe Taylor. And it's a good way to see the backcountry terrain when the weather isn't cooperating and lifts may be temporarily closed, Taylor says.\n\nMammoth Mountain 10001 Minaret Road Mammoth Lakes, CA 93546, 760-934-0745\n\nMammoth Mountain is California's highest ski resort, and it typically receives heaps of snow each year. Mammoth Mountain\n\nWhistler Blackcomb\n\nBetween the two mountains -- Whistler and Blackcomb -- there are 200 runs and 16 alpine bowls to make up over 8,000 acres of terrain. This part of the Coast Mountains in Canada's British Columbia is considered the largest ski area in North America.\n\nOf note this year is a new 10-passenger Blackcomb Gondola, which together with PEAK 2 PEAK Gondola and Whistler Village Gondola will form \"the first three-gondola connection in the world,\" says Mary Zinck, a manager for Tourism Whistler.\n\nEasier-to-access mountaintops mean more opportunity to explore as much of the expansive region as possible, but for a truly extreme skiing experience, there's the backcountry. Availability of tickets to access this typically unmarked and unpatrolled virgin snow is determined by the ski patrol.\n\nWould-be backcountry skiers can wait out unfavorable conditions in the Squamish Lilwat Cultural Centre , a First Nations museum and cultural center celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.\n\nWhistler Blackcomb 4545 Blackcomb Way, Whistler, BC V0N 1B4, Canada (800)-766-0449\n\nRelated content From tattoos to tall trees: Indigenous culture in Vancouver\n\nRED Mountain Resort\n\nRED Mountain in Rossland, British Columbia boasts unspoiled, wide-open groomed runs in a serene setting. Red Cat Mountain\n\nLocated in Rossland, British Columbia, Red Mountain considers itself Western Canada's original ski destination. The resort area offers up to 4,200 acres of skiing, and \"unspoiled\" is a word RED Mountain likes to use to describe its slopes. There's some beginner territory here, but most of the mountain caters to expert, advanced and intermediate levels.\n\nBut if standard chairlifts up to the summit don't seem extreme enough, there are cat and heli-skiing opportunities. Like heli-skiing, cat-skiing takes skiers and riders out to areas of undiscovered, untouched powder, often in the mountain's backcountry.\n\nSince snowcats, a type of snow vehicle, are used to access the territory, it's a more budget-friendly option than taking a helicopter up to the top.\n\nAt the end of a rigorous day of cat-skiing, which can mean vertically traversing up to 18,000 feet per day, guests could do worse things than curl up in a booth in The Josie Hotel's Velvet Restaurant & Lounge . Its soulful, seasonal food offerings in a cozy setting make for a quintessential apr\u00e8s-ski.\n\nRED Mountain Resort 4300 Red Mountain Rd, Rossland, British Columbia, Canada\n\nBig Sky Resort\n\nWhile Montana's most elite resort doesn't offer heli-skiing, it has plenty on deck for adventurous skiiers and riders and has advanced technology to boot.\n\nYou may not be able to take a helicopter to the top of the mountain, but beginning next month, you can board the Ramcharger 8. This high-speed lift includes heated seats and a weather-proof bubble. It'll help skiers and snowboarders do more runs, if, you know, counting ski runs per day is your thing.\n\nA view of the summit of Lone Peak, a 11,166-foot peak at Montana's Big Sky Resort. Only a limited number of skiers can ski off the peak at one time. Michel Tallichet\n\nExperienced skiers and riders won't want to miss Lone Peak, the iconic peak of Big Sky. The resort limits the number of skiers who can ski off the 11,166-foot peak at a time making this a unique feature of the resort. It is the closest thing Montana has to heli-skiing, says Stacie Mesuda, public relations manager for Big Sky Resort.\n\nIt's worth noting that the longest run off of Lone Peak is six miles, and you're bound to find plenty of powder stashes in this part of the Northern American Rockies. A six-mile downhill run on skis or a board would seem to merit a massage, and Solace Spa & Salon can help tailor one to your individual needs."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Ryan Nobles, CNN", "title": "Florida recount Day 7: State of Play", "description": "Florida's recount is now in Day 7.

It is, without a doubt, a disappointment for the people of Florida that three counties could not complete the automatic machine recount in a timely fashion. Broward County, the second largest county in Florida, submitted their results two minutes late. The deadline is the deadline, and THE RECOUNT OF their 700,000 votes wasn't accepted. Neither were the results in Palm Beach County, which simply couldn't get the work done. Broken machines and a slow start doomed this county from the beginning. And in a surprise, Hillsborough County, which had unexpected power outages at their elections center, could not submit their numbers in time. All three counties were forced to revert to the numbers they posted on Saturday. In the grand scheme of things, it likely doesn't impact the overall vote totals. But it demonstrates an overall problem in Florida's voting system, and it opens the door to more litigation. It is pretty clear that more people voted for Gov. Rick Scott for the US Senate and former Rep. Ron DeSantis in the governor's race, and that really has nothing to do with these problems. However, Florida should still take steps to learn from this process. This is quite clearly a state where close elections happen often.\n\nScott pressing for a concession\n\nScott would like to get on with his life. The best way to do that is for his opponent, Sen. Bill Nelson, to declare this game over. From the beginning, the hope of this race flipping was slim. With each passing day, the path to victory gets smaller. The machine recount numbers actually improved Scott's position, and the Democrats are either losing their legal challenges or not winning them convincingly. With the odds stacked against him, Nelson doesn't have too many more options. Like Andrew Gillum in the governor's race, he could admit that he can't win, but still push to get all the votes counted. That would allow an orderly transition to begin. That doesn't appear to be in the immediate offing, but it seems with each passing moment we are getting a little bit closer.\n\nWhat's up with Gillum?\n\nIt is now abundantly clear that Gillum lost the race for governor. The end of machine recount did not move the needle much, and as a result, they will stop counting ballots in his race. Despite this reality, Gillum has still not conceded. He put out a statement shortly after the recount ended that made it clear he wants all the votes counted. Democrats, acknowledge that the race is over, but that doesn't mean they want the counting to stop. They view it as a scandal of real proportion that, in their view, not every vote is being counted. Gillum continues to want to be a part of the public conversation. He is giving high-profile speeches and podcast interviews and still pushing to make sure those votes are counted. That push comes even with the knowledge that it is likely that even if every single one of those votes were counted, he would still not become the governor of Florida.\n\nDeSantis launches transition\n\nDeSantis, however, will become the next governor of Florida. He released his first statement under the banner of \"Governor-Elect\" and his staffers are using official transition email handles. DeSantis has been under the radar during the recount process. He was spotted in Tallahassee this week and already has staff on the ground preparing for the transition. Gillum hasn't conceded. The two have not spoken since election night, but DeSantis did offer an olive branch to his former opponent, writing \"I invite Mayor Gillum to join me in the days ahead in a conversation about the future of our great state.\"\n\nNelson's last gasp: Undervotes\n\nFriday begins the last phase of this process. Counties will begin counting, by hand, the overvotes and the undervotes in the race for senate and agriculture commissioner. What are they? An undervote is a ballot where the machine interprets no vote being cast in a race. An overvote is when the machine interprets more than one vote cast in a single race. Human eyes will attempt to decipher the intent of voters that did not fill out their ballots correctly, and in certain Democratic heavy counties (Broward), those ballots are in pretty big numbers and could open an opportunity. While there is a chance that the results are different, that chance remains slim. In most cases, under and overvote counts follow the same trend as existing results. In this case that means a Scott win for the Senate seat."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "How Arnold Palmer made Fred Couples 'feel special'", "description": "Fred Couples is as synonymous with Augusta National as blooming azaleas, towering pines and green jackets, but one of the silkiest swingers in town is being out-gunned.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/16/sport/fred-couples-living-golf-masters-augusta-caddie-on-the-bag-spt-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181023114722-fred-couples-tease-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:43:12Z", "content": "(CNN) Fred Couples is as synonymous with Augusta National as blooming azaleas, towering pines and green jackets, but one of the silkiest swingers in town is being out-gunned.

The obituary she wrote for Maddie, published in Seven Days last month, became a virally shared article. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) Time is behaving strangely these days. I'm told that is one of the side effects of grief -- days muddled by sadness and pierced by moments so unbearable they bring me literally to my knees, general confusion over what time it is, when to eat or sleep. But I'm always aware of how long it has been since my sister, Madelyn Ellen Linsenmeir, died. As I write this, I've lived 39 days in a world that doesn't include the beautiful girl who wanted to star in Broadway musicals and had a voice that made you believe it was possible. I know it's been nearly a month since the obituary I wrote for her was read and shared by people around the world. It was 14 years ago that my sister took a pill at a party and loved the way it made her feel, and 12 years since she started injecting heroin to satisfy the addiction that blossomed from that one pill.\n\nThat pill was OxyContin, the brand name of a sustained-release formulation of the opiate-based painkiller oxycodone. While my sister tried it recreationally as a teenager, more than 14 million prescriptions for OxyContin were written in 2001 and 2002 alone, often by doctors who had been falsely led to believe it was less addictive than other painkillers.\n\nBy the time my sister tried OxyContin in 2004, it was one of the most commonly abused prescription opioids in the US. Purdue Frederick Company, an affiliate of Purdue Pharma, the drug manufacturer that first produced OxyContin, eventually pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misleadingly advertising the drug but was still allowed to sell it.\n\nBy 2017, the overall opioid prescribing rate in the US was more than 58 prescriptions per 100 people, with enough opioid prescriptions in 16% of US counties for every single person to have one.\n\nIf those pills were seeds, the fruit they bore was a bounty crop: more than 2 million people are addicted to opioids, and countless more are directly or indirectly affected by the disease. I may not be able to keep track of the days or hours right now, but I know it is time to hold accountable the politicians who have stood by and allowed this crisis to take place.\n\nWe call it the Opioid Epidemic, but that useless phrase doesn't describe what is happening to actual human beings in communities across our country. It should be called the My Beautiful Little Sister Lost Custody of Her Son, Stole From and Conned People, Was Raped and Burned With Cigarettes, Tried to Commit Suicide, Had Sex for Drugs and Money, Went to Jail, Was Homeless, and Ultimately Lost Everything Including Her Own Life Epidemic. Or the Thousands and Thousands of People Are Dying While Drug Companies Make Billions and Spend Billions on Lobbyists to Protect Their Interests Epidemic. Or the System Is Failing People Who Are Dying a Slow, Extremely Miserable Death in Spite of the Fact That There Are Actual, Science-Based Solutions Epidemic.\n\nBecause there are, in fact, solutions. From evidence-based treatment to harm reduction, there are solutions that might have saved not only my sister but the 70,000 people the CDC estimates died from drug overdoses in 2017 alone.\n\nA year ago, President Donald Trump's administration declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Last month he signed a law that he claimed would \"end the scourge of drug addiction.\" But it won't. It won't even come close. While the bipartisan bill, conveniently signed just two weeks before the midterm elections, includes some meaningful measures, experts agree it doesn't go nearly far enough since it omits essential life-saving solutions and fails to adequately fund its own proposals.\n\nFor example, my sister was arrested and incarcerated multiple times, (always for nonviolent crimes directly related to her disease) and died in disturbing circumstances while she was in custody. A system that responds to a public health crisis with arrests, courts and jails is a system that has failed. But at this point our prisons are full of people addicted to drugs: approximately half of inmates meet the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic criteria for substance use or dependence disorder, according to one study . Why not provide them with life-saving treatment while they're inside?\n\nResearch shows that medication-assisted treatment, a combination of therapy and medication such as buprenorphine or methadone, is the most effective intervention for opioid addiction, and that these medications reduce mortality by half or more . Yet Maddie, like most prisoners, never received treatment while incarcerated -- fewer than 1% of jails and prisons in the US administer FDA-approved addiction medications like methadone or buprenorphine. While Trump's opioid package takes steps to improve access to treatment for people who are incarcerated, it does not appropriate any actual funding to do so.\n\nEven out of jail Madelyn found it difficult to get help. She was often forced to wait days or weeks to get into treatment, inevitably at a short-term facility that required hours of travel for her to attend and our family to visit. Even if she was lucky enough to go to a facility that provided buprenorphine, ( nearly 59% of treatment facilities in the US offer no form of medication-assisted treatment) she found it difficult to access the medication she'd been prescribed in rehab once she re-entered the world.\n\nWhile certified physicians can prescribe opiate-based painkillers, only those with a special waiver can prescribe buprenorphine. When she couldn't get buprenorphine, she was either forced to go without life-saving treatment or make a long trek every day to a clinic that administered methadone. Imagine having to go to the doctor's office every single day to get your insulin or your blood pressure medication; imagine having to do so without a car or money to pay for a bus, let alone an Uber. While the new legislation, dubbed the Support for Patients and Communities Act, ostensibly removes some barriers to buprenorphine prescribing , it lacks the tens of billions of dollars , that are realistically needed to boost access to this life-saving medication and does nothing to reform America's failed treatment system.\n\nJUST WATCHED TV anchor reports on daughter's fatal overdose Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH TV anchor reports on daughter's fatal overdose 01:32\n\nThe law President Trump signed also does virtually nothing to promote harm reduction, which can keep people who use drugs alive long enough to enter recovery. The package failed to expand needle-exchange services or include safe injection spaces. My sister contracted hepatitis C as a result of using dirty needles , and she never had access to a safe injection space, which allows people who use drugs to inject in a medically supervised environment. While safe injection spaces are arguably illegal in the US, cities like Philadelphia and Seattle are considering opening them. There are already more than 100 safe injection spaces around the world, mostly in Europe, Australia and Canada, and studies show they can prevent death and infections like HIV or hepatitis, and increase the number of people entering treatment.\n\nUntil the moment my sister drew her last breath my family held onto the hope that she would not just survive her disease, she would thrive. She had talked about going to college, maybe becoming a nurse so she could help people like herself, meeting someone who loved her and treated her well, and raising her son. We grieve now not just for who she was but who we hoped she would become had she gotten the help she needed.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMy family now holds the hope we once had for Maddie for everyone still suffering from this disease and for their families. But that hope won't be realized without the meaningful action of politicians and policymakers. They are the people who can make sure no one who is addicted to opiates has to hope they can get clean, that their families don't have to hope their loved ones will survive. To save the lives of people like my sister, President Trump, Congress, and state lawmakers must respond to the escalating opioid epidemic with comprehensive, well-funded legislation. It's time to move beyond hope to actually taking the steps needed to end the scourge of drug addiction."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Matthew Robinson, CNN", "title": "'Phallic' owl statue sparks outrage in Serbia", "description": "When the Serbian city of Kikinda unveiled its latest landmark, the reaction was mixed, to say the least.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/16/europe/phallic-owl-statue-kikinda-serbia-scli-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181116093839-01-serbia-kikinda-owl-monument-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:22:25Z", "content": "(CNN) When the Serbian city of Kikinda unveiled its latest landmark, the reaction was mixed, to say the least.

Their decisive victories stand in contrast to a midterm election cycle in which Democrats flipped seven governorships, seven state legislative chambers, and more than 300 state legislative seats.\n\nSo, how did they do it?\n\nLarge majorities of voters in both states like their governors personally, and approve of their job performance, according to state polls as well as national polls comparing them to other governors. Large Democratic majorities in their respective legislatures make bipartisanship a necessary part of the job, and they both have taken advantage of opportunities to adopt policy from across the aisle.\n\nSparkling poll numbers boosted fundraising and galvanized support. Baker and Hogan built massive campaign coffers and were heavily supported by the Republican Governors Association.\n\nApart from their first few months in office, when many voters were still unable to rate them, neither have registered job approval ratings below the 60s in Morning Consult state-by-state polling.\n\nThese enviable ratings are due in part to support from groups typically elusive to Republicans. Democrats, women, people of color, and college educated voters have all given them consistently good marks, according to polls our organizations have each conducted in our respective states. Put simply, they built and maintained the support of voters beyond Republicans.\n\nAnd they needed to. Self-identified Republicans comprised only 30% of midterm voters in both states, according to VoteCast data, an exit poll replacement from the AP, NORC and Fox News. When the dust settled, support for Baker and Hogan among Republican voters was as close to unanimous as you can get in electoral politics. Speculation Republicans would stay home rather than vote for a \"RINO\" (Republican in name only) turned out to be just that.\n\nBut where both men won was with their second base: Moderate Democrats and independents. According to VoteCast , Hogan won nearly a third and Baker won 47% of all Democratic voters in their respective states. Both won handily among independent voters. They also outperformed their challengers among key demographics: women and college-educated voters.\n\nBaker ran nearly even with his Democratic rival in urban areas and among people of color in Massachusetts, a remarkable achievement in this racially charged and geographically polarized political moment. Maryland has considerably more African-American voters than Massachusetts, and Hogan earned support from just under 30% of them, all while running against an African-American opponent.\n\nPresident Trump played a role, too. VoteCast data showed him to be deeply unpopular with voters in both states, and that was a significant factor in determining their vote. Baker and Hogan's Democratic opponents tried in vain to link them to Trump by any possible association, no matter how tenuous. It didn't work.\n\nTheir mix of strategic avoidance -- breaking with the President early and often while keeping open the possibility of working with the administration on certain issues -- effectively neutralized his very real threat to their re-election bids. Hogan and Baker won the majority of voters who said Trump was the reason for their midterm vote -- and those who indicated he wasn't, according to VoteCast data.\n\nTrump may have even helped Baker and Hogan by making them look more moderate by comparison. The relentless Trump-driven Washington news cycle sucked much of the oxygen out of the room, and pre-election polling showed both challengers struggling to get even their names out to voters. The focus on Trump likely didn't help them with fundraising, either, as national donors were more focused on retaking the House or the handful of high-profile Senate and gubernatorial races, rather than long-shot challengers.\n\nDespite their impressive wins at the top of the ballot, neither Baker nor Hogan had any discernible coattails. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ben Cardin cruised to re-election.\n\nIn Maryland , Democrats maintained their veto-proof majority in the General Assembly, picked up seats on county councils and won key races for county executive and all other statewide offices.\n\nIn Massachusetts, all other statewide Republicans and congressional candidates lost, and Democrats added to their supermajorities in both legislative chambers. It seems that the un-Trump brand Baker and Hogan worked hard to cultivate is independently earned, but not transferable.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

Both men are affable and personally likable politicians authentically comfortable bucking their party and working across the aisle. They represented both a check on power and the ability to get things done.\n\nIronically, those qualities are the same that may make both men pariahs in the national GOP, where moderation can hinder political ambitions. But if Republicans -- particularly Republicans frustrated by the direction of politics today -- are getting nervous about another blue wave building in 2020 and want to change course, the approach of these two governors could be a welcomed path to higher ground."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Darran Simon, CNN", "title": "The killings of 8 Ohio family members consumed investigators for 2\u00bd years.

Thousands of miles traveled to 10 states, even as far as Alaska. A search for a silencer.\n\nSince eight members of a family were found dead in the small Ohio rural community of Piketon on April 22, 2016, investigators have chased leads wherever they took them, including Alaska, where the prime suspects had lived. Authorities obsessed over the case, working seven days a week at times, determined to make an arrest.\n\nOn Tuesday, authorities said their hard work resulted in the arrests of members of another family in the killings. Two grandmothers in the suspects' families were also accused of trying to cover up the crime, authorities said.\n\n\"We have obsessively focused on solving this case,\" Pike County Sheriff Charles S. Reader told reporters Tuesday. \"We've been patient when it was painful to be, running down every lead, no matter how small. But it all has brought us to this day.\"\n\nRecently, investigators uncovered key evidence, including a suppressor, also known as a silencer.\n\n\"That was just one of the things that we've been looking for, and we found it. And we continued looking for it till we did find it,\" said Al Lewis, a recently retired major with the Pike County Sheriff's Office who kept working on the case until arrests was made this week.\n\nGeorge \"Billy\" Wagner III, 47; his wife, Angela, 48; and their sons, George Wagner IV, 27; and Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, 26, were indicted Monday by a Pike County grand jury on several offenses, including eight counts each of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications.\n\nThe Wagners had been \"the prime suspects for some time,\" Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said. He declined to say when they were identified as such.\n\nDeWine also declined to identify a motive but said custody of a child \"plays a role in this case.\"\n\nThe Wagners are also accused of forging custody documents, the prosecutor said.\n\nOne of the couple's sons, Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, has also been charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor over contact with one of the victims, Hanna May Rhoden, when she was 15 and he was 20, prosecutors said.\n\nHe is the father of Hanna May Rhoden's older daughter, who was staying with the Wagners on the night of the killings, prosecutors said.\n\nThe Wagners are from South Webster, about a 30-mile drive southeast of Piketon, a town of about 2,000 residents, around 80 miles east of Cincinnati.\n\nAngela Wagner's mother, Rita Newcomb, 65, of South Webster, and George \"Billy\" Wagner's mother, Fredericka Wagner, 76, of Lucasville, Ohio, face felony charges of obstructing justice and perjury over allegedly misleading investigators, according to prosecutors.\n\nFive of the suspects are in custody in Ohio. George \"Billy\" Wagner, the family patriarch, was arrested in Kentucky but waived extradition Wednesday. Law enforcement officers are expected to take Wagner back to Ohio in a few days, according to John Hayne, assistant Fayette County attorney in Kentucky.\n\nCNN couldn't immediately determine whether lawyers had been appointed to represent the defendants.\n\n'Just hard, tough police work'\n\nMany of the victims were killed as they slept, authorities said.\n\nAuthorities released this chart tracing the relationships of the Rhoden family members.\n\nIn addition to Hanna May Rhoden, 19, those slain included her parents Christopher Rhoden Sr., 40; and Dana Rhoden, 37; and two of the divorced couple's other children, Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 20, and Christopher Rhoden Jr., 16. Other victims were Christopher Sr.'s brother Kenneth Rhoden, 44; Hannah Gilley, 20, who was engaged to Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden; and Gary Rhoden, 38, a cousin.\n\n\"What solved this case was just hard tough police work, day after day after day,\" DeWine said.\n\n\"Our investigators, any analysts have lived this case, have lived it. It has been all consuming for them.\"\n\nThe 2016 killing rattled many in the rural community, among them Reader, a Pike County native. The sheriff said that day \"changed a lot of our lives, including mine.\"\n\nReader and Lewis were among law enforcement officers who shared the news of the arrests with family members.\n\nLewis said there were \"a lot of tears, a lot of crying.\"\n\n\"We fulfilled the promise that we made that we're going to make arrests on this case,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "nshalalda", "title": "\u0625\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e\u064a\u0629 \u0642\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629 \u0623\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u062a\u0632\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0648\u062c", "description": "\u0622\u0646\u0627 \u062c\u0627\u0633\u0631.. \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0641\u0632 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0645\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062a\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u062d\u0633\u0628\u060c \u0648\u0625\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629 \u062a\u0647\u0628\u0637 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629 &quot;cab triple 1260&quot;. \u0648\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u062a\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0621\u0644 \u0639\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u062b\u064a\u0631\u064c \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629\u060c \u0641\u0647\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0633\u0631 \u0642\u062f \u0646\u062c\u062d\u062a \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0647\u0627.", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/travel/video/2018/11/16/v68193-anna-gasser-cab-triple-1260-snowboarding-history-austria-olympics-alpine-edge-sp", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/16/images/181115111221-anna-gasser-tease-2.jpg?h=4c03725a&itok=Qd0Xxo-Y", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:05:04Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u0622\u0646\u0627 \u062c\u0627\u0633\u0631.. \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0641\u0632 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0645\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062a\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u062d\u0633\u0628\u060c \u0648\u0625\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629 \u062a\u0647\u0628\u0637 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629 \"cab triple 1260\". \u0648\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u062a\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0621\u0644 \u0639\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u062b\u064a\u0631\u064c \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629\u060c \u0641\u0647\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0633\u0631 \u0642\u062f \u0646\u062c\u062d\u062a \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0647\u0627.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u060c 16 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "AngelaBonachera", "title": "2.550 ciudadanos estadounidenses solicitaron asilo en Canad\u00e1 en 2017.

Su peso se redujo en un 12%, y fueron estabilizados en ese peso y sometidos a una dieta alta, media o baja en carbohidratos por 20 semanas.\n\nLos tipos de dietas estaban hechas as\u00ed: 1) un 20% de carbohidratos y prote\u00edna y en un 60% de grasas; 2) 40% de carbohidratos y grasa y un 20% de prote\u00edna, y 3) 60% de carbohidratos y 20% de prote\u00edna y grasa.\n\n\u201cEncontramos que el tipo de dieta que la gente come tiene un mayor impacto en su metabolismo. Aquellos con la dieta baja en carbohidratos quemaron 250 calor\u00edas al d\u00eda m\u00e1s que aquellos con una dieta alta en carbohidratos, aunque todos los grupos tuvieran el mismo peso\u201d, dijo el doctor David Ludwing, investigador principal del estudio y cordirector del Centro de Prevenci\u00f3n de la Obesidad New Balance Foundation del Hospital de Ni\u00f1os de Boston.\n\nMientras los participantes estaban en estas dietas, su ingesta de calor\u00edas fue controlada para que ellos pudieran mantener el peso de referencia.

The statue is estimated to weigh about 4.2 metric tonnes.\n\n\"We very much look forward to this meeting and having an opportunity to have a discussion directly with the Rapa Nui community,\" the British Museum said in a statement. \"The subject of the talks would involve taking the delegation to see Hoa Hakananai'a and then discussing any future proposals they have.\"\n\nWorld's tallest statue unveiled in India\n\nWhile some want the original statue returned, others have proposed a deal involving a replica moai and a financial donation from the British Museum, which would be used to protect the Rapa Nui cultural heritage, according to Spain's EFE news agency.\n\nConservation is an increasingly important issue for Easter Island, with growing concerns about the impact of tourism.\n\nDespite its isolated location in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a five-hour flight from the Chilean capital of Santiago, the island has become a popular tourist destination.\n\nWith visitor numbers putting pressure on local infrastructure, the government in August introduced a 30-day time limit for visits.\n\nInterest in the island was also piqued when scientists revealed that its history might be more complicated than previously thought.\n\nFor decades, researchers believed that the original population of the island destroyed itself through infighting and depletion of natural resources.\n\nHowever, a study published in August showed that the society was sophisticated and collaborative.\n\n\"Ancient Rapa Nui had chiefs, priests, and guilds of workers who fished, farmed, and made the moai. There was a certain level of sociopolitical organization that was needed to carve almost a thousand statues,\" lead study author Dale Simpson Jr., an archaeologist at the University of Queensland, said in a statement at the time."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "nshalalda", "title": "\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u064a\u0628\u062d\u0631 \u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062c\u062f\u062f\u0629", "description": "\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645 2013\u060c \u0646\u0641\u062f \u0645\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0628\u060c \u0641\u064a\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u0648\u062f \u0623\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u062a\u0648\u0627\u062c\u062f\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u064a\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0644\u0633\u064a. \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062f\u0641\u0639\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0643\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0637\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0628\u062d\u0644 \u0645\u0628\u062a\u0643\u0631 \u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0629.", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/travel/video/2018/11/16/v68192-sailing-world-renewable-energy", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/16/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-16%20at%204.20.10%20PM.jpg?itok=R4aV6mQ7", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T12:26:58Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645 2013\u060c \u0646\u0641\u062f \u0645\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0628\u060c \u0641\u064a\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u0648\u062f \u0623\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u062a\u0648\u0627\u062c\u062f\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u064a\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0644\u0633\u064a. \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062f\u0641\u0639\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0643\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0637\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0628\u062d\u0644 \u0645\u0628\u062a\u0643\u0631 \u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0629.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u060c 16 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "CNN Business Before the Bell - CNN", "description": "CNN CNN Business Before the Bell CNN CNN Business Before the Bell.

Only the cooperation of teammates solving mental puzzles and completing physical challenges can release them from the water's frozen grip.\n\n\"For the first guys in the ice it was brutal,\" says John McBride, head speed coach for the US men's ski team. \"We didn't work together as a team, we weren't communicating effectively.\"\n\nPlunging his team in ice is a technique McBride learned from US special forces and is part of his quest to take American downhillers back to the top.\n\nTo make them ski faster, he trains the brain. And his methods are somewhat extreme.\n\nIn the search for the next Bode Miller, McBride subjected his squad to a Navy Seal training camp, and \"scared\" them on a climbing expedition on one of Colorado's most difficult \"14ers.\"\n\nIt is all in pursuit of one goal. For all of Lindsey Vonn's success , no American man has ever won the season-long downhill crown, despite Miller and Phil Mahre winning World Cup overall titles.\n\nThe last US Olympic downhill champion was Tommy Moe in 1994, and not since Daron Rahlves in 2003 has a US skier won the iconic Kitzbuehel downhill. Of the current squad, only Steve Nyman and Travis Ganong have won races on the World Cup downhill circuit.\n\nMcBride is a man on a mission to change all that.\n\n\"The top tier [of ski racers] are all extremely fit, all talented, all work hard, 95% are extremely passionate about what they do. That final mind piece can be a game changer,\" McBride told CNN Sport by telephone from his home in Aspen.\n\n\"The mental skills package is the deciding piece between being an athlete that's contending to be on the podium versus an athlete who is 10th on any given week.\"\n\n'Band of brothers'\n\nFor the Americans, who spend so much time away from home on the predominantly European circuit, McBride's starting point is to foster an environment \"where guys not only push and pull off each other but support each other and believe in each other.\"\n\n\"The team component in skiing racing is often overlooked because it's an individual sport,\" he says. \"We spend so much time on the road together it's an important piece of the puzzle,\" he says.\n\nTo reinforce the idea, US teammates Marco Sullivan and Steve Nyman forged the concept of the \"American Downhiller\" as a cultural identity to bond the team as they take on the battalions of Austrians, Swiss, Italians, French and Norwegians.\n\n\"I sort of see it as a band of brothers,\" says McBride, who is on his second stint with the US team after four years with the Canadians and a spell coaching Miller when he competed independently for Team America and won his second World Cup overall crown in 2008.\n\n\"They all have an understanding of what it means to be downhillers. It's different to slalom skiers. These guys push each other to the edge of destruction.\n\n\"When you're going 90mph down a hill you know that if you go into the red room (the fence) there's a good chance you're going to be injured.\n\n\"There's a lot of consequence to what these guys do and creating this band of brothers, this 'American Downhiller' concept is something the guys can take pride in and support each other and hopefully encourage others to be a part of.\"\n\nBode Miller won two World Cup overall titles in 2005 and 2008.\n\nPhotos: Skiing into a new season All eyes will be on Lindsey Vonn in her final season as she strives to become the most successful ski racer ever.

You can't cheat.\n\n\"It's scary, and it pushes you in a way that is very mental. You have to reach down and find a different place mentally and that can be hard to do in our normal every day lives. All the guys realized their limits are not necessarily where they think they are and they could do more than they expected.\"\n\nThe tangible benefit for downhillers is to help them achieve a relaxed state of alertness and focus before and during a race \"where your performance and stress meet in a place where you can execute your highest level, which can be very valuable,\" says McBride.\n\nAmerican downhiller Steve Nyman heads towards the 'red room' at Kitzbuehel.\n\n'Stressful'\n\nThe ice exposure was an exercise in team work and reliance on others. While some plunged into the freezing water, others had to figure out puzzles and run hill sprints up sand dunes before they could climb out.\n\n\"The first guys were blue by the time they came out,\" said McBride. \"But everyone learned from the experience and we got better at it.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm sure they weren't psyched, but if I'm pushing guys to a place where they're not happy, but it's potentially productive in the big picture, I'm OK with that.\"\n\nThis summer McBride also took his team to Colorado on an overnight expedition to scale the 14,130ft Capitol Peak, one of the most difficult and technical of the \"14ers.\"\n\n\"What was important was how we support each other, how to stay engaged if you're scared and talk about and figure it out,\" he said.\n\n\"I know it scared some guys. These guys are very comfortable going 90mph on a pair of skis, they know their world and have been doing it for a long time. Even fearless downhillers getting put in an environment that is foreign can be stressful and that's the plan.\"\n\nFor the physical part of the puzzle, training for downhillers is \"extensive\" and combines strength training to resist the G-forces in turns and high-impact landings on jumps -- \"all these guys can squat twice their body weight multiple times\" -- with aerobic and high-intensity anaerobic training to build their ability to be powerful for the duration of a race.\n\nOn the special forces camp in California the skiers performed a mile rescue swim dragging a body followed by sprints up sand dunes or loaded wheelbarrow pushes or pulls wearing a harness \"for two minutes uphill at maximum exertion.\"\n\n\"A good testimony to the fitness levels of alpine ski racers is that over history guys like Bode Miller have won the Superstars contest against greats in NBA and NFL and the Olympics and other sports,\" said McBride.\n\nPhotos: Skiing's speed queen The world's greatest female ski racer Lindsey Vonn has announced the forthcoming ski World Cup season will be her last. Here's a look at her glittering career to date. Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: Skiing's speed queen She made her Olympic debut at Salt Lake City 2002 as a 17-year-old, finishing 32nd in slalom and sixth in the combined slalom/downhill event. Hide Caption 2 of 14 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Lindsey Kildow -- as she was then before marrying fellow skier Thomas Vonn -- won her first World Cup race with victory in the downhill at Lake Louise, Canada, in 2004. Hide Caption 3 of 14 Photos: Skiing's speed queen In 2005, Vonn signed with Red Bull and began working with a completely new coaching team. She seemed set for the start of something special. Hide Caption 4 of 14 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Any momentum from the new deal was slowed during the 2006 Olympics in Italy, though. A fall in practice resulted in a short stay in hospital. She recovered in time to compete but could only manage seventh in the Super G and eighth in the downhill events. Hide Caption 5 of 14 Photos: Skiing's speed queen However, Vonn quickly bounced back and won the first of three straight World Cup titles in 2008 at the age of 23. Hide Caption 6 of 14 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Golden girl Vonn achieved her Olympic dreams in 2010. She won the Olympic downhill gold at Whistler and added bronze in the super-G.

Hide Caption 10 of 14 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Injuries continued to hamper Vonn.

Wind tunnel testing helps with aerodynamic form in the tuck.\n\nMcBride acknowledges that the best skiers also have an X-factor, starting with Miller.\n\n\"Number one, he was an incredible athlete with an incredible sense of timing and mental ability,\" he says.\n\n\"He was very poised under pressure in competition. And he could look at a course quite quickly and recall details that were extremely important to going fast.\n\n\"When he trained, he trained hard. He pushed things all the time -- that was what allowed him to push his envelope when he raced.\n\n\"He knew what was important for him to compete at the highest level and he was able to pull it off. That wouldn't necessarily go over very well with a coach if you weren't able to pull it off, but he was.\"\n\nMcBride concedes that \"phenomenal\" athletes like Miller or Vonn \"don't come along every day and are uber talented,\" but insists the US team \"need to continue to push the envelope of how we can do better, to stay up with the other nations, or be better than other nations, that's our goal.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Aksel Lund Svindal's golden Olympic redemption Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Aksel Lund Svindal's golden Olympic redemption 02:42\n\n'Optimist'\n\nThe US speed team spends a lot of time with the Norwegians, who from a small base have two of the world's standout stars in Aksel Lund Svindal and Kjetil Jansrud.\n\nBut when faced with the might of Austria or Switzerland, nations which have ski racing in their DNA, McBride accepts the USA has something of a hill to climb.\n\n\"In a country like Austria ski racing is the national passion. In America ski racing is not the national passion, there are so many distractions,\" he says.\n\n\"Alpine skiing is a European sport, so there's a different cultural piece there, with different support from the community and national level.\n\n\"The financial piece is always a challenge. In this country it's an extremely expensive sport and it's tough for families to make that their primary goal in life to support their children in ski racing.\n\n\"It doesn't mean we can't do better, it doesn't mean we don't have the athlete base because we do. We need to figure out how to encourage them to be part of what we do and figure out how to nurture them.\"\n\nIt's a work in progress, but having seen Miller and Rahlves go close to World Cup downhill titles, McBride insists he is an \"optimist.\"\n\n\"Have we been able to pull it together to make that happen. No? But I think it's possible,\" he says.\n\n\"We've got guys who can win a title if they're healthy. Steven Nyman and Travis Ganong are in a place where they can be contenders.\"\n\nThe American downhillers are gearing up for winter in the fast lane."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Omar Jimenez, CNN", "title": "Malibu residents stay up all night to save neighborhood from fires", "description": "Robert Spangle didn't shower for five days.

He barely slept. He was on a mission to make sure his Malibu hometown didn't burn to the ground.\n\n\"I would set my alarm to go off every 30 minutes,\" Spangle said. \"I would sleep for 30 minutes, have the alarm go off, scan for 15 minutes and then go back to sleep. That was our routine for five days.\"\n\nDay in and day out, the 29-year-old Marine sat perched on top of Malibu's scenic Point Dume, spotting hotspots and coordinating resources quickly to make sure those flare ups didn't turn into anything worse.\n\n\"As a Marine, I was in the infantry and I was a reconnaissance Marine so some of those skill sets came into play in this. Detailed observation. Relating that information to very specific positions on maps,\" Spangle said.\n\n\"In the reconnaissance community, five or six days a week sleeping on the ground with no electricity, no comfort, no conversation with very little food and water in really harsh conditions is a good day, the medium.\"\n\nThere was something nearly every night that either caught fire or flared up again, even days after the worst of the Woolsey Fire passed through, Spangle said. To him, it was an important reminder.\n\n\"Every night, it was tempting to go down and sleep in a proper bed, but the fear of waking up and being surrounded by flames or you know, someone's house going up which could have been prevented by vigilance kept all of us from that.\"\n\n'Point Dume Bombers' at work\n\nIn all of this, Spangle was merely the coordinator, communicating by walkie-talkie with a group of other Malibu natives.\n\n\"I'd drawn a map of the surrounding area, and when I saw a flare up with my binoculars, I would tell them where approximately it was. They would go put it out,\" he said.\n\nThe \"they\" is a group of hometown guys dubbed \"The Point Dume Bombers,\" named after the notorious surf team that used to represent that community decades ago. All of them had grown up hearing stories about \"The Bombers,\" and now they were the ones keeping the community afloat.\n\n\"The firefighter presence is not big enough here in Malibu to save everybody's home, so you stay and you fight for yours,\" said Sam McGee, one of the Point Dume Bombers. \"When the time came, there was no hesitation. We didn't know whether or not we were going to succeed but we knew ... we were going to try.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old carpenter estimates the crew put out at least 100 hotspots over five days. Out of 144 hours, he said, they slept nine.\n\n\"I'm not saying that we completely saved all of these homes. Some had luck on their side, who knows what would have happened if we weren't here,\" McGee said. \"What I do know is that there weren't any other structure fires aside from the first bad night.\"\n\nEvery day, they grew in numbers and became more organized. At one point, they were working two or three different firefighting efforts at the same time. Then, after five days of physical exhaustion and no sleep, the team felt the job was complete.\n\n\"For the first time in a very long time in my life, feeling that safety was this incredible luxury,\" Spangle said.\n\n'Malibu is not all Miley Cyrus and Caitlyn Jenner'\n\nIt's oftentimes the big celebrity names that people associate with the world famous Malibu, but homeowners there say it is so much more.\n\nMany working-class residents have been in the community for decades, before it became a destination for the rich and famous, and the potential for destruction to their properties could mean they would never be able to return.\n\nIt's part of what motivated McGee and Point Dume Bombers to fight for their own.\n\n\"Malibu is not all Miley Cyrus and Caitlyn Jenner,\" McGee said. \"If we lose this house, that's all we have.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "nshalalda", "title": "\u064a\u0642\u0648\u062f\u0648\u0646

California wildfires\n\nThe numbers just keep shooting up. The death toll from Northern California's Camp Fire is now at 63, after the remains of seven people were found. But the real eye-popping stat is the number of people listed as missing. That s oared to 631 after investigators added information from callers who reported people missing to the dispatch center the day the fire erupted. There do appear to be duplicates on the list, and some people who evacuated may have unreliable cell phone service due to the fire. Meanwhile, some survivors say they never got emergency alerts on their phones that could have warned them of the fire.\n\n2. Cambodia\n\nTwo senior members of one of the most murderous regimes in history had their day of reckoning. Nuon Chea, 92, and Khieu Samphan, 87, were found guilty of genocide by an international tribunal, a landmark verdict that may bring closure to millions of Cambodians. The pair are the senior surviving members of the Khmer Rouge , the tyrannical communist faction that killed more than 1.7 million people -- about a fifth of Cambodia's population -- during the 1970s. Both men were sentenced to life in prison.\n\n3. North Korea\n\nNorth Korea has tested some kind of weapon , and the world is trying to figure out just what it is. The North's state media said it was a \"newly developed ultramodern\" weapon. Whatever it is, it's a sign North Korea is ready to go back to a more antagonistic relationship with the US if nuclear disarmament talks continue to go poorly. The weapon could have been a piece of long-range artillery like \"a multiple rocket launcher,\" a South Korean government source told CNN. Meantime, Vice President Mike Pence said the US has dropped a key demand of the North, which will not have to provide a full list of its nuclear and missile sites before President Trump meets early next year with its leader.\n\nJUST WATCHED North Korea media: Kim inspects new weapon Replay More Videos ...

Florida recount\n\nFlorida's putting the machines away and will start recounting ballots by hand in its hotly contested US Senate race. The manual recount is needed because after the machine recount, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson was within the 0.25% margin required for a hand recount in his race against Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Still, it looks like Nelson's odds of winning look pretty slim. That's because Scott picked up a few dozen more votes during the first recount. Meanwhile, the governor's race looks like it may be done. After a machine recount, that race is still outside the margin required for a hand recount, so it's likely former GOP Rep.

But Chief US District Judge Mark Walker isn't a normal jurist. Walker, a colorful and relaxed judge who was nominated to his post by President Barack Obama in 2012, \u2026 [+6420 chars]", "fulltext": "Walker, a colorful and relaxed judge who was nominated to his post by President Barack Obama in 2012, now finds himself at the center of Florida's election recount, hearing at least eight cases on the matter.\n\nIn a quiet, monotone courthouse not known for abundant color, he stands out.\n\nSporting a bow tie over his black robes during marathon hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, Walker played devil's advocate with both sides of the courtroom, probing each argument with a mix of legalese, current events and humor. He lamented the county's current lack of faith in democracy, assured the courtroom that he was the most tired person there and compared lawyers representing Florida's and Republican interests to the three bears from \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\"\n\n\"They are kind of like the little bear,\" he said of their arguments, with a smile, \"They are looking for it to be just right.\"\n\nA sprinkling of humor\n\nWalker's humor belies his importance in Florida politics, but it has been well received even by the sometimes-humorless lawyers, who often crack smiles at Walker's quips or even laugh.\n\nAnd Walker is willing to keep a joke going. He referenced Tribbles -- the rabbit-like creatures from \"Star Trek\" that were known to reproduce exponentially -- when he looked out into his courtroom on Wednesday and saw nearly two dozen lawyers before him. But what some didn't know was that reference was a call back to a joke he had made a day earlier.\n\n\"I feel a little bit like Captain Kirk in the episode when the Tribbles started to multiply,\" he had said about the number of lawsuits on a conference call earlier in the week.\n\nThe jokes continued Thursday morning, when Walker, speaking to lawyers on yet another conference call, hypothetically said he would rule in favor of the attorneys for Democrats and watch Republican heads explode like he saw in a movie once.\n\n\"I'll not make that movie reference,\" he said quickly, moving along.\n\nMinutes later, at the end of the call, he assured all those listening that he was referencing the \"Kingsman\" movie series. (He ended by saying he was hoping that didn't actually happen to the lawyers.)\n\nJudge Mark Walker is shown in a sketch from the Florida voting recount hearing November 15.\n\nWhen he asked the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, Susan Bucher, for a guess as to when she would be able to finish the manual and hand recount in the Senate race, he did it with a imaginative caveat: \"Godzilla could come out of the ocean at Palm Beach ... barring that, when do you expect to finish?\"\n\nFor some judges, references like this would be uncommon -- even bizarre. But Walker has sprinkled his hearings with an array of colorful comments, much to the enjoyment of political aides who think the legal fight has become a slog.\n\nWhen a lawyer on the Republican side made an argument about standing, Walker said it didn't pass the smell test and that he felt like he was having his face pushed into a \"cow patty.\"\n\nDuring a hearing about how a voter's signature on a ballot may not match the signature they have on file, Walker suggested a hypothetical: What should my grandmother, who has Parkinson's and couldn't make the signature she once did, do if she wanted to vote by mail? After lawyers attempted to answer the question, Walker interjected to inform them that his grandmother was actually dead.\n\nWhen he ruled on that case, Walker opened with a current events reference: the National Football League. \"Consider the game of football,\" he wrote. \"Football fans may quibble about the substance of the rules, but no one quibbles that rules are necessary to play the game.\"\n\nLong days on the job\n\nWalker, in between making jokes, has been working incredibly long hours. After two other federal judges recused themselves in election matters, nearly every legal question on the recount fell to Walker, forcing his staff and him to work until midnight for multiple days.\n\nThat has clearly put everyone -- including Walker -- on edge, and the judge has become testy with lawyers he thinks are wasting time.\n\nWhen a lawyer began asking an obvious question, Walker jumped in: \"Let's ask something other than a common-sense question.\" When the lawyer continued, asking Supervisor of Elections for Leon County Mark Earley a question that had already been asked, Walker hit back hard.\n\n\"I understand you are billing by the hour,\" Walker said curtly. \"I recall the question the first time it was asked.\"\n\nWalker's ties to Florida run deep. Born in the city of Winter Garden, he is what's known as a \"double Gator,\" someone who completed undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Florida. Walker received his BA at the university in 1989 and graduated from the law school in 1992.\n\nWalker began his legal career by clerking with the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals and the Florida Supreme Court before briefly going into private practice. Before he was elevated by Obama in 2012, he served as a judge in the Circuit Court of Florida from 2009 to 2012.\n\nHe has a history with one of the central figures in the recount: Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson's bid for re-election.\n\nWalker took Scott to task earlier this year when the judge invalidated the state of Florida's ban on allowing felons to vote.\n\n\"This Court finds Defendants' reasoning to be nonsensical,\" Walker wrote in his decision, which referenced something not aging like fine wine and the long lines for Space Mountain, a ride at Disney World. Walker also suggested that Scott's plan was arbitrary.\n\nWalker wrote: \"A state cannot re-enfranchise only those felons who are more than six-feet tall, who are blue-eyed, who were born in August, who root for the Florida Gators or who call heads during a coin flip.\"\n\nDuring a hearing on Thursday, Walker said he not only held no ill will toward Scott, but he also didn't know the governor.\n\n\"Gov. Scott and I don't know each other,\" Walker said during a hearing in a case over whether the governor should recuse himself from election matters. He then, however, pivoted to some media statements that have questioned the governor.\n\n\"And I won't impugn his press secretary's comments,\" he paused, \"about me.\"\n\nIt's become clear during the days of recount challenges that Walker enjoys the give and take of a courtroom, and the gentle ribbing that comes along with his position of power.\n\nWhen a lawyer from the canvassing board in Palm Beach County said they had made a decision because they were worried about being sued, Walker jumped in with a joke about his caseload.\n\n\"I can't imagine,\" Walker said with a smile, \"a lawyer is going to sue over an election.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Ryan Nobles, Kevin Conlon and Gregory Krieg, CNN", "title": "Florida Democratic Party faces questions over provisional ballot push", "description": "Florida Democratic Party officials gave volunteers incorrect information to share with voters about the state's deadline for curing endangered provisional ballots, according to an email obtained by CNN.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/politics/florida-democratic-party-ballots-deadline-information/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181111134445-03-florida-recount-1111-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:02:39Z", "content": "(CNN) Florida Democratic Party officials gave volunteers incorrect information to share with voters about the state's deadline for curing endangered provisional ballots, according to an email obtained by CNN.

The list of people who are unaccounted for grew to 1,011 names, but that number may change once authorities follow up with families to confirm if they've heard from missing relatives, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said Friday.\n\nIn addition to the dozens killed, three other deaths were reported in the Woolsey Fire in Southern California, bringing the statewide death toll from the wildfires to 74.\n\nThe Camp Fire -- the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history -- has destroyed about 9,800 homes and scorched 146,000 acres (an increase of 5,000 acres Friday). It is 50% contained\n\nHundreds of deputies, National Guard troops, anthropologists and coroners are sifting through leveled homes and mangled cars for remains.\n\nSearchers work at a property in Paradise, California, where human remains were found Friday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to visit the region Saturday. Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom plan to accompany him.\n\nSmoke from the large wildfire has prompted several universities to cancel or postpone sporting events. That includes the University of California, Berkeley men's basketball game Thursday night, which was called off, and its football game, which was rescheduled for December 1.\n\n'A lot of people don't know ... we're looking for them'\n\nHonea has said investigators combined all the information they have received from callers since the fire erupted. Some names on the list appear more than once, and it's unclear whether others are duplicates, too, Honea said.\n\nOfficials have said it's hard to determine the number of missing. Some who may have evacuated can't be reached because cell phone service is unreliable, while others haven't reached out to relatives, and they may not know someone is looking for them, Honea said.\n\n\"I want you to understand,\" Honea said earlier this week, \"that there are a lot of people displaced, and we're finding that a lot of people don't know that we're looking for them.\"\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Office published the list on its website. If people find their names on it, Honea said, or names of loved ones they know are safe, they're asked to call the sheriff's office.\n\nFor two days, Paradise police Officer Matthew Gates searched through ash and collapsed buildings for the remains of a woman.\n\nWhen the Camp Fire broke out, a man told Gates his mother was likely driving on a jammed roadway that hundreds used to flee the flames. But Gates couldn't find her.\n\nGates finally came across her at an evacuee shelter.\n\n\"She had burns up her arms and I knew it was her,\" the officer told CNN affiliate KRCR . \"I went and gave her a hug because I've been looking for her body.\"\n\nAuthorities are trying to reach those who called 911 to verify they've made contact with their loved ones, said Sgt. Steve Collins of the Butte County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"We're asking people to call us if they do come in contact with their loved one so that we don't spend time looking for somebody that's already found.\"\n\n'I see flashbacks of the fire'\n\nA week after her family narrowly escaped as the Camp Fire closed in on the town of Paradise, Whitney Vaughan said she feels like giving up.\n\nEverything she and her husband, Grady, own is gone, along with a home they were renting, \"a quirky older house with lots of character and lots of room\" for their six kids, she said.\n\nThankfully, her two kids and his children are able to stay with the other parents, but Vaughan said she and her husband are essentially homeless. One night they just began driving from town to town in search of a motel.\n\n\"So now we are homeless, have no money, are trying to find a place,\" Vaughan said. \"And if that isn't bad enough, when I do close my eyes, I see flashbacks of the fire and the people trapped on our streets. The explosions and the screams will never be a sound that I can forget.\"\n\nThe \"quirky older house with lots of character\" that Vaughan's family was renting no longer exists.\n\nVaughan said she's worried about how she's going to explain to her 7-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son that she'll likely have to move away while they find some level of stability.\n\n\"There are just too many people in the same situation,\" she said. \"I don't know what to do anymore. We have nowhere to turn.\n\n\"This fire has changed us in ways I can never explain.\"\n\n3 deaths in Southern California\n\nMeanwhile, the Woolsey Fire in Southern California has claimed three lives and destroyed 548 structures in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, said Cal Fire, the state's forestry and fire protection agency.\n\nMore than 98,000 acres have been burned since the blaze began November 8, while evacuees remain in shelters, and portions of Malibu and nearby areas must be rebuilt, officials said.\n\nMore than 3,300 firefighters are making progress against the massive wildfire, which was 67% contained as of Friday.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California Jacob Saylors, 11, walks through the burned remains of his home in Paradise, California, on Sunday, November 18.

But Saturday, about 3 a.m. ET, will have less moonlight obstructing the view of the meteors in the United States.\n\nThe diminutive Comet Tempel-Tuttle will cross Earth's orbit, creating a vaporizing shower of debris in the atmosphere. The comet takes 33 years to complete one orbit of the sun.\n\nTypically, there are between 10 and 15 meteors per hour. Be sure to check online to see when it will be visible in your part of the world.\n\nThe meteor shower gets its name from the constellation Leo, the Lion, as the meteors will be coming from the stars that make up the lion's mane. But you don't need to look in the direction of the constellation, because the meteors will appear all across the sky.\n\nThe bright meteors can also be colorful, and they're fast, moving at 44 miles per second -- among the fastest meteors. Fireballs and \"earthgrazer\" meteors are also a hallmark of the Leonid shower. Fireballs are brighter and larger and can last longer than the average meteor, while earthgrazers appear close to the horizon with long, colorful tails.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Madeline Holcombe, CNN", "title": "How a $367,000 GoFundMe scam started with $20 and a good story -- but slowly unraveled", "description": "The tale of a homeless man who gave the last of his money to a young woman stranded on the interstate could leave thousands of donors jaded.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/us/gofundme-scam-donor-trnd/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171124082048-homeless-veteran-johnny-bobbitt-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:44:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Janine McClenny was touched when the story of a homeless man who gave the last of his money to a young woman stranded on the interstate came across her newsfeed.\n\n\"It tugged at my heartstrings,\" McClenny told CNN.\n\nFortunately for everyone moved by the story, the woman and her boyfriend -- Kate McClure and Mark D'Amico -- started a GoFundMe campaign to repay Johnny Bobbitt Jr. many times over.\n\nHe gave $20 to the stranded woman.\n\nMcClenny gave $20 to him.\n\nBut McClenny and others were the victims of a heartwarming tale predicated on a lie, according to Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina.\n\nShe's one of 14,000 donors GoFundMe now has to refund after the couple and Bobbitt were charged with second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception, according to Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina.\n\n\"The story now in hindsight sounds a little unbelievable,\" McClenny said. \"I think I should have thought harder before I decided to give people some of my money.\"\n\nHow did it all fall apart?\n\nAll it took was a picture and a good story.\n\nMcClure and D'Amico were unable to pay their bills and had mounting debt, their texts show.\n\nThen, they met a veteran, Bobbitt Jr., on an off-ramp, Coffina said.\n\nThey went back a month later to get a picture with Bobbitt, who already had what Coffina called a story \"remarkably similar\" to the one the three would peddle on his Facebook page.\n\n\"Okay so wait the gas part is completely made up, but the guy isn't. I had to make something up to make people feel bad,\" McClure told a friend in one of the more than 67,000 text messages investigators reviewed.\n\nAnd, it seems, people did feel bad. The campaign brought in more than $400,000 in donations. After fees, the proceeds of the campaign netted about $367,000, all deposited into McClure's accounts, Coffina said.\n\nAnd they might have gotten away with it, too, Coffina said, had they not gone to court.\n\nBobbitt sued the couple in August , claiming he did not get his fair share and that the money he was promised had disappeared.\n\nThat lawsuit invited a search warrant, a deposition and an investigation into their campaign, which uncovered the conspiracy and the three were taken into custody.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThis kind of misuse is extremely rare, GoFundMe said in a statement. But, the company says they are \"fully cooperating\" with law enforcement and has confirmed that donors will receive a refund.\n\nMcClenny said she now feels foolish for donating, but that the revelation hasn't totally dissuaded her from giving to charity.\n\n\"If I come across something that I think it's worthy then I might donate,\" she said. \"It may change the way I donate in the future... but I think that GoFundMe is still very important to help people.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "olivertapia", "title": "Juez aplaza su decisi\u00f3n sobre la demanda de CNN por el pase de prensa de Jim Acosta", "description": "Si Kelly acepta la solicitud de CNN el viernes, el jefe de corresponsales de la cadena en la Casa Blanca Jim Acosta recuperar\u00e1 su pase de prensa durante un corto periodo de tiempo.

Less so.\n\nThe French champagne house takes its name (which translates as \"Widow Clicquot\") from an extraordinary, pioneering lady who overcame unimaginable hurdles to transform Veuve Clicquot into one of the world's most sought-after fine wines.\n\n2018 marks 200 years since Madame Barbe-Nicole Clicquot invented a revolutionary technique for producing ros\u00e9 champagne -- blending red grapes and white grapes together. Up until then white wine had been colored with berries to give it its unique pink hues.\n\nThis alone would prove be an impressive legacy, but it almost pales into comparison with her other achievements, most of which were marked by a desire to go against every norm, and certainly against what early 19th century French society expected of women.\n\nIn October 1805, Madame Clicquot's husband died of fever at the age of 30. She was just 27 years old at the time, mother to a six-year-old daughter.\n\nChampagne innovator\n\nMadame Clicquot came up with a revolutionary technique for producing ros\u00e9 champagne. Veuve Clicquot\n\nAs a wealthy, aristocratic French widow, she would have been expected to devote her life to raising her child. The idea of a woman of her status working would have been completely unthinkable, so her decision to take over her husband's business was a stunning move.\n\nThis was a period when women were legally considered as minors. They were under the responsibility of their father until they were married, when they then became the responsibility of their husband.\n\nWomen weren't even allowed to hold bank accounts, let alone make personal decisions about money.\n\nHer father-in-law, Veuve Clicquot founder Philippe Clicquot was devastated at his son's passing and set about selling the company.\n\nMadame Clicquot therefore had to prove that not only that she could take on the business, but that he should invest to help her do so.\n\nThe timing could not have been worse as her husband's death came days before the Battle of Trafalgar, a decisive naval battle that led to both France and Britain putting embargoes and blockades on trade.\n\nUnfortunately for Madame Clicquot, the majority of champagne clients were international. With ports closed, trade routes were devastated and her markets disappeared.\n\nIt was only after the end of Napoleon and the French Empire that she was truly able to move the business forward.\n\nShe did so with a brilliant commercial and marketing move, namely by ensuring that hers was the first champagne to enter the lucrative Russian market once the blockade had lifted.\n\nAmid great secrecy, she prepared a massive shipment to St. Petersburg and ensured that it was in place at the border for delivery.\n\nIt reached Russian aristocrats and the royal family, proving such a tremendous success that in time the Russian name for Clicquot became a general term for champagne.\n\nAlexander I of Russia declared that the 1811 vintage was the \"only thing he would drink,\" while folklore even had it that \"sabering\" -- opening a bottle of champagne by removing the neck with a sword -- started with Russian army officers.\n\nRelated content World's 50 most delicious drinks\n\n\"La Grande Dame\"\n\nThe ground-breaking business woman would refuse orders if she felt the champagne wasn't up to standard. Veuve Clicquot / Leif Carlsson\n\nThe marketing masterstroke and subsequent growth bought such acclaim that Madame Cliquot was \"La Grande Dame of Champagne\" while her personal motto -- and that of the company -- became \"only one quality: the finest.\"\n\nFrom bottles to corks and, of course, grapes, she insisted that everything was of the highest quality.\n\nThat also meant that prices were never, ever cut. Even during times of crisis and great commercial challenges, Madame Clicquot always refused.\n\nShe developed such strong, confident connections with her customers that, even if they sometimes ordered 100 bottles and only received 50, they were happy to wait a year to get the other 50.\n\nMadame Clicquot would turn down orders if the champagne didn't meet her standards, because she understood that if you cheated or deceived customers in any way, you'd lose them.\n\nIn 1818, she broke with tradition and convention by reimagining ros\u00e9 champagne through blending white grapes with red wine grapes from parcels of land in the brilliantly named area of Bouzy in the Champagne region, to create a more complex and characterful champagne.\n\nShe was also ahead of her time when it came to public relations and product placement, preferring that advertisements come from somebody separate from the company.\n\nMadame Clicquot would refuse to buy an ad in a newspaper, instead asking for a reporter to write an article explaining that during an official dinner of a King or Lord, Veuve Clicquot champagne was served.\n\nLasting legacy\n\nVeuve Clicquot remains one of the most prestigious champagne houses in the world. Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images for Hublot\n\nHer outlook was also global in scope. Incredibly, Veuve Clicquot had been shipping internationally since the late 18th century, to customers in the United States, South America and beyond.\n\nShe expanded these markets and organized the first shipments to China and even Australia in 1847. In doing so, she found agents to meet customers, organize tastings and expand the business.\n\nMadame Clicquot also planned her succession a full quarter of a century before she eventually died.\n\nShe had originally hired her heir apparent as an apprentice when he was just 20, deciding that he was the right person for the job because he had good business sense and was also adept at wine tasting.\n\nMadame Clicquot ensured he learned everything about wine production and within 10 years he became her associate. She appointed him her official successor another 10 years later.\n\nWhen she died at the age of 89 in 1866, the transition was seamless.\n\nDespite the passing of a woman who defined a luxury product like few others since, the business simply carried on as it had always had done.\n\nThe Veuve Clicquot brand went from strength to strength and became the bubbles of choice for a remarkable array of people, real and fictional.\n\nBritain's Queen Victoria, iconic secret agent James Bond, Rick Blaine (played by Humphrey Bogart) from the movie \"Casablanca\" and the inhabitants of \"Downton Abbey\" in the popular British TV series all included it amongst their tipples of choice.\n\nUltimately, the most remarkable part of her legacy was the fact that her entrepreneurial spirit was centuries ahead of its time, with a vision that could come straight from the pages of a 2018 business book -- except that she wrote it in the 1860's in a letter to one of great-grandchildren."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Allyssia Alleyne", "title": "Sotheby's to spotlight overlooked female Old Masters in landmark auction", "description": "Sotheby's \"The Female Triumphant\" sale will be the house's first auction dedicated to female artists from the 16th to 19th centuries.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/style/article/female-old-masters-auction-sothebys/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115163043-angelika-kauffmann-top-crop-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:18:33Z", "content": "arts Published 16th November 2018 While works of art by Old Masters like Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo and Titian continue to headline auctions and exhibition around the world, their female counter parts are still largely unknown outside art historical circ\u2026 [+4874 chars]", "fulltext": "Allyssia Alleyne , CNN Written by\n\nWhile works of art by Old Masters like Leonardo Da Vinci , Michelangelo and Titian continue to headline auctions and exhibition around the world, their female counter parts are still largely unknown outside art historical circles.\n\nBut next year, Sotheby's will try to raise the profile of a select few -- if only within the world or high-net-worth collectors and art institutions -- with the first auction dedicated to female artists from the 16th to 19th centuries, the auction house revealed to CNN.\n\n\"The Female Triumphant Sale,\" scheduled to run at the end of January during the auction house's Masters Week in New York, will include paintings from Milanese baroque painter Fede Galizia, Neoclassical painter Angelika Kauffmann and French portraitist Elisabeth Louise Vig\u00e9e Le Brun among others. The works will be exhibited and marketed together but sold separately as part of three larger sales.\n\nWith this effort, which is still in the planning stage, Sotheby's will draw attention to the centuries-old gender disparity that has manifested in both art institutions and the marketplace -- including in Sotheby's own showrooms.\n\nThe proof is in the numbers: This year, the house has sold only 14 works by female Old Masters last year, compared to 1,100 by men. But Calvine Harvey, a specialist in Sotheby's Old Master paintings department, says this gap could shrink if female artists achieve more notoriety.\n\nMoment Da Vinci painting sold for $450 million\n\n\"Over the last few years, we've started to see works by female artists really garner extra excitement and enthusiasm, and we've seen some records being broken and major institutions buying at the higher level,\" she said in a phone interview. \"I think it's been pretty obvious in the larger world that this is a moment to be looking at women and women's equality.\"\n\nIndeed, the so-called female Old Masters have been enjoying a renaissance of their own, with the world's most respected museums belated paying homage to artists few have heard of outside of an art historical context.\n\nTwo years ago, Madrid's Museo del Prado reaped both praise and surprise when it hosted its first solo exhibition dedicated to a female artist, Flemish Baroque still-life painter Clara Peeters; and in 2019, the museum will dedicate a show to Sofonisba Anguissola, a court painter for King Phillip II of Spain, and Lavinia Fontana, who is considered the first professional female artist.\n\nLe Brun, Belgian painter Michaelina Wautier and 17th-century painter Artemisia Gentileschi, the best-known female painter of the period, have also been the subjects of major exhibitions in recent years.\n\n\"A glass compote with peaches, jasmine flowers, quinces, and a grasshopper\" (c.1610) by Fede Galizia will be included in \"The Triumphant\" with an upper estimate of $3 million. Credit: Courtesy Sotheby's\n\nAnd yet these belated accolades often serve to further highlight the historic inequalities they're meant to address. In July, London's National Gallery made headlines when it announced it had purchased Gentileschi's \"Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria\" for \u00a33.6 million ($4.6 million), but many were stunned to discover the painting was one of only 21 by a woman in the museum's collection of more than 2,300 European paintings.\n\nHarvey said this institutional erasure of female Old Masters is largely the product of specific forms of gender discrimination that made it all but impossible for women to train and make names for themselves as artists. France's prestigious Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture and London's Royal Academy of Art, for example, had long barred women from taking the life-drawing classes where men homed their skills; and in the Netherlands, women were often excluded from professional artists' guilds.\n\n\"There were all these barriers that were set up for them that really made it difficult. So, a lot of the women artists who did succeed tended to have a father who was in the art world of a relative or someone like that so that they were able to train in their homes from a young age,\" Harvey explained. \"The women were prevented from getting major commissions, from big religious compositions or altarpieces or things like that. Those would all (go to) their male counterparts.\"\n\n\"Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria\" (c.1616) by Artemisia Gentileschi was the 21st painting by a European woman acquired by London's National Gallery. There are more than 2,300 paintings by European men in the gallery's collection. Credit: Heritage Images/Hulton Fine Art Collection/Getty Images\n\nThis explains why, today, even an institution like Sotheby's can struggle to name, let alone gather, enough works by female artists from the period to fill an auction. Harvey says the final catalog is still being finalized, but she anticipates they'll end up including between 15 and 20 works.\n\n\"In the Old Masters market, ultimately, works by a female artist are a real rarity. There are some artists where that drives up their prices, but there are some where it doesn't necessarily because (the artists) don't have that household recognition, and if people are buying for big names -- some people do, some people don't -- it's not a big name,\" Harvey said. But she's hopeful that this can change.\n\n\"This sale is something that, for us, is a way to try to get those names out there in the marketplace: Find these women who we haven't seen at auction before or have gone under the radar and bring them to light.\"\n\nTop image: Detail of \"Portrait Of Lady Georgiana Spencer, Henrietta Spencer And George Viscount Althorp\" (c.1770) by Angelika Kauffmann"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "olivertapia", "title": "Joven de 19 a\u00f1os muere despu\u00e9s de inhalar desodorante en aerosol para drogarse", "description": "Un joven de 19 a\u00f1os falleci\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de inhalar desodorante en aerosol con la intenci\u00f3n de drogarse, de acuerdo con un nuevo reporte, y los m\u00e9dicos que lo atendieron en Holanda est\u00e1n utilizando el caso para subrayar las consecuencias letales de inhalar produc\u2026", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/16/joven-de-19-anos-muere-despues-de-inhalar-desodorante-en-aerosol-para-drogarse/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/cnn-aerosol.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:11:42Z", "content": "(CNN) - Un joven de 19 a\u00f1os falleci\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de inhalar desodorante en aerosol con la intenci\u00f3n de drogarse, de acuerdo con un nuevo reporte, y los m\u00e9dicos que lo atendieron en Holanda est\u00e1n utilizando el caso para subrayar las consecuencias letales de inhala\u2026 [+3144 chars]", "fulltext": "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nSeg\u00fan el informe, hasta 125 muertes por abuso de inhalantes se registran cada a\u00f1o en Estados Unidos\n\nEl grupo m\u00e1s afectado va de los 15 a los 19 a\u00f1os, seg\u00fan estudios\n\nEl abuso de solventes no es un fen\u00f3meno nuevo, se\u00f1ala el reporte, y se registra principalmente en \"personas j\u00f3venes y vulnerables\"\n\n(CNN) - Un joven de 19 a\u00f1os falleci\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de inhalar desodorante en aerosol con la intenci\u00f3n de drogarse, de acuerdo con un nuevo reporte, y los m\u00e9dicos que lo atendieron en Holanda est\u00e1n utilizando el caso para subrayar las consecuencias letales de inhalar productos qu\u00edmicos.\n\nEse tipo de casos son \"muy raros\", de acuerdo con el doctor Kelvin Harvey Kramp de la unidad de cuidado intensivo del Hospital Maasstad en Rotterdam.\n\nKramp explic\u00f3 que como las muertes por inhalaci\u00f3n de desodorantes no son tan comunes, las \"consecuencias en realidad no se conocen\", lo que provoca que la gente siga con este comportamiento da\u00f1ino.\n\nEl paciente, que ten\u00eda un historial de s\u00edntomas psic\u00f3ticos, hab\u00eda sido admitido en un centro de rehabilitaci\u00f3n por abuso de cannabis y ketamina y estaba tomando medicamentos antipsic\u00f3ticos.\n\nDurante una reca\u00edda en julio, se coloc\u00f3 una toalla sobre la cabeza e inhal\u00f3 desodorante en aerosol para drogarse, de acuerdo con el reporte publicado el jueves en la revista BMJ.

Fue ingresado en el hospital y se le indujo un coma cuando el equipo no logr\u00f3 revivirlo.\n\n\"El paciente no ten\u00eda suficiente actividad cerebral como para mantener la vida\", dijo Kramp. Nueve d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de ser admitido, los doctores le retiraron la asistencia y el hombre muri\u00f3.\n\nExisten tres teor\u00edas de lo que pudo haber causado el paro cardiaco, dijo Kramp: el inhalante pudo haber hecho m\u00e1s sensible el coraz\u00f3n del paciente, lo que puede provocar que cualquier situaci\u00f3n de estr\u00e9s posterior, como ser atrapado por alguno de los padres, produzca un paro cardiaco. Adem\u00e1s, los inhalantes disminuyen la fuerza de contracci\u00f3n del m\u00fasculo cardiaco.

To the relief of Downing Street, key Brexit-supporting ministers said they would stay on.\n\nCrucially, May won the support of Michael Gove, a leading Brexiteer who was said to have been on the verge of quitting. \"I am looking forward to continuing to work with all colleagues in government and in Parliament to get the best future for Britain,\" he told reporters mid-morning.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove speaks Friday outside the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in London.\n\nAnother Brexit-supporting minister, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, told CNN he would stay in the Cabinet, and urged fellow Conservative Party lawmakers to support May. \"I think that we have to wait until we conclude this process,\" he said. \"I think the Prime Minister deserves the right to put that case to the European Union.

On November 26, NASA's Mars InSight lander will touch down on the Red Planet at 3 p.m. EST.\n\nInSight, or Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is going to explore a part of Mars that we know the least about: its deep interior. It launched May 5.\n\n\"When InSight drills down into the Martian soil, we'll learn more about how Mars and Earth formed. We'll know more about where we all came from, and why these two rocky worlds are so similar yet so different,\" Bill Nye, CEO of the nonprofit Planetary Society, said in a statement. \"We may learn more about what kinds of planets can harbor life. InSight is more than a Mars mission -- it's a solar system mission.\"\n\nNASA will provide live coverage from mission control, and there are landing watch parties around the world. In 2012, there were similar events to celebrate the Mars Curiosity rover's landing.\n\nWhat is InSight?\n\nMissions like the rovers have provided a great look at the surface, including Mars canyons, volcanoes, soil and rocks, but it's the building blocks below the surface that record the planet's history. InSight will spend two years investigating the interior.\n\nLike on Earth, there are stories locked in the Martian core, mantle and crust. But the history of Mars may be more complete than Earth's because the Red Planet has been less geologically active.\n\nMars was chosen for the mission because of this complete record, which is similar to the formation of Earth, Venus, Mercury and the moon. InSight can also investigate the planet's tectonic activity and meteorite impacts.\n\nAnd this isn't just about Mars. InSight will give us a deeper understanding of how the rocky planets in our inner solar system formed more than 4 billion years ago, like Earth.\n\nIt's similar in design to the Mars Phoenix Mission, which studied ice near the Martian north pole in 2008.\n\nPhotos: The best moments on Mars NASA has been exploring Mars since 1965. Here are some of the best moments captured by Mars missions over the years.\n\n\n\nThis perspective of Mars' Valles Marineris hemisphere from July 9, 2013, is actually a mosaic comprising 102 Viking Orbiter images. At the center is the Valles Marineris canyon system, over 2,000 kilometers long and up to 8 kilometers deep. Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: The best moments on Mars Rovers can take selfies, too.

Hide Caption 2 of 14 Photos: The best moments on Mars Mars is far from a flat, barren landscape. Nili Patera is a region on Mars in which dunes and ripples are moving rapidly. HiRISE, onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, continues to monitor this area every couple of months to see changes over seasonal and annual time scales. Hide Caption 3 of 14 Photos: The best moments on Mars What are blueberries doing on Mars? These small, mineral hematite-rich concretions are near Fram Crater, visited by NASA's Opportunity rover in April 2004. The area shown is 1.2 inches across. The view comes from the microscopic imager on Opportunity's robotic arm, with color information added from the rover's panoramic camera. These minerals suggests that Mars had a watery past. Hide Caption 4 of 14 Photos: The best moments on Mars Mars is known to have planet-encircling dust storms. These 2001 images from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor orbiter show a dramatic change in the planet's appearance when haze raised by dust-storm activity in the south became globally distributed. Hide Caption 5 of 14 Photos: The best moments on Mars Curiosity took images on September 9, 2015, of Mount Sharp, a hematite-rich ridge, a plain full of clay minerals to create a composite and rounded buttes high in sulfate minerals. The changing mineralogy in these layers of Mount Sharp suggests a changing environment in early Mars, though all involve exposure to water billions of years ago.

Hide Caption 7 of 14 Photos: The best moments on Mars This image, combining data from two instruments aboard NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, depicts an orbital view of the north polar region of Mars. The ice-rich polar cap is 621 miles across, and the dark bands in are deep troughs. To the right of center, a large canyon, Chasma Boreale, almost bisects the ice cap. Chasma Boreale is about the length of the United States' famous Grand Canyon and up to 1.2 miles deep. Hide Caption 8 of 14 Photos: The best moments on Mars Although Mars isn't geologically active like Earth, surface features have been heavily shaped by wind. Wind-carved features such as these, called yardangs, are common on the Red Planet. On the sand, the wind forms ripples and small dunes. In Mars' thin atmosphere, light is not scattered much, so the shadows cast by the yardangs are sharp and dark.

Hide Caption 12 of 14 Photos: The best moments on Mars A dramatic, fresh impact crater dominates this image taken by the HiRISE camera on November 19, 2013. The crater spans approximately 100 feet and is surrounded by a large, rayed blast zone. Because the terrain where the crater formed is dusty, the fresh crater appears blue in the enhanced color of the image, due to removal of the reddish dust in that area.

Hide Caption 14 of 14\n\nMarCO is along for the ride\n\nInSight isn't alone on this mission. Two suitcase-size spacecraft, called MarCO, are cube satellites following InSight on its journey. They are the first cube satellites to fly into deep space. MarCO will try to share data about InSight when it enters the Martian atmosphere for the landing.\n\nDuring InSight's entry, descent and landing, the lander will be transmitting information to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that's now circling Mars. But the orbiter can't receive and transmit data at the same time, which would delay the news of the landing by about an hour.\n\nHowever, MarCO can receive and transmit immediately.\n\n\"MarCO-A and B are our first and second interplanetary CubeSats designed to monitor InSight for a short period around landing, if the MarCO pair makes it to Mars,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Sciences Division. \"However, these CubeSat missions are not needed for InSight's mission success. They are a demonstration of potential future capability. The MarCO pair will carry their own communications and navigation experiments as they fly independently to the Red Planet.\"\n\nThe landing: What to know\n\nLanding on Mars is incredibly difficult. Only 40% of missions sent to the Red Planet by any agency have been successful.\n\nPart of this is due to the thin Martian atmosphere, which is only 1% of Earth's, so there's nothing to slow down something trying to land on the surface.\n\nThe United States is the only country to have missions that survived landing on Mars, and NASA has been flying past, orbiting, landing and roving over Mars since 1965.\n\nLike the Phoenix spacecraft, InSight will have a parachute and retro rockets to slow its descent through the atmosphere, and three legs suspended from the lander will try to absorb the shock of touching down on the surface.\n\nBut the engineers prepared the spacecraft to land during a dust storm if need be.\n\nMars is known for its dust storms, some of which can be planet-encircling like one that began in May and has temporarily suspended the Opportunity rover's functions.\n\nTweaks to the original Phoenix design included the heat shield and parachute. The heat shield is thick, capable of being sandblasted by a Martian dust storm, while the suspension lines of the parachute are stronger to cope with air resistance.\n\nInSight won't have a blind landing. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will send weather updates to the mission team in the days before, allowing the team to change when the parachute deploys.\n\nInSight's new home\n\nInSight will be landing at Elysium Planitia, called \"the biggest parking lot on Mars\" by astronomers. Because it won't be roving over the surface, the landing site was an important determination. This spot is open, flat safe and boring, which is what the scientists want for a stationary two-year mission.\n\n\"If Elysium Planitia were a salad, it would consist of romaine lettuce and kale -- no dressing,\" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"If it were an ice cream, it would be vanilla.\"\n\nAfter landing, InSight will unfurl its solar panels and robotic arm and study the entire planet from its parking spot. It's along the Martian equator, bright and warm enough to power the lander's solar array year-round.\n\nThe suite of geophysical instruments on InSight sounds like a doctor's bag, giving Mars its first \"checkup\" since it formed. Together, those instruments will take measurements of Mars' vital signs, like its pulse, temperature and reflexes -- which translates to internal activity like seismology and the planet's wobble as the sun and its moons tug on Mars.\n\nThese instruments include the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structures to investigate what causes the seismic waves on Mars, the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package to burrow beneath the surface and determine heat flowing out of the planet, and the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment to use radios to study the planet's core.\n\nInSight will be able to measure quakes that happen anywhere on the planet. And it's capable of hammering a probe into the surface.\n\n\"Picking a good landing site on Mars is a lot like picking a good home: It's all about location, location, location,\" said Tom Hoffman, InSight project manager at JPL. \"And for the first time ever, the evaluation for a Mars landing site had to consider what lay below the surface of Mars. We needed not just a safe place to land, but also a workspace that's penetrable by our 16-foot-long heat-flow probe.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Nicole Chavez and Joe Sutton, CNN", "title": "Snowstorm slams eastern US, killing 8 and knocking out power", "description": "A strong winter storm moving over the eastern half of the country has claimed at least eight lives and knocked out power for tens of thousands of people.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/us/snow-storm-northeast-southeast-wxc/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115173221-snow-falls-november-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T09:25:20Z", "content": "(CNN) A strong winter storm moving over the eastern half of the country has claimed at least eight lives and knocked out power for tens of thousands of people.

fever crisis, which has spread to 18 provinces and led to the culling of more than 200,000 pigs.\n\nDays after acknowledging the situation was \"serious,\" the Chinese Agricultural Ministry on Friday reported the first outbreak of the disease in the southwestern province of Sichuan in a farm of 40 pigs.\n\nThe news is especially concerning for officials as Sichuan is the top swine-producing region in China -- a country that produces half of the world's pigs with a current population of around 500 million swine.\n\nAlthough the disease poses no direct danger to human health, its arrival and spread in China have increasingly threatened the pork industry, with major potential impact on supplies and prices in coming months.\n\nIn a rare document jointly issued Wednesday by the Ministries of Agriculture, Transportation and Public Security, the government blamed unhygienic vehicles transporting pigs and profit-driven \"lawless elements\" moving animals out of high-risk areas for the disease's rapid spread since the first case emerged in August.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "nshalalda", "title": "\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627

US tariffs have made more than $250 billion of exports from China more expensive, prompting some companies to move production out of the country.\n\nIn a recent survey by two American chambers of commerce in China, one third of the companies who responded said they were looking to switch to production outside of China as a result of the trade war.

The CPK's movement was not designed to kill people or destroy the country. My hope and wishes were betrayed by those who destroyed the movement.\"\n\nLike many other Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan studied in Paris, publishing his doctoral dissertation on \"Cambodia's economy and industrial development.\" On his return home, he became a professor and then took on a senior government position before joining the Khmer Rouge rebels.\n\nIn 1976, he became the head of state of Democratic Kampuchea, and in 1987, years after the fall of Democratic Kampuchea, he replaced Pol Pot as the head of the Khmer Rouge after the former's retirement.\n\nThroughout the previous 2014 trial, he expressed remorse for the suffering of victims, at one point offering Buddhist prayers for the souls of those who had died. But he repeatedly expressed his position that he was merely a figurehead, with no role in Khmer Rouge policy."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN", "title": "Trump takes aim at Mueller as speculation over Russia probe's end grows", "description": "President Donald Trump is acting like he knows something about the Russia investigation that the rest of America has yet to learn.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller-investigation/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170613101920-trump-mueller-split-2-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T06:10:17Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is acting like he knows something about the Russia investigation that the rest of America has yet to learn.\n\nHis Twitter explosion on Thursday targeting special counsel Robert Mueller -- his \"thugs\" and his \"witch hunt\" investigation -- came without an apparent immediate cause.\n\nBut Trump's temper apparently boiled over after meetings on three successive days between the President and his lawyers as they work out written answers for Mueller about alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia in the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"There are some that create more issues for us legally than others,\" Trump's lawyer Rudolph Giuliani told the paper. Some questions were \"unnecessary\" and others were \"possible traps\" or might be irrelevant, he said.\n\nGiuliani's striking complaint about a perjury trap appears to raise the question of why he might be worried about such an issue -- if the President were simply to tell the truth, in answers that will be scrubbed by his legal advisers.\n\nThe questions resulted from a tortuous negotiation between Trump's lawyers and the White House over the President's testimony. They only relate to the collusion part of the investigation and do not concern allegations that the President obstructed justice in the firing of former FBI Chief James Comey.\n\nTrump's huddles with his lawyers coincided with intense activity around the Mueller investigation, which largely went quiet in the days leading up to the midterm elections earlier this month.\n\nThe comings and goings have left Washington on tenterhooks amid mounting speculation that significant action by the special counsel could be imminent.\n\nIn the past, the President's tirades about Mueller have sometimes coincided with developments in the special counsel probe.\n\nThere are expectations that Mueller, who has not unveiled any indictments since July, could be preparing more. CNN has reported that he has also started writing a final report on his investigation.\n\nAll the while, speculation has heated up about the prospect of major staff shakeups in the West Wing, including the departure of high-level officials who previously have worked to constrain Trump's worst impulses.\n\n\"In this administration, there are arsonists and there are firefighters. The President is looking to get rid of the firefighters. The more he does, the faster his administration is going to burn down,\" a senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\nNew questions\n\nThe President's fury sparked questions over whether he has any advance knowledge of any indictments Mueller may be preparing, or has gleaned other insight about the case from his new acting-Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.\n\nMuch of Mueller's work is taking place behind closed doors, but the evident bustle suggests plenty of reasons for Trump's dark mood.\n\nThose events included a visit by Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who is facing jail time on tax and fraud charges, to the special counsel's office on Monday.\n\nAttorneys for Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort, who is cooperating with Mueller after his own conviction, were seen at Mueller's office this week.\n\nJerome Corsi, an associate of former Trump political adviser Roger Stone said on Monday he expects to be indicted for giving false information to Mueller or the grand jury. Corsi later suggested in an interview with Reuters that he's in plea talks with Mueller's team.\n\nStone, who also appears to be in Mueller's sights, released text messages with an alleged WikiLeaks back channel about \"big news\" about Hillary Clinton's campaign six days before the site released hacked emails.\n\nTrump's son, Donald Trump Jr., has reportedly told friends that he could he could be indicted, possibly over a meeting he and other Trump campaign officials held with a Russian lawyer promising \"dirt\" on Clinton.\n\nWith all that in mind, Trump's Thursday morning tweetstorm appears to reveal a President fuming with resentment about the probe and possibly deeply concerned about what it might reveal.\n\nMueller's questions likely offered Trump his most explicit sense yet as to where the investigation may be going and could perhaps offer him some hints about what witnesses have told Mueller. And the task of answering the questions, under the risk of perjury, may be a deeply unpleasant experience for him.\n\n\"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\"They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want,\" the President said, in a comment that could be interpreted as evidence that he has inside knowledge of the investigation.\n\n\"These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\" Trump wrote in one of his most furious attacks on Mueller.\n\nMueller was actually appointed to head the FBI in 2001 by President George W. Bush, and stayed for the rest of his administration and three years into President Barack Obama's term. Obama later extended his 10-year term for another two years.\n\n'A bad week'\n\nSpeaking on CNN's \"The Situation Room\" Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley defended Mueller and his team, adding \"if they are going to do something, I suspect it will be rather soon.\"\n\n\"Obviously, the President had a bad week and he doesn't like these questions, so he is lashing out because he is afraid to take responsibility, frankly for anything,\" Quigley said.\n\nThe President also revealed his anger about the Russia probe in an interview with The Daily Caller on Wednesday, which to some observers seemed like an tacit admission that he had appointed Whitaker after firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions in order to rein in the special counsel.\n\n\"Matthew Whitaker is a very respected man. He's -- and he's, very importantly, he's respected within DOJ,\" Trump told the conservative website.\n\n\"You know, look, as far as I'm concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had,\" he said. \"It's something that should have never been brought. It's an illegal investigation.\"\n\nDemocrats have warned that Whitaker, who is on record with fierce criticisms of the Mueller probe, and now oversees it, is nothing but a political henchman inserted into the top Justice Department job to rein in Mueller.\n\nHis appointment has added fresh urgency to an effort on Capitol Hill to protect Mueller.

Before giving it back to your child, do you wash it in a sink or, perhaps reluctantly, clean it with your own saliva?\n\nDon't feel too guilty if you chose the latter, because a new study suggests that a mother's spit -- and the bacteria in it -- may help prevent allergies in young children.\n\nThe research found lower levels of a troublesome, allergy-causing protein in babies whose mothers reported sucking on their infants' pacifiers, adding to a growing body of evidence that early exposure to microbes may prevent allergies in children.\n\n\"The idea is that the microbes you're exposed to in infancy can affect your immune system's development later on in life,\" said Dr. Eliane Abou-Jaoude, an allergy fellow with the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. She is presenting her findings this weekend at the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting.\n\nMicrobial exposure might prevent allergies\n\nThe new study, which hasn't been peer-reviewed, is \"one more piece of data that early exposure to microbes helps prevent allergies,\" said Dr. Andrew MacGinnitie, clinical director of the Division of Immunology at Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nBut the study has weaknesses as well, MacGinnitie said. It has a small sample size, making it difficult to draw too many conclusions, and factors other than the mother's saliva could have helped develop the children's immune systems.\n\n\"It's possible that sucking on a pacifier is correlated with other, more important factors that predispose or protect against allergens,\" he said, adding that mothers who suck on their children's pacifiers could also \"let their kids play in the dirt, or their whole house could be less clean.\"\n\nUncertainty over causation is why Abou-Jaoude isn't recommending that parents start sucking on their children's pacifiers just yet.\n\n\"What's very, very important to realize is that this was not a cause and effect study,\" she said. \"This is not telling you, if you suck on your child's pacifier, they will not develop allergies.\"\n\nFor those who choose to do so, though, MacGinnitie doesn't see too many risks. \"If the kid were sick, he or she could transmit an infection to the mom or dad, but if the kid is well, this would seem to be unlikely,\" he said.\n\nAnd even if the pacifier falls on the floor, he added, \"in general, the bacteria and viruses on the floor don't cause disease.\"\n\nA decrease in allergy-linked proteins\n\nTo determine allergy risk, researchers looked for a protein linked to allergies. They tracked levels of that protein, the IgE antibody, in 74 infants whose mothers reported using pacifiers. No fathers were included in the research.\n\nJust nine babies had mothers who sucked their children's binkies clean. But compared with the other children, those nine babies had significantly lower levels of IgE antibody, a trend that began when the children were about 10 months old.\n\nThe researchers tracked the babies for only 18 months, making it unclear whether lower IgE levels in infancy would translate to fewer allergies later in life.\n\n\"Based on these levels, you can't really tell what's going to happen to these kids in the future,\" Abou-Jaoude said. \"All is we know is, people with allergies, they usually have higher levels of IgE antibodies. But that doesn't mean that if you have high IgE, you're definitely going to have allergies.\"\n\nOur bodies develop antibodies to fight infections, but MacGinnitie said IgE antibodies are often produced in response to harmless substances -- which is why they're closely associated with allergies.\n\n\"Allergies are an inappropriate response by our immune system to see something that's innocuous as dangerous,\" he said, leading to congestion, hives and other common symptoms.\n\nReducing your child's allergy risk\n\nAbou-Jaoude's team looked at total IgE antibody levels, but researchers can also test for allergen-specific IgE levels, looking at how sensitive a child might be to particular substances, like eggs or dogs.\n\n2013 study in Sweden did just that. Not only did researchers find that infants were less likely to have IgE antibodies against common allergens when their parents sucked their pacifiers, but they were also less likely to develop eczema and asthma by the time they were 18 months old.\n\n\"If I understand the paper and the figure correct, [the new study] found lower IgE levels in children whose parents reported sucking on their pacifier, and that finding supports our results,\" said Dr. Bill Hesselmar, an associate professor in pediatrics at the University of Gothenburg who authored that study.\n\nIn both cases, Hesselmar says, sucking on a baby's pacifier might have transferred \"microbes that could stimulate the immune system so that tolerance develops instead of allergy.\"\n\nStill, there are more practical -- and perhaps more pleasant -- ways to prevent allergies in children. MacGinnitie said that early exposure to some foods, for example, may protect against allergies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nStudies have shown that \"kids introduced to peanuts in the first year of life have a much lower chance of developing a peanut allergy,\" he said, and the American Academy of Pediatrics agrees. In 2017, the group endorsed guidelines recommending that infants at high risk for allergies start eating peanuts as early as 4 to 6 months of age.\n\nChildren who grow up with pets also tend to have a lower allergy risk, MacGinnitie said, but that might be explained by genetics. In other words, allergy-free parents who own pets might just give birth to allergy-free kids.\n\n\"Living on a small farm also probably helps,\" MacGinnitie joked. But he added that, for most parents, \"that's probably not realistic.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Channon Hodge", "title": "Chef Arora: India's first woman with a Michelin star", "description": "Indian Chef Garima Arora's restaurant, Gaa, is in Bangkok, Thailand, and her mix of Indian and Thai flavors has earned her a Michelin star.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/garima-arora-indian-chef-michelin-star/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F181116131343-garima-arora-michelin-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T05:19:12Z", "content": "(CNN) Chef Garima Arora just became the first Indian woman to win a Michelin star.

Unripe jackfruit is popular in India, but the roti is made with the ripe version of the fruit, more popular in Thailand.\n\nGaa is right near the two Michelin-star restaurant, Gaggan, run by another celebrated Indian chef, Gaggan Anand.\n\nArora said there should be no shortage of star chefs coming from India.\n\n\"We are a population of one billion with food culture that is centuries old,\" said Arora in an email to CNN. \"In my opinion, we should be making food trends, not following them. The best chefs and restaurants of the world should be from India.\"\n\nJarek Pajewski/Restaurant Gaa\n\nRelated content Where to eat in Bangkok\n\nArora grew up in Mumbai and drew inspiration early on from her Punjabi family, particularly her father, who loved bringing home exotic foods.\n\nShe started her career as a journalist but was quickly drawn to cooking.\n\n\"I have always had in the back of my mind that someday I would like to have a restaurant of my own,\" said Arora. \"But after 6 months working as a journalist, I began to realize that I probably should get on with it since, to be quite honest, cooking is a young person's game.\"\n\nShe studied at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris before working her way through stints with the UK's Gordon Ramsay and Ren\u00e9 Redzepi of Noma in Copenhagen.\n\nArora moved to Bangkok to work with Anand, but the plan fell through leaving her in Thailand. Anand and three other investors then offered Arora a chance to start her own venture.\n\nGaggan and Gaa are now two of 27 Michelin-starred restaurants in Bangkok and Phuket recognized in the new guide.

He portrayed the migrants as an imminent threat and parroted Fox's use of the word \"invasion\" to describe the travelers. He pushed to keep the migrants in the news.\n\nAnd yet Trump has only used the word \"caravan\" once since election day, and it was almost in passing, at a news conference the next day. The migrants are still heading north, but you'd barely know it from Trump's behavior.\n\nSo here's the thing: Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, predicted this would happen.\n\n\"Right before the election, they try to scare the heck out of you,\" Obama said in a blunt critique of the GOP on October 26. \"And then the election comes, and suddenly the problem is magically gone. Everything's great. 'I'm sorry, what did we say?'\"\n\nThis, Obama said, \"is what happened in 2010, this is what happened in 2012, what happened in 2014, just over and over and over again, they'll just run these same stories and then after the election, suddenly they're not interested anymore.\"\n\nHe brought up three past examples and used each one to criticize Republican messaging techniques.\n\n-- In the run-up to the 2010 midterms, the recent passage of Obamacare fueled rage on the right. \"They said government bureaucrats are going to kill your granny. Remember? 'Death panels.' Then right after the election, what death panels? Didn't exist,\" Obama said.\n\n-- In the run-up to the 2014 midterms, the Ebola outbreak was a big story. At the time, then-businessman Trump argued that Ebola patients should not be allowed to enter the US for treatment. Obama described the faux panic this way: \"Ebola's going to kill everybody. Gotta keep everybody out.\"\n\n-- In 2016, he said, \"it was Hillary's emails. Terrible! That's all you could read about, emails, emails, oh man, threatening our national security, irresponsible. They didn't actually care about it because if they did, they'd be up in arms right now about the fact that the Chinese are listening to our President's unsecured iPhone, which he leaves in his golf cart! What happened? What happened? You know, this was a national security threat. You remember?\"\n\nSo that was Obama's argument: Republicans shamelessly hype certain stories for electoral advantage.\n\nHis comments doubled as a critique of the media, too. And they're interesting to re-read in light of the midterm results.\n\nThe \"caravan\" received daily news coverage when the migrants set out on foot in Honduras in October. Some journalists, in retrospect, thought the amount of attention was excessive, given how far away the migrants were from the US border. Some news outlets produced excellent and nuanced stories about the travelers and their reasons for fleeing Central America. But other outlets, particularly on the pro-Trump side, portrayed the travelers as a threat and sowed conspiracy theories about who was behind the journey.\n\nAs election day neared, many news outlets pulled back on the daily coverage. But Trump talked about the topic practically every day, either on Twitter, in interviews or at rallies. Many of his media boosters on Fox News did the same. So the topic hung in the air.\n\nObama jabbed Fox in his October 26 speech\n\n\"I mean, now there's a certain news station that they just, their business is ramping up these scare tactics, that's what they do,\" he said.\n\nBut other outlets, he argued, are part of the problem too. They amplify \"lies over and over again even when they don't intend to,\" simply by covering what Republicans are talking about, he said.\n\nObama isn't the only Democrat making this case. Media Matters, a liberal media monitoring group, tallied up all of the caravan-related stories in The New York Times and The Washington Post, and found that coverage of the topic \"plummeted\" after the midterms.\n\nMedia Matters called out Fox News, CNN and MSNBC too, saying the cable news channels \"focused their attention on the subject Trump wanted to discuss. And in the same manner as the Post and the Times, the volume of their reporting has dropped substantially since the election.\"\n\nFox's coverage was the most intense -- particularly on its pro-Trump talk shows like \"Hannity\" and \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nCNN's John Avlon reported on \"New Day\" that the \"caravan\" was mentioned on Fox 733 times in the seven days preceding the election, and only 126 times in the seven days since.\n\n\"The president was simply trying to stoke the fires of fear and anger to motivate his base before the election,\" Avlon said.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the migrants are still walking toward the US border. More than 6,000 people their left temporary shelter at a stadium in Mexico City and headed north on Saturday, according to Mexican state-run media.\n\nA small group that broke off from the main group of migrants and traveled north by bus arrived at the border earlier this week. This became big news on Fox's talk shows, some of which ran new banners proclaiming that the migrants moving north constitutes a \"CRISIS.\"\n\nBut it's no longer a lead story in most places. Just as Obama predicted."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "The week in 21 photos", "description": "Take a look at 21 photos from November 9 through November 15.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/world/gallery/week-in-photos-1116/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115165435-16-week-in-photos-1116-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T02:15:54Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Hassan al-Faqeh holds the hand of his 4-month-old daughter, Hajar, who died in the malnutrition ward of a Sanaa, Yemen, hospital on Thursday, November 15.

Beto O'Rourke of Texas.\n\n\"We've worked many thousands of claims -- in that ballpark. We've focused on older claims, especially over the last two months, to make sure those numbers have come down, and they have come down,\" he added.\n\nDuring a White House event Thursday afternoon, Trump cited the expansion of the GI Bill as a point of success in his administration's efforts to modernize the VA.\n\n\"(A) crucial element to our veterans agenda is improved access to education. Last year, I signed legislation to allow every veteran to use their GI Bill education benefits at any point in their lives,\" he said.\n\nBut the scene on Capitol Hill did not reflect the progress Trump sought to portray.\n\nGrilled by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, VA officials were able to provide little clarity as to when the IT problems will be fixed, how much the issue is costing US taxpayers and how many veterans will be severely affected.\n\n\"I'm asking myself, are we destined to live with these IT problems regardless of how much taxpayer money we invest? It's embarrassing. It's shameful,\" Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, told the panel.\n\nO'Rourke echoed that concern and highlighted the need to establish a firm timeline to resolve the issues.\n\n\"Not having a deadline going forward is a recipe for disaster if I've ever heard one,\" he said.\n\nThe details that were provided, however, offered little encouragement to lawmakers who laid bare their frustrations over a myriad of issues facing the second-largest federal agency and prompted Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, to call efforts to overhaul the VA an \"exercise in futility.\"\n\n\"We're frustrated. We feel powerless up here because we've given you money, given you authority, asked you if you needed anything else. The veterans, I think, feel powerless, too. They're trapped in this bureaucracy and can't get out of it,\" he said.\n\nVA officials did little to reassure lawmakers that the department's leadership is doing enough to address the problem.\n\n\"This administration promised to clean up the culture of bureaucratic incompetence inside the VA. Based on this testimony today, I don't think they've made a lick of difference,\" said Rep. Mike Coffman, a sentiment echoed by the Colorado Republican's colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOne of the major issues raised by lawmakers was that of accountability at the VA, despite the presence of top department officials at the hearing.\n\nEarlier Thursday, an aide working for the committee confirmed to CNN that Worley, one of the key witnesses called to testify, had been reassigned prior to his appearance on the Hill.\n\nWorley still presented his testimony but members of the subcommittee suggested that his appearance was merely an effort to deflect attention from those who should truly be held responsible.\n\n\"We have heard that Worley has been looking to leave for a while, so it looks like VA is just using his preplanned departure as a way to save face over the GI Bill fiasco by pointing to him as someone they got rid of,\" the same committee aide told CNN, echoing comments from various lawmakers including the potential incoming chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat from California.\n\n\"There were a lot more people responsible for this than just Rob Worley,\" the aide said, questioning why other officials had not been held accountable as well.\n\nNBC News first reported on the payment process and Worley's reassignment.\n\nVA spokesperson Curtis Cashour said that Worley \"has been selected for a senior executive service position as executive director of the Houston VA Regional Office\" but will \"continue to serve as executive director of VA's Education Service until early January.\"\n\nHe also noted that Worley \"chose to take this opportunity to lead in a challenging capacity after his years of service at VA central office.\"\n\nBut both Republicans and Democrats on the subcommittee made clear that they wanted to hear from the individual leading the VA's Office of Information Technology, Camilo Sandoval -- who's also the former director of data operations for Trump's 2016 campaign. Sandoval came to the VA after working at the Treasury Department and reportedly clashing with staff there.\n\nThe VA did not respond to CNN's inquiry asking if Sandoval would comply should lawmakers call him to testify under oath."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Andrea Lo, CNN Business", "title": "Why this entrepreneur ditched architecture for chocolate", "description": "After graduating with a degree in architecture, Vicki Chandler was ready to do something \"hands-on.\"", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/business/la-iguana-chocolate-costa-rica/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181030153804-04-la-iguana-super-tease.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:39:51Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN Business) After graduating with a degree in architecture in the United Kingdom, Vicki Chandler was ready to do something \"hands on.\"\n\nSo when a friend asked her to help design a house in Costa Rica, she jumped at the chance.

The McCain team felt they needed to 'do something disruptive'\n\nSchmidt knew the McCain campaign had to make a strategically bold choice in order to \"have any chance in the election against Barack Obama,\" who he viewed as \"the heavyweight champ\" heading into 2008 presidential debates.\n\nLeaning into McCain's time in the military was one way, according to Schmidt, that the campaign could have a serious chance.\n\n\"My idea was that John McCain was going to go out and say, 'I put the uniform of my country on when I was 17 years old.' \"\n\nThis \"disruptive\" strategy included, in Schmidt's opinion, making a bold promise.\n\n\"What he would have said was, 'I promise to serve for only four years. We will fix these problems. ... Barack Obama is a good man, and I think, I know, he'll be president of the United States someday. He surely will, but he's not ready quite yet.' \"\n\n2. Palin wasn't 'fully vetted,' according to Schmidt\n\n\"To this day, the people in charge of vetting her insist the vet was full, it was complete and it was well done. ... Three days after we pick her, I found out she doesn't know where Iraq and Afghanistan are on a map. She doesn't know that Iraq didn't attack us on 9/11.\"\n\nSchmidt said he wasn't a part of the vetting process himself, which he acknowledges today as a \"mistake\" and \"regret.\"\n\nMcCain had invited Schmidt to join one of his last conversations with Palin before confirming her as his running mate, but Schmidt declined, telling McCain it was \"completely inappropriate.\"\n\n\"They went off for an hour. He came out. No person alive except for Sarah Palin knows what was said, what was talked about in that meeting. I wish I did.\"\n\n3. Schmidt became critical of Palin\n\nLooking back, Schmidt said that to this day he is \"sickened by (Palin) now at a psychological level and a character level, the constant lying, all of it.\"\n\n\"Palin is the first professional victim in an era where victimization becomes the lifeblood of the Republican Party, where it becomes virtuous,\" he said.\n\nSchmidt saw Palin as \"unfit\" to be vice president, an example being the way she responded to the crowds at rallies.\n\n\"She wasn't purposefully divisive, because she was too ignorant to be so. She was just transactionally exploitive. She was drawn to the fame. ... She wanted to be a celebrity. The campaign made her famous.\"\n\n4. Schmidt doesn't regret his falling out with McCain\n\nSchmidt, along with several of his colleagues, was not invited to McCain's funeral, which left him \"humiliated.\"\n\n\"More than any other person I have met, he was my inspiration to stand up, damn the consequences, and fight for what you believe in, and do what you think is the right thing to do. What I thought the right thing to do was to talk honestly and openly about (Palin's) manifest unfitness.\"\n\nHe says his outspokenness about Palin is what led to the \"rupture\" of his relationship with McCain. But he doesn't regret it.\n\n\"As painful as it may have been, I would do it again, and again, and again, and again. ... And the cost of a relationship that was amongst the deepest and most intimate that I'll ever have in my life was a profoundly painful thing.

But equally, he's also always had a good memory for figures -- for the pounds, shillings and pence. As a student at London's Royal College of Art, he remembers selling a drawing to a friend and fellow student, the American painter Ron Kitaj, for a princely \u00a35. It meant that he could buy cigarettes in packs of 20. He sold another early painting, \"Adhesiveness\" (1960), to photographer Cecil Beaton for \u00a340. That meant he could begin planning to travel abroad.\n\nAs it happens, Hockney also has a clear memory of what \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" originally fetched shortly after he painted it. On Thursday, at a Christie's auction in New York , the painting was sold for $90.3 million, an auction record for a living artist. But back in 1972, his New York dealer sold it for just $18,000.\n\n\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" (1972) by David Hockney Credit: Courtesy Christie's\n\nFor Hockney, the memory is still bittersweet. He felt ripped off. Last year, at his studio in the Hollywood Hills, he told CNN, \"I thought it was a lot of money at the time, but within six months, it was sold again for $50,000.\"\n\nAfter the sale, Hockney's American dealer, Andre Emmerich, \"realized the pictures (in the show) were underpriced. A lot had been underpriced.\" But by then, it was too late. And so, as is often the case in the art market, someone other than the artist made a swift and substantial profit.\n\nHockney at 80: An encounter with the artist\n\nMore is known about the creation of \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" than virtually any other single Hockney painting. The 1974 biopic \"A Bigger Splash\" chronicled its creation, and Hockney himself wrote about the painting in detail in 1988's \"David Hockney by David Hockney: My Early Years.\"\n\n\"A Bigger Splash\" was shot from 1971 to 1973 by British director Jack Hazan, who was given special access to Hockney, then living and working in London's Notting Hill, and his inner circle. A mix of fact and fiction, it centers on the painful unraveling of Hockney's five-year relationship with a young American artist, Peter Schlesinger.\n\nHockney told CNN the painting was inspired by an accidental juxtaposition of \"two photographs on my studio floor, one of the Peter and another of a swimmer, and they were just lying there and I put them together.\" In his 1988 memoir, \"David Hockney by David Hockney: My Early Years,\" he wrote: \"The idea of painting two figures in different styles appealed so much that I began the painting immediately.\"\n\nHe worked on the picture for six solid months. The standing figure was always Peter Schlesinger. According to his official biographer, Christopher Simon Sykes, Hockney painted the swimmer first but then coated the canvas with a preparatory gesso, which prevented him from altering the position of the pool or the standing figure. It was a mistake.\n\nHockney gradually realized the painting -- in particular, the angle of the swimming pool -- just wasn't right. He wrote that, \"The figures never related to one another nor to the background. I changed the setting constantly from distant mountains to a claustrophobic wall and back again to mountains. I even tried a glass wall.\"\n\nDavid Hockney in his Hollywood Hills studio in 2017.\n\nRealizing the futility of his efforts, Hockney abandoned that effort and, reinvigorated, started the painting all over again. He chose a new setting, a pool by a house in the south of France that belonged to British film director Tony Richardson. He took two models with him: a photographer named John St. Clair and Mo McDermott, his studio assistant.\n\nHe took hundreds of photos of the two. St. Clair, the submerged swimmer, dived into the pool in his white briefs so many times that he eventually cracked his head on the bottom and had to stop. McDermott acted as Schlesinger's stand-in, wearing his reddish pink jacket by the pool. Back in London, Hockney persuaded Schlesinger to pose for him early one morning in Hyde Park for yet more photos.\n\nPeter Schlesinger and artist David Hockney standing in front of a photograph of themselves at a 1969 exhibition in London. Credit: Patrick Lichfield/Conde Nast Collection Editorial\n\nOnce back at his Notting Hill studio, Hockney painted for 18 hours a day on a canvas seven feet by 10. At one point, Hockney is filmed taking a Polaroid of the unfinished painting. At another moment, he paints in Schlesinger's brown hair with a long brush. \"I must admit that I loved working on that picture, working with such intensity,\" he later told biographer Sykes. \"It was marvelous doing it, really thrilling.\"\n\nWhile he spent six months of the first version, the final \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" was finished in just two weeks, to meet a deadline for a New York show in May 1972. In \"A Bigger Splash,\" Hockney, with his trademark bleached blond hair and black, owlish spectacles, stands in bright red braces and a bow tie, carefully checking out how the painting was hung and lit in the show. It was the star exhibit, perhaps an expression of Hockney's personal loss and his acceptance that his long affair with Schlesinger was finally over.\n\nWhy is art so expensive?\n\nBut as we now know, all this wasn't without a sense of Hockney feeling cheated by what happened next. An American, apparently alerted by a British dealer, just came in off the street and bought it. The dealer then promptly took it to an art fair in Germany and sold it to a London collector for nearly three times the price. As he wrote in \"My Early Years\": \"Within a year people had made far more on that picture than Kasmin (John Kasmin, his London dealer), Andre (Emmerich, his New York dealer) or I had. Considering the effort and trouble and everything that had gone into it, it seemed such a cheap thing to do.\"\n\nWe can only imagine how Hockney will feel after this sale, when the painting he worked so hard on has sold for more than 5,000 times its original price. The current seller and the auction house will no doubt profit, but, as a Christie's spokesperson confirmed, \"the artist will not be financially benefiting.\"\n\nChristie's hasn't named the seller, but he's believed to be British businessman Joe Lewis, who has famously collected postwar British art for some time.\n\nAt 81, Lewis happens to be the same age as Hockney. He also has a net worth of $5 billion."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Gregory Krieg and Annie Grayer, CNN", "title": "Broward County recounted hundreds of thousands of votes for nothing", "description": "It's a long-agonized-over machine recount total delivered two minutes too late.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/politics/broward-county-recount-didnt-count/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115194842-broward-county-counts-damaged-ballots-1114-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:56:08Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) It's a long-agonized-over machine recount total delivered two minutes too late.\n\nBut there's nothing ironic about it -- this is, after all, Florida's Broward County, which has been plagued with issues in its vote-counting efforts for years.\n\nGiven that history, it was unsurprising -- but still galling to volunteers -- when the director of elections here revealed that the county had submitted its machine recount data two minutes after the state-mandated 3 p.m. Thursday deadline.\n\nThe secretary of state's office did not accept the new numbers and so, after days of painstaking work, Broward's count Thursday remained the same as it was on Saturday, when it submitted its initial unofficial election results.\n\n\"Basically, I just worked my ass off for nothing,\" said Joe D'Alessandro, the director of elections for Broward County.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Kevin Liptak, CNN", "title": "Pence takes a global role as Trump broods", "description": "One is huddling with the Russian President, gripping-and-grinning with the Japanese prime minister and pressing Myanmar's ruler to free imprisoned journalists.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/politics/mike-pence-donald-trump-foreign-policy/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180925134948-mike-pence-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:52:49Z", "content": "(CNN) One is huddling with the Russian President, gripping-and-grinning with the Japanese prime minister and pressing Myanmar's ruler to free imprisoned journalists.

Trump, who attended the gatherings last year but departed early, sent his No. 2 instead.\n\n\"Overall, it's just a very bad optic when we don't show up,\" said Victor Cha, senior adviser and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who was considered for an ambassadorship to South Korea in the Trump administration. \"(Pence will) be there. And there are small things that they'll be doing. But the overall message is going to be there's disinterest and it's not a priority. And that's not good, given the broader context of what's happening in Asia.\"\n\nUS officials have insisted that Trump's absence from the summits doesn't amount to a snub. Pence told a gathering on Wednesday that he'd just spoken to the President by phone and he \"asked me to convey his regards and greetings and appreciation to each of you.\"\n\nAnd US presidents have missed the gatherings in the past, though for last-minute reasons, such as a government shutdown, and not as a planned non-appearance.\n\nStill, with Trump deciding to skip this year's summits, other leaders have sought to fill the void. Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Singapore to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and East Asia Summit meetings, where he worked to strengthen economic and military ties in the region. Chinese President Xi Jinping is planning to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea, hoping to advance Beijing's influence in the South Pacific.\n\nPence is there, too, but without the draw of being his country's No. 1.\n\nReclaim his standing\n\nTrump will have an opportunity to reclaim his global standing in two weeks, when he travels to Argentina for two days of meetings at the G20 summit, including with the presidents of China and Russia. But for now it is Pence doing the talking while Trump has largely withdrawn.\n\nThat's a marked shift from before the midterm elections, when the President was traveling constantly to promote Republican candidates at loud, hour-long rallies. He conducted a string of interviews and stopped at nearly every opportunity to speak with journalists as he was coming and going from the White House.\n\nNow, Trump is remaining mostly quiet. He scrapped a planned trip to the southern border this week, officials said. His public schedule has been relatively light, though he'll preside over a Medal of Freedom ceremony on Friday and tour fire damage in California on Saturday. The President has met the last three days with his attorneys to discuss written responses to special counsel Robert Mueller , according to a source familiar with the matter, including a meeting Wednesday night with Rudy Giuliani.\n\nHe sat for a friendly interview with The Daily Caller on Wednesday , but has not engaged in a public back and forth with reporters for nearly a week. He last took questions from the press corps on Friday, ahead of his visit to Paris.\n\nEven abroad, Trump eschewed a heavy itinerary of diplomacy with the world leaders gathered in the French capital to commemorate the World War I armistice. He met only with his host, French President Emmanuel Macron, and held short informal discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\nFor hours on Saturday afternoon, Trump was without any official activities after a planned visit to an American cemetery outside Paris was canceled because of rain. Instead, he remained at the US ambassador's residence getting updates on election recounts commencing back home and watching television. As they have on previous foreign swings, staffers had ensured that televisions inside the ambassador's residence -- the second empire H\u00f4tel de Pontalba on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 -- had Fox News available for the President's viewing.\n\nTrump grumbled that he was kept away from the action back home, where election recounts were getting underway in key Senate and governors' races. With nothing to do for six hours in the middle of the afternoon, Trump demanded updates on the races and details about the state officials responsible for the counting.\n\nThe scrapped cemetery visit sparked virulent backlash, with some of Trump's critics suggesting he wasn't willing to brave the inclement weather to honor fallen American troops. The White House insisted that was not the case, citing logistical and security concerns that prevented the President from traveling to the site.\n\nImage of a military-minded leader\n\nAfter the controversy, Trump has worked to fortify his image as a military-minded leader. He visited Marines at their barracks in Washington on Thursday before delivering remarks at the White House laying out the steps his administration has taken to support veterans.\n\nBut if there was one person holding the mantle of US statesmanship this week, it has been Pence, who met in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe before traveling to Singapore and onward to Australia and Papua New Guinea for the summit talks.\n\nHe's taken on hefty diplomatic tasks, such as confronting Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi over the treatment of her country's stateless Rohingya Muslim population. Even as back home the White House was going to court over the suspension of CNN reporter Jim Acosta's credentials, Pence pressed Suu Kyi over the imprisonment of two Reuters journalists.\n\n\"I look forward to speaking to you about the premium that we place on a free and independent press,\" Pence told Suu Kyi ahead of their talks.\n\nLater, cameras caught Pence in intense conversation with Putin, with national security adviser John Bolton between them. Bolton had traveled with Pence to Asia rather than remain behind in Washington with Trump. In his absence, Trump dismissed his deputy Mira Ricardel. Pence raised the 2016 election meddling with Putin, aides said.\n\nLater this week he travels onward to Papua New Guinea for the APEC meetings, where Xi will take center stage. Like every year, leaders will pose for a photo in a traditional shirt. But for the first time since 2013 -- when Obama canceled a planned appearance in Bali because of a government shutdown -- the US president won't be there.\n\nAt last year's APEC meeting in Vietnam, the event's organizers faced a last minute scramble to change the color of a giant onstage screen from orange to blue after American officials raised urgent concerns the the President would disappear if he stood in front of the electronic, apricot-hued screen.\n\nWith no Trump, they're breathing easier this year."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Eric Bradner, CNN", "title": "Hyde-Smith appears to joke that making it harder for students to vote is a 'great idea'", "description": "Mississippi Republican Sen.

It was a routine as ingrained in him as brushing his teeth, and it nearly cost him his life.\n\nOn a morning in February 2014, Lau -- a senior editor at the popular, upmarket daily Ming Pao -- had parked his car on a street near the restaurant when two men, wearing motorcycle helmets and gloves, rushed up to him. One slashed at Lau with a meat cleaver, knocking him to the floor, where he lay bleeding with deep wounds in his back and legs as his assailants ran off.\n\nWith what a court later described as \"superhuman calm,\" Lau phoned for an ambulance, and was rushed to hospital. He survived, and two men with triad links -- Yip Kim-wah and Wong Chi-wah -- were arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm.\n\nWhile Yip and Wong were later jailed, they did not reveal who had commissioned and paid for the attack, one of several against journalists in Hong Kong at that time, including the firebombing of the home and office of Jimmy Lai, publisher of the Apple Daily, a tabloid highly critical of the Chinese government.\n\nIn the wake of the attack against Lau, several thousand journalists and supporters took to the streets , dressed in black and carrying banners which read \"They Can't Kill Us All\" in a defiant show of support for press freedom in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.\n\nIt was a tense period for journalists in Hong Kong. The sense of despair was lifted, temporarily, by the so-called Umbrella Revolution mass pro-democracy protests that broke out in late 2014. Those demonstrations saw the international media spotlight swing onto Hong Kong, and the local press rose to the challenge, covering every aspect of the protests and their fallout, and winning multiple awards in the process.\n\nIndeed, in the wake of the protests, reporters' assessment of press freedom in the city rose for the first time in years, according to the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA)\n\nBut just as the Umbrella protests eventually gave way to widespread disillusionment, as hoped for reforms never panned out, and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures were jailed, recent weeks have seen a collapse in confidence among the city's small journalist community, and renewed fears of self-censorship, prosecution and violence.\n\nOn November 9 this year, the HKJA warned of the \"death knell of freedom of speech\" in the city.\n\nProtesters display placards during a rally to support press freedom in Hong Kong on March 2, 2014.\n\nKeeping quiet\n\nUnder Hong Kong's de facto constitution, the Basic Law, residents are guaranteed \"freedom of speech, of the press and of publication,\" rights that are not granted, or protected in mainland China.\n\nWhile this means there is little top-down control of media in Hong Kong, self-censorship within the local press has been widely reported, both by front-line reporters and editors who have left publications they felt were unwilling to stand up to the government or corporate pressure.\n\nOne of the best descriptions of self-censorship, and its pernicious power which sometimes outstrips that of more aggressive control, comes from China scholar Perry Link\n\n\"(The) government's censorial authority in recent times has resembled not so much a man-eating tiger or fire-snorting dragon as a giant anaconda coiled in an overhead chandelier,\" Link wrote about academic self-censorship in China.\n\n\"Normally the great snake doesn't move. It doesn't have to. It feels no need to be clear about its prohibitions. Its constant silent message is 'You yourself decide,' after which, more often than not, everyone in its shadow makes his or her large and small adjustments -- all quite 'naturally'.\"\n\nWhile mainland China has a massive formal censorship apparatus, controlling all aspects of society from movies and music, to the Internet and book publishing, much of what affects people on a day to day level is closer to self-censorship.\n\nSocial media firms, for example, employ hundreds of censors to police what their users say, but for the most part, they do so without guidance or direction from the central government, second guessing what their bosses, and by extension the Communist Party's official censors will disapprove of.\n\nIn this context, self-censorship becomes more effective the more unclear the boundaries, and the greater the repercussions for potentially stepping across them.\n\nThis could be seen in Hong Kong in the wake of the attack on Lau, as the chance of a violent response to a story suddenly seemed a real possibility to many reporters, compounding existing fears about the \"wrong\" story costing the journalist their job or resulting in costly legal proceedings.\n\nFor over a decade, however, even as warnings grew about self-censorship by Hong Kong reporters, and media ownership was consolidated by a few China-friendly businesspeople, the foreign press has largely operated unfettered, a stark contrast to China, where international reporters regularly harassed, ejected from the country, and their local colleagues arrested and jailed.\n\nThat all changed this year.\n\nPeople raise pro-China signs in a protest against Hong Kong independence in front of the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Hong Kong on August 14, 2018.\n\nAction reaction\n\nThe Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong is positioned half way up a hill on a busy, windy road with narrow pavements and multiple lanes in the city's Central district.\n\nIt's not a good venue to protest outside of, and yet, in August several dozen people squeezed themselves into police cordoned-off areas opposite and next to the club, bearing banners accusing the elite institution of being involved in a \"conspiracy to split Hong Kong from China.\"\n\nInside, the focus of the protests, Andy Chan, sat looking calm and composed as he prepared to give a speech arguing for the city's independence . He chatted casually with FCC staff, and laughed when fire department officials rushed into the building carrying axes in response to an apparent hoax call.\n\nWithin days of the event taking place, Chan's Hong Kong National Party was officially banned under public security laws, the first time they had ever been used to go after a political organization. The FCC itself, meanwhile, was facing a storm of publicity amid calls for it to lose the lease to its property and potentially even its license to operate.\n\nVictor Mallet, a Financial Times journalist and vice president of the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) (right) speaks with Andy Chan, founder of the Hong Kong National Party, during a luncheon at the FCC in Hong Kong.\n\nBy October, those fears appeared misguided, until Victor Mallet, an editor at the Financial Times who had hosted Chan in his capacity as acting-FCC President, put in for a routine visa renewal.\n\nCompared to China and many other countries in the region (including ones which boast about being democracies), Hong Kong is an incredibly easy place to get a journalist visa, but Mallet had his refused , an almost unprecedented move the government has yet to explain but nearly everyone else has connected to the Chan talk.\n\nWhile the local government has consistently denied that Mallet's ejection was anything to do with press freedom, the failure to provide an alternate explanation, as well as the facts of the case, have left most to draw their own conclusions.\n\n\"We ... are deeply concerned that with this action, taken with no stated or apparent legal basis, Hong Kong's special place as a bastion of free expression and a free press has been eroded,\" 17 former presidents of the FCC wrote in an open letter to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam after Mallet was denied entry to the city as a visitor on November 8\n\nJUST WATCHED China exports its model of internet sovereignty Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China exports its model of internet sovereignty 02:31\n\nNew normal\n\nWhile reporters working in mainland China are obviously subject to the pressures and concerns that can lead to self-censorship -- fear of violence, fear of being ejected from the country or even jailed -- there is an additional factor in Hong Kong, in that the city has long been a place where many expats, including foreign reporters, are more like immigrants, getting permanent residency and raising their children, rather than moving on after a few years.\n\nBeing ejected from a country one never had any intention of living in can, though most journalists would not admit it, be a boon to career prospects, significantly building the reporter's profile and reputation. But being forced to leave somewhere you intended to raise your family and settle down can be devastating, and questions naturally arise over whether any given story, or event, or interview, is worth that?\n\nRecent weeks have seen two incidents which appear from the outside to be clear cut cases of self-censorship.\n\nThe specter of the attack on Lau, as well as the 2015 disappearance of several Hong Kong booksellers , was raised on November 2, when the organizers of a show by Chinese dissident artist Badiucao canceled the event , a day before it was due to take place, alleging \"threats made by the Chinese authorities relating to the artist.\"\n\nThis was followed by the cancellation of a talk by another Chinese exile, novelist Ma Jian, at Tai Kwun, an art space which has received government funding, as part of a series of events connected to the Hong Kong International Literary Festival.\n\nIn a statement, the Director of Tai Kwun, Timothy Calnin, said organizers \"do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual.\"\n\n\"The cancellation appears to be at the very least an act of self-censorship, which would add to a growing list of incidents of suppression of free expression in Hong Kong,\" said Jason Y. Ng, president of PEN Hong Kong, a pro-free speech organization.\n\n\"It is all the more jarring that the decision was made by a publicly funded venue that claims to celebrate and support the arts and creativity,\" added Ng.\n\nChinese author Ma Jian speaks to the press upon his arrival at Hong Kong International Airport on November 9, 2018.\n\nThe self-censorship charge appeared to be confirmed when Tai Kwun abruptly reversed its decision and agreed to host Ma after all.\n\n\"Ma has made public statements which clarify that his appearances in Hong Kong are as a novelist and that he has no intention to use Tai Kwun as a platform to promote his personal political interests,\" Calnin said in a statement.\n\nOver all of this -- Mallet's visa refusal, Badiucao's cancelled show, Andy Chan's banned party, and all the protests and demonstrations they inspired -- hangs a long delayed anti-sedition provision contained within the Basic Law, the city's de facto constitution.\n\nArticle 23 of Basic Law instructs the local government to \"enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government ... and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies.\"\n\nAttempts to implement the law in 2003 sparked massive street protests which eventually saw it shelved, but it has remained a priority of the central government and current leader Carrie Lam has vowed to create \"suitable conditions\" for passing the law, though she has not outlined any timetable.\n\nWhile the Hong Kong government has shown it is not lacking in powers to go after protesters or dampen expression, Article 23 would massively expand the amount of forbidden topics in a city already nervous about its freedoms, and possibly even end its role as a hub for international media in Asia.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Tai Kwun event , Ma Jian said people nevertheless need to \"have the courage to break\" through self-censorship.\n\n\"The freedom to speak is the basis of our civilization,\" he added. \"We have to safeguard our freedom of expression. We have to safeguard our civilization.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "herbertholguin", "title": "\u00bfC\u00f3mo votaron los latinos en las elecciones intermedias de Estados Unidos?", "description": "Nuestro columnista Alberto Montaner brinda un panorama del voto latino en los m\u00e1s recientes comicios de Estados Unidos.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/15/estados-unidos-elecciones-intermedias-latinos-como-votaron-opinion-montaner/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/181101154421-bpt101-election-early-voting-11012018-full-169.jpg?quality=100&strip=info&w=1200", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:41:05Z", "content": "Nota del editor: Carlos Alberto Montaner es escritor y analista pol\u00edtico de CNN.

Bruce Poliquin, marking the 33rd seat pickup for Democrats in the 2018 election.\n\nThere are seven races in the House left uncalled -- all are Republican-held seats; Democrats lead in five of the seven. If they win all the races where their candidates are winning at the moment, Democrats will net 38 seats. If they lose them all -- which is very unlikely -- they will hold at a 33-seat gain.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with the conservative Daily Caller website , President Donald Trump insisted that by his aggressive last-minute campaigning across the country he had saved House Republicans from seat losses that could have numbered into the 70s. \"I think I did very well,\" he concluded.\n\nSo did he? As compared to history?\n\nNot really, is the answer.\n\nThere's no question that Trump did not suffer the massive seat loss that his immediate predecessor -- Barack Obama -- did in his first midterm election in 2010. In that election, Republicans netted an astounding 63-seat gain, the largest since Democrats lost 72 House seats in the 1938 midterms.\n\nBut more broadly, the 33 seat loss (at least) by Republicans in 2018 places this election firmly in the upper echelon of House-seat losses by a president's party in modern midterms.\n\nSince Watergate, the president's party has lost more than 33 seats three times: 2010 (63 seats), 1994 (54) and 1974 (48). In that same time frame, the president's party has lost fewer than 33 seats eight times: 2014 (13), 2006 (30), 2002 (president's party won eight seats), 1998 (president's party won five seats), 1990 (eight), 1986 (five), 1982 (26) and 1978 (15).\n\nThe Point: It's fair to say the 2018 election wasn't a complete and total disaster for Republicans, but it was far from a nothing burger either. If 1 is calm political waters and 10 is a tsunami, I think the 2018 election is rightly described between 7.5-8.5."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Make this your most fashion-forward holiday season with The Outnet's massive sale on designer clothes", "description": "Shop designer clothing on a budget during The Outnet's Thanksgiving sale.

Solo basta ver la reacci\u00f3n del mercado de valores desde la tarde de ese d\u00eda. La rueda de prensa de Donald Trump y lo que pas\u00f3 con el periodista Acosta de CNN fue claramente una verg\u00fcenza. Horas m\u00e1s tarde Donald Trump desped\u00eda a su secretario de justicia, Jeff Sessions.\n\nLEE: 7 lecciones que nos dejan las elecciones intermedias en EE.UU.\n\nEl presidente est\u00e1 en su derecho en pedir la renuncia a cualquier miembro de su gabinete. Ese no es el problema. El problema es que ese miembro del gabinete estaba a cargo de supervisar al departamento que lleva la investigaci\u00f3n especial del fiscal Robert Mueller sobre la interferencia rusa, o de Putin, para ser m\u00e1s exactos, en la \u00faltima elecci\u00f3n presidencial.\n\nEn dichos comicios particip\u00f3 Donald Trump. Algunos de los miembros de su campa\u00f1a ya est\u00e1n enjuiciados y otros han admitido su participaci\u00f3n en esa interferencia u otros delitos. Esa investigaci\u00f3n que dirige Mueller no ha terminado a\u00fan. Ya lleva cerca de dos a\u00f1os, y de acuerdo con una norma no escrita en EE.UU., ning\u00fan juez o investigador hace p\u00fablico su trabajo durante el proceso electoral cuando \u00e9ste tiene acusados o sospechosos de cualquier delito investigado que sean candidatos (Comey rompi\u00f3 esa tradici\u00f3n con Hillary Clinton a menos de dos semanas de la elecci\u00f3n presidencial). Nadie sabe qu\u00e9 tan avanzado o listo est\u00e1 Mueller para terminar su investigaci\u00f3n, pero es posible, a partir del abrupto despido del Secretario de Justicia, que el resultado no favorezca a Trump.\n\nCada pol\u00edtico (y comentarista) es libre de tener sus propias interpretaciones de los hechos; pero actuar en funci\u00f3n de dichas interpretaciones es siempre un riesgo. Si la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller no va a traer mayores consecuencias para el Presidente, no se explica el despido de Sessions en medio de una investigaci\u00f3n tan delicada que involucra su campa\u00f1a. Pero nadie excepto Mueller sabe cu\u00e1ndo terminar\u00e1 su investigaci\u00f3n y qu\u00e9 contiene. Sin conocer ese resultado, no podremos saber el nivel de confrontaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica entre el Congreso y el Presidente. Y el nivel de confrontaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica determinar\u00e1 la din\u00e1mica y el resultado pol\u00edtico de los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os, incluyendo la pr\u00f3xima elecci\u00f3n.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, \u00bfqu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1 con la econom\u00eda? La mayor\u00eda de los economistas consideran que hay ciclos econ\u00f3micos. El \u00faltimo comenz\u00f3 luego de la recuperaci\u00f3n de la crisis del 2008 y ha venido recuper\u00e1ndose los \u00faltimos tres o cuatro a\u00f1os hasta alcanzar ahora el pleno empleo efectivo. Esta recuperaci\u00f3n sin duda fue impulsada hace un a\u00f1o con la reducci\u00f3n de impuestos que aprobaron los Republicanos. \u00bfCu\u00e1nto ox\u00edgeno m\u00e1s tiene esta recuperaci\u00f3n? Si son menos de dos a\u00f1os, sin duda afectar\u00e1 al escenario pol\u00edtico y al Presidente.\n\nEntonces, \u00bfqui\u00e9n gan\u00f3 la elecci\u00f3n? Los dem\u00f3cratas ganaron en la \u00fanica elecci\u00f3n en todo el territorio nacional. \u00bfQu\u00e9 nos dice esta elecci\u00f3n? Que el pa\u00eds sigue igual de polarizado y confrontado. Que el elector pide que se baje el volumen de la disputa pol\u00edtica. Por eso, la mayor\u00eda de los que ganaron fueron moderados y dem\u00f3cratas moderados ganaron en territorios hist\u00f3ricamente republicanos.\n\nEl gran desarrollo de la tecnolog\u00eda y las redes sociales han incrementado el ruido pol\u00edtico. Hemos agregado comunidades virtuales que antes estaban aisladas y ahora est\u00e1n agrupadas en las redes virtuales, que aumentan su visibilidad y expresi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica radical. Pero como naci\u00f3n hemos optado por bajar su voz y respaldar a los moderados. Los votos de los republicanos se ven acorralados por la urbanizaci\u00f3n, diversificaci\u00f3n, globalizaci\u00f3n y crecimiento poblacional (solo ganaron, y por poco, en hombres blancos, especialmente en los mayores de 35 a\u00f1os). La participaci\u00f3n y triunfo de las mujeres ha sido un \u00e9xito. Ocupar\u00e1n un n\u00famero r\u00e9cord de asientos en el Congreso. La nueva c\u00e1mara ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s representativa de la poblaci\u00f3n y m\u00e1s diversa.\n\nEst\u00e1 claro qui\u00e9n gan\u00f3. Pero el ganador dentro de dos a\u00f1os depender\u00e1 de la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller y de la evoluci\u00f3n de la recuperaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica. M\u00e1s que especular sobre estos dos hechos, prefiero observarlos con detenimiento para poder hacer mis apuestas de nuevo."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Alex Rogers and Jeremy Herb, CNN", "title": "Schumer deflects claims that he pushed colleagues to go easy on Facebook", "description": "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer defended himself Thursday against a report that he encouraged his colleagues to go easy on Facebook amid investigations into the social media giant's role in spreading Russian misinformation.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/politics/facebook-schumer-russia-warner/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180716150655-chuck-schumer-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:02:41Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer defended himself Thursday against a report that he encouraged his colleagues to go easy on Facebook amid investigations into the social media giant's role in spreading Russian misinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSchumer spokesman Justin Goodman said in a statement Thursday that the New York senator \"has worked aggressively to push Facebook to do more to purge fake accounts and bots used by the right wing and Russians to perpetuate a disinformation campaign and interfere with our elections.\"\n\n\"Schumer has worried that Facebook would bow to pressure from Republicans, who oppose the purging of the fake accounts and bots, and has urged Senator Warner and the Senate Intelligence committee to make this the priority in their ongoing investigation of the company,\" Goodman added.\n\nWarner declined to answer questions about the Times' claims on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about any private conversations I had with the leader,\" Warner told reporters. \"He was very aware of the fact that our committee has been relentless, and has still got a lot of questions that need to get answered.\"\n\nHe added that the Times' description of Facebook's efforts to sidestep questions about Russian meddling efforts conducted via its platforms, including Instagram, validated congressional inquiries.\n\n\"Frankly, but for the Intelligence inquiry and constant pressure, I think we would be even more in the dark,\" Warner said. \"And I'm happy to see that there's greater cooperation now, but clearly this was the case as we suspected that for a number of months, they just hoped this problem was going away.\"\n\nWarner's House intelligence committee counterpart, California Rep. Adam Schiff, told CNN that he didn't know whether the claims about Schumer are \"accurate or not.\"\n\nSchiff added that he \"certainly\" intends to talk to Facebook about the Times' \"concerning\" report.\n\n\"They were obviously slow to come to grips with what the Russians were doing on their platform and the misuse of their platform,\" said Schiff. \"If they were deliberately slow to convey that information to us, that's deeply disturbing.\"\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters in a conference call Thursday that the company had been too slow to deal with the Russian disinformation problem on its platform in 2016, but said it was \"simply untrue\" to suggest that he and other executives \"weren't interested in knowing the truth.\"\n\nThe intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections in part by using social media platforms like Facebook changed the company's relationship with Washington.\n\nMany members of Congress appear to remain unsure of how to hold the company accountable. During Mark Zuckerberg's April hearing before senators -- the most high-profile showdown between Facebook and Washington -- some of the members of Congress seemed either unfamiliar with its business or to treat it with deference.\n\nSchumer has publicly been a Facebook fan.\n\n\"I think overall it's been a very positive force,\" said Schumer. \"I think now people are taking advantage of the openness of the net, and Facebook has an obligation to try and deal with it. I've talked to them. I truly believe they want to. I truly believe they know that their future is at stake with this. I also believe it's a hard thing to do.\""}]
