The committee is looking to hire money-laundering and forensic accounting experts.\u201d\n\n* Who loves the Republican tax plan? Banks do: \u201cThe U.S. banking industry\u2019s profits reached a record $62 billion during the third quarter, fueled in large part by a corporate tax cut, according to government data released Tuesday.\u201d\n\n* We\u2019re still waiting for a credible defense of the mission: \u201cThe probability that American border guards will face violence at the southwestern border is \u2018minimal,\u2019 an internal Homeland Security Department document has concluded, undercutting a Trump administration proposal to protect the security officials from migrant attacks by pairing them with military troops.\u201d\n\n* Putin will not be pleased: \u201cThe global law-enforcement body Interpol elected South Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-yang its new president Wednesday. Kim\u2019s election averts a crisis in the international police group because it thwarts efforts by Russia to lead Interpol.\u201d\n\n* Whether you care about the health care industry or not, this is one striking story: \u201cMillions of sleep apnea patients rely on CPAP breathing machines to get a good night\u2019s rest. Health insurers use a variety of tactics, including surveillance, to make patients bear the costs. Experts say it\u2019s part of the insurance industry playbook.\u201d\n\n* I\u2019ll assume this was a rhetorical question: \u201cDonald Trump knows who Time magazine should pick for 2018\u2019s Person of the Year award, and it\u2019s no surprise: Donald Trump\u2026. \u2018I can\u2019t imagine anybody other than Trump,\u2019 the president said, meaning himself. \u2018Can you imagine anybody other than Trump?\u2019\u201d\n\n* A literal turkey has spent more time on the White House press briefing room podium in November than has White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\n* A good decision: \u201cA week after claiming to be part of a \u2018master race,\u2019 a county commissioner in Kansas has announced his resignation.\u201d\n\nAnything to add?

Whitaker received more than $1.2 million as the leader of a charity that reported having no other employees, some of the best pay of his career. The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust described itself as a new watchdog nonprofit dedicated to exposing unethical conduct by public officials. For Whitaker, it became a lucrative steppingstone in a swift rise from a modest law practice in Iowa to the nation\u2019s top law enforcement job. As FACT\u2019s president, he regularly appeared on radio and television, often to skewer liberals.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, there\u2019s a good reason for that: it\u2019s maintained a low profile. One former FACT board member told the Post that the tax-exempt group, which changed its name several times and at one point listed its address as a UPS Store in Virginia, \u201conly existed on paper.\u201d\n\nMarcus Owens, who oversaw the IRS\u2019s exempt-organizations division for a decade, added that in its first years, the non-profit group appears to have been a \u201cshell charity\u201d that \u201cwas not utilized and remained on the shelf\u201d until Whitaker took the reins.\n\nNevertheless, the Republican lawyer used his FACT perch to make frequent media appearances, speaking on behalf of his \u201corganization,\u201d and repeating conservative talking points. All the while, Whitaker was well compensated by the tax-exempt entity.\n\nAnd it\u2019s this financing that\u2019s probably the most notable angle to the story: we have no idea who or what has donated to the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, which means we don\u2019t know who helped pay the acting attorney general $1.2 million.\n\nThe New York Times reported, \u201cThe disclosure raised questions about who Mr. Whitaker\u2019s financial patrons had been before he joined the Justice Department last year and whether he might have any undisclosed conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nAll of this, of course, is separate from the questions surrounding Whitaker\u2019s work with World Patent Marketing, which has been the subject of an FBI investigation, and which has been accused of being a \u201cscam\u201d operation.\n\nIn a way, Whitaker\u2019s broader plan was alarmingly successful: he became the executive director of a tax-exempt entity that paid him handsomely; he used this position to raise his media profile; and he used his appearances to condemn Democrats and Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This, naturally, caught Donald Trump\u2019s attention, and led to a Justice Department position.\n\nAs of two weeks ago, despite not having been confirmed by the Senate or vetted by the White House, Whitaker is the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official, despite being manifestly unqualified for the post.\n\nIt sure would be nice, though, to know where that $1.2 million came from.\n\nUpdate: OpenSecrets reported today., \u201cA single six-figure donor accounted for 100 percent of funding raised by a nonprofit run by acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker before he became Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff last year, new tax documents obtained by the Center for Responsive Politics reveal.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Big Question: What happens when there is no one left to tell the president no?", "description": "A new report by the New York Times details how President Trump tried to direct the Department of Justice to prosecute his political opponents, Hillary Clinton and James Comey, but White House counsel Don McGahn warned him not to.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/katy-tur/watch/what-happens-when-there-is-no-one-left-to-tell-the-president-no-1377250883524", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/n_tur_bigquestion_181121_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:06:11Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "What happens when there is no one left to tell the President no? copied!\n\nA new report by the New York Times details how President Trump tried to direct the Department of Justice to prosecute his political opponents, Hillary Clinton and James Comey, but White House counsel Don McGahn warned him not to.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Chief Justice Roberts denounces Trump's 'Obama judge' remarks", "description": "Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts criticized remarks made by President Trump who focused his legal upsets in federal court on a judge appointed by former President Obama.

Legal experts expected the policy to run into trouble in the courts.\n\nWhich is exactly what happened. U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar blocked the policy on Monday, explaining in a temporary restraining order, \u201cWhatever the scope of the President\u2019s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden.\u201d\n\nWhen reporters asked Donald Trump yesterday for his reaction, the president said, \u201cThis was an Obama judge. And I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s not going to happen like this anymore.\u201d Referring to the federal judiciary\u2019s 9th Circuit, which is widely seen as the most progressive circuit and where Tigar is located, Trump added, \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d\n\nThe comments apparently came to the attention of the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who was not pleased.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts is pushing back against President Donald Trump for his description of a judge who ruled against Trump\u2019s migrant asylum policy as an \u201cObama judge.\u201d It\u2019s the first time the Republican-appointed leader of the federal judiciary has offered even a hint of criticism of Trump, who has previously blasted federal judges who ruled against him. Roberts said Wednesday the U.S. doesn\u2019t have \u201cObama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.\u201d He commented in a statement released by the Supreme Court after a query by The Associated Press.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely unusual for the chief justice to make public comments like these, but in this case, it\u2019s not just Roberts\u2019 pushback against Trump that\u2019s striking; it\u2019s also his choice of venue.\n\nOnce in a while, a sitting Supreme Court justice will share a sentiment of note at an academic symposium or in a journal article, where it may or may not generate public attention. Today, however, John Roberts shared his concerns about the president\u2019s rhetoric with the Associated Press.\n\nIt suggests the chief justice made a deliberate choice to ensure that his statement generated some attention. Roberts didn\u2019t just want to rebuke Trump\u2019s rhetoric, he wanted everyone to know he was rebuking Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\nTo be sure, this week was not the first time this Republican president has taken cheap shots at his own country\u2019s judiciary. When his executive order on so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d for example, Trump questioned the authority of an \u201cunelected\u201d judge. When an early iteration of Trump\u2019s Muslim ban was struck down, he told the public that the United States\u2019 legal system is \u201cbroken.\u201d\n\nAs regular readers may recall, it was part of a series of related salvos \u2013 let\u2019s not forget the references to a \u201cso-called\u201d federal judge and his racist rhetoric about Judge Gonzalo Curiel in 2016 \u2013 in which Trump expressed contempt for the judiciary. He\u2019s even made the case that U.S. courts represent some kind of security threat.\n\nPerhaps, yesterday, John Roberts decided that he\u2019d seen enough."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MPX", "title": "Morning Joe 11/21/18", "description": "Joe and Mika discuss the big news of the day.", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/episodes/watch/morning-joe-11-21-18-episode", "urlToImage": "https://tve-static-msnbc.akamaized.net/j/image/535/819/181121_3833838_Morning_Joe_11_21_18_800x450_1377103427624.video_1067x600.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:31:01Z", "content": "Morning Joe 11/21/18 Joe and Mika discuss the big news of the day. descriptionLimit\"&gt;... more Duration: {{video.duration.momentjs}} Up next in: Morning Joe full episodes", "fulltext": "Joe and Mika discuss the big news of the day.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "California town hosting Thanksgiving meal for evacuees from Camp Fire", "description": "Residents of Lincoln, California, will be cooking and serving meals to families living in shelters after losing their entire town to the raging wildfires.

As regular readers may recall, it was a striking diplomatic move, and an escalation of tensions between the two countries, which seemed to warrant a stern White House response.\n\nAsked for his response, Donald Trump expressed his gratitude. \u201cI want to thank [Putin], because we\u2019re trying to cut down on payroll,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cAnd as far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m very thankful.\u201d\n\nSubstantively, this was effectively gibberish, but it was also a bizarre diplomatic posture: American presidents are not supposed to \u201cthank\u201d foreign governments after incidents in which they act against the United States.\n\nThis came to mind this morning, as Trump publicly thanked Saudi Arabia. The Associated Press reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump publicly thanked Saudi Arabia for plunging oil prices just a day after he was harshly criticized for deciding not to further punish the kingdom for the killing of U.S.-based columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump, who made clear in an exclamation-filled statement on Tuesday that he feels that the benefits of good relations with the kingdom outweigh the possibility its crown prince ordered the killing, tweeted on Wednesday that it\u2019s \u201cGreat!\u201d that oil prices are falling. \u201cThank you to Saudi Arabia, but let\u2019s go lower!\u201d he wrote from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he\u2019s spending Thanksgiving.\n\nThis largely echoed a point Trump included in his hopelessly bizarre written statement yesterday, in which he wrote in reference to Saudi officials, \u201cThey have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2013 so important for the world.\u201d\n\nIn a Q&A with reporters soon after, the American president added that Saudi Arabia has helped me do one thing very importantly \u2013 keep oil prices down.\u201d\n\nSo to recap, Donald Trump was told by his own intelligence professionals that Saudi Arabia murdered an American journalist and lied to him about it. Soon after, Trump decided to ignore his own country\u2019s intelligence assessment. A day later, he publicly thanked Saudi Arabia for modest gas prices.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough posture to defend. In fact, the Republican\u2019s assumption \u2013 Saudis aren\u2019t charging more for gas as some kind of favor worthy of his personal gratitude \u2013 is itself an amoral mess.\n\nSome observers have concluded over the last 24 hours that we\u2019re now coming to terms with the scope of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican First\u201d agenda: he\u2019ll overlook just about anything, including murder, if it means protecting American jobs and American consumers\u2019 interests. Principles and moral standards are nice, the argument goes, but this president will gladly sacrifice them to keep our unemployment rate and prices at the pump low.\n\nThe problem with the observation is that it\u2019s not altogether based on reality. For example, the American jobs Trump insists will result from his deals with Riyadh are a mirage. The president\u2019s claims are based on a ridiculous fiction that he continues to peddle, reality be damned.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent explained this morning, it\u2019s far too generous to argue that Trump is so committed to Americans\u2019 interests that he\u2019ll even excuse the execution of an American journalist.\n\n\u201cIn this case and many others, Trump is not being \u2018frank\u2019 about his real priorities, and he is not putting America first,\u201d Greg explained. \u201cHe\u2019s putting his own naked self-interest over what\u2019s good for America, and prioritizing the real-world policy realization of his own prejudices over any good-faith, fact-based effort to determine, by any discernible standard, what might actually be in the country\u2019s interests.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Family divided over politics talks coming together for Thanksgiving", "description": "Many Americans are saying they don't have an appetite for politics at the Thanksgiving table.

Mia Love (R) in Utah\u2019s 4th congressional district. The final margin was 0.258%, which as the Salt Lake Tribune noted, \u201cwas barely outside the 0.25 percent that would have allowed Love to request a recount.\u201d\n\n* On a related note, the Buffalo News reports that Rep.

If so, Dems may end up with a net gain of 39 or 40 for this election cycle.\n\n* If Republicans are counting on outgoing two-term Gov. Rick Snyder (R) to run against Sen. Gary Peters (D) in 2020, they should probably look elsewhere. The governor told reporters this week there\u2019s \u201cno\u201d chance he\u2019ll launch a Senate campaign.\n\n* FiveThirtyEight published an interesting analysis yesterday on voter turnout in this year\u2019s midterm elections: \u201c[T]he 2018 wave was indisputably unlike any other in recent midterm history: It came with exceptionally high turnout. Turnout is currently estimated at 116 million voters, or 49.4 percent of the voting-eligible population.

With this in mind, it\u2019s tempting to think state officials would want to invest some resources in addressing the problem.\n\nMississippi\u2019s Republican-led state government instead went in a very different direction earlier this year, approving one of the nation\u2019s harshest anti-abortion laws, which would, among other things, prohibit the termination of any pregnancy after 15 weeks. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nState policymakers knew that the law would face an immediate legal challenge, which is precisely what happened, and yesterday, a federal judge issued a predictable ruling.\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday struck down a Mississippi abortion law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks, one of the most restrictive in the United States. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled that the law \u201cunequivocally\u201d violates women\u2019s constitutional rights. \u201cThe record is clear: States may not ban abortions prior to viability,\u201d Reeves said, citing Supreme Court rulings.

Phil Bryant (R) signed the measure into law, to prevent Mississippi from enforcing the law.\n\nThe state will no doubt appeal the ruling, and it\u2019s likely Mississippi Republicans are counting on the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 which now has a very conservative five-member majority \u2013 to use this case or one like it to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nIndeed, there was some reporting from March that suggested the Mississippi law was always intended to be a vehicle for the larger conservative cause.\n\nJudge Reeves acknowledged this context in his decision, making clear he was unimpressed. \u201c[T]he real reason we are here is simple,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe state chose to pass a law it knew was unconstitutional to endorse a decades-long campaign, fueled by national interest groups, to ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n\u201cThis court follows the commands of the Supreme Court and the dictates of the United States Constitution, rather than the disingenuous calculations of the Mississippi legislature.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Watchdog groups ask feds to probe whether Whitaker violated Hatch Act", "description": "Several watchdog groups are calling on federal officials to investigate whether Acting AG Matthew Whitaker violated the Hatch Act with financial contributions he received from a conservative non-profit.

While the Trump hotel in Washington does not appear to have overtaken the traditional fundraising meccas \u2013 expensive restaurants close to Capitol Hill \u2013 it still took in $1.4 million from Republican candidates and other committees.\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s not as if all of the money from Trump\u2019s properties ends up in the president\u2019s pocket, but some of it does. It\u2019s one of the reasons the Emoluments Clause case is proceeding apace.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that, despite all of these revenue streams, the president is still losing \u201ca fortune,\u201d but there\u2019s really only one way to know for sure: he could start doing what every other modern president has done and disclose his tax returns."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "What\u2019s next for Democrats now that they have the House?", "description": "The two candidates for Mississippi\u2019s Senate seat are going head-to-head just days ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election.

I don\u2019t have money from Saudi Arabia. I have nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. I couldn\u2019t care less\u2026. Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with me.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not quite right. Consider Rachel\u2019s report from September on Trump\u2019s business relationship with the kingdom.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, before he was president but around the time he started running, Donald Trump registered eight shell companies that all included the word \u2018Jeddah\u2019 in the company name\u2026 Jeddah is the second largest city in Saudi Arabia. \u201cTrump creating eight shell companies with that city name in the company name \u2013 based on past Trump organization practices \u2013 that would seem to indicate that the president was planning to build a hotel in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. He didn\u2019t build that hotel, at least he hasn\u2019t yet. Those companies were dissolved shortly after he was elected president. \u201cBut then three days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, lobbyists working for the Saudi government went out of their way to make sure the American press reported that they were spending almost $300,000 to put up a gigantic Saudi entourage at the Trump Hotel in Washington. \u201cThe Trump Hotel in Manhattan has sort of been on hard times recently. Its revenues have declined for two straight years. But in the first few months of this year, that hotel turned its fortunes around, basically got bailed out. For the first time in years, revenue at the Trump Hotel in Manhattan increased thanks specifically to a very, very, very profligate and expensive visit from the Saudi crown prince \u2013 and his entourage too. \u201cDonald Trump has a business history and a business present with Saudi Arabia, and that\u2019s the kind of thing we never have had to factor in before when considering why president was acting a specific way toward a specific country.\u201d\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump went so far as to boast, \u201cSaudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\u201d\n\nIt was also during his candidacy that the future president boasted that he makes \u201ca lot of money\u201d to the tune of \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars selling stuff to Saudis.\n\nAs we discussed in October, this is just the stuff we\u2019re aware of.

Speaking to reporters outside the White House, \u2026 [+2708 chars]", "fulltext": "The good news is. the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council believes there\u2019s no recession in sight. The bad news is, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council is Larry Kudlow.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the White House, the former Reagan associate budget director told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m reading some of the weirdest stuff [about] how a recession is right around the corner \u2013 nonsense. My personal view? Our administration\u2019s view? Recession is so far in the distance I can\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nThe public should certainly hope that Kudlow \u2013 the top voice on economic policy in Donald Trump\u2019s White House \u2013 is correct and that the economy, which is currently healthy, stays that way. There are, however, a couple of reasons for skepticism.\n\nThe first is that Larry Kudlow, who is not an economist, has an extraordinary track record for being hopelessly wrong. Jon Chait had a great piece on this a couple of years ago, documenting Kudlow\u2019s uninterrupted track record of failed economic predictions, starting with his insistence in 1993 that Bill Clinton\u2019s agenda would \u201cdepress the economy\u2019s long-run potential to grow.\u201d A lengthy economic boom soon followed.\n\nKudlow than sang the praises of the Bush/Cheney economic agenda, denied the existence of the housing bubble, and as the Great Recession began, Kudlow assured the public, \u201cThere\u2019s no recession coming.\u201d He was equally wrong in the Obama era.\n\nIt was at this point that Donald Trump thought it\u2019d be wise to make Kudlow the top voice on economic policy in his White House, and it\u2019s from this perch that he\u2019s assuring Americans that an economic downturn \u201cis so far in the distance I can\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nFeel better?\n\nBut even if we overlook Kudlow\u2019s embarrassing predictive record, there are some other yellow lights to contend with. The New York Times reported overnight:\n\nThe stock market\u2019s struggles may seem incongruous against the backdrop of strong economic growth. But stocks often act as an early warning system, picking up subtle changes before they appear in the economic data. In recent weeks, retail stocks have been hit over concerns of rising costs, a sign that President Trump\u2019s global trade battles may be starting to take a toll and that higher wages are cutting into profits. Commodities and the companies that depend on them have been pummeled by the prospect of weaker demand should the global economy slow. Five tech giants \u2013 Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix \u2013 have shed more than $800 billion in market value since the end of August, the fallout from slowing growth and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Matt O\u2019Brien had a related piece yesterday, noting some of the reasons \u201cthere really might be a recession in 2020.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, we\u2019ve seen similar concerns more than once in recent years, and so far, the recovery that began soon after Barack Obama took office has persevered. We can obviously hope it continues.\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t take Larry Kudlow\u2019s word for it."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Trump remarks about border troops, says he'll visit war zone", "description": "The president on Tuesday said the country shouldn't feel bad for any U.S. troops at the border over Thanksgiving because they are 'tough people.'

The Republican candidate, unfamiliar with how the American system of justice operates, seemed clueless to the fact that presidents can\u2019t \u201cinstruct\u201d federal law enforcement to target their domestic political enemies. Trump, however, didn\u2019t much care.\n\nClose video Trump wanted lawyers to ask DOJ to prosecute Clinton, Comey: NYT Rachel Maddow shares reporting from the New York Times that Donald Trump wanted the Department of Justice to go after Hillary Clinton and James Comey, and that Trump\u2019s lawyers did ask the Justice Department to investigate Comey. share tweet email save Embed\n\nPresident Trump told the White House counsel in the spring that he wanted to order the Justice Department to prosecute two of his political adversaries: his 2016 challenger, Hillary Clinton, and the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, according to two people familiar with the conversation. The lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, rebuffed the president, saying that he had no authority to order a prosecution. Mr. McGahn said that while he could request an investigation, that too could prompt accusations of abuse of power. To underscore his point, Mr. McGahn had White House lawyers write a memo for Mr. Trump warning that if he asked law enforcement to investigate his rivals, he could face a range of consequences, including possible impeachment.\n\nAccording to the latest reporting from the New York Times, his indifference continued after he became president.\n\nThis reporting, which hasn\u2019t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, is extremely easy to believe. Trump has repeatedly \u2013 and in several instances, publicly \u2013 argued that federal law enforcement should serve as an extension of the White House\u2019s political agenda.\n\nIf Trump did plan to instruct the Justice Department to target his perceived enemies, it would be an outrageous abuse, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be surprising. Outrageous abuses involving federal law enforcement are a staple of this president\u2019s political diet.\n\nBut it\u2019s important not to stop reading the New York Times\u2019 article after the first few paragraphs. The piece went on to report:\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers also privately asked the Justice Department last year to investigate Mr. Comey for mishandling sensitive government information and for his role in the Clinton email investigation. Law enforcement officials declined their requests.\n\nOh? What\u2019s that? Trump didn\u2019t just want to direct the Justice Department to pursue Comey, the president\u2019s lawyers took the additional step of asking for an investigation? And federal law enforcement refused?\n\nWell, that seems like a rather important piece of information.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s probably best not to assume the ordeal is limited to the past. The Times\u2019 report went on to note that the president \u201chas continued to privately discuss the matter, including the possible appointment of a second special counsel to investigate both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Comey, according to two people who have spoken to Mr. Trump about the issue.\u201d He\u2019s also reportedly expressed his disappointment with FBI Director Christopher Wray for not pursuing the White House\u2019s political opponents.\n\nThis suggests Trump\u2019s authoritarian instincts weren\u2019t just a problem in the recent past, but rather, remain an ongoing point of concern."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Trump again sides with foreign power over US interest", "description": "President Trump said Tuesday that his administration would stand by Saudi Arabia's rulers and take no actions against them over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
