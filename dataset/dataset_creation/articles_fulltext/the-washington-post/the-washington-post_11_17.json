The sailor\u2019s role on the ship remains unclear.\n\nThe Nov. 8 incident ultimately sank the 439-foot Norwegian warship and left several people injured.\n\nNorwegian naval officers beached the vessel \u2014 the KNM Helge Ingstad \u2014 in an attempt to save it, but the frigate sank five days later after the cables holding it in place snapped. The tanker it struck, the Sola TS, was nearly twice its size at 820 feet. It suffered only minor damage.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Navy has an officer assigned to the Personnel Exchange Program (PEP) with Norway as part of the crew of the KNM Helge Ingstad,\u201d Cmdr. Kyle Raines, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy\u2019s 6th Fleet, said in a statement. \u201cThis program exchanges personnel from various military components to foreign countries to enhance interoperability with partner navies and services. The concept was born out of the need for partners and allies to share ideas and build relationships.\u201d\n\nRaines declined to identify the American officer by name, citing privacy interests. He said the U.S. Navy is supporting the Norwegian investigation.\n\nTraditionally, investigators interview all officers onboard military ships involved in collisions, so the U.S. Navy expects the American officer to be questioned as well, officials said.\n\nAnn Kristin Salbuvik, an official at the Norwegian Defense Ministry, confirmed that an American officer was onboard the ship but declined to specify the officer\u2019s duties.\n\n\u201cThe exchange program has been established to share experiences and create a basis for good cooperation between our navies,\u201d Salbuvik said. \u201cIf incidents should occur or if there are situations that involve personnel on an exchange, there is a duty, according to the valid status agreement, to inform the sending state\u2019s military authorities, as well as to ensure that relevant authorities are put in contact with relevant national authorities.\u201d\n\nSalbuvik said Norwegian authorities have notified their American counterparts but declined to elaborate.\n\nThe KNM Helge Ingstad was involved in a massive naval exercise last month \u2014 Trident Juncture 2018 \u2014 in which the U.S. Navy sent an aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, north of the Arctic Circle for the first time in decades. The exercise was widely seen as a message to Russia.\n\nThe Navy has a tradition of hosting Norwegian military personnel and embarking its own personnel on foreign vessels through exchange programs. Participants typically serve two-year tours as a fully integrated member of the host nation\u2019s navy.\n\nU.S. service members who participate in such programs are required to obey all orders from host commanders and remain subject to the American military\u2019s rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cAny individual who commits an offense against the host service code of discipline during the exchange assignment may be withdrawn from his or her assignment,\u201d according to the March 2018 order outlining the program. \u201cIf the offense committed by U.S. Navy exchange personnel against the host service code is also an offense against the [Uniform Code of Military Justice], disciplinary action may be taken against the individual by U.S. Navy authorities.\u201d\n\nThe incident comes at a sensitive time for the U.S. Navy, following two fatal collisions of guided-missile destroyers in the Pacific last year that together left 17 sailors dead.\n\nSeven sailors died off the southern coast of Japan in June 2017 when the USS Fitzgerald struck a much larger container ship, and 10 sailors died two months later when the USS John S. McCain collided with another vessel off the coast of Singapore.\n\nA Navy investigation of those disasters determined they were preventable and caused by \u201cmultiple failures\u201d among service members who were standing watch the nights of the accidents. The service has since forced some personnel who were involved into retirement and launched court-martial proceedings against others."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Valerie Strauss", "title": "Public school advocate beats charter supporter for California schools chief", "description": "It was the most expensive race for a school superintendent ever.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/11/17/public-school-advocate-beats-charter-supporter-california-schools-chief/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/y1mtN5kg0jiPJfmofYVfJnE5_d0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5NLOW5HAIII6RORQU7PNATMPVQ.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T23:08:49Z", "content": "Finally, more than a week after the vote, there is now a winner in the race for Californias superintendent of public instruction after the most expensive race in history for a state schools chief.

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nFinally, more than a week after the vote, there is now a winner in the race for California\u2019s superintendent of public instruction after the most expensive race in history for a state schools chief.\n\nState legislator Tony Thurmond, an advocate for traditional public schools, beat out charter schools supporter Marshall Tuck. He tweeted the following on Saturday:\n\nI want to thank the voters of CA for electing me to serve the 6 million students of CA. I intend to be a champion of public schools & a Superintendent for all CA students. I want to thank Marshall Tuck for his gracious call to congratulate me & wish me well. Time to get to work! \u2014 Tony Thurmond (@TonyThurmond) November 17, 2018\n\nThe election of Thurmond was a victory for forces in California who want to reform the scandal-ridden charter school sector and a blow to the charter school lobby and wealthy philanthropists, some of them out of state, who had poured millions into Tuck\u2019s campaign. Both men are Democrats.\n\nThurmond had established an insurmountable lead more than a week after the actual election, with 50.8 percent of the vote to 49.2 percent for Tuck, who lost his second consecutive bid for the job.\n\nUntil Saturday the race appeared to be too close too call, with a gap of only a few thousand votes at one point. Tuck initially led, but as more votes were counted, Thurmond took the lead and opened a wide enough margin for Tuck to concede.\n\nThurmond was elected to the California State Assembly in 2014 from the East Bay and has been a member of two school boards.\n\nTuck was the first president of the Green Dot network of charter schools in Los Angeles and then founded a nonprofit that used private donations to help turn around troubled traditional public schools. Four years ago, Tuck ran for state superintendent, losing in a race that cost some $30 million, with a lot of coming from billionaires backing Tuck.\n\nThis year\u2019s race had a price tag of more than $50 million, making it the most expensive for a state superintendent ever.\n\nThe state superintendent in California cannot independently make education policy; that is done by the California State Board of Education. But the superintendent runs the state Department of Education and sits on the governing boards of California\u2019s two public university systems and of its teachers\u2019 pension fund.\n\nThe race was the latest chapter in a long-running debate about public education in a state with severely underfunded traditional school districts. California has been called the Wild West when it comes to charters because of repeated financial and other scandals in the sector. The state has more charter schools \u2014 which are publicly funded but privately operated \u2014 and more charter students than any other state. There are about 1,275 charter schools that enroll about 630,000 students. Nearly 35 charter schools with some 25,000 students are run by five for-profit companies.\n\nThurmond said he wants to spend more money on traditional schools and stop the expansion of charters until funding and transparency issues are resolved. Tuck does not want to stop expansion, though he agreed with Thurmond that poor-performing charters should be shut and for-profits should be banned.\n\nOutgoing Gov. Jerry Brown (D), a charter school supporter, recently signed a bill into law that supposedly bans for-profit charters in the state, but it is not clear it will really do that."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Amy B Wang", "title": "Gillum concedes in Florida gubernatorial contest", "description": "Going into the recount, Nelson trailed Scott by more than 12,000 votes, and his campaign had hoped a reexamination of ballots would help him close the gap.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gillum-concedes-in-florida-gubernatorial-contest/2018/11/17/923e7701-36f7-4418-ad4b-fa154594f525_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T23:05:40Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum conceded, for the second time, to Republican Ron DeSantis in the Florida governor's race.

This was about creating the kind of change in this state that really allows the voices of everyday people to show up again in our government.\"\n\nGillum had originally conceded on election night, but he rescinded the concession in light of a machine recount for the governor\u2019s contest and the hotly contested Senate race pitting Sen. Bill Nelson (D) against Gov. Rick Scott (R). That race was still not resolved on Saturday as key counties continued counting ballots by hand after a machine recount failed to sufficiently widen the margin.\n\nThe race for state agricultural commissioner also remained unresolved Saturday.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, the machine recount ended Thursday and confirmed that DeSantis had won the race; Florida election officials had planned to certify DeSantis\u2019s victory Tuesday. But Gillum had not confirmed that he would accept the defeat until Saturday afternoon.\n\nAfter the machine recount, DeSantis said in a statement that he was focused on his transition to governor and invited Gillum to meet with him.\n\n\u201cCampaigns of ideas must give way to governing and bringing people together to secure Florida\u2019s future. With the campaign now over, that\u2019s where all of my focus will be,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nThe manual recount continued Saturday in the Senate contest in which Scott led narrowly. The machine and then manual recount was automatically triggered because the margin between Scott and Nelson was within the 0.25-percentage-point legal threshold. That recount is required to finish up by noon Sunday and has spotlighted the chaotic election system in Florida, harking back to the 2000 presidential recount there.\n\nGoing into the recount, Nelson trailed Scott by more than 12,000 votes, and his campaign had hoped a reexamination of ballots \u2014 particularly in heavily Democratic Broward County \u2014 would help him close the gap. Initial results from the manual recount did not appear to be anywhere near enough for Nelson to overcome the deficit, however.\n\nDeSantis\u2019s ascent to the governorship represents a major victory for Trump, who handpicked the congressman when he was an underdog in the GOP primary and headlined two rallies in Florida in the campaign\u2019s closing days.\n\nDeSantis aligned himself closely with the president, airing a TV ad in which he was seen reading \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d to one of his children, and as governor, he would be in a strong position to help Trump\u2019s reelection campaign in the country\u2019s biggest swing state.\n\nGillum ran on progressive policies such as Medicare-for-all and a $15 hourly minimum wage and endured what some saw as racist attacks on his candidacy. After winning the primary, DeSantis said Florida voters shouldn\u2019t \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by voting for Gillum, and Trump derided the Democrat as a \u201cthief.\u201d\n\nOne Gillum supporter called the Democrat \u201cthe way of the future.\"\n\n\"He handled this with such grace and class,\u201d said Guy Wheeler, 62, a therapist in Fort Lauderdale. \u201cHe could have stooped low, but I think even his adversaries, including the president, respect how he handled it.\u201d\n\nWheeler said the Tallahassee mayor addressed the subject of race in the contest in a manner that will help move the conversation forward.\n\n\u201cHe illuminated the underbelly, and he brought attention to what we all know is out here,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to compare him to [Barack] Obama, but he\u2019s on the forefront of the movement that\u2019s going to pull this country together.\u201d\n\nAmy Gardner, Beth Reinhard, Lori Rozsa and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nNelson\u2019s chance at win in Florida Senate race dwindles as key counties complete hand recount\n\n\u2018It\u2019s insanity!\u2019: How the \u2018Brooks Brothers Riot\u2019 killed the 2000 recount in Miami\n\nFederal judge gives Florida voters until Saturday to correct signature problems roiling close races"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Cleve R.

(Ali Mohammadi/Bloomberg News)\n\nNew U.S. sanctions on Iranian financial firms, including a bank that until recently handled most payments for Iran\u2019s imports of humanitarian goods, are having a chilling effect on foreign companies that help supply medicine and other medical products, economic analysts say.\n\nThe trade of humanitarian goods is allowed under U.S. sanctions, according to Treasury Department guidelines, permitting Iran to import food, medicine and medical devices without punishment.\n\nBut the far-reaching sanctions on Iranian financial firms reimposed two weeks ago could endanger the flow of humanitarian goods as foreign banks and outside suppliers abandon business ties with their partners in Iran, analysts and experts warn. In recent months, some European banks have refused to process payments even from Iranian firms that are exempt from sanctions out of fear of U.S. penalties, according to people familiar with the transactions.\n\nThe number of European and Iranian banks conducting such transactions has dwindled, observers say. The refusal to process payments has alarmed Iranian importers. Some say they fear transactions with outside banks could cease altogether, prompting shortages of vital goods, including medicine.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t know when other parties are going to be added or targeted. What was true yesterday may not be true this afternoon,\u201d said Alan Enslen, an international trade lawyer at Baker Donelson in Washington, explaining how companies are weighing the risks.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed a near-total embargo on the Iranian economy this month as part of a \u201cmaximum pressure campaign\u201d to force Iran to give up its ballistic missile program and curtail its support for militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah. The sanctions \u2014 which were lifted in 2016 after Iran signed a nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers \u2014 target things from oil sales to shipbuilding to multinational firms that violate the provisions.\n\nTreasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, says it has blacklisted a number of Iranian banks that met criteria, laid out in executive orders, linking the firms to terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n\nIranian bank clerks process customers\u2019 requests at a Parsian Bank in Tehran. (Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe administration last month imposed sanctions on Parsian Bank, one of Iran\u2019s most reputable private-sector institutions, for what OFAC said was support for an investment company it says is linked, through yet another company, to Iran\u2019s paramilitary Basij Resistance Force. The investment company had profited from shares it purchased in Parsian Bank, OFAC said, and those profits in turn were funneled to leaders of the Basij network.\n\nPolicy analysts and sanctions experts, however, say Parsian processed much of Iran\u2019s humanitarian trade transactions and was trusted by European firms. It was one of the few Iranian banks whose anti-money-laundering procedures were up to international standards, said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, an expert on business relations between Iran and Western countries.\n\n\u201cIt was like going after Citibank. It was that significant,\u201d said Batmanghelidj, co-founder of the Europe-Iran Forum, an annual conference promoting trade between Iran and Europe.\n\n\u201cThe way Parsian was designated suggests that other banks could also be targeted at some stage, so you suddenly have a risk,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies that know they can trade with Iran now face challenges in finding a bank, affording that bank\u2019s services and sustaining their trade knowing that at any point, that channel can be shut.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration insists that it is not targeting or prohibiting humanitarian trade with Iran and that U.S. actions are instead aimed at persuading the Iranian government to \u201cchange its behavior\u201d and return to the negotiating table for a more comprehensive deal.\n\nPresident Trump announced in May that the United States was ending its participation in the 2015 nuclear deal, which curbed Iran\u2019s atomic energy program in exchange for major sanctions relief. The administration says the agreement did not go far enough toward Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program, despite Iran\u2019s continued compliance with the deal\u2019s restrictions, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\u201cThe burden is not on the United States to identify the safe channels\u201d for humanitarian trade, Brian Hook, the State Department\u2019s special envoy for Iran, said in a briefing with reporters this month. \u201cThe burden is on the Iranian regime to create a financial system that complies with international banking standards to facilitate the provision of humanitarian goods and assistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe regime\u2019s attempts to mischaracterize these humanitarian exemptions are a pathetic effort to distract from its own corruption and mismanagement,\u201d he said at a later briefing, as the harshest U.S. sanctions went back into effect. \u201cThe regime has enough money to invest in its own people.\u201d\n\nAmong the concerns facing Iranians is whether they will be able to continue importing advanced medicine and equipment used to treat chronic illnesses.\n\nOn Twitter this past week, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif posted letters he indicated were from four European pharmaceutical companies announcing the end of their business activities in Iran. Iran has a large pharmaceutical industry of its own but imports some of the raw materials needed to produce medication.\n\nEmployees in Iran\u2019s pharmaceutical industry said in interviews that companies have already been forced to switch banks to pay for drug imports and that some have to cut back on staff and paying salaries.\n\n\u201cMany companies have started limiting their activities and laying off employees,\u201d said an Iranian employee at the local affiliate of German pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG. She added that her company faced difficulties transferring money to pay for imported drugs.\n\n\u201cWe were working with Parsian Bank, but we have not made any payments since November 4th,\u201d she said, adding that Bayer Iran planned to move its business to the much smaller Hekmat Iranian Bank. The employee spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to the media. \u201cThe problem is that foreign banks must accept the risk\u201d of working with lesser-known financial firms in Iran, she said.\n\n\n\nPedestrians look at currency exchange rate information in the window of a store in Tehran. (Ali Mohammadi/Bloomberg News)\n\nAccording to Enslen, the international trade lawyer, general licenses for food and medicine are still available under sanctions and Iranian banks that help facilitate such transactions.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government doesn\u2019t want to target humanitarian trade, but in order to achieve their objectives, which are pretty strong and bold objectives, they\u2019re not going to sacrifice their true target,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s a diabolical plot to drive out humanitarian trade. But that\u2019s not going to prevail at all costs.\u201d\n\nEven before U.S. sanctions were reimposed, inflation and a declining currency caused prices of goods such as food and medicine to rise in Iran.\n\nSarah, 30, lives in Tehran and buys prescription medication for her elderly father, who she says suffers from age-related macular degeneration, an incurable eye disease. She declined to give her full name to more candidly discuss her family\u2019s situation.\n\nHer father took PreserVision eye supplements manufactured by Bausch & Lomb in Canada, and they used to cost about $7 in Iran. Earlier this year, Sarah said, they disappeared from the market, and when she found them again, they were being sold for the equivalent of $70.\n\n\u201cAll of the prices have gone up, and we can't find many products anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes the medication can only be found on the black market, which is getting bigger and bigger every day.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nHeated rhetoric commences as Trump reimposes sanctions on Iran\n\nU.S. to allow eight countries to temporarily import Iran\u2019s oil despite sanctions\n\nUnited Nations\u2019 court rules U.S. must allow humanitarian trade with Iran\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Greg Porter", "title": "PM Update: Cold with increasing clouds tonight.

After \u2026 [+6063 chars]", "fulltext": "\n\nOn the deciding play in overtime, a two-point conversion attempt sails wide of Maryland's Jeshaun Jones. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nMatt Canada had decided on the final play well before it happened. With Maryland on the verge of a huge upset of the No. 10 Ohio State Buckeyes to achieve bowl eligibility, at the end of a breathless senior day game that featured a remarkable performance by running back Anthony McFarland, the Terrapins' interim coach wanted to play to win \u2014 not to tie, not to bring this matchup into a second overtime.\n\nCanada called going for a two-point conversion a gut decision, one he talked over with quarterback Tyrrell Pigrome before Ohio State scored on its possession to open overtime. The two discussed two possible play-calls, and Canada said they both felt good about the play the offense later attempted.\n\nBut when the chance to win came, Pigrome missed on a throw to an open Jeshaun Jones in the end zone to seal a 52-51 win for the Buckeyes at Maryland Stadium.\n\n\u201cEvery game, you want a play back here or there,\u201d Canada said after the loss. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing everybody who doesn\u2019t sit in this [team meeting] room every day, outside in the entire world, didn\u2019t give us a chance. The season was over last week. That\u2019s what everybody thought. We were done. We were written off.\u201d\n\nEarlier in overtime, Ohio State had converted on a fourth down with inches to go with a pass from quarterback Dwayne Haskins, a Maryland native who once committed to the Terps. Haskins then threw a touchdown pass to pull his team ahead for the first time all day.\n\nMaryland answered, naturally, with McFarland. The redshirt freshman carried to the 1-yard line on the Terps\u2019 first snap in overtime, giving him 298 rushing yards for the game and setting up a Tayon Fleet-Davis score on the next play. McFarland\u2019s total, on just 21 carries, was the second highest in a game in program history and came despite an apparent shoulder injury that temporarily forced him from the game in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the failed two-point attempt dropped Maryland (5-6, 3-5 Big Ten) to its third straight loss, and the team teeters on the edge of bowl eligibility heading into next week\u2019s regular season finale at Penn State.\n\nA win would have carried significance for Maryland, which has only gone to three bowl games in the past seven seasons; for Canada, who could have made a stronger case for retaining the top job; and the players, who have endured a chaotic season after the death of teammate Jordan McNair. But the Buckeyes (10-1, 7-1) \u2014 and their roster stacked with talent \u2014 barely won out.\n\nIn the first half, McFarland powered past the Buckeyes\u2019 defense, gaining massive chunks of yardage at a time. On the second play of the game, he notched an 81-yard rushing touchdown. Ohio State responded with a field goal, and the redshirt freshman ran for a 75-yard score on the first play of the subsequent drive.\n\nMcFarland\u2019s 231 rushing yards in the first half were a team record. His 153 rushing yards in the first quarter were the most in the first quarter by a player in a Football Bowl Subdivision game this season.\n\n\n\nAnthony McFarland runs away from the Ohio State defense. (Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nOhio State, which had been playing catch-up all day, tied the game at 38 with 3:41 left in the fourth quarter. But Pigrome nailed a 60-yard pass to Darryl Jones to the 1-yard line on the first play of the subsequent drive. On third down, McFarland fumbled the ball as he reached into the end zone but tight end Chigoziem Okonkwo recovered for the go-ahead score with 1:41 remaining.\n\nWith no timeouts left, Haskins led the Buckeyes down the field to tie it at 45 with 40 seconds left. Maryland still wasn\u2019t done, with Pigrome hitting Taivon Jacobs, a senior receiver, for 30 yards to the Ohio State 38. When about 10 more yards could have brought the Terps into field goal range to win in regulation, Pigrome was sacked for a loss of 14 yards. Ohio State then sacked Pigrome again on a Hail Mary attempt to send the game to overtime.\n\nPigrome, who took over the starting job after Kasim Hill suffered a torn ACL in last week\u2019s 34-32 loss at Indiana, completed 6 of 13 passes for 181 yards and a touchdown. But in a game that had just about everything, he wasn\u2019t the only Terps player who made a big play in the passing game.\n\nAfter Ohio State tied the game for the first time early in the fourth, the Terps called a fake punt on fourth down and Australian punter Wade Lees connected with Jacobs for a 15-yard gain. Not long after, Jeshaun Jones caught a 27-yard touchdown pass on third down for a 38-31 lead.\n\n\u201cOur mentality wasn\u2019t to upset Ohio State,\u201d linebacker Tre Watson said. \u201cIt was to beat Ohio State. \u2026 There was not a moment in the game today where we didn\u2019t expect that we were going to win.\u201d\n\nMaryland held a 24-17 lead at halftime thanks largely to McFarland and a key stop. With Ohio State driving to close out the first half, Maryland\u2019s Seun Oluwatimi forced a fumble and Ayinde Eley recovered in the end zone, preventing the Buckeyes from tying the score heading into the locker room. When the teams returned, Maryland\u2019s defense again delivered. On Ohio State\u2019s second snap, Haskins threw an interception that RaVon Davis returned 37 yards to the end zone.\n\nThrough most of the day, however, Haskins tore apart Maryland\u2019s defense, passing for 405 yards and three touchdowns as he completed 28 of 38 attempts. Haskins also had three rushing touchdowns. J.K. Dobbins recorded 203 yards on the ground for the Buckeyes on 37 carries. The Buckeyes finished with three turnovers but 688 total yards.\n\nThroughout the season, Ohio State\u2019s defense has struggled to prevent explosive plays, while Maryland has excelled at creating them, as exemplified by McFarland\u2019s chunk yardage. As a whole, the Terps\u2019 running game accumulated 339 yards on 48 carries.\n\nThanks to the rushing success, Pigrome hardly had to throw the ball and made several big plays when he did. But the incompletion that he will remember is the one that came in overtime.\n\n\u201cHe put us in the position to win the game,\" Canada said of Pigrome. \u201c\u2026 Being a quarterback, it\u2019s the greatest position in all of sport. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re more important than anybody else, but there\u2019s a lot to it, right? You get all the credit. You get all the blame. I know he\u2019s having a tough time right now.\u201d\n\nStill, when asked if it would be difficult for the team to come back from this loss, Canada said, \u201cIt won\u2019t be hard at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast week everybody in the country said we were done, right?\" Canada said, referring to the loss at Indiana that was considered the Terps' best shot at earning bowl eligibility. \"Said the freaking season\u2019s over. Shouldn\u2019t even play the last two. Our guys will be fine. ... I have no doubt we\u2019ll come back and play really hard next week.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\nAs Thanksgiving approaches, what am I thankful for? The American judiciary. Judges do not get the credit they deserve as guardians of our democracy. Too often we \u2014 whether liberals or conservatives \u2014 are exercised over one decision or another that did not go the way we wanted. I plead guilty myself, having once, many years ago, written a facile book berating judges for various abuses.\n\nThere are certainly examples of judicial misconduct that cry out for censure, but on the whole our judiciary is among the most effective, honest and independent in the world. That is something we take for granted. We shouldn\u2019t. It is a near-miracle when seen from a historical perspective. How many countries are there in the world where a judge could rule against a president and have his ruling so widely respected that it does not even occur to anyone that the president could disobey it?\n\nThose thoughts are prompted by Friday\u2019s ruling by federal district Judge Timothy J. Kelly in the case of CNN v. Trump. CNN (where, full disclosure, I\u2019m a global affairs analyst) had sued the president for revoking the \u201chard pass\u201d granting access to the White House grounds to its correspondent Jim Acosta. Trump had gotten furious at Acosta for posing challenging questions in a White House press conference, and this was his punishment. The White House even released a doctored videotape to suggest that Acosta had assaulted an intern who had tried to take his microphone away.\n\nBoth actions \u2014 punishing a reporter for asking tough questions and justifying that action with a lie \u2014 are hallmarks of an authoritarian regime. Trump bears a close resemblance in personality to countless dictators throughout history, from Mussolini to Putin. Like them, he construes critical news coverage as treason by \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d And if this were 1930s Italy or contemporary Russia, Acosta would not be on the job in the White House. He might not even be alive. But this is America, and we remain a nation of laws.\n\nThus Kelly issued a temporary restraining order forcing the White House to give Acosta back his hard pass. Kelly held that CNN stood a good chance of ultimately prevailing in its claim that the White House had violated Acosta\u2019s due-process rights under the Fifth Amendment. The ruling was all the more impressive given that Kelly was appointed to the bench by Trump himself after having worked for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). No one could doubt Kelly\u2019s Republican credentials, but he put his loyalty to the Constitution above his loyalty to the president.\n\nKelly\u2019s example of upholding the rule of law against the most lawless administration in our history has been widely emulated. Think of all the judges, Republican and Democratic appointees alike, who stopped the implementation of Trump\u2019s \u201cMuslim ban\u201d early in 2017. Yes, Trump\u2019s travel order was ultimately approved, 5 to 4, by a closely divided Supreme Court. The court\u2019s decision in Trump v. Hawaii was not its proudest hour, but at least the ban had been revised twice since its issuance to make its religious discrimination marginally less offensive. (North Korea and Venezuela had been added as window-dressing to the list of majority-Muslim nations targeted.)\n\nThe administration has lost many other cases that have never reached the high court. Lower-court judges, for example, have stopped Trump\u2019s attempts to end legal protections for \u201cdreamers\u201d who were brought to this country illegally when they were young. They have ended the administration\u2019s policy of family separation, forcing the release of children who had been detained apart from their families after entering the United States illegally. They have repeatedly supported special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s authority to pursue his probe of the president and his aides, most recently upholding his indictment of a Russian troll farm. They have ruled against the Justice Department\u2019s attempts to dismiss a case brought by Democrats charging Trump with violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause by accepting payments from foreign governments that book his hotel rooms. And they have struck down the administration\u2019s attempts to change federal rules to make it easier to fire federal workers.\n\nOf course, we are not in the clear yet. Further cases loom, including a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Matthew G. Whitaker\u2019s outrageous appointment as acting attorney general despite his lack of Senate confirmation. The most momentous cases of all could pit Mueller against Trump if the president challenges the special counsel\u2019s actions or tries to shut down his investigation. There is certainly cause for concern that a politicized Supreme Court may again rule for the administration, as it did in the travel ban case. But on the whole, the judiciary has acquitted itself admirably. This is how the checks and balances of the Constitution are supposed to operate.\n\nSo, thank you, to the men and women in black, for protecting our republic.

But they also avoided confronting a key question for themselves: What kind of immigration system does the party stand for in the Trump era?\n\nSome Democrats are pushing the idea of a new comprehensive immigration plan akin to bipartisan legislation that foundered five years ago. Others want to focus attention on the narrower goal of granting legal status to undocumented immigrants known as \u201cdreamers,\u201d who have lived in the country illegally since they were children and whose cause is broadly popular with the public.\n\nBut the boldest, and most controversial, Democratic rebuttal to Trump\u2019s bumper-sticker sloganeering has come from progressive newcomers, most prominently Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who swept to victory in New York behind calls to \u201cabolish ICE\u201d \u2014 the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, with 20,000 employees \u2014 over perceived abuses.\n\nSome party leaders, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), both considered potential 2020 presidential contenders, echoed that sentiment. But other prominent Democrats urged restraint, fearful of overreaching and spurring a backlash among more moderate voters, while Trump and other Republicans have seized on the idea in contending that Democrats favor \u201copen borders.\u201d Since Election Day, the progressive group has backed off the message.\n\nTrump is likely to further roil the debate with his comments Saturday that this \u201cwould be a very good time to do a shutdown\u201d of the government over the $5 billion he has demanded to fund his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nDemocrats oppose the project and are not likely to agree to further wall funding in a government spending bill that must pass by Dec. 7 or trigger a partial government shutdown.\n\nThe wall fight could further highlight Democratic divisions on immigration. Last week, at a Senate committee hearing over Trump\u2019s nomination of Ronald Vitiello as the new ICE director, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) appeared to link the tactics employed by the Ku Klux Klan to the perceptions in some immigrant communities about \u201cfear and intimidation\u201d from ICE agents.\n\nThe suggestion led to a testy exchange between Vitiello, a longtime Border Patrol official who has been the acting director of ICE since June, and Harris, another presumptive presidential aspirant from a state on the front lines of resisting Trump.\n\n\u201cI see no perception that puts ICE in the same category as the KKK,\u201d Vitiello said. Harris pressed him repeatedly on ICE\u2019s tactics, before adding: \u201cBut the perception exists, would you agree, whether or not it\u2019s correct?\u201d\n\nA Harris spokeswoman noted that the senator had, in her remarks at the hearing, praised the performance of the \u201cvast majority of the men and women\u201d in the agency. She emphasized that Harris had raised the KKK because Vitiello several years ago tweeted that Democrats were a \u201cliberalcratic\u201d and \u201cNeoKlanist\u201d party, which Vitiello said during the hearing he regretted.\n\nJohn Sandweg, acting ICE director in the Obama administration, said Harris expressed valid criticisms of Trump\u2019s rhetoric. But, he added, \u201cDemocrats need to be very careful about this \u2018abolish ICE\u2019 stuff. No one in their right mind would suggest eliminating immigration enforcement in the country.\u201d\n\nIn August, Trump held a ceremony at the White House to celebrate the \u201cheroes\u201d of ICE, during which he accused \u201ca coalition of open-border extremists\u201d of waging an \u201cunprecedented assault on our law enforcement.\u201d\n\nLiberal Democrats said Trump and Republicans have intentionally misrepresented them. They said they are not calling for dismantling enforcement but rather for ICE\u2019s duties to be redistributed across the government to help curb abuses.\n\nUnder this scenario, the government\u2019s limited enforcement resources would focus on hardened criminals, while undocumented immigrants who have lived here without committing other crimes or civil infractions could pursue legal status.\n\nIn the face of Trump\u2019s attacks, \u201cwe have to stand up and just laugh when they say those things and say it\u2019s baseless slander,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who in July co-sponsored a Democratic bill to eliminate ICE and restructure it from scratch.\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the leading candidate to become speaker in January, has said the early focus will be on a bill to offer legal status to dreamers.\n\nSuch a measure, which polling shows has widespread public support, also could contain provisions to protect immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras and elsewhere who have been living in the country under the temporary protected status program Trump has sought to end.\n\nOther top Democrats, including Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), said the party should quickly offer a comprehensive immigration bill allowing Democrats to \u201cshow what they stand for.\u201d\n\nIf Democrats advanced a sweeping bill out of the House, it would force the Republican-led Senate to try to muster a response, he added, and that could prompt both sides \u201cto negotiate something that\u2019s reasonable versus [Trump\u2019s] positions, which are just off the wall.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, a bipartisan Senate coalition approved a bill offering a path to citizenship for most of the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants, additional work visas, trims to family immigration programs and additional funding for border fencing and more Border Patrol agents. But the GOP-led House refused to vote on the legislation.\n\nIn early 2018, Trump and Democratic leaders floated a deal to provide legal status for the dreamers in exchange for up to $25 billion in funding for the border wall. The White House also wanted to speed up deportations, and significantly cut legal immigration programs. A Senate bill backed by Trump was soundly defeated with just 39 senators in favor.\n\nLeon Fresco, an immigration attorney who served as a top aide to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) during the 2013 debate, said a comprehensive deal remains a long shot as both parties retrench before 2020.\n\nIn 2016, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton moved quickly to the left of President Barack Obama on immigration, pledging to go further on using executive authority to protect immigrants from deportation. She lost to Trump, and Obama\u2019s program to protect up to 4 million immigrant parents of U.S. citizens was halted in federal court.\n\n\u201cAll Democratic candidates have to do is be slightly credible on enforcement,\u201d Fresco said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Hillary did that . . . . The message needs to be that the president\u2019s policies of ratcheting up enforcement has failed. We have more caravans, more chaos on the border.\u201d\n\nTrump has pledged to ramp up enforcement. During his nomination hearing, Vitiello refused to rule out another version of the rescinded family separation policy in which children were separated from their parents at the border, sparking a backlash for Trump. Earlier this month, the president signed a proclamation to deny Central American migrants the right to apply for asylum.\n\nDemocrats said they will fiercely oppose such measures, but acknowledged their message must go beyond standing up to Trump.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of energy on the left with respect to what people are against \u2014 as it should be because the president has done some utterly appalling things,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, who served as Obama\u2019s domestic policy adviser \u201cBut it\u2019s also important for the energy to be affirmative and present an outline for what we are for.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Paul Kane", "title": "House GOP women confront a political crisis \u2014 their party is mostly men", "description": "\u201cThis is not reflective of the American public,\u201d says New York Rep.

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nAbout a half dozen House Republican women gathered this week for a somber, post-election dinner.\n\nExchanging thoughts about the brutal results for GOP candidates, they realized something depressing, according to one attendee. That small dinner group represented about half the total number of Republican women who would serve in the House next year.\n\nJust 13 GOP women have won election so far to serve in the next Congress, down from 23 this year. With a half dozen races yet to be resolved, the House GOP \u2014 the minority party next year \u2014 is all but certain to have the lowest number of women in its ranks since 1994.\n\nThat drop-off came amid a national political climate that saw female voters sharply break from Republicans. Women favored Democrats over Republicans for Congress, 59 percent to 40 percent, according to exit polls.\n\nIt has set off a debate within the Republican Party about how to address this crisis, both in terms of appealing to female voters and recruiting and retaining women in Congress.\n\n\u201cI think the Republicans have to get off of defense on this issue,\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said Friday in an interview.\n\nCheney was the uncontested winner this week in the race for House Republican conference chairwoman, which puts her in charge of the party\u2019s communications and messaging strategy. She will become the party\u2019s highest-profile woman in Congress, trying to rebuild and rebrand its battered image.\n\nAssuming the No. 3 leadership post, Cheney will reach a level no woman has ever attained among House Republicans. (The outgoing chair, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, is No. 4 in leadership ranks while Republicans are in the majority.)\n\nRecord number of women heading to Congress\n\nCheney, who worked on Middle East policy in the State Department, brings a profile and clout among Republican women that has long been missing. But she does not see any need for course corrections on policies relating to women, arguing that Democrats create silos for female issues that treat women in a condescending way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt like it was very paternalistic to do what the Democrats do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive to women.\u201d\n\nShe said that issues like security and a strong economy cut across gender lines and that if Republicans made that argument better and had more women making the pitch, they would win more support.\n\n\u201cWe need more women running for office, no doubt,\u201d Cheney said.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) could not agree more. At a forum Tuesday for candidates running for leadership posts, Stefanik stood up and motioned to a room overwhelmingly filled with white male faces.\n\n\u201cTake a look around,\u201d she told the GOP lawmakers. \u201cThis is not reflective of the American public.\u201d\n\nStefanik said she then asked Reps. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the minority leader candidates, what their plans were to recruit and elect more women.\n\n\u201cI was struck that I really didn\u2019t get an answer,\u201d she recalled in an interview Friday.\n\nAs head of candidate recruitment the past two years, Stefanik focused on finding women to run, landing more than 100 candidates.\n\nBut many women flamed out in GOP primaries against male counterparts, and those who did break through could not swim above the Democratic wave in the general election. Just one new Republican woman, so far, will be sworn in for her first term in January.\n\nYet when Cheney and Stefanik look across the aisle next year, they will see a record number of female Democrats, at least 89.\n\nPresident Trump won two years ago despite more than a dozen women accusing him of improper conduct or sexual assault, charges he denies. After his win, the Democratic Party and liberal activists focused early on recruiting and advancing female candidates. The reaction to the #MeToo movement further encouraged Democratic women, culminating in the clash over sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and the GOP\u2019s treatment of his accusers.\n\nKavanaugh denied the allegations. Trump mocked one of his accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, at a campaign rally while Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee released an explicit statement that purported to describe the sexual preferences of another woman who had accused Kavanaugh of misconduct.\n\nCheney said those Senate confirmation hearings galvanized conservatives and did not scare away Republican women in suburban battleground districts. She said the allegations, and how Democrats handled them, demonstrated they were \u201cwilling to play games\u201d with a serious matter, and the ensuing liberal protests \u201chad the effect of really scaring people.\u201d\n\nStefanik took a more nuanced view, believing that the terrible standing with women was pretty well baked before last month\u2019s confirmation vote.\n\n\u201cWe were having problems with women voters before that,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily\u2019s List, the political committee focused on electing women supporting abortion rights, spent $14 million in the primary season and an additional $23 million on their behalf in the general election.\n\nLiz Cheney launches a new brand in Wyoming\n\nRepublicans have several groups trying to emulate that approach, but nothing remotely as powerful as Emily\u2019s List.\n\nStefanik, 34, and Cheney, 52, did not face financial hurdles in their first races. Stefanik was a domestic policy adviser in the Bush White House from 2006 through 2009 and worked on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, providing a ready-made network for her competitive 2014 campaign.\n\nStefanik has decided to back away from her recruiting role at the National Republican Congressional Committee to focus solely on helping women win GOP nominations and then get elected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m playing in primaries,\u201d she said.\n\nCheney easily defeated several veteran Wyoming Republican men in her 2016 primary, tapping her family\u2019s national network to raise more than $2 million.\n\nIn her new leadership role, Cheney sees her main focus as sharpening the party\u2019s message. She intends to do a lot more than just stand behind McCarthy, the incoming minority leader, to provide a better visual backdrop.\n\nShe wants to go after Democrats for supporting a \u201csocialist economic policy\u201d like single-payer insurance and how such a national health program would limit women\u2019s medical choices. \u201cThat would be a disaster,\u201d she said.\n\nCheney has hit what has previously been a glass ceiling for GOP women. No Republican woman, in the House or Senate, has ever moved up to party whip, leader or House speaker.\n\nIt took her father, Richard B. Cheney, who served in the House from 1979 to 1989, more than eight years to get elected conference chairman.\n\nHis daughter reached that post after just two years. She plans to be a force for a while, with the potential to break some Republican glass along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very special place,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lindseybever", "title": "Yelling 'Heil Trump!' during 'Fiddler on the Roof' seemed like a good idea while drunk, man says - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Yelling 'Heil Trump!' during 'Fiddler on the Roof' seemed like a good idea while drunk, man says Washington Post A man who caused panic at a Baltimore theater by shouting \u201cHeil Hitler!\u201d and \u201cHeil Trump!\u201d during a showing of \u201cFiddler on the Roo\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/11/17/yelling-heil-trump-during-fiddler-roof-seemed-like-good-idea-while-drunk-man-says/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yMMv5y7AQyitht-SKSzBsou-ibY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JQLPKPGFWVEKFDVHOEGJPM6TUA.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T20:31:24Z", "content": "A man who caused panic at a Baltimore theater by shouting Heil Hitler! and Heil Trump! during a showing of Fiddler on the Roof has apologized, explaining that the outburst was his ill-conceived attempt to protest President Trumps immigration policies.

At least one frightened patron had called 911, and an officer arrived at the lobby shortly before 10 p.m. to interview Derlunas.\n\n\u201cIt appeared to this officer based on my interview of Mr. Derlunas that his intention was to express his dislike of Donald Trump,\u201d the officer wrote in his report.

Rick Scott\u2019s lead over Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who conceded in a phone call to his GOP rival Sunday. But there was much more at stake in the nation\u2019s biggest presidential swing state: the rules of engagement for 2020.\n\nAmid the raucous street protests and updates from sleep-deprived election workers, influential figures in both parties \u00adinserted themselves into the drama \u2014 testing legal strategies to influence the makeup of the electorate and political arguments to win public opinion.\n\nFlorida\u2019s sprawling and diverse landscape of largely Democratic big cities, politically independent suburbs and conservative rural swaths make it a key battleground for debates over voting rights and ballot access expected to shape the next campaign.\n\n\n\nDemonstrators, including Rebecca Vedrine, center, gather Wednesday outside the Broward County supervisor of elections\u2019 headquarters. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\n[Democrat Bill Nelson concedes to Rick Scott in Florida race for Senate]\n\n\u201cThe recount was a stress test of the Florida electoral system,\u201d said Gaetz, who had just left Broward County when the call came from Brad Parscale to drive the 300 miles back. \u201cIf you were the Trump 2020 campaign, wouldn\u2019t you have concerns right now about what the terrain here will look like?\u2019\u2019\n\nCharles Lichtman, a Democratic attorney who worked on Florida\u2019s infamous 2000 recount and represented Nelson and the Florida Democratic Party this year, called last week\u2019s recount \u201cthe warm-up.\u201d\n\n\u201cStarting tomorrow, 2020 will be the most important election in our lifetime,\u201d he said.\n\nAs they slogged through the vote counts, party operatives and lawyers wielded the tactics that they are honing for the next contest.\n\nFor Democrats, who typically perform better in high-turnout elections, that meant pushing to count as many votes as possible and accusing Republicans of trying to suppress the vote. For Republicans, the goal was to limit the number of eligible votes and claim Democrats were trying to steal the election.\n\nThe tone was set by Trump, who fired off tweets after Election Day exhorting the GOP to \u201cexpose the FRAUD!\u201d and asserting without evidence that Democrats were rigging the election.\n\nIn a news conference from the governor\u2019s mansion in Tallahassee, Scott accused Democrats of \u201crampant fraud.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) invoked the Bible to make the same case, tweeting: \u201cWhat is crooked cannot be made straight, and you cannot count what is not there.\u201d\n\nDemocrats \u2014 including the party\u2019s last presidential nominee \u2014 said the GOP was trying to disenfranchise eligible voters, especially people of color.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that any elected official wouldn\u2019t call for a fair and accurate count of the votes,\u201d Clinton said in a fundraising email for Nelson one week after the election.\n\nPotential 2020 Democratic contenders such as Sens. Kamala D. Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey also weighed in, urging election officials to count every vote.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 who deployed a staffer to Florida in the homestretch of the race and gave $50,000 from her reelection campaign to Florida Democrats last month \u2014 sent out a fundraising appeal on Nelson\u2019s behalf.\n\nOn the ground in Broward County, street protesters also looked ahead to the next presidential contest. One day during the recount, a few dozen people rallied outside the elections office, many wearing black T-shirts touting \u201cThe New Florida Majority,\u201d a group that aims to increase the voting clout among minorities and immigrants. There were no Nelson campaign T-shirts in sight.\n\n\u201cFlorida has a history of voter suppression and discrimination,\u201d said Serena Perez, the group\u2019s organizing director. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried all the tricks in the book before, after and during the election, yet we\u2019re still on the verge of winning this state.\u201d\n\n[Republicans fan unfounded worries about voter fraud in Florida and other close contests]\n\nThose who came to register their objections to Democrats also appeared to have little vested in the Senate race. David Rosenthal was among those protesting Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes, who has been accused of mismanagement. \u201cIf I were going to be frank with you, I don\u2019t give a flying fig about Rick Scott,\u201d he said, wearing a Trump 2020 baseball hat.\n\nSeparate dramas played out in courthouses across the state, where campaign lawyers parried judges\u2019 rapid-fire questions in about a dozen dueling legal fights throughout the week. Republicans, Democrats and civil rights groups challenged mail-in ballots rejected for mismatched signatures and rules for inspecting ballots by hand, among other issues.\n\nThose cases \u2014 many of which will play out in the coming months \u2014 could shape whose votes will count and how they will be counted in 2020.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come all the way to Florida on a week when I\u2019ve had no sleep because my primary concern was what happens in this one election,\u201d said Myrna P\u00e9rez, a voting rights lawyer with New York University Law School\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nP\u00e9rez represented the League of Women Voters of Florida, which intervened in a lawsuit Scott filed seeking to toss Broward County ballots counted after Nov. 10, the deadline to finish the initial canvass. A judge ruled against Scott.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that a candidate will think twice before coming into a courtroom and asking a judge to stop counting ballots cast by eligible voters in a timely way because of a mistake by an election official,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe courtroom actions produced several immediate legal wins for Republicans, who blocked efforts to allow more lenient standards for counting hard-to-read ballots, extend the recount deadline and count mail-in ballots that were postmarked \u2014 rather than received \u2014 by Election Day. In the ballot-reading suit, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker said changing the rules in the middle of an election \u201cat this point would likely create a bigger problem.\u201d\n\nBut in several of those cases, final rulings are still to come, and they could force new laws for future elections.\n\nDemocrats scored a significant win in the signature-matching case, which could lead to a change in Florida\u2019s practices and challenges in other states. In that case, Walker ruled that voters must have a chance to fix mail-in ballots with mismatched or missing signatures.\n\nLiberal groups are also banking on a constitutional amendment passed in Florida this month that restores voting rights to an estimated 1.4 million Floridians with felony convictions who have completed their sentences. Those new voters could tilt elections in the closely divided state, where the past two presidential and past three gubernatorial contests \u2014 including this year\u2019s race \u2014 have been decided by roughly one percentage point.\n\nCivil rights groups plan to push for similar measures ahead of 2020 in the three other states that impose lifetime voting bans on convicted felons.\n\n\u201cWe need an intense campaign stamping out voter suppression, and it needs to start the moment these last campaigns are over,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\nRepublicans said such efforts manipulate the voting rolls for political advantage.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have not found a way to win Florida in the last few election cycles, so they decided to try to gut the state election laws,\u201d said Brad Todd, a political adviser to Scott. \u201cYou have to win with the electorate you have.\u201d\n\n[Does your vote count in Florida? It might depend on your signature.]\n\nBut Republicans, citing the need for election security, have also sought to exert control over the voting rolls, with GOP-controlled statehouses in recent years passing voter-ID laws and other restrictions that tend to sideline minorities and young people who lean Democratic.\n\nBoth political parties have used Florida as a leading laboratory to test election strategies since the 2000 presidential contest, when just 537 votes separated Republican George W. Bush from Democrat Al Gore in the state \u2014 leading to more than a month of political and legal wrangling.\n\nAfter his 2010 election, Scott began using his gubernatorial powers to influence the shape of the electorate. He announced a purge of noncitizens from voting rolls that resulted in the removal of just 85 people out of an electorate of about 12 million, according to PolitiFact Florida. Within months of taking office, he rolled back rules making it easier to restore former felons\u2019 voting rights.\n\nThat policy was repudiated on Election Day, when 64 percent of Florida voters approved the constitutional amendment granting voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences.\n\nScott and the next governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, opposed the measure, which could face more hurdles in the GOP-controlled capital.\n\nA notice appeared on a state website Thursday announcing a hold on all pending applications for voting rights restoration and suggesting a need for \u201cimplementing legislation.\u201d Civil rights advocates said they would sue if Republicans try to slow the measure.\n\nScott\u2019s office said it would defer to the incoming administration and the legislature on implementing the amendment, scheduled to go into effect in January.\n\nDuring this year\u2019s recount, even as Scott accused Nelson of voter fraud, he remained silent when the election supervisor in a conservative Panhandle county hit hard by Hurricane Michael accepted ballots by email, which state law does not allow.\n\nBut Republicans sought to leverage other claims of voting irregularities.\n\nScott\u2019s campaign distributed an excerpt of a transcript of a canvassing board meeting in Palm Beach in which an attorney for the Nelson campaign objected when a ballot was not counted because the voter was a noncitizen. The attorney later said the comment was a joke made after long hours of reviewing ballots, according to PolitiFact Florida.\n\nTrump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. misleadingly tweeted a 2012 Associated Press story headlined \u201cNearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\u201d that was published when the state released the initial, unverified list of noncitizen voters.\n\nThe state\u2019s top election official, Secretary of State Ken Detz\u00adner (R), referred only one matter for criminal investigation: allegations that state Democrats sent incorrect instructions to mail-in voters in four counties. Democratic officials said they were investigating claims that someone altered the deadline listed on follow-up affidavit forms.\n\nBut they said Republicans over\u00adhyped claims about fraud to discourage voter participation.\n\nIn a fiery speech at a century-old church in Fort Lauderdale, Democrat Andrew Gillum, whose bid to be Florida\u2019s first black governor fell short, accused Republicans of playing \u201cmind tricks\u201d to discourage voters from going to the polls.\n\n\u201cYou hear the governor of your state, the president of the United States, the junior senator of the state of Florida say that there is rampant voter fraud in the process and we need to stop the count \u2014 with no proof,\u201d said Gillum, as the mostly black crowd of hundreds of people murmured their assent. \u201cWhat do you think that does to the mind and the psyche of the person who decided to step out?\u201d\n\nIn Washington, the new Democratic majority in the House plans to counter what they call Republican attempts at voter suppression with legislation aimed at expanding voter participation and requiring voting machines to leave a paper trail for use in recounts.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we keep replaying this particular scene over and over again,\u201d said Rep. John Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who is leading a government reform task force. \u201cIt seems like Florida is always at the center of this.\u201d\n\nLori Rozsa in Riviera Beach, Fla., and Sean Sullivan in Tallahassee contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Greece: Police, anarchists mark 1973 uprising with clashes", "description": "Greek police say clashes have broken out between police and anarchists in Athens and Thessaloniki on the anniversary of a 1973 student uprising against the military regime that ruled Greece", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/greece-police-anarchists-mark-1973-uprising-with-clashes/2018/11/17/bc9f4a9a-ea9e-11e8-aff1-eec29b6f92ca_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T19:26:55Z", "content": "ATHENS, Greece Greek police say clashes have broken out between police and anarchists in Athens and Thessaloniki on the anniversary of a 1973 student uprising against the military regime that ruled Greece.

Clashes have broken out between police and anarchists in central Athens on the 45th anniversary of a student uprising against Greece\u2019s then-ruling military regime. (Yorgos Karahalis/Associated Press)\n\nATHENS, Greece \u2014 A march to the U.S. Embassy in Greece held Saturday for the anniversary of a fatally suppressed 1973 student uprising was mostly peaceful, while police officers and anarchists clashed in Athens and the next two next largest cities long after dark.\n\nAbout 6,000 extra police officers were on hand to monitor the march from the university site of the uprising, the National Technical University of Athens, to the embassy. The military dictatorship that ruled Greece at the time violently put down the uprising, and many Greeks accuse the United States of supporting the 1967-74 regime.\n\nIn the end, most of the trouble happened elsewhere.\n\nPolice said a group of about 300 agitators in the capital erected barricades and threw firebombs and rocks at officers, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades.\n\nIn Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second-largest city, officers faced off with about 200 anarchists threw an intense barrage of firebombs. At least ten people were detained. Another five people were detained in Patras after an unknown number of assailants attacked officers, police said.\n\nAbout 15,000 people participated in the march held earlier to observe the 45th anniversary of the student rebellion. The precise number of deaths in the uprising is unknown. Estimates range from 18-40.\n\nWhile the event went off relatively trouble-free, government ministers and other marchers representing Greece\u2019s ruling Syriza party had plastic bottles and coffee cups thrown at them outside the embassy.\n\nAnd in an indication of what would come later, a group that marched past the embassy attacked officers at a subway station across from Athens police headquarters, authorities said. Eight suspects were detained, police said.\n\nTwo more were detained outside the university, also known as the Polytechnic.\n\nMunicipal workers had removed the trash cans that demonstrators often use as makeshift barricades, so desks and other furniture were brought out from the university in their place. Others climbed onto rooftops inside the Polytechnic complex and threw Molotov cocktails and rocks on officers.\n\nPolice brought a water cannon to the scene, but used it to put out fires because firetrucks would not approach the area.\n\n____\n\nCostas Kantouris reported from Thessaloniki.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kantouris on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CostasKantouris\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

On Wednesday, a Montana federal judge denied Anglin\u2019s motion to dismiss the case, holding that speech in encouraging anti-Semitic harassment was not entitled to First Amendment protection.\n\nThe Montana mother found herself in Anglin\u2019s crosshairs in late 2016, after Richard Spencer, a household name in the alt-right movement, gained notoriety when a video of him shouting \u201cHail Trump!\u201d at a conference of nearly 300 white nationalists \u2014 and the Nazi salutes it elicited \u2014 went viral.\n\nSpencer\u2019s mother, Sherry Spencer, owned a ski home in the otherwise idyllic town of Whitefish, Mont. After facing local protests related to her son\u2019s views, she reached out to Gersh, who in 2016 worked as a real estate agent, about selling the property.\n\nSubsequently, court filings allege, Sherry Spencer decided not to sell. Months later, she published a blog post on Medium, accusing Gersh of extortion, threats and denouncing her son\u2019s views.\n\nThe next day, Anglin called his own readers to action.\n\n\u201cAre y\u2019all ready for an old fashioned Troll Storm?\u201d Anglin wrote in a Dec. 16, 2016, post on the Daily Stormer website. The article, titled \u201cJews Targeting Richard Spencer\u2019s Mother for Harassment and Extortion \u2014 TAKE ACTION!,\u201d was the first of 30 about Gersh on the neo-Nazi site.\n\nAnglin also relayed a set of instructions: \u201cJust make your opinions known. Tell them you are sickened by their Jew agenda.\u201d\n\nTo assist his white nationalist reader \u201cfam,\u201d Anglin doxed Gersh, her family and friends, publishing their personal contact information online, including phone numbers and email addresses.\n\nSouthern Poverty Law Center attorney J. Richard Cohen, who filed the suit on Gersh\u2019s behalf, told The Washington Post, \u201cIn the old days, maybe the Klan would burn a cross on your lawn to intimidate you. Nowadays neo-Nazis have other ways to harass and intimidate.\u201d\n\nGersh immediately began receiving hundreds of violent and hate-filled phone calls, emails, voice mails, texts and social media posts. There were death threats, and messages that threatened to drive her to the brink of suicide.\n\nAnglin and his followers even targeted Gersh\u2019s 12-year-old son. According to attorney David Dinielli, also of the SPLC, one Twitter user suggested the child look inside an oven for a free Xbox \u2014 a reference to the gas chambers used during the Holocaust in Nazi death camps. Anglin himself posted an image with Gersh and her son\u2019s face superimposed on a photograph of the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nCourt documents note that by spring 2017, the family had received more than 700 violent and threatening communications.\n\n\u201cThe trollers used every route to terrorize [Gersh],\u201d Dinielli told The Post, calling it \u201cintrusion into seclusion.\u201d \u201cShe had to erase her presence on the Internet and entirely retreat from her life.\u201d\n\nIn his court filings, Anglin argued that the First Amendment protects his posts on the Daily Stormer and that he could not be held responsible for his readers\u2019 actions.\n\nChief Judge Dana L. Christensen, of the U.S. District Court in Missoula, Mont., disagreed.\n\nChristensen\u2019s decision noted that Anglin\u2019s attack on Gersh was not to inform the public about a matter of public concern. More, the evidence seemed to show that the publisher goaded his readers, anticipating their reaction to his call to arms.\n\n\u201cAnglin did not use speech about Gersh to raise awareness for issues consonant with the alt-right agenda,\u201d Christensen said in his written opinion. Instead, Anglin drew on \u201chis readers' hatred and fear of Jews, rousing their political sympathies.\u201d He called for \u201cconfrontation\u201d and \u201caction.\u201d\n\nChristensen said, \u201cAnglin exploited the prejudices widely held among his readers to specifically target one individual.\u201d\n\nMarc Randazza, Anglin\u2019s attorney, declined to speak with The Post, though the New York Times reported that he called Christensen\u2019s decision dangerous for free speech.\n\nWednesday\u2019s decision does not end the case, which will proceed to discovery and trial phases. Gersh\u2019s lawyers still must prove that Anglin is liable for invasion of privacy, among other claims.\n\n\u201cThere is no First Amendment right to call upon hundreds of thousands of readers to launch a public attack on a private individual with the intent of ruining her life. That\u2019s simply not something that our Constitution protects,\u201d attorney Dinielli said.\n\nSuccessful litigation could offer an avenue of recourse \u2014 though a time-consuming and costly one \u2014 for victims of online harassment and trolling.\n\nHiding behind a keyboard is an insufficient mask, Dinielli said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find you and the courts will hold you accountable.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA man shouted \u2018Heil Hitler' and \u2018Heil Trump\u2019 during \u2018Fiddler on the Roof\u2019 \u2014 and people fled\n\nRepublicans attack Jewish candidates across the U.S. with an age-old caricature: Fistfuls of cash\n\nLong-forgotten Einstein letter that predicted threat of anti-Semitism reemerges with ominous message\n\nApologizing for Canada\u2019s rejection of Jews in 1939, Trudeau vows to fight anti-Semitism\n\n\u2018We were never taught\u2019: Young Jews in the U.S. encounter anti-Semitism firsthand"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "David J.

This would be a very good time to do a shutdown.\u201d\n\nThe president has asked lawmakers for $5 billion for new wall construction in fiscal 2019, but Democrats oppose the project, and a bipartisan Senate compromise earlier this year included just $1.6 billion for it.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly promised voters that Mexico would pay for the roughly 2,000-mile barrier, which carries an estimated price tag of $20 billion. But since taking office, he has acknowledged that American taxpayers will have to put up the cash.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before traveling to California to tour recent wildfire devastation, Trump predicted Democrats would stave off his shutdown threat by agreeing to wall funding.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be necessary because I think the Democrats will come to their senses.

Republican leaders persuaded the president to avoid a showdown over the wall before the midterm elections, fearing that it would alienate swing voters.\n\nIn a meeting with GOP leaders last week, the president was noncommittal about signing a spending bill that lacked full funding for his signature project, according to Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (Ala.).\n\nThe president did make frequent public comments during the midterm campaign about several migrant caravans making their way through Mexico to the U.S. southern border, warning without evidence of what he called \u201can invasion\u201d by groups including criminals and Middle Eastern terrorists.\n\nTrump also deployed more than 5,900 active-duty soldiers to the border to provide logistical support for U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who are tasked with processing migrants\u2019 asylum claims.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the deployment as a political stunt designed to impress voters before the midterms.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., speaks about the upcoming Senate runoff Friday during a rally in Vicksburg, Miss. (Courtland Wells/AP)\n\nA U.S. Senate runoff that was supposed to provide an easy Republican win has turned into an unexpectedly competitive contest, driving Republicans and Democrats to pour in resources and prompting a planned visit by President Trump to boost his party\u2019s faltering candidate.\n\nRepublican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith stumbled recently when, in praise of a supporter, she spoke of her willingness to sit in the front row of a public hanging if he invited her \u2014 words that, in the South, evoked images of lynchings. She has struggled to grapple with the fallout, baffling members of her party and causing even faithful Republicans to consider voting for her opponent, former congressman Mike Espy.\n\nThat Espy is attempting to become the state\u2019s first black senator since shortly after the Civil War made her remarks all the more glaring. It has positioned him to take advantage not only of a substantial black turnout but of a potential swell of crossover support from those put off by Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign.\n\nEspy remains the underdog in the conservative state, but Republicans with access to private polling say Hyde-Smith\u2019s lead has narrowed significantly in recent days. Republicans need only to look to next-door Alabama, where Democrat Doug Jones pulled out a surprise win last year, to stoke concern.\n\nFor Republicans, the Nov. 27 runoff is a chance for a slight expansion of their majority in the Senate, their one bright spot in this year\u2019s midterm elections. If Hyde-Smith wins and Gov. Rick Scott keeps his lead in the Senate race in Florida, Republicans would have a senate majority of 53 to 47. A loss in Mississippi would give the GOP a 52-to-48 majority, only one up from the current razor-thin margin.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign announced Saturday that he would hold rallies for Hyde-Smith in Tupelo and Biloxi the night before the election. The Republican National Committee, meantime, has two dozen staffers in Mississippi and plans to send more. The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) is also sending reinforcements and last week made a $700,000 ad buy.\n\nThe Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC has been running the first of about $500,000 in television ads, and Black Voters Matter Fund, a voter turnout group that has been working throughout the South, is sending staffers to the state.\n\nConcern over the tightness of the race came up last week during a conference call that Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo), head of the NRSC, held with Republican donors. In it, he equated the Mississippi race with the party\u2019s ongoing fight over ballots in Florida.\n\n\u201cWe take this race very, very seriously,\u201d Gardner said, according to audio obtained by The Post. \u201cWe have emptied out the building of the senatorial committee to two places: Florida and Mississippi.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith was appointed last spring to replace veteran Sen. Thad Cochran, who retired due to illness. That prompted a special election Nov. 6 and the runoff after no candidate won over 50 percent of the vote. The winner will fill the final two years of Cochran\u2019s term and have to run for a full term in 2020.\n\nEspy played down race while competing in a multicandidate field for the Nov. 6 election, even as the third-place finisher, conservative Chris McDaniel, put the second flag of the Confederate States of America on his yard signs.\n\n\n\nSen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., speaks to attendees Friday at a Gulf Coast Business Council meeting in Biloxi, Miss. (John Fitzhugh/AP)\n\nHowever, Espy has been recounting how he and his twin sister had a racial epithet slung at them almost daily in high school. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are campaigning with him. Espy also spent Saturday with Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is planning to come on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe may have all come over here on different ships, but we\u2019re all here now,\u201d Espy said after an event here last week. \u201cYes, there are race issues in Mississippi, can\u2019t sweep those under the rug. But I don\u2019t want to dwell on that. I want to be the senator of everyone, irrespective of race, irrespective of gender, irrespective of party, irrespective of religion. I want to be the vehicle of progress in Mississippi.\u201d\n\nThe race in Mississippi is another measurement of whether the South is truly in the midst of a political transformation. The past year has seen a black lieutenant governor sworn into office in Virginia, steps from where Gen. Robert E. Lee assumed command of Confederate troops in 1861, and two black Democrats ran surprisingly strong races for governor in Florida and Georgia in contests marred by racial epithets.\n\nBut while Democrats view Mississippi as the finale of an election year marked by victories in unexpected places, the hurdles here are perhaps the highest. Not only is it a state that hasn\u2019t elected a Democratic senator since 1982, Mississippi was carried by Trump by 18 points in 2016. The president also remains popular there.\n\n\u201cSome might be overly optimistic \u2014 but it can happen,\u201d said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the dean of the Mississippi congressional delegation and its only Democrat. \u201cIt would go a long ways toward saying Mississippi is changing its old segregationist ways by the election of Mike Espy. It would go a long ways toward doing away with the stereotypical notion that people in this country have about Mississippi.\u201d\n\nIn the first balloting on Nov. 6, Hyde-Smith narrowly topped the field with 41.5 percent and Espy came in second with 40.6 percent. Republican firebrand McDaniel came in third with 16.5 percent.\n\nMany top Republicans here were relieved Hyde-Smith emerged over McDaniel, who they believe would have had more limited appeal. She is a cattle farmer and former Democratic state senator who switched parties in 2010 and was twice elected statewide as Mississippi\u2019s Republican agriculture commissioner.\n\nAn abortion rights opponent backed by the NRA, she would also make history as the first woman elected to the Senate from Mississippi. She has worked to win over Trump supporters, with a campaign bus that features his image on the side.\n\n\u201cIf McDaniel had knocked her out of the runoff, this would be a knuckle-buster,\u201d said one Republican operative here, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a frank opinion. \u201cBut now it\u2019s hers to lose. I just think the wagons are circled.\u201d\n\nThe campaign is a test of both sides\u2019 ability to get voters to the polls five days after Thanksgiving. There is only one debate, taking place on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe all know her 41 percent who turned out. We know who ours are,\u201d said Joe Trippi, a Democratic consultant working for Espy. \u201cI doubt that many new people are going to be voting. It\u2019s who can motivate their folks.\u201d\n\nBlack voters make up 38 percent of the population in Mississippi, and Democratic strategists estimate Espy only needs about 30 percent of the white vote to win. On Nov. 6, an Associated Press voter survey found 57 percent of white voters supported Hyde-Smith, while 21 percent backed Espy and 18 percent voted for McDaniel. Some 83 percent of black voters supported Espy.\n\nEspy had been running a campaign like most Democrats around the country, focusing on health care and casting himself as a bipartisan broker who once endorsed Republican Haley Barbour when he was governor of Mississippi. The focus on Barbour was meant to counter Hyde-Smith\u2019s characterization of Espy as a liberal Democrat.\n\nThe release of a video Nov. 11 changed all that. In it, Hyde-Smith said of a cattle rancher, \u201cIf he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201d The national president of the NAACP immediately denounced the comments, pointing to Mississippi\u2019s history of committing more lynchings than any other state between the Civil War and the civil rights movement.\n\nHer campaign released a statement saying \u201cany attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\u201d During a news conference held with Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R), she would not answer questions, instead pointing six times to the statement before Bryant stepped to the microphone to defend her remark as merely clumsy.\n\nAnother video emerged on Thursday, released by the same Louisiana blogger who publicized the first one, in which Hyde-Smith seems to joke about voter suppression.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who maybe we don\u2019t want to vote,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe we want to make it just a little more difficult, and I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s campaign said she was joking. It is unclear whether, by \u201cthose other schools,\u201d she was referring to the state\u2019s historically black colleges and universities.\n\nHyde-Smith declined a request for an interview, and when reporters approached her last week at the U.S. Capitol, she repeatedly declined to engage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already made a statement,\u201d she said several times.\n\nWhen asked how the comments were impacting the campaign, campaign spokeswoman Melissa Scallan said, \u201cThe senator has asked us to just not comment about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus is mainly on conservative versus liberal. Mississippi is a conservative state, a very red state,\u201d Scallan added. \u201cWe do feel like we have an advantage but we are taking him very seriously. His base is strong.\u201d\n\nScrutiny has also heightened recently over Espy\u2019s past. Fox News on Thursday reported he was paid $750,000 in 2011 to lobby on behalf of an Ivory Coast despot who is now on trial at the International Criminal Court. Hyde-Smith is now running ads questioning whether he lied about that work.\n\nEspy was also forced out in 1994 as agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, amid accusations that he improperly took gifts from businesses and lobbyists. He later was acquitted on 30 corruption charges.\n\nBut it is Hyde-Smith who has commandeered most of the recent attention, to her potential detriment.\n\nAndrea Phillips, a 61-year-old family physician who is black, last week attended an Espy event at a church in Jackson. She said she is just as eager to see a woman as a black man make history. She was pleased when Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith as senator. But that changed as soon as the comments emerged.\n\n\u201cImagine Mr. Espy was addressing a group, and in an effort to appeal to them, if he said, \u2018You could invite me to a gang rape, and I would be on the front row,\u2019 \u201d Phillips said. \u201cThat\u2019s what lynching or hanging is for black people. It\u2019s that abhorrent and offensive. But she doesn\u2019t see that. She doesn\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nA half-hour away in Rankin County, one of the places where Hyde-Smith performed best earlier this month, many voters said they were not bothered by her comments. But not all of them.\n\n\u201cIt turned the whole thing upside down . . . I knew who I was going to vote for before this. Now I don\u2019t,\u201d said a man named William, a white Republican and self-described \u201cTrumpster\u201d who voted for Hyde-Smith two weeks ago. He declined to provide his last name because he didn\u2019t want to publicly disclose he was considering voting for a Democrat. \u201cMike Espy is a good guy. Nothing wrong with him.\u201d\n\nSean Sullivan and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CleveWootson", "title": "Submarine that vanished with 44 sailors found near Argentina; search for bodies and answers begins - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Submarine that vanished with 44 sailors found near Argentina; search for bodies and answers begins Washington Post As days, then weeks passed with no contact from the ARA San Juan submarine, Argentines began to accept the fact that what had on\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/17/submarine-that-vanished-with-sailors-found-near-argentina-search-bodies-answers-begins/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-GA8YEBmEiW5kvRJH0lu7dA2WCE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OCHUDNHKLUI6RL7R53BJW34SZI.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T17:56:33Z", "content": "As days, then weeks passed with no contact from the ARA San Juan submarine, Argentines began to accept the fact that what had once been an aging staple of the nations naval fleet had been suddenly and tragically transformed into a 60-foot-long metal tomb.

And, most importantly, would the craft and the bodies of the 44 sailors aboard ever be recovered?\n\nIn a bittersweet announcement Saturday, authorities said they may soon have answers to those twin mysteries. The San Juan has been found nearly 3,000 feet beneath the ocean\u2019s surface in waters off the Valdes Peninsula in Argentine Patagonia, according to the Associated Press.\n\nArgentine Defense Minister Oscar Aguad later said the government lacked the proper technology to recover the submarine, adding that officials still need to determine next steps, the AP said.\n\n[Dozens heard Amelia Earhart\u2019s final, chilling pleas for help, researchers say]\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago, the diesel-electric ARA San Juan was returning to its base south of Buenos Aires after a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern tip of South America, the Argentine Navy said.\n\nThen, suddenly, it went silent.\n\nIf trouble arose, the crew of the submarine was supposed to surface and essentially phone home, but that never happened.\n\nStill, hope lingered despite the radio silence. The submarine was full of dozens of trained and resourceful sailors. And the San Juan had multiple ways of communicating, as well as an ample supply of food and oxygen.\n\nEven if the sub couldn\u2019t communicate or surface, authorities hoped they could find it before it was too late.\n\nThe Argentine navy called in reinforcements from up and down the Western Hemisphere, an international team from the United States, Britain, Brazil and Chile and a dozen other countries combining manpower and technological know-how.\n\nBut in those initial days of the search, the news kept getting worse.\n\n\n\nFamily and friends of crew members of the Argentine submarine ARA San Juan attend a tribute on the first anniversary of its disappearance in Mar del Plata, Argentina. (Eduardo Lopez/EPA)\n\nThe search-and-rescue ships were battered by 50 mph winds and 20 foot waves, sour weather that complicated the effort to find a craft that had a finite amount of food and air.\n\nAnd authorities disclosed that just before the sub went missing, the captain reported that water had entered the engines' snorkel and short-circuited one of the sub\u2019s batteries, although he said the issue had been contained, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe German-built craft was refitted between 2008 and 2014, a complicated process in which the submarine was cut in half before the engines and batteries were replaced, the Associated Press said. But even a tiny mistake during the refit could potentially put ship and crew at risk.\n\nA short time after the captain\u2019s warning, an explosion was detected near the last known location of the submarine. The navy has said \u201ca concentration of hydrogen\u201d caused by the battery problem could be responsible for the blast.\n\nBut investigators found responsibility also lay up and down the military ladder.\n\nPresident Mauricio Macri promised a full investigation into the blast, the Associated Press reported, and appointed a federal judge to oversee the probe. Police raided naval bases as part of the investigation in January and the head of the navy was dismissed. The investigation found that navy officials allowed the submarine to go on an extended mission despite the mechanical problems.\n\nBut as military officials faced repercussions on land, the location of the sub remained a mystery, and the search continued.\n\nIn September, the Argentine government contracted the U.S. company Ocean Infinity, known for finding wrecks lost at sea. The government said it would pay the company $7.5 million if it found the location of the missing submarine, according to ABC News.\n\nThis week, the company sent out mini-submarines to the seabed and one ultimately returned with definitive photo evidence of the wreckage \u2014 on the last day of the company\u2019s mission.\n\n#ARASanJuan #LaB\u00fasquedaContin\u00faa Actualizaci\u00f3n: La empresa inform\u00f3 nuevo punto de inter\u00e9s en el Sitio 1 \u00e1rea 15A-4, a 800 mts de profundidad.

So far, more than 20 lawmakers have publicly said they submitted such letters.\n\nOne of them, Mark Francois, complained that May\u2019s draft deal would leave Britain with the worst outcome \u2014 \u201chalf in and half out\u201d of the EU. He said it would never be approved in Parliament, where May\u2019s Conservatives do not have a majority.\n\nLike Francois, many pro-Brexit Conservatives are pushing for a clean break with the EU and argue that the close trade ties between the U.K. and the EU called for in the deal would leave Britain a vassal state.\n\nAs it stands, the draft agreement sees Britain leaving the EU as planned on March 29 but remaining inside the bloc\u2019s single market and bound by its rules until the end of December 2020.\n\nIt also commits the two sides to the contentious \u201cbackstop\u201d solution, which would keep the U.K. in a customs arrangement with the EU as a guarantee the Irish border remained free of customs checkpoints.\n\nBritish media reported that several pro-Brexit senior Conservatives, including House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, were trying to persuade May to renegotiate the divorce deal in a way they find more acceptable.\n\nLeadsom told Sky News Saturday \u201cthere is still more to be done\u201d to get \u201cthe best possible deal for the U.K.\u201d before the draft withdrawal agreement is signed off on Nov. 25 in Brussels. She didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nThe deal also requires approval from Britain\u2019s Parliament before the U.K. leaves the bloc.\n\n___\n\nSee the AP\u2019s Brexit coverage at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

As he spoke, a thick haze of smoke hung in the air. Stone and brick chimneys \u2014 all that remained of some homes \u2014 were visible from Trump\u2019s motorcade.\n\nThe president also criticized forest-management decisions that he suggested are at least partly to blame for the disaster, even though the fires are considered to be more related to a record drought, high winds and a changing climate. But unlike earlier comments in which he threatened to withhold federal funding if changes weren\u2019t made, Trump provided a reassuring note. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the federal government\u201d at the ready, he promised.\n\nReferring to the staggering loss of life \u2014 76 deaths have been reported so far -- Trump sounded shaken.\n\n\u201cAs far as the lives are concerned, nobody knows quite yet. We\u2019re up to a certain number, but we have got a lot of people that aren\u2019t accounted for yet. Right now, we want to take care of the people who are so badly hurt,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown (D) walked with Trump and told reporters that the state\u2019s requests are being answered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the big, massive cleanup after a terrible tragedy,\u201d said Brown, a frequent Trump critic. \u201cThe federal government can provide some help, and a lot of money and some expertise. We\u2019ll all pull through it together.\u201d\n\nTrump toured fire-damaged areas in Northern and Southern California, making a rare visit to a state he has often demonized as a \u201csanctuary\u201d for immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\nTrump\u2019s one-day visit to the state thrust him into a role of uniter and consoler that he has never occupied comfortably. The president seemed moved by the scale of the loss around him and was solicitous of Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom (D). But he said more about the firefighters and other rescuers deployed to the fire than about the victims.\n\nAt an incident command center in Chico, Trump called the fire \u201ca monster\u201d and praised rescuers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re out there fighting, and they\u2019re fighting like hell,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s like total devastation.\u201d\n\n[Trump administration predicts rise in global temperatures]\n\nThe Camp Fire covers an area north of Sacramento that is the size of Chicago. Firefighters said Saturday that it is slightly more than 50 percent contained.\n\nAs of Saturday evening, there were 76 deaths and 9,700 homes destroyed as a result of the 149,000-acre fire, which started Nov. 8, according to the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nSheriff-Coroner Kory L. Honea said Saturday that authorities have tentatively identified 63 of the victims. The list of people unaccounted for has risen to 1,276, Honea said, and he urged people to contact the sheriff\u2019s office if they see their name.\n\nTrump said other countries, including Finland, do a better job \u201ccleaning the floor\u201d of the forest, to reduce forest fires. He said he hopes the Camp Fire will be the last one of such size and devastation because of changes to forest-management practices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have this again to this extent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHopefully, this is going to be the last of these because this was a really, really bad one.\u201d\n\nAll of California is in some stage of drought or abnormally dry conditions, with much of the burned area of Butte County in moderate drought.\n\nAs Trump drove from Paradise to a meeting with rescuers, local and law enforcement officials, supporters and a few protesters lined the road. One protester held aloft a sign reading, \u201cMoron, we are in a drought.\u201d\n\n[Republicans resist Trump\u2019s threat to cut funding over California\u2019s wildfires]\n\nBrown and Newsom flew with Trump and stood with him as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Brown responded when asked whether the fires are linked to climate change. \u201cWe\u2019ll let science determine this over a longer period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now we\u2019re collaborating on the most immediate response, and that\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nTrump jumped in a few moments later: \u201cWe have different views but maybe not as different as people think.\u201d\n\nTrump has called climate change \u201ca hoax,\u201d but has also said it is real.\n\n\u201cTrump is basically ducking the fact that climate change has to be taken in account in understanding the conditions that set the stage for the fires,\u201d said environmentalist and former State Department official Rafe Pomerance.\n\n\u201cI think what he needs to do is get his facts first, then open his mouth,\u201d said Natalie Smith, 51, who evacuated her rented Paradise home. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people up there we don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re alive, and he\u2019s worried about cleaning up our forests? We\u2019ve got thousands of people with no homes sleeping on the ground, and he\u2019s worried about us cleaning up our forests? Really?\u201d\n\nOn top of that, she said, Trump\u2019s visit to see the devastation tied up traffic Saturday. \u201cFly over it!\u201d Smith said.\n\nOf all the possessions she lost, she\u2019s most upset about never seeing her wedding ring and great-grandmother\u2019s china again. \u201cI got out with the clothes on my back and my cat in a box,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump drew wide criticism for a tweet last week blaming the wildfires on \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d of California timberlands and threatening to hold back federal funding from the Democrat-led state.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBillions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\nBrian K. Rice, president of California Professional Firefighters, called Trump\u2019s words \u201cill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the front lines.\u201d\n\nNo wildfire in California history has done more damage than the Camp Fire. It burned down the forest town of Paradise, Trump\u2019s first stop after landing at a military base north of Sacramento.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire started northwest of Los Angeles the same day and has been moving toward the Pacific Coast. It has killed at least two people and destroyed 483 structures. Among the areas threatened by the fire is Thousand Oaks, which is still grieving after 12 people were killed in the Nov. 7 mass shooting at Borderline Bar and Grill.\n\nLater in the day, the president flew south. In a Malibu neighborhood, Trump walked on paths between the lots, filled with broken glass, shattered tile and metal conduit.\n\nAfterward, out of view of reporters, he met with people affected by the Thousand Oaks shooting.\n\n\u201cWhat can you say other than it\u2019s so sad to see. These are great people. Great families, torn apart,\u201d Trump said following the meeting.\n\n[For Trump, even disaster response is colored in red and blue]\n\nSigns of the wildfires were everywhere in the region Trump toured.\n\nIn the morning, trucks carried modular homes north on the highway toward Chico. Local weather reports deemed the air quality \u201cdangerous for everyone\u201d 100 miles south of Paradise.\n\nTony Terrano, a 47-year-old welder and fabricator from Magalia, near Paradise, thought he could defend his home with a water hose. Six days later the water ran out, and he and his 3-year-old pit bull Mo Mo fled on foot.\n\nFirefighters spotted him, he said, and took him to a sheriff\u2019s command center, where he got a ride to the Red Cross shelter at the Neighborhood Church in Chico. There, a half-dozen evacuees sat outside and watched TV news coverage of Trump\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cThat fire\u2019s creating its own atmosphere, its own weather system,\u201d Terrano said. \u201cIt\u2019s like it had its own personality. There was shrapnel coming at me through my yard. It was downright apocalyptic; it really was.\u201d\n\nThe president has traveled to California, which he lost by a wide margin in the 2016 election, one other time since taking office. He visited the state in March, when he surveyed prototypes of his long-promised U.S.-Mexico border wall, addressed military personnel at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and attended a fundraiser to benefit the Republican National Committee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy he\u2019s here because we need the funding,\u201d said Allison Bazan, a 24-year-old criminal-justice student, who lost the Paradise home she and her husband had moved into three months ago. \u201cWe\u2019d like our town to be rebuilt. People need to put political points of view aside right now if they want their town rebuilt. We need to look at this from a financial standpoint more so than personal opinion.\u201d\n\nGearan reported from Washington.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the country that President Trump named when comparing its forest management practices to those in the U.S. He mentioned Finland, not Sweden."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Dan Balz", "title": "What has President Trump learned from defeat?", "description": "Some presidents have changed course after setbacks; so far Trump has been loath to admit the problems he caused his party.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-has-president-trump-learned-from-defeat/2018/11/17/8c105250-ea6e-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pz4KDBW7VzN9tSHuhHEE_kU7_U4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SQGERSHKN4I6RO63OL637HKP5U.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T16:49:06Z", "content": "All presidents suffer defeats and setbacks, whether through elections, legislative battles, international events or scandals.

Most learn from them and adapt. Will President Trump be an exception?\n\nThat\u2019s the question ahead for the president: Will the second two years of his first term be any different from the first two years? His actions and words in the days following the midterm elections indicate things actually could get worse rather than better. He has never been a gracious winner. In defeat, he has shown worse: ill-tempered, withdrawn, even more unpredictable.\n\nTrump was elected in 2016 to lead a divided country. The midterm results, however, make clear the degree to which he has widened those divisions. He has driven suburban voters, especially college-educated women, away from the Republican Party. His hold on rural America remains strong, but the midterms suggest possible slippage.\n\nHe was elected to lead a world in transition and under stress. He has added to that stress by weakening traditional alliances and embracing authoritarian leaders, while offering no clear strategy for key areas of the world. He has sought to dismantle or redraw global trade deals and other arrangements that his predecessors helped to construct.\n\n'Close to complete victory'\n\nIt may be premature to draw a conclusion about what lessons he has learned, but rather than moving to mitigate the damage done to his party in the midterms or to assert international leadership, Trump has done the opposite in the days since the elections. He has reinforced what his presidency has wrought, domestically and internationally, and left others to worry about what comes next.\n\nAt home, Trump claimed that the midterms were \u201cclose to complete victory\u201d for his party and especially for himself. It was an extravagant assertion at the time he made it \u2014 the day after the elections \u2014 and even more so today. Other presidents have accepted some responsibility for the losses of their party in midterm elections, or at least acknowledged the reality of defeat. Trump is having none of that.\n\nYet the scope of the Nov. 6 defeat is now undeniable. The president is correct that Republicans gained ground in the Senate, reinforcing their narrow majority, but equally incorrect is his saying the media haven\u2019t highlighted those gains. The media also have noted that Republicans enjoyed the most favorable Senate election map in generations.\n\nRepublicans defeated three red-state Democratic senators. GOP candidates also won or are leading in four high-profile statewide races \u2014 gubernatorial elections in Florida and Georgia and Senate races in Florida and in Texas. But the party surrendered GOP-held Senate seats in Nevada and Arizona and lost senatorial or gubernatorial contests in three presidential battlegrounds in the Midwest.\n\n[Five days of fury: What happened in the days after the election?]\n\nThe House results produced a string of defeats that have left the GOP weaker in key parts of the country, states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, for example. In New England, other than Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Republicans will have no congressional representation. In California, Orange (as in County) is the new blue, after several victories by Democrats in competitive House districts in a county that once was the symbolic and real heartland of American conservatism.\n\nJubilant Democrats will face a reckoning two years from now, however, when their newly minted House members stand for reelection. Many of the winners (in both parties, actually) carried their districts with slender margins. The 2020 elections will test the resilience of these new members, whose races will enjoy less prominence and potentially less money than they had this year, given the overriding attention the presidential race will receive.\n\nBut this year\u2019s elections laid a foundation, thanks in large part to voters\u2019 negative reactions to the president. Young voters supported Democrats by margins well beyond those rung up even by Barack Obama in his two presidential campaigns. Voters under age 30 supported Democrats by 44 points, according to a post-election analysis by the Democratic firm Catalist.\n\nThe suburban defeats are potentially the most damaging to the GOP, if Trump or other GOP leaders do not act to reverse them. Orange County is one example but not the only suburban area that produced gains for Democrats. DuPage County, outside Chicago, has been a Republican stronghold for years, though the GOP\u2019s grip had been weakening. Now, not a single House member in the new Congress whose district includes a part of DuPage County will be a Republican.\n\nSuburban voters in red states also showed increased support for Democratic candidates, whether it was Texas or Georgia, Utah or Oklahoma.\n\n[Trump wonders why no one talks much about this part of the midterms]\n\nRepublicans now hold a strong base in rural America. But in this election, their margins were not as big as Trump rolled up in 2016. The president\u2019s advisers argue, fairly, that people should be cautious about projecting forward as to how those rural areas will vote in 2020, when Trump\u2019s name is again on the ballot. But if the suburbs are trending away, he will need all the rural ground he had in 2016 and perhaps more.\n\nOff to Paris\n\nInternationally, the president\u2019s trip to Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the armistice of World War I brought a reminder of the degree to which he has chosen to stand apart from traditional U.S. allies. He was absent physically at key moments, and absent intellectually in providing the leadership that long has come with being the American president.\n\nThe armistice of World War I is an event marked yearly with ceremonies throughout Europe, in small towns and the great capitals. The centenary was meant to be the biggest such commemoration in decades. Yet Trump did not go, as scheduled, to pay respects at an American cemetery outside Paris, where more than 2,000 American troops are buried. Weather was blamed for the decision, but he later vented at his staff for making him look bad.\n\nThe next day he chose not to march in the rain with other global leaders on the Champs-Elysees, choosing instead to be driven to the Arc de Triomphe for the later ceremony. Another leader who skipped the solidarity march was Russian President Vladimir Putin. Later, Trump engaged in a Twitter spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, after Macron in his ceremony speech sharply rebuked the concept of nationalism that Trump has embraced.\n\nNicholas Burns, the former U.S. ambassador to NATO who served Republican and Democratic presidents as a career diplomat, said of the trip, \u201cIt was one of the most ineffective presidential trips I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nAfter returning to the United States last Sunday night, Trump chose not to make the traditional presidential trip to Arlington Cemetery the following morning to observe Veterans Day. Later in the week, apparently seeking to make amends, he went to the Marine Barracks in Washington for a lunchtime visit. On Friday, he acknowledged he had made a mistake by not going to Arlington Cemetery. He said he was busy making \u201ccalls for the country.\u201d\n\nSince returning from Paris, Trump has embraced bipartisan legislation on criminal justice restructuring. Is that a sign of the future or a one-off by the president? At home and abroad, he is being closely watched for signs of how the election defeats have affected him. He has plodded through the days after the election, seeming mostly unhappy in what was \u201cclose to compete victory.\u201d He now must know what was lost in the midterms, but he seems lost in knowing how to respond."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "US military chief says tech giants should work with Pentagon", "description": "The top U.S. military officer says it's problematic that American tech companies don't want to work with the Pentagon but are willing to engage with the Chinese market", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/us-military-chief-says-tech-giants-should-work-with-pentagon/2018/11/17/4c219964-ea88-11e8-aff1-eec29b6f92ca_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T16:46:15Z", "content": "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia The top U.S. military officer says its problematic that American tech companies dont want to work with the Pentagon but are willing to engage with the Chinese market.

(Peter Barreras/Invision/AP)\n\nStudents at a New York high school have protested in recent weeks an online education program developed with engineers working for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in the latest challenge to the growing \u201cpersonalized learning\u201d movement in U.S. education.\n\nMore than 100 students from Brooklyn\u2019s Secondary School for Journalism left campus during school hours last week and this week. Protest leaders sent a letter to Zuckerberg questioning his support for the Summit Learning Platform, which is being used in some 380 schools in a number of states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe students said they weren\u2019t learning on the platform and are concerned about the privacy of personal information collected on it. Their demonstration was the latest in a number of states, including one in a Connecticut school district, where officials ended their collaboration with Summit.\n\nThe free platform, which offers online lessons and assessments, was developed by a network of 11 charter schools in California and Washington known collectively as Summit Public Schools, and Facebook engineers helped develop the software. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, back the learning platform with engineering support through their for-profit Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The Summit website says the platform is a \u201cpersonalized, research-backed approach\u201d to teaching and learning.\n\n\u201cPersonalized learning\u201d \u2014 one of the reform models being promoted by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, philanthropists and businesses \u2014 is the latest form of what used to be known as \u201cdifferentiated learning,\u201d or, simply, learning specific to the student. Today, online programs allow students to move at their own pace.\n\nThough there is no consensus definition of \u201cpersonalized learning,\u201d and though it seems to make intuitive sense to enable students to move at their own pace, in practice, this has amounted to computer-based learning programs of varying quality that require kids to sit in front of screens for a good part of the school day.\n\nKelly Hernandez, 17, a senior at the Secondary School for Journalism, said she helped organize the protest because students felt their complaints about Summit were not being heard. She said students began using it at the beginning of the school year without background information.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t asked for an opinion about whether we would want to do Summit Learning,\u201d she said. \u201c \u2018Just use the computer. Here\u2019s your name and password. Enjoy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAkila Robinson, 17, another protest leader at the school, said she had problems logging on to Summit for two months and couldn\u2019t get help. Another student, she said, had the same sign-on information.\n\nSchool officials declined to comment on the protest or issues with Summit.\n\nAfter the protest, school officials told students the program would no longer be used for juniors and seniors, but that ninth- and 10th-graders would continue using it.\n\nHernandez and Robinson sent a letter to Zuckerberg, which says in part (see the letter in full below):\n\nUnfortunately we didn\u2019t have a good experience using the program, which requires hours of classroom time sitting in front of computers. Not all students would receive computers, the assignments are boring, and it\u2019s too easy to pass and even cheat on the assessments. Students feel as if they are not learning anything and that the program isn\u2019t preparing them for the Regents exams they need to pass to graduate. Most importantly, the entire program eliminates much of the human interaction, teacher support, and discussion and debate with our peers that we need in order to improve our critical thinking. Unlike the claims made in your promotional materials, we students find that we are learning very little to nothing. It\u2019s severely damaged our education, and that\u2019s why we walked out in protest. . . . Another issue that raises flags to us is all our personal information the Summit program collects without our knowledge or consent. We were never informed about this by Summit or anyone at our school, but recently learned that Summit is collecting our names, student ID numbers, email addresses, our attendance, disability, suspension and expulsion records, our race, gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status, our date of birth, teacher observations of our behavior, our grade promotion or retention status, our test scores and grades, our college admissions, our homework, and our extracurricular activities. Summit also says on its website that they plan to track us after graduation through college and beyond. Summit collects too much of our personal information, and discloses this to 19 other corporations. What gives you this right, and why weren\u2019t we asked about this before you and Summit invaded our privacy in this way?\n\nRaymonde Charles, communications director for education at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, said in an email:\n\nWe were very concerned to learn about the experience of students at the Secondary School of Journalism. The conditions described are unacceptable -- and not reflective of Summit Learning\u2019s high standards that have led nearly 70 percent of Summit teachers to recommend the program to their peers and year on year 90 percent of schools stay in the Program. We understand that there were issues in terms of the implementation of the required elements of the Summit program, including participation in teacher training and infrastructure needs. The Summit team is on the ground meeting with the administration to see if they can help address these issues.\n\nCharles also said the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative \u201cpartners with Summit Public Schools to help build tools that allow teachers to customize instruction to meet students' individual needs and interests.\u201d She also said, \u201cCZI is an independent philanthropic organization that is entirely separate from Facebook. We don\u2019t own or sell student data \u2014 and have no intention to \u2014 and adhere to the Student Privacy Pledge.\u201d\n\nThe pledge is a joint venture of the Future of Privacy Forum and the Software & Information Industry Association, and it asks organizations to promise to \u201csafeguard student privacy regarding the collection, maintenance, and use of student personal information.\u201d\n\nLeonie Haimson, an advocate for public schools in New York, has been monitoring Summit for two years and said parents in 15 states have reached out to her with complaints. Haimson, co-chair of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, successfully led the battle to stop nine states from disclosing personal student data to a student database project called inBloom.\n\nShe wrote on the NYC Public School Parents blog:\n\nParents have rebelled against Summit Learning in Boone County, in Kentucky; Fairview Park City School District in Ohio; Indiana Area School District in Pennsylvania; Clearwater County in Idaho; McPherson in Kansas and elsewhere. Because of growing parent and student discontent, some districts have completely eliminated the use of the Summit platform, including in Cheshire, Connecticut; several others have rolled back the implementation of the program or made it optional for students and parents, including in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nLast year, for example, the Cheshire Public Schools district in Connecticut ended use of the Summit platform after parents' complaints about some of the content and other issues, Superintendent Jeffrey F. Solan said in a 2017 letter to the community. An EdSurge story quoted a parent, Michael Ulicki, as saying he had seen no long-term data that the platform was successful in teaching students and that he worried the program was \u201can experiment on our children.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the full letter from the students to Zuckerberg:"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Iraq's president visits Iran weeks after US renews sanctions - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Iraq's president visits Iran weeks after US renews sanctions Washington Post TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Iraq's President Barham Salih began a visit to Iran on Saturday, where he pledged to improve relations less than two weeks after the United States rest\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/iraqs-president-visits-iran-weeks-after-us-renews-sanctions/2018/11/17/99d017a0-ea81-11e8-aff1-eec29b6f92ca_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T15:59:27Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "In this photo released by official website of the Office of the Iranian Presidency, Iraqi President Barham Salih, right, and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani shake hands during an official welcome ceremony for Salih at the Saadabad Palace in Tehran, Iran, Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018. Salih is visiting Iran less than two weeks after the United States restored oil sanctions that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. (Iranian Presidency Office via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nTEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Iraq\u2019s President Barham Salih began a visit to Iran on Saturday, where he pledged to improve relations less than two weeks after the United States restored oil sanctions that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nIran, which has had major influence over Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, is hoping to maintain exports to its neighbor despite the renewed sanctions. Iraq is Iran\u2019s second-largest market after China, buying everything from food and machinery to electricity and natural gas.\n\nAt a joint briefing after their meeting, Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani said they discussed increasing trade in electricity and oil products and the establishment of free trade zones along the border. He said they also discussed joint oil projects and improving transport links between the two countries.\n\nTrade between the two countries was some $7 billion in 2017, and they have vowed to boost it to $8.5 billion this year. Rouhani said it could eventually reach $20 billion a year.\n\nSalih also pledged to improve ties, and suggested the formation of a \u201cnew regional system\u201d including Iraq and Iran, one based on \u201cpolitical integrity, national interests and cooperation between nations and governments.\u201d He did not elaborate.\n\nLater in the day, Salih met Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who urged for unity among the two countries and said Iraqis should resist foreign intervention.\n\n\u201cSome governments in the region and beyond the region have a strong grudge toward Islam, Shiite and Sunni, and interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq,\u201d said Khamenei. \u201cThe impudent and clear enemy must be strongly resisted.\u201d He did not name any country.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in May. United Nations monitors say Iran still abides by the deal, in which it agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nSince then, Trump announced what he billed as the \u201ctoughest ever\u201d sanctions against Iran, and the country has seen its oil exports plunge and its currency lose more than half its value. The full brunt of the measures came into effect Nov. 5 when the U.S. re-imposed oil and banking sanctions.\n\nThe U.S., which provided crucial military support to Iraq in its battle against the Islamic State group, has granted Iraq a 45-day waiver to allow it to continue to purchase gas and electricity from Iran.\n\nSalih said Iraq should not be \u201ca field for struggle between conflicting demands and wills.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He has also looked for ways to avoid pinning the blame on Mohammed, the aides said.\n\nTrump spoke with Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during his flight to California to tour areas damaged by the wildfires there, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nWhile touring fire damage in Malibu, Trump confirmed that he had spoken with Haspel. Asked about reports that the CIA had assessed involvement by Mohammed, the president said: \u201cThey haven\u2019t assessed anything yet. It\u2019s too early.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing that took place, the killing of a journalist,\u201d he said, adding that there would be a \u201ca report on Tuesday\u201d that will address what \u201cwe think the overall impact was and who caused it, and who did it.\u201d\n\n[CIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s assassination]\n\nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert issued a statement Saturday that did not directly address the CIA\u2019s findings about Mohammed or mention him.\n\n\u201cRecent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate,\u201d she said. \u201cThere remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. The State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts. In the meantime, we will continue to consult Congress, and work with other nations to hold accountable those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nThe Post and other media outlets have reported on the CIA\u2019s assessment but have not said the U.S. government reached a conclusion about what happened to Khashoggi.\n\nThe president\u2019s skepticism has put him at odds with the findings of the CIA and senior intelligence officials.\n\nHaspel and John Bolton, the national security adviser, have briefed Trump on the intelligence community\u2019s findings, with Haspel offering pieces of evidence that show lieutenants of Mohammed were directly involved in the killing, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n[Saudi Arabia distances crown prince from killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi]\n\nIn conversations with his intelligence and national security advisers, the president has seized on the question of whether evidence shows that Mohammed \u201cordered\u201d Khashoggi\u2019s death, asserting that his advisers haven\u2019t offered him definitive proof. He has also asked CIA and State Department officials where Khashoggi\u2019s body is and has grown frustrated that the journalist\u2019s remains haven\u2019t been found.\n\nKhashoggi was a contributor to The Post\u2019s Global Opinions section.\n\nReferring to the crown prince, Trump told reporters Saturday, \u201cAs of this moment, we were told that he did not play a role; we\u2019re going to have to find out what they say.\u201d\n\nThe president didn\u2019t specify who had said Mohammed had played no role.\n\nThe CIA did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut within the White House, there has been little doubt that Mohammed was behind the killing.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where everyone basically knows what happened,\u201d said one adviser who talks to Trump often. This person said Trump has repeatedly criticized how Mohammed has handled the situation and has said it is clear they are hiding facts.\n\nThe Saudis have offered contradictory explanations for what happened to Khashoggi after he stepped inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage.\n\nOnce inside, Khashoggi was set upon by a team of Saudi agents who had flown to Istanbul to kill him, according to intelligence assessments by the United States and European governments. The team is thought to have dismembered Khashoggi and disposed of his remains.\n\nThe CIA analyzed audio recordings from inside the consulate, which were provided by the Turkish government, as well as intercepted phone calls, according to people familiar with the matter. One of those calls was placed by a member of the hit team from inside the consulate to a senior aide to Mohammed, informing him that the killing had taken place, according to people familiar with the call.\n\nThe Saudi government has insisted that the prince knew nothing of the operation, which it has blamed on rogue actors who went beyond their authority in a mission meant to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi had written critically of Mohammed\u2019s policies and was living in a self-imposed exile in Virginia out of concern for his safety in his native country.\n\n\u201cThe claims in this purported assessment are false,\u201d Fatimah Baeshen, a spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, said of the CIA findings. \u201cWe have and continue to hear various theories without seeing the primary basis for these speculations.\u201d\n\nFor more than a month, Trump has struggled to balance his interest in maintaining strong relations with the Saudi government with growing pressure in Congress and around the world to punish the Saudi regime. Trump has told aides that he wants Mohammed to stay in power and that he sees the Saudis as the best strategic check on Iran and as a vital source of oil. Mohammed has a close relationship with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser who helps lead the administration\u2019s Middle East strategy.\n\nThis past week, the Saudi public prosecutor acknowledged that a team of Saudi agents had killed Khashoggi, but he claimed that they had been sent only to bring him back to Saudi Arabia. The prosecutor has brought charges against 11 people he characterized as part of a rogue operation, and he said he would seek the death penalty for five of those involved.\n\nThe Treasury Department also announced that it would freeze the assets of 17 Saudi individuals and prohibit companies from doing business with them.\n\nOn Friday evening, Kirsten Fontenrose, the National Security Council official in charge of U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia, resigned, administration officials said. The circumstances of her departure weren\u2019t clear. But Fontenrose had previously been placed on administrative leave, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nFontenrose had played a key role in the administration\u2019s decision about which Saudis to sanction in response to Khashoggi\u2019s killing, these people said.\n\nFontenrose\u2019s departure was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nTrump has accused the Saudi government of trying to cover up its role. But he has looked for ways to avoid blaming Mohammed, aides and advisers said. He has thought about scenarios in which Mohammed would not have known what his underlings were doing, one adviser said.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that this took place without his knowledge,\u201d Trump said in an interview last month with The Post. \u201cAnd now they are trying to clean up a mess.\u201d\n\nThat also contradicts the CIA\u2019s findings. The agency determined that because Mohammed exercises absolute authority in the kingdom, it was inconceivable that an operation of such scale \u2014 involving 15 agents traveling internationally on government aircraft \u2014 could have been completed without the prince\u2019s knowledge and authorization, according to people who are familiar with the agency\u2019s conclusions.\n\nMoreover, several members of the hit team can be tied directly to Mohammed. Some worked on his security detail, and others have traveled in the United States at the same time as the prince or other senior Saudi officials, passport records and other public information show.\n\nTrump has made clear to European allies that he is uninterested in a joint response to the killing, even as pressure mounts to hold the Saudi regime accountable, according to a diplomat briefed on the calls.\n\nThe adviser who talks to Trump said: \u201cIf the president had his way, he would stay entirely out of the Middle East and all of the problems. This is a problem that he wants to go away.\u201d\n\nJohn Hudson, Anne Gearan and Missy Ryan contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump again offers GOP votes to make Pelosi speaker.

Sometimes, people don\u2019t.\n\nIn the last installment, three University of Maryland football players were the best teachers for taking a stand on an important issue when adult leaders of the university failed to do so. Before that, Democratic Rep. John Lewis, who represents Georgia\u2019s 5th Congressional District, was the best teacher of the week for his relentless efforts to expand civil rights and persuade people to vote. Last month, Sen.

The soldiers were among several thousand active-duty forces deployed to the border by Trump in what the president said was a necessary move to protect the country against a caravan of migrants. Critics branded it a pre-election political stunt.\n\nMattis went to visit the troops Wednesday. On the flight down, according to this Washington Post story, the secretary described the deployment as a \u201cmoral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen.\u201d He told the troops they should ignore the controversy over their deployment, saying:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of stuff in the news, and that sort of thing. You just concentrate on what your company commander, your battalion commander, tells you. Because if you read all that stuff, you know, you\u2019ll go nuts.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop one soldier from questioning Mattis about exactly what the troops were doing there. Since they arrived, they have largely been charged with putting up wire as a border barrier.\n\n\u201cWhat are the short- and the long-term plans of this operation, sir?\u201d one asked Mattis.

Longer-term, it\u2019s somewhat to be determined.\u201d\n\nAnother soldier raised his voice: \u201cSir, I have a question. The wire obstacles that we\u2019ve implanted along the border. \u2026 Are we going to be taking those out when we leave?\"\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed News, that question prompted some \u201csnickers\u201d among other troops. Mattis said the mission was to put in the wire for now, and if that changed, the soldiers would be told later.\n\nAsking the defense secretary pointed questions about exactly what they are doing on the border when the mission seems so murky took courage. These soldiers were not cowed and chose to try to get information so they could make sense of what they are being asked to do. They weren\u2019t refusing to do it, but were just trying to get clarification. That\u2019s always a good lesson, so that\u2019s why they\u2019re the teachers of the week."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "\u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0643\u0632\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062c \u0623\u0646\u0651 \u0648\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a \u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u063a\u062a\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u062e\u0627\u0634\u0642\u062c\u064a", "description": "Audio recordings, intercepted phone calls and other intelligence link Mohammed bin Salman to killing that Saudis say was conducted by rogue elements.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2018/11/17/arabic-version-cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZvV7xSwuXYyBwBOCklm-IvRLeow=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I4TI2YOHDU4UJAA4QFVBL4AXR4.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:38:49Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Congo rebels attack, burn homes near UN base in east", "description": "Congo's army spokesman says rebels have burned homes and a car in a neighborhood in the country's east where U.N. peacekeeping forces have a base", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/congo-rebels-attack-burn-homes-near-un-base-in-east/2018/11/17/6e6947b4-ea75-11e8-aff1-eec29b6f92ca_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:31:12Z", "content": "BENI, Congo Congos army spokesman says rebels have burned homes and a car in a neighborhood in the east of the country where U.N. peacekeeping forces have a base.

The ministry said a network of drivers blocked roads at some 2,000 locations across the country, generating backups for miles and causing one death.\n\nA 63-year-old protester was killed in the eastern Savoie region when a driver panicked by demonstrators accidentally accelerated a vehicle into the crowd, French media reported. In other incidents nationwide, 106 people were reported injured, five seriously.\n\nThe protesters\u2019 chief complaint: the rising cost of diesel fuel. The recent price hike is a direct result of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s commitment to curbing climate change, which included higher carbon taxes for 2018, the first full year of his term. But beyond the diesel issue, many turned out Saturday to voice any number of other frustrations with the \u201cpresident for the rich,\u201d who is seen as increasingly removed from ordinary people\u2019s concerns.\n\nDiesel, a fossil fuel, is known for the pollutants it emits into the air. Although it was traditionally taxed at the same rate as gasoline, that is no longer the case: Taxes on diesel have risen 6.2 percent per liter this year, as part of the government\u2019s efforts to protect clean air. The problem is, diesel remains the most common fuel in France, leading many to view recent policies as an attack on working people more than an environmental safeguard.\n\nThe stirrings of the \u201cyellow vest\u201d campaign behind Saturday\u2019s protests began this summer, with online petitions urging Macron to reconsider. But the loudest voice was that of Jacline Mouraud, a white-haired hypnotist and grandmother of three from Brittany who has become the star of the movement.\n\n\u201cI have two little words for Mr. Macron and his government,\u201d she said in a YouTube video that has garnered millions of views. \u201cYou have persecuted drivers since the day you took office. This will continue for how long?\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Mouraud was asked to explain the death of the protester. \u201cI deplore the death of this woman,\u201d she said, speaking to Europe 1 radio. \u201cBut who is responsible for this situation? The French government is responsible for the death of this woman.\u201d\n\nHer view of the government is not a fringe opinion. According to a poll published Friday by the Odoxa agency for France\u2019s Le Figaro newspaper \u2014 albeit with only 1,000 respondents \u2014 as many as 3 in 4 French people agree. Whatever the actual figure, Macron\u2019s opponents, particularly on France\u2019s political extremes, have sought to capitalize on the sentiment, using the yellow-vest movement to cast the president as an out-of-touch elitist.\n\nThat is a common criticism of Macron, whose approval ratings have recently plummeted to as low as 26 percent. Even President Trump noted Macron\u2019s low popularity in a flurry of tweets after a tense visit to Paris last week.\n\n[In a morning tweetstorm, Trump takes repeated aim at France\u2019s Macron]\n\nLaurent Wauquiez, the leader of France\u2019s right-wing Les R\u00e9publicains, announced he would demonstrate Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re offered a punitive environmental policy that involves massive increases in taxes,\u201d Wauquiez said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the fact that in this country, environmental policy always comes by way of taxes.\u201d\n\nIn response, Macron has offered his \u201crespect and consideration\u201d to the protesters but has refused to budge. He is also far from alone in advocating higher carbon taxes.\n\nThe United Nations contends taxing carbon dioxide emissions is an essential component of halting a steady rise in global temperatures. It was a key element of the world body\u2019s major October report predicting Earth\u2019s atmosphere may warm by up to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit over preindustrial levels as soon as 2040, potentially triggering a global crisis decades earlier than expected.\n\nApproximately 48,000 people die in France each year from pollution-related causes, according to France\u2019s public health watchdog.\n\nSince his election, Macron has sought to position himself as a leading voice for action on climate change \u2014 in notable contrast to Trump. When Trump withdrew the United States from the landmark Paris climate accord of 2015, Macron invited U.S. climate scientists to continue their research in France. In English, he even played on Trump\u2019s campaign slogan: \u201cMake Our Planet Great Again.\u201d\n\nDespite those public interventions, however, the French president has come under fire at home for not making much progress on the climate question. The criticism has come even from within his own cabinet: Nicolas Hulot, a former television personality who served as Macron\u2019s staggeringly popular environment minister, resigned during an August radio interview that took the Elysee Palace by surprise.\n\nAs Hulot said during the interview: \u201cHave we begun to reduce the use of pesticides? The answer is no. Have we started to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? The answer is no. Or to stop the erosion of biodiversity? No.\u201d\n\n[France\u2019s Macron reshuffles his cabinet in effort to quell political instability]\n\nStill, carbon taxes have been a priority for Macron since the beginning, with France raising its carbon tax from $35 a ton in 2017 to $51 a ton in 2018. The cost is slated to keep rising, eventually reaching $98.50 a ton in 2022.\n\nIn recent weeks, the government has acknowledged the impact on the average French pocketbook. But since early 2018, consumers have been eligible for an \u201cenvironmental bonus\u201d rebate: Trade in a diesel car for a more environmentally friendly model, and get money back.\n\nAlthough the government is sticking to its policies, Macron, in a rare concession, appears to recognize the blow to his image that the demonstrations represent.\n\nAs he recently said: \u201cI have not succeeded in reconciling the French people with their leaders.\u201d\n\nQuentin Ari\u00e8s contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nFrance\u2019s Macron takes lead in climate change battle, with the U.S. absent\n\nPromising to \u2018Make Our Planet Great Again,\u2019 Macron lures 13 U.S. climate scientists to France\n\nToday's coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Thai officials recover boat that sank, killing 47 Chinese", "description": "Officials have recovered a boat that sank in rough weather off Thailand's southern resort island of Phuket in July, killing 47 Chinese tourists", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/thai-officials-recover-boat-that-sank-killing-47-chinese/2018/11/17/5ae8e6ec-ea73-11e8-aff1-eec29b6f92ca_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:16:21Z", "content": "BANGKOK Officials on Saturday recovered a boat that sank in rough weather off Thailands southern resort island of Phuket in July, killing 47 Chinese tourists.

The Department of Health and Human Services has released a new edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. That sound you hear is Americans collectively sighing.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: Physical activity guidelines can be tough. As behavioral scientists with expertise in exercise motivation, we will be the first to admit that maintaining a physically active lifestyle isn\u2019t easy. This is what we do, and we don\u2019t even always hit the goal. Life is messy and often gets in the way of even the best intentions. Let\u2019s take a deep breath, unwrap these new guidelines and talk strategy.\n\nThe guidelines recommend that all adults do at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity at an intensity that elevates the heart rate. Older adults should add balance exercises. And with the exception of women who are pregnant or nursing, adults should lift weights using all major muscle groups at least twice a week.\n\nThe guidelines also recommend that school-age children and adolescents be active for 180 minutes per week. Preschoolers should be active throughout the day. You might be thinking, who has time for all this exercise?\n\nThe good news is that the guidelines now recognize that fitting in big blocks of time for exercise is not necessary to get health benefits. For the first time, the guidelines don\u2019t require that physical activity occurs in bouts of 10 consecutive minutes or more to be valid. All activity counts. So that climb up and down the stairs at work every day counts toward your goal (as long as you\u2019re raising your heart rate).\n\nThe new guidelines also emphasize a \u201cmove more, sit less\u201d message to encourage everyone to do just a little more physical activity and to spend a little bit less time sitting. Physical activity isn\u2019t all or nothing. Every little bit comes with health benefits, so if reaching the guideline seems overwhelming, that\u2019s okay. Just try to do a bit more than you did yesterday. Improvement counts as success whether you meet the guidelines or not.\n\nBut how? And when?\n\nIf you think the guidelines are overwhelming, you are not alone \u2014 this is one of the most common complaints about the guidelines we hear from the thousands of people we have studied and counseled in exercise programs. People often feel hopeless about changing their lifestyle dramatically. One way to tackle a large goal is to break it down into smaller pieces.\n\nConsider a marathon runner. No new runner starts off running 26 miles; each one has to build up to it. They break monstrous goals into smaller pieces that increase steadily over many months.\n\nYou can approach the new physical activity guidelines in the same way. By tracking your progress, using incrementally more challenging goals, and celebrating milestones of achievement, you can move yourself closer to reaching the big goal.\n\nThe first goal you set should be a pretty easy one \u2014 so easy you should be thinking, \u201cOh, come on! That is too easy!\u201d\n\nSay, for example, you get about 30 minutes of exercise per week. Could you increase to 35 minutes per week for the next three weeks? Once you\u2019ve nailed 35 minutes for two to three weeks, bump it up to 40 minutes. The idea here is that you are building slowly, getting used to each step before moving onto the next step. Each step is also enhancing your physical fitness and conditioning so the next step won\u2019t feel much more difficult than the one before. From a time-management perspective, sneaking in an extra five minutes here and there is also far easier than finding time blocks of 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nIf you are far from 150 minutes right now, forget about 150 at the moment. Come up with a goal that is \u201cOh, come on!\u201d easy and then go from there. You can track your progress with wearable devices, smartphone apps or good old-fashioned pen and paper. However you track your progress, it is important to have a plan that you can track and keep trying to raise the bar for yourself \u2014 ever so gently.\n\nThe experts call physical activity the \u201cbest buy\u201d in public health. And the guidelines are based on evidence from thousands of studies. With this evidence, an expert panel concluded that exercise increases our life spans, prevents that sneaky annual weight gain and reduces the risk of almost every chronic disease: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many cancers. No other single behavior can do as much good for your health. By investing some time into exercise now, you get to cash in later. Think of it as a 401(k) plan for a long, healthy and happy life.\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t always make decisions in our long-term self-interest. We are wired more toward immediate rewards, and many health benefits of physical activity take years to appear. Some may be hard to notice at all, like preventing heart disease.\n\nFortunately, exercise has many immediate benefits. One of the biggest is the \u201cfeel good\u201d effect afterward. People consistently feel more focused, less stressed and more energized after physical activity. Studies now show that regular physical activity can actually reduce anxiety and depression \u2014 with effects equal to antidepressant medication or psychotherapy. We are all just one workout away from feeling better than we do right now.\n\nOne word of caution: Be careful not to push too hard too soon. Exercising hard can feel unpleasant. Most people don\u2019t repeat activities that feel unpleasant. Find something you enjoy and keep it fun if you want that behavior change to stick. When you hear all the news about the new physical activity guidelines, try not to let it discourage you. Set the numbers aside for now and just ask yourself, \u201cHow can I move a little more and sit a little less than I do now \u2014 and how can I make it fun?\u201d\n\nYou got this.\n\nConroy is professor of kinesiology and human development at Pennsylvania State University.

Kim said Congress should determine whether Trump announced the deployment as a political ploy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see an ounce of politics when it comes to our troops,\u201d Kim said.\n\n[Amid a political minefield, the Army prepares at the border for a migrant caravan]\n\nTaking stock of Trump\u2019s policies, incoming lawmakers also cited the war in Syria, the mission in Afghanistan and the perennial debate over a new authorization for military force as other areas they would like to investigate.\n\nRep.

We never engaged in the practices suggested by Mr. Dixon. The womanizing issue has become a major one in Hart's campaign because it raises questions concerning the candidate's judgment and integrity. That's why we reported on this story.\"\n\nThe story appeared just three weeks after Hart formally announced his candidacy. During that time, he was faced with questions about womanizing and his unpaid $1.3 million debt from his 1984 presidential race. His advisers had hoped that the focus would move on to substantive issues.\n\nThe story\u2019s publication also coincided with an Iowa Poll showing that Hart has increased his enormous lead over rivals in that state, which will hold the first 1988 presidential caucus.

He said that Lee Hart was with Hart at the party.\n\nHart and Rice met again in March \u2014 March 1, according to the Miami Herald \u2014 when Hart and Broadhurst were in Miami, where Hart had a fundraising event. They were on a chartered boat, and Rice and a friend, Lynn Armandt, came on board for about an hour, Dixon said. He said Hart did not remember Rice from the first meeting, so she said to him, \u201cHey, I know you, you're Senator Hart.\"\n\nAt the time, Armandt told Broadhurst that she was looking for a job in Washington and he offered to interview her as a caretaker for the townhouses he owns on Capitol Hill, Dixon said. Armandt came up last Friday for the interview and asked Rice to accompany her because she wasn't comfortable staying alone in the home of a stranger.\n\nAccording to Dixon, Armandt's job interview took place midafternoon Friday, then Broadhurst drove her to the airport to meet Rice. Coincidentally, Hart flew in to National Airport about the same time and the four of them drove back to Broadhurst's house where they had dinner together.\n\nAt about 11:15 p.m. the four walked to Hart\u2019s Capitol Hill townhouse, which is about three blocks away on Sixth Street SE, according to Dixon. He said they wanted to see a deck being built on the top of Hart\u2019s townhouse; then Broadhurst, Armandt and Rice returned to Broadhurst\u2019s apartment while Hart stayed at his house alone.\n\nThis statement contradicts the Herald report.\n\nThe Herald said it was told by a \u201cconfidential source\u201d that Hart was interested in a Miami woman and that she planned to go to Washington for the weekend. The Herald did not know Rice\u2019s name and had no information beyond a general description of her as an attractive blond actress in her late 20s, according to Jim Savage, a Knight Ridder editor who was on the surveillance team.\n\nInvestigative reporter Jim McGee boarded Eastern flight 996 last Friday afternoon and saw two women on the plane who met the general description. One was \u201clovingly\u201d met in Washington by a boyfriend, and McGee lost track of the second. After checking in with the Knight Ridder bureau, he went to Hart\u2019s house and saw the second woman emerge with Hart at about 9:15 p.m., according to Savage.\n\n\"We almost didn't send anyone up to Washington because our information was so minimal,\u201d Savage said. \u201cIt was just an informed coincidence that Jim was on the same plane, and that's what got us charged up.\"\n\nHerald reporter Tom Fiedler said the Herald team had the front and rear entrance to Hart's Capitol Hill townhouse under surveillance from about 9 p.m. Friday to about 10 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe Herald surveillance team included reporters Fiedler and McGee, editors Savage and Doug Clifton and photographer Brian Smith.\n\n\"We had three cars that we parked legally on the street, where we had a view of the front and rear entrance of the townhouse,\u201d Fiedler said. \u201cThere were a minimum of two people who watched through Friday night and five of us at various times on Saturday.\u201d Fiedler said he joined the group about 10 a.m. Saturday.\n\nThe Herald reporters parked one of their cars across the street from Hart\u2019s townhouse. \u201cWe had a clear vantage point of his front door,\u201d Fiedler said. The second car was parked in the alley driveway that runs by the rear door to the townhouse, he said. A third car was parked near the corner of Sixth and E streets, he said.\n\nAt 9:30 p.m., according to Fiedler, McGee saw Hart and the Miami woman leave Hart's townhouse. McGee saw them return to the townhouse at about 11:17 p.m. Friday.\n\nThe team of McGee and Clifton remained on surveillance until about 10:30 a.m. Saturday, when they were relieved by Fiedler, Savage and Smith.\n\nMcGee and Clifton, after napping and eating, returned to the Hart townhouse at about 4 p.m. Saturday, Fiedler said.\n\n\"All five of us were there when Hart and the girl emerged at about 8:50 p.m. Saturday,\u201d Fiedler said. The pair left by the rear entrance and walked around the block toward Hart's car. But instead of getting into the car, the two returned to the townhouse by the front door.\n\nHart came out alone about 30 minutes later, drove around the block, parked and walked several nearby streets.\n\nFiedler said that Hart apparently became aware that he was being watched Saturday evening when he came out of the townhouse with the woman. \u201cThat is when he seemed to get very spooked and dashed back into the house, instead of getting into the car,\u201d Fiedler said.\n\nAt about 10 p.m. Saturday, as Hart was about to reenter his townhouse, he was met by Fiedler, McGee and Savage. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go inside,\u201d Fiedler said. \u201cWe stood outside and interviewed him.\"\n\nIt was during this interview that Hart denied having a personal relationship with Rice but acknowledged telephoning her from around the country.\n\nStaff writers T.R.

He said that Lee Hart was with Hart at the party.\n\nHart and Rice met again in March \u2014 March 1, according to the Miami Herald \u2014 when Hart and Broadhurst were in Miami, where Hart had a fundraising event. They were on a chartered boat, and Rice and a friend, Lynn Armandt, came on board for about an hour, Dixon said. He said Hart did not remember Rice from the first meeting, so she said to him, \u201cHey, I know you, you're Senator Hart.\"\n\nAt the time, Armandt told Broadhurst that she was looking for a job in Washington and he offered to interview her as a caretaker for the townhouses he owns on Capitol Hill, Dixon said. Armandt came up last Friday for the interview and asked Rice to accompany her because she wasn't comfortable staying alone in the home of a stranger.\n\nAccording to Dixon, Armandt's job interview took place midafternoon Friday, then Broadhurst drove her to the airport to meet Rice. Coincidentally, Hart flew in to National Airport about the same time and the four of them drove back to Broadhurst's house where they had dinner together.\n\nAt about 11:15 p.m. the four walked to Hart\u2019s Capitol Hill townhouse, which is about three blocks away on Sixth Street SE, according to Dixon. He said they wanted to see a deck being built on the top of Hart\u2019s townhouse; then Broadhurst, Armandt and Rice returned to Broadhurst\u2019s apartment while Hart stayed at his house alone.\n\nThis statement contradicts the Herald report.\n\nThe Herald said it was told by a \u201cconfidential source\u201d that Hart was interested in a Miami woman and that she planned to go to Washington for the weekend. The Herald did not know Rice\u2019s name and had no information beyond a general description of her as an attractive blond actress in her late 20s, according to Jim Savage, a Knight Ridder editor who was on the surveillance team.\n\nInvestigative reporter Jim McGee boarded Eastern flight 996 last Friday afternoon and saw two women on the plane who met the general description. One was \u201clovingly\u201d met in Washington by a boyfriend, and McGee lost track of the second. After checking in with the Knight Ridder bureau, he went to Hart\u2019s house and saw the second woman emerge with Hart at about 9:15 p.m., according to Savage.\n\n\"We almost didn't send anyone up to Washington because our information was so minimal,\u201d Savage said. \u201cIt was just an informed coincidence that Jim was on the same plane, and that's what got us charged up.\"\n\nHerald reporter Tom Fiedler said the Herald team had the front and rear entrance to Hart's Capitol Hill townhouse under surveillance from about 9 p.m. Friday to about 10 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe Herald surveillance team included reporters Fiedler and McGee, editors Savage and Doug Clifton and photographer Brian Smith.\n\n\"We had three cars that we parked legally on the street, where we had a view of the front and rear entrance of the townhouse,\u201d Fiedler said. \u201cThere were a minimum of two people who watched through Friday night and five of us at various times on Saturday.\u201d Fiedler said he joined the group about 10 a.m. Saturday.\n\nThe Herald reporters parked one of their cars across the street from Hart\u2019s townhouse. \u201cWe had a clear vantage point of his front door,\u201d Fiedler said. The second car was parked in the alley driveway that runs by the rear door to the townhouse, he said. A third car was parked near the corner of Sixth and E streets, he said.\n\nAt 9:30 p.m., according to Fiedler, McGee saw Hart and the Miami woman leave Hart's townhouse. McGee saw them return to the townhouse at about 11:17 p.m. Friday.\n\nThe team of McGee and Clifton remained on surveillance until about 10:30 a.m. Saturday, when they were relieved by Fiedler, Savage and Smith.\n\nMcGee and Clifton, after napping and eating, returned to the Hart townhouse at about 4 p.m. Saturday, Fiedler said.\n\n\"All five of us were there when Hart and the girl emerged at about 8:50 p.m. Saturday,\u201d Fiedler said. The pair left by the rear entrance and walked around the block toward Hart's car. But instead of getting into the car, the two returned to the townhouse by the front door.\n\nHart came out alone about 30 minutes later, drove around the block, parked and walked several nearby streets.\n\nFiedler said that Hart apparently became aware that he was being watched Saturday evening when he came out of the townhouse with the woman. \u201cThat is when he seemed to get very spooked and dashed back into the house, instead of getting into the car,\u201d Fiedler said.\n\nAt about 10 p.m. Saturday, as Hart was about to reenter his townhouse, he was met by Fiedler, McGee and Savage. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go inside,\u201d Fiedler said. \u201cWe stood outside and interviewed him.\"\n\nIt was during this interview that Hart denied having a personal relationship with Rice but acknowledged telephoning her from around the country.\n\nStaff writers T.R.

Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) has received criticism over his opposition to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) becoming speaker of the House. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Seth Moulton, the hard-charging Marine who served four tours of duty in Iraq, is leading the challenge to Rep. Nancy Pelosi and her bid for speaker \u2014 and is suddenly taking incoming political fire from all quarters.\n\nProminent liberal activists are openly floating a primary challenge to the two-term Massachusetts congressman, the instigator of the nearly 20 Democratic foes to Pelosi and one who helped recruit several of the incoming freshmen opposing her.\n\nOutraged by the treatment of the first female House speaker, Pelosi\u2019s backers have characterized the effort as a sexist putsch and urged calls to Moulton\u2019s office as well as the other male Democratic opponents.\n\nInside the House, Moulton\u2019s ambition and sharp elbows have long been a subject of his colleagues\u2019 grumbling, and his latest fusillade at Pelosi \u2014 this time, after a sweeping electoral win \u2014 has angered even some of his admirers.\n\n\u201cIs he rubbing people the wrong way with how he\u2019s perceived in this? I would say, yeah,\u201d Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said.\n\n\u201cLet me get this straight \u2014 17 or 18 who aren\u2019t happy can block the will of over 200 members of the caucus? Where does that end?\u201d he added. \u201cWith his zeal for revolution, there\u2019s a lot of wounded left on the battlefield.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the Democratic victory, Moulton is sparking intraparty warfare \u2014 and infuriating liberals and women around the country \u2014 by trying to block Pelosi from reclaiming the gavel in January.\n\nMoulton, 40, and the dozen-plus incumbents and newly elected members insist the House needs new leadership, not the 78-year-old California congresswoman who engineered a Democratic takeover of the House, flipping 36 seats and counting.\n\n\u201cIf that many seats change hands, that\u2019s just all the more reason the American people are calling out for change,\u201d Moulton said in a recent interview. \u201cSo for our party to respond by saying, \u2018. . . We\u2019re going to reinstall the exact same status quo leadership that you voted out many years ago.\u2019 It\u2019s just shooting ourselves in the foot. It guarantees a two-year majority.\u201d\n\nMoulton also offers a more personal reason for opposing Pelosi: the military leader\u2019s ethos of accountability. After losing four-straight election cycles, he says, she shouldn\u2019t see her slate wiped clean after finally helping to win a majority back.\n\n\u201cNever took responsibility for anything, and that\u2019s not what leaders do,\u201d he said. \u201cA good selfless leader shares the credit for a win and owns mistakes.\u201d\n\nPelosi has dismissed Moulton\u2019s challenge and insists she has the votes.\n\n\u201cI will be speaker of the House no matter what he says,\u201d she said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s wrong,\u201d Moulton fired back Thursday. \u201cWe have the votes.\u201d\n\nMoulton\u2019s determination is rooted in the Marine Corps, where he rose from a stint leading a combat infantry platoon in Iraq to becoming a top aide to Gen. David Petraeus.\n\nAfter leaving the Marines and graduating from Harvard Business School, Moulton vaulted into politics by challenging nine-term Democratic Rep. John Tierney who represented his childhood home on Massachusetts\u2019s North Shore.\n\nTierney enjoyed close ties to Pelosi \u2014 her daughter served as his top aide for a time \u2014 and won her endorsement and fundraising help. But Moulton scored a 10-point victory in a hard-fought primary \u2014 and with it, a measure of independence from the party leadership.\n\nSince being elected, Moulton has established a reliably liberal voting record with an occasional maverick streak.\n\nWinning a coveted seat on the Armed Services Committee, he emerged as a vocal critic of the Obama administration\u2019s strategy in Iraq and to combat the Islamic State. He has aligned with Republicans on some policy bills, ranging from a ban on the gun accessories used in last year\u2019s mass shooting in Las Vegas to a recent legislation allowing veterans to use medical marijuana.\n\nMoulton has earned an outsize measure of credibility by giving early backing and financial support to a cadre of young insurgents who ran successful campaigns in red-tinted districts across the country.\n\nThanks to a network of donors rooted in the financial centers of Boston and New York, Moulton\u2019s Serve America PAC and related political committees raised a combined $8 million for the election cycle, putting him in the top echelon of Democratic fundraisers in the House.\n\nStarting with Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), whose narrow special-election victory in a heavily Republican district last March heralded the coming Democratic wave, Moulton provided crucial early support to a network of fellow veterans and public-service alumni \u2014 10 of whom will join Congress in January.\n\nSix have made clear that they will not support Pelosi as speaker \u2014 Reps.-elect Jason Crow (Colo.), Jared Golden (Maine), Max Rose (N.Y.), Mikie Sherrill (N.J.), Elissa Slotkin (Mich.) and Abigail Spanberger (Va.) \u2014 with the others undecided.\n\nThe group includes several of the breakout stars of the freshman class \u2014 such as Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot; Spanberger, a former CIA clandestine agent; and Crow, a former Army officer. With Moulton serving as a mentor, the group has coalesced though a long-running Slack chat into an informal caucus of sorts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to stay as close as possible,\u201d Crow said Thursday. \u201cWe share values, we share that background experience. A lot of us campaigned and talked about very similar approaches to getting things done here, so we\u2019re certainly going to stick close together.\u201d\n\nThat cohesion does not necessarily extend to the question of the House leadership; Moulton said there is no litmus test on Pelosi to win his support, and four of the freshmen said in interviews that Moulton was not a factor in their decisions.\n\nBut the support network, Moulton said, can help give Pelosi\u2019s freshman opponents the wherewithal to stand their ground amid intense pressure to back down.\n\n\u201cThese are all independent people who aren\u2019t afraid to do the right thing if it means going against the party,\u201d Moulton said.\n\nSpeculation abounds that Moulton has his eye on everything from the Senate seat now occupied by Democratic Sen. Edward J. Markey to the Massachusetts governor\u2019s mansion to the presidency. He denies having any immediate ambition to do anything but force a leadership shake-up.\n\nPelosi aides and allies see Moulton as a disingenuous egotist more interested in self-promotion than fulfilling his party\u2019s agenda \u2014 a perception that was underscored last year when the Boston Globe published a long, effusive thank-you note to Pelosi that he sent in 2016, barely two months before Moulton unsuccessfully moved to oust her.\n\nRep. Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.), who represents a neighboring district, declined to comment on Moulton but said the quest to oust Pelosi put Democrats, \u201cespecially our newly elected members . . . in an extremely difficult position.\u201d\n\nOff the Hill, criticism of Moulton among his party\u2019s liberal base is increasingly withering.\n\nMarkos Moulitsas, the influential founder of the DailyKos blog, mused early Friday about defeating Moulton in a primary. Other prominent liberal activists have slammed him online as \u201ctraitorous\u201d and as one of the \u201cwhite male ringleaders of this divisive [cow manure].\u201d\n\n\u201c#MA06 will be fun in 2020. So who wants to step up? The money will be there. @sethmoulton and the #FiveWhiteGuys are done,\u201d Moulitsas tweeted.\n\nA spokesman for Moulton acknowledged critical phone calls and messages to his office have spiked, but said so have supportive ones.\n\nOne Moulton argument against Pelosi is purely brass-tacks politics: Pelosi remains a drag on Democratic candidates running in Republican-leaning seats. Pelosi backers point to the election results.\n\n\u201cThere were so many people who said, \u2018Oh my god, if Nancy Pelosi is the leader, we could never win the House of Representatives!\u2019 My friends, the proof is in the pudding,\u201d said Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn).\n\nThe endgame Moulton & Co. have in mind remains unclear. They still have not been able to recruit an alternative to run against Pelosi in the Nov. 28 caucus elections, though Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who is close to Moulton, is pondering a run.\n\nIn any case, Moulton says, the showdown is destined to last until lawmakers cast their speaker votes on the House floor on Jan. 3 \u2014 the moment when his group will have leverage to push Pelosi aside. He predicted the freshmen who received his support and who are opposing Pelosi would ultimately stand firm.\n\n\u201cGod knows she\u2019s a good arm-twister,\u201d he said of Pelosi, \u201cbut it\u2019s clearly not the right thing to do for the party or for the country or for their own reelection prospects.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Egyptian sentenced to death for killing Christian doctor", "description": "Egypt has sentenced an alleged Islamic State supporter to death for stabbing and killing an 82-year-old Christian doctor in Cairo", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egyptian-sentenced-to-death-for-killing-christian-doctor/2018/11/17/1eb52314-ea57-11e8-aff1-eec29b6f92ca_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T10:54:14Z", "content": "CAIRO Egypt has sentenced an alleged Islamic State supporter to death for stabbing and killing an 82-year-old Christian doctor in Cairo.

(Frank Franklin II/AP)\n\nNearly a year ago, on Nov. 21, the Zimbabwean armed forces toppled Robert Mugabe after a week of attempts to coerce him to resign from the presidency. The coup surprised many observers, as the armed forces had long supported Mugabe\u2019s tenure. Afterward, the coup plotters tried to convince observers, both at home and internationally, that it wasn\u2019t in fact a coup. Rather, their aim was to fix what they saw as Zimbabwe\u2019s deteriorating political, social and economic conditions \u2014 or so they tried to persuade the world. For instance, soon after taking power in December, the new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, promised \u201cfree and fair\u201d elections in \u201cfour to five months.\u201d\n\nSometimes coups can lead to democracy (but don\u2019t try this at home)\n\nSome observers did indeed hope that Zimbabwe was on the cusp of real democracy. And they had some reason for optimism. Economist Paul Collier suggested a decade ago that coups could sometimes remove dictators, specifically mentioning Mugabe as a potential target. Constitutional law scholar Ozan Varol expanded on this idea in his simply titled book, \u201cThe Democratic Coup d\u2019\u00c9tat.\u201d We believe that encouraging coups as a way to promote democracy can be disastrous. However, coups are followed by democracy more often than most people realize, as we will explain below.\n\nHere\u2019s how we did our research\n\nWe plotted data from One Earth Future\u2019s (OEF) Rulers, Elections and Irregular Governance (REIGN) project to see how often democracies do in fact emerge after coups.\n\nYou can see the results in the figure below. Red lines show 232 coups from around the world since 1950, while the blue lines show coups only in Africa. We also distinguish coups after the Cold War, the end of which is shown as a solid line, from all coups since 1950.\n\nMoving from left to right, the figure shows the proportion of countries in which the REIGN data assesses its governance as democratic, checking every six months after the coup for up to three years following the event.\n\nProbability of post-coup democratization\n\nWe can see two major trends. The first is that African countries\u2019 democratic prospects after coups are in line with those of the rest of the world \u2014 despite the fact that many in the international community view the prospects of democracy in Africa with some pessimism. And that\u2019s true no matter when the coup takes place, before or after the Cold War\u2019s end.\n\nSecond, coups are substantially more likely to lead to democracy after the Cold War. That\u2019s especially notable, given how rarely countries shift from autocracy to democracy at all, coups or no coups.\n\nResearchers investigating why coups sometimes lead to democracy have concluded, variously, that successful coup plotters once in power seeking domestic and international legitimacy will sometimes attempt to establish democratic practices such as holding elections. Fewer scholars have paid attention to the effects of existing political traditions and sources of power. For instance, a previously entrenched political party that has ruled undemocratically, like the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), may overthrow a particular leader without being willing to step away from power altogether.\n\nThat can be a serious obstacle to democracy.\n\nZimbabwe after the coup\n\nAfter removing Mugabe, Mnangagwa and the ZANU-PF at first sought to allay fears about the fairness of the upcoming election. The new regime allowed more international election observers than had the old. And the 2018 campaigns were relatively peaceful, when compared with campaigning under Mugabe.\n\nAnd yet some voters were intimidated and threatened with violence. Those threats were mainly aimed at those who supported Nelson Chamisa, the candidate of the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. Civil society groups noted that the local media\u2019s campaign coverage heavily favored the incumbent ZANU-PF and scarcely mentioned other candidates.\n\nThe biggest shortfall, however, was that the July 30 election itself was conducted in ways that fell short of international standards. The opposition challenged the vote-tallying process, arguing that the ZANU-PF rigged the vote. When protesters gathered after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced Mnangagwa\u2019s victory, police and armed forces fired on them, using live ammunition and killing at least six people, as protesters fought back with stones. Police then raided opposition headquarters, detaining workers for questioning.\n\nInternational observers suggested that the election results were not credible. Opposition leader Chamisa challenged Mnangagwa\u2019s victory in court, but a ruling by Zimbabwe\u2019s constitutional court upheld the win. The U.S. delegation reported that the country had not demonstrated that it had put in place measures to ensure free, fair and credible elections. The E.U. observer mission identified several difficulties, including a lack of transparency in vote tallying and delays in court hearings for those challenging election results, and concluded that the election did not meet international standards.\n\n[Even after Mugabe, Zimbabwe\u2019s elections do not appear free or fair]\n\nHowever, observer missions of several African intergovernmental organizations, including the African Union, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, and the Southern African Development Community hailed Zimbabwe\u2019s election process as \u201clargely free and fair\u201d and representing \u201ca turning point for Zimbabwe.\u201d\n\nDominant parties often hang on to power after coups\n\nCertainly, the 2018 elections were better than previous Zimbabwean elections, at least in the high voter turnout and calm observed on election day. But it does not appear to have been a turning point toward democracy. Throughout the electioneering period, the ZANU-PF showed that it would still go to great lengths to ensure that it retained power, much like Mugabe and other dictators who manipulate elections.\n\nWe\u2019ve found that\u2019s typical for governments that have been dominated by a single political party.\n\nIn the figure below, we plot the REIGN data to find how likely it is that different kinds of regimes, if overthrown by a coup, will be replaced by democracy. We found 19 coups against regimes that had been run by a dominant party like ZANU-PF, in which it was the party, not the individual leader, that held power. Of those, only one coup was followed by democracy.\n\nProbability of democracy, post-coup, by regime type\n\nSo what kinds of regimes, if overthrown, are indeed replaced with democracy? We found that happened after military dictatorships and those dictatorships where power is disproportionately held by a single person; in countries that were already democratic; or in regimes that were designed to be transitional, such as those following foreign occupation or a civil war.\n\nWe also looked at party-based dictatorships that involved the military or dictatorships in which power is disproportionately held by a single individual. We found 20 coups against such governments \u2014 none of which resulted in democracy within three years.\n\nIn all, of 39 coups against dictatorships that were in some way based on a dominant party, only one \u2014 the 1960 coup in Turkey \u2014 led to democracy.\n\nWhen dictators fall, there may indeed be a window in which the nation can transition to democratic rule. But that\u2019s far more challenging if the autocrat was part of a dominant political party that remains in power, like ZANU-PF.\n\nRead more Zimbabwe analysis here.\n\nMwita Chacha is an assistant professor of political science and international relations at Nazarbayev University in Astana, Kazakhstan.\n\nJonathan Powell is an associate professor of political science at the University of Central Florida."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Experts weigh the record of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal", "description": "Experts consider the costs and benefits of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal, which has tried and convicted a total of three defendants over nine years at a cost of more than $300 million", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/experts-weigh-the-record-of-cambodias-khmer-rouge-tribunal/2018/11/17/4c701474-ea4a-11e8-aff1-eec29b6f92ca_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T09:25:12Z", "content": "BANGKOK After spending nine years and more than $300 million to prosecute leaders of Cambodias Khmer Rouge responsible for the deaths of 1.7 million of their countrymen, a U.N.-assisted tribunal has ended up convicting only three people for the communist grou\u2026 [+6501 chars]", "fulltext": "BANGKOK \u2014 After spending nine years and more than $300 million to prosecute leaders of Cambodia\u2019s Khmer Rouge responsible for the deaths of 1.7 million of their countrymen, a U.N.-assisted tribunal has ended up convicting only three people for the communist group\u2019s heinous actions.\n\nWas it worth it?\n\nThese kinds of proceedings don\u2019t run cheap. The longer-running tribunals covering genocide in Rwanda and war crimes in the former Yugoslavia ran up costs of as much as $2 billion \u2014 though both tried many more people than were called to account in Cambodia for crimes committed during the 1975-79 regime of the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot.\n\nOn Friday, the tribunal convicted Nuon Chea, 92, and Khieu Samphan, 87, the last surviving Khmer Rouge leaders, of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and sentenced them to life in prison. The only other person who has been convicted is Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nJustice is the primary goal. But international tribunals, trying people accused of crimes on a national scale, also serve to promote human rights and establish a historical record, among other targets.\n\nEven the most bullish observers acknowledge the shortcomings of the Cambodian tribunal, officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC. The rules hammered out in extensive negotiations between the United Nations and the Cambodian government hobbled its proceedings in ways that were not always foreseeable.\n\n\n\nIn this photo released by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, Khieu Samphan, foreground, former Khmer Rouge head of state, stands at thea dock in a court room during a hearing at the U.N.-backed war crimes tribunal in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Friday, Nov. 16, 2018.

(Nhet Sok Heng/Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nThe ECCC was set up as a hybrid court, meaning every international prosecutor and judge was paired with a Cambodian counterpart. However, what was a political atmosphere encouraging cooperation when the U.N. agreement was signed in 2003 deteriorated, as democratic space has shrunk under Cambodia\u2019s long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen.\n\n\u201cHybrid courts require domestic and international partners to share the steering wheel. They tend to function well only when the two drivers want to head in the same general direction,\u201d said John Ciorciari, a professor at the University of Michigan and co-author of a book about the tribunal. \u201cWhen they do, mixed tribunals can help fill gaps in otherwise frail domestic systems. When interests clash, these efforts to share sovereignty are prone to crash.\u201d\n\nThe main case in point: Hun Sen \u2014 himself a former Khmer Rouge commander who defected from the group when it was in power \u2014 declaring no more suspects should be prosecuted, saying without justification that such action could cause unrest.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the U.N. agreement\u2019s vague wording of who could be targeted for prosecution \u2014 senior Khmer Rouge leaders and those most responsible for the atrocities \u2014 proved to be more restrictive than open-ended.\n\n\u201cAll tribunals of this character have political restraints, and so that is not unique to the ECCC,\u201d said David Scheffer, a law professor at Northwestern University and former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes. Other points he mentioned that delayed the proceedings included the protection of due process rights and the unusual combination of a civil law investigating judicial procedure alongside a common law prosecutorial model.\n\n\u201cOne can always surmise about more being done,\u201d said Scheffer, who also served as the U.N.\u2019s special expert on assistance to the Khmer Rouge trials. \u201cBut that was the negotiated reality of this particular tribunal.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he gave high marks to the tribunal\u2019s performance, saying its main contribution has been both domestic and international justice rendered against some of the major figures in the Pol Pot regime.\n\n\u201cThe Cambodian people sought justice and the ECCC delivered a significant measure of it,\u201d Scheffer said in an email interview. \u201cThe ECCC also established a historical record, albeit not comprehensive, that otherwise never would have been uncovered.\u201d\n\nAdama Dieng, the U.N. special adviser on the prevention of genocide, also said Friday\u2019s convictions showed that \u201cjustice will prevail, and that impunity should never be accepted for genocide and other atrocity crimes.\u201d\n\nPolitical education is an area where the tribunal has succeeded, said Heather Ryan, who has monitored the trials for the Open Society Justice Initiative, an independent international human rights organization.\n\n\u201cThe court has made a huge contribution to helping the world and Cambodians better understand what occurred during the Khmer Rouge regime,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cIt has triggered discussions at all levels of Cambodian society about not only the past, but concepts of impunity, justice and accountability relevant to the current political situation in Cambodia.\u201d\n\nOther observers were less impressed.\n\nTheary Seng, a U.S.-trained lawyer, writer and political analyst based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia\u2019s capital, who is an outspoken critic of Hun Sen\u2019s government, called the tribunal \u201ca complete failure for international justice\u201d because it didn\u2019t accomplish any of the established goals of reconciliation, symbolic justice and combating impunity.\n\nSeng, whose parents were killed by the Khmer Rouge, pointed out that the hope that at least some of the Cambodian judges, prosecutors and lawyers that the government placed in the tribunal would somehow become champions of judicial fairness and the rule of law has been the opposite of fulfilled: they have all been deeply implicated in government abuse and perversion of the domestic justice system.\n\nShe said her top concern now was for the integrity of the tribunal\u2019s documents to be preserved for researchers.\n\nIt is likely that the voluminous documentation used by the tribunal will be handed over to the government or institution controlled by the government, she said.\n\n\u201cThis means that the printed documents could be selectively destroyed and the electronic version could be subtly altered,\u201d she warned. \u201cFuture researchers writing the history of Cambodia will not know what\u2019s what.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sopheng Cheang in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Kara-Murza said the attacks bear the signature of Russian security services.\n\nKara-Murza, who is the vice chairman of Open Russia, a Russian-led pro-democracy organization, said Putin is aided by the West \u201ctreating him as a worthy and respectable partner on the world stage. Unfortunately so many Western leaders have done this for so long.\u201d\n\nOpen Russia is a nonprofit founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia\u2019s richest man, who was jailed in Russia on what he says are politically motivated tax charges. Khodorkovsky, in exile in Britain, also attended the ceremony.\n\nMagnitsky Awards are given to lawyers, journalists, activists and Western politicians who have fought injustice they describe as perpetrated by the Russian state.\n\nThey are the brainchild of Bill Browder, an American-born financier who was once the richest foreign investor in Russia. Wanted by Russia, which has an Interpol arrest warrant out for him, Browder named the awards after his lawyer, who died in a Russian jail in 2009 after exposing a massive fraud involving Russian officials. Magnitsky\u2019s family and friends say he was tortured and beaten to death by his jailers.\n\nThis led Browder to persuade Congress to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act, allowing the United States to restrict travel and freeze the assets of any individuals who have committed gross violations of human rights in Russia; the list of sanctioned Russians now stands at 49.\n\nThe Magnitsky Act is reviled by Russia, which has worked very hard to try stop it, including sending a Kremlin-linked lawyer to meet Donald Trump Jr. in 2016, where they discussed the possibility of repealing it.\n\nOne of the law\u2019s key advocates was Sen.

(John Locher/AP)\n\nThat could mean a long wait for friends and relatives of the missing.\n\nFriday would have been Dorothy Lee Mack\u2019s 88th birthday, and her sister-in-law hadn\u2019t heard from her since the fire swept through the Ridgewood Mobile Home Park, where Mack lived at number 19.\n\nMack is not one to give in easily, said her sister-in-law, Marian Mack. She survived polio when she was 10 and later a bout with cancer and two hip replacements. But Marian didn\u2019t know whether Dorothy would have heard the emergency officials who rushed among the mobile homes at about 6:30 a.m., ringing bells to wake their sleeping occupants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a terrible time,\u201d said Marian Mack, who sometimes visited on Dorothy\u2019s birthday. \u201cWe just have to wait and pray.\u201d\n\nThe Camp Fire has consumed 149,000 acres \u2014 an area the size of Chicago \u2014 and is 50 percent contained. But multiple fires continue to rage across the state. In Southern California, the Woolsey Fire has blazed across an area from Simi Valley to the multimillion-dollar beach homes in Malibu. At least three people have been killed in that fire.\n\nMore than 9,000 firefighters are working to contain the Camp and Woolsey fires with water tankers and helicopters, blazes that have destroyed more than 12,000 structures, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning in the Camp Fire region for Saturday night into Sunday, meaning high winds could cause the flames to spread rapidly. Authorities are adding fire crews to help prevent the fire from growing.\n\nThey\u2019re also widening efforts to identify human remains, posting \u201cRapid DNA\u201d machines near fire scenes. The technology allows relatives to supply their genetic material through a cheek swab and compare it with a database of unidentified victims in less than two hours.\n\nThe machines, about the size of a mini-fridge, are part of a new initiative that\u2019s being rolled out by law enforcement after receiving congressional approval last year. The FBI hopes to launch a pilot program for police to test suspects in booking stations and forward the results to state crime labs and the national DNA database early next year, the agency said.\n\nANDE, a Waltham, Mass., company, is one of two companies approved to supply the quick-analysis machines to the government, and sent six of them to various fire command posts on Wednesday, chief communications officer Annette Mattern said. The DNA samples collected there will only be used to identify victims, she said, and those machines are not connected to the national DNA database.\n\nAuthorities hope to encourage more relatives of the missing to use them. Only 17 DNA samples have been processed, they said.\n\n\n\nEvacuees from the Camp Fire shelter set up tents outside a Walmart in Chico, Calif. on Friday. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Friday, displaced residents who are camping out in a Walmart parking lot in Chico visited an abandoned Sears store where the Federal Emergency Management Agency had set up services.\n\nJeff Hansen, 37, waited for several hours to apply for emergency assistance for his nine-member family, including a 36-year-old brother with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair. He lost his house in Paradise, his workplace and one of his three cars in the fire.\n\n\u201cHopefully FEMA will help us,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nThe center also became a spot for impromptu reunions, as displaced residents ran into friends and neighbors who they feared had died in the fire.\n\nLindsay Nelson, 37, had been fretting for days about what happened to her 78-year-old drinking buddy, \u201cJay Jay.\u201d But when she saw him at the center, Nelson hugged him and snapped a photograph to post on Facebook.\n\n\u201cNo one had heard from him, we thought he was missing. So, so glad to see him and know he is okay,\u201d said Nelson, who had lived in Paradise but lost the home she was renting there. \u201cThis is such a relief. I don\u2019t want to hear any of my friends didn\u2019t make it, it would just be too hard with everything else going on.\u201d\n\nBut with the death toll set to rise, Nelson is still bracing for the worse.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, everyone knows they will know someone who didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is, we will need to build a memorial in Paradise.\u201d\n\n\n\nMembers of the Kern County Sheriff's search and rescue team look for human remains in a burned out neighborhood of Paradise, Calif. on Thursday.

Argentina\u2019s navy announced early Saturday that they have located the missing submarine ARA San Juan in the Atlantic, a year after it disappeared with 44 crew members aboard. (Pablo Stefanec/Associated Press)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 Hours after announcing the discovery of an Argentine submarine lost deep in the Atlantic a year ago with 44 crew members aboard, the government said Saturday that it is unable to recover the vessel, drawing anger from missing sailors\u2019 relatives who demanded that it be raised.\n\nDefense Minister Oscar Aguad said at a press conference that the country lacks \u201cmodern technology\u201d capable of \u201cverifying the seabed\u201d to extract the ARA San Juan, which was found 907 meters (2,975 feet) deep in waters off the Valdes Peninsula in Argentine Patagonia, roughly 600 kilometers (373 miles) from the port city of Comodoro Rivadavia.\n\nEarlier in the morning, the navy said a \u201cpositive identification\u201d had been made by a remote-operated submersible from the American company Ocean Infinity. The company, commissioned by the Argentine government, began searching for the missing vessel Sept. 7.\n\nIt remained unclear what the next steps could be.\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press, Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Plunkett said authorities would have to determine how to advance. \u201cWe would be pleased to assist with a recovery operation but at the moment are focused on completing imaging of the debris field,\u201d he said.\n\nNavy commander Jose Luis Villan urged \u201cprudence,\u201d saying that a federal judge was overseeing the investigation and would be the one to decide whether it was possible to recover a part or the entirety of the ship.\n\nWithout adequate technological capabilities, however, Argentina would likely need to seek assistance from foreign countries or pay Ocean Infinity or another company, potentially complicating its recent commitment to austerity. Argentina is currently facing a currency crisis and double-digit inflation that has led the government to announce sweeping measures to balance the budget and concretize a financing deal with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAny move to recuperate the vessel would also be a logistically large and challenging undertaking based on the submarine\u2019s distance from the coast, its depth, and the kind of seabed upon which it is resting.\n\nRelatives of crew members were determined to fight for it to be quickly surfaced.\n\nIsabel Vilca, the half sister of crewman Daniel Alejandro Polo, told the AP that the discovery was just the beginning.\n\nShe said families need to recover the remains of their loved ones to know what happened and help prevent similar tragedies.\n\n\u201cWe do know they can get it out because Ocean Infinity told us they can, that they have equipment,\u201d said Luis Antonio Niz, father of crew member Luis Niz. \u201cIf they sent him off, I want them to bring him back to me.\u201d\n\nThe sub\u2019s discovery was announced just two days after families of the missing sailors held a one-year commemoration for its disappearance on Nov. 15, 2017. The San Juan was returning to its base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata when contact was lost.\n\nOn the anniversary Thursday, Argentina President Mauricio Macri said the families of the submariners should not feel alone and delivered an \u201cabsolute and non-negotiable commitment\u201d to find \u201cthe truth.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Aguad said that the vessel was found to be in an area that investigators had deemed \u201cmost likely.\u201d\n\nOfficials showed images of the submarine, which was located on a seabed with its hull totally deformed. Parts of its propellers were buried and debris was scattered up to 70 meters (230 feet) away.\n\nThe German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in the mid-1980s and was most recently refitted between 2008 and 2014. During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts said refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers, and even the tiniest mistake during the cutting phase can put the safety of the ship and crew at risk.\n\nThe navy said previously the captain reported on Nov. 15, 2017, that water entered the snorkel and caused one of the sub\u2019s batteries to short-circuit. The captain later communicated that it had been contained.\n\nSome hours later, an explosion was detected near the time and place where the San Juan was last heard from. The navy said the blast could have been caused by a \u201cconcentration of hydrogen\u201d triggered by the battery problem reported by the captain.\n\nMacri promised a full investigation after the submarine was lost. Federal police raided naval bases and other buildings last January as part of the probe, soon after the government dismissed the head of the navy.\n\nArgentina gave up hope of finding survivors after an intense search aided by 18 countries, but a few navy units have continued providing logistical support to Ocean Infinity.\n\nOn Saturday, Plunkett tweeted: \u201cOur thoughts are with the many families affected by this terrible tragedy. We sincerely hope that locating the resting place of the ARA San Juan will be of some comfort to them at what must be a profoundly difficult time.\u201d\n\nHe also said: \u201cThis was an extremely challenging project and today\u2019s successful outcome, following the earlier search operations, firmly endorses our technology.\u201d\n\nThe company unsuccessfully searched for the Malaysia Airlines plane that disappeared in 2014 over the Indian Ocean.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Ocean Infinity is an American company, not ship.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Paul Byrne contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Thad Cochran, who stepped down because of health problems.\n\nShe is facing Espy, a black Democrat, in a runoff to determine who will serve the remaining two years of Cochran\u2019s term. Neither candidate was able to win more than 50 percent of the vote in the Nov. 6 special election.\n\nEspy and Hyde-Smith had the top two vote tallies, each receiving about 41 percent. If Espy were to win, he would become the first black senator to represent the state since the Reconstruction era. Espy served three terms in the House of Representatives, from 1987 to 1993.\n\nMany critics of Hyde-Smith\u2019s \u201cpublic lynching\u201d comment noted the history of racism and hangings in the state.

(Jim Mone/Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Kevin Garnett showed up courtside, and that wasn\u2019t the only surprise in Minnesota on Friday night.\n\nIn their first week without erstwhile defensive stalwart Jimmy Butler, the new-look Timberwolves locked down one of the Western Conference\u2019s top teams.\n\nAndrew Wiggins scored 23 points, Derrick Rose had 17 and the Wolves won their third straight game since trading Butler by beating the Portland Trail Blazers 112-96 on Friday night.\n\nWearing a new purple-and-black alternate jersey on a Prince-themed night, Garnett got the crowd going when the video board showed him sitting below the basket. Then the home team kept them cheering with a defensive effort that would\u2019ve made the Wolves icon \u2014 a ferocious defender in his prime \u2014 proud.\n\n\u201cIt was great to see him,\u201d Karl-Anthony Towns said. \u201cIt was a long conversation with me and him to get him to come. So I\u2019m happy he came and we played really well as a team.\n\n\u201cAll he wants to do is see Minnesota succeed, so I\u2019m just happy we gave him something to cheer about.\u201d\n\nThe Wolves entered the game allowed opposing teams to score an average of 116.2 points per game. They held the Blazers \u2014 who were averaging 115.9 per game \u2014 to their season low.\n\nTowns and Robert Covington each had 14 points for the Wolves, who are 7-1 at home and 3-0 since trading the disgruntled Butler to Philadelphia on Monday.\n\nRose cautioned against reading too much into the success.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure things out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always great to go 3-0, and we\u2019re just trying to keep it going, taking it one game at a time.\u201d\n\nThe Timberwolves\u2019 lineup had a balanced night, with all five starters scoring in double figures.\n\nIt was a stark difference from the last time the teams met nearly two weeks ago, when the Blazers held Minnesota to 81 points \u2014 the lowest point total in the NBA this season. The Wolves were without Butler, Jeff Teague and Rose for that game.\n\n\u201cI just think they have a new feel, a new lease on life in a sense,\u201d Evan Turner said. \u201cAnytime you get a trade and things like that, they feel good. They played well.\u201d\n\nLOSING ON THE TRAIL\n\nThe Blazers have their first losing streak of the season \u2014 not the start they wanted for their six-game trip.\n\nCJ McCollum had 18 points and Damian Lillard added 16 for Portland, which never led. The Blazers got within six in the third quarter before Minnesota closed the period on a 21-11 run by attacking the basket. The Blazers committed 18 turnovers, leading to 22 Wolves points.\n\n\u201cThe ball is in my hands a lot and the team counts on me to take care of the ball and make sure that we get quality possessions. I didn\u2019t do a great job of that,\u201d said Lillard, who had five turnovers.\n\nTHE COLOR PURPLE\n\nThe Wolves debuted their \u201ccity edition\u201d uniforms that pay homage to hometown music legend Prince, who filmed his iconic nightclub scenes of the 1984 movie Purple Rain across the street from where Target Center was later built. Prince music played all night.\n\n\u201cI know our players are really excited about the uniforms and the night. It\u2019s a great way to honor Prince,\u201d coach Tom Thibodeau said.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTrail Blazers: Lillard had five assists to pass Damon Stoudamire (3,018) for third on the team\u2019s career list. He has 3,020 for his career. ... G Seth Curry sat out with a bruised right knee from the first quarter of Wednesday night\u2019s loss to the Lakers. Curry said Thursday his goal was to return during the team\u2019s current six-game road trip.\n\nTimberwolves: Taj Gibson had a season-high five assists, and Teague had a game-high eight. . F Anthony Tolliver didn\u2019t play for the second straight game. He told local media Friday that Thibodeau didn\u2019t talk to him about not playing in Wednesday night\u2019s win against New Orleans. Thibodeau, known for playing with a short bench, defended the decision to not play the usually reliable veteran. \u201cIf you try to play too many then everyone plays poorly. So you try to make a decision, you gather information and it usually works out.

(Aaron Favila/Associated Press)\n\nPORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea \u2014 Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence traded barbs in speeches at a summit of world leaders Saturday, outlining competing visions for global leadership as trade and other tensions between them simmer.\n\nPence said there would be no letup in President Donald Trump\u2019s policy of combating China\u2019s mercantilist trade policy and intellectual property theft that has erupted into a tit-for-tat tariff war between the two world powers this year.\n\nThe U.S. has imposed additional tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods and China has retaliated. Pence reiterated Trump administration threats to more than double the penalties.\n\n\u201cThe United States, though, will not change course until China changes its ways,\u201d Pence said, accusing Beijing of intellectual property theft, unprecedented subsidies for state businesses and \u201ctremendous\u201d barriers to foreign companies entering its giant market.\n\nPence announced the U.S. would be involved in ally Australia\u2019s plan to develop a naval base in Papua New Guinea, where the summit is being held. China has been intensely wooing Papua New Guinea and other Pacific island nations with aid and loans for infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOur vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific will prevail,\u201d Pence said.\n\nThe vice president harshly criticized China\u2019s global infrastructure drive, known as the \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d calling many of the projects low quality that also saddle developing countries with loans they can\u2019t afford.\n\nThe U.S., a democracy, is a better partner than authoritarian China, he said.\n\n\u201cKnow that the United States offers a better option. We don\u2019t drown our partners in a sea of debt, we don\u2019t coerce, compromise your independence,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe do not offer constricting belt or a one-way road. When you partner with us, we partner with you and we all prosper.\u201d\n\nXi, who spoke before Pence, anticipated many of the U.S. criticisms in his speech. He said countries are facing a choice of cooperation or confrontation as protectionism and unilateralism spreads.\n\nXi expressed support for the global free trading system that has underpinned his country\u2019s rise over the past quarter century to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy after the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe rules made should not be followed or bent as one sees fit and they should not be applied with double standards for selfish agendas,\u201d Xi said.\n\n\u201cMankind has once again reached a crossroads,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich direction should we choose? Cooperation or confrontation? Openness or closing doors. Win-win progress or a zero sum game?\u201d\n\nResponding to a chorus of criticism of China\u2019s international infrastructure drive, Xi said it was not a trap or power grab.\n\n\u201cIt is not designed to serve any hidden geopolitical agenda, it is not targeted against anyone and it does not exclude anyone,\u201d Xi said. \u201cIt is not an exclusive club that is closed to non-members, nor is it a trap as some people have labeled it.\u201d\n\nLeaders of 21 Pacific Rim countries and territories that make up 60 percent of the world economy are meeting in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, for an annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\n\nThey are struggling to reach agreement on a joint declaration, particularly whether to push for changes to the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for trade and can penalize nations that breach them.\n\nWTO member nations have been unable to reach agreement on further freeing up trade for years and the organization is in danger of atrophy.\n\nTwo thirds of its members claim developing nation status that allows them to take advantage of benefits and exemptions to obligations not granted to advanced economies, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The U.S., meanwhile, believes the WTO\u2019s arbitration body has made decisions beyond its mandate.\n\nAPEC is also facing questions about its future. Malaysia\u2019s 93-year-old Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said it will become irrelevant if developing nations continue to be left behind by globalization and free trade.\n\nChina\u2019s territorial claims to most of the South China Sea that borders Southeast Asian nations were also a target in Pence\u2019s speech.\n\nChina has demanded the U.S. stop deploying ships and military aircraft close to its man-made islands in the disputed waters after American and Chinese ships nearly collided near a contested reef in September. But Pence stressed Saturday that the U.S. won\u2019t back off.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows and our national interest demands,\u201d he said. \u201cHarassment will only strengthen our resolve. We will not change course.\u201d\n\nWashington will continue to support efforts by Southeast Asian nations to negotiate a legally binding \u201ccode of conduct\u201d with China \u201cthat respects the rights of all nations, including the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea,\u201d Pence said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She told CBS affiliate KCTV that she does not want to be part of the story.\n\nLeavenworth County Administrator Mark Loughry said that media accounts of Klemp\u2019s comments are not accurate, and that Klemp meant to say he and the woman are part of a master race because they both have a gap in their front teeth. Loughry said Klemp has made such a reference several times in the past about people who have a gap in their teeth.\n\n\u201cThe use of the term \u2018Master Race,\u2019 as ill-advised as it may be, was not a reference to Nazis or used in a racist manner in this instance,\u201d Loughry said in a statement. \u201cLeavenworth County has a zero tolerance for racism or discrimination in any form from any staff members.

(Ahn Young-joon/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea says it is expelling American Bruce Byron Lowrance after he slipped unlawfully into the police state known for its anti-U.S. fervor.\n\nHe is believed to be the same person who was deported by South Korea a year ago after being caught wandering near the mine-strewn border with North Korea, looking for a way to cross over.\n\nSneaking into North Korea has proved to be a powerful temptation for some Americans. Some were driven by religious zeal, others simply were attracted by the mystery of a remote and cloistered country that seems the polar opposite of anything they had experienced.\n\nA look at some of the Americans who have entered North Korea in past decades:\n\n___\n\nBRUCE BYRON LOWRANCE\n\nThe North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Lowrance was detained last month after he entered illegally from the border with China. While it said he entered under the \u201cmanipulation\u201d of the CIA, many detained foreigners have said after their release from North Korea that their declarations of guilt were coerced.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s decision to deport Lowrance after only a month of confinement would be remarkably quick by Pyongyang\u2019s standards, apparently reflecting an eagerness to keep alive a positive atmosphere for dialogue with the United States.\n\nWashington and Pyongyang have been engaging in talks on the North\u2019s nuclear program since a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in June, when they issued vague aspirational goals for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn November last year, South Korea said a man matching Lowrance\u2019s name was caught in an area just south of the Demilitarized Zone without approval. The man later told South Korean investigators that he believed his trip to North Korea would resolve tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over the death of Otto Warmbier, an American university student who died last year days after being released from the North in a coma.\n\nLowrance was arrested in South Korea on the same day a North Korean soldier made a dramatic escape to the South, rushing across the border under a barrage of bullets fired by his former comrades.\n\n___\n\nOTTO WARMBIER\n\nWhile the majority of Americans detained by North Korea have been released in relatively good condition, Warmbier, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, died in June last year shortly after he was flown home comatose after 17 months in captivity.\n\nWarmbier was seized from a tour group while visiting North Korea in January 2016 and convicted on charges of trying to steal a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. North Korea has denied accusations by relatives that it tortured Warmbier and said he was provided \u201cmedical treatments and care with all sincerity.\u201d The North accused the United States of a smear campaign and called itself the \u201cbiggest victim\u201d in his death.\n\n___\n\nMATTHEW MILLER\n\nIn September 2014 North Korea sentenced Miller \u2014 then a 24-year-old from Bakersfield, California \u2014 to six years of hard labor on charges he illegally entered the country to commit espionage.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Supreme Court said Miller tore up his tourist visa at Pyongyang\u2019s airport upon arrival in April that year and admitted to the \u201cwild ambition\u201d of experiencing prison life so that he could secretly investigate North Korea\u2019s human rights situation.\n\nMiller was freed in November that year along with another American, Kenneth Bae, a missionary and tour leader.\n\nWeeks before his release, Miller spoke briefly to The Associated Press at a Pyongyang hotel where the North Korean government allowed him to call his family. He said he was digging in fields eight hours a day and being kept in isolation.\n\n___\n\nKENNETH BAE\n\nBae, from Lynnwood, Washington, was detained in November 2012 while leading a tour group in North Korea. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for \u201chostile acts\u201d after being accused of smuggling in inflammatory literature and trying to establish a base for anti-government activities at a border city hotel.\n\nWhile in detention, he told a pro-North Korea newspaper based in Japan that he felt abandoned. His family said he suffered from chronic health issues, including back pain, diabetes, an enlarged heart and liver problems.\n\nBae went home in November 2014 after a secret mission by the U.S. intelligence chief at the time, James Clapper, secured his release, as well as that of Miller. A month earlier, North Korea released another U.S. citizen, Jeffrey Fowle, after detaining him for six months for leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the city of Chongjin.\n\nNorth Korea officially guarantees freedom of religion, but analysts and defectors describe the country as militantly anti-religious. The distribution of Bibles and secret prayer services can mean imprisonment or execution, defectors say.\n\nIn 2009, American missionary Robert Park walked into North Korea with a Bible in his hand to draw attention to North Korea\u2019s human rights abuses and to call for the resignation of then leader Kim Jong Il. Park, who was deported from the country in February 2010, has said he was tortured by interrogators.\n\n___\n\nCHARLES JENKINS\n\nCharles Jenkins of North Carolina was one of a handful of U.S. soldiers who fled to North Korea during the Cold War and later appeared in North Korean propaganda films.\n\nJenkins deserted his army post in South Korea in 1965 and fled across the DMZ. In 1980, he married 21-year-old Hitomi Soga, a Japanese nursing student who had been abducted by North Korean agents in 1978.\n\nSoga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002. That was two years before Jenkins was allowed to leave North Korea for Japan, where he surrendered to U.S. military authorities to faced charges that he abandoned his unit and defected to North Korea. He died in Japan in 2017.\n\n__\n\nEVAN HUNZIKER\n\nEvan Hunziker had reportedly been drinking with a friend in 1996 when he decided to swim naked across the Yalu River between China and North Korea. Hunziker, who was released after three months, had drug, alcohol and legal problems. He was later found dead in Washington state in what was ruled a suicide.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

At far left is White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. (Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration denied on Saturday that it had reached a final determination in the death of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAfter President Donald Trump called his CIA chief and top diplomat from Air Force One as he flew to survey wildfire damage in California, the State Department released a statement saying \u201crecent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate.\u201d\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies have concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey, according to a U.S. official familiar with the assessment. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity Friday. The conclusion was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nThe Saudi government has denied the claim.\n\nDepartment spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in the statement Saturday that the government was \u201cdetermined to hold all those responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable\u201d and that \u201cthere remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder.\u201d\n\nShe said the department \u201cwill continue to seek all relevant facts\u201d and consult with Congress and other nations \u201cto hold accountable those involved in the killing.\u201d\n\nTrump spoke earlier with CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from Air Force One, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. She provided no details but said the president has confidence in the CIA.\n\nTrump told reporters before he left the White House for California that, when it came to the crown prince, \u201cas of this moment we were told that he did not play a role. We\u2019re going to have to find out what they have to say.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the president spoke of Saudi Arabia as \u201ca truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to take a lot of things into consideration\u201d when deciding what measures to take against the kingdom, he said.\n\nThe State Department statement noted the administration\u2019s recent actions against a number of Saudis, but also cited the need to maintain \u201cthe important strategic relationship\u201d between the two allies.\n\nThe intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion will bolster efforts in Congress to further punish the close U.S. ally for the killing. The administration this past week penalized 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing, but American lawmakers have called on the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other harsher punitive measures.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s top diplomat has said the crown prince had \u201cabsolutely\u201d nothing to do with the killing.\n\nVice President Mike Pence told reporters traveling with him at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Papua New Guinea that he could not comment on \u201cclassified information.\u201d He said Saturday \u201cthe murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity. It was also an affront to a free and independent press, and the United States is determined to hold all of those accountable who are responsible for that murder.\u201d\n\nThe United States will \u201cfollow the facts,\u201d Pence said, while trying to find a way of preserving a \u201cstrong and historic partnership\u201d with Saudi Arabia.\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States, was a columnist for the Post and often criticized the royal family. He was killed Oct. 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish and Saudi authorities say he was killed inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom after he went there to get marriage documents.\n\nThis past week, U.S. intelligence officials briefed members of the Senate and House intelligence committees, and the Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the killing.\n\nAmong those targeted for sanctions were Mohammed al-Otaibi, the diplomat in charge of the consulate, and Maher Mutreb, who was part of the crown prince\u2019s entourage on trips abroad.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets the 17 may have in the U.S. and prohibit any Americans from doing business with them.\n\nAlso this past week, the top prosecutor in Saudi Arabia announced he will seek the death penalty against five men suspected in the killing. The prosecutor\u2019s announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi\u2019s death and distance the killers and their operation from the kingdom\u2019s leadership, primarily the crown prince.\n\nTrump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \u201cthe cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\u201d\n\nBut he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Bangladesh, which hosts 1.1 million Rohingya refugees, voted in favor.\n\nThe resolution expresses deep concern that violence by Myanmar\u2019s military against the Rohingya has forced over 723,000 people to flee to Bangladesh since August 2017.\n\nIt urgently calls on Myanmar\u2019s government to end discrimination and provide a path to citizenship for the embattled minority.\n\nBuddhist-majority Myanmar has long considered the Rohingya to be \u201cBengalis\u201d from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations.

The latest results mark a departure from where the race stood Nov. 8, when McAdams was ahead by 6,700 votes. Utah law allows candidates to request a recount when the margin of victory is 0.25 percentage point or less.\n\nThe race is one of a handful across the country that have yet to be called more than a week after Election Day. Voting by mail is popular in Utah, and county clerks have until Nov. 20 to finish counting ballots.\n\nLove filed a lawsuit Wednesday to stop the remaining votes in Salt Lake County from being counted until her campaign was allowed to challenge whether signatures on ballot envelopes matched those on file, a move that McAdams\u2019s campaign opposed.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s court hearing, Love\u2019s attorney argued that Salt Lake County election officials should create a process by which campaigns can challenge alleged signature discrepancies, according to the Deseret News.\n\nMcAdams\u2019s campaign filed a motion to intervene, questioning the timing of the move and contending that it would lead to different treatment for voters in different counties. The campaign also accused Love of seeking to dilute McAdams\u2019s share of the vote.

The Security Council said late Thursday that eight peacekeepers were killed.\n\nLacroix said the U.N. and Congolese troops faced two separate attacks by ADF fighters near the regional capital, Beni, which is the largest city affected by the current Ebola outbreak and the center of efforts to fight it.\n\n\u201cThey returned fire. They repelled the first attack successfully,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then the armed group reorganized and in the second attack, unfortunately our peacekeepers appear to have been killed and injured.\u201d\n\nLacroix said U.N. and Congolese forces captured an ADF base that was used to attack and threaten Beni.\n\nThe U.N. envoy for Congo, Leila Zerrougui, said six ADF combatants were arrested.\n\nShe said the U.N. and the Congolese army decided to launch the operation near Beni, where ADF and Mai-Mai rebel groups are especially active, to secure the area to allow medical and humanitarian teams to fight the Ebola outbreak.

A military campaign there forced them to relocate to eastern Congo.\n\nZerrougui estimated the ADF had about 500 fighters who have integrated in the area, married Congolese and engaged in illegal mining.\n\n\u201cThey consider this is their land and it was given to them\u201d by Congo\u2019s late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, she said.

Dwyer, urging a judge to keep the unrelated matter sealed, wrote that \u201cdue to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged.\u201d Later, Dwyer wrote that the charges would \u201cneed to remain sealed until Assange is arrested.\u201d\n\nPeople familiar with the matter told The Washington Post that while the filing was in error \u2014 the case was not high profile and had nothing to do with Assange \u2014 the information it contained was correct: Assange had been charged.\n\nJoshua Stueve, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Eastern District of Virginia, said: \u201cThe court filing was made in error. That was not the intended name for this filing.\u201d Officials otherwise declined to comment on the matter.\n\nOn Friday, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press asked a judge to unseal the records about Assange\u2019s case, saying the secrecy surrounding the matter was \u201canathema to our open system of justice.\u201d\n\nAssange has long been of interest to federal investigators in connection with a wide range of conduct. Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia, where the errant filing was made, had been examining the WikiLeaks organization for its 2010 publication of diplomatic cables and military documents.\n\nJustice Department officials in the Obama administration essentially concluded that WikiLeaks was a publisher, and that bringing charges against members of the group might prompt First Amendment challenges or set a dangerous precedent that could invite future prosecutions of traditional news organizations.\n\nThose officials, though, left the investigation open. In the Trump administration, prosecutors had been urged to take a hard look at whether charges could be filed.\n\n[Justice Dept. debating charges against WikiLeaks members in revelations of diplomatic, CIA materials]\n\nWikiLeaks also had come under scrutiny for publishing sensitive CIA cyber-tools in a 2017 leak the group dubbed \u201cVault 7.\u201d And special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has been exploring the organization\u2019s role in the publication of emails from the Democratic National Committee and the account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s then-campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.\n\nOfficials have alleged that the emails were hacked by Russian spies and transferred to WikiLeaks.\n\nIt is not clear to which of those matters the charges against Assange relate. Jennifer Robinson, Assange\u2019s lawyer in London, said Friday that the news was \u201cconfirmation of what we\u2019ve been concerned about since 2010, that the United States would seek to prosecute Julian Assange for publishing truthful information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis sets a dangerous and chilling precedent for all of the media both in the United States and elsewhere,\u201d she said.\n\nProsecutors in Assange\u2019s case had contemplated bringing charges under the Espionage Act, among other statutes. Floyd Abrams, an expert in First Amendment law, said the 101-year-old act has long been viewed by press advocates as a \u201cperpetually loaded gun that could too easily be aimed at the press, with ultimately Supreme Court interpretation unpredictable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it violated the Espionage Act for WikiLeaks to gather information from sources not permitted to release it and then publish it, then what American newspaper could be free from risk?\u201d said Abrams, who practices at Cahill Gordon & Reindel in New York.\n\nIt is possible that investigators have gathered evidence that Assange did not act as a mere publisher \u2014 but instead actively helped steal information or worked as an agent of a foreign government, legal analysts said. That might distinguish his case in a way that makes it more palatable for prosecutors to pursue, the analysts said.\n\n\u201cI think the big question now is, did the Justice Department find new evidence that would allow them to charge him with some crime, such as conspiracy to hack into computers or some other crime other than just publication, or does the new administration take a different view on whether he can be charged for just publishing classified documents?\u201d said Matthew Miller, a Justice Department spokesman during the Obama administration.\n\nThe Justice Department under President Barack Obama was not shy about ferreting out leaks. While Obama was in office, prosecutors brought nine leak cases, more than during all previous administrations combined.\n\nOver time, though, the department took a softer attitude toward such matters. In 2014, then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said that as long as he was heading the Justice Department, \u201cno reporter is going to go to jail for doing his or her job.\u201d\n\nAt President Trump\u2019s direction, Sessions restored some of the vigor. The former attorney general proudly touted the number of cases the department was investigating.\n\n[Justice Dept. considered relationship between reporter and source before secretly seeking records]\n\nBarak Cohen, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department\u2019s public-integrity section, said prosecutors generally have to clear higher hurdles when it comes to charging reporters or issuing subpoenas for their records. Cohen, who was involved in the prosecution of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling on charges that he leaked classified material to a New York Times reporter, said prosecutors will probably examine to what extent Assange was acting as a journalist to determine if he should be given special consideration.\n\n\u201cThe extent to which he is curating the news, or the information that he circulates, has a strong impact on whether or not you consider him a publisher,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nSince June 2012, Assange has been living in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London. He sought asylum there when he was facing possible extradition to Sweden in a sex crimes case, arguing that the case was a pretext for what he predicted would be his arrest and extradition to the United States.\n\nThe sex case has since been dropped, but if he left, Assange would still probably be taken into custody for skipping bail. He has faced increasing restrictions on his communications and speech, and people close to him say they suspect that Ecuador has been under considerable pressure from the United States to end his asylum.\n\nIf taken into custody, Assange would be able to fight his extradition \u2014 a process that in Britain can take years. A spokesman for Britain\u2019s Home Office would not say whether Washington has already applied to bring Assange to the United States.\n\nKarla Adam and Devlin Barrett contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Key facts about APEC host Papua New Guinea - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Key facts about APEC host Papua New Guinea Washington Post PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea \u2014 Papua New Guinea hosts leaders from Pacific Rim countries, including the United States, Russia and China, this weekend in a coming-out party for the ju\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/key-facts-about-apec-host-papua-new-guinea/2018/11/16/6da12bfa-ea00-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T00:37:06Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "A performer in traditional clothing and makeup waits for the start of a welcome ceremony for Chinese President Xi Jinping in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, Friday, Nov. 16, 2018.

(Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press)\n\nPORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea \u2014 Papua New Guinea hosts leaders from Pacific Rim countries, including the United States, Russia and China, this weekend in a coming-out party for the jungle-clad nation that is regarded as one of the world\u2019s last frontiers for trade and investment.\n\nThe largely undeveloped South Pacific nation of more than 8 million mostly subsistence farmers hopes the rare world attention generated by its hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Economic Cooperation meetings will highlight its potential and draw more investors and aid. But its deeply entrenched troubles, including widespread poverty, corruption and lawlessness, also stand to be scrutinized.\n\n___\n\nTONGUE TWISTER\n\nMore than 1,000 tribes with over 800 different languages are scattered across 22 provinces, including in its capital Port Moresby and faraway mountain hinterlands and islands. Inadequate infrastructure and potholed roads, however, have kept apart diverse tribal groups more than the language barrier. English, which is widely spoken, and a creole English called Tok Pisin, have helped bridge the divide. The isolation has helped preserve ancient traditions in the most remote villages, where belief in black magic and sorcery has persisted in an era of great technological advances.\n\n___\n\nAPEC-CHALLENGED\n\nThe APEC host is the most challenged on many counts in the free-trade club, which includes the world\u2019s leading economic heavyweights \u2014 the United States, China and Japan \u2014 and accounts for 60 percent of global gross domestic product and nearly half of world trade. Although it\u2019s resource rich, Papua New Guinea is the 21-member bloc\u2019s most impoverished and youngest member. It declared independence from its Australian colonizer only in 1975. It was helped by Australia, which remains its biggest aid provider, along with China, the United States and New Zealand to deal with the logistical challenges of hosting a year of APEC meetings, including construction of the main venue.\n\nWhen it joined APEC in 1993, Papua New Guinea had to court the backing of Asian neighbors to gain entry into the prestigious bloc of Pacific Rim nations and explain that it\u2019s located in the region, its former prime minister, Julius Chan, said. \u201cFirst they don\u2019t think that PNG was an Asian country,\u201d Chan told the Nation newspaper. \u201cI insisted that we are right in the center of the Asia and the Pacific.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLAW AND ORDER\n\nCrime and violence in Papua New Guinea are notoriously prevalent based on anecdotal accounts and media reports, and are a national concern. Statistics are at best spotty but a World Bank study several years ago reported that crime levels have stayed consistently high for more than a decade, with robbery and assault the most common. Family and sexual violence were highly prevalent too and homicide rate in at least two areas, including the capital, is among the highest in the world.\n\nConcern over lawlessness has made hosting 20 world leaders and more than 12,000 APEC delegates Papua New Guinea\u2019s biggest security worry. \u201cIt is risky for expatriates to travel alone at any time of the day or night,\u201d a government do\u2019s and don\u2019ts primer warned foreign delegates, some of whom were billeted in luxury cruise ships along with visiting journalists because there weren\u2019t enough hotels in Port Moresby.\n\nAustralia, the U.S. and New Zealand provided armed personnel, navy ships, jets and surveillance helicopters to help augment security. Still, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence decided to spend nights in Cairns city in neighboring Australia while attending the meetings on behalf of President Donald Trump, who decided not to go.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 Many of the nearly 3,000 Central American migrants who have reached the Mexican border with California via caravan said Saturday they do not feel welcome in the city of Tijuana, where hundreds more migrants are headed after more than a month on the road.\n\nThe vast majority were camped at an outdoor sports complex, sleeping on a dirt baseball field and under bleachers with a view of the steel walls topped by barbed wire at the newly reinforced U.S.-Mexico border. The city opened the complex after other shelters were filled to capacity. Church groups provided portable showers, bathrooms and sinks. The federal government estimates the migrant crowd in Tijuana could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants\u2019 arrival an \u201cavalanche\u201d that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. U.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana\u2019s main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nWhile many in Tijuana are sympathetic to the migrants\u2019 plight and trying to assist, some locals have shouted insults, hurled rocks and even thrown punches at the migrants.\n\nIt\u2019s a stark contrast to the many Mexican communities that welcomed the caravan with signs, music and donations of clothing after it entered Mexico nearly a month ago. Countless residents of rural areas pressed fruit and bags of water into the migrants\u2019 hands as they passed through southern Mexico, wishing them safe journeys.\n\nAlden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, visited the outdoor sports complex Saturday. Rivera expects the migrants will need to be sheltered for eight months or more, and said he is working with Mexico to get more funds to feed and care for them. He expects the migrant numbers in Tijuana to reach 3,400 over the weekend, with another 1,200 migrants having made it to Mexicali, another border city a few hours to the east of Tijuana. An additional 1,500 migrants plan to reach the U.S. border region next week.\n\nRivera said 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision.\n\n\u201cWe want them to return to Honduras,\u201d Rivera said, adding that each migrant must weigh whether to go home, appeal for asylum in Mexico or wait in line to apply for asylum in the U.S.\n\nThe Mexican Interior Ministry said Friday that 2,697 Central American migrants have requested asylum in Mexico under a program that the country launched on Oct. 26 to more quickly get them credentials needed to live, work and study in southern Mexico.\n\nIvis Mu\u00f1oz, 26, has considered returning to Honduras. The coffee farmer called his father in Atima, Honduras, on Saturday to consult on his next move a few days after being attacked on a beach by locals in Tijuana. His father told him to stick it out.\n\nMunoz has a bullet in his leg. A gang member shot him a year ago in Honduras and threatened to kill him if he sees him again. Munoz said he found out later his girlfriend had been cheating on him with the gang member.\n\nHe\u2019s afraid to go home, but he feels unwelcome in Tijuana.\n\nMunoz was asleep on a beach in Tijuana with about two dozen other migrants when rocks came raining down on them around 2 a.m. Wednesday. He heard a man shout in the darkness: \u201cWe don\u2019t want you here! Go back to your country!\u201d Munoz and the others got up and ran for cover, heading toward the residential streets nearby. As the sun rose, they hitched a ride on a passing truck to Tijuana\u2019s downtown. Now he is staying at the sports complex.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Munoz. He fears the U.S. won\u2019t grant him asylum, and that he\u2019ll get deported if he tries to cross into the country without authorization.\n\nCarlos Padilla, 57, a migrant from Progreso, Honduras, said a Tijuana resident shouted \u201cmigrants are pigs\u201d as he passed on the street recently. He did not respond. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here to cause problems, we came here with love and with the intention to ask for asylum,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cBut they treat us like animals here.\u201d\n\nPadilla said he will likely return to Honduras if the U.S. rejects his asylum request.\n\nThe migrants\u2019 expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million to handle the influx.\n\nTijuana officials said they converted the municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city\u2019s privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000; as of Friday night there were 2,397 migrants there.\n\nSome business owners near the shelter complained on Saturday of migrants panhandling and stealing.\n\nFrancisco Lopez, 50, owns a furniture store nearby. He said a group of migrants took food from a small grocery a few doors down, and he worries that crime in the area will rise the longer the migrants stay at the shelter.\n\nOther neighbors expressed empathy.\n\n\u201cThese poor people have left their country and they\u2019re in an unfamiliar place,\u201d said Maria de Jesus Izarraga, 68, who lives two blocks from complex.\n\nAs Izarraga spoke from her home\u2019s front door, a man interrupted to ask for money to buy a plate of beans. He said he came with the caravan and had blisters on his feet. She gave him some pesos, and continued speaking: \u201cI hope this all works out in the best possible way.\u201d\n\nOutside the complex, lines of migrants snaked along the street to receive donations of clothes and coolers full of bottled water being dropped off by charity groups and others looking to help the migrants.\n\nFelipe Garza, 55, acknowledged that many in his hometown don\u2019t want to help as he and other volunteers from his church handed migrants coffee and rolls at the impromptu municipal shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable to receive such a big multitude of people, but it\u2019s a reality that we have to deal with,\u201d he said.\n\nGarza surmised that if the Central Americans behave, Tijuana will embrace them just as it did thousands of Haitians in 2016. Those Haitians have since opened restaurants, hair salons and enrolled in local universities.\n\nPolice officer Victor Coronel agrees but wonders how much more the city can take. \u201cThe only thing we can do is hope that President (Donald) Trump opens his heart a little,\u201d said Coronel.\n\nTrump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in last week\u2019s elections, took to Twitter on Friday to aim new criticism at the migrants.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting U.S.A. asylum because they are fearful of being in their country \u2014 yet they are proudly waving ... their country\u2019s flag. Can this be possible? Yes, because it is all a BIG CON, and the American taxpayer is paying for it,\u201d Trump said in a pair of tweets.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
