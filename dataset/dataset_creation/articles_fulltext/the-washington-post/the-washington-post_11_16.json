Mauritania is another team closing in on a maiden appearance at a tournament expanded from 16 to 24 teams for the first time next year. Mauritania could make sure with a win over Botswana on Saturday.\n\n\u2018SALAH SUPERMAN\u2019\n\nSalah has been Egypt\u2019s superman recently, scoring the goal that took the Pharaohs to the World Cup in Russia, and now collecting four goals in the four games he\u2019s played in Egypt\u2019s successful African Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nHis winner against Tunisia at home in Alexandria prompted the Arabic television commentator, breaking momentarily into English, to declare: \u201cYes you can, yes you can, Salah superman!\u201d Salah celebrated by removing his shirt and whirling it around with his left hand before being mobbed by teammates behind Tunisia\u2019s goal.\n\nHis latest strike gave Egypt victory at the end of a seesaw game, where Egypt trailed to an early Naim Sliti goal, led 2-1, and then was pegged back by a second from Sliti for 2-2.\n\nIt also ended Tunisia\u2019s winning run in qualifying and put Egypt level with the Tunisians at the top of the group with one game to play.\n\nMOROCCO 2, CAMEROON 0\n\nMorocco is more or less there after a 2-0 win over Cameroon, the reigning African champion which is guaranteed a place at the African Cup as the host. Cameroon is playing in the qualifiers for match practice and may need it after struggling this year under new coach Clarence Seedorf. Hakim Ziyech scored both goals for Morocco, which will qualify if Malawi doesn\u2019t beat Comoros on Saturday. Even if Malawi does win that game, Morocco needs just a draw in its last game in Malawi to qualify. Even a narrow loss would be good enough.\n\nBURUNDI ONE OF THE BIG SURPRISES\n\nBurundi surprisingly leads its group after a hat trick by striker Abdul Razak helped it beat struggling South Sudan 5-2. That could change when Gabon hosts Mali on Saturday but Burundi still has an excellent chance to make the continental championship for the first time with a home game against Gabon in the decisive final round in March.\n\nThat would be the next big surprise after Madagascar, home to the president of the African soccer confederation, has had little recent success.\n\nMauritania may be the biggest surprise, a country in northwest Africa which is almost completely covered by the Sahara desert and which secured its first international win 17 years after its first game. But Mauritania has won three out of four games in this qualifying campaign to leave it needing one more victory at home to Botswana on Saturday to make sure of one of the two qualification places from the group.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Whitaker as acting attorney general asked the Supreme Court on Friday to step in and declare that someone else should serve in the role.\n\nThe filing by lawyer Thomas C. Goldstein, who earlier this week filed a motion in federal court on behalf of Maryland\u2019s attorney general challenging Whitaker\u2019s appointment, is a novel attempt to undo President Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Justice Department after Jeff Sessions was forced out as attorney general on Nov. 7.\n\nWhitaker was serving as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, and Goldstein and other critics argue it is illegal for a government official to run the agency \u2014 even temporarily \u2014 if he is not Senate-confirmed.\n\nIt is unclear when the Supreme Court could consider Goldstein\u2019s motion.\n\n[Maryland challenges legality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment as acting U.S. attorney general]\n\nConcerns about Whitaker\u2019s appointment stem partly from unanswered questions about what, if anything, the new acting attorney general may do to try to steer the ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, the investigation is examining whether Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with Moscow to influence the election\u2019s outcome. On Thursday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said that Whitaker told him he has no intention of recusing from the Russia probe, or shuttering it.\n\nGoldstein has asked the Supreme Court to clear up any confusion about whether Whitaker or Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein has the legal authority to fill the job.\n\n\u201cThis is the extraordinary case in which the identity of the successor is both contested and has important implications for the administration of justice nationally,\u201d the filing argues. \u201cThis motion seeks to resolve the dispute.\u201d\n\nGoldstein said legal challenges to Whitaker\u2019s appointment will keep popping up in various court cases around the country, and the Supreme Court should weigh in to settle the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is turning into a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cThese things are going to start boiling up.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately comment on Goldstein\u2019s filing.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials there issued a legal analysis concluding that a senior government worker like Whitaker can serve as the acting attorney general for up to seven months, or longer if a nomination for a permanent successor is sent to the Senate.\n\n[Justice Dept. defends Whitaker appointment]\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal guidance to the federal government, said in its 20-page memo that past practice, court rulings and legal analysis show the Whitaker appointment is legal and expressly authorized by the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act.\n\nThe memo also notes that before Sessions was forced out, the White House had sought advice from the OLC and was told that Whitaker could be appointed.\n\n\u201cAs all three branches of government have long recognized, the president may designate an acting official to perform the duties of a vacant principal office, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe memo notes that Trump has done so six times, while President Barack Obama did it twice and President George W. Bush did it once.\n\nThe legal opinion also concludes that even if Trump had fired Sessions, he could have replaced him with a non-Senate-confirmed government employee for a period of up to seven months, or more if a nomination was pending. By that reasoning, the president has the power to remove Cabinet-level officials at will and put their replacements in charge of major government branches for half a year or more.\n\nThe OLC\u2019s legal analysis found 160 such instances \u2014 all of them occurring before 1860 \u2014 in which a non-Senate-confirmed official became the acting head of an agency."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Michael Brice-Saddler", "title": "House Ethics Committee sanctions two members over sexual harassment allegations", "description": "The panel formally sanctioned Democratic Rep.

(Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nThe House Ethics Committee formally sanctioned Democratic Rep. Ruben Kihuen (Nev.) and Republican Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.) for offenses related to sexual harassment.\n\nKihuen, whose term is up this year, was accused by three women of improper touching, though he denied the charges. Meadows was sanctioned for not taking proper action against a chief of staff who was accused of sexual harassment by six women, and for continuing to pay him after he\u2019d stopped working for Meadows.\n\nAn investigation into Kihuen, once considered a rising Democratic star in Nevada politics, began in December after allegations arose that he\u2019d sexually harassed an employee while campaigning for Congress in 2016 and sexually harassed a lobbyist during his time as a state legislator. A BuzzFeed News report published in December alleged that he made repeated, unrequited requests for dates from his then-campaign finance director and touched her thighs twice without consent.\n\nThe report prompted calls for Kihuen\u2019s resignation from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Kihuen said at the time that he would not resign and welcomed an ethics investigation to clear his name. He later announced, however, that he would leave Congress at the end of his first term and not seek reelection.\n\n\u201cI want to state clearly again that I deny the allegations in question,\u201d Kihuen said in a December statement. \u201cHowever, the allegations that have surfaced would be a distraction from a fair and thorough discussion of the issues in a reelection campaign. Therefore, it is in the best interests of my family and my constituents to complete my term in Congress and not seek reelection.\"\n\nThe House Ethics Committee report, published Friday, says the committee found that Kihuen made \u201cpersistent and unwanted advances towards women who were required to interact with him as part of their professional responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThree women, who testified before a subcommittee as a part of the investigation, reported that Kihuen made \u201cunwanted physical and verbal advances towards them between 2013 and 2017,\u201d according to the report. A Washington employee, whose firm worked with Kihuen\u2019s reelection campaign in 2017, testified that he\u2019d touched her lower back and shoulders, repeatedly kissed her on the cheek and suggested that he could \u201chelp her career if she was willing to entertain his romantic interests.\u201d\n\nA 2016 congressional campaign staffer for Kihuen and a Nevada lobbyist also testified with similar allegations. The lobbyist said that he\u2019d slid his hand under her dress, grabbed her buttocks and asked her to sit on his lap, according to the report.\n\nAlthough Kihuen generally denied the allegations, the report notes that \u201ceach of the complainant\u2019s allegations were supported by documentary evidence and some of the alleged incidents were corroborated by third-party witnesses.\u201d The report also notes that at least two outside entities were privy to the campaign staffer\u2019s and the D.C. employee\u2019s allegations and approached Kihuen, and his campaign, about the allegations in 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn a Friday statement, Kihuen apologized for his actions, though he said he does not agree with aspects of the report:\n\n\u201cAfter much reflection and introspection, I recognize that regardless of the fact that I never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable or disrespected, what matters is how my actions were perceived by the women who came forward. It saddens me greatly to think I made any woman feel that way due to my own immaturity and overconfidence. I extend my sincere apologies to each of these women. Though I do not agree with aspects of the Report, I am thankful the Committee afforded everyone an opportunity to be heard and appreciate the Committee\u2019s acknowledgment that I fully cooperated with the investigation.\u201d\n\nFor Meadows, the sanctions come after a congressional ethics panel in 2016 said that there is \u201csubstantial reason to believe\u201d that he broke House rules by continuing to pay his chief of staff, Kenneth West, after West was no longer an employee of the office.\n\nWest is a former GOP rival who Meadows hired as his chief of staff when he joined Congress in 2013. In late 2014, reports began to surface from female staffers in Meadows\u2019s office that West\u2019s behavior was \u201cmaking them uncomfortable.\u201d Meadows said he would make sure that West was no longer present around the office, but it was unclear in the ensuing months whether West was still employed.\n\nAccording to the Ethics Committee\u2019s report, numerous female members of Meadows\u2019s staff made complaints about West\u2019s behavior. Six female employees told the committee they experienced unwanted touching from West, and others reported inappropriate staring and said he made unsolicited comments about their appearance.\n\nMeadows apparently put \u201cremedial\u201d measures in place to separate West from his female staff, which were not effective and \u201crisk[ed] unequal treatment of employees based solely on sex,\u201d the committee found. Meadows kept West as his chief of staff until April 2015, according to the report.\n\nFriday\u2019s report said that Meadows\u2019s \u201cfailure to take prompt and decisive action to deal with the alleged sexual harassment in his congressional office was troubling to the Committee.\u201d Moreover, the committee found, Meadows violated House rules by failing to take appropriate steps to \u201censure that his House office was free from discrimination and any perception of discrimination.\u201d\n\nIn November 2015, Meadows said in a letter to the Office of Congressional Ethics that he had terminated West\u2019s employment in May and that he had offered to pay him as an adviser for the sake of a \u201csmooth transition\u201d through August 2015, likening it to \u201cseverance pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Committee acknowledges that there was little and inconsistent guidance on severance payments available to the House community at the time Representative Meadows paid severance to Mr. West. That said, after Mr. West ended his duties for the congressional office, Representative Meadows continued to pay his salary for two months,\u201d the report reads. \u201cRepresentative Meadows sought no guidance on whether such payments were permissible and did not obtain anything of discernible value in exchange for those official funds, such as a release of legal claims. Accordingly, the Committee found that Representative Meadows\u2019 payment of severance to Mr. West ran afoul of clause 8.\u201d\n\nAccording to Friday\u2019s report, the committee found that there was \u201csubstantial reason to believe that Representative Meadows retained an employee who did not perform duties commensurate with the compensation the employee received,\u201d a violation of House rules and standards of conduct.\n\nMeadows will be required to reimburse the U.S. Treasury for the $40,625.02 \u201coverpayment\u201d of West.\n\nBoth Kihuen and Meadows were reproved by the committee, which Politico notes is the lowest form of punishment it can issue.\n\nIn a statement published by Politico, Meadows indicated that he was \u201cthankful\u201d that the review had concluded.\n\n\u201cThree years ago I asked the Committee on Ethics to review the matter surrounding the alleged conduct of my former chief of staff, Mr. West, and I\u2019m thankful their review has now concluded,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cI appreciate the Committee\u2019s acknowledgment of the immediate, appropriate, and good faith steps I did take after learning of my staff\u2019s concerns \u2014 including immediately separating the chief from the accusers so they never had to interact with him personally during the independent investigation.\"\n\nAn aide told Politico that Meadows \u201cwill pay back the severance in full.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump says he\u2019s finished writing answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller\n\nSupreme Court will weigh in on lawsuit over census citizenship question\n\nJudge hands CNN a victory in its bid to restore Jim Acosta\u2019s White House press pass\n\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams admits defeat in contentious Georgia governor\u2019s race"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "George Will", "title": "Want to topple Trump?

The Democratic Party is manacled to an overcaffeinated base that believes that deft government can deliver parity of status to everyone while micromanaging the economy\u2019s health-care sector, which is larger than all but three foreign nations\u2019 economies. Inconveniently, the party must appeal to voters who, living in dread of their next interaction with the Department of Motor Vehicles, yearn only for governmental adequacy.\n\nWhich is why John Delaney, who is ending a three-term tenure as a Democratic congressman from Maryland, is seeking his party\u2019s presidential nomination. His quest will test whether Democrats\u2019 detestation of President Trump is stronger than their enthusiasm for identity politics: A white male businessperson, Delaney comes to bat with three strikes against him.\n\nSuppose, however, Democrats are more interested in scrubbing the current presidential stain from public life than they are in virtue-signaling and colonizing the far shores of leftwingery. Delaney is much more than an example of the If-Trump-Can-Be-Elected-So-Can-My-Cocker-Spaniel response to 2016.\n\nHis grandparents, he says, \u201cmade pencils and worked the docks.\u201d He did not become wealthy, as today\u2019s businessperson-turned-president did, through a father\u2019s largesse supplemented by tax chicanery. Neither of Delaney\u2019s parents went to college. His father was a 60-year member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. An IBEW scholarship, and support from the American Legion, VFW and Lions Club, helped Delaney through Columbia University. After Georgetown Law School, where he met his wife, he founded a financial company and became the youngest-ever chief executive on the New York Stock Exchange. His second company invests in small and midsize companies. In 2017, Fortune magazine included him among the \u201cWorld\u2019s 50 Greatest Leaders.\u201d\n\nSolidly built and impeccably tailored, Delaney, 55, is a Democrat who believes in what he has lived: upward mobility, with assistance. He recognizes the obvious, that globalization has been \u201cextraordinarily positive\u201d for billions more people than it has injured, but its American casualties are real and deserve government help. He speaks with the calm confidence of one who understands, as the man he hopes to displace does not, that the lungs are not the seat of wisdom. He checks various boxes that might mollify all but the most fastidious progressives: He likes early-childhood education, a carbon tax, a $15 minimum wage and extending the Social Security tax to higher incomes. He dislikes the National Rifle Association, the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, high interest rates on student loans and \u201coutrageous\u201d drug prices. He would achieve \u201cuniversal\u201d health care by offering Medicaid for all, and for those who choose to opt for private programs, as he thinks most people would, there would be federal subsidies for those who need them.\n\nHe says \u201cthe screaming top headline\u201d from the midterm elections was that moderate Democrats won. Few not occupying safe seats won while hollering \u201cSingle-payer health care!\u201d and \u201cAbolish ICE!\u201d and \u201cImpeachment!\u201d\n\nIt is Delaney\u2019s persona \u2014 think of a Joe Biden 20 years younger and half as prolix \u2014 that will distinguish him and seem either pleasingly adult or insufficiently carbonated when the prancing ponies from the U.S. Senate come cantering into Iowa. If the nomination scramble is a decibel competition, Delaney will lose \u2014 and the winning Democrat probably will lose in the November 2020 rendezvous with him who specializes in loud.\n\nDelaney illustrates the reason for tolerating what Iowa considers a Mandate of Heaven \u2014 its entitlement to begin the nomination process. Iowans are so thin on the ground that relentless retail politicking can give a dark-horse candidate a fighting chance against the ponies who, being senators and hence barely employed, have ample time to flit around the country raising money and their pretty profiles before coming to where the tall corn grows. Delaney, who is not neglecting New Hampshire, has been tilling Iowa\u2019s political soil as an announced candidate for more than 475 days and long since exceeded 50 percent name recognition among Democratic Iowans. He has visited all 99 counties with more than 440 days remaining before the 2020 caucuses.\n\nIn the 10 presidential cycles since Jimmy Carter\u2019s 1976 win in Iowa made the caucuses important, six Democrats have won competitive caucuses and then their party\u2019s nomination: President Carter (defeating Ted Kennedy) in 1980, Walter Mondale in 1984, Al Gore in 2000, John F. Kerry in 2004, Barack Obama in 2008, Hillary Clinton in 2016. Delaney in 2020? Democrats could do much worse. They generally do, and probably will. As in 2016, Trump is counting on it.\n\nRead more from George F.

Edwards, a Democrat, represented Maryland\u2019s 4th District in the U.S. House from 2008 to 2017.\n\nDear newly elected House Democrats,\n\nCongratulations on your historic victory. I hope you take time to reflect on how and why you won. But not too much time. Your first big decision awaits you \u2014 your choice for speaker of the House.\n\nI remember when I was sent to Congress in a special election in 2008, having beaten an eight-term incumbent for whom then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi had campaigned. I was the progressive champion. I brought to the table a 20-year career as a nonprofit lawyer, advocate for women and progressive philanthropist. I was in no mood to support Pelosi and the \u201ccorporate Democrats\u201d she represented. I was wrong.\n\nAs soon as I was sworn in by the first female speaker, I began to appreciate the power of that role and her understanding of it. Once the election was over, it was over; I was her member. First, she wanted to know my aspirations and how she could help me achieve them.\n\nThen, I watched as she paid close attention to the individual needs of the Democrats, especially those from vulnerable districts. You will need this attention \u2014 you will need Speaker Pelosi to protect you from harmful votes and to advance a legislative agenda with priorities that you can sell back home. And, importantly (until you reform the system), you will need Speaker Pelosi to raise for the 2020 cycle at least the $135.6 million that she raised for this one \u2014 including $129 million that went directly into the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, about half of what the DCCC took in for the 2018 cycle. I know money isn\u2019t everything, but it sure helps to hire a good manager, pay for a strong field program and communicate with your voters. It will help to retain your majority. Others may step forward to say they can do these things as well as Pelosi. Trust me, they cannot.\n\nAs have many of the new members entering the 116th Congress, I promised to deliver on health care. With Democrats controlling the White House, the House and the Senate in 2009, I assumed it would be smooth sailing. It was not; and this is where I get to Pelosi\u2019s battle-tested leadership. I watched as she balanced the measured desires of Barack Obama\u2019s White House with the interests of all the factions within the Democratic caucus. Some of the fiercest opposition to the insurance-based approach of the White House came from the progressive caucus, of which I was a part. We lost then to the White House and to Pelosi, but that\u2019s not the point of this story, and you will get to revisit that decision.\n\nIn those negotiations, I watched Pelosi, the tactician. She held scores of meetings, back-to-back, day into night. She juggled phone calls \u2014 House and Senate leaders, Cabinet secretaries, the president. All to get us to \u201cyes.\u201d She paid the most attention to vulnerable members; Pelosi knew they would pay the highest price for doing the right thing, and they did. When all the men in the room wanted to give up \u2014 after the nose-dive in approval ratings, media vitriol and unrelenting protests \u2014 Pelosi started counting votes and doing the kind of bare-knuckles work that was needed.\n\nLater, as minority leader, she got to \u201cyes\u201d with the Trump White House on a budget deal to prevent a government shutdown and protect Democratic priorities. She held the Democratic caucus together for one vote after another to stand up against House Republicans, including their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, as well as organizing unanimous opposition to the GOP tax plan. You ran on those issues in your elections. Pelosi engaged in strategic coordination with outside groups to hammer home the health-care message to deliver victory on Nov. 6.\n\nI know some of you promised to vote against Pelosi as speaker. I urge the rest of you to think twice before rejecting the most qualified person, at the most important time, for the most important job. There will be plenty of time for a change in leadership to a new generation, at every level; that is inevitable. I urge your leaders, including Pelosi, to use this important time to cultivate new leaders who are prepared to build on her legacy.\n\nYou will have an opportunity to improve the Affordable Care Act, pass an infrastructure bill, manage an inquiry into Russian interference in our elections \u2014 and you will need Pelosi as speaker to get these things done.

A team of 15 Saudi agents flew to Istanbul on government aircraft in October and killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate, where he had gone to pick up documents that he needed for his planned marriage to a Turkish woman.\n\nIn reaching its conclusions, the CIA examined multiple sources of intelligence, including a phone call that the prince\u2019s brother Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, had with Khashoggi, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the intelligence. Khalid told Khashoggi, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post, that he should go to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to retrieve the documents and gave him assurances that it would be safe to do so.\n\nIt is not clear if Khalid knew that Khashoggi would be killed, but he made the call at his brother\u2019s direction, according to the people familiar with the call, which was intercepted by U.S. intelligence.\n\nFatimah Baeshen, a spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, said the ambassador and Khashoggi never discussed \u201canything related to going to Turkey.\u201d She added that the claims in the CIA\u2019s \u201cpurported assessment are false. We have and continue to hear various theories without seeing the primary basis for these speculations.\u201d\n\nThe CIA\u2019s conclusion about Mohammed\u2019s role was also based on the agency\u2019s assessment of the prince as the country\u2019s de facto ruler who oversees even minor affairs in the kingdom. \u201cThe accepted position is that there is no way this happened without him being aware or involved,\u201d said a U.S. official familiar with the CIA\u2019s conclusions.\n\n[Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is \u2018chief of the tribe\u2019 in cowed House of Saud]\n\nThe CIA sees Mohammed as a \u201cgood technocrat,\u201d the U.S. official said, but also as volatile and arrogant, someone who \u201cgoes from zero to 60, doesn\u2019t seem to understand that there are some things you can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nCIA analysts believe he has a firm grip on power and is not in danger of losing his status as heir to the throne despite the Khashoggi scandal. \u201cThe general agreement is that he is likely to survive,\u201d the official said, adding that Mohammed\u2019s role as the future Saudi king is \u201ctaken for granted.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the CIA declined to comment.\n\nOver the past several weeks, the Saudis have offered multiple, contradictory explanations for what happened at the consulate. This week, the Saudi public prosecutor blamed the operation on a rogue band of operatives who were sent to Istanbul to return Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia, in an operation that veered off course when the journalist \u201cwas forcibly restrained and injected with a large amount of a drug resulting in an overdose that led to his death,\u201d according to a report by the prosecutor.\n\nThe prosecutor announced charges against 11 alleged participants and said he would seek the death penalty against five of them.\n\nThe assassination of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Mohammed\u2019s policies, has sparked a foreign policy crisis for the White House and raised questions about the administration\u2019s reliance on Saudi Arabia as a key ally in the Middle East and bulwark against Iran.\n\nPresident Trump has resisted pinning the blame for the killing on Mohammed, who enjoys a close relationship with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Privately, aides said, Trump has been shown evidence of the prince\u2019s involvement but remains skeptical that Mohammed ordered the killing.\n\nThe president has also asked CIA and State Department officials where Khashoggi\u2019s body is and has grown frustrated that they have not been able to provide an answer. The CIA does not know the location of Khashoggi\u2019s remains, according to the people familiar with the agency\u2019s assessment.\n\nAmong the intelligence assembled by the CIA is an audio recording from a listening device that the Turks placed inside the Saudi Consulate, according to the people familiar with the matter. The Turks gave the CIA a copy of that audio, and the agency\u2019s director, Gina Haspel, has listened to it.\n\nThe audio shows that Khashoggi was killed within moments of entering the consulate, according to officials in multiple countries who have listened to it or been briefed on its contents. Khashoggi died in the office of the Saudi consul general, who can be heard expressing his displeasure that Khashoggi\u2019s body now needed to be disposed of and the facility cleaned of any evidence, according to people familiar with the audio recording.\n\n[Woman says she married Khashoggi in ceremony kept secret from his fiancee and some in his family]\n\nThe CIA also examined a call placed from inside the consulate after the killing by an alleged member of the Saudi hit team, Maher Mutreb, a security official who has often been seen at the crown prince\u2019s side and who was photographed entering and leaving the consulate on the day of the killing.\n\nMutreb called Saud al-Qahtani, then one of the top aides to Mohammed, and informed him that the operation had been completed, according to people familiar with the call.\n\nThis week, the Treasury Department sanctioned 17 individuals it said were involved in Khashoggi\u2019s death, including Qahtani, Mutreb and the Saudi consul general in Turkey, Mohammad al-Otaibi.\n\nThe CIA\u2019s assessment of Mohammed\u2019s role in the assassination also tracks with information developed by foreign governments, according to officials in several European capitals who have concluded that the operation was too brazen to have taken place without Mohammed\u2019s direction.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tay\u00adyip Erdogan has said his government has shared the audio with Germany, France, Britain and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn addition to calls and audio recordings, CIA analysts also linked some members of the Saudi hit team directly to Mohammed himself. Some of the 15 members have served on his security team and traveled in the United States during visits by senior Saudi officials, including the crown prince, according to passport records reviewed by The Post.\n\nThe United States had also \u00adobtained intelligence before Khashoggi\u2019s death that indicated he might be in danger. But it wasn\u2019t until after he disappeared on Oct. 2 that U.S. intelligence agencies began searching archives of intercepted communications and discovered material indicating that the Saudi royal family had been seeking to lure Khashoggi back to Riyadh.\n\nTwo U.S. officials said there has been no indication that officials were aware of this intelligence in advance of Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance or had missed any chance to warn him.\n\nKhashoggi \u201cwas not a person of interest\u201d before his disappearance, and the fact that he was residing in Virginia meant that he was regarded as a U.S. person and therefore shielded from U.S. intelligence gathering, one of the officials said.\n\nTrump has told senior White House officials that he wants Mohammed to remain in power because Saudi Arabia helps to check Iran, which the administration considers its top security challenge in the Middle East. He has said that he does not want the controversy over Khashoggi\u2019s death to impede oil production by the kingdom.\n\nOne lingering question is why Mohammed might have decided to kill Khashoggi, who was not agitating for the crown prince\u2019s removal.\n\nA theory the CIA has developed is that Mohammed believed Khashoggi was a dangerous Islamist who was too sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood, according to people familiar with the assessment. Days after Khashoggi disappeared, Mohammed relayed that view in a phone call with Kushner and John Bolton, the national security adviser, who has long opposed the Brotherhood and seen it as a regional security threat.\n\nMohammed\u2019s private condemnation of the slain journalist stood in contrast to his government\u2019s public comments, which mourned Khashoggi\u2019s killing as a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d and a \u201ctragedy.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials are unclear on when or whether the Saudi government will follow through with its threatened executions of the individuals blamed for Khashoggi\u2019s killing. \u201cIt could happen overnight or take 20 years,\u201d the U.S. official said, adding that the treatment of subordinates could erode Mohammed\u2019s standing going forward.\n\nIn killing those who followed his orders, \u201cit\u2019s hard to get the next set [of subordinates] to help,\u201d the official said.\n\nJohn Hudson and Missy Ryan in Washington, Souad Mekhennet in Frankfurt, and Loveday Morris and Kareem Fahim in Istanbul contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/josh.partlow1", "title": "At the U.S. border, migrant caravan will slow to a crawl", "description": "U.S. border guards can process 100 migrants per day, meaning months of waiting in Mexico.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/at-the-us-border-migrant-caravan-will-slow-to-a-crawl/2018/11/16/01374426-e84e-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JEAZjELmoQJUoZD7IBxKEjjkiNU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T2LJ7MXJ3MI6RO63OL637HKP5U.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:07:51Z", "content": "When the Central American caravan finally crosses onto U.S. soil past the fresh coils of barbed wire, through the chain-link door they will begin a closely monitored existence in U.S. custody, with showers every two days and guard checks every 15 minutes.

They will have two hot meals a day, a cold lunch and possibly cereal before bed.\n\nWhat the experience won\u2019t be, for the several thousand migrants who are now pooling up in Tijuana, is fast.\n\n\u201cWe have a process in place,\u201d said Sidney Aki, the San Ysidro port director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \u201cPlease be patient.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a month and some 3,000 miles, the caravan has reached the end of its road. What had been a plodding slog through southern Mexico rapidly accelerated in the past week, as many migrants rode in buses , provided by local governments, along the route from Mexico City north to the border. More than 2,000 people have arrived in Tijuana this week, with another 7,000 not far behind, according to Mexican authorities. That doesn\u2019t include the roughly 3,000 migrants who were already in Tijuana seeking legal entry into the United States.\n\nFor many in the caravan, the next step is to apply for asylum at the San Ysidro border crossing, and what that means is waiting.\n\nDuring one day in May 2016, U.S. border authorities allowed more than 1,000 Haitian asylum seekers into the port of entry. To handle the influx, they converted staff offices into holding cells; employee showers became migrant showers. Overtime pay surged; they were short on food and supplies.\n\n\u201cThe operation got overwhelmed,\u201d said Mariza Marin, a CBP watch commander.\n\nThe lesson for Aki and his subordinates: Never exceed capacity. They say they can process 90 to 100 migrants per day and have a total holding space for about 300 people. Francisco Gomez, a top official in Baja California, the Mexican state which includes Tijuana, estimated that the caravan would be there four months or more.\n\nAt this newly renovated port of entry \u2014 the busiest on the border, Aki said, with some 100,000 legal travelers crossing into the United States each day \u2014 asylum seekers will stay in detention for up to 72 hours before being transferred by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to other facilities for children, adults or families. Waiting for ICE is a major bottleneck, Aki said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking the blame for everything,\u201d Aki said. But until ICE moves migrants out, \u201cwe can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the port of entry, migrants will be fingerprinted and checked for criminal records or deportation histories. They will be searched for weapons and examined for ailments such as head lice, chickenpox and scabies.\n\nCBP officials take a preliminary statement from migrants; later, asylum officers will interview them to see if they have a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of returning to their home countries. If so, they will enter an immigration court process in which a judge will ultimately decide. The vast majority of those who apply for asylum do not receive it.\n\nThose not applying for asylum will probably be deported.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not claiming fear, then we are expeditiously removing you,\u201d Aki said.\n\nThe caravan also includes single men who say they will attempt to cross the border illegally and others who plan to stay in Mexico.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to get asylum, so I won\u2019t do that, but I want to do things legally,\u201d said Sarah Ilatina, 28, of Tegucigalpa, Honduras. \u201cI hope [President] Trump opens his heart to us.\u201d\n\nBy the time she arrived in Tijuana on Thursday morning, carrying a plastic bag with toilet paper and water, it had been 24 hours since her last meal, she said. She joined the caravan last month because she had not been able to find work in Honduras despite her accounting degree. She has family in Miami and wants to join them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not coming to hurt anyone or take anything from anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to throw myself over the walls.\u201d\n\nTrump has likened the caravan to an \u201cinvasion\u201d and called on the U.S. military to fortify the border. U.S. Marines have strung up barbed wire between lanes of traffic at the port of entry in case migrants try to push past guards. On Wednesday, as some migrants convened on the beach in an upscale part of town, a group of residents shouted at them to go elsewhere and threatened violence. Police formed a barricade to separate the sides after a scuffle broke out. While U.S. authorities say they are prepared for anything, they expect a slow and orderly process. And so do migrants.\n\n\u201cPutting troops up at the border like we are going to do something?\u201d said Alejandro Gomez, 39, a migrant from Choloma, Honduras. \u201cWe aren\u2019t. That\u2019s all a circus.\u201d\n\nFor now, migrants are camped out at a sports complex in Tijuana and scattered among other shelters.\n\nDerien Antonio Carbajal Alvarado, 21, pitched a tent and set up cots for his pregnant girlfriend and her three daughters, ages 5, 6 and 7. He said he had been shot in the arm by gang members and went to the police after receiving more threatening texts and Facebook messages. Those messages and the police report are the evidence he hopes will sway an immigration judge, but he doesn\u2019t know for sure how it all works.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what Trump is saying; we\u2019ve been walking, and I\u2019m not a well-informed guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just a taxi driver from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and I want a better life for my daughter that is on the way, and my stepdaughters.\u201d\n\nHe has family in Dallas and hopes to somehow make it there.

(Arnulfo Franco, File/Associated Press)\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Ivan Duque was sworn in as Colombia\u2019s president in August after an easy election victory in which he promised to boost the sluggish economy by decreasing corporate taxes, while bringing order to rural areas that have long been plagued by drug trafficking and violence between armed groups.\n\nBut as he completes his first 100 days in office his plans to modernize Colombia have been beset by street protests and an unruly congress that has blocked some of his flagship initiatives.\n\nEven his own party members have spoken against a proposed tax overhaul needed by the government to raise $4.5 billion for social programs that include efforts to reintegrate thousands of former guerrilla fighters.\n\nThe 42-year-old conservative also faces challenges on the international front. Colombia is grappling with a mass influx of Venezuelans fleeing the economic collapse in their neighboring homeland, and it\u2019s under pressure from the U.S. to reverse a boom in coca growing that has put output of the main ingredient for cocaine at record levels.\n\nDuque has seen his approval ratings slump, which could further undermine his ability to push his political and economic agenda. A recent poll said only 27 percent of Colombians approve of Duque\u2019s administration, down from 52 percent in August.\n\n\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t been able to keep anybody happy,\u201d said Sergio Guzman, a political risk consultant in Bogota. \u201cI think he must be realizing that governing this country is very difficult.\u201d\n\nThe administration has been most recently targeted by a wave of student protests that have disrupted life in Colombia\u2019s main cities and led to sporadic clashes with police. Student unions are demanding the government spend at least $1.5 billion on public universities that have seen enrollment quadruple over the past two decades.\n\nDuque has so far promised only a third of that amount, saying the government has no more resources available.\n\nTo raise more funds for education and social programs, Duque has proposed a 19 percent value added tax on staple goods such as eggs and milk. That is part of a broader tax measure that also would raise taxes on large inheritances and decrease the income tax for small businesses in a bid to generate more formal jobs.\n\nThe president\u2019s own party, the Democratic Center, has opposed the bill, saying taxing food staples could hurt the middle class. It leaves him without enough congressional support to pass the measure.\n\n\u201cWe have to strengthen our work in congress,\u201d Duque said Friday during an interview with Colombia\u2019s BLU radio. He also called on politicians to avoid populist tactics and to engage in a \u201creasonable\u201d discussion of the tax bill.\n\nDuque\u2019s administration has also been off to a rocky start in the countryside, where violence is on the rise in some areas that were formerly controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which has demobilized under a peace accord to end five decades of civil conflict.\n\nAccording to a report published Friday by the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think tank, 36 human rights leaders were killed in Colombia during the past three months, twice as many as in the same period last year. The number of people displaced by armed conflict increased by 20 percent, it said.\n\nMuch of the violence is happening in areas that are now under the influence of the National Liberation Army, a guerrilla group that hasn\u2019t made peace with Colombia\u2019s government.\n\nPeace talks with the group have been suspended under the Duque administration, which has said it will negotiate with the rebels only if they stop conducting kidnappings and staging attacks on the military.\n\nJuan Carlos Garzon, a conflict analyst at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, said Duque will have a hard time resuming the negotiations. His party is demanding tougher conditions for talks, including the withdrawal of amnesty for rebels who have been involved in drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cDuque was elected by people who were critical of the previous peace process with the FARC,\u201d Garzon said. \u201cBut now that he is in power he has also realized that he must defend and pursue a peace process that is widely backed by the international community.\u201d\n\nDuque has acknowledged that many of his political proposals have been controversial. But on Friday he urged Colombians to be patient.\n\n\u201cI want the country to know that I will work each day to win the peoples\u2019 hearts,\u201d he told Blu Radio. \u201cAnd I want to prove that we are capable of transforming our realities.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nPresident Trump uses his Twitter feed, as he himself asserts, to offer the Truth to the American public. It allows him to go around the filter of the media and instead offer Real Facts to Real America. The mainstream media is just Fake News; @realDonaldTrump is the inside scoop on the Trump administration.\n\nSo we get things like this.\n\nPeople are not being told that the Republican Party is on track to pick up two seats in the U.S. Senate, and epic victory: 53 to 47. The Fake News Media only wants to speak of the House, where the Midterm results were better than other sitting Presidents. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2018\n\nNow, a cynic might argue that this is Trump trying to put a positive spin on an election cycle that, pretty obviously, didn\u2019t go well for Trump and his party. But we are not cynics. We, instead, are skeptics who can also make graphs, and so we will note that not only is Trump\u2019s presentation of history wrong, so too is his assertion that he won an \u201cepic victory.\u201d\n\nIt is obviously true that the midterm results were better for Trump than they have been for other sitting presidents in the past. That\u2019s like saying that the wreck of the Costa Concordia was better than what happened to the Titanic. Well, sure! But it wasn\u2019t good.\n\nThe Democrats gained 38 or 39 seats in the House, depending on the results of a few still-uncalled races. That, we\u2019ll note, is almost exactly what FiveThirtyEight predicted and what we had expected to see, given how unpopular Trump is. Losing that many seats is the worst performance for Trump\u2019s party since the first election after Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation and the seventh-worst performance in the past century. Those results always came when a Republican was in the White House.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Republicans have also won at least that many seats on multiple occasions \u2014 when a Democrat was president. (We added a dotted line on both the top and bottom of the graph to help make this point.) It\u2019s true that presidents often see the opposing party gain seats in midterm elections. But 2018 was worse than normal. Democratic presidents have given up an average of 33 seats since 1926. Republican presidents have given up an average of 24. Thirty-eight, our sources tell us, is higher than 24.\n\nTrump would like us to instead fixate on the results in the Senate, where the Republicans picked up two seats. (Well, actually, they picked up four seats, but they also lost two seats.)\n\nWhat\u2019s important about that figure, of course, is that it distills the 2018 election down not only to just the Senate, but only a subset of the Senate. After all, not all Senate seats were on the ballot this year \u2014 and those that were were overwhelmingly seats currently held by Democrats. (Why? In part because those up for reelection were elected in 2012, a good year for the Democratic Party.)\n\nIf you look just at toss-up Senate seats, the Republicans gained more seats. But of the 13 seats The Washington Post identified as vulnerable, the Democrats won seven. Of all of the seats on the ballot, the Democrats won more than two-thirds. Sure, that doesn\u2019t matter much in control of the Senate, and, sure, these were seats that mostly featured Democratic incumbents, often in blue states. But, still. If we\u2019re going to compare things, let\u2019s compare things.\n\nOverall, the Democrats won more of the House seats and more of the Senate seats that were on the ballot. Republicans gained in the Senate, but exclusively in states that Trump himself won in 2016.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump wants to talk about that thin slice of light red.\n\nIt is a little unusual that a party would gain ground in one chamber of Congress but not the other, but to talk about that, Trump would have to talk about how his party fared in the House, which was not great.\n\nSo instead, the Truth that Trump offers his Twitter followers is that presidents have, in the past, lost more House seats than his party lost this year.

He reeled off baseball facts that weren\u2019t in his prepared script and told a golf story.\n\nAlong the way, Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to seven Americans:Scalia, sports figures Babe Ruth, Roger Staubach and Alan Page, singer Elvis Presley, retiring Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Republican megadonor and philanthropist Miriam Adelson.\n\n[Babe Ruth\u2019s family wonders, what took so long?]\n\nThe award, created by President John F.

I always knew I liked him.\u201d\n\nScalia died in 2016.\n\nRepresentatives for Ruth and Presley, both dead for decades, accepted those awards.\n\nTrump reminded Dallas Cowboys legend Staubach that Staubach had once made a miraculous par to save their team in a golf tournament.\n\nPage, who served two decades as a judge in Minnesota after retiring from the Minnesota Vikings and the Chicago Bears, has supported current NFL players who kneel during the national anthem.\n\nTrump, seeming jovial and relaxed, said he was pleased to be the president to finally honor Ruth.\n\n\u201cI mean, let\u2019s face it. Babe Ruth is Babe Ruth, right?\u201d\n\nHe then went on an extended riff about Ruth\u2019s early career as a pitcher that departed from the printed script visible on screens at the back of the room. He added remarks about his friend Steinbrenner, who bought the Yankees 25 years after Ruth\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t know that. Babe Ruth was one of the best pitchers. He still has records today,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cIn 1920, he started with the New York Yankees. And I have heard for many years, what\u2019s the worst trade in the history of sports? Babe Ruth, 19-year-old pitcher, for $100,000, and a 35-year-old third baseman. That was not a good trade. Who was out of baseball the following season? That was not good. Of course, $100,000 is probably like $25 million today, but it was still a lousy deal.\u201d\n\nTrump asked George Steinbrenner IV to stand and told the 22-year-old auto racing owner: \u201cGeorge was a real piece of work, I have to tell you that.

Dino Babers\u2019s CV is a voluminous marvel, a bellwether of an era of mobility. It\u2019s a testament not only to movers and moving vans and boxes and robust packaging tape and, foremost, to one mighty wife and four adventurous daughters. No, it\u2019s a testament to the conquest of the fear of the unknown.\n\nSomehow, one coach has gone from Hawaii to Arizona State to Eastern Illinois to UNLV to Northern Arizona to Purdue to San Diego State to Arizona to Texas A&M to Pittsburgh to UCLA to Baylor to Eastern Illinois again to Bowling Green to Syracuse, and has wound up looking younger than his age, which is technically and meaninglessly 57. Maybe a paucity of fear breeds a paucity of creases.\n\n\u201cDino\u2019s older than you think he is; I try to say that in a nice way,\u201d said Dick Tomey, the famed former coach who oversaw Hawaii, Arizona and San Jose State, and so oversaw Babers as both a player and graduate assistant (Hawaii) and as an assistant coach and coordinator (Arizona). \u201cI guess he\u2019s in his mid-50s, and you don\u2019t get that necessarily.\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s really 57, he\u2019s adapted to it as he has to everything else.\n\nIn the beginning, well: \u201cSome young people from the mainland, they come to Hawaii and they struggle with it because it\u2019s so far away,\u201d Tomey said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. Because, as you say, he\u2019d moved all over the place.\u201d\n\n[The college football games you need to watch this weekend]\n\nBabers had the capacity to assimilate often found in the children of the military, and he explained it as he began his third head-coaching stop, at Syracuse in December 2015, having come from two excellent years at Bowling Green atop two excellent years at Eastern Illinois where he and Jimmy Garoppolo enjoyed the latter\u2019s 8,873 passing yards and 84 touchdown passes.\n\n\u201cI promise you this, okay?\u201d he told his first audience of applauders, and also reporters, at Syracuse. \u201cI promise you this: I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. I started school in Norfolk, Virginia, okay? I graduated high school in San Diego, California. And I lived everywhere in between, my Dad was 21 years Navy. He\u2019s buried in the national cemetery near Houston next to his brother. I\u2019ve been north. I\u2019ve been south. I actually have not been to the state of New York except to play at the University of Buffalo.\n\n\u201cBut to me, moving around is not a handicap, it\u2019s a blessing, okay? I\u2019ve had an opportunity to meet and greet a lot of different people in this great nation of ours. And I\u2019m hoping I can be embraced into this city \u2014 and the state of New York \u2014 because I really believe there\u2019s special things that are going to happen here. This is a move of faith, belief without evidence. I really believe that we\u2019re going to start something that people are going to be talking about for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nThe talk has gotten to percolating as Babers\u2019s third season has seen the Orange sprout from 4-8 in 2016 and 4-8 in 2017 to 8-2 here and now, its most wins at this point in the season since 2001. Crowds exceeding 40,000 at the Carrier Dome (capacity: 49,262) have been scarce in recent seasons, with only two between 2015 and 2017, for games against LSU and Clemson that just might have included a rowdy contingent of road fans. This year, from the opening 29,395 who elected to witness Wagner, Syracuse has reached 40,769 and 42,797 in its last two home games, against North Carolina State and woebegone Louisville.\n\nNow, this Saturday, a football game in a baseball stadium, which had Babers saying this week, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna act like good Marines, and we\u2019ll just adjust and improvise.\u201d He has experience in this oddity, because of course he does.\n\nHe told Syracuse reporters this week of the 2006 Emerald Bowl at AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, where the Florida State and UCLA camps had to station themselves on the same side of the field. \u201cAnd when the ball was right on the 50,\u201d he said, \u201cyou could actually hear us calling plays and hear them calling plays, so it was really weird.\u201d\n\nAt Syracuse, Babers has won attention for signature wins \u2014 over No. 17 Virginia Tech in 2016, over No. 2 Clemson in 2017 \u2014 and for the otherworldly charisma of his postgame locker-room addresses. There\u2019s the fast offense gleaned largely from Baylor days with Art Briles. There\u2019s the story that offensive lineman Koda Martin, who married one of Babers\u2019s four daughters, resides with his in-laws. Other factors can get cloaked, including something Tomey addressed from afar.\n\nSyracuse locker room is LIT pic.twitter.com/h7MElz0XiS \u2014 ESPNU (@ESPNU) October 15, 2016\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s impressive is I think their defense has improved so much,\u201d the 80-year-old former coach said. \u201cA lot of teams that have played really fast offense have struggled because their defense has to play a lot. But I think they\u2019ve managed that, and their defense has been a huge help this year.\u201d\n\nIn yards per play allowed, the Orange has gone from 124th (2016) to 113th (2017) to 81st (2018). In scoring defense, make it 120th (2016) to 98th (2017) to 70th (2018). Then there\u2019s one play the defense couldn\u2019t quite make this season, the fourth and six Clemson converted in its own home on Sept. 29 when backup quarterback Chase Brice expertly lured the safety away with his eyes before throwing for 20 yards to Tee Higgins.\n\nHad Syracuse stopped that, its surge this year might seem deeply serious rather than serious. As it stands, the season has harked back to words of unusual confidence Babers spoke at his introduction: \u201cNormally, most college football teams have enough guys that you can win. It\u2019s whether they\u2019re unselfish enough that they\u2019ll be going to the right spots so that we can win.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a lot of mentors,\u201d said the foremost among them, Tomey, who stressed that Babers has become one of those coaches who can talk with players rather than at them. Here are the coaches he has assisted (allowing for the possibility of missing somebody): Tomey, John Cooper, Bob Spoo, Wayne Nunnely, Steve Axman, Jim Colletto, Ted Tollner, Tomey again, R.C.

And it may suggest something about what the public will support, as Prime Minister Theresa May tries to sell the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with E.U. officials and her plans for what comes next.\n\nIn exchange for obeying trade rules from Brussels, May is promising the British people that she will slash the country\u2019s post-Brexit immigration levels. The 3 million Europeans already living in Britain will be allowed to stay, but the government will set new guidelines for how many foreigners will be allowed into the country, with what levels of income and from which countries.\n\nDuring a marathon session in Parliament on Thursday, May emphasized that her Brexit plan would bring an end to days when anyone in the E.U. could simply move to London, rent a flat, take a job and get on the national health-care plan.\n\n\u201cFree movement will end,\u201d May said. \u201cThat is one of the key elements, I believe, of the vote in the referendum that we need to ensure we deliver for the British people.\u201d\n\nMay has vowed to reduce overall immigration, from 100,000s annually to 10,000s, and to give preference to the high-skilled, high-earning \u201cbest and brightest\u201d over the lower-skilled, low-pay workers who currently harvest the crops, clean the hotel rooms, and care for the sick and elderly in Britain.\n\nBut the question looms: Is May looking in the rearview mirror, while the public has largely moved on?\n\nIn the days before the Brexit vote \u2014 amid a surge of migration to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa, and while the booming British economy was attracting a huge wave of workers from Eastern Europe \u2014 the pollster YouGov found that 56 percent of people named \u201cimmigration and asylum\u201d as the top issue facing the country. Last month, the figure was 27 percent.\n\nA second major polling firm, Ipsos-MORI, reported a similar drop in respondents citing immigration as \u201cthe most important issue facing Britain today\u201d \u2014 from 48 percent in June 2016 to 17 percent in October.\n\nThat\u2019s an extraordinary plunge, say polling experts \u2014 and it\u2019s mirrored by parallel surveys and focus group studies done for academics, advocacy groups and the E.U.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really quite striking,\u201d said Lindsay Richards, a sociologist at the University of Oxford who has written on the topic for the Migration Observatory, an independent research group.\n\nManchester University\u2019s Ford said that when people listed immigration as a top concern before the Brexit vote, it tended to reflect anti-immigrant sentiment, not worries about how asylum seekers pouring into Europe were being treated.\n\n\u201cI have data sets where you can see literally verbatim what is said. In all caps, people write, \u2018TOO MANY IMMIGRANTS,\u2019 or \u2018TOO MANY EUROPEANS,\u2019 or \u2018WHY CAN\u2019T THEY STOP THE IMMIGRANTS?\u2019 over and over again,\u201d said Ford. \u201cIt\u2019s no mystery what side they are on.\u201d\n\nBritain today still has high rates of immigration. But migration to Europe from North Africa has dropped to pre-surge levels. Net migration from the E.U. to Britain peaked around 189,000 the year before the Brexit vote. The latest figures show that it\u2019s around 87,000, meaning that it has more than halved in two years.\n\nPolls still find broad support for reducing the overall number of newcomers. Surveys also find respondents divided over whether immigration \u2014 and multiculturalism \u2014 is good or bad for \u201cBritish culture.\u201d\n\nBut since the Brexit vote, fewer people tell pollsters that there are too many immigrants in the United Kingdom. Britons also have become more positive about the ideas that \u201cimmigration is good for the economy\u201d and that the United Kingdom should \u201callow more E.U. workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll polls seem to suggest it\u2019s softened \u2014 people are less negative, basically on every measure you ask,\u201d said Anthony Wells, YouGov\u2019s director of political and social opinion polling.\n\nRichards said it is especially significant that the views of both \u201cremainers\" and \u201cleavers\u201d have relaxed on immigration \u2014 even as the sides remain bitterly divided over Brexit.\n\nWhile there is widespread agreement that professed attitudes toward immigration have shifted, no one has put their finger on precisely why.\n\nOpinion analysts say current worries over Brexit (now the top concern, along with the National Health Service, in opinion polls) may have replaced \u2014 or absorbed \u2014 past anxiety over immigration.\n\nOthers point to a changing news and social media landscape, with far fewer front pages depicting immigrants as job-stealing scammers.\n\nDuring their campaign, Brexiteers urged voters to \u201ctake back control,\u201d a powerful phrase that, in a single stroke, encapsulated the ideas of regaining lost authority over immigration and sovereignty, one of the other drivers of the Brexit vote.\n\nThere were also more-overt appeals to fuel anti-immigrant emotions, with micro-targeted ads on Facebook and mass-media campaigns.\n\nVote Leave, the official group campaigning for Brexit, falsely claimed that Turkey was about to join the E.U., and that gun-toting Turkish mobsters would be one\u2019s new neighbors.\n\nNigel Farage, who led the pro-Brexit U.K. Independence Party, unveiled a poster featuring Syrian and other asylum seekers marching through East European fields next to the slogan \u201cBreaking point.\u201d\n\nIn the months before the Brexit vote, British tabloid newspapers splashed stories on their front pages with headlines such as \u201cMigrants Rob Young Britons of Jobs,\u201d \u201cMigrant Workers Flooding Britain\u201d and \u201cWorkers Are Fired for Being British.\u201d\n\nAccording to one researcher, over a six-year period starting in 2010, the Daily Express carried front-page migration stories on 179 occasions, and the Daily Mail, 122 times.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the former chancellor of the exchequer who campaigned for Britain to remain in the E.U., recently told the BBC that his Conservative Party\u2019s remain campaign didn\u2019t do enough to promote the benefits of European immigration.\n\nBut fast-forward two years, and public space is no longer dominated by fears of Britain being overwhelmed by migrants, but rather by concerns about how Brexit may disrupt life and hurt the economy, especially if Britain \u201ccrashes out\u201d of Europe in a no-deal \u201cdoomsday scenario.\u201d\n\nThe biggest immigration story since the Brexit vote didn\u2019t have anything to do with E.U. workers or migrants from the Middle East and North Africa. It was about the \u201cWindrush generation,\u201d people brought legally from Commonwealth countries in the Caribbean to help rebuild Britain after World War II, only to find their legal status questioned by British authorities decades later.\n\nWhen Brexit news features E.U. migrants, the stories typically highlight how Britain could lose European nationals who contribute to the economy by working as berry pickers, baristas, and nurses at the National Health Service.\n\n\u201cPeople are realizing there are trade-offs,\u201d said Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThere is a greater realism in the media coverage and the public debate.\u201d\n\nRosie Carter, a senior policy officer with the group Hope Not Hate, said when her organization offered an online anonymous survey, where self-selected, non-randomized respondents could choose a number from 1 to 10 (very negative to very positive) to describe their feelings about immigration, the majority choose either 1s or 10s \u2014 meaning they went to the extremes, which is what many people experience through social media.\n\nBut when the group hired professional pollsters to survey a representative sample, they found that most Britons are \u201cbalancers,\u201d who see the dueling \u201cpressures and gains\u201d of immigration.\n\nWells, of YouGov, wonders how much the shift in opinion on immigration has to do with how the tribes of Brexit \u201cleavers\u201d and \u201cremainers\u201d want to think of themselves.\n\nThe roughly half of voters who identify as remainers are able to defend their position on Brexit by associating even more strongly with a pro-immigrant stance, Wells said. The leavers, on the other hand, are hostile to the suggestion they voted to exit the European bloc because of migrants, which has been cast as a bigoted or even racist position.\n\n\u201cMy assumption is that it\u2019s connected to Brexit and connected to how people see themselves now, how people identify,\u201d Wells said.\n\nThose who oppose Brexit say softer attitudes toward immigration should bolster their call for a second referendum, arguing that if the citizens have changed their thinking about a core issue, why not stage a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d before signing off on May\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nBut a second plebiscite is opposed by the prime minister, who says it would be anti-democratic. A do-over is only halfheartedly embraced by the opposition Labour Party, whose leaders worry about losing the working-class supporters who want Brexit.\n\nWhile people are less negative about immigration than they were two years ago, the majority still want to see numbers come down, said Kully Kaur-Ballagan, research director at Ipsos-MORI polling.\n\n\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said, \u201cit could reemerge as an issue.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s family is in row over Brexit\n\nCould Brexit bring new troubles to Northern Ireland?\n\nHere are some of the \u2018no-deal Brexit\u2019 doomsday scenarios.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Wijnaldum and Depay strike as Netherlands beats France 2-0", "description": "Midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum scored just before half time and Memphis Depay converted an extra-time penalty as the Netherlands team that did not qualify for the summer\u2019s World Cup beat world champion France 2-0 on Friday in the Nations League", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/wijnaldum-and-depay-strike-as-netherlands-beats-france-2-0/2018/11/16/e7566d3c-e9e9-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:52:26Z", "content": "ROTTERDAM, Netherlands Midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum scored just before halftime and Memphis Depay converted an audacious extra-time penalty as the Netherlands team that did not qualify for the World Cup beat world champion France 2-0 on Friday in the UEFA N\u2026 [+1276 chars]", "fulltext": "Netherlands players celebrate scoring 2-0 during the international friendly soccer match between The Netherlands and France at De Kuip stadium in Rotterdam, Netherlands, Friday, Nov. 16, 2018.

Ronald Koeman\u2019s resurgent young team beat France 2-0 on Friday and this time the margin of victory flattered the French.\n\nThe rampant men in orange, driven forward by the pinpoint passing of midfielder Frenkie de Jong and given a creative spark in attack by Memphis Depay\u2019s trickery, could have scored five. Only a string of saves by France captain and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris managed to keep the score respectable for the recently crowned world champion.\n\nThe Dutch victory relegated Germany from the top tier of the new UEFA Nations League, a second humbling this year after Germany crashed out of the World Cup at the group stage four years after winning the tournament in Brazil.\n\nNow the Netherlands, which didn\u2019t even qualify for the last World Cup or the 2016 European Championship, needs just a draw against Germany on Monday in Gelsenkirchen to win League A Group 1.\n\n\u201cThis was a complete match at the very highest level,\u201d said Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman, who has in a matter of months turned an underachieving team into a European force to be reckoned with. In its last three matches, the Netherlands has beaten Germany 3-0, drawn with top-ranked Belgium 1-1, and outclassed France.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate this Dutch team,\u201d France coach Didier Deschamps said. \u201cThey played a very good match. They had a lot of quality.\u201d\n\nMidfielder Georginio Wijnaldum scored just before halftime and Memphis Depay converted an audacious stoppage-time penalty as the Dutch overran the world champion.\n\nFrance tried to play a waiting game, sitting back and hoping to launch speedy 19-year-old striker Kylian Mbappe on the break. But led by midfielder De Jong and center back Virgil van Dijk, the Dutch not only dominated possession, but also shut down the World Cup star.\n\n\u201cIt is exceptional how he reads the game,\u201d Koeman said of De Jong.\n\nThe result left the Dutch one point behind France in League A Group 1 ahead of the group\u2019s final match, between the Netherlands and Germany on Monday, when Joachim Loew\u2019s team will be playing only for pride.\n\nWijnaldum broke the deadlock just a minute before halftime with his 10th international goal in his 52nd appearance for the Netherlands.\n\nDepay doubled the lead with a \u201cPanenka\u201d penalty in stoppage time, chipping the ball over Lloris to complete a memorable victory.\n\nThe Netherlands must wish they could play every match at Feyenoord\u2019s De Kuip stadium \u2014 the victory extended the Dutch run of wins there to 15.\n\nA depleted France arrived in Rotterdam after injuries sidelined Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial, Benjamin Mendy, Thomas Lemar, Lucas Hernandez and Thomas Lemar.\n\nDeschamps refused to use their absence as an excuse for his team\u2019s lackluster display.\n\n\u201cWe had confidence in the players we had here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lost to a Dutch team that played very well and we did not play well.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the Nations League, Denmark beat Wales 2-1 in Cardiff to secure promotion from League B Group 4. Nicolai Jorgensen and Martin Braithwaite scored for the Danes before Gareth Bale hit a late consolation goal.\n\nSlovakia beat Ukraine 4-1 in League B Group 1.

Why don\u2019t you go across the river to Arlington for that ceremony? Barack Obama went every year he was here in D.C. TRUMP: I should have done that. I was extremely busy on calls for the country. We did a lot of calling, as you know.\n\nWhen pressed, Trump seemed to scale back his regret, saying he \u201ccould have\u201d done it but offering more reasons it wasn\u2019t ideal. But then he again admitted that he \u201cshould have\u201d attended:\n\nWALLACE: But this is Veterans Day. TRUMP: I could have done that. As you know, I just left the day before the American Cemetery [in France] and I probably think \u2014 and that was one where it was raining as hard as you can imagine, and I made a speech at the American Cemetery the day before. And I probably, you know \u2014 in retrospect, I should have and I did last year, and I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American Cemetery in Paris, and I really probably assumed that was fine, and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state \u2014 doing other things. WALLACE: Why ... TRUMP: But I would have \u2014 I would have done it.\n\nTrump was on a trip to Asia on Veterans Day 2017 so did not visit Arlington then, but he did on Memorial Day in both 2017 and 2018.\n\nTrump\u2019s allergy to apologizing is well-established. He has said he doesn\u2019t feel as though he has basically anything to apologize for, despite breaking myriad promises and routinely stoking controversy that gives even his fellow Republicans heartburn.\n\nSo this is significant \u2014 even as Trump watered down the quasi-apology by noting his other obligations.\n\nHe simply doesn\u2019t allow for the idea that he was wrong that often. The most high-profile example of a Trump apology was when The Washington Post reported on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that contained audio of him talking about grabbing women by their genitals.\n\nLike that example, this may have been a bridge too far \u2014 especially considering the context of the missed appointment. Just a couple days before, he also skipped a trip to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery outside Paris, which he contends was due to rain and an inability of the Marine One helicopter to navigate the weather. That was two missed events at high-profile military cemeteries \u2014 on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I \u2014 from a man who has made restoring the military a calling card of his presidency and stump speeches.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that Trump actually didn\u2019t have any appointments on his public schedule Monday \u2014 the day Veterans Day was observed. It\u2019s not clear how busy he actually was for most of the day, though The Post\u2019s Carol D.

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump on Friday made the rare step of admitting to a mistake \u2014 sort of.\n\nIn an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d which will air this weekend but portions of which were released on Friday, Trump acknowledged that he \u201cshould have\u201d visited Arlington National Cemetery for Veterans Day ceremonies on Monday, after returning from France the night before:\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: But here\u2019s the question: You\u2019re back in Washington on Monday, Veterans Day. Why don\u2019t you go across the river to Arlington for that ceremony? Barack Obama went every year he was here in D.C. TRUMP: I should have done that. I was extremely busy on calls for the country. We did a lot of calling, as you know.\n\nWhen pressed, Trump seemed to scale back his regret, saying he \u201ccould have\u201d done it but offering more reasons it wasn\u2019t ideal. But then he again admitted that he \u201cshould have\u201d attended:\n\nWALLACE: But this is Veterans Day. TRUMP: I could have done that. As you know, I just left the day before the American Cemetery [in France] and I probably think \u2014 and that was one where it was raining as hard as you can imagine, and I made a speech at the American Cemetery the day before. And I probably, you know \u2014 in retrospect, I should have and I did last year, and I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American Cemetery in Paris, and I really probably assumed that was fine, and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state \u2014 doing other things. WALLACE: Why ... TRUMP: But I would have \u2014 I would have done it.\n\nTrump was on a trip to Asia on Veterans Day 2017 so did not visit Arlington then, but he did on Memorial Day in both 2017 and 2018.\n\nTrump\u2019s allergy to apologizing is well-established. He has said he doesn\u2019t feel as though he has basically anything to apologize for, despite breaking myriad promises and routinely stoking controversy that gives even his fellow Republicans heartburn.\n\nSo this is significant \u2014 even as Trump watered down the quasi-apology by noting his other obligations.\n\nHe simply doesn\u2019t allow for the idea that he was wrong that often. The most high-profile example of a Trump apology was when The Washington Post reported on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that contained audio of him talking about grabbing women by their genitals.\n\nLike that example, this may have been a bridge too far \u2014 especially considering the context of the missed appointment. Just a couple days before, he also skipped a trip to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery outside Paris, which he contends was due to rain and an inability of the Marine One helicopter to navigate the weather. That was two missed events at high-profile military cemeteries \u2014 on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I \u2014 from a man who has made restoring the military a calling card of his presidency and stump speeches.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that Trump actually didn\u2019t have any appointments on his public schedule Monday \u2014 the day Veterans Day was observed. It\u2019s not clear how busy he actually was for most of the day, though The Post\u2019s Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey report that he met with his lawyers for four hours on Monday regarding answers to questions from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nHe also didn\u2019t have a visit to Arlington National Cemetery scheduled, so the call on this was apparently made well in advance.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump's schedule for Monday.\n\nSo we\u2019re basically in the position of taking Trump\u2019s word for it that whatever he was dealing with that day \u2014 besides his lawyers \u2014 was more important.

The war, nearly four years old, may have killed as many as 80,000 people, according to the figures. (Hani Mohammed, File/Associated Press)\n\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The U.N. envoy for Yemen announced Friday the country\u2019s internationally recognized government and rival Houthi Shiite rebels have agreed to attend talks aimed at ending their three-year war, which has created the globe\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis by pushing the Arab world\u2019s poorest country to the brink of famine.\n\nMartin Griffiths told the U.N. Security Council that he planned to bring the warring parties together \u201csoon\u201d in Sweden. He also said the Houthis and the government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, were about to conclude an agreement on exchanging prisoners and detainees.\n\nThe spotlight has fallen on what many viewed as the long forgotten war in Yemen since the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia\u2019s consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Griffiths said he is determined to take advantage of \u201cthe international attention and energy\u201d to move toward peace.\n\n\u201cWe must seize this positive international momentum on Yemen,\u201d he told the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body. \u201cThis is an opportunity at a crucial moment to pursue a comprehensive and inclusive political settlement to the conflict.\u201d\n\nGriffiths said preparatory issues for the meeting are close to being resolved and he has sent the parties his \u201cvision\u201d for \u201cU.N.-led, inclusive Yemeni negotiations to end the war and restart a political transition process.\u201d\n\nThe conflict in Yemen began with the 2014 takeover of the capital of Sanaa by the Iranian-backed Houthis, which toppled the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.\n\nSaudi-led airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals and wedding parties and killed thousands of Yemeni civilians. The Houthis have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia and targeted vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nCivilians have borne the brunt of the conflict, which has killed over 10,000 people and created what the executive director of the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program said Friday is \u201ca catastrophe.\u201d\n\nDavid Beasley, who just returned from a three-day visit to Yemen, told the Security Council that \u201cwe do not need to wait for formal declarations about famine or even a full report to act.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that because of what I saw and heard this week children are already dying,\u201d he said.\n\nBeasley warned that \u201cstarvation is on the horizon unless circumstances change \u2014 and change immediately.\u201d\n\nRight now, he said, his agency is helping about 8 million people a month in Yemen but the situation has become \u201cextremely dire.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf the 28 million Yemenis, we believe that as many as 12 million or more Yemenis \u2014 yes, that\u2019s right, almost half of the entire country \u2014 are just one step away from famine,\u201d Beasley said.\n\nThat number has doubled in the last year and a half and the situation is getting even worse, largely because of the collapse of Yemen\u2019s economy and the sharp decline in its currency, he said.\n\nTo avert famine, Beasley said, the international community must combine increased humanitarian funding with \u201can all-out effort to restore the Yemeni economy.\u201d\n\nHe said that will require scaling up assistance to help 12 million Yemenis, which would require about $150 million to $160 million a month. And it would require a cash injection of $200 million a month into Yemen\u2019s economy to stabilize its currency and stave off economic collapse, he said.\n\n\u201cYemen is on the brink \u2014 so together we must act,\u201d Beasley said. Otherwise, he warned, \u201cwe will be in the position of deciding which children live and which children die.\u201d\n\nU.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock, who warned the council on Oct. 23 that the economic crisis and escalating conflict had pushed Yemen closer to famine than ever before, also urged its members to take action now.\n\nIn addition to also urging the parties to negotiate an end to the conflict and the international community to boost aid, he called for a humanitarian cease-fire around key aid facilities, delivery of humanitarian and commercial imports to all Yemeni ports and onward to their final destinations, and funding to pay Yemeni pensioners and civil servants.\n\nBritain\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Karen Pierce, said she will circulate a Security Council resolution Monday to address the Yemen crisis and put Lowcock\u2019s requests \u201cinto practice.\u201d\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Jonathan Cohen told the council: \u201cThis war must end soon, and it won\u2019t end on the battlefield.\u201d He reiterated U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s words: \u201cThe United States seeks a cessation of hostilities in Yemen.\u201d\n\nLowcock noted that after an upsurge in fighting immediately after his Oct. 23 briefing to the council, there has been \u201ca welcome de-escalation\u201d in the last two days.\n\n\u201cBut what we need to know is that this lull is going to be sustained,\u201d Lowcock said. \u201cIt remains urgent for the parties to agree a cessation of hostilities.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But they say Britain\u2019s own demands undermined its goal of \u201ctaking back control\u201d and necessitated that it remain tethered to the E.U.\n\nEuropean leaders say there are no alternatives that would satisfy British desires \u2014 offering a stark choice between swallowing this plan or crashing out of the E.U. with no safety net at all, a prospect that could spark economic chaos around the world.\n\nMost observers agree that the Europeans had the upper hand in the deal, as a normally fractious bloc of 27 nations stood unusually united behind its team of Brexit negotiators. But that nominal victory has been little solace for European leaders who never wanted Britain to leave and still believe that they will all be hurt once it departs.\n\n\u201cWhat was always an illusion on the Brexiteer side was that the kind of world you could return to was when Britain had an empire and was a global superpower in the world economy,\u201d said Fabian Zuleeg, the chief executive of the European Policy Center, a Brussels think tank with close ties to the E.U.\n\n\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray demonstrates near Parliament in London on Thursday. (Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThose on the pro-E.U. side have argued that Brexit would make Britain weaker, since it would leave Britain with no formal ability to influence decisions in its most important export market.\n\n\u201cSomehow the recognition that those things were not a negotiation tactic, but that they actually are just simple statements of fact, is finally starting to sink in, but probably too late,\u201d Zuleeg said.\n\nIn London, Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a rebellion from lawmakers in her Conservative Party. By Friday, at least 23 Conservative members of Parliament had signed letters demanding a confidence vote that could topple her from office, according to British reporters. Forty-eight letters are required to trigger a vote.\n\nMay tried to stabilize her cabinet Friday by installing a third Brexit secretary, after the first two quit in protest. Stephen Barclay is a former junior health minister who voted to leave the E.U. A BBC politics editor described him as \u201cultra-loyal, having never rebelled against the government.\u201d\n\nMany Brexiteers want May to rip up this deal \u2014 the product of more than a year of talks \u2014 and start again, even as the calendar dwindles ahead of Britain\u2019s March 29 exit date.\n\n\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street on Friday. (Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBrexiteers also complain that the E.U. has singled them out for punishment to set an example to other countries that might contemplate divorce from Brussels. E.U. officials retort that British leaders have fouled up the Brexit process so sufficiently on their own that they don\u2019t expect other countries to follow London\u2019s precedent.\n\nNegotiators warn there is little further to be achieved at their level, and even some Brexit advocates say this is the best deal under the circumstances. \u201cWe think this is the best we can do collectively with the constraints we have on both sides,\u201d said an E.U. official briefing reporters about the deal under ground rules of anonymity.\n\nIn the end, the direction of the deal was profoundly shaped by tiny Northern Ireland: Britain wants its territory to remain borderless with the Republic of Ireland, to preserve the peace, and with the rest of the United Kingdom, to maintain national unity.\n\n\u201cIf what you want is to deliver on leaving the European Union, and have frictionless trade in goods at the border for the next few years until a future free-trade agreement comes into force, and have control of our own immigration policy, and keep the United Kingdom together, all at the same time \u2014 well then, a deal is going to look pretty much like this one seems to look like,\u201d former Tory foreign secretary William Hague said this week. \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to be dramatically different from that.\u201d\n\nThe deal maintains E.U. rules and obligations in Britain during a transitional period lasting until the end of 2020 as negotiators hammer out plans for future relations between the two sides. Britain would be on the hook for the financial commitments it made while it was a member \u2014 about $50 billion in total \u2014 plus a significantly smaller amount for the time it is in the transitional deal.\n\nBut if the talks for future relations fall apart, Britain would be bound into the E.U.\u2019s customs union indefinitely \u2014 a status that has set off alarms in London because it would effectively strip Britain of its ability to forge its own trade deals, the precise opposite of the goal of many Brexit supporters.\n\nIf that \u201cbackstop\u201d went into effect, Britain would have to abide by E.U. tariffs, essentially handing off its negotiating power to Brussels. And E.U. negotiators say the customs union is probably going to be the basis for negotiations over the future relationship anyway, causing further heartburn in London.\n\nEuropeans say the arrangement is the only way to avoid borders around Northern Ireland \u2014 and several countries, including France and Spain, say it is already a concession. They fear the British could use the tariff-free access to the E.U. market to undercut European businesses, and they have sought to pile on provisions that would ensure British producers would face the same regulations as their European competitors.\n\n\u201cThere is worry in a number of capitals that the Brits or companies or others would take advantage of the situation,\u201d said Josef Janning, the head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAmid the British infighting, European leaders have said the discussions are closed.\n\n\u201cIt is highly unlikely that we will make important changes to these proposals,\u201d Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Friday, echoing comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel a day earlier. \u201cWe have talked about this for so long.

In a victory for the cable network and for press access generally, Judge Timothy J. Kelly granted CNN\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order that will prevent the administration from keeping Acosta off White House grounds.\n\nIn essence, the court held that the White House could not take away Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights without due process; in the case of this White House, there apparently isn\u2019t any process. The judge chided the White House, remarking that there was still no clear answer as to who pulled Acosta\u2019s press pass. Moreover, in an especially pointed rebuke to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders (who regularly misleads reporters), the court found the allegation that Acosta placed his hands on an intern \u201clikely untrue.\u201d (The DOJ lawyers didn\u2019t try to defend that allegation or the doctored video Sanders sent around, so it was especially significant that the court brought it up sua sponte.)\n\nThe White House is purportedly drafting guidelines for the press meant to enforce \u201cdecorum.\u201d We\u2019ll see if those sustain legal scrutiny. Yet to be litigated is a permanent order or the merits of the First Amendment (\u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d) claim. The Post was among the media companies that signed onto an amicus brief in support of CNN.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union responded, \u201cToday\u2019s decision reaffirms that no one, not even the president, is above the law. The White House surely hoped that expelling a reporter would deter forceful questioning, but the court\u2019s ruling will have the opposite effect.\u201d\n\nThere are a few interesting aspects to the ruling.\n\nFirst, the Justice Department had a hard case but did a lousy job of litigating. Jonathan Peters, press freedom correspondent for Columbia Journalism Review, tweeted on Wednesday:\n\nI should add that it appeared the govt lawyer didn't entirely understand how news is gathered and reported. To me, that was significant b/c it hobbled or otherwise undermined his arguments that revocation of Acosta\u2019s credentials irreparably harmed Acosta, CNN, and the public. \u2014 Jonathan Peters (@jonathanwpeters) November 14, 2018\n\nSecond, Judge Kelly is a Trump appointee, which should remind us that, once judges get on the bench, they can show remarkable ingratitude to the president who put them there. They don\u2019t want to be reversed on appeal or ridiculed by their peers. They know a future president (and/or Senate) may decline to elevate them to a higher court if they lack legal prowess. Most judges, even ones Trump nominated, try to get it right. Moreover, for all its norm-busting, the White House apparently is not ignoring the ruling nor ridiculing the court. Score one for the rule of law.\n\nThird, the court reaffirmed that while the White House doesn\u2019t have to let reporters in, once it does the First and Fifth amendments do not allow it to arbitrarily (and in this case, under false pretenses) pull credentials. It will be interesting to see what guidelines the White House comes up with. If they are content-neutral, objective rules (e.g., one follow-up question only), they are more likely to withstand scrutiny than if the White House sets up subjective criteria (not deferential enough? out you go!). Remember that there is a separate lawsuit still pending challenging Trump\u2019s conduct in chilling all reporters\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\nFourth, even Fox News joined in the amicus brief, although its nighttime hosts continue to berate aggressive reporting by the mainstream media. Let\u2019s hope that, perhaps with some prompting from new conservative legal group Checks and Balances, headed by George T. Conway III, conservatives who fancy themselves defenders of the Constitution start defending it when Trump tramples on it.\n\nFinally, Trump lost. He flat-out lost, albeit on narrow grounds, in his attempt to intimidate reporters. As in the case ordering him to stop blocking critics on Twitter, Trump cannot do whatever he pleases. As Victoria Baranetsky put it, given that \u201cthe President openly espouses enmity against reporters, it is more important than ever to articulate constitutional safeguards for the fourth estate.\u201d Each time the courts check the executive, democracy regains ground from a lawless president.\n\nRead more:\n\nErik Wemple: Trump-appointed judge: Get CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta back in the White House\n\nJennifer Rubin: Trump\u2019s Orwellian argument for violating CNN\u2019s First Amendment rights\n\nErik Wemple: Network endorses de-credentialing of CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta\n\nMolly Roberts: Sarah Sanders\u2019s diabolically clever attack on Jim Acosta\n\nJennifer Rubin: Three very positive signs for democracy"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mancini wants to \u2018bring Italy back where it belongs\u2019", "description": "A year after its stunning elimination by Sweden in a World Cup playoff, Italy is back at the San Siro stadium for another potentially decisive match", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/mancini-wants-to-bring-italy-back-where-it-belongs/2018/11/16/e51c4656-e9e2-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:02:16Z", "content": "MILAN A year after its stunning elimination by Sweden in a World Cup playoff, Italy is back at the San Siro stadium for another potentially decisive match.

It was simply because of our inability to predict the temperature in the immediate Washington area down to a degree, not just at the ground but at layers several thousand feet into the atmosphere.\n\n[Winter\u2019s sneaky arrival: Thursday\u2019s snow accumulation numbers, and how this freak storm happened]\n\nWe were successful in predicting how the storm would evolve in broad strokes: that it would start before dawn Thursday, that the worst would come through during the commute, and that it would turn into a mess. And that the snowiest conditions would focus in our colder areas north and west of the city.\n\nBut it snowed more than we thought, and disruptive amounts of snow even reached the city.\n\nWe called for a coating to an inch of snow along and west of Interstate 95. One to three inches fell.\n\nIn our far north and west areas, we predicted one to three inches. Twice that much came down.\n\n\n\n(Capital Weather Gang and National Weather Service)\n\nOur \u201cboom\u201d scenario, intended to convey the possibility snow might exceed our expectations, played out all across the region. In some cases, it was even more than a boom.\n\nTemperatures about 5,000 feet into the atmosphere were about a degree colder than most of our models predicted. We expected more sleet. Instead, more snow fell. Snow piles up faster than sleet. It also lowers temperatures near the ground faster. For both of these reasons, the storm and the snow had a greater impact on the region.\n\nThis was simply a forecast in which the margin of error was tiny. One or two degrees was going to make the difference between hardly any snow and enough snow and sleet to turn a morning commute into chaos.\n\nQuick peek at some forecast errors for yesterday's snowstorm ... some predictions were ever so slightly too warm (couple degrees) the night before, both aloft and near the surface. When those errors straddle 32F, it can make a decent forecast get ugly quick. pic.twitter.com/KxolthZjhF \u2014 Greg Postel (@GregPostel) November 16, 2018\n\nThis isn\u2019t about making excuses but, unfortunately, our modeling tools, while very, very good, aren\u2019t yet quite good enough to nail the forecast to this degree of accuracy.\n\nThe fact our modeling tools have these errors is the whole reason we try to communicate uncertainty and include boom and bust scenarios.\n\n[Here\u2019s how half a foot of snow led to a commuting nightmare in New York City this week]\n\nThat said, it\u2019s worth exploring whether we adequately communicated the uncertainty in this case. I think we did, but perhaps we could have placed more emphasis on the possibility the storm could be worse than our forecast lead on.\n\nLet\u2019s look back at what our forecast discussions actually said. While we were not confident what form precipitation would take, we repeatedly used such words as \u201cmessy,\u201d \u201csloppy\u201d and \u201cslick\u201d to describe the morning commute. Our major briefing on the storm, published Wednesday morning and updated in the afternoon and evening, said the following:\n\n\u201cA messy commute is a given.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is \u2026 some chance that precipitation could come down heavily right away, at least for a time. If this occurs, conditions could go downhill quick. Do plan to start early, check in with us, and take it slow if you are headed out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe period of greatest concern is between about 7 a.m. and 11 a.m., coinciding with the morning commute, when temperatures will be lowest and the chance of frozen precipitation highest.\u201d\n\nFor areas inside the Beltway and south and east, \u201ca few slick spots cannot be ruled out during any heavier bursts of frozen precipitation \u2014 which are possible during the morning commute Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an event where just a few degrees will make a big difference in how much snow and wintry mix occurs and where, so surprises are possible if not likely.\u201d\n\nI think these statements accurately conveyed the risk that the morning commute could be difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, we included some statements and drew some conclusions that were frankly wrong and a little too dismissive of the risk for areas inside the Beltway and just to the south and east:\n\n\u201cAir and road temperatures should be high enough so that frozen precipitation that falls, mostly in the morning, melts.\u201d\n\n\u201cStorm conditions do not merit a rating on our impact scale in this zone. We generally do not expect delays and cancellations in this zone, unless conditions turn out to be worse than expected.\u201d\n\nOf course, conditions did turn out worse than expected, and anyone who read the above statements may have understandably drawn the conclusion this event wouldn\u2019t be that bad.\n\nUnfortunately, when a forecast is so sensitive to a degree or two, as communicators we want to try to have it both ways. We want people to understand there is a risk and be prepared for the possibility, but we also don\u2019t want them to be overly alarmed.\n\nThen there\u2019s problem that some people will read into a forecast what they want to read. Some will latch on to the messages that are most alarming; others will read that this might not be a big deal and conclude that it won\u2019t be a big deal. I\u2019m not sure how we overcome this problem.\n\nI welcome any suggestions on how folks think we might have better communicated this forecast in the comment area or any other constructive feedback."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Sarah Kaplan, The Washington Post", "title": "Scientists plot new rover's exploration of Mars - Chron.com", "description": "LOS ANGELES - In three years, a new explorer will touch down on the Red Planet.

Other 2018 recipients included Elvis Presley, former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), former NFL great and Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Alan C. Page and conservative political donor Miriam Adelson.\n\nFor Ruth\u2019s family and a legion of historical admirers, their reaction is the same: It\u2019s about time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that he\u2019s finally been recognized, but what the heck took so long?\u201d asked Tom Stevens, Ruth\u2019s grandson.\n\nThe president agreed.\n\n\u201cHe raised money and raised hell,\u201d Trump said in his opening remarks Friday. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s taken him a long time to get this award.

No contest.]\n\nDuring one trip to Kansas City in 1927, Ruth and Lou Gehrig visited three orphanages (two white, one black), two newspapers and Mercy Hospital, for white people only, before a parade at noon and exhibition game at 2:30, Leavy wrote in her biography.\n\nSomewhere along the schedule, representatives from Wheatley-Provident Hospital, the black hospital in town, invited Ruth and Gehrig to stop by. Ruth skipped lunch at the Kansas City Athletic Club to visit sick children and posed for a photograph in the Kansas City Post cradling an emaciated infant.\n\nThe image circulated among the nation\u2019s most prominent African American newspapers. The Chicago Defender a short time later declared Ruth \u201ca friend of the race.\u201d\n\nRuth longed to manage a Major League ballclub after he retired, but league executives banded together to keep him out of the dugout, Gibbons said, afraid he\u2019d try to integrate the game a decade before Robinson broke the color barrier.\n\nIn 1942, Ruth, who as a young child spoke German, signed on to an open letter to the German people denouncing \u201cthe Hitler policy of cold-blooded extermination of the Jews of Europe\u201d and called on them \u201cto overthrow a regime which is the infamy of German history.\u201d\n\nA lifelong Catholic, Ruth raised money for St. Mary\u2019s Industrial School for Boys, the boarding school were he lived most of his childhood, once taking the school\u2019s band on tour for fundraisers when the chapel burned down, according to Gibbons. On several occasions, he purchased cars for Brother Matthias Boutlier, one of the school\u2019s prefects, who became his lifelong mentor.\n\n\u201cBy nature he was very kind and very generous, probably generous to a fault. It didn\u2019t occur to him to be anything else,\u201d Stevens said. Ruth adopted Stevens\u2019s mother in 1929. Now 102 years old, Julia Ruth Stevens did not travel from her home in Las Vegas to the White House for the ceremony.\n\n[How Babe Ruth ushered in the era of the home run and the sports celebrity]\n\nThe White House contacted Tom Stevens, 66, in mid-October to tell him Ruth would be honored in November with an award, though officials did not specify which honor. When Stevens told officials he would accept on behalf of Ruth and his mother, they revealed Trump\u2019s plan to bestow the Medal of Freedom.\n\nTen members of Stevens\u2019s family planned to attend the ceremony, along with two cousins who are descendants of the late Dorothy Ruth Pirone, Ruth\u2019s daughter from his first marriage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to President Trump that he finally recognized the Babe,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cGod knows when it would have happened.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nA stellar Packers-Seahawks matchup can\u2019t disguise the fact that there are problems with \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d\n\nA Fitchburg State basketball player was suspended indefinitely after a brutal sucker punch\n\nAs California copes with devastating wildfires, high school teams try to play on\n\nMedal of Freedom honoree Alan Page will put aside his feelings about Trump"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Political 'veteran' at age 36 eyed for Trump chief of staff", "description": "Nick Ayers could almost be confused for a college fraternity brother as he flashes a broad grin in a selfie taken with Mike Pence just moments after the Indiana governor was named Donald Trump's running mate", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/political-veteran-at-age-36-eyed-for-trump-chief-of-staff/2018/11/16/e68d55da-e9e1-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:55:08Z", "content": "WASHINGTON Nick Ayers could almost be confused for a college fraternity brother as he flashes a broad grin in a selfie taken with Mike Pence just moments after the Indiana governor was named Donald Trumps running mate.

(Andrew Harnik/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Nick Ayers could almost be confused for a college fraternity brother as he flashes a broad grin in a selfie taken with Mike Pence just moments after the Indiana governor was named Donald Trump\u2019s running mate.\n\nIn fact, the baby-faced campaign strategist in the white undershirt had a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s selection of Pence in 2016. And two years later, Ayers\u2019 bond with Pence is stronger than ever, as are his ties to the president.\n\nA seasoned campaign veteran at age 36, Ayers is emerging as a leading contender to replace White House chief of staff John Kelly, whose departure has long been the subject of speculation.\n\nIf selected, Ayers would return a political mind to the role as Trump\u2019s presidency enters a new, more perilous phase in which he fights for re-election while fending off new oversight efforts from a Democratic House.\n\nIn any administration, the role of White House chief of staff is split between the responsibilities of supervising the White House and managing the man sitting in the Oval Office. Striking that balance in the turbulent times of Donald Trump has bedeviled both Kelly and his predecessor, Reince Priebus. If Ayers becomes the third person to tackle the job, it\u2019ll be his most significant challenge \u2014 and one friends say he\u2019s well-equipped to handle.\n\n\u201cHe manages up as well as anyone I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Phil Cox, a former colleague at the Republican Governor\u2019s Association who bought Ayers\u2019 political consulting business earlier this year.\n\nTrump is said to have warmed to Ayers in part by watching the effectiveness of Pence\u2019s largely independent political operation. The vice president\u2019s chief of staff for the last 18 months, Ayers has earned the backing of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, for taking on the new role, White House officials said.\n\nAyers would be the youngest chief of staff since 34-year-old Hamilton Jordan served under Jimmy Carter.\n\nBut before Ayers can have his crack at leading the White House staff, he first has to overcome opposition from some who may soon work for him.\n\nOn Air Force One on Sunday as Trump returned to the U.S. from a turbulent two-day trip to Paris, aides argued to the president that Ayers was the wrong person for the job, according to two people familiar with the matter. More than a half-dozen administration aides spoke about Ayers on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matter.\n\nIn some corners of the White House, Ayers is viewed skeptically over how he has led Pence\u2019s office, which operates largely independent of the Trump West Wing. Some in the White House blame Ayers for planting news stories critical of the administration or its strategies, while others have complaints about his efforts to circumvent the president\u2019s political operation. Some aides have taken to calling him \u201cTricky Nicky.\u201d\n\nAyers, a former aide to agriculture secretary and former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, is blamed by some in the White House for orchestrating the president\u2019s endorsement of the state\u2019s Secretary of State Brian Kemp for governor, a Perdue ally whom they believe wasn\u2019t the strongest candidate in the GOP primary. Republicans spent millions and deployed the president to defend the red state seat against a strong challenge from Democrat Stacey Abrams. Kemp holds a slight lead over Abrams and the Election Night results have yet to be certified.\n\nAyers didn\u2019t respond to a request for an interview. But allies said he is eager to take on the chief of staff job. He and Trump have been discussing the possibility of making the switch for months.\n\nA Georgia native with a distinct southern twang, Ayers is the father of young triplets. His meteoric rise in GOP politics included a successful stint at the Republican Governors Association, time as campaign manager for Tim Pawlenty\u2019s failed White House bid and a political consultant work for dozens of high profile Republicans across the country \u2014 including Pence.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to matter what he gets involved in, he immediately becomes incredibly valuable,\u201d said Cox.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Ayers was seen as a Pence loyalist who also managed to have a good rapport with Trump\u2019s insular campaign team.\n\n\u201cThe campaign trusted him,\u201d said Republican operative Brian Baker, president of the pro-Trump Future 45 Super PAC. \u201cHe was a rare guy who was able to work with both teams.\u201d\n\nBefore he joined the administration, Ayers was among the founders of the pro-Trump political group America First Policies, which works in concert with Pence\u2019s political operation.\n\nAllies said that while Ayers isn\u2019t as deeply versed in foreign policy as some of his predecessors, he had developed experience advising Pence on global affairs. He has been a frequent participant in Trump\u2019s daily intelligence briefings, occasionally even when Pence wasn\u2019t present.\n\nThe timing of Kelly\u2019s expected departure isn\u2019t clear, though White House aides predict it will occur in tandem with the anticipated exit of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in the coming months.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, is asking a federal judge to keep him out of prison until a constitutional challenge to the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election is resolved.\n\nIn a motion filed Friday, Papadopoulos\u2019s lawyers revealed that he has been ordered to report to serve his 14-day sentence on Nov. 26.\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019s brief stint in prison would bring to a close a key piece of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. A tip that Papadopoulos was told by a professor in London in April 2016 that the Russians had dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, in the form of thousands of emails, helped spark the first investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia in July 2016.\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019s lawyers argued Friday that he is not a flight risk and that little harm would result from allowing him to put off his prison sentence until a case that could invalidate his conviction is resolved.\n\nA three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard arguments earlier this month in the case, which involves a former assistant to Trump confidante Roger Stone who has been subpoenaed to provide testimony in front of Mueller\u2019s grand jury.\n\nThe assistant, Andrew Miller, has refused to comply. His legal team has argued Mueller\u2019s appointment was unconstitutional because Mueller\u2019s authority is too broad and his work has too little oversight from the Department of Justice.\n\n[Roger Stone associate challenges Mueller\u2019s special counsel appointment]\n\nMiller\u2019s lawyers contend that Mueller\u2019s authority has made him essentially akin to a \u201cprincipal officer\u201d under the Constitution, which would require confirmation by the Senate.\n\nAttorneys for Mueller have argued that he is in fact an \u201cinferior officer,\u201d like other Justice Department officials, and that his work has been supervised by an official appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, Deputy Attorney Gen. Rod J. Rosenstein.\n\nIt is not yet clear how arguments in the case might be affected by President Trump\u2019s replacement of former attorney general Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the investigation, with acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker, who has not gone through the confirmation process. Mueller and Miller have until Monday to file additional briefs on how Whitaker\u2019s appointment affects the case.\n\nRegardless of how the appeals court panel rules, the issue could ultimately be considered by the Supreme Court.\n\nTwo federal judges at the district court level have ruled that Mueller\u2019s appointment was constitutional in other cases, but Miller\u2019s case is the first to be reviewed at the higher appellate level.\n\nPapadopoulos waived his right to appeal his conviction when he pleaded guilty last year. But his attorneys argued that should Mueller\u2019s appointment be ruled unconstitutional, the finding would amount to new evidence that would allow for him to move to have his conviction tossed.\n\n\u201cThe question on appeal is not frivolous. George deserves the benefit of waiting for the court of appeals\u2019 decision before reporting to serve his sentence,\u201d Caroline Polisi, a lawyer for Papadopoulos, said in a statement. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no harm in staying his sentence in order to see the outcome of this case. If the Mueller appointment is found to be unconstitutional, there is obviously a very strong argument for invalidating George\u2019s conviction.\u201d\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019s conversation with a professor in London about Russia and Clinton came months before emails allegedly hacked by Russian intelligence were publicly released through WikiLeaks. Papadopoulos recounted the tip to an Australian diplomat, who in turn told American officials \u2014 launching the first investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia in July 2016.\n\nPapadopoulos told a judge in September that he was remorseful for lying to the FBI about certain details of his encounter with the professor and two Russians to whom the professor introduced him. He told the judge that he made a \u201ca terrible mistake, for which I have paid a terrible price, and am deeply ashamed.\u201d\n\nMore recently, he has been active on Twitter, alleging that he was set up by Western intelligence.\n\nThis week, he replaced the Chicago-based lawyers who helped him negotiate his plea deal with Mueller with a new team from the Los Angeles-based firm Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht, suggesting he had new plans to fight his conviction."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/philip.kennicott", "title": "How record-setting art auctions are ruining the old neighborhood - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post How record-setting art auctions are ruining the old neighborhood Washington Post Art critics generally hate it when an auction house sets a record.

Thursday, at Christie\u2019s in New York, a painting by David Hockney fetched more than $90 million (or $80 million plus fees), making him the living artist with the most expensive work ever sold at auction. Every time something like this happens, there is the inevitable question: Is a work of art worth that kind of money?\n\nThat question is really two questions, and most people don\u2019t bother to distinguish them. It is superficially an economic question, about the market, about how the market values Hockney and which works of Hockney it tends to prize. But it is also a moral question: Should a painting be worth what the state of Utah spent on homeless care in a year, or the cost of inpatient opioid addiction treatment for thousands of people, or the construction of a few rural health centers?\n\nIt\u2019s fairly easy to answer the first of these questions, about the market and Hockney\u2019s status within it. The 1972 painting, \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures),\u201d bought by an unknown bidder, is one of Hockney\u2019s best-known works, depicting two male figures, one standing at the edge of a swimming pool, the other swimming in it. It appears on Hockney\u2019s Wikipedia page and was recently seen in the enormously successful Metropolitan Museum of Art retrospective of the British painter\u2019s work.\n\nIts value isn\u2019t just based on its fame, however. It is one of Hockney\u2019s most enigmatic double portraits, which depict relationships often fraught with tension, loss or the peculiar and acute loneliness we feel only in the presence of someone with whom we have lived for a long time. Although it was painted in England and was based on a scene in southern France, it has the hues and ambiance of Hockney\u2019s sun-soaked Southern California works. And it is a classic among the painter\u2019s daring representations of homosexual love and desire in the 1960s and \u201970s. So it is a quintessential work by a painter, now in his early 80s, whose importance is being reevaluated and newly appreciated.\n\nThe second question, however, forces people who care about art to parse its meaning and importance in alien terms. And those terms almost dictate the answer. Would this money be better spent on health care or education? Of course \u2014 which forces the critic to seek some other form of parsing the problem, something that isn\u2019t quantifiable in blunt terms. And very quickly you arrive at something that is both true and a cliche: That the value of art can\u2019t be reckoned in dollars, nor can it be related to other tangible human needs that are more pressing. Its worth and importance are things that stand to the side of ordinary human valuations of the world.\n\n[A new building erases the last physical traces of a transformed newspaper]\n\n\n\nBritish artist David Hockney at a 2016 book fair in Frankfurt, Germany. (Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters)\n\nBut there is a deeper discomfort than simply reiterating a cliche about the intangible value of human creativity, and it\u2019s more troubling than any polite squeamishness about reducing everything to money. When a work of art sells for a quantum of money larger than any ordinary person\u2019s practical reckoning, it seems to make art foreign to ordinary humanity. The feeling is akin to what it\u2019s like to arrive back to some beloved place that has been gentrified so thoroughly that it now feels almost hostile to its former inhabitants.\n\nGentrification is about displacement, about the market coming in, taking things that felt like accessible common property and making them so uncommonly expensive that they are no longer what they once were. A small restaurant that a family could eat in for $50 becomes a boutique restaurant in which $50 barely covers the appetizers. The change isn\u2019t just about how much it costs to eat there. It is about the loss of a place where you once went, once felt welcome. Something that was once habitual, a part of a beloved place \u2014 buying a cup of coffee or getting a haircut \u2014 becomes a locus of exclusion.\n\nIn some ways, that is what happens to art when it sells for such extraordinary sums. Suddenly people seem to care about it, but the thing they care about is not the thing you remember when you last saw it. Like a chic new bar or a hot new neighborhood, it has \u201cbuzz,\u201d but the people who are buzzing about it are not the people you know from your community of art lovers.\n\n[David Hockney at the Met: A blockbuster exhibition]\n\nWe often cherish what we think of as a private relationship to art, even art that is owned by other people or that hangs in public spaces. But when a work of art is suddenly known to the world not for its content but its price tag, it feels like a betrayal of our private relationship to the piece. Like a gentrified neighborhood, it has evolved into something else, something more popular, something of interest to a wider audience. And somehow, for some reason, perhaps involuntarily, no matter how hard we try to resist it, that seems to dilute or even negate the feelings we once had for it.\n\nConsider the thing we often say when we revisit a place that has been taken over by developers and the moneyed crowd: The place we loved no longer exists. In one sense, that\u2019s not true. Of course it exists \u2014 the houses still stand where they once stood and the streets still meet at their usual corners. But in another sense it is absolutely true. The place is lost to us, and we no longer participate in its meaning.\n\nThat metaphor may explain why critics hate the market, hate auctions, hate record-selling paintings and sculpture and hate the ephemeral buzz and hype that come with each new stratospheric price tag. Perhaps it\u2019s an irrational feeling, and perhaps whoever bought this painting will donate it to a museum where it will be forever a public possession. But the feeling of loss and alienation remains, and the anxiety it causes is real. When rich people speculate in art, you can\u2019t help but think: There goes the neighborhood."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Maria Butina, alleged Russian agent who met with NRA and other groups, is in plea talks - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Maria Butina, alleged Russian agent who met with NRA and other groups, is in plea talks Washington Post Attorneys for a Russian woman jailed on charges of seeking to infiltrate the National Rifle Association and other American conservative gro\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/maria-butina-alleged-russian-agent-who-met-with-nra-and-other-groups-is-in-plea-talks/2018/11/16/a3d55748-e9c7-11e8-b8dc-66cca409c180_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xvg4pT4bcU3-_S9nL8Tv2GlsO9k=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/62O6AJEJ4MI6RCXKQ3UIVZ3A3A.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:37:30Z", "content": "Attorneys for a Russian woman jailed on charges of seeking to infiltrate the National Rifle Association and other American conservative groups for the Russian government are in negotiations with federal prosecutors, both sides said in a court filing Friday.

Mueller III\u2019s investigation.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are increasingly concerned that Mueller\u2019s probe may be under internal threat after Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appointed his former chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker, as acting attorney general, overseeing the probe. Lawmakers from both parties have questioned the constitutionality of that decision, noting that Whitaker was never confirmed by the Senate to his job, and argued that his public statements reveal an anti-Mueller bias too strong to allow him to assume authority over the investigation.\n\nIn the Senate, Arizona Republican Jeff Flake \u2014 who is retiring at the end of the year \u2014 has insisted he will not vote to advance any of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees until the body votes on a measure to protect the special counsel from being fired without cause. In the House, that measure stands little chance of being taken up before the end of 2018 \u2014 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has said he does not think it is necessary.\n\nHouse Republicans are keenly aware that they have only a few weeks left to call the shots on panels that have been investigating the officials investigating Trump \u2014 and the subpoenas for Comey and Lynch seem to reflect that they will be using their authority until they are forced to hand committee gavels, and the subpoena power that comes with them, to the Democrats at the start of next year.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the outgoing Majority is resorting to these tactics,\u201d the Judiciary Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), who is expected to take over as chairman next year, said in a statement. \u201cThese subpoenas are coming out of the blue, with very little time left on the calendar, and after the American people have resoundingly rejected the GOP\u2019s approach to oversight \u2014 if, indeed, \u2018oversight\u2019 is the word we should use for running interference for President Trump.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether panel Republicans will attempt to force other witnesses, particularly Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, to appear for interviews in the weeks that remain. Last month, Rosenstein agreed to speak only to the committee chairmen and ranking Democrats \u2014 an arrangement that angered rank-and-file Republicans, who said Rosenstein should not get special treatment. The session never happened, however, because of time constraints.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of a band of members who have tried to orchestrate Rosenstein\u2019s impeachment, is expected to run for the top Republican slot on the Judiciary or Oversight committee next year. Thursday on Twitter, he questioned why Rosenstein had not been brought to Capitol Hill to face a reckoning over reports that he proposed taping interactions with Trump and attempting to remove him from office by invoking the 25th Amendment \u2014 a sign that Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill are going to keep insisting on an interview.\n\nDevlin Barrett contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Erik Wemple", "title": "This is your government on Trump", "description": "Once again, President Trump makes an impromptu mess, and his colleagues in the government break out the mops and the buckets.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/11/16/this-is-your-government-on-trump/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/P50ot2fK33zPmpVD4H71wJL5xZw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AC264MQJVIZBZGYQPAAWAZGSMA.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:33:28Z", "content": "Bureaucratic improvisation has never been a more precious skill than under President Trump, a man who will say anything, do anything at any time.

(Photo by Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nMedia critic\n\nBureaucratic improvisation has never been a more precious skill than under President Trump, a man who will say anything, do anything at any time. Most of the actions are ill-considered, the product of bad moods, such as when, on Nov. 7, he scolded CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta during a news conference following an election that ousted Republicans from the House majority. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what: CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn\u2019t be working for CNN,\u201d Trump said to Acosta after some sparring about immigration. \u201cYou\u2019re a very rude person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible. And the way you treat other people are horrible. You shouldn\u2019t treat people that way.\u201d\n\nHours later, Acosta discovered that his hard pass to the White House had been revoked.\n\nThus began a process in which CNN appealed for Acosta\u2019s reinstatement and, when that effort produced no results, sued top White House officials over the matter, on due process and First Amendment grounds. The CNN complaint argued that the White House had failed to comply with ground rules stemming from the 1977 case Sherrill v. Knight, which held that the First Amendment \u201cliberty interest\u201d in a White House pass required appropriate procedures before revocation. Or, in the words of the court: \u201cIn our view, the procedural requirements of notice of the factual bases for denial, an opportunity for the applicant to respond to these, and a final written statement of the reasons for denial are compelled by the foregoing determination that the interest of a bona fide Washington correspondent in obtaining a White House press pass is protected by the first amendment.\u201d\n\nIn the CNN complaint, Theodore Boutrous of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher argued, \u201cDefendants did not provide Plaintiffs a written explanation, nor any explanation at all, before revoking Acosta\u2019s press credentials. The only written explanation was a short statement posted on Twitter that Acosta was suspended because he \u2018plac[ed] his hands\u2019 on a White House staffer. Even if this tweet were accurate\u2014and it is not, as the reportedly doctored video Defendant Sanders posted would later show\u2014it would not suffice to demonstrate prior notice of the revocation.\u201d\n\nThat persuasive claim required a governmental reply, and here\u2019s where ex-post-facto-Trump-nonsense improvisation comes into play. In Wednesday\u2019s oral arguments over CNN\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order to reinstate Acosta\u2019s hard pass, Deputy Attorney General James Burnham discussed the process with Judge Timothy Kelly. \u201cIn this case, the deprivee received [notice] twice. The president himself said during the exchange \u2014 he didn\u2019t say what the outcome would be, but he told Mr. Acosta that he was being rude and disorderly,\u201d Burnham said.\n\nKelly interrupted to ask about whether Acosta received pre-deprivation notice. \u201cI think here . . . what happened was good enough,\u201d said Burnham, who conceded that the president \u201cdid not say, \u2018I\u2019m revoking your hard pass tonight. Send me a letter if you want and I\u2019ll read it before we make our final decision.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Post\u2019s Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker documented last month how government officials scramble to adorn reality so as to shed a ray of plausibility on the false statements or wild promises of President Trump. Such madness arose after Trump in October promised a 10 percent tax cut before the midterm elections for middle-class folks, a fantasy. Trumpites raised the prospect of some kind of resolution expressing a commitment to the president\u2019s loose promise.\n\nA similar dynamic hovers over the CNN suit. When Trump trashed Acosta with the cameras rolling, it looked like the undisciplined and irate rambling of a man who woke up to find his political future in question. After CNN filed its suit, the rant turned into something approaching red tape \u2014 an official and compulsory warning to a journalist of impending bureaucratic action.\n\nJudge Kelly rooted out the fraud. In accounting for his granting of the TRO in Friday\u2019s court session, the judge broke down the government\u2019s thin case. \u201cAs for notice, the government points to only one statement that could possibly constitute prior notice to Mr. Acosta that his pass would be revoked: The president\u2019s statements to him during the exchange at the press conference on Nov. 7,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut the president\u2019s statements did not reference Mr. Acosta\u2019s hard pass at all, let alone that it would be revoked.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tarabahrampour", "title": "Supreme Court will hear arguments concerning Census citizenship question - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Supreme Court will hear arguments concerning Census citizenship question Washington Post The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments Friday over whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross can be compelled to testify in a case regarding the Trump ad\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/16/supreme-court-will-hear-arguments-concerning-census-citizenship-question/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6Kgxynch9T0Zx8aTAKm_Gh_alQk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OE4O6EXJ2AI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:23:49Z", "content": "The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments Friday over whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross can be compelled to testify in a case regarding the Trump administrations addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch wrote at the time that they would have delayed the trial until the Supreme Court could weigh in on the bigger questions.\n\nRoss announced in March that the question would be added to the household survey for the first time since 1950, saying it was needed to help enforce the Voting Rights Act. The states, cities and groups challenging it say it will intimidate some \u2013 particularly in immigrant communities \u2014 from participating and result in an inaccurate count.\n\nAll sides have said that the legal battle should move quickly, because the Census questionnaire needs to be completed by next spring.\n\nThe Supreme Court set oral argument in the case for Feb.19. Trials in cases in California and Maryland are scheduled for January.\n\nThe government has argued that Ross\u2019s testimony is unnecessary, saying he has already explained his actions and that it was improper for courts to authorize \u201can intrusive fishing expedition involving the depositions of high-ranking government officials, including a cabinet Secretary.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs in the case say Ross should be deposed based on \u201cshifting and inaccurate\u201d public and private statements he has made regarding his reasons for adding the question.\n\nRoss had told Congress that he added the question in response to a December 2017 request for it from the Justice Department.

Chief among them were the decisions recognize the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and to move the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv. Though the Israeli government is based in Jerusalem, most nations keep their missions in Tel Aviv on the principle that its status should be decided through negotiations with the Palestinians who also seek part of the city as their capital.\n\nThe United States also has closed the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington and a separate U.S. Consulate that served Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli government has been lobbying the Trump administration to recognize its sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is known for its tourist spots and wineries. It also is home to an estimated 22,000 Druze who speak Arabic and have families in Syria.\n\nBut the Golan has grown more tense, and a demilitarized buffer zone has been built to separate Israel and Syria. The Syrian side has experienced heavy fighting recently between pro-government forces and opposition rebels, with the latter surrendering much of the area to the Russian-backed government.\n\nThe Golan resolution was the last of nine introduced expressing support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and renewing the mandate of the U.N.\u2019s \u201cspecial committee to investigate Israeli practices affecting t\n\nhe human rights of the Palestinian people and other Arabs of the Occupied Territories.\u201d\n\nAll the resolutions passed by overwhelming majorities, with no more than 10 votes in opposition.\n\nIn remarks after the votes, Syria\u2019s U.N. ambassador Bashar Jaafari said the U.S. vote on Golan showed the United States has relinquished its role as a sponsor of peace efforts in the Middle East.\n\nIsrael\u2019s ambassador Danny Danon thanked the United States for its moral stance on the resolution and said the real threat to the region comes from the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the support it gets from Iran.\n\n\u201cThousands of people are being slaughtered every day by the evil Assad regime,\u201d he said. \u201cgiven the opportunity to slander Israel, the world forgets about the atrocities.\u201d\n\nDanon said the Golan Heights is critical for Israel\u2019s security, and is its rightful territory.\n\n\u201cIsrael will not withdraw from the Golan Heights,\u201d he said. \u201cit is time for the international community to accept it.\u201d\n\nJafaari objected to the use of the name Golan Heights and said hilltops no longer offer a military advantage in an era of rockets and planes.\n\n\u201cEven if it were true,\u201d he added, \u201cthis is Syrian territory, and will return to Syria whether Israel likes it or not.

Bush had 80 and George H.W. Bush had 71.\n\nThe lifetime appointments fulfill Trump\u2019s campaign promise to remake the federal judiciary by packing the courts with conservative judges. The nominations were aided by the Republican-controlled Senate and changes in chamber rules that call for a simple majority in the confirmation of federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, instead of the 60 votes required previously.\n\n[Trump promised to remake the courts.

She missed her parents.\n\nOrbelina Orellana and Elmer Alberto Cardona were hundreds of miles and two countries away in a small town in southern Mexico, making their way toward the United States with thousands of others in a desperate caravan, leaving their loved ones behind.\n\nDespite the distance, Orellana was able to get a picture and audio recording from her daughter\u2019s birthday party in Honduras via WhatsApp and hear the little girl sob: \u201cI love you, Mommy,\u201d words that left the mother crushed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even want to get up,\u201d she said of the bittersweet moment.\n\nLike thousands of others, Orellana and her husband have relied on social media, text messages and brief cellphone calls to connect with worried loved ones back home as they traverse a country that can often be deadly for migrants.\n\nThe birthday recording gave her comfort and courage to continue the difficult journey of nearly 3,000 miles (nearly 5,000 kilometers) by foot, bus and hitchhiking as they head toward the Mexican border city of Tijuana.\n\nAt the frontier with San Diego, many in the caravan hope to ask for asylum in the United States, though it could take weeks or months as they take their places at the end of a line of thousands of others in the slow-moving application process.\n\nYears ago the migration trail north could be something of a black box. People might set out and not be heard from again until months later after reaching the U.S. and phoning from a relative\u2019s house, or suddenly showing up back home after being caught at the border and deported.\n\nTechnology has changed that.\n\nNot everyone in the caravan has a smartphone, and for those who do, coverage can be spotty in the Mexican countryside. At times it\u2019s hard to find a hotspot or a charge. But for those who do, they\u2019re precious cargo. Many share them with fellow migrants who eagerly log in to Facebook and other apps to send or receive a quick message.\n\nSome NGOs also facilitated free calls home for migrants, with the Red Cross organizing more than 4,000 of them.\n\nOrellana, 26, and Cardona, 27, have tried to call Brithani and her two siblings each evening when the caravan stops for the night, usually to sleep outdoors in public squares.\n\n\u201cI tell her I will always love her ... and she tells me not to miss her, that she is going to send for me,\u201d said Janeisy Nicolle, the couple\u2019s 5-year-old middle daughter.\n\nOften, in these brief conversations, neither side tells the whole truth for fear of causing worry.\n\nOrellana and Cardona, for example, didn\u2019t get into the fact that he had been stranded for a while on a desert highway in a dangerous part of Mexico, where migrants often fall prey to robbery, extortion, kidnapping and murder.

Many more children have been left with relatives so as not to expose them to the dangers of the trip.\n\nOrellana and Cardona are convinced they made the right choice in leaving their children behind and hope to reunite with their little ones if they make it to the United States and find work.\n\nViolent political protests in Honduras last year closed many of the stores where they used to buy small electronics goods to sell on the street. Ultimately they were spending almost everything they made on transportation, with little left for food.\n\nSo they borrowed money from the only people who lend to the poor in Honduras \u2014 gang members, who charge exorbitant interest. When they were unable to repay the $250, their debt suddenly became $700. Then the death threats started to come.\n\n\u201cIf there is no way to pay it, they look for other ways,\u201d Orellana said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was afraid.\u201d\n\nOn top of it all, their small wooden home collapsed.\n\n\u201cThey suffered a lot,\u201d said Orellana\u2019s mother, 69-year-old Evangelina Murillo.\n\nMurillo, who has cancer, lives with her daughter and son-in-law, two sons and now her three grandchildren in the two-room home donated by a local church in the rural outskirts of San Pedro Sula. It\u2019s a dangerous place: Another son was killed by a thief who was trying to steal his pig.\n\nThat kind of violence and poverty are the reasons cited again and again by migrants who joined the caravan.\n\nOrellana and Cardona had tried four years ago to emigrate from Honduras, only to be deported from Mexico. When they heard about the caravan on the TV news in October, they figured they didn\u2019t have anything to lose.\n\nThe hardest part was when Brithani held onto her mother and begged to come with them, crying, \u201cDon\u2019t leave me, mommy, don\u2019t leave me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t take her, the risk was too great,\u201d Orellana said, clutching at two Virgin of Guadalupe medals hanging around her neck, one of them engraved with the initials of her three kids.\n\nThe daily phone calls from Mexico stopped for a while when the couple\u2019s cellphone was stolen, until they started traveling with someone else who had one. During that time the only news their anxious family back home received was from the TV \u2014 scenes of tear gas and border clashes between migrants and Mexican police, and unfounded rumors that a child had died in those disturbances at a bridge between Guatemala and Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhen we see those images, we worry and I just ask God to take care of them for me,\u201d Murillo said.\n\nThinking about their children is the only thing that helped the couple when life got tough with the caravan. Like when they lost their IDs on the border bridge amid the clashes. Or clambering aboard foul-smelling garbage trucks to travel more quickly and keep up with the rest of the group. And the days of slogging dozens of miles (kilometers) underneath a baking sun, and falling sick when colder temperatures set in.\n\n\u201cWhenever I felt like returning, I told myself, \u2018Damn, I\u2019d be going home to the same misery as always,\u2019\u201d Orellana said. \u201cIf I\u2019ve come this far, I have to face whatever comes to provide a better life for my children.\u201d\n\nNearing Tijuana, the couple said they were still undecided whether they would try to cross into the United States or ask for refuge in Mexico.\n\nAnd on Sunday their thoughts will again be back home, this time with Janeisy: It\u2019s her sixth birthday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo by Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nIn Florida, as Yogi Berra might say, it\u2019s deja vu all over again.\n\nEighteen years after the infamous recount to decide Florida\u2019s vote in the 2000 presidential election, Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner announced on Thursday that the state will conduct a manual recount of ballots in this year\u2019s election for U.S. Senate \u2014 potentially overturning the slim lead currently held by Republican Gov. Rick Scott over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson.\n\nSo how will Florida go about recounting these ballots? And can voters expect a fair count, or will it be tainted by partisanship?\n\nLet\u2019s look at what Florida law says about recounting ballots \u2014 and what political science research says about how that process actually might work.\n\nWhat Florida law says\n\nFlorida\u2019s Election Code requires a manual recount for any election in which the initial margin of victory is 0.25 percent or less. Essentially, in a manual recount election officials will reexamine any paper ballots that were initially set aside as overvotes (votes for multiple candidates in a given race) or undervotes (votes for none of the candidates in a given race), in hopes of discerning the voter\u2019s intent. Fortunately, there are no dimpled chads this time around. But there are bound to be stray marks, scribbles and other anomalies that would prevent voting machines from recognizing these potential votes.\n\nSo how does an election official determine voter intent? Many states provide guidelines for doing so in the case of a manual recount. Some states, such as Minnesota, have very specific rules for determining intent. Others, such as North Carolina, offer less guidance. Florida gives ballot counters a few examples to help guide the recount. For each example, the question the ballot counter is trying to answer boils down to this: Regardless of whether voters followed the provided instructions, did they mark their ballot in a consistent manner that expresses \u201ca definite choice\u201d? If so, count the vote. If not, don\u2019t count it.\n\nSimple enough, right? Our research suggests the answer is no.\n\nIt matters who counts the ballots \u2014 and how\n\nIn 2010, we conducted an experiment to test how partisanship and other factors might influence a ballot recount. Our \u201cballot counters\u201d consisted of 340 undergraduate students from Ohio State University who participated in exchange for extra credit in political science courses. Of these, 20 percent of participants identified as people of color, 45 percent were women, and their ages ranged from 18 to 45, with a median age of 20 years old.\n\n[Was it a \u2018blue wave\u2019 or not? That depends on how you define a \u2018wave.\u2019]\n\nWe asked these participants to decide whether to count or reject ballots in a disputed election, using actual ballots from Minnesota\u2019s contested 2008 U.S. Senate election between Democrat Al Franken and Republican Norm Coleman. But, using photo editing software, we manipulated the information that appeared on each ballot. And we randomly varied the ballot counting instructions provided to each of six groups.\n\nTwo groups of participants saw ballots with no party labels whatsoever; one of those two groups saw ballots with specific counting rules, and the other saw ambiguous ballots. The other four groups received party-labeled ballots with: (1) fictional candidates and specific counting rules, (2) fictional candidates and ambiguous counting rules, (3) real candidates and specific rules or (4) real candidates and ambiguous counting rules.\n\n\n\nClean ballot, no errors\n\n\n\nOvervote \u2014 or retraction?\n\n\n\nOvervote \u2014 or pencil rest mark?\n\n\n\nOvervote \u2014 or cross-out?\n\nOur results show that ballots can be recounted fairly, at least in some circumstances. Democrats and Republicans basically agreed on how to count disputed ballots when they were given specific rules for determining voter intent and when the ballots included fictional candidates from the two major parties.\n\nBut in other cases \u2014 including many similar to those that will be recounted in Florida \u2014 the voter\u2019s intent was truly in the eye of the beholder. That is, Democrats and Republicans disagreed quite a bit on how to count ballots when they were provided with ambiguous rules for determining voter intent and when the ballots included actual candidates from a recent election, with their party labels.\n\nAnd it is probably no coincidence that the vote counters tended to rule in favor of their party\u2019s candidate. In fact, there was more than a one in three chance that someone who \u201cstrongly\u201d identified as a Democrat or Republican would accept a ballot challenge favoring their party. But if it favored the other party, the chances of accepting a ballot challenge were only one in five.\n\nIn practical terms, for every 100 ballot challenges favoring one party, \u201cstrong\u201d members of that party would accept 36. \u201cStrong\u201d members of the other party would only accept 20.\n\nIn a disputed election likely to be determined by a small number of votes, this difference between what ballot judges will accept based on their partisan preferences could be large enough to shape the outcome. But here\u2019s a key point: This partisan difference is reduced by more than half when ballot judges are given specific, rather than ambiguous, instructions about how to determine voter intent. Our experimental results suggest that specific rules for judging disputed ballots can limit the effects of partisanship and thus lead to a fairer counting of votes.\n\nIn Florida, rules provide guidance for a variety of hypothetical scenarios, but there are bound to be ambiguously marked ballots. And, certainly, the stakes are high. Partisanship may play a big role in resolving ambiguously marked ballots that are not clearly addressed by ballot counting rules.\n\n[Why we\u2019re still waiting for election results from Florida and Georgia \u2014 and why newly counted ballots favor Democrats]\n\nCan recounts be fair?\n\nIn our experiment, we found that this partisanship can bias the vote-counting process, especially when the political stakes are high. Clear recounting guidelines can mitigate these biases, but they can also lead to ballots being rejected because of accidental stray pen marks even when voter intent is otherwise clear.\n\n[These 5 charts explain who voted how in the 2018 midterm election]\n\nWe found that merely instructing ballot judges to determine intent is not explicit enough to override deep-seated partisan attachment. And in situations where every vote could tip the election results, these partisan attachments matter.\n\nAs voting by mail becomes more widespread, state election officials may find it even more difficult to craft rules that define which ballots \u201ccount.\u201d That\u2019s because election officials need to match the signatures on mail-in ballots to a voter\u2019s signature at the time of registration. And such an interpretation is also subject to partisan and other biases. Is that \u201ct\u201d crossed in the same way \u2014 or the \u201ci\u201d dotted similarly? Is that signature slanted differently than this one? And who\u2019s she voting for, anyway?\n\nHere again, what should be an objective judgment could be open to interpretation. But as we show, clear and explicit guidelines can help to diminish the power of partisanship in our ever more partisan nation.\n\nKyle C.

But by 1941, Timely editor Joe Simon, co-creator of Captain America, decided to give the then-18-year-old a shot at a story.\n\nSimon and Jack Kirby had launched Captain America the previous year with a nod to rising anti-Semitism and the United States\u2019s resistance to enter the war. The character\u2019s classic debut cover, of course, features Steve Rogers socking the Fuhrer in the jaw.\n\nBy May of 1941, U.S. entry into the war was still more than a half-year away, and the Nazis are never explicitly mentioned in Lee\u2019s debut story, \u201cCaptain America Foils the Traitor\u2019s Revenge\u201d \u2014 yet military bravery and betrayal are very much in Lee\u2019s mind when scripting his tale.\n\nLee would soon serve three years in the Army during the war, writing training-film scripts in New Jersey before his discharge, after which he joined the publisher Timely/Atlas.\n\nThe rise of Marvel Comics was still nearly two decades away, but Lee\u2019s interest in writing comic-book heroes who fought evil and injustice was sparked by wartime. So it was only natural that when IDW was set to publish \u201cWe Spoke Out: Comic Books and the Holocaust\u201d earlier this year, Lee would be chosen to write the introduction and afterword.\n\nLee, the eldest son of Romanian Jewish immigrants, had co-created such characters as the X-Men and Black Panther with an eye toward promoting unity among all people.\n\n\"I always felt the X-Men, in a subtle way, often touched upon the subject of racism and inequality, and I believe that subject has come up in other titles, too,\u201d Lee told me two years ago, \u201cbut we would never pound hard on the subject, which must be handled with care and intelligence.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in the intro the \u201cWe Spoke Out,\u201d Lee writes: \u201cAmidst all the thrilling tales of superheroes foiling evil villains, my colleagues and I have more than once used the pages of comic books in an effort to educate readers about real-life topics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe Spoke Out,\u201d by Neal Adams, Rafael Medoff and Craig Yoe, collects Holocaust-related comic-book stories, including superheroes from the Marvel universe that Lee helped create and promote.\n\n\u201cStan was not only the worldwide face of comics \u2014 he always had a unique appreciation for the potential of comic books to talk about real-world issues,\u201d Yoe tells The Washington Post\u2019s Comic Riffs. \u201cIn the 1970s, at a time when most people thought of comics as junk for kids, Stan was defying the Comics Code Authority by writing and publishing issues of Spider-Man dealing with the drugs crisis.\n\n\u201cSo he was exactly the right person to write the introduction for a book that demonstrates how comics confronted genocide.\u201d\n\nHere, in full, is Lee\u2019s \u201cWe Spoke Out\u201d introduction, which is believed to be his last essay published prior to his death:\n\nBy Stan Lee\n\nPeople don\u2019t usually associate so profound and forbidding a topic as the Holocaust with the costumed superheroes and bombastic villains who inhabit the world of comic books. But the truth is that those colorful characters aren\u2019t the only residents of the comic book universe, and comic books can serve more purposes than entertainment alone.\n\nAmidst all the thrilling tales of superheroes foiling evil villains, my colleagues and I have more than once used the pages of comic books in an effort to educate readers about real-life topics. When I wrote the storyline about drug abuse for three issues of Amazing Spider-Man in 1971, and when Neal Adams and Denny O\u2019Neil created stories about drugs, racism, pollution, and other hot-button subjects for Green Lantern/Green Arrow from 1970 to 1972, we were no longer just comic- book creators. We were also teachers.\n\nI\u2019m very proud that comic creators have taught about the Holocaust, too.\n\nSometimes we forget that talking about the Holocaust is a relatively new thing for most Americans. Sure, thirty-five states now require teaching the Holocaust in public schools. But the first of them, Illinois, adopted that policy as recently as 1990. There were very few opportunities for young people to learn about the Nazi genocide during the years before that, although comic book creators made an effort to fill that gap.\n\nAs far back as 1955, Al Feldstein and Bernard Krigstein created the astounding comic story \u201cMaster Race,\u201d about an encounter between a Holocaust survivor and a Nazi war criminal. To this day, that story gives me chills. As far as I know, it was the first attempt by comic creators to address the Holocaust and, appropriately, it is the first story in this volume.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, in the pages of comic books such as Marvel\u2019s Captain America and Sgt. Fury, DC\u2019s Star Spangled War Stories and Sgt. Rock, and James Warren\u2019s Eerie magazine, writers and artists used the comics medium to teach young people about one of the darkest eras in human history. For more than a few, a story in a comic book was their first exposure to the Holocaust. I take great pride in the role comics creators played in introducing this topic. Because educating young people about the Holocaust is crucial to ensuring that such an indescribable atrocity will never be repeated. And there can be no more important mission than that."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Designer of Brazil soccer team kit dies at age 83", "description": "The man who designed Brazil\u2019s soccer uniform has died at age 83", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/designer-of-brazil-soccer-team-kit-dies-at-age-83/2018/11/16/44586fe6-e9d9-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:53:20Z", "content": "SAO PAULO The man who designed Brazils soccer uniform has died at age 83.

(Chris Carlson/AP)\n\nA tweet from MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d summarized the dramatic shift seen in Orange County, Calif., politics in the 2018 election. Two years ago, following the election of President Trump, most of the county was represented in the House by members of the Republican Party. As of Friday morning, after the race in California\u2019s 45th District was called for Katie Porter (D), and with Gil Cisneros (D) taking a hard-to-beat lead in the 39th, the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d map is now solidly blue.\n\nCongressional districts in Orange County, Calif. in 2016 and in 2018 pic.twitter.com/TWRQ1pPzS4 \u2014 Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) November 16, 2018\n\nThat map is misleading, because it doesn\u2019t show the 38th District, a sliver of which overlaps with the county. In fact, Democrats now control all seven seats that overlap entirely or in part with the county.\n\nHow unusual is that? Quite. The last time that all of Orange County was represented by Democrats, there was only one district in Orange County. By the 1942 election, the sole district was held by a Republican. That was the case for 20 years. In 1962, the county got another district, and the two seats were split. Every 10 years, the districts were redrawn to fit the most recent Census data; every 10 years, the Republicans held most of the seats.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nNotice, though, that this shift in Republican control is not entirely sudden. In the 2002 elections, the Democrats won the then-47th District. Ten years later, they controlled three. Now, all seven.\n\nThat shift mirrors the county\u2019s record in presidential voting. One reason that Orange County was being watched closely on election night this year was that it, for the first time in 80 years, had backed the Democrat over the Republican in the presidential race. Not only that, but the county also voted more heavily Democratic than the nation on the whole, something that it didn\u2019t do in the landslide 1936 contest.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nSolidly Republican, birthplace of Richard Nixon \u2014 and then, starting in the 1980s, consistently less so. It wasn\u2019t the 2018 election that turned Orange County blue, really. It was time.\n\nSo what changed? Well, for one thing, the demographics did.\n\nIn 1980, the county was 78 percent non-Hispanic white. Fewer than 300,000 Hispanic people lived there, along with another 100,000 or so people of Asian descent. Both of those latter populations grew as the former declined. By 2010, the county was majority-minority, and nearly as many Hispanic people lived there as whites.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe change in the demography of Orange County can be seen more readily if we look at the change as a percentage of the population in 1980. The Hispanic population soared; the white population eroded.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThis is not, as we\u2019ve noted before, a necessarily correlated pattern, the decrease in the white population and the increase in Democratic political support. But here the correlation is pretty clear, looking at the elections closest to each Census.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nLosing every seat in a traditionally red county isn\u2019t great for the Republicans, certainly.

Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee but plans to head the Finance Committee in the next Congress. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) announced Friday that he will give up the chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee next year in favor of assuming the top spot on the Senate Finance panel \u2014 a move that will probably put the Judiciary gavel in the hands of Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), once one of President Trump\u2019s harshest critics, but lately one of his closest allies in Congress.\n\nGraham has announced his intention to run for chairman, though he has not officially been selected as the next head of the panel. In a tweet Friday, he said that, if selected, \u201cI will push for the appointment and Senate confirmation of highly qualified conservative judges to the federal bench and aggressive oversight of the Department of Justice and FBI.\u201d\n\nThe GOP has been confirming record numbers of conservative judges \u2014 including two Supreme Court justices \u2014 to the federal courts, a pursuit Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) identified as the party\u2019s top priority.\n\n[Republicans turn Kavanaugh into an election-year rallying cry]\n\nGraham emerged as a firebrand champion of the effort during a Judiciary panel hearing on sexual assault accusations against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, in which Graham angrily dismissed the allegations and proceedings as \u201ccrap,\u201d a \u201ccharade\u201d and \u201cthe most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics.\u201d\n\nBut judges are not the only matter that will be on the Judiciary Committee\u2019s agenda next year. Early on, the panel will probably have to consider a nominee to become attorney general, after Trump fired Jeff Sessions from the post and appointed his former chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker, to serve as acting attorney general.\n\nThe committee also will probably have to oversee special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for Whitaker\u2019s recusal from that investigation because of past statements he has made dismissing it, but Graham has refused to join their number. After a meeting with Whitaker on Thursday, Graham said he was \u201cnot buying into this hysteria\u201d over Whitaker\u2019s appointment, adding that Whitaker is \u201cnot going to do anything draconian\u201d to Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\n[The legal fight over Matthew Whitaker\u2019s appointment, explained]\n\nGraham has moved closer to Trump over the course of his presidency, even endorsing the creation of a second special counsel to investigate charges that bias and unprofessionalism affected the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s investigations of Trump\u2019s campaign and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. But the sharp-tongued senator has also been a stalwart defender of Mueller\u2019s probe, cautioning the president against making any moves to undermine it and even co-authoring a bill to put any decision to fire a special counsel to the courts.\n\nEarlier this week, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said that he would not vote to advance any of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees until the special counsel protection bill received a vote on the Senate floor. Graham said Thursday that he would like to see Flake get that vote.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that Mueller\u2019s in jeopardy . . . but from a policy point of view, I think this is good policy, no matter who the special counsel is,\u201d Graham said Thursday.\n\n[Trump endorses bipartisan criminal-justice reform bill]\n\nAs chairman, Graham will have the authority to launch investigations of the issues surrounding the Russia probe, and, once completed, the work of Mueller\u2019s probe. Graham also will be in a position to push forward legislation on other matters he has advocated, such as criminal-justice reform, if it fails to pass this year.\n\nOn Thursday, Graham said that if the Senate voted on the bill now, \u201cI think you\u2019d get 80 votes.\u201d He added that he hoped Congress would pass such legislation this year so lawmakers could avoid starting from scratch at the beginning of next year.\n\nGrassley had the option of staying on as Judiciary chairman next year, under Senate Republican rules that limit senators from serving as panel leaders for more than six years. But he opted to move back to the Finance Committee \u2014 where he has been both chairman and ranking member \u2014 for the next two years.\n\nIn a statement announcing his decision, he said his motivation was to try to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on the improved economy, \u201cto make sure that as many Americans as possible get to experience this good economy for themselves.\u201d Grassley listed tax policy, small-business investment opportunities, expanded market access for farmers and manufacturers, and expanded health-care access for rural communities among his top priorities as chairman.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always more that can be done to help make life better for and empower every individual and family,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Alyssa Rosenberg", "title": "What the women of \u2018My Brilliant Friend\u2019 tell us about the men of \u2018The Godfather\u2019", "description": "\"The Godfather\" is a masterpiece about men. \"My Brilliant Friend\" shows us just how much is happening to the women at the margins.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2018/11/16/what-the-women-of-my-brilliant-friend-tell-us-about-the-men-of-the-godfather/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tMaQeWpNc57VNvhlk-XqXo7-Ugc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4LFL4WOXXM6B5MT3LTJEVM5WDQ.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:43:02Z", "content": "This piece discusses some of the plot details of My Brilliant Friend, but man oh man is the mood more the point than the plot here.

From these few brief scenes, you\u2019d never know that Lucy is a fully developed character in Mario Puzo\u2019s novel of the same name: She helps set up the Corleone family operations in Las Vegas, and the book explores her grief after Sonny\u2019s assassination and her journey back to romantic and sexual happiness.\n\nI think about Lucy Mancini a lot, not so much because her story is a major loss to movie history, but because she represents the women in the margins who bear the consequences of the main character\u2019s decisions. And she was never on my mind so frequently as when I watched HBO\u2019s adaptation of \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d the first novel in Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan quartet, which debuts on Nov. 18. It would be a disservice to \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d to treat it as a mere addendum to \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d But watching the movie series and the miniseries together is a powerful testament to what we gain when we see the world both from the center and the margins.\n\n\u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d follows Elena Greco (Elisa del Genio as a child, Margherita Mazzucco as a teenager) and Raffaella Cerullo (Ludovica Nasti and later Gaia Girace) through their youths in a tenement neighborhood in postwar Naples. Their district is dominated by a loan shark (Antonio Pennarella) and the Solara family, who profited from the black market during World War II. Elena, known as Len\u00f9, and Raffaella, who goes by Lila, are outstanding students \u2014 Lila through native genius and Len\u00f9 through hard work \u2014 and the series explores the ways in which their intelligence might allow them to escape the Neapolitan cycle of poverty, even as their gifts separate them from their peers and from each other.\n\nLives like Len\u00f9\u2019s and Lila\u2019s are incidental in the cinematic world of \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d shows us the richness and tragedy that lie beyond that male-defined frame.\n\nIn \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d domestic violence is an ugly cog in some larger plot mechanics. Knowing that Sonny\u2019s sister, Connie (Talia Shire), is regularly abused by her husband, Carlo (Gianni Russo), the family\u2019s enemies instigate a brawl between them as part of a plot to lure Sonny out of the family compound and murder him.\n\nWhere Carlo is an up-jumped schemer and a tool in larger plots, \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d paints a deeper and more disturbing portrait of intimate violence. Len\u00f9\u2019s mother, Immacolata (Annarita Vitolo), furious that her daughter might escape the drudgery of housework and child care that has defined her own life, goads Len\u00f9\u2019s father, Vittorio (Luca Gallone), by saying he isn\u2019t enough of a man to hit his daughter properly. Even as Vittorio beats Len\u00f9, he insists to Immacolata that the girl will go to school. He\u2019s strong enough to insist that his daughter be given a chance at a better life, but too weak to refuse to beat that same child. Lila\u2019s father (Antonio Buonanno) is even weaker: He throws Lila out a window when she demands to go to middle school, then blames the child he\u2019s left bleeding in the street for provoking him.\n\nLove, sex and romance also carry different risks for the men of \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and the women of \u201cMy Brilliant Friend.\u201d In \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d affection for women risks making men weak. Sonny is undone by his affection for his sister and his need to defend her. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) must put aside his feelings for Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) to avenge his father.\n\nBut in \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d catching the eye of one of the Solara brothers is a deadly dangerous business for the girl involved. Marcello (Elvis Esposito) and Michele (Alessio Gallo) prowl the streets of Naples, pulling girls into their sleek car and assaulting and humiliating them. Their behavior is exactly the sort of transgression that a meek Italian immigrant describes in the iconic opening scene of \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d when he begs Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) to avenge his daughter. The young woman had been beaten and disfigured by her boyfriend, who is \u201cnot an Italian,\u201d and by the young man\u2019s friends. Don Corleone\u2019s pledge to mete out justice introduces him to the audience as someone much greater than a common thug. The scene also presents such brutal violations of young women as essentially American behavior; \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d is a piercing testament that violent machismo knows no nationality.\n\nWhen Michael Corleone is \u201chit by the thunderbolt\u201d when he glimpses Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli) in the Italian countryside in \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d it\u2019s presented as a sort of meet cute that leads to a respectful courtship and their marriage. For girls in \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d to become the object of the Solaras\u2019 intentions is to risk incineration by that same lightning. Michael and Sonny Corleone are the tragic heroes of their story; \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d is an unnerving reminder that they could easily have been the villains of someone else\u2019s narrative.\n\nAnd \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d illustrates that behind the great fortunes of families such as the Corleones lie not merely great crimes, but crimes that are no less devastating for their small scale. \u201cThe Godfather\u201d shows us the establishment of drug cartels, the shifts of power in the casino business and the Corleones\u2019 efforts to manipulate Hollywood. \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d tallies the cost to the Peluso family, who lost their carpentry shop to loan sharking, and their father, Alfred (Gennaro Canonico), to prison after he is framed for murder by the Solaras.\n\nBy some of the cruder metrics in use in today\u2019s cultural discourse, it might be tempting to use these differences to declare \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d morally superior to \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d and thus to anoint it the better piece of art. That would be overreach, both on critical and political grounds.\n\nCoppola\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThe Godfather\u201d is one of the greatest movies of all time. And it is better-remembered than Puzo\u2019s novel because of the judicious edits the screenplay makes to the book: Lucy Mancini\u2019s story is a female window into the Corleone family, but her story is also influenced by midcentury sexual attitudes that make it remarkably dated. \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d by contrast, is sometimes slowed down by its fidelity to Ferrante\u2019s novel, particularly in its preservation of voice over narration from Len\u00f9\u2019s perspective.\n\nFortunately, one of the ways out of the traps of contemporary cultural conversation is to recognize that we don\u2019t have to choose between these two remarkable pieces of art. Both stories \u2014 the portrayal of the Italian American struggle to assimilate in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and the portrait of Italian women clawing toward freedom and self-actualization in \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d \u2014 contain their own powerful truths. Watching them together isn\u2019t a competition. The degradation and poverty that define \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d show us just how far the Corleones came. And the indifference men show to women in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d shows us just how hard Len\u00f9 and Lila will have to fight to escape."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange faces charges under seal - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange faces charges under seal Washington Post WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department has filed charges under seal against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, a person familiar with the matter confirmed Friday after prose\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/court-filing-hints-at-possible-charges-for-wikileaks-founder/2018/11/16/d0cf1382-e96e-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:40:08Z", "content": "WASHINGTON The Justice Department has filed charges under seal against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, a person familiar with the matter confirmed Friday after prosecutors inadvertently tipped off the information in a court filing.

The Justice Department inadvertently named Assange in a court filing in an unrelated case that raised immediate questions about whether the WikiLeaks founder had been charged under seal. Assange\u2019s name appears twice in an August 2018 filing from a prosecutor in Virginia in a separate case involving a man accused of coercing a minor. (Frank Augstein, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will not willingly travel to the United States to face charges filed under seal against him, one of his lawyers said Friday, foreshadowing a possible fight over extradition for a central figure in the U.S. special counsel\u2019s Russia-Trump investigation.\n\nAssange, who has taken cover in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been granted asylum, has speculated publicly for years that the Justice Department had brought secret criminal charges against him for revealing highly sensitive government information on his website.\n\nThat hypothesis appeared closer to reality after prosecutors, in an errant court filing in an unrelated case, inadvertently revealed the existence of sealed charges. The filing, discovered Thursday night, said the charges and arrest warrant \u201cwould need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\u201d\n\nA person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity because the case had not been made public, confirmed that charges had been filed under seal. The exact charges Assange faces and when they might be unsealed remained uncertain Friday.\n\nAny charges against him could help illuminate whether Russia coordinated with the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 presidential election. They also would suggest that, after years of internal Justice Department wrangling, prosecutors have decided to take a more aggressive tack against WikiLeaks.\n\nA criminal case also holds the potential to expose the practices of a radical transparency activist who has been under U.S. government scrutiny for years and at the center of some of the most explosive disclosures of stolen information in the last decade.\n\nThose include thousands of diplomatic cables from Army Pvt. Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, secret CIA hacking tools, and most recently and notoriously, Democratic emails that were published in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election and that U.S. intelligence officials say had been hacked by Russia.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller, who has already charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with hacking, has been investigating whether any Trump associates had advance knowledge of the stolen emails.\n\nAssange could be an important link for Mueller as he looks to establish exactly how WikiLeaks came to receive the emails, and why its dump of stolen communications from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta \u2014 beginning just after a damaging video of Trump from a decade earlier publicly surfaced \u2014 appeared timed to boost the Trump campaign.\n\nAssange, 47, has resided in the Ecuadorian Embassy under a grant of asylum for more than six years to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where he was accused of sex crimes, or to the United States, whose government he has repeatedly humbled with mass disclosures of classified information.\n\nThe Australian was once a welcome guest at the embassy, which takes up part of the ground floor of a stucco-fronted apartment in London\u2019s posh Knightsbridge neighborhood. But his relationship with his hosts has soured over the years amid reports of espionage, erratic behavior and diplomatic unease.\n\nBarry Pollack, a Washington lawyer for Assange, said he expected Ecuador to \u201ccomply with its obligations\u201d to preserve asylum for him, though he acknowledged a concern that the county could revoke his asylum, expel him from the embassy and facilitate an extradition to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe burden should not shift to Mr. Assange to have to defend against criminal charges when what he has been accused of doing is what journalists do every day,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cThey publish truthful information because the public has a right to know and consider that information and understand what its government and institutions are doing.\u201d\n\nThe charges came to light in an unrelated court filing from a federal prosecutor in Virginia, who was attempting to keep sealed a separate case involving a man accused of coercing a minor for sex.\n\nThe three-page filing contained two references to Assange, including one sentence that said \u201cdue to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Assange\u2019s name was included in the document. Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the Justice Department\u2019s Eastern District of Virginia said, \u201cThe court filing was made in error. That was not the intended name for this filing.\u201d\n\nThe filing was discovered by Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, who posted it on Twitter hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department was preparing to prosecute Assange.\n\nThe case at issue concerns a defendant named Seitu Sulayman Kokayi, a 29-year-old teacher who has since been indicted on charges of enticing a 15-year-old girl to commit sex acts and to produce child pornography. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any connection between Assange and Kokayi.\n\nThe since-unsealed document, a motion filed in late August, mentions Assange in two boilerplate sections, suggesting a copy-and-paste error or that his name was inadvertently left in a template used for the common filings.\n\nThe filing suggests prosecutors have reason to believe they will be able to arrest and extradite Assange.\n\nEcuadorian officials say they have cut off his high-speed internet access and will restore it only if he agrees to stop interfering in the affairs of Ecuador\u2019s partners, such as the U.S. and Spain. He is allowed to use the embassy\u2019s WiFi, though it is unclear if he doing so. Officials have also imposed a series of other restrictions on Assange\u2019s activities and visitors, and ordered him to clean after his cat.\n\nCarlos Poveda, Assange\u2019s lawyer in Ecuador, said he suspects Ecuador has been maneuvering to kick Assange out of the embassy through the stricter new living requirements it recently imposed.\n\nHe said possible U.S. charges, however, are proof his client remains under threat, and he called on Ecuador\u2019s government to uphold Assange\u2019s asylum protections. He said Ecuador would be responsible if anything happened to Assange.\n\nWith shrinking options \u2014 an Ecuadorian lawsuit seeking to reverse the restrictions was recently turned down \u2014 WikiLeaks announced in September that former spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, an Icelandic journalist who has long served as one of Assange\u2019s lieutenants, would take over as editor-in-chief.\n\nIn a brief interview in Reykjavik, Iceland, Hrafnsson called the U.S. news \u201ca very black day for journalism.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Raphael Satter in Paris, Chad Day in Washington and Egill Bjarnason in Iceland contributed to this report.\n\nLink to court filing: http://apne.ws/Me9YxB9\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Wheeler took the helm in early July after Scott Pruitt resigned amid mounting ethics scandals.\n\nDuring his brief tenure as the EPA\u2019s acting chief, Wheeler has proved far different from the man he replaced. Where Pruitt was a politician who appeared to enjoy the limelight and trappings of Cabinet life, Wheeler has long worked behind the scenes on energy and environmental policy and generally avoids public attention.

Those proposals, along with moves to change the way the agency calculates the health benefits of new air-pollution standards, have sparked sharp criticism from environmental and public health groups.\n\nBut Wheeler also has struck a more conciliatory tone with career employees at the agency, emphasizing that he once served in their ranks and that he values their service.

He won approval for his current job in April on a 53-to-45 vote, with three Democrats supporting his nomination. At the time, several Democratic senators questioned his past work for Murray Energy, one of the nation\u2019s biggest coal companies, as well as mining companies and other energy interests.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), said in a statement that he will evaluate how Wheeler has performed in recent months before deciding whether to back his nomination.\n\n\u201cIf the president intends to nominate Andrew Wheeler to be the Administrator of EPA,\u201d Carper said, \u201cthen Mr. Wheeler must come before our committee so that members can look at his record as acting administrator objectively to see if any improvements have been made at the agency since he took the helm.\u201d\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), was less diplomatic.\n\n\u201cI hoped Scott Pruitt\u2019s policy dirty work would dry up after he left the EPA in disgrace, but proposals like the forthcoming rule to weaken or eliminate protections against mercury emissions make it clear Andrew Wheeler plans to continue \u2026 with rollbacks of vital environmental protections,\u201d Whitehouse said in a statement.\n\nEnvironmentalist activists also were quick to criticize the idea of Wheeler as EPA chief.\n\n\u201cIn normal times, a zealous fossil fuel apologist and the top official in charge of protecting children\u2019s health from pollution would be two separate people with conflicting agendas,\u201d said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group. \u201cBut this is the Trump administration, where a former top coal lobbyist could become administrator of the EPA.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Correction: Argentina-G20-Security story", "description": "Correction: Argentina-G20-Security story", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/correction-argentina-g20-security-story/2018/11/16/9e0a7226-e9d6-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:34:22Z", "content": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina In a story Nov. 15 about bombings in Argentina, The Associated Press misspelled the police chiefs family name as Roncaglica.

Mueller III\u2019s investigation into the Russia scandal is officially over.\n\nThe president himself might not quite realize it yet, and he probably doesn\u2019t understand why it happened. But he has lost that conflict, and the reason is simple: His attempts to fight Mueller were so ham-handed and so public that it made it impossible for him and his administration to shut Mueller down.\n\nThe president is simply incapable of subtlety and judges everything by how it plays out in the media. But in this case, the more attention he drew to his rage at Mueller, the greater the consequences of moving against Mueller became. And now it\u2019s too late.\n\nLook, for example, at the way he handled Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It was precisely because Trump complained publicly so many times that he was livid with Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe \u2014 which made it clear that he wanted Sessions to oversee it so Sessions could shut it down \u2014 that it became impossible to fire Sessions before the midterm elections. Those public statements created a situation where firing Sessions would create a backlash from Republican senators and a huge media scandal, since Trump himself had all but said it would be for the purpose of obstructing justice.\n\nIt was July 2017, sixteen months ago, when Trump told the New York Times that if he had known Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia investigation he never never would have hired him. But it was that very statement that made it so much harder to do what what he wanted and fire Sessions. So months passed while Mueller was diligently working away \u2014 amassing evidence, turning witnesses and handing down indictments \u2014 and Trump could fire Sessions only after the midterms were over.\n\nThen when he finally did it, Trump once again acted without any subtlety or understanding of how his moves would be interpreted publicly, installing Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general likely in no small part because of Whitaker\u2019s apparent hostility to the Mueller investigation. But Whitaker became so controversial so quickly that it\u2019s now impossible for him to fulfill Trump\u2019s wishes without, once again, causing a huge media scandal. Whitaker now seems to feel that his hands are tied on this matter; the AP reports that \u201cWhitaker told Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in a meeting on Thursday that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation will proceed.\u201d\n\nAnd now, Republicans in the Senate are pushing the administration to find a new attorney general who can be confirmed quickly \u2014 which means someone who will pledge in their confirmation hearings not to interfere in the Mueller investigation:\n\nEven after Trump\u2019s latest attack on Mueller in a flurry of tweets Thursday, most Republicans argue the president will not fire Mueller or derail his investigation because the political consequences would be too great. But they said that naming an attorney general nominee as soon as possible \u2014 specifically one who would vow to preserve the Russia probe \u2014 would go a long way in halting legislative momentum to protect Mueller and Democratic messaging that acting attorney general Matt Whitaker will undermine the investigation. \u201cIf we had some confidence that there is somebody nominated that would be confirmed in a reasonable period of time, to me it seems like it would relieve a lot of the controversy,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, who predicted that Whitaker, who was openly critical of the Mueller probe before Trump tapped him for the job, is \u201cnot going to be there long.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, all indications are that after a long period of silence during the close of the midterm campaign, Mueller is about to do something big, or a series of somethings. Trump\u2019s former factotum Michael Cohen was spotted Monday coming to Washington with one of his criminal defense lawyers. Paul Manafort has held multiple meetings in recent weeks with Mueller\u2019s team. On Wednesday, Mueller asked the court to delay sentencing for former Trump aide Rick Gates, saying Gates \u201ccontinues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations.\u201d Trump\u2019s orbit is reportedly gripped by anxiety about what\u2019s coming.\n\nWhen Trump lashes out on Twitter in increasingly hysterical terms as he did Thursday, it might (as many have speculated) suggest that he knows something bad is coming his way. But his anger comes from impotence. If he knew he was about to get his way with Mueller, he wouldn\u2019t be shouting about it on Twitter. It\u2019s the fact that he can\u2019t do anything about it that fills him with rage.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how many more Trump aides will wind up serving time behind bars, what Mueller\u2019s final conclusions will be or how much the president himself will be implicated in the scandal. What we do know is that Trump wanted to stop the investigation, and not only has he failed, he has made everything worse for himself."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Ian Livingston", "title": "Here\u2019s how half a foot of snow led to a commuting nightmare in New York City Thursday", "description": "Poorly-timed heavy snow turned rush hour into total traffic chaos.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2018/11/16/heres-how-half-foot-snow-led-commuting-nightmare-new-york-city-thursday/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/B_SfwZsJvix71gyHrVMDioxaUPI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7X7Y36HJLQI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:14:35Z", "content": "Traffic in New York City and its surroundings came to a standstill Thursday afternoon and evening as a blast of crippling snow swept through the region.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nTraffic in New York City and its surroundings came to a standstill Thursday afternoon and evening as a blast of crippling snow swept through the region. The poorly predicted snowfall led to hundreds of traffic accidents, left some drivers stuck in their cars overnight and stranded children at school. Normally 30-minute commutes turned into 10-hour-long sagas.\n\nThe culprit was the same storm that delivered early-season snow to parts of the South, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. Half a foot of snow came down in New York City, the most so early in the season on record. The 6.4 inches of snowfall recorded in Central Park turned into the second-snowiest November day on record in the city, dating to 1869.\n\nNYC-Central Park's 6.4\" of snow yesterday was the 2nd snowiest October or November day on record.

It was also the biggest November snow event since the 1930s.\n\nDespite growing signals of a major band of snow moving through the city later in the day, the National Weather Service had initially predicted hardly any snow.\n\nPeople in NYC area and Southern New England have right to be upset with snow forecast. Left is forecast from Thursday morning when most people made travel decisions. NYC, Philly & Hartford all ended up with 3x more than expected. Midday forecast went WAY up but too late to help pic.twitter.com/Sa787KYBMN \u2014 Bill Karins (@BillKarins) November 16, 2018\n\nThe Weather Service forecast issued early Thursday morning called for little to no accumulation. Its afternoon prediction increased the amounts to several inches, but that was also an underestimate.\n\nReasons for the rapid forecast shift are numerous, but the primary one was the realization that a supersized snow band was about to plow into air that was colder than anticipated.\n\n\u201c[T]he \u2018front-end thump\u2019 of heavy snowfall is owed to something called frontogenesis,\u201d wrote Capital Weather Gang\u2019s Matthew Cappucci several hours before the snowfall began. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a tightening of horizontal temperature gradients in the atmosphere. When a big change of temperatures exists over a short distance, it can boost precipitation rates substantially.\u201d\n\nIn this case, snow that began in New York City midafternoon quickly turned heavy heading toward sunset and beyond. Temperatures that had been above freezing dropped into the upper 20s in heavy snow, and eventually snow transitioned to a wintry mix in the evening. This cement-like wintry mix included denser sleet.\n\nTraffic still at a standstill in much of NYC at 11pm EST. Strangely, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island doing much better than the rest of the region. Less snow because they changed to rain sooner? pic.twitter.com/LnBQI413uU \u2014 Jeff Frame (@VORTEXJeff) November 16, 2018\n\nQuestions of forecasts and lack of preparation aside, a primary cause of the commuting nightmare in and around the city was the timing and intensity of the snowfall. Those snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour are difficult for even well-prepared crews to keep up with. Even in situations with little to no traffic, streets would likely become impassable for a time under such conditions.\n\nTurn the biggest city in the country loose under such a scenario, and it\u2019s a perfect recipe for traffic mayhem\n\nSimilar rush-hour nightmares hit Washington in 2011 and 2016. The 2011 event, in particular, shared many similarities to Thursday\u2019s commute in New York. In both cases, first flakes in the midafternoon spurred a mass exodus, filling roads with vehicles. Then pounding snow arrived, and gridlock engulfed the area.\n\nMajor snow-induced commuting disasters have hit U.S. urban centers in recent years \u2014 both north and south \u2014 all from a combination of bad weather and bad timing. Atlanta was hit in 2014. That same year another \u201ccommutageddon\u201d spawned a million memes in Raleigh, N.C.\n\nEven Chicago isn\u2019t immune to the perils of terribly-timed snowflakes, where a storm snarled traffic in February 2011.\n\nManhattan NYC today!

And citizens are then deprived of crucial information they would never know about otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe notion that the federal criminal charges could be brought based on the publication of truthful information is an incredibly dangerous precedent to set,\u201d Assange\u2019s attorney Barry J. Pollack said Friday.\n\nThe background, of course, is that WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from Democrats during the presidential race that were stolen by Russian intelligence officers.\n\nThe big question, Abrams said, is whether Assange not only received the emails but also actually participated in the Russian hack. (Assange\u2019s story is nothing if not weird: He has been holed up in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London for years, initially avoiding Swedish authorities over an investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations.)\n\n\u201cIf he was working with the Russian government,\u201d Abrams said, \u201cwe\u2019re more firmly into what the Espionage Act deals with.\u201d The 1917 act, which has been described as singularly opaque, has been used in recent years to pursue those who leak government secrets and, at times, journalists, too.\n\nAbrams has been drawing a distinction for years between Assange and traditional publishers. In a 2010 Wall Street Journal opinion piece, he called Assange \u201cno boon to American journalists\u201d and criticized him for providing little context or judgment in revealing government secrets.\n\nStill, Abrams sees the dangers for press freedom: \u201cThere\u2019s an inherent tension between the Espionage Act and protecting free speech.\u201d\n\nIt may be that Assange has crossed an important line and deserves prosecution.\n\nBut press rights advocates are justifiably worried.\n\nAssange may not be a journalist, and he may be far from admirable for all kinds of reasons.\n\nBut as Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, wrote on Twitter, \u201cthe prosecution of Wikileaks for publication of classified info \u2014 if that\u2019s the focus of the indictment \u2014 would represent a profound threat to press freedom.\u201d\n\nGranted, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s unknown here. And with the charges against Assange under seal, that may be the case for quite a while.\n\nBut, in the meantime, here\u2019s something to keep in mind:\n\nYou can dislike Assange.\n\nYou can consider him unethical \u2014 a far cry from journalists who apply a rational filter in publishing governments secrets.\n\nYou can be disgusted by the political effects of his publishing the Democratic emails.\n\nBut it would be a mistake to confuse any of that with what\u2019s ultimately good for press freedom in the United States.\n\nFor more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Kirk Cousins's ability to avoid mistakes against the Bears' defense could decide the NFC North - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Kirk Cousins's ability to avoid mistakes against the Bears' defense could decide the NFC North Washington Post First place in the NFC North will be on the line Sunday night when the Chicago Bears host the Minnesota Vikings.

(Bruce Kluckhohn/Associated Press)\n\nFirst place in the NFC North will be on the line Sunday night when the Chicago Bears host the Minnesota Vikings. When the Vikings paid quarterback Kirk Cousins handsomely this offseason, they had meaningful games such as this one in mind.\n\nBut the outcome at Soldier Field could depend not only on how many good things Cousins does, but on how many costly mistakes he avoids. Cousins said he knows the Vikings cannot afford to commit turnovers against a Chicago defense that is adept at forcing them, but can he heed his own cautionary words?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much something we talk about and are aware of,\u201d he said this week. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the biggest statistics to point to as to why the Bears are playing at the level they are. When you create turnovers, that is a critical factor in winning football games. So it\u2019s something we have to be very aware of. I don\u2019t know that I drop back saying, \u2018Don\u2019t fumble, don\u2019t fumble.\u2019 Or, \u2018Don\u2019t throw a pick.\u2019 You still have to play. But you\u2019re just aware that . . . one of the ways they\u2019ve been able to win some football games is by creating turnovers again and again and again.\u201d\n\n[The Vikings were supposed to be an NFC heavyweight with Kirk Cousins. So far, they\u2019re not.]\n\nThe Bears lead the league with 16 interceptions. Their plus-13 turnover differential is the NFL\u2019s best. They have 24 takeaways, good for second, and lead the NFL with 89 points off turnovers. That includes four defensive touchdowns.\n\n\u201cAt this point in the year, it\u2019s not a coincidence,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an anomaly. It\u2019s because they\u2019re a good defense and that\u2019s what they do. So we have to be aware of it. . . . Hopefully we can win the turnover margin, and I think when the game\u2019s over and the dust settles, I\u2019m sure it will be a very telling stat.\u201d\n\nCousins, for the most part, is living up to the enormous expectations created by the fully guaranteed, three-year, $84 million contract that he signed with the Vikings after three straight 4,000-yard passing seasons with the Washington Redskins. He has thrown for 2,685 yards and 17 touchdowns and has a passer rating of 102.2. He is completing 71.3 percent of his passes. And the Vikings, at 5-3-1, are right on the heels of the first-place Bears (6-3).\n\nHe has thrown five interceptions, a modest total, but has also lost six fumbles. He had a reputation with the Redskins, deserved or not, for committing turnovers at inopportune moments. It is one he must shed if the Vikings are to reach the Super Bowl a year after losing in the NFC championship game with Case Keenum at quarterback.\n\n\u201cI think it affects the whole approach,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cThe scheme, the way we line up \u2014 we\u2019re not going to just try to invite them to be able to walk right into interceptions or create strip sacks. We\u2019re going to try to do all we can to make it tough on them and look at the ways they\u2019ve created turnovers and try not to gift them anything, and make them really earn it.\u201d\n\nCousins grew up in the Chicago area as a Bears fan. He can appreciate the prowess of a defense that has been every bit as powerful as was expected when Chicago traded for star pass rusher Khalil Mack, the 2016 defensive player of the year for the Oakland Raiders, before the season. The Bears are fourth in the league in total defense and tied for fourth in scoring defense.\n\n[Is Khalil Mack the next Lawrence Taylor? Bill Belichick and Lawrence Taylor weigh in.]\n\n\u201cBig-time game,\u201d Mack said of the matchup with the Vikings. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make big plays in big-time games. And so it\u2019s going to be another challenge for us, and we\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nAfter missing two games with an ankle injury, Mack celebrated his return to the lineup with a two-sack performance in a 34-22 win against the Detroit Lions last week. He has seven sacks in seven games.\n\n\u201cLike I was telling [outside linebackers coach Brandon] Staley,\u201d Mack said last weekend, \u201cI\u2019ve got to play catch-up, and I\u2019ve got to get to the quarterback as many times as I can. . . . It could have been three, four. I\u2019m just looking forward to next weekend and getting out there again and getting some more wins. And that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nThe Vikings and Bears will play their regular season finale in Minneapolis. These two meetings could determine the division winner.\n\n\u201cIf it takes an extra sense of urgency for a big game, I would say, \u2018What were we doing the other nine games so far?\u2019 \u201d Cousins said. \u201cI\u2019ve never lined up in an NFL game and walked away and felt like we were playing a JV team. . . . The fans may say, \u2018Oh, their record\u2019s bad; we\u2019re going to blow them out.\u2019 That\u2019s just not the NFL. Those people haven\u2019t played in this league and don\u2019t understand how difficult it is. So is there a sense of urgency? Sure.

Wheels churning, machinery whirring, the rover will amble across the rusty terrain, looking for rocks to send back to Earth \u2014 rocks that could prove there once was life on Mars.\n\nIt is the first time in history scientists have had a real shot at addressing one of humanity\u2019s deepest questions: Are we alone?\n\nBut first they must decide where to look.\n\nThere are three options: a former hot spring NASA has visited once before, a dried-up river delta that fed into a crater lake, and a network of ancient mesas that may have hidden layers of underground water.\n\nIn the coming week, after decades of dreaming, years of research and a heated three-day debate at a workshop in Los Angeles last month, NASA\u2019s top science official will choose which spot to explore. The site he selects will set the stage on which generations of scientists probe the mysteries of our existence.\n\nThis rover, scheduled to launch in 2020, is just the first phase of a multibillion-dollar, four-step sample return process. To put pieces of Mars in the hands of scientists will require a lander to retrieve the samples; a probe to bring them home; and then an ultra-secure storage facility that will keep Earth life from contaminating the Mars rocks \u2014 and vice versa.\n\nYet the discovery of fossils in those samples could illuminate the origins of life here on Earth. It could hint at whether someone else is still out there, waiting to be found.\n\n\u201cI want to know,\u201d said Matt Golombek, a NASA scientist charged with guiding the search for a landing site. \u201cDon\u2019t you? I want to know what\u2019s there. I want to know how big an accident we are.\u201d\n\nThat hunger for knowledge is what drew hundreds of people to the recent workshop \u2014 veteran space explorers and aspiring PhDs, an 18-year-old college freshman and an 80-year-old retired accountant \u2014 to assess which plan was best. For days they debated, fueled by curiosity and weak coffee, conscious that the outcome of their meeting could influence NASA and shape history, acutely aware of what they still didn\u2019t know.\n\nSo much about Mars remains a mystery. The very notion of alien life is barely more than an educated guess buoyed by wild hope.\n\nThey are hopeful.\n\nThis composite image of Earth and its moon, as seen from Mars, combines the best Earth image with the best moon image from four sets of images acquired Nov. 20, 2016, by NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona)\n\nA search on a failed planet\n\nOn Earth, microscopic life is inescapable. Biology began here almost 4 billion years ago, when the planet was still being bombarded by debris left over from the formation of the solar system. Today, tiny, tenacious organisms are splashing in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park, flying in clouds, freezing in Antarctica, lurking up to a mile and a half beneath the ground.\n\nIf it could happen here, why not there?\n\nMars has been visited by more than two dozen satellites and rovers, which showed it was not always the desert world we see today. Dormant volcanoes and frozen floods of lava demonstrate that the planet once had an active interior that drove tectonic activity. Empty channels, gullies and lakes suggest that liquid water once lapped at the surface \u2014 which might mean a thicker atmosphere existed to keep the water from boiling away.\n\nBut then disaster struck. Less than a billion years into its history, most experts say, the planet\u2019s molten core stopped churning. This led to the decline of carbon-belching volcanoes and the loss of Mars\u2019s protective magnetic field. Cosmic radiation and energetic particles from the sun stripped away the planet\u2019s atmosphere, causing any water on the surface to evaporate. Goodbye, ocean; so long, lakes; farewell to moist soils and bubbling volcanic vents \u2014 all the kinds of places that life likes to live.\n\nNow Mars is seen as a \u201cfailed planet,\u201d a frightening alternate-reality version of the world we inhabit.\n\nThe delta in the Eberswalde crater on Mars.

(NASA/JPL/MSSS) This October 2001 image shows the Mississippi River Delta. (Jesse Allen/NASA)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Earth where the Earth environments went away,\u201d Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at Caltech, said at the workshop. \u201cSo the question is, why? And when?\u201d And, most momentous of all, \u201cDid life have a chance to get going before then?\u201d\n\nThose questions can be answered only by bringing Mars rocks back to Earth, most scientists say. A human in a top-tier lab would be able to analyze the samples atom by atom, revealing tiny structures a robot couldn\u2019t see.\n\nThe detection of even a few ragged molecules left by a microbe would be historic. Knowing that biology arose on two neighboring planets would suggest that life is common throughout the universe. The environment where the Martians are found \u2014 be it a hot spring, a river delta or an underground refuge \u2014 might provide a clue to where life on Earth originated.\n\nAnd the knowledge that a world could harbor life and then fail would underscore our own unbelievable good fortune. The conditions for Earthlings\u2019 continued existence may not always be so assured.\n\n\u201cWe have to get those samples, and they have to be the right ones,\u201d Golombek said.\n\nIn the back of the ballroom, one researcher turned to the person next to her and grinned: \u201cAre you ready for the showdown?\u201d\n\n2. Jezero Crater 3. Northeast Syrtis 1. Columbia Hills 2. Jezero Crater 3. Northeast Syrtis 1. Columbia Hills\n\nColumbia Hills: Former hot spring\n\nOption one for the mission is a field of Yellowstone-like hot springs explored by the rover Spirit between 2004 and 2010. Here, beside a rocky outcrop called Home Plate, the now-defunct rover uncovered strange, fingerlike structures made of silica, a mineral associated with water and life. But the rover wasn\u2019t equipped with instruments capable of detecting complex organic compounds, so the mystery of these structures went unsolved.\n\nSeven years later, Spirit instrument operator Steve Ruff received an unlikely epiphany via volcanology journal: Scientists had discovered an otherworldly geyser field in the Andes that contained structures just like the ones on Mars. At the site, called El Tatio, heat-loving microorganisms produce silica deposits in filaments, mats and spires.\n\n\u201cThis is the place that is the most Mars-like of any setting I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Ruff said.\n\nBut revisiting a site might mean there\u2019s less to learn, many scientists worry. And what if Ruff is wrong about the silica structures?\n\nRuff\u2019s only reply: \u201cWhat if we\u2019re right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf one of the drivers of exploring Mars is to answer this question, \u2018Are we alone?\u2019 and we find a place that could address that question and we turn away from it because it\u2019s not guaranteed that we\u2019re going to find it, I think that\u2019s just \u2014 \u201d He paused, searching for a term that wouldn\u2019t offend any of his colleagues. \u201cA conservatism,\u201d he said finally. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just not characteristic of NASA.\u201d\n\nThis site near Mars\u2019s equator was explored between 2004 and 2010 by the rover Spirit.\n\nThis site near Mars's equator was explored between 2004 and 2010 by the rover Spirit.

Debris from ancient meteorite impacts, called \u201cmega breccias,\u201d would be some of the oldest rocks sampled from any planet in the solar system. Rocks a billion years younger could reveal how Mars became the world it is today.\n\nThe area also boasts minerals, like carbonates, that suggest it once harbored an underground aquifer \u2014 a potential refuge for organisms seeking protection from their planet\u2019s harsh and erratic climate.\n\nBut if subsurface life was sparse, even the most sophisticated laboratory instruments on Earth might not be able to detect it. Scientists are more accustomed to looking for life in sedimentary rocks like those at Jezero.\n\nThen Emily Lakdawalla, a geologist and senior editor for the Planetary Society, posed a question that loomed over every site being considered.\n\n\u201cWhat if the samples don\u2019t get returned?\u201d she said. \u201cAre we allowed to think about that?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause as people contemplated the possibility. NASA has not yet funded any of the three follow-up missions that are required for sample return.\n\nGolombek took the microphone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to ground rule that out for this conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all depends if you\u2019re an optimist or a pessimist, right?\u201d\n\nFor the moment, he urged his colleagues, be optimists.\n\nNortheast Syrtis is a region of volcanic rock that may once have harbored underground water.\n\nJezero Crater Detail LANDING AREA SYRTIS MAJOR 5 MILES The towering mesas contain rocks that are thought to contain carbonate and olivine, two kinds of minerals of interest in the search for alien life.

Some scientists said their minds changed with every presentation, their opinions ping-ponging as they heard compelling evidence from supporters of each site. Others had become more entrenched in their positions.\n\nBut what if they didn\u2019t have to choose?\n\nThe mission project science team had conceived an ambitious extended mission centered around a new landing location on the edge of Northeast Syrtis called \u201cMidway,\u201d not far from the rim of Jezero Crater.\n\nIt would take hundreds of Martian days \u2014 the equivalent of several years on Earth \u2014 but the rover could conceivably make its way from one site to the other, obtaining the best samples from both. The traverse would carry the rover across steep mountain ridges, crowded rock fields and perilous windswept terrain.\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly grand exploration,\u201d said Ken Williford, deputy project scientist for the mission.\n\nEven by Mars standards, Midway was rife with unknowns. Scientists had not been able to conduct detailed analyses of the rocks it contains, and the proposed 15 mile traverse was at the edge of what could be achieved by a lumbering rover.\n\nThere were a lot of ways this could end badly, some worried.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d project scientist Ken Farley countered, \u201cthere is more than one way to fail.\u201d\n\n\u201cPersonally,\u201d he continued, \u201cI don\u2019t want to fail because we have not been ambitious enough to make the sample cache scientifically worthy.\u201d\n\nThe vote was held in hushed silence; there was barely a murmur as the results were projected onto the ballrooms screens. Columbia Hills had received relatively low ratings. But Jezero, Northeast Syrtis and Midway were neck and neck and neck.\n\nThis mosaic of Mars is a compilation of images captured by the Viking Orbiter 1.

(NASA/USGS)\n\nMaking history\n\nIn the end, the decision would come down to Thomas Zurbuchen.\n\nAs NASA\u2019s associate administrator for science, he oversees more than 100 missions aimed at understanding the solar system and beyond. But of all of those efforts, he said, Mars 2020 is where NASA has the most to lose \u2014 and humanity has the most to gain.\n\n\u201cThis is the riskiest,\u201d he said of the $2 billion mission. \u201cBut suppose everything goes exactly as we hoped. . . . The landing site that I\u2019m the deciding official on will make history.\u201d\n\nDays before he was scheduled to receive his final briefing on the landing site options, Zurbuchen remained undecided. He had attended part of the landing site workshop, but there was still so much to consider: engineers\u2019 safety assessments, the potential for follow-up missions, the need to balance astrobiology research with other scientific questions.\n\nAnd then there was the vision that filled his mind when he closed his eyes to dream \u2014 a consideration that wasn\u2019t financial or scientific, but pure hope. A probe carrying the Mars samples hurtling back toward Earth. Scientists retrieving the cache and getting their first glimpse at the pieces of another planet. The lab where the rocks will be analyzed, the complex instruments that will seek out signs of ancient organisms.\n\nAnd a science classroom where his future grandchildren sit, reading a textbook that bears the name of the place he chose \u2014 a place where humanity learned, for the first time, we have not always been alone.\n\nA 58-foot-tall Black Brant IX sounding rocket launches from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on Oct. 4, the first test of the Mars 2020 mission\u2019s Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research Experiment, or ASPIRE.

A Russian Soyuz rocket has put a cargo ship en route to the International Space Station, clearing the way for the next crewed mission. (Roscosmos Space Agency Press Service photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 A Russian Soyuz rocket sent a cargo ship on its way to the International Space Station on Friday, a successful launch that cleared the way for the next crew to travel to the space outpost.\n\nThe launch of the Russian Progress MS-10 resupply ship from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan marked the fourth successful liftoff of a Soyuz since a launch with crew members had to be aborted last month.\n\nA Soyuz-FG rocket carrying NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos\u2019 Alexei Ovchinin failed two minutes into its flight on Oct. 11, activating an automatic rescue system that allowed their capsule to land safely. A Russian investigation attributed the failure to a sensor that was damaged during the rocket\u2019s final assembly.\n\nThe accident was the first aborted crew launch for the Russian space program since 1983, when two Soviet cosmonauts jettisoned after a launch pad explosion and also had a safe landing. The Russian Soyuz spacecraft is currently the only vehicle that can ferry crews to the space station.\n\nSince the October mishap, two Soyuz rockets were launched successfully from Plesetsk in northwestern Russia, while a third lifted off from French Guiana carrying satellites into orbit. They were of a different subtype than the rocket that failed in October, but the one that lifted off Friday was the same version.\n\nThe Progress ship is set to dock at the space station Sunday, delivering almost three tons of food, fuel, water and other supplies to the crew \u2014 NASA\u2019s Serena Aunon-Chancellor, Russian Sergei Prokopyev and German Alexander Gerst.\n\nIn a separate supply mission, Northrop Grumman\u2019s Antares rocket with Cygnus cargo spacecraft is scheduled to lift off Saturday and dock at the station Monday.\n\nThe current crew is scheduled to return to Earth next month after the arrival of their replacements. American astronaut Anne McClain, Canadian David Saint-Jacques and Russian Oleg Kononenko are set to go up on Dec. 3.\n\nSpeaking Thursday at the Star City space training center outside Moscow, McClain voiced confidence in the Soyuz despite October\u2019s aborted launch.\n\n\u201cWe trust our rocket. We\u2019re ready to fly,\u201d she said. \u201cI think what we learned from the inside in October was how safe this rocket was. A lot of people called it an accident or an incident, or maybe want to use it as an example of not being safe. But for us it\u2019s exactly the opposite because our friends came home, the systems worked and they worked exactly as they were designed.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

An official close to Bennett, whose party holds three cabinet posts, said it had become clear that \u201cthere was a need to go to elections as soon as possible.\u201d The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing deliberations, cited the decision of Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon to veto Bennett\u2019s taking over the role.\n\n[Israel\u2019s hawkish defense minister resigns from the government over Hamas truce]\n\nAnalysts have long speculated that Netanyahu would call early elections to win a new mandate as allegations of corruption and the potential for indictments drew close. However, his popularity has taken a blow in recent days because of what some see as a soft stance toward Gaza. Israelis from border communities near the territory demonstrated in Tel Aviv on Thursday night, expressing anger over the cease-fire with Hamas, which came after militant factions in the Palestinian enclave fired more than 450 rockets toward Israel in the worst bout of cross-border violence since the 2014 war.\n\nSome 74 percent of Israelis are dissatisfied with Netanyahu\u2019s handling of Gaza, according to a snap poll by Israel Television News. The poll suggests that Netanyahu\u2019s Likud would win the most seats in the parliament if elections were held today, but would drop to 29 seats vs. its current 32.\n\n[Palestinian factions say Gaza cease-fire reached after worst fighting since 2014 war]\n\nWith his popularity dented, it appeared that Netanyahu might be trying to forestall early elections. In a statement, his office said that he stressed to Bennett the importance of making every effort to preserve the right-wing government. He emphasized that it was crucial not to repeat the mistakes of 1992, when left-wing Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin won elections after the right-wing coalition government collapsed.\n\nNetanyahu will hold talks with the leaders of the coalition early next week, the statement said. The working week begins Sunday in Israel.\n\n\u201cHe hopes the ministers will act responsibly and not make a historic mistake,\u201d it added.\n\nHowever, it looks as though Netanyahu will have little choice but to call early elections. The official close to Bennett said an election date would be coordinated among coalition partners Sunday. There must be a window of at least 90 days between elections being called and then held.\n\n[Israel\u2019s Netanyahu questioned again in corruption probe]\n\nLiberman\u2019s withdrawal from the government this week left Netanyahu with a slim one-seat majority in the 120-seat Israeli parliament, the Knesset. If Bennett also pulls out, Netanyahu loses his majority.\n\nUpon his resignation Wednesday, Liberman cited Israel\u2019s decision to allow a $15 million cash donation by Qatar to Gaza as another \u201cturning point\u201d for him. Netanyahu has been under pressure to alleviate the security situation in the south after regular flare-ups, most notably weekly demonstrations at the border fence, urged on by Hamas, and incendiary kites launched into Israel.\n\nThe cash was sent as part of a deal that would see Hamas stop demonstrators from approaching the fence and sending flaming kites in exchange for an expanded Gaza fishing zone and internationally funded development projects to improve the humanitarian situation for the territory\u2019s 2 million residents.\n\nGaza has faced stifling Israeli trade rules for more than a decade, with the movement of its residents also severely limited. Egypt also imposes tight restrictions on its border with Gaza.\n\n[Israel-Hamas fighting erupted just as negotiations advanced. What started it, and why does it matter?]\n\nThe prospects for a deal between Hamas and Israel looked like they were dramatically unraveling Sunday, however, after a botched Israeli operation into Gaza resulted in the death of a Hamas commander and six other militants. Factions in Gaza vowed revenge and began a rocket barrage as the Israeli military pounded targets inside the strip.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the criticism Netanyahu has faced will affect policy on Gaza. His office has said he will take over the position of defense minister.\n\nGiven that fact, \u201cthere is no reason to believe there will be any dramatic change in policy,\u201d said Tal Shalev, a senior political correspondent for the Israeli news website Walla. The Israeli military also advocates quelling Gaza through nonmilitary means as it remains more focused on threats on the northern border, she said.\n\nHowever, the situation is volatile, and if there is another escalation, Netanyahu might submit to public pressure, Shalev said.\n\n\u201cPublic opinion is boiling at the policy of containment,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there is an escalation, then Netanyahu may not be able to continue to convince the public that a cease-fire is the best option.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Carol D.

While screening for a new babysitter, Battaglia started using Predictim, an online service that claims to use \u201cadvanced artificial intelligence\u201d to assess a sitter\u2019s risk of drug abuse, bullying or having a \u201cbad attitude.\u201d (Kyle Grillot for The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Jessie Battaglia started looking for a new babysitter for her 1-year-old son, she wanted more information than she could get from a criminal-background check, parent comments and a face-to-face interview.\n\nSo she turned to Predictim, an online service that uses \u201cadvanced artificial intelligence\u201d to assess a babysitter\u2019s personality, and aimed its scanners at one candidate\u2019s thousands of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram posts.\n\nThe system offered an automated \u201crisk rating\u201d of the 24-year-old woman, saying she was at a \u201cvery low risk\u201d of being a drug abuser. But it gave a slightly higher risk assessment \u2014 a 2 out of 5 \u2014 for bullying, harassment, being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and having a \u201cbad attitude.\u201d\n\nThe system didn\u2019t explain why it had made that decision. But Battaglia, who had believed the sitter was trustworthy, suddenly felt pangs of doubt.\n\n\u201cSocial media shows a person\u2019s character,\u201d said Battaglia, 29, who lives outside Los Angeles. \u201cSo why did she come in at a 2 and not a 1?\u201d\n\nPredictim is offering parents the same playbook that dozens of other tech firms are selling to employers around the world: artificial-intelligence systems that analyze a person\u2019s speech, facial expressions and online history with promises of revealing the hidden aspects of their private lives.\n\nThe technology is reshaping how some companies approach recruiting, hiring and reviewing workers, offering employers an unrivaled look at job candidates through a new wave of invasive psychological assessment and surveillance.\n\nThe tech firm Fama says it uses AI to police workers' social media for \u201ctoxic behavior\u201d and alert their bosses. And the recruitment-technology firm HireVue, which works with companies such as Geico, Hilton and Unilever, offers a system that automatically analyzes applicants' tone, word choice and facial movements during video interviews to predict their skill and demeanor on the job. (Candidates are encouraged to smile for best results.)\n\nBut critics say Predictim and similar systems present their own dangers by making automated and possibly life-altering decisions virtually unchecked.\n\nThe systems depend on black-box algorithms that give little detail about how they reduced the complexities of a person\u2019s inner life into a calculation of virtue or harm. And even as Predictim\u2019s technology influences parents\u2019 thinking, it remains entirely unproven, largely unexplained and vulnerable to quiet biases over how an appropriate babysitter should share, look and speak.\n\nThere\u2019s this \u201cmad rush to seize the power of AI to make all kinds of decisions without ensuring it\u2019s accountable to human beings,\u201d said Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a tech advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s like people have drunk the digital Kool-Aid and think this is an appropriate way to govern our lives.\u201d\n\n[Unproven facial-recognition companies target schools, promising an end to shootings]\n\nPredictim\u2019s scans analyze the entire history of a babysitter\u2019s social media, which, for many of the youngest sitters, can cover most of their lives. And the sitters are told they will be at a great disadvantage for the competitive jobs if they refuse.\n\nPredictim\u2019s chief and co-founder Sal Parsa said the company, launched last month as part of the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s SkyDeck tech incubator, takes ethical questions about its use of the technology seriously. Parents, he said, should see the ratings as a companion that \u201cmay or may not reflect the sitter\u2019s actual attributes.\u201d\n\nBut the danger of hiring a problematic or violent babysitter, he added, makes the AI a necessary tool for any parent hoping to keep his or her child safe.\n\n\u201cIf you search for abusive babysitters on Google, you\u2019ll see hundreds of results right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s people out there who either have mental illness or are just born evil. Our goal is to do anything we can to stop them.\u201d\n\nA Predictim scan starts at $24.99 and requires a babysitter\u2019s name and email address and her consent to share broad access to her social media accounts. The babysitter can decline, but a parent is notified of her refusal, and in an email the babysitter is told \u201cthe interested parent will not be able to hire you until you complete this request.\u201d\n\nPredictim\u2019s executives say they use language-processing algorithms and an image-recognition software known as \u201ccomputer vision\u201d to assess babysitters\u2019 Facebook, Twitter and Instagram posts for clues about their offline life. The parent is provided the report exclusively and does not have to tell the sitter the results.\n\nParents could, presumably, look at their sitters\u2019 public social media accounts themselves. But the computer-generated reports promise an in-depth inspection of years of online activity, boiled down to a single digit: an intoxicatingly simple solution to an impractical task.\n\n[When your kid tries to say \u2018Alexa\u2019 before \u2018Mama\u2019]\n\nThe risk ratings are divided into several categories, including explicit content and drug abuse. The start-up has also advertised that its system can evaluate babysitters on other personality traits, such as politeness, ability to work with others and \u201cpositivity.\u201d\n\nThe company hopes to upend the multibillion-dollar \u201cparental outsourcing\u201d industry and has begun advertising through paid sponsorships of parenting and \u201cmommy\u201d blogs. The company\u2019s marketing focuses heavily on its ability to expose hidden secrets and prevent \u201cevery parent\u2019s nightmare,\u201d citing criminal cases including that of a Kentucky babysitter charged earlier this year with severely injuring an 8-month-old girl.\n\n\u201cHad the parents of the little girl injured by this babysitter been able to use Predictim as part of their vetting process,\u201d a company marketing document says, \u201cthey would never have left her alone with their precious child.\u201d\n\nBut tech experts say the system raises red flags of its own, including worries that it is preying on parents\u2019 fears to sell personality scans of untested accuracy.\n\nThey also question how the systems are being trained and how vulnerable they might be to misunderstanding the blurred meanings of sitters\u2019 social media use. For all but the highest-risk scans, the parents are given only a suggestion of questionable behavior and no specific phrases, links or details to assess on their own.\n\nWhen one babysitter\u2019s scan was flagged for possible bullying behavior, the unnerved mother who requested it said she couldn\u2019t tell whether the software had spotted an old movie quote, song lyric or other phrase as opposed to actual bullying language.\n\n\n\nJessie Battaglia's phone displays results from the Predictim app. (Kyle Grillot for The Washington Post)\n\nJamie L. Williams, a staff attorney at the civil-liberties group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said most algorithms deployed now to assess the meaning of words and images online are widely known to lack a human reader\u2019s context and common sense. Even tech giants such as Facebook have struggled to build algorithms that can tell the difference between a harmless comment and hate speech.\n\n\u201cRunning this system on teenagers: I mean, they\u2019re kids!\u201d Williams said. \u201cKids have inside jokes. They\u2019re notoriously sarcastic. Something that could sound like a \u2018bad attitude\u2019 to the algorithm could sound to someone else like a political statement or valid criticism.\u201d\n\nAnd when the system gets it wrong \u2014 suggesting, for instance, that a babysitter abuses drugs \u2014 it can be impossible for a parent to know. The system\u2019s clear-cut ratings and assertions of confidence might lead parents to expect it to be far more accurate or authoritative than a human could be, steering parents toward sitters they otherwise would have avoided or away from people who had already earned their trust.\n\n\u201cThere are no metrics yet to really make it clear whether these tools are effective in predicting what they say they are,\u201d said Miranda Bogen, a senior policy analyst at Upturn, a Washington think tank that researches how algorithms are used in automated decision-making and criminal justice. \u201cThe pull of these technologies is very likely outpacing their actual capacity.\u201d\n\nMalissa Nielsen, Battaglia\u2019s 24-year-old babysitter, gave her approval recently to two separate families who asked her to hand over social media access to Predictim. She said she has always been careful on social media and figured sharing more about herself couldn\u2019t hurt: She goes to church once a week, doesn\u2019t curse and is finishing a degree in early-childhood education, with which she hopes to open a preschool.\n\nBut after she learned that the system had given her imperfect grades for bullying and disrespect, she was stunned. She had believed she was allowing the parents to review her social media, not consenting to having an algorithm dissect her personality. She also hadn\u2019t been told of the results for a test that could cripple her only source of income.\n\n\u201cI would have wanted to investigate a little. Why would it think that about me?\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cA computer doesn\u2019t have feelings. It can\u2019t determine all that stuff.\u201d\n\n[What artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t understand]\n\nAmericans still harbor a lingering distrust over algorithms whose decisions could affect their daily life. In a Pew Research Center survey released this month, 57 percent of respondents said they thought automated r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screening of job applicants was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nBut Predictim nevertheless says it is gearing up for a nationwide expansion. Executives at Sittercity, an online babysitter marketplace visited by millions of parents, said they are launching a pilot program early next year that will fold in Predictim\u2019s automated ratings into the site\u2019s current array of sitter screenings and background checks.\n\n\u201cFinding a sitter can come with a lot of uncertainty,\u201d said Sandra Dainora, Sittercity\u2019s head of product, who believes tools like these could soon become \u201cstandard currency\u201d for finding caregivers online. \u201cParents are always seeking the best solution, the most research, the best facts.\u201d\n\nPredictim\u2019s leaders also believe they can greatly expand the system\u2019s capabilities to offer even more intimate measurements of a babysitter\u2019s private life. Joel Simonoff, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, said the team is interested in gaining \u201cuseful psychometric data\u201d from babysitters\u2019 social media by running their histories through personality tests, such as Myers Briggs, and offering to sell parents the results.\n\nPredictim\u2019s social media mining and interest in mass psychological analysis mirror the ambitions of Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy that worked for the Trump campaign and wrenched Facebook into a global privacy scandal. But Predictim\u2019s leaders say they have set up internal safeguards and work to protect babysitters\u2019 personal data. \u201cIf we ever leaked a babysitter\u2019s info, that would not be cool,\u201d Simonoff said.\n\n\n\nJessie Battaglia holds her son, Bennett, in their home. (Kyle Grillot for The Washington Post)\n\nExperts worry AI rating systems such as Predictim\u2019s portend a future where every job, not just in child care, is decided by a machine. A number of firms in hiring and recruiting are already building or investing in systems that can analyze candidates' r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on a massive scale and provide an automated assessment of how each might perform. Similar AI systems \u2014 including from Jigsaw, a tech incubator created by Google \u2014 are used to patrol online comments across the Web for harassment, threats and abuse.\n\nBut hiring and recruiting algorithms have routinely been shown to hide the kinds of subtle biases that could derail a person\u2019s career. Amazon.com stopped developing a recruiting algorithm after learning that it had been unfairly penalizing female candidates, sources told Reuters \u2014 because the company\u2019s history of hires in the male-dominated tech industry had taught the system that male attributes were preferred. The company has said the tool was never used to evaluate candidates. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nSome AI experts believe that systems like these have the potential to supercharge the biases of age or racial profiling, including flagging words or images from certain groups more often than others. They also worry that Predictim could coerce young babysitters into handing over intimate data just to get a job.\n\nBut Diana Werner, a mother of two living just north of San Francisco, said she believes babysitters should be willing to share their personal information to help with parents\u2019 peace of mind.\n\n\u201cA background check is nice, but Predictim goes into depth, really dissecting a person \u2014 their social and mental status,\u201d she said.\n\nWhere she lives, \u201c100 percent of the parents are going to want to use this,\u201d she added. \u201cWe all want the perfect babysitter.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Christopher Federico", "title": "The Beatles, \u2018Rain\u2019: The Week In One Song", "description": "The president takes a rain check on honoring the WWI dead.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/11/16/the-beatles-rain-the-week-in-one-song/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gGl1Twan8lpSxX63EYqLSHA6tqo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AWIH2DYOMU4H3CWM4OGFSBAKPI.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:00:38Z", "content": "Perspective Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events", "fulltext": "Opinion The only cause our president is willing to serve is his own well-being"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Jury indicts Puerto Rico man accused of threatening CNN", "description": "A federal grand jury in Puerto Rico has indicted a man accused of posting threatening messages on Twitter about wanting to bomb CNN", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/jury-indicts-puerto-rico-man-accused-of-threatening-cnn/2018/11/16/c53ff388-e9c8-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:55:16Z", "content": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico A federal grand jury in Puerto Rico has indicted a man accused of posting threatening messages on Twitter about wanting to bomb CNN.

A centuries-old political compromise has ensured America\u2019s elite cities and the densely populated states around them are getting increasingly less say in how the nation is governed.\n\nTheir economic success is leading to diluted political power in the Senate, where two seats are given to each state regardless of population, and in the electoral college, where votes are based on a state\u2019s representation in the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nOthers have explained the economics of why companies such as Google, Apple and Amazon, whose founder and CEO, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post, prefer to expand into cities which are already economic superstars. But how does that square with the electoral impact of concentrating American professionals in just a few urban areas?\n\nUnlike the U.S. economy, the U.S. political system penalizes growth. The effect is easiest to see at the state level, where senators are selected. Commerce Department figures show that the five largest states have less representation \u2014 relative to the national average \u2014 than at any other time on record. Comparable figures begin in 1968.\n\nAs Silicon Valley corporations rose to dominate the national conversation, senators in California gained well over 600,000 constituents in a typical two-year span. That\u2019s more than senators in Vermont or Wyoming represent, total.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, the most populous states also accounted for the highest share of the nation\u2019s income on record. And their collective income, which we\u2019re using as a proxy for household economic output, has grown faster than income in any other decile of states since the Great Recession.\n\nThere is a similar but smaller effect in the House. Seats there are reallocated once a decade, and tend to lag population growth. The electoral college reflects both chambers.\n\nClara Hendrickson, who studies governance at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution and helped author a new report on regional economic inequality, described a \u201ctroubling imbalance between the places that enjoy economic power and the places that enjoy political power.\u201d\n\n\u201cComing out of the 2016 election, the debate has focused on whether forces of economic anxiety or cultural anxiety have contributed more to Trump support,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think regional inequality is an important part of that debate. It reflects both economic and cultural divides.\u201d\n\nBut, she said, \u201cIf we go too far to pursuing a political solution which tries to give more power to the regions that are winning in today\u2019s economy, we\u2019re discounting our obligations to people who today live in economically underperforming regions.\u201d\n\nIn a recent paper in the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society, Jason Spicer, now of the University of Toronto, observes that the flow of people from rust-belt states interacted with the state-level winner-take-all electoral system to give older, whiter voters outsize influence in the 2016 election. This type of government allows regional inequality to build up to higher levels than in countries with proportional representation, Spicer said.\n\n\u201cIt is no accident that the first and most powerful shocks of the backlash to neoliberal globalization came in the U.S. (Trump) and the U.K. (Brexit),\u201d two countries with winner-take-all elections, Spicer said via email.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t gloss over that the emerging knowledge economy is inherently an urban one,\u201d said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings. \u201cThat accentuates the stresses of the founding fathers\u2019 system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been here before,\u201d Muro said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a digitally oriented, agglomeration-driven economy.\u201d The political side effects, he said, \u201care becoming an impediment to efficient economic growth.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the most recent year covered by the Commerce Department, the five biggest metro areas by population were in the five largest states: California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois. Voters in the sixth-largest metro, D.C., are under-represented in national politics.\n\nThe country\u2019s most economically important cities aren\u2019t even guaranteed to determine their state\u2019s national representatives. Sen Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) won the state\u2019s contested Senate seat by a 2.6-percentage-point margin earlier this month, despite heavy support for Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke in Dallas and Houston, two of the largest cities in the country.\n\nThe stellar election maps from the Post\u2019s graphics and engineering teams show a similar pattern in another large state, Florida, though the outcome of the Senate contest between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Bill Nelson remains unclear.\n\nTo be sure, there are ways to convert economic strength into political influence. \u201cMost campaign contributions come from the major urban areas,\u201d according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

(Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)\n\nEconomically, America\u2019s most prosperous regions are more dominant than ever. Politically, they\u2019re not.\n\nAmazon divided its second headquarters evenly among what are likely the two most powerful urban areas in the U.S. It seems like yet more evidence that the economy\u2019s rush to agglomeration will reduce the nation to a hollow core of \u201cAmerican carnage,\" as famously described by President Trump in his inaugural address, flanked by space-age big cities on the two coasts.\n\nBut that vision collides head-on with an alternative view. A centuries-old political compromise has ensured America\u2019s elite cities and the densely populated states around them are getting increasingly less say in how the nation is governed.\n\nTheir economic success is leading to diluted political power in the Senate, where two seats are given to each state regardless of population, and in the electoral college, where votes are based on a state\u2019s representation in the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nOthers have explained the economics of why companies such as Google, Apple and Amazon, whose founder and CEO, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post, prefer to expand into cities which are already economic superstars. But how does that square with the electoral impact of concentrating American professionals in just a few urban areas?\n\nUnlike the U.S. economy, the U.S. political system penalizes growth. The effect is easiest to see at the state level, where senators are selected. Commerce Department figures show that the five largest states have less representation \u2014 relative to the national average \u2014 than at any other time on record. Comparable figures begin in 1968.\n\nAs Silicon Valley corporations rose to dominate the national conversation, senators in California gained well over 600,000 constituents in a typical two-year span. That\u2019s more than senators in Vermont or Wyoming represent, total.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, the most populous states also accounted for the highest share of the nation\u2019s income on record. And their collective income, which we\u2019re using as a proxy for household economic output, has grown faster than income in any other decile of states since the Great Recession.\n\nThere is a similar but smaller effect in the House. Seats there are reallocated once a decade, and tend to lag population growth. The electoral college reflects both chambers.\n\nClara Hendrickson, who studies governance at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution and helped author a new report on regional economic inequality, described a \u201ctroubling imbalance between the places that enjoy economic power and the places that enjoy political power.\u201d\n\n\u201cComing out of the 2016 election, the debate has focused on whether forces of economic anxiety or cultural anxiety have contributed more to Trump support,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think regional inequality is an important part of that debate. It reflects both economic and cultural divides.\u201d\n\nBut, she said, \u201cIf we go too far to pursuing a political solution which tries to give more power to the regions that are winning in today\u2019s economy, we\u2019re discounting our obligations to people who today live in economically underperforming regions.\u201d\n\nIn a recent paper in the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society, Jason Spicer, now of the University of Toronto, observes that the flow of people from rust-belt states interacted with the state-level winner-take-all electoral system to give older, whiter voters outsize influence in the 2016 election. This type of government allows regional inequality to build up to higher levels than in countries with proportional representation, Spicer said.\n\n\u201cIt is no accident that the first and most powerful shocks of the backlash to neoliberal globalization came in the U.S. (Trump) and the U.K. (Brexit),\u201d two countries with winner-take-all elections, Spicer said via email.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t gloss over that the emerging knowledge economy is inherently an urban one,\u201d said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings. \u201cThat accentuates the stresses of the founding fathers\u2019 system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been here before,\u201d Muro said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a digitally oriented, agglomeration-driven economy.\u201d The political side effects, he said, \u201care becoming an impediment to efficient economic growth.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the most recent year covered by the Commerce Department, the five biggest metro areas by population were in the five largest states: California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois. Voters in the sixth-largest metro, D.C., are under-represented in national politics.\n\nThe country\u2019s most economically important cities aren\u2019t even guaranteed to determine their state\u2019s national representatives. Sen Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) won the state\u2019s contested Senate seat by a 2.6-percentage-point margin earlier this month, despite heavy support for Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke in Dallas and Houston, two of the largest cities in the country.\n\nThe stellar election maps from the Post\u2019s graphics and engineering teams show a similar pattern in another large state, Florida, though the outcome of the Senate contest between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Bill Nelson remains unclear.\n\nTo be sure, there are ways to convert economic strength into political influence. \u201cMost campaign contributions come from the major urban areas,\u201d according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Residents of large cities flex their muscles through political spending, lobbying and positions in the Federal bureaucracy.\n\nThere are plenty of exceptions on both sides. Some small states thrive while some large ones flail. We\u2019ve simplified things here to illustrate the paradox at the heart of the country\u2019s economic bifurcation.\n\nThe real tension is between regional inequality and a functioning democratic system, Hendrickson said. \u201cEnsuring the health of American democracy might depend on achieving a certain level of geographic cohesion.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Keith Humphreys", "title": "Marijuana is getting cheaper.

Although this implies that some marijuana entrepreneurs are going to go bankrupt, the bigger financial hit will be felt by states that tax marijuana based on its price.\n\nMarijuana prices are collapsing in Colorado and in other legalization states (e.g., Oregon, where the price can go as low as $100/pound) because a legal business is dramatically cheaper to operate than an illegal one. Because states generally set their marijuana tax rates as a percentage of price, their revenue per sale sinks in direct proportion to the fall in marijuana prices. Ironically, in a bid for more tax revenue per marijuana sale, Colorado increased its marijuana tax rate from 10 percent to 15 percent last year, only to see the anticipated added tax revenue wiped out by falling prices in a year\u2019s time.\n\n[Democratic House flip may mean full legalization of marijuana in nation\u2019s capital]\n\nStates may have failed to anticipate this problem because of misleading predictions about the effects of legalization. Pro-legalization economist Jeffrey Miron projected in 2010 that marijuana prices would only fall 50 percent when prohibition was repealed, leaving the drug at a price that would yield high tax revenue. That was clearly a rosy scenario.\n\nA starker prediction made by drug policy analyst Jonathan Caulkins looks more prescient every day: He forecast that legalized marijuana will eventually fall in price to the level of other easily grown, legal plants such as wheat and barley, such that a joint might sell for a nickel or even become a complimentary item akin to beer nuts at the bar. If that comes to pass, taxes based on a percentage of price might not even cover the costs of the government\u2019s regulatory system for legal marijuana, meaning that rather than helping states\u2019 bottom line the industry would be an outright drain on the public purse.\n\nThe simplest way for states to retain some revenue from marijuana sales is to tax the drug by weight, as California has always done and Maine has started to do. The main risk of this approach is that producers will sharply increase product potency to create more \u201cbang per ounce.\u201d However, this shortcoming of weight-based taxes can be surmounted by capping the allowed potency of marijuana products, a policy for which there is already a good case to be made on public health grounds."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Erik Wemple", "title": "Trump-appointed judge: Get CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta back in the White House", "description": "Orders that hard pass to White House be reinstated, based on denial of due process.

It emerged after the White House yanked the press credentials of Jim Acosta following that contentious Nov. 7 post-midterms press conference at the White House. The most powerful people in the world expressed contempt for Acosta\u2019s behavior on that occasion and justified the access block on that front.\n\nPlus! In a statement justifying the action, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders wrote, in part, \u201cCNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nIn the intervening days, that very sentiment \u2014 that a news organization\u2019s chief White House correspondent was, in effect, a meaningless position \u2014 has been plastered all over social media, not to mention a court filing from government lawyers opposing CNN\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) restoring Acosta\u2019s hard pass. \u201cMr. Acosta remains able to practice his profession and report on the White House. And CNN\u2019s straits are even less dire, given that the network has roughly 50 other employees who retain hard passes and who are more than capable of covering the White House complex on CNN\u2019s behalf,\u201d argued Justice Department lawyers in the case.\n\nWell, so much for all that.\n\nIn a Friday morning court session, Judge Timothy Kelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia lent his thinking to the matter, which resulted in the granting of CNN\u2019s request for the TRO \u2014 meaning that Acosta\u2019s press pass will be reinstated, though just \u201ctemporarily,\u201d according to a statement from Sanders. In his discussion of the TRO request, Kelly considered the likelihood that CNN would prevail in its arguments that the hard-pass revocation violated due-process considerations. Likely, Kelly ruled. Wednesday\u2019s oral arguments and the judge\u2019s explanation centered on the 1977 case Sherrill v. Knight, in which a \u201ccourt found that denial of White House credentials was a sufficiently grave infringement on the freedom of the press that it couldn\u2019t just be done by fiat.\u201d In his own summation, Kelly said that Sherrill stands for the proposition that the \u201cFifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause protects a reporter\u2019s First Amendment liberty interest in a White House press pass.\u201d\n\nSeeing comments that CNN ruling had nothing to do with 1st Amend - all about 5th. Not quite right. Sherrill v Knight's holding was that procedural requirements of notice, opp to respond, etc, were compelled by the finding that interests in credentials were protected by 1st Amend. \u2014 Jonathan Peters (@jonathanwpeters) November 16, 2018\n\nAs Kelly plowed through the particulars, he also considered whether the revocation constituted \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d In this context, he addressed the idea that other reporters could well do what Acosta does:\n\nHere, the procedures and process violation at issue, that has led to the deprivation of what [Sherrill v. Knight] requires me to recognize as a liberty interest \u2026 that\u2019s grounded in the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press. Moreover, the First Amendment interests as recognized in Sherrill were not vested merely in publications or agencies; they were liberties of the individual journalists themselves. For that reason, that CNN may still send another journalist or other journalists to the White House does not make the harm to Mr. Acosta any less irreparable. \u2026 It\u2019s a harm that cannot be remedied in retrospect. \u2026 So on this highly, highly unusual set of facts and interests at stake, I do find that the plaintiffs have met their burden of establishing that irreparable harm has and will continue to occur in the absence of [remedy].\n\nBolding included to highlight an understatement that drives at the whole point here: What\u2019s highly unusual is that the White House revoked the access of a journalist over charges of \u2026 what, exactly? Kelly\u2019s recognition of the individual right to pursue journalism is a helpful step, even if the age of the Internet \u2014 when people without flashy access badges commit acts of journalism all the time \u2014 reminds us daily of this point.\n\nAlso refreshing was this rebuke of the manner in which the White House proceeded in revoking the press pass of a White House correspondent:\n\nHere's what Trump-appointed Judge Kelly said about gov't case: \"Whatever process occurred within the government is still so shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me at oral argument who made the initial decision to revoke Mr. Acosta's press pass.\" \u2014 ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) November 16, 2018\n\nAs he finished his presentation, Kelly emphasized what he hadn\u2019t decided \u2014 namely, whether there was a content-based First Amendment issue at hand: \u201cI have not determined that the First Amendment was violated here. I have not determined what legal standard would apply to the First Amendment claim here.\u201d A statement from Sanders seized on this omission: \u201cToday, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House. In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass. We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House.\u201d\n\nEven so, Acosta will be haunting the White House grounds very shortly.

Stone claimed contact with WikiLeaks again in an Aug. 18, 2016, conference call.\n\nStone now says all of this was puffery \u2014 false claims to make himself seem more important \u2014 and that he got information through an intermediary journalist, Randy Credico. (Credico has denied this, and the evidence is mixed.)\n\nBut even if Stone\u2019s denial is accurate, he also praised WikiLeaks \u2014 even calling Assange his \u201chero.\u201d \u201cI have total confidence that @wikileaks and my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon,\u201d he tweeted on Oct. 3, 2016, a few days before the Podesta email dump. \"#LockHerUp.\u201d\n\nAnd in addition to praising and defending WikiLeaks and Assange, there is also documentation of direct contact \u2014 via Twitter, at least. WikiLeaks on Oct. 13, 2016, again denied contact with Stone, prompting him to send direct messages to its Twitter account asking it to lay off him since he was defending it. After Trump won, WikiLeaks messaged Stone saying, \u201cHappy? We are now more free to communicate.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr.\n\nThe president\u2019s son also exchanged direct messages on Twitter with WikiLeaks, and may have even taken direction from it on a small scale.\n\nWikiLeaks direct-messaged Trump Jr. on Sept. 20, 2016, giving him a password it discovered for a new anti-Trump PAC\u2019s website, PutinTrump.org. Trump Jr. responded the next day: \u201cOff the record I don\u2019t know who that is but I\u2019ll ask around. Thanks.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2016, WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. for help in pushing a story involving Clinton allegedly saying Assange should be droned. Trump Jr. said the campaign \u201calready did that earlier today\u201d and then asked about a \u201cWednesday leak I keep reading about.\u201d There was no response.\n\nThe most significant known bit of possible coordination came Oct. 12, 2016 \u2014 after the Podesta dump \u2014 when WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to promote its leaked Democratic documents so Trump supporters could dig through them. Two days later, Trump Jr. tweeted exactly the link WikiLeaks had put in the direct message \u2014 including not using the \u201chttp://\u201d.\n\nFor those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy all the @wikileaks emails are right here: https://t.co/SGcEeM9rCS \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 14, 2016\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump Jr. would have done it anyway \u2014 the Trump campaign had been talking about the leaked documents for days \u2014 but Trump Jr.'s text was basically exactly what WikiLeaks had requested.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nThere is no documented indication of coordination between the president himself and WikiLeaks.

Stone has denied working with WikiLeaks, despite repeatedly claiming in real time to have interacted with it, privately messaging with the organization\u2019s Twitter account, and even appearing to preview its dump of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails.\n\nStone claimed in an Aug. 3, 2016, email to confidant Sam Nunberg that he had dinner with Assange \u2014 something he now says was a joke.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Roger Stone's email to Sam Nunberg saying he dined with @JulianAssange pic.twitter.com/bBYY9CPcWe \u2014 Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) April 4, 2018\n\nThe next day, he claimed Assange was \u201cgoing to continue to drop information on the American voters that is going to roil this race.\u201d Four days later, he again said he had been in contact with WikiLeaks \u2014 something WikiLeaks denied the next day. Stone claimed contact with WikiLeaks again in an Aug. 18, 2016, conference call.\n\nStone now says all of this was puffery \u2014 false claims to make himself seem more important \u2014 and that he got information through an intermediary journalist, Randy Credico. (Credico has denied this, and the evidence is mixed.)\n\nBut even if Stone\u2019s denial is accurate, he also praised WikiLeaks \u2014 even calling Assange his \u201chero.\u201d \u201cI have total confidence that @wikileaks and my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon,\u201d he tweeted on Oct. 3, 2016, a few days before the Podesta email dump. \"#LockHerUp.\u201d\n\nAnd in addition to praising and defending WikiLeaks and Assange, there is also documentation of direct contact \u2014 via Twitter, at least. WikiLeaks on Oct. 13, 2016, again denied contact with Stone, prompting him to send direct messages to its Twitter account asking it to lay off him since he was defending it. After Trump won, WikiLeaks messaged Stone saying, \u201cHappy? We are now more free to communicate.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr.\n\nThe president\u2019s son also exchanged direct messages on Twitter with WikiLeaks, and may have even taken direction from it on a small scale.\n\nWikiLeaks direct-messaged Trump Jr. on Sept. 20, 2016, giving him a password it discovered for a new anti-Trump PAC\u2019s website, PutinTrump.org. Trump Jr. responded the next day: \u201cOff the record I don\u2019t know who that is but I\u2019ll ask around. Thanks.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2016, WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. for help in pushing a story involving Clinton allegedly saying Assange should be droned. Trump Jr. said the campaign \u201calready did that earlier today\u201d and then asked about a \u201cWednesday leak I keep reading about.\u201d There was no response.\n\nThe most significant known bit of possible coordination came Oct. 12, 2016 \u2014 after the Podesta dump \u2014 when WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to promote its leaked Democratic documents so Trump supporters could dig through them. Two days later, Trump Jr. tweeted exactly the link WikiLeaks had put in the direct message \u2014 including not using the \u201chttp://\u201d.\n\nFor those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy all the @wikileaks emails are right here: https://t.co/SGcEeM9rCS \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 14, 2016\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump Jr. would have done it anyway \u2014 the Trump campaign had been talking about the leaked documents for days \u2014 but Trump Jr.'s text was basically exactly what WikiLeaks had requested.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nThere is no documented indication of coordination between the president himself and WikiLeaks. But the president did spend a healthy amount of time promoting WikiLeaks.\n\n\u201cWikiLeaks \u2014 I love WikiLeaks,\u201d he said Oct. 10, 2016, in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThis WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable,\u201d he said Oct. 12, 2016, in Florida. \u201cIt tells you the inner heart; you gotta read it.\u201d\n\nTrump declared his love for WikiLeaks many times on the campaign trail...and the admiration was apparently mutual. https://t.co/UMjghHQKaW #inners pic.twitter.com/sYvBDs6Rcn \u2014 All In w/Chris Hayes (@allinwithchris) November 14, 2017\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing what\u2019s coming out on WikiLeaks,\u201d Trump said Oct. 13, 2016, in Ohio.\n\n\u201cGetting off the plane, they were just announcing new WikiLeaks, and I wanted to stay there, but I didn\u2019t want to keep you waiting,\u201d he said Nov. 4, 2016, just before Election Day. \u201cBoy, I love reading those WikiLeaks.\u201d\n\nAfter his election and as evidence that Russia was behind the WikiLeaks disclosures, Trump decided to defend Assange and cast doubt on Russia\u2019s role.\n\n\u201cJulian Assange said \u2018a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta\u2019 \u2014 why was DNC so careless?\u201d Trump tweeted Jan. 4, 2017. \u201cAlso said Russians did not give him the info!\u201d\n\nJulian Assange said \"a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta\" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017\n\nAfter that raised a stir, Trump clarified: \u201cThe dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange \u2014 wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people . . . to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against \u2018Intelligence\u2019 when in fact I am a big fan!\u201d\n\nThe dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017\n\nto make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against \"Intelligence\" when in fact I am a big fan! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017\n\nThe reason that tweet caused a stir is that questions about the legality of Assange\u2019s work \u2014 and who his allies are \u2014 have lingered for years. He has long disclosed things that harmed the U.S. government, and he\u2019s drawn bipartisan condemnation for it.\n\nEven as he was selling something clearly helpful to Trump, basically any politician would know you tread lightly with Assange and WikiLeaks. You never know what might come next to make embracing them look foolish.\n\nAnd the charges against Assange could make all of the above look rather foolish. It also could merely be the beginning."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Ian Livingston", "title": "Washington notched its record 21st heavy rain storm of 2018 Thursday as Baltimore clinched its wettest year in history", "description": "If you feel like it's been raining a lot, you're quite right.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2018/11/16/washington-notched-its-record-st-heavy-rain-storm-thursday-baltimore-clinched-its-wettest-year-history/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aWhnAItreZZiLSVjsqD08KJBU44=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OA366SLK55APDGUDHGRPIE2IQE.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:17:19Z", "content": "The same storm that brought the D.C. region an unusually early accumulating snowfall on Thursday also brought the equivalent of more than an inch of rain to the area.

The 21 days of one inch or more precipitation tied 1878 for the most such days on record. Considering the next most cases of so many heavy rain events was 19 in 1932, very few people have seen a year so wet.\n\nThursday\u2019s precipitation output in Washington was also enough to push its 2018 rainfall amount to the fourth wettest in recorded history. Through Thursday, 58.33 inches have fallen this year. With six weeks left in 2018, only three years stand in the way of this becoming Washington\u2019s all-time wettest year: 1878 (60.09 inches), 2003 (60.83 inches) and 1889 (61.33) inches.\n\nLooking ahead, Washington averages more than 4.5 inches of additional precipitation (rain plus melted snow).

And the rains have kept coming.\n\n\n\n(Ian Livingston/The Washington Post)\n\nWith 33.35 inches falling in Washington from mid-July to mid-November, the rain during this period is unlike anything in Washington\u2019s recorded past.

How deeply did his corruption network manage to infiltrate the Mexican government and law enforcement on both sides of the border? What allegations currently floating around Mexico as secretos a voces (rumors) are actually true? How much chaos and drama can his defense create to deflect from the charges?\n\nThe trial kicked off Tuesday with statements from Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers: Guzm\u00e1n was not the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, argued Jeffrey Lichtman; Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada was and remains the man who ran the world\u2019s biggest drug trafficking organization, corrupting the presidencies of Felipe Calder\u00f3n (2006-2012) and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is stepping down in December. Judge Brian Corgan warned the defense against making statements lacking necessary evidence. Both presidents denied the accusations.\n\nSuch claims were to be expected from those defending a man who faces charges of drug trafficking, money laundering, torture and homicide. But maybe it\u2019s not what Guzm\u00e1n knows about politicians that matters most for the post-trial drug war, even if such revelations might satisfy some public blood lust. What he knows about the money laundering and the banks may be more important.\n\nProsecutors are seeking $14 billion in restitution payments from Guzm\u00e1n. His wealth is actually incalculable \u2014 experts have scoffed at the idea that he is worth that much \u2014 but going after his money is still the smartest long-term strategy. It might even appeal to the incoming leftist president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, even if it would alienate some of the global powers.\n\nThere\u2019s an old joke among some residents in the seaside resort city of Acapulco: If the government were to really go after money laundering in the drug trade, Acapulco would collapse into the ocean. It\u2019s possible that the global economy would do the same. It\u2019s now widely accepted that the Sinaloa Cartel helped prop up the global financial system between 2006 and 2009, channeling nearly $1 billion into major banks in spite of the fact that Sinaloa, a northwestern Mexican state, was on a list of flagged areas for large cash deposits. Investigators found that as much as $350 billion in global drug profits was allowed to slip into the financial system in the late 2000s. One bank, HSBC, was slapped with a $1.9 billion fine for its failing to stop the inflow of money from Sinaloa in particular, and made a probation deal with the Justice Department to tighten anti-money-laundering controls over the next five years in order to avoid prosecution.\n\nIf Guzm\u00e1n tells the court how he managed to move his money \u2014 reportedly invested in properties from Mexico to Colombia to Eastern Europe, and pour it into the legitimate economy \u2014 U.S. and Mexican authorities could use that knowledge, and the sources who once worked the other side, to attempt to choke the cartels. According to former agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration who worked in Mexico during their careers, asset forfeiture is rarely implemented in Mexico; the military or federal police regularly seize assets from drug lords \u2014 sports cars, weapons, cash \u2014 and display it for the media to see, but according to DEA vets, the assets are most often returned to their original owners a few months later.\n\nWhen he takes office in December, L\u00f3pez Obrador should work to beef up the asset forfeiture process and share financial information with the Treasury Department and U.S. investigators. Any assets seized could be used to fulfill the new president\u2019s promises to create social programs for Mexico\u2019s poor, and some of the money could even be used to promote international business ties, thus placating the global business community that has long been wary of Latin American leftists.\n\nRead more:\n\nDanielle Allen: How the war on drugs creates violence\n\nRobert Gebelhoff: The opioid crisis isn\u2019t just about negligence.

Walker ruled on a request for a preliminary injunction seeking to force Florida\u2019s Republican candidate for Senate, Gov. Rick Scott, to recuse himself from acting in his capacity as governor in supervising the election recount. On its face, the ruling denying the motion might seem like a win for Scott. However, if one actually reads the opinion, it\u2019s a stunning rebuke of Scott \u2014 and, by implication, President Trump.\n\nThe court noted a series of statements by Scott that might be seen as leaning on election officials to come to the \u201cright\u201d result:\n\nScott \u201curg[ed]\u201d local law enforcement to be on the lookout for potential fraud. As votes were still being counted, Scott asked\u2014but did not order\u2014state law enforcement to investigate two counties, citing no evidence for the investigation. Although the Department of State already had monitors in Broward County, and they had made nary a whisper about any criminal activity, Scott merely requested law enforcement investigate possible untoward conduct. If Scott ordered [law enforcement] to investigate, then a stronger case could be made for unconstitutional intimidation\u2014a witch hunt, to use the parlance of the era. \u2026 Even so, Scott\u2019s request to state law enforcement must be viewed in the context of Scott\u2019s other contemporaneous public statements. \u201cI will not sit idly by,\u201d Scott said outside the Governor\u2019s mansion, \u201cwhile unethical liberals try to steal this election.\u201d Later on television, after noting his order to state law enforcement, Scott declared \u201cwe\u2019re gonna fight this and we\u2019re gonna win.\u201d He also explained \u201cwe\u2019re gonna do everything we can,\u201d \u201cwe\u2019re gonna fight this and we\u2019re gonna win this.\u201d These are Scott\u2019s most troubling utterances. [Citations omitted.]\n\nThe court\u2019s language assessing Scott\u2019s conduct was scathing: \u201cWhen a public official acting in his official capacity crosses that line, he ventures into a thicket of actual or potential bias. Then, constitutional alarm bells ring.\u201d Walker warned, \u201cWhat Scott cannot do is undercut the count and mandatory recount of votes from his perch of public official. Grave problems arise when an individual involved in the electoral process uses his official powers to influence the outcome. Unconstitutionality can follow. Binding precedent could not be clearer.\u201d\n\nThe judge, however, noted that Scott asked but did not order vote counting to be stopped. (\u201cThough sometimes careening perilously close to a due process violation, Scott\u2019s most questionable conduct has occurred in his capacity as a candidate rather than as governor.\u201d) Scott \u201chas not suspended any election official. He has not ordered any investigation. He has not interfered with the recount so far. He has even recused himself from the Elections Canvassing Commission.\u201d In other words, Scott has come right up to the line but has not stepped over it, at least not quite yet.\n\nThe court held:\n\n\u201cNo man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.\u201d The Federalist No. 10 (James Madison). Scott should be on notice. Florida is entering its first-ever manual recount in which Scott is an interested party with ample power to meddle in the process. Scott\u2019s past statements occurred primarily when he wore his candidate hat. The Due Process Clause requires Scott to remain impartial in his gubernatorial capacity. . . . The candidate\u2019s statements offered here, though haphazard and reckless, do not rise to that level.\n\nNevertheless, Walker warned that \u201cthis case is not closed and future actions could demand further consideration.\u201d\n\nIn a way, this is a brilliant bit of judicial jujitsu. Scott cannot appeal because the preliminary injunction decision went his way. However, his conduct has been roundly condemned by the federal judge, who put him on notice that if he moves a millimeter in the direction of interfering with the election (e.g., firing officials, ordering a recount be stopped, ordering law enforcement to investigate), he\u2019s in grave danger of being slapped down by the court.\n\nThis decision carries a twofold message. First, Republicans, including Trump, these days are routinely trampling on democratic norms, which are habits of speech and conduct we expect of officials in support of the rule of law and democratic government. \u201cConstitutional alarm bells\u201d should go off when we hear elected officials seeking to undermine faith in elections, the cornerstone of democracy. Second, however, norms are conventions and customs, not laws. Hence, courts have limited ability other than public shaming to enforce these. Norms must be upheld by elected officials, and voters must insist they do so. When voters see elected officials refusing to uphold democratic norms and seeking to destroy the sanctity of elections, they should vote in new officials.\n\nRead more:\n\nJames Downie: Rick Scott\u2019s slimy claim of fraud\n\nCarter Eskew: The Florida fraud redux\n\nDana Milbank: The real fraudster in Florida\n\nMarc A.

Fudge indicated one possibility would be that Pelosi limit herself to two years as speaker.\n\n\u201cWhat she asked me was, basically, \u2018How could we get to a point where I could be supportive?\u2019 \u201d Fudge said. \u201cThe biggest issue that we discussed was the feeling in the caucus of people who are feeling left out and left behind.\u201d\n\n[Does Pelosi have the votes to be speaker?

But an obscure fight buried in the bowels of the derivatives market shows why this complacency is dangerous. Some Wall Street experts see it as a possible harbinger of the next financial crash.\n\nThe fight involves credit-default swaps, which provide a way for traders to insure themselves against the danger that a major institution won\u2019t repay its debts. In principle, these swaps are a healthy feature of the financial system. If Bank A fears Bank B might not repay it, then Bank A can buy credit-default insurance rather than dumping Bank B\u2019s bonds and pulling loans. This avoids choking off Bank B\u2019s access to credit, which in turn would force Bank B to cut lending to businesses and consumers, spreading the damage.\n\nTo manage this insurance market, a 15-member \u201cdeterminations committee\u201d of banks and investors adjudicates the contracts. Its first job is to decide when Bank B has technically defaulted, just as home insurance relies on the police to certify that a robbery has taken place. Next, the committee\u2019s role is to decide which bundles of debt are covered by the insurance. In the case of a robbery, the insurance company will check whether you really did insure your auntie\u2019s antique jewelry. In the case of a complex bankruptcy, bonds issued by some parts of a bankrupt borrower may be covered by a credit-default swap, while bonds issued by other subsidiaries may not.\n\nWhich leads us to the present worry. Last month, the retail giant Sears filed for bankruptcy, signaling that banks and hedge funds that had written credit-default insurance should get ready to pay out. But the real shock came last week, when \u201cintercompany notes\u201d \u2014 that is, debt that one part of Sears owes to another \u2014 showed up on a list of bonds that could be counted as insured. The notes got there because Sears asked that they be included. If they remain, this would by some accounts be the first time that inside debt has been eligible for coverage by credit-default insurance. Unless the expert committee blocks use of the notes at a meeting Thursday, the $11 trillion credit-default market may become a ticking time bomb.\n\nWhy? A company can secretly create intercompany notes in unlimited amounts at no cost to itself: Subsidiary A lends $100 million to Subsidiary B, which promptly lends $100 million back. If this shadowy confetti can be used to make a claim on credit-default insurance, the job of writing that insurance becomes impossible. A home insurer won\u2019t cover your house without asking about its contents. If you scribbled IOUs between you, your spouse and the chihuahua, and the courts upheld your right to large but unspecified payouts in the event of robbery, the home-insurance market would collapse.\n\nIt gets worse. Suppose Bank A is worried about Bank B\u2019s stability and buys credit-default insurance to cover itself. For further protection, Bank A demands that Bank B pledges additional collateral to secure Bank A\u2019s loans. But now Bank B turns the tables on its tormentor. Seeing that Bank A\u2019s credit-default insurance covers bonds issued by a particular Bank B entity, B threatens to use intercompany notes to create a so-called succession event whereby it shuffles its debts to a different part of its empire, rendering A\u2019s insurance worthless. Rattled by this prospect, Bank A backs off its demand for more collateral and is left to contemplate the reality that credit-default insurance provides no real protection.\n\nNow consider the next domino. Because Bank A\u2019s worries about Bank B\u2019s stability are reasonable, Banks C through Z have also bought credit-default swaps to protect themselves. Pretty soon the word gets out that this insurance can be rendered worthless, and panic quickly mounts. Regulators demand that banks raise more capital to make up for the loss of effective default insurance, but with every bank scrambling to raise capital simultaneously, its cost shoots up. At a minimum, banks jack up the cost of loans to everyone from small businesses to home buyers. At a maximum, the freeze in an $11 trillion market creates another Lehman Brothers moment.\n\nFinancial crises often begin with products that seemed reasonable at the outset: special mortgages for borrowers with weak credit, loans to promising emerging markets. Credit-default swaps are benign in principle; indeed, regulators encourage banks to buy them as protection from shocks. But the road leading off the cliff is paved with excellent intentions. If the expert committee makes the wrong call on Thursday, there is a disquieting possibility that the cliff may be in sight."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Philip Bump", "title": "Nearly half of people ages 6 to 21 in the U.S. last year were nonwhite", "description": "In the fast-growing West, young people are as likely to be Hispanic as white.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/nearly-half-of-people-ages-6-to-21-in-the-us-last-year-were-nonwhite/2018/11/16/f9f36694-ace2-42c1-9d4d-b1585f19a936_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:32:09Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nStudents from Vista College Preparatory School cheer on voters during the midterm elections at a polling station in Phoenix on Nov. 6. (Dominic Valente for The Washington Post)\n\nHad the Senate race in Arizona earlier this month come down to only white votes, exit polling suggests that Rep. Martha McSally (R) would have won easily. Among whites, she had an eight-point advantage over Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). Unfortunately for McSally, though, an estimated one-fifth of the electorate in the state was Hispanic, and among those voters, Sinema had a 40-point advantage.\n\nAnd so: Senator-elect Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nThat\u2019s the quiet (and not-so-quiet) fear of many Republican strategists. An America that is becoming consistently less densely white is an America in which the current iteration of the Republican Party is at a growing disadvantage, given the general preference shown by Hispanic and black Americans to Democratic policies and candidates.\n\nBut the problem for the GOP isn\u2019t really about current voters. It\u2019s mostly about future voters. And new data from Pew Research Center shows why that concern is warranted.\n\nPew broke out the population of Americans ages 6 to 21 by demographic. In 2018, it estimates, about 52 percent of people in that age group were white. By contrast, in 1968, young baby boomers were about 82 percent white.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat 52 percent white means, of course, is that 48 percent of those young people are nonwhite.\n\nWe can demonstrate why this is worrisome to the Republican Party in two graphs. The first comes from Pew data released in March, looking at the political identity of those in the millennial generation (a term used by Pew to refer to those born from 1981 to 1996). Among millennials, whites prefer the Democratic to the Republican Party by 11 points. Among nonwhites? The preference is 54 points.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nTufts University political science professor Brian Schaffner used data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study and his own analysis to show how the share of votes earned by Democrats changed by age from 2010 to 2018. In 2010, most young people preferred Democrats, but that preference quickly dropped off. In 2018, according to his analysis, that preference was steady into a significantly older cohort of voters.\n\nHere is a comparison of the relationship between age and the two-party House vote in 2010 and 2018. Republicans are in trouble if that curve keeps shifting to the right. pic.twitter.com/2mjEz9wCxO \u2014 Brian Schaffner (@b_schaffner) November 15, 2018\n\nWhen he warns about the curve \u201cshifting to the right,\u201d he means that the GOP should be concerned that the strong preference for Democratic voters will continue into older and older ages \u2014 in part a function of that strong preference for Democrats among nonwhite Americans, who make up more of the younger population.\n\nEarlier this week, we looked at whether demographic shifts were already aiding the Democratic Party. The shifts themselves, we found, didn\u2019t necessarily translate into more success for Democratic candidates in every state. While every state got less white since the early 1990s, the results by party in any individual state were mixed.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nOverall, though, in those states with the biggest decreases in the density of the white population, voting in Senate and gubernatorial elections did tend to shift to the left.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nHere we\u2019ll share a chart using estimates of the composition of the next Congress based on the results of contests as of Tuesday. It\u2019s not a coincidence, one can assume, that the incoming Democratic caucus is a lot less heavily white than is the Republican one.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nPew\u2019s analysis of the demographic composition of younger people in the United States found that the diversity shift was similarly uneven. In the Midwest, two-thirds of those age 6 to 21 are white. In the West, though, a region that is among the fastest-growing, people in that age group were as likely to be white as Hispanic.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThis, in part, is why the region has grown so fast. Fertility rates among Hispanic women, an estimate of the number of children a woman will have over the span of her life, have been higher than rates among other groups (though that figure dropped in the most recent government analysis).\n\nThere\u2019s another noteworthy aspect to the growth in the density of the Hispanic population among young residents. In 2002, nearly a quarter of young Hispanics in the United States were born outside the country. Now, more than half are born in the United States to immigrant parents.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThere\u2019s an important subtext to that, too: There is a much higher density of young Hispanics now than in 2002 who were born as citizens \u2014 and can therefore vote."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "title": "Here\u2019s what a primary challenge to Trump would accomplish", "description": "It's not exactly a futile and stupid gesture.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/11/16/heres-what-a-primary-challenge-to-trump-would-accomplish/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hFErz9yq021XGJQ6j5x8Y0li4gc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W3PRTMZXSI7SRNYVCWCMOXY7BU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:30:17Z", "content": "I think we have to go all out.

Didn\u2019t the recent midterm elections show there is not much advantage in putting space between yourself and Trump if you want a future in the Republican Party? Well, yes and yes. But like Otter said, sometimes a situation \u201cabsolutely requires\u201d a seemingly hopeless gesture. There are a bunch of reasons as to why I\u2019ve come around to the view that Republicans need one of those gestures right about now.\n\nA primary challenge to Trump would be quite helpful if the goal is to make certain he\u2019s not reelected in 2020.\n\nFirst, there is little downside to the effort. The worst that can happen is what is entirely expected \u2014 Trump would win. While there might be downside to the person challenging Trump, a primary opponent isn\u2019t likely to take Trump on if he\u2019s concerned about playing it safe and husbanding his or her popularity. The primary challenger, if you will, acts like the horse who jumps out to the lead, wears down the favorite and allows his stablemate to come from behind for the victory. And sometimes, the lead horse might actually win. Who\u2019d do this? Maybe someone who already has a job (e.g., Mitt Romney, the Utah senator-elect), or doesn\u2019t need one (e.g., a retired government official), or just thinks it\u2019s the right thing to do (outgoing Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake?). Whoever it is, the person needs to be of sufficient stature to stand up to Trump and able to ridicule and provoke him.\n\nSecond, primaries against a sitting president are funny things. Eugene McCarthy didn\u2019t beat President Lyndon B. Johnson in New Hampshire in 1968; he lost to Johnson by 6 points. But it was a moral victory that sent a collective shudder through the Democratic Party and the White House, prompting Robert F. Kennedy to enter the race and leading to Johnson\u2019s withdrawal a few weeks later. Put differently, you never know what will happen in a dynamic race and what the prospect of losing may have on an unpopular, besieged incumbent president.\n\nThird, this week has reminded us that Trump cannot handle the pressure of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III breathing down his neck, coupled with the prospect of congressional scrutiny. Imagine if Mueller indicts Donald Trump Jr. or proves that Trump aide Roger Stone was plotting with WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange. Think about what Trump will do in the event of a damning Mueller report. It\u2019s not out of the question that he will \u201close it\u201d \u2014 really lose it \u2014 and do something that convinces even Republicans he cannot hold up for a campaign, let alone a second term. He might try pardoning everyone in sight and/or leave, demanding that Vice President Pence pardon them all. We\u2019ll see what happens, as Trump likes to say.\n\nFourth, a primary run doesn\u2019t preclude a third-party run by a different candidate, most likely a moderate candidate in the event Trump wins the GOP nomination. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, visiting in New Hampshire, explained the ideal circumstances for such a run. My colleague David Weigel writes, \u201cKasich was speculating on what it would take to break the two-party system wide open. He imagined a 2020 matchup between Trump and a left-wing Democrat that would create \u2018a vast ocean between the parties.\u2019 \u201d The decision to mount a third-party run could wait until after both parties pick their nominee; but if Trump falters in the primary, nothing would stop Kasich (or anyone else) from entering the race. (For now, Kasich occupies an enviable position. A non-candidate with high name ID can continue to criticize Trump and urge his fellow Republicans to hold Trump accountable for his rhetoric and actions.)\n\nIn short, those fearful of a second Trump term should welcome any and all chances to knock him out before the general election. If he, nevertheless, makes it to the general election, either a moderate Democrat or a third-party centrist would likely have the best chance of beating him.\n\nYou see, running against Trump in a primary may not be so futile or stupid after all."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Tales Azzoni | AP", "title": "Spain doubted again after consecutive Nations League losses", "description": "The hype surrounding Luis Enrique and his Spain team didn\u2019t last very long", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/spain-doubted-again-after-consecutive-nations-league-losses/2018/11/16/7fe4b316-e9bc-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:27:25Z", "content": "MADRID The hype surrounding Luis Enrique and his Spain team didnt last very long.

(Darko Bandic/Associated Press)\n\nMADRID \u2014 The hype surrounding Luis Enrique and his Spain team didn\u2019t last very long.\n\nDisappointing performances in the UEFA Nations League have left \u201cLa Roja\u201d under scrutiny after what had been a promising start under the new coach.\n\nLuis Enrique was hired to revamp the national team following its early World Cup elimination. He led Spain to impressive victories, including a 2-1 victory over England at Wembley Stadium, a 6-0 win against World Cup-finalist Croatia and a 4-1 victory over Wales in a friendly in Cardiff.\n\nBoth in attack and defense, the team was playing well again. And the solid performances got fans excited about the team\u2019s future.\n\nBut the great start was followed by two straight losses: 3-2 to England in Spain\u2019s first home defeat in 15 years, and 3-2 at Croatia on Thursday after conceding in stoppage time. The results left Spain having to hope for a draw between England and Croatia at Wembley on Sunday to be able to advance to the final four of Europe\u2019s newest competition.\n\n\u201cThe results are what they are,\u201d Luis Enrique said. \u201cThe group was very difficult, with two of the best national teams in the world. We were less favorites but the first two matches went really well. I\u2019m happy with how we played even though there are things to improve.\u201d\n\nLuis Enrique implemented some promising changes in his first two matches in charge, making Spain press high and play a more aggressive style. The \u201ctiki-taka\u201d passing game was gone, and the focus turned to a more vertical approach in attack.\n\nBut the high defensive line that worked well in the first two games, allowing the team to play aggressively, made Spain become more vulnerable on defense. The team conceded six goals in its last two matches after outscoring opponents 12-2 in the first matches under Luis Enrique.\n\nThe former Barcelona coach said this inconsistency was expected considering Spain is still in the process of replacing the golden generation which helped Spain win two European Championships and a World Cup.\n\n\u201cWe already knew the situation with a change in generation and we are trying to create a team,\u201d Luis Enrique said. \u201cThere are young players who need confidence and there is a lot of room for improvement.\u201d\n\nLuis Enrique is not able to count on the likes of Andres Iniesta, David Silva and Gerard Pique, who retired from the national team after the World Cup. He has been gradually experimenting with youngsters.\n\nHe will have a chance to get Spain back on track in a friendly against Bosnia-Herzegovina on Sunday in Las Palmas, the team\u2019s final match of the year. The hosts will be without defender Sergio Ramos, who will be rested because of a muscle ailment.\n\nLuis Enrique said he is already planning on getting the team ready for Euro 2020 qualifying, which begins next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d Luis Enrique said. \u201cI\u2019d love to see England and Croatia draw so we could play in the final four (of the Nations League), but our goal is the European Championship and to qualify for the tournament with a group of young players.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nIn the months before they return to the majority in the House, Democrats there are sparring about who will lead them. The disagreement about who should be House speaker and the de facto face of the party is pretty much in line with the debate about the future of the broader Democratic Party.\n\nWith a younger and more ethnically diverse group of representatives, some lawmakers feel Democratic leadership should reflect those who supported Democratic candidates most in this past election or the voters that the party continues to lose to the GOP. Others wonder whether the party should be led by a voice that is less polarizing and not as much of a target as its current leader.\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been a convenient boogeyman for Republicans since her last stint as speaker. One of President Trump\u2019s and his party\u2019s midterm strategies was to tie all Democrats to the liberal lawmaker from San Francisco.\n\nA vote for Claire McCaskill is a vote for Schumer, Pelosi, Waters, and their socialist agenda.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2018\n\nThis approach probably worked with some voters fearful of growing influence from the left, but ultimately Pelosi was a big factor in leading her party to retaking the House, an argument some are using to support her remaining in leadership \u2014 including herself.\n\nShe told the media Thursday:\n\n\u201cI have overwhelming support in my caucus to be speaker of the House. I happen to think at this point, I\u2019m the best person for that.\u201d\n\nMany Democratic lawmakers campaigned on promises that they would not back Pelosi in her quest to continue leading House Democrats \u2014 or a least dodging questions about it. As of now, a number of incumbent Democrats have vowed to vote against her, some going so far as to sign a pledge solidifying their lack of support, claiming that it is time for a new voice to lead the party.\n\n[Does Pelosi have the votes to become speaker? Here's what Democrats have said.]\n\nOf the 17 members and incoming members of Congress who signed a letter saying they plan to vote against Pelosi even on the House floor on Jan. 3, most of them are white men with quite a few representing districts in red states with solid numbers of the white working-class voters. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who once called Pelosi more \u201ctoxic\u201d than Trump, is one of the more visible voices of this wing of the party.\n\nBut left-leaning Democratic strategists have argued that recent Democratic victories have come about because of women, people of color, millennials and LGBTQ voters often in more urban areas \u2014 not white working-class men in the heartland \u2014 and that the party\u2019s leadership should reflect that. They took to Twitter on Wednesday to criticize her opponents using the hashtag #FiveWhiteGuys to highlight that the leaders of the anti-Pelosi movement are all white men, thus comparing their identities to the current House Republican conference.\n\nSo #fivewhiteguys are following the tactics of the right wing white guy Freedom Caucus to block a woman speaker after an election in which women saved the Democrats. Got it. https://t.co/9IBz59Ryo3 \u2014 Joan Walsh (@joanwalsh) November 14, 2018\n\nSome point to black women being underrepresented in Democratic leadership despite the fact that black women are one of the party\u2019s most loyal demographic groups. This is probably in part why Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, is considering running against Pelosi.\n\n\u201cPeople are asking me to do it, and I am thinking about it,\u201d Fudge told Cleveland.com. \u201cI need to give it some thought and see if I have an interest. I am at the very beginning of this process. It is just in discussion at this point.\u201d\n\nAnother argument against Pelosi is that Democrats' leadership should be younger, given the large number of millennials and Generation Xers recently sent to Congress. But new lawmakers such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have spent more of their first week advocating for the issues that matter most to their voters than calling for Pelosi\u2019s ouster.\n\n\u201cShould Leader Pelosi become the next speaker of the House, we need to tell her that we\u2019ve got her back in showing and pursuing the most progressive energy agenda that this country has ever seen,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, according to a video posted on Twitter by the environmental group Sunrise Movement, which organized a protest outside the minority leader\u2019s office this week. Ocasio-Cortez has not said whether she\u2019ll support Pelosi.\n\nSince the Democratic Party\u2019s loss in the 2016 election, there has been significant debate over who should be the next leader to defeat the Republican agenda in coming years. After Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton failed to win white men, especially those from more conservative and working-class backgrounds, some argued that the left should prioritize these voters. Others claimed that the future of the party was recognizing those groups who had been most faithful to liberal politicians and to make sure that leadership and the Democratic Party\u2019s agenda reflected that.

In at least two cases, family members mistakenly filled out another household member\u2019s ballot.\n\nAll told, more than 5,000 absentee ballots in Georgia, or a little more than 2 percent of the nearly 230,000 ballots mailed in by the state\u2019s voters, were rejected by elections officials for a variety of reasons, according to data maintained by the office of the Georgia secretary of state. Statewide the percentage of rejected ballots isn\u2019t much different from 2016. But because of the razor-thin margin in the state\u2019s still-contested governor\u2019s race, additional scrutiny is being paid this year to how ballots get counted and rejected, and numerous lawsuits are challenging the criteria by which some ballots have been tossed out.\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Christopher Ingraham for the Washington Post)\n\nMost of the state\u2019s rejected absentee ballots are concentrated in the region around Atlanta, as is Georgia\u2019s population overall. But the distribution of rejections around Atlanta isn\u2019t uniform, as the map above shows. Fulton County, the heart of the Atlanta metropolitan area, rejected 1 out of more than 17,000 submitted absentee ballots, according to the secretary of state\u2019s data file. Nearby Gwinnett County received a similar number of ballots, 20,000, but rejected nearly 1,600, or more than 7 percent of them.\n\nFulton County officials say their low rate of absentee ballot rejection is no accident. \u201cWe only reject if the voter fails to sign the Oath or if the signature is so different that we are confident is was signed by someone else,\u201d said Rick Barron, director of the Fulton County Department of Registration and Elections, in an email. \u201cWe don\u2019t reject for missing DoB or miscellaneous information.\u201d\n\nThe difference between Fulton County and Gwinnett County, in other words, boils down to deliberate policy decisions made by county officials. Disparities like those are troubling to voting rights advocates, who have accused Gwinnett County officials of rejecting absentee ballots for \u201clargely trivial reasons.\u201d Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, said in an interview that some counties in Georgia are seeing \u201ca truly eyebrow-raising number of ballots being rejected\u201d this election cycle.\n\nThose rejections have spawned a number of lawsuits. Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled that all counties in Georgia must accept absentee ballots with incorrect or missing birth dates. That follows a ruling in October that prevented Georgia counties from throwing out ballots solely because of signature mismatches.\n\nInitial rejections because of signature mismatches and other identification-related issues were common, according to the secretary of state\u2019s data. A little more than half of the absentee rejections in Georgia cited unspecified problems with the oath section of the absentee envelope, where voters attest to their identity by entering their signature, date of birth and home address.\n\nAmong the rejected ballots for which officials cited more specific identification-related reasons, problems with the birth date were the most common issue, responsible for 738 rejections statewide. Much of that appears to be attributable to poor ballot design, according to Sean J. Young, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia. On many ballots, the \u201cbirth date line is very close to the signature line,\u201d Young said. Many voters may have misread that part of the envelope and assumed they were supposed to enter the current date, as is customary with important documents, Young said.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s data file suggests that was particularly an issue in Gwinnett County, where nearly all the birthdate-related rejections were located. At least 160 ballots were rejected in Gwinnett County because voters entered the current year where their year of birth should have been.\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Christopher Ingraham for the Washington Post)\n\nGwinnett was also the location of disproportionate numbers of signature mismatches and address problems, according to the secretary of state\u2019s data. But there were other issues with ballots, too. Nearly 1,000 absentee ballots were rejected simply because they arrived at elections offices after Nov. 6. Unlike some other states, which require absentee ballots to be postmarked by Election Day, Georgia requires that absentee ballots arrive by Election Day.\n\nElections officials also reported that they attempted to send out at least 149 ballots to would-be voters, only to have those blank ballots returned by the Post Office as undeliverable.\n\nThere are a number of rejections that don\u2019t fall neatly into any particular category. Some people put their ballots into incorrect envelopes. At least one wrote a write-in candidate on a separate piece of paper. Several voters were determined to be deceased. One man in the town of Thomaston forgot to put his ballot in his envelope. A Savannah woman\u2019s spouse voted using her ballot.\n\nGenerally speaking, states' various absentee balloting systems run smoothly. In 2016, for instance, voters cast more than 33 million absentee ballots in the presidential election, according to the federal Election Assistance Commission. Just 319,000 \u2014 less than 1 percent of them \u2014 were rejected by election authorities.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s Young says that in Georgia, \u201cthe absentee ballot problems seem to be magnified this year.\u201d He blames the issue, in part, on authorities' not allocating sufficient resources to deal with the extremely high turnout generated by this year\u2019s election. \u201cIn my view, that has been the cornerstone of a lot of these problems we\u2019re hearing about. This is all due to election officials either intentionally or indifferently failing to provide enough staffing to run an election.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "6 convicted for 2016 Istanbul airport attack that killed 45", "description": "Turkey's state-run news agency says a court in Istanbul has sentenced six people to life in prison for their involvement in a deadly Islamic State group attack on Istanbul's main airport in 2016", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/6-convicted-for-2016-istanbul-airport-attack-that-killed-45/2018/11/16/8d2c49c0-e9b8-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:59:09Z", "content": "ISTANBUL Turkeys state-run news agency says a court in Istanbul has sentenced six people to life in prison for their involvement in a deadly Islamic State group attack on Istanbuls main airport in 2016.

Radovich made it to the Pro Bowl in his rookie season, 1938, with the Detroit Lions. Around a three-year stint in the Navy during World War II, he played six more seasons, the penultimate of which was a first-team all-pro performance with the Los Angeles Dons, before retiring after 1947.\n\nRadovich\u2019s career has not been noted by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. But years ago, he was imprinted at the players\u2019 union because in 1949 he became the first player to sue the NFL for the right to play for more money and where he wanted, just like most of us who aren\u2019t professional athletes can do.\n\nSomeday, maybe, former Pittsburgh Steelers running back Le\u2019Veon Bell will be embossed next to Radovich in the union\u2019s Dupont Circle office.\n\nAfter all, what Bell decided to do Tuesday was claim ownership of his destiny rather than allow the NFL or the franchise for which he plays to dictate it for him. Having refused to play all season because he was unable to get terms he liked, Bell didn\u2019t show up at Steelers headquarters to sign a one-year franchise-player contract to play this year. NFL franchise-player contracts pay a predetermined salary based on the average of the top five salaries at the player\u2019s position, or 120 percent of a player\u2019s salary from the previous season. Per league rules, the Steelers\u2019 offer expired at the end of that day. And so did Bell\u2019s last chance to play for anyone this season.\n\n[After Le\u2019Veon Bell fails to report, Steelers teammates raid his locker]\n\nAs Radovich did almost 70 years ago, Bell opted to challenge the league to let a club pay him his worth rather than as an expendable, flesh-and-blood cog under the franchise tag again. Had Bell, just 26, blown out a knee and ended his career, his short window to earn NFL millions would have slammed shut, just like that. Employed as a running back, he already was playing the position with the shortest career span \u2014 because of injury and wear and tear \u2014 in the NFL. Bell protested for long-term salary insurance.\n\n\u201cThe average running back is not wildly overpaid,\u201d Michael Roach, a Middle Tennessee State economist who wrote a study on labor market efficiency by position in the NFL, underscored to me Thursday. \u201c[The NFL has] devalued the position.\u201d\n\nSo much so that Pro Football Focus this year found that, on average, only kickers and punters get paid less . That has to change. The only way it will is for a player such as Bell to stand against it \u2014 and get others to follow.\n\nRoach studied the impact of players missing games and found that offensive talent affected a team\u2019s performance more than defensive talent and that running backs were more valuable for myriad reasons than wide receivers but not as valuable as quarterbacks or linemen. Bell\u2019s performance suggested he hasn\u2019t been relied upon just as a prolific runner but as a prolific receiver, too. When quarterback Ben Roethlisberger couldn\u2019t find a receiver to throw to last season, he often tossed the ball to Bell, who \u2014 as we say in sports parlance \u2014 turned nothing into something.\n\nAs such, Bell was worth more than the one-year deal the Steelers offered. Though it would have paid Bell more than any other running back, it also would have been less than several defensive players, who Roach\u2019s study indicated are less valuable than offensive players.\n\nLast we saw Bell, in 2017, he was handed and caught a football more than any other running back: 406 times for 1,946 yards and 11 touchdowns. He told ESPN\u2019s Jeremy Fowler last month: \u201cI want to play. I want to win games and the playoffs. But I\u2019ve got to take this stand. Knowing my worth and knowing I can tear a ligament or get surgery at any time, I knew I couldn\u2019t play 16 games with 400 or more touches.\u201d\n\n[Aaron Donald, \u2018285 pounds of dynamite,\u2019 is NFL\u2019s ultimate outlier in an offense-heavy season]\n\nAt the same age Bell is now, DeMarco Murray in 2014 set a Dallas Cowboys record with 449 touches, including 392 carries. He was at the end of his rookie contract, and the Cowboys let him seek a bigger contract elsewhere. After three more seasons between Philadelphia and Tennessee, having watched his per-carry average dip nearly a yard, Murray called it a career.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cthe last year or two, and physically, mentally and emotionally, I think it\u2019s time for me to hang it up.\u201d\n\nHe was 30. In seven seasons, he made $16 million in salary and $9 million in bonuses and incentives. The Cowboys paid him the least and got the most out of him. Bell took a stand to flip that equation.\n\nSomehow, the Steelers have withstood Bell\u2019s absence. After a shaky start, they have reeled off five wins in a row to take control of their division with a 6-2-1 record. Their schedule is about to toughen, though.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably good for the Steelers and Bell if they parted ways,\u201d Roach said. \u201cThe Steelers\u2019 drop-off with [understudy James] Conner hasn\u2019t been great, so Bell might be more valuable to another team.\u201d\n\nThat might explain some of the good-riddance messages from Bell\u2019s teammates. They feel as if they have proved they don\u2019t need him and that what appeared to be broken promises about returning to the team meant he couldn\u2019t be trusted.\n\nOne of Bell\u2019s star teammates, wide receiver Antonio Brown, even was reported to have unfollowed Bell on Instagram. But this isn\u2019t really about Bell. His decision wasn\u2019t narcissistic; it could, in fact, prove to be socialistic.\n\nEvery NFL player should champion him. Like long-forgotten Bill Radovich, he dared to do what is in the best interest of them all.\n\nKevin B.

The information listed in the Green Book \u2014 hotels, motels, cafes and restaurants that welcomed black people \u2014 could literally mean life or death for black travelers.\n\nBlack travelers who ended up in the wrong place, wrong hotel, wrong street or wrong town were sometimes beaten, shot, pulled from their cars and dragged out of town. A wrong turn could lead to an encounter with the Ku Klux Klan. Bad timing or bad information could lead a driver into a \u201csundown town,\u201d cities, towns and communities across the country where African Americans were not permitted after nightfall. Some of those towns had warning signs at their borders: \u201cN-----, Don\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on You.\u201d\n\n\u201cSundown towns were throughout the country; they were everywhere, even on Route 66,\u201d Candacy Taylor, a Harvard fellow and cultural documentarian working on a project about the Green Book, told The Washington Post.\n\n[\u2018Fearless\u2019 Ida B. Wells fought racial terrorism]\n\n\u201cWhen you have that reality, you need a guide. You need something to tell you where you could stay that was safe. \u2026 There were lynchings still happening.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe guidebook for African American travelers was published from 1936 to 1964 by Victor H. Green. (Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture/New York Public Library)\n\nIn 1936, Victor H. Green, a postal worker who lived in Harlem with his wife, Alma, encountered discrimination during a car trip. Green decided to begin publishing \u201cThe Negro Motorist Green-Book.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust What You Have Been Looking For!!\u201d Green wrote in the first edition. \u201cNow We Can Travel Without Embarrassment.\u201d\n\nThe Green Book was not just for travel through the South or Midwest but also printed listings in the West and in Northern cities where segregation and discrimination were also common.\n\nThe first Green Book documented safe places in metropolitan New York. It listed hotels, tourist homes, service stations, restaurants, garages, taxicabs, beauty parlors, barbershops, tailors, drugstores, taverns, nightclubs and funeral homes that welcomed black people at a time in the country when it was legal for establishments to discriminate based on race.\n\n[When Portland banned blacks: Oregon\u2019s shameful history as an \u2018all-white\u2019 state]\n\nThe response to the first guide was so great that the next issue went national, offering listings across the United States. Over the years, the price varied \u2014 some cost 75 cents, others $1.50. Salespeople helped distribute the copies. Customers could also order the guidebook in Green\u2019s Harlem office.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re traveling you don\u2019t have to worry about accommodations \u2014 whether this place will take you in or that place will sell you food. That is if you\u2019re white and gentile. If you\u2019re not, you have to travel a careful route like seeking oases in a desert,\u201d an ad in the 1949 edition of the Green Book said.\n\nExcept during World War II, the Green Book guide was published annually until 1967, three years after the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act, said Maira Liriano. She is the associate chief librarian at the Jean Blackwell Hutson Research and Reference Division in the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, which is part of New York Public Library. Twenty-two Green Books have been digitized there. (The 1966-67 issue is not digitized because of copyright concerns. But the library has a physical copy.)\n\n\u201cAfter the Civil Rights Act is passed, you can\u2019t discriminate on race,\u201d Liriano told The Post. \u201cAfrican Americans could go to any hotel and restaurant and couldn\u2019t be turned away. Once it was the law of land, the Green Book was not necessary.\u201d\n\nThe Schomburg has the largest collection of Green Books in the country. \u201cThere are other guides,\u201d Liriano said. \u201cBut none were published as long as the Green Book.\u201d The \u201cHackley & Harrison\u2019s Hotel and Apartment Guide for Colored Travelers: Board, Rooms, Garage Accommodations, etc. in 300 Cities in the United States and Canada\u201d was published twice, in 1930 and 1931.\n\nIn the 1949 edition of the Green Book, Wendell P. Alston, a special representative to Esso Standard Oil Co., which became a major distributor of the Green Book, explained just how crucial the Green Book was for African American travelers.\n\nFor most travelers, Alston wrote, \u201cthere are hotels of all sizes and classes, waiting and competing for their patronage. Pleasure resorts in the mountains and at the sea shore beckon him. Roadside Inns and cabins spot the highways and all are available if he has the price.\u201d\n\nBut for black travelers, many of those facilities were simply unavailable.\n\n\u201cThe Negro traveler\u2019s inconveniences are many, and they are increasing because today so many more are traveling, individually and in groups,\u201d Alston wrote. The ranks of black travelers, he said, included musicians, entertainers, students, teachers and business executives.\n\nThe Green Book offered a way to sidestep danger and humiliation, listing hotels and businesses from New York City to Birmingham, Ala.\n\nIn the movie \u201cGreen Book,\u201d one of the first stops Shirley and his chauffeur make is in Kentucky. The movie shows the chauffeur pulling over at a roadside Kentucky Fried Chicken, then sharing a bucket with Shirley, who professes not to know how to eat fried chicken without a knife and fork.\n\n[How Peter Farrelly ended up directing a smart drama about racism]\n\nIf they were looking at a 1962 edition Green Book, they would have found very few listings for eating establishments and hotels in Kentucky that welcomed black people.\n\nIf they stopped in Bowling Green, Ky., they would have found only one hotel advertised for black patrons: the Hotel Southern Queen on State Street, Hwy 31.\n\nHad they traveled to Elizabethtown, they could have stayed in the only place listed: the home of Mrs. B. Tyler on Niles Street.\n\nIn Lexington, there were four listings that would have accommodated Shirley: The Greystone Motel on Race Street; the Huggins Service Center; the home of Mrs. K. Wallace; and the home of Mrs. Nancy Griffin.\n\nIn Louisville, the Green Book listed nine options for black travelers: the Brown Derby Lounge; Elite Tavern & Grill; Frank\u2019s Service Station; Hook\u2019s Hotel; Mickey\u2019s Bar & Grill; the Allen Hotel; Turner\u2019s Drive; and the YMCA or YWCA.\n\n\n\nThe Green Book was published from 1936 to 1964 by Victor H. Green. (Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture/New York Public Library)\n\nGreen, the founder of the Green Book, longed for a country where the listings would be unnecessary.\n\n\u201cThere will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published,\u201d Green wrote in one introduction. \u201cThat is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States. It will be a great day for us to suspend this publication for then we can go wherever we please, and without embarrassment. But until that time comes we shall continue to publish this information for your convenience each year.\u201d\n\nGreen died in 1960, four years before the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act \u2014 which included a prohibition against discrimination in public accommodations.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nThe Civil War massacre that left nearly 200 black soldiers \u2018murdered\u2019\n\nMissouri v.

(Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune via AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nLinda L. Fowler writes for Foreign Affairs:\n\nOver the last few decades, political and institutional barriers have sprung up that could block any serious review of foreign policy and defense decisions. Despite a daunting array of problems around the world, the 2018 elections turned on domestic issues and disapproval of President Donald Trump. International relations barely registered as a problem in opinion polls, a fact that may diminish enthusiasm for major inquiries. Moreover, the House defense and foreign policy committees will have to compete with other committees for media attention. And they can expect rival inquiries from Republicans in the Senate and vigorous attacks from a president adept at distracting the public and the press from substance.\n\nWhen they do conduct hearings, hyper-partisanship prompts chairmen to push scandals and pseudo-scandals at the expense of more substantive issues. (\u201cPresident Barack Obama ordered several shifts in U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Iraq,\u201d Fowler notes, \u201cbut the committees\u2019 reactions were relatively muted. Instead, their efforts skewed heavily toward imposing political costs on the Obama administration, particularly with repeated inquiries into the Benghazi attacks in 2012.\u201d)\n\nFowler recommends Congress \u201cengage authoritative, trusted witnesses to tell compelling stories that people will see as relevant to their lives. Productive oversight hearings play out over weeks or months, so they require patience and discipline from members of Congress, who must resist the impulse to chase after every headline.\u201d\n\nIn the House, the very able Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) will take over chairmanship of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. While the prospects for serious oversight in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are not great given that Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho), among the most strident apologists for Trump, is in line to assume the chairmanship from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).\n\nNevertheless, three serious areas of policy oversight should draw bipartisan attention.\n\nFirst, Congress needs to examine our relationship with the Saudis given their entirely insufficient response to the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, who was a Global Opinions columnist for The Post. This newspaper reports there is hope for significant action from Congress:\n\nMany in Congress have accused the administration of placing its desire to maintain close relations with Saudi Arabia \u2014 particularly with its senior leadership \u2014 above a serious response to the Khashoggi case and the war in Yemen, where U.S.-aided Saudi airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians and caused widespread starvation. A sweeping proposal to increase congressional oversight and suspend U.S. weapons sales to the Saudis was introduced Thursday by a bipartisan group of senior senators.\n\nNot only did the Saudis change their account of the murder, but also they and the Trump administration stop short of implicating Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and senior intelligence officials, who most experts on Saudi Arabia believe must have approved a plot of this magnitude. Moreover, the Saudis\u2019 latest version of the story appears to contradict available evidence.\n\nHere is an opportunity not only to obtain testimony from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and CIA Director Gina Haspel (whom Corker admonished \u201cto share with us exactly what is happening with the U.S. response to Saudi Arabia\u201d) about the murder. It is also an opportunity to seek information about Trump\u2019s and Jared Kushner\u2019s conflicts of interest, the human disaster unfolding in Yemen (made possible by U.S. support for the Saudis) and the dangers in continued overreliance on a brutal, repressive regime to defend our interests (e.g., challenging Iran) in the Middle East. (Have we learned nothing from backing Hosni Mubarak in Egypt?).\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that Sens. Corker, Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) are united \u2014 in this case on the necessity of much stronger action against the Saudis.\n\nA second area for congressional oversight must be the war in Afghanistan, nearing the 20-year mark. While one administration after another has put the best face on our policy, it\u2019s far from clear we are any closer to \u201cwinning\u201d or that \u201cwinning\u201d is even in the cards. Moreover, as negotiations drag on, the Taliban still engages in military operations resulting in massive fatalities. (\u201cThe events from Sunday, where dozens of Afghan special forces troops were killed and a loyal and peaceful province appears about to be ravaged, shouldn\u2019t surprise us,\u201d Shazar Shafqat writes in the Hill newspaper. \u201cThe failure of the security apparatus the U.S. forces helped build is apparent.\u201d)\n\nIf this shouldn\u2019t surprise us, it\u2019s fair to ask why we are sending Americans to die there. Michael Rubin (no relation) of the American Enterprise Institute wrote in August:\n\nA succession of U.S. commanders (Joseph Dunford, David Petraeus, and Gen. John Nicholson , most notably) have put far more positive spin on the situation in Afghanistan and their own contributions than was merited, even as an objective view of reality showed the holdings of the Afghan government faltering. Both George W. Bush and then Obama were willing to place diplomatic wishful thinking above reality with regard to Pakistan\u2019s role sponsoring Taliban and al Qaeda terror. Can a new general or commander repair the problem? Alas, no \u2014 at least not without a massive change in strategy and commitment to win. There is an arrogance in Washington, D.C., which believes that every administration can start with a tabula rasa. Military analysts conduct war games and craft new plans, and diplomats try to reach out to new partners to find that elusive magic formula. Almost every policymaker passionate about Afghanistan and victory of the Taliban seeks more money.\n\nIn Rubin\u2019s view, we\u2019ve missed our window of opportunity. \u201cThe U.S. had a unique opportunity to win in Afghanistan in the first years after Sept. 11 but squandered it through poor strategy and diplomatic naivete,\u201d he argues. \u201cThere is no sign that Washington or its allies are willing to show the 50 percent of Afghans who were born after mujahedeen civil war or Taliban repression that the new Afghanistan offers them a better alternative.\u201d\n\nPerhaps there really is cause for optimism and continued patience, but Congress has an obligation to find out with comprehensive, tough oversight.\n\nFinally, Congress needs to find out whether the Singapore summit between Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un accomplished anything and what the purpose of another summit would be. CNN reports:\n\nNorth Korea has tested a \u201cnewly developed ultramodern\u201d weapon in an event supervised by leader Kim Jong Un, state media said Friday, amid faltering nuclear disarmament negotiations with the United States.\n\nVery little is known about the weapon or whether it is even new, but the test is the latest sign that Pyongyang is prepared to return to a more militaristic relationship with Washington if talks continue to go poorly. \u201cHe\u2019s tiptoeing towards a more aggressive posture in negotiations with the US and he\u2019s signaling that he\u2019s not going to give way and can simply return to his old practices if (the US) don\u2019t change their approach,\u201d Josh Pollack, senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterrey, told CNN.\n\nOther reports suggest we are turning a blind eye toward North Korea\u2019s missile advances. (The New York Times reports, \u201cNorth Korea is moving ahead with its ballistic missile program at 16 hidden bases that have been identified in new commercial satellite images, a network long known to American intelligence agencies but left undiscussed as President Trump claims to have neutralized the North\u2019s nuclear threat.\u201d)\n\nWhat happened to \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d? And if the heat is really on Pyongyang, why is North Korea showing no sign of backing off its nuclear ambitions? It\u2019s time for straight answers and, if need be, additional sanctions if the current policy is not working.\n\nIn sum, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and North Korea may not have the media attraction that Trump\u2019s ethics scandals do, but these are critical matters. What could be more important than determining whether an ongoing war is fruitless and unnecessarily sacrificing American lives? Congressional oversight on foreign policy needs to move up the list of priorities in the next Congress.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Saudi Arabia\u2019s latest account of Khashoggi\u2019s death is shocking in its audacity\n\nGeorge F.

I predicted a recession that has not materialized, thanks mostly to a central bank stimulus and a strong world economy. I predicted the destabilization of the Western alliance, but with President Trump as destabilizer in chief, Britain is a rounding error. Yet in some respects my pessimism was, if anything, too mild. As of Thursday afternoon in London, two cabinet members, two junior ministers and four other aides had resigned their government positions. The obstacles to a reasonable exit deal have proved as bad as anything I imagined, and the resulting political chaos is dizzying.\n\nIn 2016, the expectation of chaos was ridiculed by the Brexit gang that won the referendum. To cite four leading Brexiters who later held cabinet positions: Britain would \u201chold all the cards\u201d in negotiations with the European Union; it could \u201chave our cake and eat it\u201d; a replacement trade deal with the E.U. would yield \u201cthe exact same benefits\u201d; and the bargaining would be \u201cthe easiest in human history.\u201d Once Britain freed itself from the shackles of the E.U., it would conclude wonderful new trade deals of its own and rapidly emerge as the Singapore of Europe.\n\nNow the government has published a draft exit treaty. It is as long as a Dickens novel and far more confusing. The most controversial portion concerns the Irish \u201cbackstop,\u201d which would kick in at the end of a transition period unless Britain managed to negotiate an unexpectedly deep trade deal with Europe. To avoid a destabilizing hard border between Northern Ireland and the independent Republic of Ireland, the backstop provides that the North would live by Europe\u2019s rules on food products and goods standards, even though the United Kingdom would have lost all influence over those rules\u2019 content.\n\nMeanwhile, to minimize trade barriers between the North and mainland Britain, the mainland would remain within the E.U. Customs Union. This would prevent it from negotiating its own separate free-trade deals; so much for the vision of Britain as Singapore. What\u2019s more, Britain would not be allowed to shake off this restraint without the E.U.\u2019s approval, and the European Court of Justice would adjudicate customs disputes. So much for the Brexiters\u2019 promise of enhanced British sovereignty.\n\nThe political whirlwind has come quickly. The very Brexiters who promised a cakewalk are denouncing the result of their own policy. The latest spate of resignations comes on top of the two senior Brexiters who quit in July. Prime Minister Theresa May deliberately installed committed Euroskeptics as Brexit ministers; both her successive choices have now left in disgust at a diplomatic effort they had theoretically been leading. As a Brit living in the United States, I used to marvel at Americans who revered their Constitution yet despaired at the political process that it produced. Now, as a naturalized American living in London, I have watched a political movement passionately advance a radical objective \u2014 and then decry the consequences of its own radicalism.\n\nWhat happens next is unknown even to the participants. The Brexit purists are threatening to topple the prime minister. But installing a new leader involves a protracted two-stage process: The parliamentary caucus of the ruling Conservative Party must come up with a short list of two candidates, then rank-and-file Conservatives must vote on them. Meanwhile, time is running short. Britain will crash out of the E.U. in March unless it can ratify a divorce treaty before then.\n\nWhether or not it gets a new leader, the Conservative Party faces four options. The first is to push the prime minister\u2019s deal through Parliament, but for now it seems to lack the votes for that. The second is to try to break the logjam by calling an election, but this would pose a risk that the Labour Party, now firmly rooted on the far left, would take power, so the Conservatives are unlikely to go there. The third option is to leave the E.U. without a deal. But this would risk such chaos \u2014 empty shelves in supermarkets, 20-mile traffic jams at new border checks \u2014 that most Conservatives won\u2019t want that, either.\n\nThe fourth option is a new referendum. This would be cumbersome to organize and uncertain in its outcome, but at least it might deliver a sense of closure for the nation. The parliamentary process has generated a compromise that is pleasing to no one. If it is implemented, Brexiters will spin a myth that they were betrayed by bureaucrats and Eurocrats and the establishment writ large: Their populism will grow even more poisonous. A second vote would give the Leave camp an opportunity to vote for a cleaner break with the E.U., even if it came at the expense of Ireland. It would also give Remainers a chance to make the argument for solving the whole Brexit problem by staying in the E.U. Then the nightmare would be over."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "The Heat's Hassan Whiteside discovers what happens when you leave a $50000 assault rifle in an unlocked Rolls-Royce - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post The Heat's Hassan Whiteside discovers what happens when you leave a $50000 assault rifle in an unlocked Rolls-Royce Washington Post Here's a Friday hypothetical for you: Let's say you purchase something that costs $50,000.

What\u2019s the first thing you do with it when you\u2019re not using it? You lock it up, right?\n\nMiami Heat center Hassan Whiteside did not lock it up, and it wasn\u2019t a $50,000 piece of jewelry. Rather, he had a just-purchased Colt M16 assault rifle stolen from his unlocked Rolls-Royce in July.\n\nAndy Slater of 640 AM in Miami has the scoop after reviewing the police report. On July 5, Whiteside purchased the rifle, ammunition, a rifle bag and a silencer at a Miami gun shop and then went for a workout at the University of Miami, leaving his Rolls unlocked. But the next day at home, he noticed that the weapon and the rifle bag were missing and called the police, thinking it had been stolen at the workout. But a review of security footage ruled that out, and then Whiteside remembered that he also had left his car unlocked at the gun store with the rifle inside. Going off that, police determined that the firearm had been stolen there after Whiteside went back inside the store for a moment.\n\nOn July 23, Slater reports, police recovered the rifle and the silencer in a stolen vehicle in North Miami.\n\n\u201cI have a license for the gun that was stolen from me over the summer,\u201d Whiteside said Thursday in a team-issued statement, per the Miami Herald. \u201cI should have secured it better and I\u2019m glad it was recovered.

The NBA\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement only prohibits players from carrying firearms \u201cat a facility or venue owned, operated, or being used by a Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity, and whenever a player is traveling on any NBA-related business.\u201d The CBA also mandates that gun-possessing players provide their teams with proof of legal registration or licensing at the start of each season.\n\nRead more NBA coverage:\n\nDraymond Green tries to squash his beef with Kevin Durant\n\nBrewer: What Carmelo Anthony\u2019s rapid fall could mean about the future of basketball itself\n\nThe latest blow to Markelle Fultz\u2019s psyche may be the 76ers' Jimmy Butler trade\n\n\u2018What happened, happened\u2019: Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant addresses his heated exchange with Draymond Green\n\nNBA true or false: Will Jimmy Butler sink the 76ers, too?\n\nHave the Wizards turned a corner?

Kelly granted CNN\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order that will prevent the administration from keeping Acosta off the White House grounds.\n\nThe White House revoked the reporter\u2019s press pass last week after a heated exchange between him and Trump and a brief altercation with a press aide at a news conference. Acosta, CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent, is the first reporter with a \u201chard pass\u201d granting White House access to be banned.\n\nCNN sued Trump and other White House officials Tuesday over the revocation. Kelly\u2019s ruling was the result of the first legal skirmish in that lawsuit. It has the immediate effect of sending Acosta back to the White House, pending further arguments and a possible trial. The litigation is in its early stages, and a trial could be months away.\n\nHours after the judge\u2019s decision, Acosta resumed his post at the White House.\n\nKelly, whom Trump appointed to the federal bench last year, handed down his ruling two days after the network and government lawyers argued over whether the president had the power to revoke a reporter\u2019s access.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump and CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta square off at a Nov. 7 news conference. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn explaining his decision, Kelly said he agreed with the government\u2019s argument that there was no First Amendment right to come onto the White House grounds. But, he said, once the White House opened up the grounds to reporters, the First Amendment applied.\n\nKellly\u2019s ruling, however, primarily emphasized evidence indicating that the White House\u2019s decision to boot Acosta had violated the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees due process in government actions. He said the White House\u2019s decision-making was \u201cso shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me . . . who made the decision.\u201d The White House\u2019s later written arguments for banning Acosta were belated and were not sufficient to satisfy due process, Kelly said.\n\n\u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cOur sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\u201d\n\nAcosta added: \u201cI just want to thank all my colleagues in the press who supported me this week. I want to thank the judge [for this ruling]. And let\u2019s go back to work.\u201d\n\nIn comments made in the Oval Office afterward, Trump said the White House would write rules to satisfy the court\u2019s due-process concerns. He also suggested his administration would keep up the legal fight with CNN. \u201cWe will end up back in court, and we will win,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe want total freedom of the press,\u201d Trump said. \u201c. . . But you have to act with respect when you\u2019re at the White House, and when I see the way some of my people get treated at news conferences, it\u2019s terrible. So we\u2019re setting up a certain standard, which is what the court is requesting.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe always have the option of leaving, . . . and the other media and press in the room won\u2019t be happy.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement after the ruling that \u201cthe court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House,\u201d although the judge actually said reporters have such rights once admitted.\n\nSanders announced Acosta\u2019s \u201cindefinite\u201d suspension last week after the confrontation at the news conference. Trump and Sanders have had several run-ins with Acosta, stretching back to before Trump became president.\n\nAcosta watched Friday\u2019s proceedings from the courtroom in Washington, joined by a team of attorneys who included Theodore B. Olson, a former solicitor general in George W. Bush\u2019s administration, and Theodore Boutrous, a star litigator and media-law specialist.\n\nCNN had argued that the ban on Acosta violated his First Amendment rights because it amounted to \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d \u2014 that is, the president was punishing the reporter for statements and coverage he did not like. The network has also said the action violated Acosta\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights because his exclusion followed no written guidelines or rules and had no appeal or review procedures.\n\nCNN had requested \u201cemergency\u201d relief from the judge, arguing that Acosta\u2019s rights were being violated with each passing hour.\n\nUntil the White House\u2019s action last week, no reporter credentialed to cover the president had ever had a press pass revoked.\n\nA government attorney, James Burnham, argued in a hearing before Kelly on Wednesday that the president was within his rights to ban any reporter from the White House at any time, just as he excludes reporters from interviews in the Oval Office. He said Acosta could report on the president \u201cjust as effectively\u201d by watching the president on TV or by calling people within the White House. Burnham also said CNN would not be injured by Acosta\u2019s exclusion, since CNN has dozens of other journalists credentialed for the White House.\n\nBurnham said Trump\u2019s rationale for Acosta\u2019s ban was his \u201crudeness\u201d at last week\u2019s news conference, in effect arguing that Acosta\u2019s conduct, not his right to free speech, was the relevant issue.\n\nThe assertions drew a rebuttal from Boutrous, CNN\u2019s attorney, who described the ban on the reporter as arbitrary, capricious and unprecedented. He said that White House reporters need access to the premises to meet with officials and to report on un\u00adtelevised \u201cgaggles,\u201d impromptu discussions with press aides and other officials, and that banning reporters from the grounds harms their ability to do their jobs.\n\nMedia organizations have been alarmed by the White House\u2019s treatment of Acosta, saying that revoking his \u201chard pass\u201d to enter the White House is a threat to other journalists who might be similarly banned. Trump has suggested other reporters could face a similar fate if they displease him in some unspecified way. Thirteen news organizations, including The Washington Post and Fox News, jointly filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting CNN\u2019s position.\n\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, which represents journalists in their negotiations over access to the president, filed a brief Thursday that urged the court \u201cto roundly reject the president\u2019s dangerous legal position.\u201d It disputed the government\u2019s claim that the president has \u201cabsolute, unbridled discretion to decide who can report from inside the White House.\u201d\n\nDuring the presidential campaign in 2015 and 2016, Trump banned more than a dozen news organizations from his rallies and public events, including The Post. He said he would not do something similar as president. Last week, he went back on that statement.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign has used the CNN lawsuit to drum up contributions, portraying the suit as evidence of \u201cliberal bias\u201d \u2014 an assertion Boutrous brought up Wednesday in asserting that Trump had political reasons for banning Acosta.\n\n\u201cCNN is SUING President Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Secret Service agent, and other White House officials,\u201d the fundraising email says. \u201c . . .

And she has spent her entire premiership trying to deliver on the voters\u2019 decision.\n\nBefore the referendum, May had backed remaining in the bloc, but she has become one of the staunchest advocates of Brexit. \u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d became her mantra \u2014 a meaningless one, according to her detractors.\n\nFor a time, May was able to unite the warring factions of her party. But her authority was severely dented when she gambled in April 2017 by calling a snap election in hopes of strengthening her hand in divorce negotiations with the EU \u2014 only to lose her majority in Parliament.\n\nMay kept her government going by cobbling together a deal with the small Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland. It is now threatening to withdraw its support because of opposition to her Brexit deal.\n\nMuch of May\u2019s Conservative Party also hates the agreement, struck after a year and a half of tough negotiations between Britain and the EU.\n\nThe pro-Brexit wing of the party says it gives too much away and will leave Britain bound to EU rules after it leaves. Pro-EU Conservatives criticize May for ruling out a softer Brexit in which Britain remains in the EU\u2019s single market and customs union.\n\nMay vowed this week that she would \u201csee this through\u201d and secure Parliament\u2019s backing for her deal.\n\nFew doubt her fortitude and commitment to an idea of public service instilled in her upbringing as the daughter of an Anglican vicar.\n\nMay was first elected to Parliament in 1997, and soon established a reputation for unflashy competence and a knack for vanquishing her rivals.\n\nShe served for six years in the notoriously thankless job of home secretary, responsible for borders, immigration and law and order. In 2016 she beat flashier and better-known politicians, including flamboyant Brexit-backer Boris Johnson, to the post of prime minister.\n\nBut stubbornness alone may not be enough.\n\nAs Britain\u2019s second female prime minister, May is inevitably compared to the first, Margaret Thatcher, whose steely determination May admires.\n\nIn November 1990, Thatcher faced a leadership challenge from Conservative rivals. She won the ballot, but not by enough to avoid a second-round vote.\n\n\u201cI shall fight on,\u201d Thatcher said defiantly. \u201cI fight to win.\u201d\n\nWithin a week, she had been replaced.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Emily Wagster Pettus/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThirty years ago, Michael Kinsley wrote that \u201cA gaffe is when a politician tells the truth \u2014 some obvious truth he isn\u2019t supposed to say.\u201d What came to be known as a \u201cKinsley gaffe\u201d isn\u2019t merely the unintentional statement of a truth, but a truth that everyone knows but politicians aren\u2019t supposed to be foolish enough to say out loud.\n\nWhich is what happened on Thursday to Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.). If you\u2019ve heard of her at all (she was appointed to fill the seat in April after Sen. Thad Cochran resigned), it\u2019s probably because this week she got into trouble for making a joke about attending a public hanging. In Mississippi \u2014 where according to the NAACP, 581 people were lynched between 1882 and 1968 \u2014 that doesn\u2019t go over too well, especially when your opponent in the runoff election is African American. But now Hyde-Smith is in trouble again for saying out loud what we all know:\n\nSen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) is facing backlash for her remarks once again after saying laws that \u201cmake it just a little more difficult\u201d for some college students to vote are \u201ca great idea.\u201d A video tweeted Thursday afternoon shows Hyde-Smith telling a small crowd in Starkville, Miss., that \u201cthey remind me that there\u2019s a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who maybe we don\u2019t want to vote. Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d Her campaign said Thursday that the senator was joking and that the video was \u201cselectively edited.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure she was making a joke, of the \u201cHa ha, isn\u2019t it funny that this is what we do but we actually get away with pretending it\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing!\u201d variety.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a Republican has admitted that his or her voter suppression efforts are indeed about voter suppression; back in 2012, a state senator in Pennsylvania famously bragged that the voter-ID requirement Republicans passed \u201cis gonna allow Governor [Mitt] Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania\u201d in the 2012 presidential election. What\u2019s really remarkable is that they don\u2019t say it more often, that they manage to keep up the act so much of the time.\n\nIt\u2019s a tribute to their commitment to propaganda that Republicans can say with a straight face that their various suppression efforts \u2014 voter-ID laws, voter purges, closing polling places in minority neighborhoods, cutting down on early voting hours \u2014 have no purpose other than stopping phantom \u201cvoter fraud\u201d and ensuring the efficient administration of elections. But they have good reason to keep up the act.\n\nAfter all, voter suppression is working great for them. Yes, they just had historic losses in the midterm elections, but it would have been much worse had Republicans not made sure every American doesn\u2019t have equal access to the ballot box.\n\nLook at Brian Kemp in Georgia. After spending years implementing an ambitious voter suppression agenda seemingly targeted at minority voters, he appears to have won the Georgia governor\u2019s race by a hair. He currently leads Democrat Stacey Abrams by around 59,000 votes out of almost 4 million cast. Had he not been so aggressive in making it difficult for the wrong people to vote, would he be winning?\n\nOr take Florida, which has a long history of Republican voter suppression efforts targeted at African Americans. Do you think it was enough to make a difference in a Senate race that their candidate now leads by 0.2 percentage points and a governor\u2019s race their candidate leads by 0.4 percentage points?\n\nWhen you add those kinds of efforts to aggressive gerrymandering, you get a powerful combination that enables Republicans to win even when they don\u2019t have the support of the majority of voters. Ohio provides a great example. This year the Supreme Court upheld the voter purge system Republicans in the state used to toss thousands of legitimate voters off the rolls, which research has shown has a disproportionate effect on Democratic voters. And even when Democrats can overcome that and get to the polls in sufficient numbers, it isn\u2019t enough. This year Ohio voters split their votes in statehouse races almost evenly between the parties (Republicans had a one-point advantage), yet Republicans wound up with 63 percent of the seats. In Congress, Republicans kept control of 12 of the state\u2019s 16 House seats.\n\nIn Wisconsin, it was even worse: Republicans won only 46 percent of the vote in state house races, but because of the extraordinary gerrymandering they engineered after taking control of the state\u2019s government in 2010, they held on to 63 percent of the seats.\n\nThe lesson for Republicans is clear: Voter suppression works. And they\u2019re almost certainly looking around at all the close races Democrats won this year and thinking, if only we could have made it \u201cjust a little more difficult\u201d to vote, as Hyde-Smith says, things might have turned out differently. Which is why, wherever they have the power to do so, they\u2019re going to redouble their efforts to put hurdles in front of the ballot box, particularly for minority voters. And they have a Supreme Court majority that will sign off on all of it."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Riley Ray Griffin, Bloomberg", "title": "Flu shot gets a boost from dispensing with 1940s technology - SFGate", "description": "Crafting better flu shots comes down to dispensing with 1940s technology, according to CSL Ltd., which says its new method of vaccine production may offer better protection against the virus that killed almost 200 American children last season.\nFlucelvax, an \u2026", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/william-goldman-oscar-wining-screenwriter-of-butch-cassidy-and-all-the-presidents-men-dies-at-87/2018/11/16/db9afb16-e917-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/76/77/50/16513571/3/rawImage.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:03:00Z", "content": "A nurse administers a flu shot at Perry Memorial Hospital in Princeton, Illinois, on Oct. 12, 2017.

He died Nov. 16 at 87 at his home in Manhattan of complications from colon cancer and pneumonia, his daughter Jenny Goldman said.\n\nIn a career spanning more than five decades, Mr. Goldman regarded himself as a novelist who just happened to write motion pictures. \u201cIn terms of authority,\u201d he wrote in \u201cAdventures in the Screen Trade,\u201d his 1983 memoir and acid critique of show business, \u201cscreenwriters rank somewhere between the man who guards the studio gate and the man who runs the studio (this week).\u201d\n\nBut his film legacy vastly overshadowed his best-selling and genre-crossing books.

Mr. Goldman became one of the first authors to change that tradition when \u201cButch Cassidy\u201d fetched what even he considered an outlandish $400,000 in a studio bidding war.

It was the most vicious stuff, and, when the movie opened, the reviews were pissy.\u201d\n\nThe tale of inept bank robbers was a virtuosic takedown of the mythology surrounding the American West. Newman played the fast-talking outlaw Butch; Robert Redford, then a relative unknown, was cast as his sardonic partner in crime, the Sundance Kid.\n\n[Academy Award-winning actor Paul Newman dies at 83]\n\nTheir tough-guy attitudes are played for laughs in a memorable cliff dive into a raging river. They need to make the leap to evade a posse, but Sundance confesses he can\u2019t swim. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Butch chortles. \u201cThe fall will probably kill ya.\u201d\n\nCritics were slow to embrace the film \u2014 Pauline Kael\u2019s review in the New Yorker ran with the headline \u201cThe Bottom of the Pit\u201d \u2014 but audiences responded to its comically absurdist, anti-establishment tone. An interlude featuring Butch and a female companion riding a bicycle to the tune of \u201cRaindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head\u201d became one of the most memorable sequences in 1960s cinema. The film cost $6.5 million to produce and generated more than $40 million, and it made Redford a breakout sensation.\n\nMr. Goldman collaborated with Redford on several more films, most notably but most unhappily \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d based on the book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein about the Watergate break-in and coverup that led to President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s resignation.\n\nRedford had purchased the rights to the book and hired Mr. Goldman to write the movie version. \u201cIt seemed, at best, a dubious project,\u201d Mr. Goldman wrote in \u201cAdventures in the Screen Trade.\u201d \u201cPolitics were anathema at the box office, the material was talky, there was no action.\u201d\n\nMr. Goldman looked upon the Watergate saga, with its inept conspirators, as something of a \u201ccomic opera.\u201d He opened with the break-in by Nixon operatives at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, presenting the burglars as bumblers with the wrong set of keys.\n\nRedford, who like the reporters regarded the affair as a grievous subversion of democracy, reportedly objected to the shaggy-dog approach, reminiscent of \u201cButch Cassidy.\u201d\n\nMany hands began operating on the script \u2014 a source of discontent for Mr. Goldman. He took credit for the movie\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox finale, which showed Woodward and Bernstein making an embarrassing mistake. Mr. Goldman believed that audiences, who would watch the film for the first time two years after Nixon resigned, would understand that the reporters, dogged but human, had been vindicated.\n\nMr. Goldman\u2019s screenwriting career later soared under director Rob Reiner with \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d \u2014 a fractured fairy tale that winks at cliches of romance and swashbuckling adventure \u2014 and then \u201cMisery\u201d (1990), based on Stephen King\u2019s novel about a popular writer held hostage and brutalized by a sociopathic fan. (Mr. Goldman helped write the 2015 Broadway play version starring Bruce Willis and Laurie Metcalf.)\n\nAmong other films, Mr. Goldman worked on the tongue-in-cheek western \u201cMaverick\u201d (1994); and \u201cAbsolute Power\u201d (1997), adapted from David Baldacci\u2019s best-selling suspense novel; and two further King adaptations, \u201cHearts in Atlantis\u201d (2001) and \u201cDreamcatcher\u201d (2003). For years, Mr. Goldman was one of the best-paid script doctors in Hollywood, reportedly making $1 million for four weeks\u2019 work.\n\nMr. Goldman, who learned his trade from a screenwriting guidebook he bought in 1964 at an all-night bookstore in Times Square, abhorred film schools and auteur theory. In profanity-laced interviews, he repeated his mantras: \u201cScreenplays are structure,\u201d \u201cstories are everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like writing a book,\u201d he said to the publication Creative Screenwriting in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a play. You\u2019re writing for camera and audiences. One of the things which I tell young people is, when you\u2019re starting up, go to see a movie all day long.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the time the 8:00 show comes,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou\u2019ll hate the movie so much you won\u2019t pay much attention to it. But you\u2019ll pay attention to the audience. The great thing about audiences is, I believe they react exactly the same around the world at the same places in movies. They laugh, and they scream, and they\u2019re bored. And when they\u2019re bored it\u2019s the writer\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\n'Nobody knows anything'\n\nWilliam Weil Goldman was born in Chicago on Aug. 12, 1931, and grew up in the suburb of Highland Park. His upbringing was tense, with a mother he described as hectoring and an alcoholic businessman father who committed suicide by overdosing on pills when Mr. Goldman was 15.\n\nMovies and the novels of Irwin Shaw were his escape. He entered Oberlin College in Ohio aspiring to write short stories but had ludicrously bad luck getting any published, even while serving as an editor of a campus literary magazine.\n\n\u201cI would anonymously submit my short stories,\u201d he told the London Guardian. \u201cWhen the other editors \u2014 two brilliant girls \u2014 would read them, they would say, \u2018We can\u2019t possibly publish this [rubbish].\u2019 And I would agree.\u201d\n\nHe graduated in 1952, spent two years in the Army, then received a master\u2019s degree in English from Columbia University in 1956. While working toward a doctorate, he wrote his first novel in a three-week catharsis of pent-up fear that he would wind up as a high school English teacher in Duluth, Minn. \u2014 the only job offer he had waiting.\n\nThe resulting book, \u201cThe Temple of Gold\u201d (1957), a coming-of-age story, impressed a prestigious publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. Other books followed at a furious clip, among them \u201cBoys and Girls Together,\u201d a 1964 bestseller about a group of struggling young adults in New York, and his Boston Strangler-like thriller \u201cNo Way to Treat a Lady,\u201d published the same year and turned into a film in 1968 starring Rod Steiger as a psychopathic killer with a penchant for disguise.\n\nMr. Goldman adapted for film several novels, including Ira Levin\u2019s suburban horror story \u201cThe Stepford Wives\u201d (1975) and Cornelius Ryan\u2019s World War II book \u201cA Bridge Too Far\u201d (1977). His screenplay for his 1974 novel \u201cMarathon Man,\u201d about a graduate student who stumbles on a nest of modern-day Nazis, became a hit 1976 film with Laurence Olivier as a dentist who drills into teeth as a method of torture. He also wrote the original script of \u201cThe Great Waldo Pepper\u201d (1975), with Redford as a barnstorming pilot.\n\nMr. Goldman\u2019s later books included the Hollywood casting-couch story \u201cTinsel\u201d (1979), the Cold War science-fiction thriller \u201cControl\u201d (1982), and \u201cHype and Glory\u201d (1990), a droll reflection on his service as a judge at the Cannes Film Festival and the Miss America Pageant.\n\nHis 30-year marriage to photographer Ilene Jones ended in divorce in 1991. In addition to his daughter, of Philadelphia, survivors include his domestic partner of 19 years, Susan Burden of Manhattan; and a grandson.\n\nAnother daughter from his marriage, Susanna Goldman, died in 2015. His brother, James Goldman, who won an Oscar for his screen adaptation of his play \u201cThe Lion in Winter\u201d and wrote the book to Stephen Sondheim\u2019s musical \u201cFollies,\u201d died in 1998.\n\nIn \u201cAdventures in the Screen Trade,\u201d with its gossipy behind-the-scenes look at the caprice of art and commerce, Mr. Goldman coined an enduring phrase in the Hollywood lexicon: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d After decades in the business, he had come to see success and failure as a matter of chance.\n\nHe had his share of flops, such as \u201cThe Ghost and the Darkness,\u201d a 1996 thriller about the hunt for two lions who kill railway workers in Africa. It was a taut story, starring Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer, and got strong reviews but played to empty theaters.\n\n\u201cIf you can believe in the existence of evil, you can understand that story,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2009. \u201cNobody wanted the lions to be that successful. We live in a Disney world. Maybe we miscast the lions.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Islamic State group suspect arrested, charged in Germany", "description": "German prosecutors say they've charged a 32-year-old Syrian man with membership in a terrorist organization for alleged involvement with the extremist Islamic State group", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/islamic-state-group-suspect-arrested-charged-in-germany/2018/11/16/99a6f6f8-e9b0-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:02:14Z", "content": "BERLIN German prosecutors say theyve charged a 32-year-old Syrian man with membership in a terrorist organization for alleged involvement with the extremist Islamic State group.

Last year, the league said Grabowski \u201cfalsifies the history of Poland, proclaiming the thesis that Poles are complicit in the extermination of Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring World War II, due to the demoralizing circumstances and German actions, it is true that vile-acting individuals could be found among Poles and Jews alike,\u201d the group wrote in a statement signed by dozens of Polish academics. \u201cYet, we should remember that the objective of the Germans was also to \u2018eradicate the Polish nation\u2019 and \u2018completely destroy Poland.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe anti-defamation organization has been part of a broader effort under the government of the populist Law and Justice party to challenge research on Polish participation in the killing of Jews by Nazi Germany. Poland was under German occupation during World War II.\n\n\u201cWhat is important, from my point of view, is that the militant nationalists who nowadays hold sway in Poland be warned that they will be held to account, that they are wrong if they think that their outrageous statements and slanders will go unnoticed,\u201d Grabowski, who was born and attended university in Warsaw, told the AP.\n\nOfficial efforts under the Law and Justice government have included promoting the memory of the Polish gentiles who sheltered Jews during the war. Scholars who research Polish violence against Jews have faced censure and prosecution.\n\nThe issue came under international scrutiny earlier this year when Polish lawmakers voted to make it illegal to blame the nation for Holocaust crimes. The law has since been amended to remove prison as a possible punishment for violators, though individuals can still be tried and fined. The measure created a rift with Israel and was also condemned by the U.S.\n\nAlso Friday, the Polish ambassador to Germany, Andrzej Przylebski, accused Germans of frequently reducing World War II to the Holocaust \u201cas if Adolf Hitler was primarily or exclusively concerned with the murder of European Jews.\u201d\n\nAt a Berlin conference attended by the German foreign minister, Przylebski said Polish victims \u201care almost completely forgotten or downplayed,\u201d according to a report from the Wirtualna Polska news portal.\n\nGrabowski\u2019s \u201cHunt for the Jews: Betrayal and Murder in German-Occupied Poland\u201d documents the involvement of Poles in one rural area in finding and killing Jews who had escaped from ghettos and were trying to survive by hiding among gentiles. It was awarded the 2014 Yad Vashem International Book Prize for Holocaust Research.\n\nThe book also sparked heated debates, and the scholar says he received death threats after its publication. After a German newspaper reviewed the book favorably, a far-right Polish website ran an article with a photograph of the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. The headline was \u201cSieg Heil, Herr Grabowski, Three Times Sieg Heil.\u201d\n\nGrabowski successfully sued for libel.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nA surprisingly early season snowstorm glazed our region with anywhere from an inch to four-plus inches of snow and sleet. We\u2019ve mapped the snow coverage and explain how this bizarre, much-too-early storm unfolded.\n\nIt\u2019s been a woefully compressed autumn: Leaves held off changing their color, then suddenly turned vivid hues. Then, just a couple weeks later, winter arrived with a multiple-choice day of snow, ice and cold rain. Oh, and by the way, it\u2019s still mid-November.\n\nAt Reagan National Airport, Washington\u2019s official observing station, 1.4 inches of snow fell, a record for the date. It was the most snow to fall in November in Washington since 3.5 inches in 1989, and the first measurable snowfall during the month since 1996. This was the first instance of an inch of snow so early in the season since Nov. 11, 1987, and among the top 10 earliest first-inch events on record.\n\nDulles International Airport, which received 3 inches, also set a daily snowfall record, as did Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport, which posted 1.7 inches.\n\nThe frozen fun began predawn, with a thump of snow across much of the region, arriving just in time for the heart of the morning commute \u2014 around 8 a.m. This was the leading edge of moist air arriving from the southeast, lifted by a gathering nor\u2019easter and frozen by a deeply entrenched wedge of freezing air along and east of the Appalachians.\n\nVolleys of sleet mixed with snow, moderately intense at times, came through the morning. By early afternoon, a surge of \u201cmilder\u201d (translation: 1 to 2 degrees above freezing) air arrived from the southeast, changing the snow to plain rain along the Interstate 95 corridor. Meanwhile, snowfall topped half a foot by afternoon\u2019s end in the high elevations far north and west of Washington.\n\nThe snow accumulation map below is based on data supplied by the National Weather Service. I\u2019ve added generalized contour lines to orient the reader to the gradient in snowfall: Less than an inch fell along the Chesapeake Bay; almost eight inches coated the Catoctins. Those of us east of the mountains would have recorded even more snow, had significant sleet not mixed in and cut down the totals.\n\n\n\nSnow accumulation based on National Weather Service reports. (Adapted by Jeffrey Halverson)\n\nThese coastal-type storms, which converge and lift vast quantities of Atlantic moisture, always get started at jet stream level. That\u2019s 30,000 feet in the atmosphere. The weather map below shows this level at 8 a.m. Friday. There\u2019s a lot going on here, but you can\u2019t mistake the giant low pressure system swirling over the eastern third of the United States.\n\n\n\nJet stream level wind flow and pressure patterns. (NOAA, adapted by Jeffrey Halverson)\n\nThat intense, upper-level vortex distorted the jet stream airflow, causing it to \u201cfan\u201d or spread apart over the Mid-Atlantic. Notice how the red flow arrows diverge (meteorologists call this difluence). This action draws up large amounts of air from below. You\u2019ll notice the zone of wintry precipitation (as mapped by radar, in a colored underlay) fits perfectly within the spreading zone of air aloft.\n\nFor snow, cold air is key. The next image (a ground-level map) shows how our region\u2019s geography can funnel and trap cold airflow from the northeast. The Appalachians are shaded green.\n\n\n\nSurface weather map, showing low and high pressure systems. (NOAA, adapted by Jeffrey Halverson)\n\nA potent wedge of high pressure, sitting over New England, extended to the south and west, locking in a cold dome of freezing air against the mountains \u2026 and splaying out across the Piedmont of Virginia and Maryland. Cold air is dense air, and it became banked up against the terrain. Only a mighty, mild wind from an opposing direction (southeast) can scour out the cold; it usually takes lots of hours for this to happen.\n\nThe map shows this surge of mild air, from the southeast, directed onshore from the warmer Atlantic, by the coastal low\u2019s windy circulation. As this low moved up the coast, the onshore flow got stronger. This map, at 8 a.m., also shows a purple dashed line, the air\u2019s freezing line at the ground. In an animation, these maps would show the purple line slowly retreating deeper inland, nudging counties immediately west and north of Washington into the 33 degrees, above-freezing zone. That transition from snow/sleet to rain was well underway during the early afternoon.\n\nWe call the wedged-in, chilled air \u201cAppalachian cold air damming,\u201d and without our humble mountain range, we\u2019d be subject to much less winter misery around here. These wedges become more frequent from December through February, as northern latitudes become more deeply chilled. It\u2019s not uncommon to get wedges in mid-November, though, but a wedge this intense, so early, is quite rare.\n\nThese chilly wedges are fairly shallow, just a few thousand feet deep. This one extended to nearly twice that altitude, more than a mile up, well into the critical cloud layer where snow gets its start. Frankly, its depth, intensity and staying power surprised many meteorologists. This wedge was full-on, winter-strength, i.e., typical of late January or February, not mid-November.\n\nWhy was it so strong? At least three factors played a role. First, there was optimal positioning of the parent high-pressure cell over New England, setting up the perfect channel of northeasterly, cold flow \u2014 aligned exactly parallel to the eastern slopes of the Appalachians.\n\nSecond, very dry air at the onset of precipitation caused an efficient refrigeration effect: Trillions of water and ice particles evaporating (sublimating) into the dry air layer sapped the air\u2019s heat content. The very intense precipitation rates during predawn ensured that the air layer extending from ground level to about 7,000 feet cooled several degrees in a few hours.\n\nThird, recall the second image above, which showed the fan of rising air. Air cools as it rises and expands. The more vigorous this process, it\u2019s possible for entire air layers to rise in the lower atmosphere. This \u201cdynamic cooling\u201d probably contributed to further chilling of the air mass overlying the Appalachians.\n\nAll of these complex variables made this a very challenging forecast for meteorologists. Capital Weather Gang will post a review of the forecast on Friday afternoon.\n\nCapital Weather Gang\u2019s Jason Samenow contributed to this story."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Jennie-O recalling ground turkey in salmonella outbreak - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Jennie-O recalling ground turkey in salmonella outbreak Washington Post NEW YORK \u2014 Jennie-O-Turkey is recalling more than 91,000 pounds of raw turkey in an ongoing salmonella outbreak.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nThis month\u2019s House elections weren\u2019t surprising in the sense that the broad gains enjoyed by the Democratic Party were predicted in advance. They were surprising, though, in the context of the 2016 election, an election that seemed to many to rewrite the rules about both those sorts of predictions and which voters would turn out to vote. In late 2016, the idea that Democrats would regain control of the House by a decent margin seemed a little less likely.\n\nBut they did. With a handful of House contests still unresolved, the distribution of the incoming Congress looks something like this, with Democrats mostly holding seats in districts won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Republicans mostly holding seats in districts won by President Trump.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nOut there at the edge for the Democrats is Minnesota\u2019s 7th District, in which Rep. Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.) again defied the odds and, again, won reelection despite the district having voted Republican in presidential races for at least two decades.\n\nIn the new Senate, the picture is generally the same, though there are a few more Democrats representing now deeper-red Trump states. Two of those Democrats, of course, are Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who both won reelection last week.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Republicans picked up seats in three more-red states during the midterms, plus they\u2019ll likely gain a seat in Florida. The Democrats picked up a seat in the slightly red state of Arizona.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe net effect was subtle. The Republicans' gain of deep-red seats held by Democrats makes the places represented by the GOP caucus in the Senate slightly redder on average and the Democrats' body slightly bluer. On average, the current Republican caucus represents states that favored Trump by 18 points and the Democratic caucus represents states that favored Clinton by eight. Now, the Republican average is 19 and the Democratic average is 10.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nMovement to the poles\n\nIn the House the picture is different. There, every seat was on the ballot, so the shifts were zero sum. The Democrats picked up a ton of Republican-held seats in districts won by Clinton in 2016; the Republicans picked up only a couple of seats (including two in Minnesota).\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe net shift? The Republican caucus in the current House (attributing vacant seats to the party of their most recent occupant) represents areas that voted for Trump by 21 points on average. The current Democratic caucus represents areas that voted for Clinton by 33.\n\nThe incoming Congress moves the Republicans to the right by four points, to an average of a 25-point Trump advantage. The Democratic caucus, picking up so many districts where the results in the presidential contest were closer, moves five points, to an average advantage for Clinton of 28 points.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nIn theory, then, the effect will be a more moderate Democratic caucus \u2014 and a more conservative Republican one.\n\nEarlier this year, I spoke with a number of Republicans who\u2019d publicly expressed frustration with Trump\u2019s leadership, and asked them what the party would look like once Trump was out of office. Evan McMullin, who ran as an independent in 2016, predicted this shift.\n\n\u201cElectorally in 2018, I expect it\u2019s not going to go well in the House,\u201d McMullin told me. \u201cI expect we\u2019re going to end up with a party that is more committed to Trump than it is now. Many moderates are already saying they\u2019re not going to run again. Others will be defeated.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019ll be a smaller contingent in the House, but it\u2019ll be more Trumpian,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that will accelerate the party\u2019s movement towards a shrunken, smaller, less influential space, more electoral defeats, which will hopefully lead to reform.\u201d\n\nThe first part of McMullin\u2019s prediction has proved to be accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Vanessa Williams", "title": "Abrams mulling asking a court to order a second vote in Georgia governor\u2019s race", "description": "The long-shot strategy comes as election officials appear close to certifying a Kemp win.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/abrams-mulling-asking-a-court-to-order-a-second-vote-in-georgia-governors-race/2018/11/16/b45a27f8-e9a2-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6A5D9HFBTTLQ0QqcDOQd8P61o-k=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JGGMTQHJUMI6RO63OL637HKP5U.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:37:13Z", "content": "Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is considering asking a court to intervene in her race against Republican Brian Kemp and order an extraordinary second round of voting in response to charges of election irregularities.

(Photos by John Amis/AP)\n\nEarlier Friday, Abrams, the former Democratic leader of the Georgia House, was considering filing a separate lawsuit contesting the results and demanding a new election. That would have been based on a provision in Georgia law that allows losing candidates to challenge results.\n\nBut she said Friday evening that she did not want to gain an office if she had to \u201cscheme\u201d to get it, and that she had determined that current law gave her \u201cno further viable remedy.\u201d\n\n[Tensions high between Kemp and Abrams teams as Georgia awaits final vote count in governor\u2019s race]\n\n\u201cI acknowledge that former secretary of state Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cBut to watch an elected official who claims to represent the people in this state baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people\u2019s democratic right to vote has been truly appalling.\u201d\n\nShe also said she would pray for Kemp\u2019s success and that she asked that he \u201cpledge to fight for the rights of those who disagree with him.\u201d\n\nKemp, in a statement issued by spokesman Ryan Mahoney, praised Abrams\u2019s \u201cpassion, hard work, and commitment to public service.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe election is over and hard-working Georgians are ready to move forward. We can no longer dwell on the divisive politics of the past but must focus on Georgia\u2019s bright and promising future,\u201d said Kemp, whose campaign had harshly denounced immigrants and others as he modeled it on President Trump\u2019s 2016 success.\n\nAbrams, 44, and Kemp, 55, have long clashed over voting rights. Four years ago, Abrams founded the New Georgia Project, with a goal of adding hundreds of thousands of people of color to the voting rolls. Abrams is no longer affiliated with the group that she says signed up more than 200,000 potential new voters, but most of them never made it onto the rolls.\n\nKemp accused the group of voter fraud and launched an investigation that found no wrongdoing. He has pursued restrictive voter registration and identification laws and has purged more than 1 million voters from the rolls in recent years \u2014 actions that Abrams and activists say amount to suppression.\n\nSeveral of those laws have been successfully challenged in court as violations of the federal Voting Rights Act, including rulings that have come down before and since the Nov. 6 election.\n\nSince the election, the Abrams campaign, through court filings and news conferences, had shared stories of individuals who had trouble casting ballots.\n\nVoters told of having waited up to four hours to vote, not receiving absentee ballots that they requested and getting inaccurate information from county elections officials. The lawsuits also have revealed a lack of uniformity in how counties address problems with absentee and provisional ballots. Although some counties try to contact voters to fix mistakes and omissions in their voting documents, others simply reject the ballots.\n\nKemp\u2019s victory was made possible through a come-from-\n\nbehind surge in the Republican primary earlier this year, in which he received the endorsement of Trump and aired several provocative TV ads in which he wielded guns and pledged to round up \u201ccriminal illegals\u201d in his pickup truck.\n\nAbrams became a national sensation after winning the primary, and she had received support from former presidents Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter as well as media mogul Oprah Winfrey. She made health care a major focus of her campaign, as did other Democrats around the country in this year\u2019s midterms.\n\nThe issue of race loomed large over the campaign in its final weeks, however. A racist and anti-Semitic robo-call targeting Abrams began making the rounds about a week before Election Day. The call was produced by the Road to Power, a white-\n\nsupremacist group based in Idaho. Kemp\u2019s campaign also came under criticism for an election-eve tweet attempting to tie Abrams to a radical group, the New Black Panther Party.\n\nThe razor-thin margin between Abrams and Kemp is reflective of Georgia\u2019s march from once-solid Republican terrain toward becoming a purple state. Trump won Georgia by five percentage points in 2016, but Democrats\u2019 increasing strength in the suburbs bodes well for their chances in future statewide races.\n\nJohn Wagner contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "William Goldman, Oscar-winning screenwriter of 'Butch Cassidy' and 'All the President's Men,' dies at 87 - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post William Goldman, Oscar-winning screenwriter of 'Butch Cassidy' and 'All the President's Men,' dies at 87 Washington Post Badly hung over, the detective rises from a fold-out couch in his office.

He became a phenomenal critical and commercial success in Hollywood, not least for his talent for indelible cinematic phrasemaking.\n\nFrom \u201cButch Cassidy\u201d: \u201cRules??!

Mr. Goldman became one of the first authors to change that tradition when \u201cButch Cassidy\u201d fetched what even he considered an outlandish $400,000 in a studio bidding war. It made him an instant celebrity, lionized and vilified.\n\n1 of 67 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2018: Stan Lee, John McCain, Aretha Franklin and other famous faces we lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2018.

It was the most vicious stuff, and, when the movie opened, the reviews were pissy.\u201d\n\nThe tale of inept bank robbers was a virtuosic takedown of the mythology surrounding the American West. Newman played the fast-talking outlaw Butch; Robert Redford, then a relative unknown, was cast as his sardonic partner in crime, the Sundance Kid.\n\n[Academy Award-winning actor Paul Newman dies at 83]\n\nTheir tough-guy attitudes are played for laughs in a memorable cliff dive into a raging river. They need to make the leap to evade a posse, but Sundance confesses he can\u2019t swim. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Butch chortles. \u201cThe fall will probably kill ya.\u201d\n\nCritics were slow to embrace the film \u2014 Pauline Kael\u2019s review in the New Yorker ran with the headline \u201cThe Bottom of the Pit\u201d \u2014 but audiences responded to its comically absurdist, anti-establishment tone. An interlude featuring Butch and a female companion riding a bicycle to the tune of \u201cRaindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head\u201d became one of the most memorable sequences in 1960s cinema. The film cost $6.5 million to produce and generated more than $40 million, and it made Redford a breakout sensation.\n\nMr. Goldman collaborated with Redford on several more films, most notably but most unhappily \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d based on the book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein about the Watergate break-in and coverup that led to President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s resignation.\n\nRedford had purchased the rights to the book and hired Mr. Goldman to write the movie version. \u201cIt seemed, at best, a dubious project,\u201d Mr. Goldman wrote in \u201cAdventures in the Screen Trade.\u201d \u201cPolitics were anathema at the box office, the material was talky, there was no action.\u201d\n\nMr. Goldman looked upon the Watergate saga, with its inept conspirators, as something of a \u201ccomic opera.\u201d He opened with the break-in by Nixon operatives at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, presenting the burglars as bumblers with the wrong set of keys.\n\nRedford, who like the reporters regarded the affair as a grievous subversion of democracy, reportedly objected to the shaggy-dog approach, reminiscent of \u201cButch Cassidy.\u201d\n\nMany hands began operating on the script \u2014 a source of discontent for Mr. Goldman. He took credit for the movie\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox finale, which showed Woodward and Bernstein making an embarrassing mistake. Mr. Goldman believed that audiences, who would watch the film for the first time two years after Nixon resigned, would understand that the reporters, dogged but human, had been vindicated.\n\nMr. Goldman\u2019s screenwriting career later soared under director Rob Reiner with \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d \u2014 a fractured fairy tale that winks at cliches of romance and swashbuckling adventure \u2014 and then \u201cMisery\u201d (1990), based on Stephen King\u2019s novel about a popular writer held hostage and brutalized by a sociopathic fan. (Mr. Goldman helped write the 2015 Broadway play version starring Bruce Willis and Laurie Metcalf.)\n\nAmong other films, Mr. Goldman worked on the tongue-in-cheek western \u201cMaverick\u201d (1994); and \u201cAbsolute Power\u201d (1997), adapted from David Baldacci\u2019s best-selling suspense novel; and two further King adaptations, \u201cHearts in Atlantis\u201d (2001) and \u201cDreamcatcher\u201d (2003). For years, Mr. Goldman was one of the best-paid script doctors in Hollywood, reportedly making $1 million for four weeks\u2019 work.\n\nMr. Goldman, who learned his trade from a screenwriting guidebook he bought in 1964 at an all-night bookstore in Times Square, abhorred film schools and auteur theory. In profanity-laced interviews, he repeated his mantras: \u201cScreenplays are structure,\u201d \u201cstories are everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like writing a book,\u201d he said to the publication Creative Screenwriting in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a play. You\u2019re writing for camera and audiences. One of the things which I tell young people is, when you\u2019re starting up, go to see a movie all day long.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the time the 8:00 show comes,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou\u2019ll hate the movie so much you won\u2019t pay much attention to it. But you\u2019ll pay attention to the audience. The great thing about audiences is, I believe they react exactly the same around the world at the same places in movies. They laugh, and they scream, and they\u2019re bored. And when they\u2019re bored it\u2019s the writer\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\n'Nobody knows anything'\n\nWilliam Weil Goldman was born in Chicago on Aug. 12, 1931, and grew up in the suburb of Highland Park. His upbringing was tense, with a mother he described as hectoring and an alcoholic businessman father who committed suicide by overdosing on pills when Mr. Goldman was 15.\n\nMovies and the novels of Irwin Shaw were his escape. He entered Oberlin College in Ohio aspiring to write short stories but had ludicrously bad luck getting any published, even while serving as an editor of a campus literary magazine.\n\n\u201cI would anonymously submit my short stories,\u201d he told the London Guardian. \u201cWhen the other editors \u2014 two brilliant girls \u2014 would read them, they would say, \u2018We can\u2019t possibly publish this [rubbish].\u2019 And I would agree.\u201d\n\nHe graduated in 1952, spent two years in the Army, then received a master\u2019s degree in English from Columbia University in 1956. While working toward a doctorate, he wrote his first novel in a three-week catharsis of pent-up fear that he would wind up as a high school English teacher in Duluth, Minn. \u2014 the only job offer he had waiting.\n\nThe resulting book, \u201cThe Temple of Gold\u201d (1957), a coming-of-age story, impressed a prestigious publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. Other books followed at a furious clip, among them \u201cBoys and Girls Together,\u201d a 1964 bestseller about a group of struggling young adults in New York, and his Boston Strangler-like thriller \u201cNo Way to Treat a Lady,\u201d published the same year and turned into a film in 1968 starring Rod Steiger as a psychopathic killer with a penchant for disguise.\n\nMr. Goldman adapted for film several novels, including Ira Levin\u2019s suburban horror story \u201cThe Stepford Wives\u201d (1975) and Cornelius Ryan\u2019s World War II book \u201cA Bridge Too Far\u201d (1977). His screenplay for his 1974 novel \u201cMarathon Man,\u201d about a graduate student who stumbles on a nest of modern-day Nazis, became a hit 1976 film with Laurence Olivier as a dentist who drills into teeth as a method of torture. He also wrote the original script of \u201cThe Great Waldo Pepper\u201d (1975), with Redford as a barnstorming pilot.\n\nMr. Goldman\u2019s later books included the Hollywood casting-couch story \u201cTinsel\u201d (1979), the Cold War science-fiction thriller \u201cControl\u201d (1982), and \u201cHype and Glory\u201d (1990), a droll reflection on his service as a judge at the Cannes Film Festival and the Miss America Pageant.\n\nHis 30-year marriage to photographer Ilene Jones ended in divorce in 1991. In addition to his daughter, of Philadelphia, survivors include his domestic partner of 19 years, Susan Burden of Manhattan; and a grandson.\n\nAnother daughter from his marriage, Susanna Goldman, died in 2015. His brother, James Goldman, who won an Oscar for his screen adaptation of his play \u201cThe Lion in Winter\u201d and wrote the book to Stephen Sondheim\u2019s musical \u201cFollies,\u201d died in 1998.\n\nIn \u201cAdventures in the Screen Trade,\u201d with its gossipy behind-the-scenes look at the caprice of art and commerce, Mr. Goldman coined an enduring phrase in the Hollywood lexicon: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d After decades in the business, he had come to see success and failure as a matter of chance.\n\nHe had his share of flops, such as \u201cThe Ghost and the Darkness,\u201d a 1996 thriller about the hunt for two lions who kill railway workers in Africa. It was a taut story, starring Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer, and got strong reviews but played to empty theaters.\n\n\u201cIf you can believe in the existence of evil, you can understand that story,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2009. \u201cNobody wanted the lions to be that successful. We live in a Disney world. Maybe we miscast the lions.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "German chancellor visits scene of far-right protest", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel visits Chemnitz to meet residents, three months after the eastern city was the scene of violent, far-right protests that highlighted the country's divisions on the issue of migration", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/german-chancellor-visits-scene-of-far-right-protest/2018/11/16/b140ce3c-e9ac-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:34:16Z", "content": "CHEMNITZ, Germany Angela Merkel traveled to Chemnitz Friday to meet with residents, three months after the eastern city was the scene of violent, far-right protests that highlighted divisions in Germany and the chancellors own party on the issue of migration.\u2026 [+2279 chars]", "fulltext": "CHEMNITZ, Germany \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel visited a city that was shaken by violent, far-right protests three months ago and appealed Friday to Germans not to cross a line when venting anger about issues such as immigration.\n\nDuring a two-hour event with readers of the local Freie Press newspaper, Merkel was asked repeatedly about the unrest that put Chemnitz in the headlines . Protesters held an anti-Merkel demonstration nearby.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are worried that perhaps there are too many refugees here,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are (also) people who have open prejudices against people who simply look different. You have to draw a line between these (two).\u201d\n\nThe protests were triggered by the killing in August of a German man that authorities blamed on recent migrants . Far-right groups flocked to Chemnitz, located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of Berlin, their members mingling with residents expressing their anguish over the slaying.\n\nSome in Germany \u2014 including members of Merkel\u2019s Union bloc \u2014 voiced understanding for the protesters and said they shouldn\u2019t be condemned for the violent actions of a small neo-Nazi minority.\n\nMerkel made clear she thought otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe line needs to be drawn. You can\u2019t show understanding for everything,\u201d she said, drawing a parallel with her experience growing up in East Germany at a time when the communist regime\u2019s secret security police had a vast number of informants.\n\n\u201cI decided for myself, you don\u2019t have to go to the Stasi to have a career, however bad the system is,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cAnd you also don\u2019t need to persecute people because you\u2019ve got a political gripe.\u201d\n\nLast month, authorities arrested seven people on suspicion of forming a far-right terrorist organization calling itself \u201cRevolution Chemnitz\u201d and plotting attacks.\n\nAnalysts noted that Merkel\u2019s trip to Chemnitz followed her decision not to seek a fifth term in 2021, freeing the longtime leader to concentrate on her legacy.\n\n\u201cThis (visit) to me is a sign of somebody who cares and perhaps wants to rectify impressions that might have been made in 2015 because of her decision to allow migrants to come to Germany,\u201d said Sudha David-Wilp, deputy director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank.\n\nMost Germans initially welcomed Merkel\u2019s decision not to close their country\u2019s borders to refugees fleeing violence in Syria and elsewhere three years ago. The strain on resources and a number of violent crimes allegedly committed by migrants stoked doubts about Germany\u2019s ability to cope with the influx.\n\nOpinion polls have reflected the shift. Merkel\u2019s center-right bloc has lost support, while gains have been made by the nationalist Alternative for Germany party.\n\nSenior Alternative for Germany leaders marched alongside known far-right extremists during one of the Chemnitz protests. The nationalists hope to win next year\u2019s state election in Saxony, where Chemnitz is located and which is currently governed by Merkel\u2019s party.\n\nChemnitz Mayor Barbara Ludwig, who was thrust onto the front line of a debate on handling anti-migrant sentiment following the summer violence, said Friday that \u201cwe\u2019re experiencing a polarization at all levels of society.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Chemnitz even threatened to tear apart the federal government,\u201d said Ludwig.\n\nThat threat appears to have ebbed, for now, with Merkel\u2019s party poised to choose a new party chair next month to lead it into the 2021 national election.\n\nMeanwhile, Merkel\u2019s own approval ratings appear to have been boosted by her announcement that she won\u2019t run again.\n\nIn a poll published Thursday by public broadcaster ARD, 56 percent of respondents said they wanted Merkel to govern for a full term, compared with 49 percent in January.\n\nThe phone survey of 1,006 respondents took place on Nov. 12 and 13, and had a margin of error of up to 3.1 percentage points.\n\n_____\n\nJordans reported from Berlin.

The proposed regulation replaces \u2026 [+6490 chars]", "fulltext": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday released her long-awaited rewrite of rules governing campus sexual harassment and assault allegations, narrowing the cases schools must investigate and giving the accused more rights.\n\nThe proposal came under immediate fire from women\u2019s rights groups and Democrats, who said the rules would allow assailants and schools to escape responsibility for harassment and assault and would make college campuses less safe for women.\n\nBut others said the proposal restores balance in a system that had been skewed too far in favor of the accusers.\n\nDeVos said she had worked to strike a balance while creating a more transparent and reliable process.\n\n\u201cWe can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder the proposal, fewer allegations would be considered sexual harassment and schools would be responsible only for investigating incidents that are part of campus programs and activities and that were properly reported. Schools could choose a higher legal standard for considering evidence.\n\nThe rules come after years of rising pressure on universities to better respond to allegations of sexual assault and other misconduct. They land at a time when the #MeToo movement brought increased public scrutiny and accountability to harassment and assault. This proposal, by contrast, pushes the pendulum in the reverse direction.\n\n\u201cI am dismayed with the Trump administration\u2019s cruel proposal that will have the effect of putting power in the hands of abusers & dissuading survivors from coming forward,\u201d John B. King Jr., who served as education secretary in the Obama administration, said on Twitter.\n\nThe most divisive aspect of the proposal may be allowing attorneys for the accused to cross-\n\nexamine accusers.\n\nThe proposed rule goes too far in incorporating legal concepts into a school disciplinary setting, argued Terry Hartle, a senior vice president at the American Council on Education, which represents university presidents.\n\n\u201cThis would permit one student to hire a highly paid legal pit bull to grill another student in a campus disciplinary hearing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not courts. I\u2019m not sure we should try to act like courts.\u201d\n\nBut advocates for the accused called this an essential change that could help counter inherent bias among college administrators who investigate incidents.\n\n\u201cCross-examination is the most effective method to get to the truth,\u201d said Kimberly C. Lau, who leads the college discipline practice at the law firm Warshaw Burstein.\n\nThe regulations stem from a 1972 law known as Title IX that bars sex discrimination at schools that receive federal funding. Most of the attention is on higher education, but the rules also apply to elementary and secondary schools.\n\nUnlike less formal Obama-era guidance that is being replaced, the new plan is a proposed regulation that will be subject to public comment and, once finalized, carry the force of law.\n\nCritics said the Obama approach was confusing for universities and improperly made outside the formal rulemaking process.\n\nUsing guidelines \u201callowed the Obama Department of Education to essentially make up rules that had no basis in any relevant statute or Supreme Court opinion,\u201d said David Bernstein, executive director of the Liberty & Law Center at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.\n\nOverall, the proposed regulation describes what constitutes sexual harassment or assault for the purpose of Title IX enforcement, what triggers a school\u2019s legal obligation to respond to allegations and how a school must respond.\n\nCiting Supreme Court precedent, the proposal puts forth a narrow definition of harassment. Obama-era guidelines held that harassment was \u201cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.\u201d The proposed regulation defines it as \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a person access to the school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d\n\nThe regulation also limits the circumstances that would mandate a school respond to an incident. The school must have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the allegations. At colleges and universities, that means the incident must have been reported to \u201can official with authority to take corrective action,\u201d including the school\u2019s Title IX coordinator. For K-12 schools, the report could go to any teacher.\n\nIn addition, the incident must have occurred within a school\u2019s own programs or activities. That could include off-campus incidents if it were, for instance, in a building owned by the school, or at an event the school funded, sponsored, promoted or endorsed.\n\nOnce a school knows about an allegation, it is required to take it seriously. But the regulation specifies that it will be punished by the Education Department only if its actions are \u201cclearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe regulation also specifies that even if no formal complaint is filed, the school must offer the accuser supportive measures. It says colleges and universities doing this have a \u201csafe harbor\u201d from a later finding that they had failed to act. Elementary and secondary schools, however, may be required to file a formal complaint even if the victim does not want one, given \u201cthe need to protect younger students.\u201d\n\nIn investigating complaints, schools are required to implement a range of due-process procedures, including a presumption of innocence, the opportunity to present witnesses and evidence, and the right to an adviser or attorney at all phases of the process.\n\nHearings are optional for K-12 schools, but for colleges and universities, a final decision must be made at a hearing. Cross-examination must be allowed but conducted by advisers or attorneys, not by the parties themselves. The regulation also provides \u201crape shield protections,\u201d such as a bar on questions about an accuser\u2019s sexual history.\n\nSchools would be allowed to choose the standard they will use between \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d or the higher bar of \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d But a school may not use the lower standard if it relies on the higher one for allegations against employees, including faculty members.\n\nIn addition, the regulation would require that the final determination in a case be made by someone who did not conduct the investigation, nullifying arrangements often used in which a single investigator does both.\n\nThose procedural changes are important, said attorney Andrew Miltenberg of New York, who has represented more than 100 students accused of sexual misconduct. But he predicted that most universities will maintain the lower evidentiary standard in response to campus pressures.\n\n\u201cI think most universities are going to stay the course for fear of becoming ground zero for activists to say, \u2018Look how terrible rape victims are being treated at this university,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nHe said, though, that the new sexual harassment definition, requiring the behavior to be both severe and pervasive, \u201cmay be a little too restrictive.\u201d\n\nSuzanne Taylor, the University of California\u2019s interim systemwide Title IX coordinator, said the new rules will \u201creverse decades of well-established, hard-won progress toward equity\u201d but said the UC system would remain \u201csteadfast in its commitment to combating sexual violence.\u201d\n\nNick Anderson contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Travis Mitchell", "title": "5 new places to eat around Union Market (that aren\u2019t Union Market)", "description": "The food hall is constantly crowded.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) meets with Brett Kavanaugh in her office in August. (Alex Wroblewski/Reuters)\n\nWith Reis Thebault\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: There will not be a single Republican from New England in the U.S. House next year, after Maine\u2019s secretary of state announced Thursday afternoon that Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R) was narrowly defeated by Democratic challenger Jared Golden after an instant runoff using ranked-choice voting. That leaves Sen. Susan Collins of Maine as the sole Republican survivor among the 33 members of Congress from New England \u2014 and there\u2019s a real chance she\u2019ll either retire or be defeated in 2020.\n\n-- This can be viewed as part of the ongoing national realignment I\u2019ve highlighted over the past few weeks. There are notable exceptions like Joe Manchin or Conor Lamb, but as federal elections become more nationalized than ever, it\u2019s harder for moderate Democrats to get reelected in red states like Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. And the reverse is true for Republicans in blue states.\n\n-- This trend isn\u2019t new, of course, but it\u2019s been supercharged in the Trump era. President Trump won a single electoral vote from Maine in 2016 because he narrowly carried the very rural 2nd District, which Poliquin won in 2014 after it was held by Democrats for two decades. (The previous Republican to represent the district was Olympia Snowe, who gave it up to run for Senate in 1994.) That made Trump the first Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush won New Hampshire in 2000 to get any electoral votes at all from New England.\n\n-- Republicans have found success in New England governor\u2019s races of late because they\u2019re able to avoid the maw of Trump and the thicket of national issues. Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Chris Sununu in New Hampshire and Phil Scott in Vermont each won second terms this month. But Democrats handily picked up the Maine governorship after eight years of GOP Gov. Paul LePage.\n\n-- Collins voted against repealing Obamacare but for the GOP tax cuts. Perhaps her most consequential vote this Congress, however, was to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court after he was accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.\n\n-- Two moments on Thursday underscored why the left is more determined than ever to replace Collins in 2020:\n\nFirst, she announced that she will not join Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake\u2019s effort to oppose the confirmation of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees until the Senate votes on legislation to protect special counsel Bob Mueller. She says she still supports the underlying bill. If Collins joined Flake, because Republicans only have a 51-49 majority, McConnell would have no choice but to allow a vote on the Mueller bill because confirming judges is his top legislative priority.\n\n\u201cPredictably lame,\u201d replied former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, one of several prominent Democrats mulling a bid against Collins.\n\nSecond, Collins was cheered last night during a black-tie gala put on by the Federalist Society for her decisive vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh himself got a nearly minute-long standing ovation at the start of the dinner, which was held at Union Station, and he got another standing ovation later in the night, according to BuzzFeed. Kavanaugh, who denied Ford\u2019s account, was joined by fellow Republican justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito. McConnell and former White House counsel Don McGahn got a rock-star welcome when they took the stage. The majority leader then singled out Collins for praise during his remarks, and the room applauded. (I wrote yesterday about the FedSoc convention and Flake\u2019s fight to protect Mueller.)\n\n-- \u201cCollins, who is 65 and coming off two of the most punishing years of her Senate career, seems to be entering a particularly grim existential zone,\u201d Mark Leibovich writes in a Sunday profile for the New York Times Magazine. \u201cCollins has been maddening people across the political spectrum for years, of course; the main difference, maybe, is that people are just generally madder now. \u2026 Collins will soon say goodbye to two of her closest friends, the defeated Democrats Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. Heitkamp once described Collins as her 'role model' \u2014 and lost her re-election bid by 11 percentage points. I asked Collins who was left in the Senate whom she considered to be fellow moderates. She named Mark Warner of Virginia and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee but then stopped. \u2018I don\u2019t want to get people in trouble by calling them moderates,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u201cIn response to my compulsory query about whether she would run again, she replied with an equally compulsory \u2018Uh, I haven\u2019t really focused on it.\u2019 But really, her heart seemed not in the prospect at all. \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m human,\u2019 Collins felt the need to say. \u2018Sometimes people forget that, but it\u2019s difficult not to let the divisiveness wear you down.\u2019 Collins is pleasant and polite, which can obscure the fact that she is not easily intimidated. She is also the weather-weary Mainer who knows winter is coming.\u201d\n\n-- A wrinkle in Maine\u2019s 2nd District: This is the first time in U.S. history that a ranked-choice voting system determined the outcome of a federal election. When the votes first came in, Golden trailed Poliquin but both candidates were under 50 percent in the four-way race. A voter referendum that passed in 2016, which was upheld earlier in 2018, created what\u2019s called an instant runoff. Voters now rank their choices on the ballot. When no candidate gets a majority, the second choice of voters who back lower-performing candidates is factored in. In this case, the two independents got 8 percent of the vote. Their ballots were shipped to the capital in Augusta, where they were scanned. After the second-choice votes were factored in, Golden won with 50.5 percent of the vote to Poliquin\u2019s 49.5 percent.\n\nPoliquin sought a temporary restraining order from a federal judge to block this from happening, but he was denied. \u201cIt is now officially clear I won the constitutional \u2018one-person, one-vote\u2019 first choice election on Election Day that has been used in Maine for more than one hundred years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will proceed with our constitutional concerns about the rank vote algorithm.\u201d\n\nAfter being declared the winner, Golden touted the new system as superior to a month-long runoff. \u201cUsing ranked-choice voting, we\u2019ve determined a clear winner in a more timely manner than Louisiana and other states that hold runoff elections,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here: I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one in the state that\u2019s glad we used an instant-runoff system instead of holding another election. Who in this state wants to see another campaign commercial wedged in between Thanksgiving and Christmas?\u201d\n\nMany political scientists have spent years trying to get states to allow ranked-choice voting in federal races, not just state or local contests. From a FiveThirtyEight analyst:\n\nFor better or for worse, ranked-choice voting did exactly what it is intended to do in #ME02\u2014made a loser out of the plurality winner but a winner out of the person preferred by the most people. \u2014 Nathaniel Rakich (@baseballot) November 15, 2018\n\n-- Speaking of the national realignment: The Associated Press declared last night that Democrat Katie Porter, a protege of Elizabeth Warren, has defeated Rep. Mimi Walters (R-Calif.) in Orange County, which used to be one of the most conservative parts of the country during the era of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. This means Democrats will hold at least a 44-to-9 edge in the House delegation of the nation\u2019s most populous state, plus supermajorities in the state legislature and a 3.7-million advantage over the GOP in voter registration.\n\n\u201cThe latest update to the vote count gave Porter 51 percent and a 6,203-vote lead,\u201d the AP\u2019s Michael Blood reports. \u201cPorter, 44, campaigned on an unabashed liberal agenda and in direct opposition to Trump\u2019s priorities: She advocates overturning his tax reform package, supports universal health care, and endorses mandatory background checks on all gun sales and a ban on so-called assault-style weapons. The district has a 7-point Republican registration edge, and Walters was re-elected in 2016 by 17 points, even though Hillary Clinton carried the district by 5 points in 2016.\n\n\u201cWith Porter\u2019s win, Democrats have picked off three GOP seats either all or partly in Orange County, and they are threatening to win another district where votes continue to be counted. If Democrat Gil Cisneros wins that undecided race against Republican Young Kim in the 39th District where GOP Rep. Ed Royce is retiring, the county once considered Republican holy ground won\u2019t have a GOP representative in Congress. In returns Thursday, Cisneros climbed into a 941-vote lead, after Kim held the early lead.\u201d\n\n-- Farewell to Anne Li: Anne has been the producer of my daily podcast, The Big Idea, since we launched it in the summer of 2017.

(Sarah Kaplan)\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange greets supporters last year from a balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. (Frank Augstein/AP)\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been charged under seal, prosecutors inadvertently revealed in a recently unsealed court filing. Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report: \u201cThe disclosure came in a filing in a case unrelated to Assange. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kellen S. Dwyer, urging a judge to keep the matter sealed, wrote that \u2018due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged.\u2019 Later, Dwyer wrote the charges would \u2018need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested.\u2019\n\n\u201cFederal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia have long been investigating Assange and, in the Trump administration, had begun taking a second look at whether to charge members of the WikiLeaks organization for the 2010 leak of diplomatic cables and military documents that the anti-secrecy group published. Investigators also had explored whether WikiLeaks could face criminal liability for the more recent revelation of sensitive CIA cybertools. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III also has explored WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of emails from the Democratic National Committee and the account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s then-campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.\n\n\u201cIt was not immediately clear what charges Assange would face. In the past, prosecutors had contemplated pursuing a case involving conspiracy, theft of government property or violating the Espionage Act. But whether to charge the WikiLeaks founder was hardly a foregone conclusion. In the Obama administration, the Justice Department had concluded that pursuing Assange would be akin to prosecuting a news organization.\n\n\u201cEven if he is charged, Assange\u2019s coming to the United States to face trial is no sure thing. Since June 2012, Assange has been living in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London, afraid that if he steps outside he will be arrested. When he first sought asylum in the embassy, he was facing possible extradition to Sweden in a sex crimes case. \u2026 In the years since, the Swedish case has been closed, but Assange has said he cannot risk leaving the embassy because the United States would attempt to have him arrested and extradited for disclosures of U.S. government secrets. \u2026 If Assange were to leave the embassy and be arrested by British authorities, he would likely still fight extradition in the British courts.\u201d\n\n-- The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee is intensifying his calls for acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker to recuse himself from supervision of the special counsel\u2019s probe, citing Whitaker\u2019s friendship with a key witness in the investigation. Tom Hamburger and Rosalind S. Helderman report: \u201c\u2018There is a blatant conflict of interest here that demands recusal,\u2019 Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview. \u2018[Sam] Clovis is more than just a witness. He was the supervisor of the Trump Foreign Policy Advisory Committee, which included a cast of rogue characters.\u2019 Clovis, who served as national co-chairman of President Trump\u2019s campaign, was a key contact for two of Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisers who have come under scrutiny: George Papadopoulos, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and Carter Page, the subject of a secret intelligence warrant.\n\n\u201cClovis has been interviewed by [Mueller\u2019s] team, appeared before the grand jury probing Russian interference in the 2016 election and been called before congressional committees. The Iowa Republican activist has described the acting attorney general as a \u2018dear friend\u2019 and a longtime political ally. Whitaker chaired Clovis\u2019s bid for Iowa state treasurer. In a recent interview with Reuters, Clovis said Whitaker was a \u2018sounding board\u2019 for him when Clovis worked for Trump\u2019s campaign. After Whitaker was tapped by Trump to serve as acting attorney general last week, Clovis said he texted him congratulations.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cHalf a dozen people in contact with the White House and other Trump officials say a deep anxiety has started to set in that Mueller is about to pounce after his self-imposed quiet period, and that any number of Trump\u2019s allies and family members may soon be staring down the barrel of an indictment,\u201d Politico\u2019s Darren Samuelsohn reports. \u201cTelevision journalists on Monday morning captured footage of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen and his criminal defense attorney as they arrived at Union Station in Washington, fueling speculation he was in town for a meeting with the Mueller prosecutors.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump speaks Thursday at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nTHE LAME-DUCK AGENDA:\n\n-- \u201cTrump did not commit Thursday to avoiding a partial government shutdown next month if lawmakers don\u2019t give him money to build a border wall,\u201d Erica Werner and Damian Paletta report: \u201cSenate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) and other GOP leaders met with Trump on Thursday about ways to fund the government. Shelby said Trump did not commit to signing a bill that does not give him all the money he wants to fund construction of a wall along the Mexico border. Shelby said Trump was noncommittal about how he planned to proceed. \u2026 Trump\u2019s staff has warned him he may not get the full $5 billion he has demanded for new wall construction for 2019 \u2026 Although they retain full control of Congress for now, Republicans still need support from Democrats to pass any bill in the Senate.\u201d\n\n-- Whitaker let it be known that he has concerns with the bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that the president endorsed to great fanfare earlier in the week. Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cWhitaker has concerns with the \u2018drug part of the bill,\u2019 according to Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), and has spoken about the concerns with the National Narcotic Officers\u2019 Associations\u2019 Coalition. Whitaker\u2019s particular concern is how the bill would change drug sentences, and he told Graham that he has also expressed his issues with the bill to the president. \u2018He said he doesn\u2019t want to kill it,\u2019 Graham said Thursday. \u2018He just wanted to express his concerns.\u2019 The bill, formally introduced Thursday evening, would \u2026 lower mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, including reducing the \u2018three strikes\u2019 penalty from life behind bars to 25 years. It would also reduce mandatory minimum sentences that go into effect when a firearm is used during a violent crime or drug offense. Graham said that Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior White House adviser, had persuaded the president to support the bill.\u201d\n\n-- The White House released a list of Trump\u2019s priorities for the lame-duck session, and notably absent is any mention of the 10 percent tax cut the president promised he\u2019d get passed before the end of the year. Just like the migrant caravan, it appears the president touted the proposal in the final weeks of the campaign for purely political purposes.\n\nRonald D.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN:\n\n-- Ronald Vitiello, Trump's pick to lead U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, refused to rule out the possibility the administration will once again resort to separating migrant parents from their children at the U.S.-Mexico border. Maria Sacchetti reports: \u201cThe White House is discussing plans to detain asylum-seeking families for up to 20 days and then give parents a choice: Stay in jail with their child pending a deportation hearing, or allow children to be taken to a government shelter so other relatives or guardians can seek custody of them. 'That option and that discussion is underway,' Vitiello [said at his Senate confirmation hearing Thursday]. He would not address lawmakers\u2019 questions seeking clarity on how long he believed migrant children should be detained or whether the separation from their families caused them psychological harm.\u201d\n\n-- Three likely incoming Democratic chairs of House committees overseeing environmental issues vow that they\u2019ll grill several top Trump administration officials who have escaped meaningful oversight under GOP rule. Dino Grandoni and Juliet Eilperin: \u201cAfter eight years out of power in the House, Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson (Tex.), Ra\u00fal Grijalva (Ariz.) and Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.) are expected to lead the committees on Science, Space, and Technology; Natural Resources; and Energy and Commerce, respectively, after serving as the panels' ranking Democrats. In a slate of interviews, they outlined an expansive agenda to put a hot spotlight on the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of President Obama\u2019s climate agenda and to delve deep into alleged misconduct of officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, Interior Department and the Housing and Urban Development Department.\n\n\u201cAt the top of that list is Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Grijalva wants Zinke to testify before his committee about discussions surrounding a deal in Whitefish, Mont., between the Zinkes\u2019 family foundation and Halliburton chairman David Lesar along with other developers. \u2026 (He also) wants to know more about an incident last month in which Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson announced one of his top appointees would become Interior\u2019s acting inspector general. Days later, Interior officials called Carson\u2019s statement \u2018100 percent false\u2019 and said they would not hire HUD official Suzanne Israel Tufts.\n\n-- Under HUD Secretary Ben Carson, more families live in federally subsidized housing that fail health and safety inspections, despite Carson's pledge to fix up low-income housing. NBC News's Suzy Khimm, Laura Strickler, Hannah Rappleye and Stephanie Gosk report: \u201cMore than 1,000 out of HUD\u2019s nearly 28,000 federally subsidized multifamily properties failed their most recent inspection \u2014 a failure rate that is more than 30 percent higher than in 2016. ... More failing properties also mean that HUD has a bigger caseload of troubled homes to oversee. And rather than beefing up the department\u2019s staff to oversee them, HUD has lost hundreds of staff members in the wake of a hiring freeze mandated by [Trump]. ... At the same time, Carson has proposed raising rents on poor families, requiring them to pay a higher percentage of their income for housing.\u201d\n\n-- U.S. taxpayers shelled out nearly $100,000 to pay for Donald Trump Jr.'s trip to India to sell his family's luxury condominium projects. The Secret Service is authorized to provide protection for the president's family, but costs of that protection on such trips has been questioned. Annie Gowen reports: \u201cTrump Jr.\u2019s February trip cost more than $97,805 for hotel rooms, airfare, car rental and overtime for Secret Service agents. The costs were incurred on a February tour of four Indian cities \u2014 New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Kolkata \u2014 where the Trump family has licensed its name to luxury high-rise projects. Trump Jr., 40, is the executive vice president of the family real estate company that the president still owns, although the elder Trump says he has stepped back from day-to-day control. During his tour, Trump Jr. walked the red carpet, attended a ribbon-cutting at a high-rise overlooking the Arabian Sea in Mumbai, hosted champagne dinners for buyers and had a private t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi ... [Trump Jr.'s] team boasted to reporters that it had sold $100 million worth of the pricey flats, including $15 million in a single day.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos began receiving around-the-clock security from the U.S. Marshals Service days after being confirmed, an armed detail provided to no other cabinet member that could cost U.S. taxpayers $19.8 million through September of 2019,\u201d NBC\u2019s Heidi Przybyla reports. \u201cThe cost of security provided to DeVos was $5.3 million in fiscal year 2017 and $6.8 million for fiscal year 2018, according to the Marshals Service \u2014 an amount that is ultimately reimbursed by the Education Department. The estimated cost for fiscal year 2019 is $7.74 million. \u2026 After receiving the Marshals' protection, DeVos spent less than 4 percent of her time visiting traditional public schools in the school year that began in September 2017, according to a tabulation by NBC News and the watchdog group American Oversight.\"\n\nTHE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE:\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi insisted she has the votes to become the next House speaker, even as a potential challenger emerged. John Wagner, Paul Kane and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cIn a flurry of one-on-one meetings, Pelosi courted wavering lawmakers, paying particular attention to the incoming, majority-making class of freshmen. She appeared to make headway as leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus described their session with her as a 'productive and successful conversation' ... The veteran Democratic leader is also relying on an aggressive outside campaign to lobby lawmakers, made up of liberal interest group leaders and high-profile Democrats, including one of former president Barack Obama\u2019s closest advisers \u2014 former chief of staff Denis McDonough.\n\n\u201cThe powerful liberal organization, MoveOn, endorsed Pelosi while civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said she has 'demonstrated the proven, tested leadership we need to confront the issues before our nation.' Pelosi remains short of the votes necessary, with solid opposition from at least 19 Democrats. Her first critical test is Nov. 28 in a secret-ballot contest among Democrats and then again in the higher-stakes public roll call of the entire House on Jan. 3.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio) has emerged as Pelosi's foremost potential challenger, despite being far from a star in the national Democratic Party. Robert Costa and Elise Viebeck report: \u201cFudge isn\u2019t a member of her party\u2019s leadership and she\u2019s now a few years removed from her stint as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. ... But Fudge, 66, embraced her relative anonymity on a rainy Thursday morning in her congressional office, casting herself as a symbol of the backbone of her party as she considers challenging [Pelosi] in the race for House speaker. 'Where are we recognized?' Fudge asked in an interview with The Washington Post, as she discussed black women and the House leadership. 'If we\u2019re going to have a diverse party, it ought to look like the party.'\n\n\u201cFudge this week became the first Democrat to publicly acknowledge a possible bid against Pelosi, rupturing party ranks in the afterglow of this month\u2019s midterm elections and Democrats\u2019 return to power in the House \u2014 and raising fresh questions about the depth of Pelosi\u2019s support ... Fudge\u2019s record is coming under immediate scrutiny, with Pelosi allies privately arguing to on-the-fence Democrats that Fudge\u2019s refusal to co-sponsor the Equality Act, which focuses on civil rights protections for sexual orientation and gender identity, makes her a non-starter. ... Fudge dismissed the criticism and said that she supports gay rights, but not the way that particular bill was handled.\u201d\n\n-- In a critical show of support for Pelosi, prominent CBC members backed her over Fudge, according to Politico.\n\n-- The HuffPost's Matt Fuller has the names on the much awaited letter of those opposing Pelosi \u2014 they number 17 Democrats at the moment, though Pelosi foes want to wait to release it until they can count 20 among them.\n\n-- Significant for good governance: House Democrats are proposing to make substantial changes to the chamber\u2019s rules as they prepare to take the majority. Mike DeBonis obtained a draft document outlining the changes: \u201cAmong other things, the proposed reforms would potentially slow down the process for bringing legislation to a floor vote, make it easier to call up a bill that has bipartisan support but is opposed by the majority party\u2019s leadership, and give committees a stronger role in drafting legislation. The list of proposals \u2026 is not considered to be final and could be substantially modified before the rules are adopted in January, but the changes floated Thursday have the backing of Pelosi and incoming Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.).\n\n\u201cTaken together, the proposals seek to address Democrats' concerns about the way the outgoing Republican majority ran the chamber but also bipartisan complaints about more-persistent weaknesses in House operations. The proposed rule changes require more time for the review of legislation before a floor vote, changing the standard from three days \u2014 which often means a little more than 24 hours \u2014 to a full 72 hours. They would require every bill sent to the floor by the Rules Committee to get a committee hearing and markup before getting a floor vote. They would create a supermajority requirement to raise individual income taxes on the lowest-earning four-fifths of taxpayers. And they would require each legislative committee to hold \u2018Member Days\u2019 to solicit legislative ideas from lawmakers who don\u2019t serve on those committees.\u201d\n\nMORE MIDTERM FALLOUT:\n\n-- Ron DeSantis (R) appears almost certain to win the Florida governor's race, emerging from a machine recount with a clear lead, while the Senate race will go to a manual recount with Gov. Rick Scott (R) narrowly ahead of Sen. Bill Nelson (D). Beth Reinhard, Sean Sullivan, Amy Gardner and Lori Rozsa report: \u201cThe Senate battle ... enters a phase reminiscent of the state\u2019s 2000 presidential recount \u2014 in which local elections officials will examine tens of thousands of ballots that may not have been filled out or tallied correctly to assess voters\u2019 intentions. The process was triggered because Scott\u2019s lead, 12,603 votes out of more than 8 million cast, remained within the 0.25 percent legal threshold for a manual recount, which must be completed by noon Sunday. That narrow margin appeared too much for Nelson to overcome. Scott called for Nelson to bow out as Nelson\u2019s attorney expressed confidence that the second recount, plus court cases, would let Nelson overtake Scott. 'It\u2019s never been our view that there was going to be one silver bullet that was going to change the margin in this race,' Nelson\u2019s lead recount attorney, Marc Elias, said on a call with reporters. The hand count, he added, 'is what we\u2019ve been seeking all along.'\n\n\u201cThe big winner of the day appeared to be DeSantis, whose lead over Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, remained wide enough to avoid a manual recount. His victory is set to be certified early next week. DeSantis\u2019s ascent would represent a major victory for President Trump, who handpicked the congressman when he was an underdog in the GOP primary and headlined two rallies in Florida in the campaign\u2019s closing days ... DeSantis said in a statement that he was focused on his transition to governor and invited Gillum to meet with him. ... Gillum refused to concede, saying in a statement that 'there are tens of thousands of votes that have yet to be counted.'\u201d\n\n-- \u201cSen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) is facing backlash for her remarks once again after saying laws that \u2018make it just a little more difficult\u2019 for some college students to vote are \u2018a great idea,\u2019\u201d Michael Brice-Saddler reports. \u201cThe recording shows Hyde-Smith telling a small crowd in Starkville, Miss., that \u2018They remind me that there\u2019s a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who maybe we don\u2019t want to vote. Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u2019\n\n\u201cHyde-Smith\u2019s campaign released a statement Thursday saying that she was joking and that the video was \u2018selectively edited.\u2019 The video was posted Thursday by Lamar White Jr., a blogger and journalist who also posted a video of Hyde-Smith this week in which she\u2019s heard joking that if she were invited to a public hanging, she\u2019d \u2018be on the front row.\u2019 Hyde-Smith is facing Democrat Mike Espy in a Nov. 27 runoff to determine who will serve the remaining two years of Republican Sen. Thad Cochran\u2019s term. \u2026 Espy\u2019s communication director, Danny Blanton, said Hyde-Smith talking about voter suppression was \u2018not a laughing matter\u2019 and called her a \u2018walking stereotype.\u2019\u201d\n\nImportant reminder: The Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a central part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by arguing that officials aiming to restrict voting rights wasn't something we need to worry about anymore.\n\n-- Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) gleefully stoked speculation that he\u2019ll run for president in 2020 during a day of campaign-style events in New Hampshire, Dave Weigel reports from Concord.\n\n-- Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.) was formally tapped as the new chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She's the first Latina to lead the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm. (Felicia Sonmez)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- NBC News reports the Trump White House is reviewing ways to extradite one of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's enemies from the United States in an attempt to placate Turkey after Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Istanbul. Carol E. Lee, Julia Ainsley and Courtney Kube report: \u201cTrump administration officials last month asked federal law enforcement agencies to examine legal ways of removing exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen in an attempt to persuade Erdogan to ease pressure on the Saudi government ... The effort includes directives to the Justice Department and FBI that officials reopen Turkey's case for his extradition, as well as a request to the Homeland Security Department for information about his legal status ... The White House specifically wanted details about Gulen's residency status in the U.S. Gulen has a Green Card, according to two people familiar with the matter. He has been living in Pennsylvania since the late 1990s.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThe Senate on Thursday voted against an effort to block an arms sale to Bahrain \u2014 pitched by backers as a means of forcing the island nation to stop participating in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen,\u201d Karoun Demirjian reports. \u201cIt was shot down by a majority of senators over concerns it would expose the United States to greater dangers in the Persian Gulf region.\u201d\n\n-- What\u2019s next: A bipartisan group of senators is poised to introduce legislation imposing sanctions, prohibitions and restrictions against Saudi Arabia and other entities considered responsible for the humanitarian suffering in Yemen. Demirjian reports: \u201cThe group, which is led by Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) and includes Trump confidant Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), is calling for a total prohibition on arms sales to Saudi Arabia that could be used for offensive purposes.\u201d\n\n-- Saudi Arabia is pushing for a deep cut in oil output, upset with the Trump administration's offer of waivers that would keep more Iranian crude on the market. Reuters's Rania El Gamal and Dmitry Zhdannikov report: \u201cAngered by the U.S. move that has raised worries about over supply, Saudi Arabia is now considering cutting output with OPEC and its allies by about 1.4 million barrels per day or 1.5 percent of global supply ... Washington has said the waivers are a temporary concession to allies that imported Iranian crude and might have struggled to find other supplies quickly when U.S. sanctions were imposed on Nov. 4.\u201d\n\n-- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has inspected a \u201cnewly developed high-tech tactical\u201d weapon, state media said on Friday, without specifying what kind of weapon was tested. Simon Denyer and Min Joo Kim report from Seoul: \u201cNorth Korea has suspended nuclear and missile tests as it endeavors to improve relations with the outside world, and there was no indication that this weapon was nuclear-related or a missile. The U.S. State Department said it remained confident that promises made by Kim at his summit meeting with President Trump in Singapore in June would be fulfilled. Nevertheless, the announcement marked the first time Kim had made a high-profile visit to a military site since that summit, and the first announcement of any weapons test this year.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nA Los Angeles Times reporter was one of several journalists who chose to publicly disclose being contacted by the FBI:\n\nSurreal moment: I just got a visit from two special agents for the FBI who informed me that Cesar Sayoc, the suspected pipe bomber, conducted searches of my name before he was arrested.\n\n\n\nFellow reporters, be vigilant! \u2014 Jenny Jarvie (@JennyJarvie) November 14, 2018\n\nA National Review writer who has been critical of the president was also a person who drew Sayoc's interest:\n\nYep, the FBI reached out to us last night, and today I spoke to an agent who told me the mail bomber researched me and searched for my address.

Membership revenue declined by $35 million last year, and the NRA recently rolled out its second dues increase in as many years. In May, the gun group sued Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, claiming that his state\u2019s zealous regulatory efforts against its Carry Guard insurance program had cost the NRA \u2018tens of millions of dollars\u2019 in lost revenue, legal fees, and other damages. (A federal judge recently ruled that the suit can go forward.) Perhaps the most vivid evidence of belt-tightening at the NRA was its drastically reduced spending on the 2018 midterm elections. The group shelled out just under $10 million on House and Senate candidates this cycle \u2014 less than half of what it spent on congressional races in 2014 and 2016.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT \u201cA fight broke out in a closed-door meeting of House Democrats over climate change as a powerful veteran lawmaker fought with freshman star Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members-elect over the creation of a special panel for the issue,\u201d per Politico\u2019s Anthony Adragna, John Bresnahan and Zack Colman. \u201cPallone, incoming chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee \u2014 backed by a number of other committee members \u2014 slammed the creation of the new climate panel \u2026 Pallone argued that his committee and other existing panels within the House could take on the issue aggressively.

You see, the conventional wisdom told us that the country is hopelessly polarized, so Trump had no choice but to stoke the fires in deep-red states. Events such as the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh are vital to the party\u2019s future.\n\nThen the results came in. Republicans will wind up losing nearly 40 House seats, lost Arizona and Nevada Senate seats, lost at least seven governorships and were routed in the suburbs, among women and college-educated voters. In other words, the operating theory of super polarization didn\u2019t work in a real election. The price of winning deep-red Senate seats (this is not supposed to be hard) was a disaster outside Trump\u2019s niche.\n\nI have long suspected that political elites are far more polarized than the voters, or at least the center is much bigger than politicians, academics and media folks would have you believe. The strong showing of Democratic moderates, especially in the suburbs, suggests that Democrats need not go far left as Trump goes far right; to the contrary, the large center is wide open if Democrats run appropriate candidates.\n\nA poll conducted by the center-left group Third Way provides some evidence for my hypothesis:\n\nIn our election-eve poll, the predominantly mainstream and moderate Democratic candidates running in the battleground districts led with women by 14 points, voters of color by 35 points, and those under 35 by 15 points. These candidates had overwhelming support with self-identified Democrats, but they also led by nine points with Independents. And they matched Republicans\u2019 support with high school graduates while winning college graduates by seven points. These data and the election results show that voters gravitated to and voted for a diverse slate of pragmatic progressives who centered their agenda on core issues like health care. Voters resoundingly rejected Sanders-style policies like Medicare for All.\n\nMoreover, voters seem to embrace values Republicans once advocated. \u201cSeventy-two percent said hard work is very important to getting ahead in life. Fifty-eight percent of Democrats and Independents said they wanted a 2020 candidate who would focus on expanding opportunity to more people and places, while 31% prioritized someone who would focus on reducing income inequality.\u201d This suggests that Democrats would get behind a candidate whose articulation of values and policy stances would attract a broad ideological coalition \u2014 unless, of course, they go the route of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Richard Cordray (who lost the governor\u2019s race in Ohio).\n\nSince only 16 percent of Democrats said they wanted a more progressive choice, the poll undercuts the notion that center-left candidates aren\u2019t satisfactory to the Democratic base. It turns out that such candidates were ideologically in line with Democratic voters \u2014 and able to win general elections all over the country.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t need and don\u2019t want their own pugilist. (\u201cEighty-eight percent wanted someone who would work across party lines to bring the country together; just eight percent wanted a candidate who will be uncompromising in pursuit of their policy goals.\u201d) Moderate policy, pragmatic politics and diverse, center-left candidates turned out to be a winning formula.\n\nThe race also suggests that the GOP paid the price in a major way for Trump\u2019s and the GOP\u2019s shameful treatment of Christine Blasey Ford and sexual assault victims who chose to peacefully protest; their attempt to make white males into the country\u2019s greatest victims; and their loud, bullying and rude tone. Sure, they really got their numbers up in North Dakota, but look where the backlash wiped them out.\n\nAxios reports that a post-election analysis from consultants found, \u201cDemocrats won 87% of the Congressional districts with the most college-educated women (40%+ of female residents).\u201d One of the consultants, Bruce Mehlman, is quoted as saying, \u201cThe new geography of Trump Era partisanship is turning suburban congressional districts into GOP killing fields, more than offsetting gerrymander gains by mobilizing intense opposition among college educated women, the beating heart of the suburbs.\u201d\n\nIn short, Trump\u2019s bombastic tone, racism and failure to focus on the middle class (in fact, policies such as Obamacare repeal would have hurt these Americans) have repelled women, who in turn led the suburbs into Democratic territory. The Democrats who won include a record number of women whose tone and approach contrasted greatly with Trump\u2019s incitement over the migrant caravan. Rather than imitate Trump by getting their own obnoxious, extreme character, Democrats would be well advised to find someone whose temperament is professional and who exhibits some common sense and familiarity with reality.\n\nFor voters who may never have voted for Democrats, the 2018 midterms were a leap of faith. They are prepared to join with Democratic voters, who far from Bernie Sanders socialists, sound fairly moderate. This, however, is a trial marriage of sorts; if Democrats roll out their own Trumpian demagogue and start sounding as radical as the GOP, suburban turf might go back into the GOP\u2019s hands. Democrats should proceed with care."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/RickNoackTWP/", "title": "What it would take to dump British Prime Minister Theresa May", "description": "There are two key scenarios.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/16/what-it-would-take-dump-british-prime-minister-theresa-may/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NRLRWmE2Cdnn2dgsu2xB5c4OKdg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2TFV6JXJQMI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:06:18Z", "content": "British Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure from all sides, including hard-line Brexiteers within her own conservative party.

May\u2019s era as prime minister has been declared over before, and she has shown no signs of giving in to her critics.\n\nBut staying in office isn\u2019t entirely up to May herself. There are two key scenarios that might result in her departure.\n\nChances of the first scenario \u2014 a no-confidence vote triggered by her own party \u2014 increased on Friday, as at least 20 letters were submitted by Conservative Party members of Parliament, demanding a vote on May\u2019s future. That\u2019s still far from the required threshold of 48 letters (or 15 percent of all Tory MPs), but delegates are not required to make their submissions public.\n\nSo, when key party officials were ordered back to London on Friday morning, warning signs mounted that a leadership vote may be imminent. Triggering the procedure alone would not topple the British prime minister, as she could survive if a simple majority of Tory MPs backed her.\n\nA substantial number of lawmakers would likely opt to keep May in power to prevent a so-called \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit, which has been embraced by some hard-line conservative MPs. As a new British government would probably not have sufficient time to negotiate a new deal with the European Union on the country\u2019s terms of departure, the nation would crash out of the bloc -- potentially resulting in food shortages and job losses, according to some governmental scenarios. On top of that, any successor would face the same unrealistic expectations from all sides of the political spectrum that have derailed May\u2019s plans.\n\n[Can Brexit be stopped? A guide for those just waking up to Britain\u2019s political nightmare.]\n\nBut hard-line MPs in favor of getting rid of May would point to a Tory rule that would prevent another leadership challenge for at least a year. Following substantial election losses last year, May\u2019s era was widely believed to be doomed. Her party critics \u2014 who are far more numerous than the hardcore Brexiteers behind the current challenge \u2014 may be unwilling to essentially grant her at least another year in office.\n\nAnd while May might survive the rebellion on paper, an unexpectedly high number of votes against her would put additional pressure on her to resign.\n\nEven if May did not face a Tory challenge or survived it, her government may still run into another obstacle that is also connected to last year\u2019s election outcome. After May\u2019s Conservatives fell short of a parliamentary majority, the prime minister negotiated a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d power-sharing agreement with Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party.\n\nThe DUP has threatened to withdraw from that agreement several times. The party reportedly repeated those threats this week, indicating that it may withdraw unless May is removed as party leader because her deal with the E.U. may result in some regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe DUP believes that such checks could tear the country apart. If the DUP were to withdraw from its agreement with the Conservative Party, the Tories could still try to agree on a similar deal with another opposition party \u2014 but none of those parties are in favor of the Tory hard-liners' Brexit vision, either. Ousting May that way would increase the chances of new elections and, perhaps, of a second referendum.\n\nRead more:\n\nCan Brexit be stopped?

The main difficulty in the Brexit talks has been how to not disturb that liberty, which has helped to ensure peace since 1998.\n\nThe big fear in this region is that Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan, which aims to safeguard an open border, will fall apart and the U.K. will leave the EU with no deal on future relations. Overnight, that could bring back customs checks and police watch-points.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be horrified - absolutely horrified - if there was some sort of border,\u201d said Jim Deary, who lives in nearby Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland and, at the age of 95, can recall the violence that plagued the region for decades.\n\nJust across the invisible border, which is now physically represented by nothing more than a placid river, the sentiment is much the same.\n\n\u201cBritain is facing, and Northern Ireland is facing, absolute chaos,\u201d says Conor Patterson, the CEO of an agency that promotes economic growth in Northern Irish border regions of Newry and Mourne. \u201cThis is not a theoretical risk, these are real risks.\u201d\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Catholic and Protestant communities remain divided decades after 30 years of conflict claimed around 3,700 lives. The peace agreement signed in 1998 provides people with the freedom to identify as Irish or British, or both. Having a border could rekindle identity politics and, potentially, violence.\n\nMay\u2019s deal involves a common customs arrangement for the U.K. and the EU, eliminating the need for border checks, with some provisions that are specific to Northern Ireland. Pro-Brexiteers say that would leave the U.K. too close to the EU, taking its rules for years, and some are trying to get rid of May \u2014 as well as her deal, which is due to be voted on in Parliament.\n\nEconomically, this region has a lot to lose from a return of tariffs and customs checks.\n\nIn the days of hard borders, trade between the north and south was a fraction of what it is today. It took truck drivers hours to get cleared and across the other side.\n\nOn average, commercial vehicles cross the border 13,000 times each day. Some go back and forth several times in a single day. So do ships carrying goods to and from the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. An estimated 30,000 people cross the border every day.\n\nThe dividing line stretches for 500 kilometers (312 miles) and is dotted with over 250 official road crossings, more than on Europe\u2019s entire eastern flank.\n\nFor entrepreneurs who founded and grew their businesses here, taking advantage of the highway connecting Dublin to Belfast, the return of border checks is unthinkable.\n\nPaddy Hughes has a company selling horse supplements and his factory is smack on the border, on the north side. If you walk out left from his gate you\u2019re on the south side.\n\nHe has already felt an impact from Brexit, with sales down 35 percent as buyers in the U.K., where the pound has fallen sharply since the 2016 Brexit vote, worry about the future.\n\n\u201cPeople are unsure how to spend their money, whether to spend their money, where their next money is coming from, how much their money is going to be worth, how much things are going to cost in the future, whether they will have a job,\u201d he says.\n\nSome vestiges of the old borders are visible outside Newry, where weeds grow tall around an abandoned customs clearance post where goods used to be checked. Graffiti now covers the metal gates of the inspection booths.\n\nLooking back into the past, Deary recalls when as a child he would go swimming at a spot across the border and had to face border guards.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult. Cars were searched and you were asked for identity,\u201d he says. \u201cSince the borders (are open) it is terrific.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Robert Reiners/Getty Images)\n\nNeed some quick tips to assemble your fantasy lineup for Week 11? With a whopping six teams on their bye week, we\u2019ve combed the far reaches of the Internet and culled only the choicest fantasy tips and advice for your consumption. Below you\u2019ll find easily digestible nuggets from multiple fantasy experts, addressing some of the critical situations fantasy owners will face from week to week.\n\nDig in. And dominate.\n\n[The fantasy football players you need in your Week 11 lineup]\n\nInjury Decisions\n\nJoe Flacco, QB, Ravens: Flacco hasn\u2019t been that relevant in fantasy leagues, but for those of you heading toward a postseason berth with a mid-tier quarterback, consider that Flacco and Baltimore face the Chiefs and Buccaneers in Weeks 14 and 15. You never know who you might have to take a shot with in a must-win game; those matchups on the surface are quite appealing no matter the quarterback. As an owner who is riding the fence to a playoff berth with Matthew Stafford as his primary QB, Flacco in those playoff weeks could be tantalizing.\n\nA.J. Green, WR, Bengals: While it remains possible that Green could play, all signs point to him missing another week with his toe injury. Certainly if he gives it a go, he\u2019s pretty impossible to keep on the bench even if you still have reservations. The bad news is Green could be out until December.\n\nSammy Watkins, WR, Chiefs: Watkins may be listed on the injury report (foot), but the brittle wide receiver is going to be fine for a potential shootout against his former team, the Rams. Watkins is worth starting mostly because L.A.'s defense is surrendering plenty of yardage. Watkins is worth a shot if you\u2019re in need at WR2/flex.\n\n[NFL Week 11 fantasy football player rankings]\n\nFringe Starters\n\nTyler Boyd, WR, Bengals: Cincinnati is mired in a slump, having dropped three of four games. A.J. Green will miss his second consecutive week and Baltimore\u2019s pass coverage will key on limiting Boyd. Boyd was solid if unspectacular in Week 10, catching three balls for 65 yards. But while he\u2019s bound to receive several targets by default, Sunday\u2019s matchup could end up being a tough one for the Bengals' wideout.\n\nDoug Martin, RB, Raiders: In the wake of Marshawn Lynch\u2019s injury, Martin has picked up the slack. In each of his past three games, he\u2019s gained at least 69 yards from scrimmage. While most of his yardage comes on the ground, he adds a couple of receptions here and there. The Raiders have been abysmal on offense the past few weeks and face the Cardinals in one of two Sunday afternoon games (thanks for that NFL schedule-makers). Martin managed solid numbers a week ago against a solid Chargers defense and now gets to face an Arizona defense that struggles to stop the run. Martin seems like a reasonable RB2/flex play with a great chance of adding a score to his yardage total.\n\nGolden Tate, WR, Eagles: Count me among the Tate owners who came away from Week 10 wondering just how useful the newest addition to Philadelphia\u2019s wide receiving corps will be for the remainder of the season. Owners dealing with bye weeks and/or other depth issues may not have a choice but to go with Tate. In what could very well be a high-scoring affair in Sunday\u2019s game against the Saints, Tate certainly has appeal, but there is some risk given his new surroundings.\n\nTyrell Williams, WR, Chargers: A few weeks ago it seemed Williams was beginning to warrant weekly consideration. But here\u2019s the thing: To a larget extent, Williams is always going to be a feast or famine player in the Chargers' offense. In San Diego, barring injuries, the food chain on receptions starts with Keenan Allen and Melvin Gordon, in no particular order. Williams has received more than five targets just once this season (Week 10). Williams is still available in 60 percent of ESPN leagues. He\u2019s listed here because it seems extreme to list him as a long shot. Against a Denver secondary that has been vulnerable, Williams could produce a serviceable fantasy game. An WR2 might be a stretch, but a flex play is certainly a consideration.\n\n[Week 11 waiver wire moves: With six teams on a bye, here\u2019s whom to add]\n\nLottery Tickets That Could Pay Off\n\nEli Manning, QB, Giants: Manning is available in nearly 85 percent of ESPN leagues. With six teams on a bye and a home game against the Tampa Bay secondary, that number seems low. He could be a sneaky play in daily formats as well. This is all about the matchup and it\u2019s a good one for New York\u2019s passing game.\n\nJosh Reynolds, WR, Rams: With the season-ending injury to Cooper Kupp, Reynolds is bound to see an uptick in playing time. Given the explosiveness of L.A.'s offense, Reynolds certainly could be worth a flyer. But don\u2019t be surprised to see a heavy dose of Todd Gurley in Week 11. The Rams can still pound the ball while keeping Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs' offense off the field. If that is the game plan for the Rams, it could mean a dialed back passing game Monday night. Even with him being a popular pickup, Reynolds remains available in 79 percent of ESPN leagues.\n\n***This post is updated each Friday afternoon with additional information on injuries and other player-related news."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Top NFL prospect Ed Oliver and Houston Coach Major Applewhite got into an in-game argument over a coat - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Top NFL prospect Ed Oliver and Houston Coach Major Applewhite got into an in-game argument over a coat Washington Post It's been a frustrating season for Houston defensive tackle Ed Oliver.

(Tim Warner/Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s been a frustrating season for Houston defensive tackle Ed Oliver. After being named a consensus all-American as a sophomore in 2017, he announced before this season even began that he planned to depart for the NFL after his junior campaign, only to be felled by a knee injury against Navy on Oct. 20. He hasn\u2019t played since, and during Thursday night\u2019s game against Tulane, ESPN\u2019s cameras caught him getting into a sideline argument with Cougars Coach Major Applewhite over a coat, of all things.\n\nJust before halftime, Applewhite told Oliver to remove a heavy team coat that apparently is reserved for active players. As the team was heading to the locker room, Oliver had words for his coach and had to be restrained by Rod Grace, the team\u2019s director of sports performance.\n\nBizarre.

Applewhite, meanwhile, tried to play down the incident.\n\n\u201cHe got emotional, but he\u2019s young and that\u2019s what happens,\u201d he said, per the Associated Press. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not playing. That\u2019s hard. That\u2019s difficult. I don\u2019t hold anything against anyone. I\u2019m just going to visit with him about it. I love him. I want him to be a part of our team. I want him to be with our team.\u201d\n\nApplewhite added that he had told other nonactive players to take off the coats. The AP says it was around 50 degrees during the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be fair,\u201d he said.\n\nOliver is projected to be a top 10 pick in next year\u2019s draft, though he slid down from No. 2 to No. 7 on Mel Kiper\u2019s latest Big Board, which came out Wednesday. Considering that he\u2019s already declared his intention to leave for the NFL, one has to think his knee injury is weighing heavily on him: He suffered it on a blatant, non-penalized chop block by Navy\u2019s offensive line during their game on Oct. 20.\n\nIt was far from the first time Oliver\u2019s knees had been targeted by opposing offensive linemen. Last season against Temple, he suffered a sprained MCL on a low block.\n\nHouston closes out the regular season at Memphis on Nov. 23 and will play in the AAC title game if it wins that one and SMU loses one of its final two games. Considering everything that\u2019s happened this season, however, no one should be surprised if Oliver continues to sit things out, though Applewhite says the door is open.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always ready for him to come back,\u201d he said.\n\nMore from The Post:\n\nThe college football games you need to watch this weekend\n\nCollege football kickoff Week 12: The SEC pauses in the home stretch\n\nCollege football betting Week 12: Fade SEC teams during their annual November siestas?\n\nPlayoff rankings maintain status quo with no movement in top 10\n\nAs conference races wind down, which ones matter?"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Funeral prayers held in Istanbul for slain Saudi journalist", "description": "Funeral prayers have been held in Istanbul for journalist Jamal Khashoggi more than a month after his slaying at the Saudi Consulate", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/funeral-prayers-held-in-istanbul-for-slain-saudi-journalist/2018/11/16/3aeb250c-e9a2-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:19:22Z", "content": "ISTANBUL Funeral prayers have been held in Istanbul for journalist Jamal Khashoggi more than a month after his slaying at the Saudi Consulate.

In its mathematical gallery, though, there is a cabinet of not-needing-to-wonder. The sets of weights stored in its 71 mahogany drawers like toys in a hyper-organized toy box provided Lord Castlereagh, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, with welcome certainty about what weighed what around the world. They had been furnished, at Castlereagh\u2019s command, by British consuls abroad, so that what counted as a libra in Rio de Janeiro could be compared with a funt from St. Petersburg or a pound from Philadelphia; and the discrepancies between them \u2014 in ounces, zolotniks and on\u00e7as \u2014 recognized and accounted for.\n\nThe cabinet is a doubly worldly object. It covers the whole wide world of early-19th-century trade, and it evinces a worldly acceptance of human disparity and vagary. Not for Castlereagh the idealism of trying to set up a single global system of measurement, as revolutionary France had done with its invention of the meter (one 40,000,000th of the Earth\u2019s circumference) and the kilogram (one 1,000th of the weight of a cubic meter of pure water). Whether it was in weights and measures or the rights of man, such universalism was deeply suspect. That His Majesty\u2019s government should know for sure what the foreigners were talking about was quite sufficient.\n\nIn the 200 years since, though, the world has slowly come to prefer highfalutin\u2019 Gallic universalism to pragmatic British interoperability. When scientists measured the same things as tradesmen \u2014 lengths, breadths, weights and the like \u2014 they could make use of the customary units that came to hand (some of which, like the span, were actually based on the hand). But once they started to measure things beyond the immediate realm of the senses, such as electric charges and magnetic moments, they needed units of their own.\n\n[How photos of Earth from space changed humans]\n\nThese were developed systematically, and the resulting International System of Units saw the kilogram and the meter, which had gone into brief eclipse after the restoration of the French monarchy, returned to scientific and everyday use. In almost all countries \u2014 including, since 1963, Britain \u2014 the kilogram is the official unit of mass. Only the United States, Liberia and Myanmar have held out.\n\nBut knowing what weighs a kilogram still requires that, like one of Castlereagh\u2019s civil servants, you have some physical basis of comparison. In the case of the kilogram, the ultimate comparator has, for more than a century, been a precisely machined archetype made of platinum and iridium and housed in a vault in Paris, \u201cLe Grand K.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, this ended, as the International Committee for Weights and Measures abandoned Le Grand K. From now on, the committee will instead define mass purely in terms of the frequency of a particular resonance in cesium atoms and two universal constants: Planck\u2019s constant, ubiquitous in quantum mechanics, and the speed of light.\n\nThis does not just mean that that singular lump of platinum and iridium can finally lay down the burden of being the most precisely calibrated burden there is and move on to a comfortable retirement in a suitable museum. It is the end of an era more generally. The Paris kilogram was the last link between the way that humankind \u2014 or at least the scientific and legalistic bits of it \u2014 measures the universe and any individual objects within it.\n\n[The time I took Stephen Hawking to a cowboy bar]\n\nOnce there was a specific physical standard for the meter, too \u2014 a rod of metal that neither expanded nor contracted. Other units were defined in more general but still specifically earthly ways. The second was one 86,400th of a day \u2014 a period of time that astronomers calculated obsessively. More reconditely, the candlepower, a predecessor to the candela, the unit by which the brightness of light is now measured, was defined until the first half of the 20th century in terms of the light produced by a candle made from pure spermaceti \u2014 the wax from a sperm whale\u2019s head \u2014 burning at a rate of 120 grains an hour. The grain, in its turn, was a measure of mass dating back to what King Offa (an Anglo-Saxon monarch better known for constructing defenses against the marauding Welsh) reckoned a grain of wheat weighed.\n\nAll this history and specificity is now washed away. The seven basic units of measurement from which all other units of measurement are derived \u2014 the kilogram, the second, the meter, the ampere (electric current), the candela, the Kelvin (temperature) and the mole (the unit of quantity) \u2014 will be defined in terms of constants that should be the same everywhere in the universe. Some of these constants play profound roles in physics: As well as Planck\u2019s constant, there is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, which crops up in the laws of thermodynamics, and the speed of light in a vacuum, a quantity so central to relativity that it might as well be called as Einstein\u2019s constant. Others are arbitrary, like that particular property of cesium atoms that, through its frequency, defines the second. But all of them are universal, the same on a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri as they are on Earth. No standards in vaults need be consulted; no sperm whales need give up their wax.\n\n[Air Force One meets the Space Force]\n\nThere is a depth to this decision that goes beyond metrological tidiness. If humankind cannot agree on universal rights, it can at least agree on universal amperes, defined only by the behavior of any cesium atom and the charge on any electron. It is hard not to think us a little grander as a result. But also a bit more exposed. In dispensing with the props of specifically earthly measures, we face the universe on its own terms.\n\nEdmund Burke, an Irish conservative of the generation before Castlereagh\u2019s, understood the sublime as the apprehension of nature\u2019s fearful power from a vantage point of personal safety. The feeling some adults experience on the death of their parents \u2014 a sense of being, finally and irrevocably, on the front line and of looking eternity, or its absence, in the face \u2014 is a form of that sublime. And there is something of the same feeling in abandoning measures that have stories, measures that can be secured in comforting boxes, old measures from and of the human world, in favor of the unyielding, inhuman constants of the uncaring universe.\n\nIt is a small change in outlook \u2014 you would be hard put to quantify it, whatever units you used. But perhaps you can feel it.\n\n[CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said that a meter was one-forty-thousandth of the earth\u2019s circumference. It is actually one-forty-millionth.]\n\nFollow our updates on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Does Pelosi have the votes to become Speaker? - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Does Pelosi have the votes to become Speaker?

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren is sounding the alarm about a danger she says could set off another financial crisis if regulators don't police it.\n\nThe pileup of lending to companies that are carrying high debt loads poses a gathering threat to the economy, the Massachusetts Democrat and likely 2020 presidential contender argued in a Thursday hearing and in letters to regulators. The problem, as she sees it, is that underwriting standards for the loans have grown too loose in a market that tops $1 trillion, much as they did for subprime mortgages before the meltdown a decade ago.\n\n\u201cI'm not sure that I see much distinction between what you're doing now and the Fed was doing pre-2008, and I think that's deeply worrisome,\u201d Warren told Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve\u2019s vice chairman for supervision, at a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \u201cI'm very concerned that the Fed dropped the ball before and may be dropping it one more time on this.\u201d\n\nQuarles said the volume of the loans isn\u2019t as relevant as \u201cthe structures that these loans are being held in,\u201d and the central bank is \u201clooking very closely\u201d at the matter. But he resisted Warren\u2019s suggestion that the Fed should come down harder on those making the loans, as they did as recently as five years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s not a rule,\u201d he said. \u201cTo enforce guidance is inappropriate.\u201d Instead, he said, the Fed is holding banks \u201cto standards of safety and soundness.\u201d\n\nWarren, as she noted, is not alone in her rising concern.\n\nAmong others, Former Fed chair Janet Yellen recently argued the United States needs to confront a \u201chuge deterioration\u201d in corporate lending standards, especially to firms with weaker credit ratings. \u201cI am worried about the systemic risks associated with these loans,\u201d Yellen told the Financial Times in a recent interview. Yellen said the lessons of the last crash could be lost as banks push to roll back the rules that followed it. \u201cThere are a lot of weaknesses in the system, and instead of looking to remedy those weaknesses I feel things have turned in a very deregulatory direction.\u201d\n\nFormer Fed chair Janet Yellen. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nIn an earlier interview with Bloomberg, she called on regulators to speak out. \u201cThey should make it clear to the public and the Congress there are things they are concerned about and they don\u2019t have the tools to fix it,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd the phenomenon drew a warning from Todd Vermilyea, the Fed\u2019s head of risk surveillance and data. He told bankers at a recent conference in New York their lending looks increasingly dangerous. \u201cThere may be a material loosening of terms and weaknesses in risk management,\u201d he said. \u201cSome institutions could be taking on risk without the appropriate mitigating controls.\u201d But Quarles\u2019s comments Thursday, from higher up the Fed's org chart, indicate the central bank won\u2019t be coordinating a crackdown.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s broader deregulatory push has accelerated the development. As Bloomberg explained last month:\n\n\u201cOn leveraged lending, the industry got an assist last year when regulators had to step back from the 2013 guidelines, which had driven a number of transactions to nonbank lenders. At the prodding of Republicans in Congress, the Government Accountability Office reviewed the guidance and determined that the Fed and other agencies had overstepped their authority and needed congressional approval for it to be a rule. \u201cFollowing the decision, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting said banks could do as much leveraged lending as they wanted provided they had sufficient capital to offset the risks, and it doesn\u2019t impair their soundness. Just last week, Otting said the banking industry had \u2018really kind of stayed on the rails\u2019 and that private-equity firms were doing the riskiest leveraged lending.\u201d\n\nSo far, defaults on the loans remain minimal \u2014 a testament to the ease with which the companies that have taken them are keeping up with their payments amid humming economic conditions. The picture could change if the economy hits a skid. Or, per hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, rising interest rates could do the trick. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stress test our whole corporate credit market for the first time,\u201d Jones said Thursday at the Greenwich Economic Forum. \u201cFrom a markets perspective, it\u2019s going to be interesting. There probably will be some really scary moments in corporate credit.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the hearing, Warren also laid out her case in a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Jelena McWilliams, and Otting \u2014 and asked for responses by Dec. 11.\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\nSpecialist Dilip Patel, left, works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 8.

WSJ's Riva Gold and Jessica Menton: \"U.S. stocks bounced back Thursday as technology shares staged a rebound, helping the S&P 500 snap a five-session losing streak. Thursday\u2019s session marked another volatile day on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average swinging more than 550 points from its high to its low. Major indexes appeared to get a boost after the Financial Times reported that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports has been put on hold.\"\n\nThis year's volatility just hit a benchmark, LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick noted:\n\nThere it is.

WSJ's Harriet Torry: \u201cEconomists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were roughly split on whether the outcome of the recent midterm elections would dispel or increase uncertainty for the economy and financial markets in the coming months. . . . Nearly half of respondents in the economists\u2019 survey, 46%, said economic uncertainty would increase somewhat following the midterms, while 40% of respondents expected it would decline somewhat after the vote... Half of economists expected the next recession to start in 2020... One point economists appeared to agree on is they expected the labor market to remain strong.\u201d\n\nInvestors have had nowhere to hide. The Associated Press's Stan Choe: \u201cEven the most balanced investors have gotten knocked on their heels this year. Typically, spreading one\u2019s bets across several different types of investments has helped deliver steadier returns. When U.S. stocks slide, say, bonds and gold can hopefully help offset the losses. Or maybe stocks abroad will hold up better than their U.S. counterparts. Not so this year. U.S. stocks have endured some breathtaking drops the last several weeks, slicing the S&P 500\u2032s year-to-date return to 2.2 percent after including dividends . . . The investments that are supposed to offer safer returns have also struggled at the same time. It\u2019s a rude reminder that one of the bedrock tenets of investing \u2014 don\u2019t keep too much of your portfolio concentrated in any one thing \u2014 doesn\u2019t guarantee success by itself. But it\u2019s also important to remember that this year\u2019s struggles have been a relative anomaly.\u201d\n\nJerome Powell. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)\n\n\u2014 Powell: Fed could pause rate hikes. Bloomberg's Rich Miller: \"Powell has laid out a scenario for a pause in the central bank\u2019s interest-rate hiking campaign sometime next year by highlighting potential headwinds to the U.S. economy. While generally upbeat about the outlook, Powell on Wednesday listed three possible challenges to growth in 2019: slowing demand abroad, fading fiscal stimulus at home and the lagged economic impact of the Fed\u2019s past rate increases. 'These are things we are well aware of,\u2019' he said in an appearance at the Dallas Fed.\n\nAlso Powell: Fed knows some people are struggling. NYT's Binyamin Appelbaum, reporting from Houston: \"Powell walked the streets of a struggling neighborhood in this otherwise prospering city on Thursday before meeting with community leaders in a visit intended to demonstrate the Fed\u2019s concern about those who have been left behind by a decade of economic growth. Mr. Powell\u2026 delivered his standard upbeat message about the health of the broader economy, but he added, \u2018I want you to know that we are well aware and very focused on the fact that there are some people who are outside of that.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe steady expansion of the American economy has driven the stock market to record heights and dropped the unemployment rate to 3.7 percent, the lowest level in a half-century. But the gains are uneven. The wealthy have prospered while median wages have only recently started to rise at a stronger pace, and millions of adults, especially younger men, have dropped out of the work force. As is often the case, minority communities have seen the smallest gains.\u201d\n\nThe central bank will review itself. CNBC's Jeff Cox: \u201cThe Federal Reserve in 2019 will launch a broad look at how it conducts policy and conveys what it is doing to the public. Central bank officials announced Thursday that they will look at \u2018strategies, tools, and communication practices\u2019 the Fed uses to formulate monetary policy. Such a review has been a topic of discussion at recent Federal Open Market Committee meetings. \u2018With labor market conditions close to maximum employment and inflation near our 2 percent objective, now is a good time to take stock of how we formulate, conduct, and communicate monetary policy,\u2019 Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a statement.\u201d\n\nEurope May vows to see Brexit through, despite wave of resignations and party acrimony The prime minister was on the defensive in a day that began with the resignation of her Brexit minister.

Negotiators stepped up efforts after [Trump], and Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, spoke on the phone on November 1 and agreed to discuss trade when they meet on the G20 sidelines... Following the call, China responded to US requests to address a range of sticking points, and the possibility of concessions was discussed in several telephone negotiations between senior officials in Beijing and Washington... One person familiar with the situation said [Lighthizer] had told some industry executives the next tranche of levies was already on hold. A spokesman for the trade representative said: 'Ambassador Lighthizer has made no representations to industry executives that future Section 301 tariffs are on hold... Any reports to the contrary are incorrect.'\"\n\nRoss: Don't expect a major breakthrough. Bloomberg: \"The U.S. still plans to raise tariffs on Chinese imports in January with [Trump] and China\u2019s Xi Jinping likely at best to agree to a \u201cframework\u201d for further talks to resolve trade tensions at an upcoming meeting, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said... When asked about a report that China this week had presented a list of possible concessions ahead of the talks, Ross said in an interview Thursday that everything leading up to the meeting is just 'preparatory.'\"\n\n(Meanwhile, Politico reports that Ross could be out of a job as part of a broader cabinet shake-up as soon as January, with budget director Mick Mulvaney talking up his interest in replacing him.)\n\nAutomaker groups warn U.S. tariffs will undermine new NAFTA deal U.S. automakers and parts suppliers on Thursday warned that Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs and threatened car tariffs would undermine the benefits of the new deal to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, causing widespread job losses.

NYT's Cecilia Kang and co.: \"On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, held a conference call with reporters to discuss how the social network manages problematic posts and its community standards. The call quickly went sideways. For more than an hour, the 34-year-old billionaire instead fielded questions about how he and his No. 2, Sheryl Sandberg, obfuscated problems such as Russian interference on Facebook and how the company had gone on the attack against rivals and critics. In response, Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 at times defiant and at times conciliatory \u2014 defended the social network, Ms. Sandberg and his own record. 'The reality of running a company of more than 10,000 people is that you\u2019re not going to know everything that\u2019s going on,' he said at one point.\n\n\"Yet even as Mr. Zuckerberg was making his case, a furor against his company was gathering momentum. In Washington, Republicans and Democrats threatened to restrain Facebook through competition laws and to open investigations into possible campaign finance violations. Shareholders ramped up calls to oust Mr. Zuckerberg as Facebook\u2019s chairman.

Bill Nelson was left with almost no chance of pulling off a comeback to retain his seat Friday after Florida\u2019s two largest counties completed hand recounts that failed to generate the big vote bump the incumbent Democrat needed.\n\nNelson\u2019s underwhelming performances in the recounts in \u00adMiami-Dade County and the Democratic stronghold of Broward County, along with three courtroom setbacks, make it almost impossible for the three-term senator and former astronaut to overcome a deficit of more than 12,000 votes in his reelection bid against Gov. Rick Scott (R). The recounts set the stage for a likely Scott victory that would strengthen Republican control of the U.S. Senate and give the nation\u2019s third-most-populous state two GOP senators. Unless something unforeseen occurs, Democratic insiders expect Nelson to concede as early as this weekend ahead of the results being certified Tuesday.\n\nElection officials in Palm Beach County were not expected to release their recount tallies until Sunday.\n\nIn Miami-Dade County, Nelson gained only 181 votes in the manual recount, according to a spokesman for the county\u2019s elections office. But the results in heavily Democratic Broward, just to the north, were even more damaging.\n\nBroward officials reported Friday that they had recorded more than 30,000 \u201cundervote\u201d ballots, in which no candidate appeared to be selected. Going into the manual recount, Nelson\u2019s campaign had hoped that large numbers of ballots with no recorded vote in the Senate race would be revealed as votes for the Democrat once they were examined by hand. But that did not occur.\n\nEarly Saturday afternoon, Broward County canvassing board attorney Rene Harrod confirmed to The Post official numbers from the county\u2019s manual recount in the Senate race: Of more than 32,000 ballots that were recounted, Nelson gained 410 votes and Scott gained 136 votes.\n\n\n\nElection workers and observers count votes at the Broward County Supervisor of Elections headquarters in Lauderhill, Fla., on Friday. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nAs Nelson\u2019s campaign was receiving the results in Broward and Miami-Dade, it was also absorbing losses in three lawsuits filed by Democrats and voting rights advocates that could have benefited his campaign. Democrats lost what may have been Nelson\u2019s final legal recourse Friday with a federal judge\u2019s decision denying a request to accept some mail-in ballots received after Election Day.\n\nJacob Sanders, a Democratic consultant in St. Lucie County, said there was little question the election was over. The Nelson campaign\u2019s push to hang on only delayed the reckoning due in a race that he says Democrats should have won.\n\n\u201cPeople are not happy that the blue wave hit the rest of the country and missed Florida. People are looking around and saying, \u2018What happened?\u2019 \u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe recount was a really good way to make people stop asking. There\u2019s going to be a reckoning now.\u201d\n\nThe hand recount followed an error-ridden statewide machine recount that appears to have settled Florida\u2019s closely watched gubernatorial race, with President Trump\u2019s favored candidate, Ron DeSantis (R), retaining his lead over Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D). However, the first recount yielded no definitive result in the Senate race, in which the candidates were separated by less than the 0.25 percent that would have averted a hand recount.\n\nIn key counties Friday, manual recounts were finished with startling speed. Broward, which had stumbled through the machine recount, rolled through the state-mandated hand recount in just two hours Friday morning with only minimal arguments from party lawyers and no major controversies. The recount was completed so quickly that workers were sent home before lunch.\n\n\n\nA crowd gathers outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections headquarters Friday. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nJoe D\u2019Alessandro, the elections director for Broward, described the county\u2019s 30,000-plus undervotes as typical. However, Broward accounted for nearly half the state\u2019s total in the Senate race. And the figure was higher than the 21,969 undervotes in the lower-profile agriculture commissioner race on the same ballot.\n\nAllies of Nelson complained about the ballot design in Broward County because the Senate race was placed below a set of instructions and might not have been noticed by some voters.\n\nBroward election officials were under extreme pressure Friday after their botched handling of the machine recount the day before. The county\u2019s machine-based tally was rejected by Florida\u2019s secretary of state because it was submitted two minutes past a 3 p.m. deadline. The tardy submission meant Broward\u2019s original vote count was used.\n\nIn Broward on Friday, election workers and observers gathered at 6 a.m. and were given gloves for the delicate job of handling paper ballots.\n\nThe canvassing board had to wrestle with ballots that had inked-in bubbles next to both Nelson\u2019s and Scott\u2019s names, ballots with tiny flecks of ink called \u201cpen rests,\u201d and a ballot that had a bubble filled in but also had an X over the bubble.\n\n\n\nBrenda Snipes, third from the left, the Broward County election supervisor, prepares to distribute ballots to elections workers and observers Friday. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nQuestionable ballots are projected for review in Lauderhill. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nScores of ballot counters wait for the start of the recount Friday. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nOne particularly curious ballot had the bubble next to Nelson\u2019s name filled in, but also listed a write-in candidate named \u201cRick Nelson.\u201d The Broward canvassing judges decided that one should count for Nelson, even though it seemed to conflate the Democrat\u2019s last name with the Republican\u2019s first name. They applied a concept called the \u201crule of consistency,\u201d noting that the same voter had also filled in the bubble next to gubernatorial candidate Gillum\u2019s name while also listing Gillum as a write-in candidate.\n\nThe manual recount will also probably determine the outcome in Florida\u2019s agriculture commissioner race, a contest that has drawn widespread attention because it pits two politicians considered rising stars: Nikki Fried, a Democratic medical-marijuana advocate, and Republican Matt Caldwell . Entering Friday\u2019s recount, Fried led by 5,307 votes.\n\n\n\nJoe D\u2019Alessandro, of the Broward County Supervisor of Elections Office, answers questions from the media after completing the manual recount Friday. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nA federal judge in Tallahassee ruled late Thursday against Democratic efforts to change Florida\u2019s recounting rules. The suit, filed by Nelson and national Democratic leaders, sought to lift two rules that dictate when unclear ballot markings may be counted.\n\nJudge Mark Walker of the U.S. District Court in Tallahassee also ruled late Thursday against the League of Women Voters, which had sued to force Scott to recuse himself from overseeing the state\u2019s administration of the election in his official capacity as governor. However, Walker also dinged Scott for \u201ctoeing the line\u201d between \u201cimprudent campaign-trail rhetoric\u201d and \u201cproblematic state action.\u201d\n\nSince the recount was ordered last Saturday, protesters have been a constant presence outside Broward\u2019s suburban vote center, where longtime elections supervisor Brenda C. Snipes has been the object of frequent criticism from Republicans. In Palm Beach County, the scene has been more placid, with Republicans and Democrats arrayed in circles of camping chairs. One Republican arrived with his golf clubs.\n\nThey\u2019ve been through this before, of course. During the 2000 presidential election, Palm Beach was one of the focal points of the Bush vs. Gore recount battles. It was disparaged for its poorly designed \u201cbutterfly ballot,\u201d which some said led them to cast votes for the wrong candidate. Now the talk in the county is all about machines that should have worked \u2014 but didn\u2019t.\n\nGardner reported from Fort Lauderdale.

In 17 years as a head coach, his record is 183-32, including 79-9 at Ohio State. That\u2019s an .851 winning percentage, better than Nick Saban or Bobby Bowden, the best in major college football since Frank Leahy finished coaching at Notre Dame \u2014 in 1953.\n\nDJ Durkin is no longer the football coach at Maryland, so who knows where he will be when his former players host the Buckeyes on senior day at Maryland Stadium? In two years as a head coach, both with the Terrapins, his record was 10-15. That\u2019s a .400 winning percentage. Win that percentage of your games over a long enough time, and you\u2019re dime-a-dozen expendable. Flip through the catalogue and find someone else.\n\nOne of those coaches can step on land mines \u2014 even some of his own creation \u2014 and still keep his job, and one can\u2019t. No two programs nationally have endured more tumultuous 2018 seasons than Maryland and Ohio State. But if we\u2019re honest, we know this much is true: If DJ Durkin had been 79-9, he would be coaching Maryland against Ohio State this weekend. If Urban Meyer were 10-15, he would be watching from home while trying to spruce up his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nThe fates of the coaches in each place cut to an obvious but undeniable truism in big-time college athletics: Winning is more important than the culture you create for your kids or the quality of the men you hire to coach them. Winning is a mask and a deodorant. Winning is the ultimate survival aid, the life preserver coaches who have committed egregious errors can cling to.\n\n[College football betting Week 12: Fade SEC teams during their annual November siestas?]\n\nIf you win, you can harbor a domestic abuser on your staff and lie publicly about it. That\u2019s what Meyer did over the summer. For the record, he says he \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and didn\u2019t lie, but he\u2019s splitting hairs, and he knows it. On July 24, he told reporters at Big Ten media days that there was \u201cnothing\u201d to a report about a 2015 domestic violence allegation against Buckeyes receivers coach Zach Smith, whom Meyer had fired the day before.\n\nThere\u2019s wasn\u2019t \u201cnothing\u201d there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who creates a story like that,\u201d Meyer said, condescendingly, trying to dismiss the report on a technicality when he was aware that Smith\u2019s ex-wife had reported years of abuse to police in suburban Columbus \u2014 reports that did not lead to Smith\u2019s arrest but did exist. It\u2019s not nothing.\n\nIn August, Ohio State trustees met for 10 hours while deciding, ultimately, that Meyer should be suspended for three games. Hanging over that entire meeting: Guys, he\u2019s winning 90 percent of his games here.\n\nDomestic violence is as serious an issue as a coach, who is supposed to be a role model for his players, can confront. Unless, of course, a player dies on a coach\u2019s watch. That, of course, was Durkin\u2019s situation.\n\nDurkin\u2019s first job in coaching was as a graduate assistant on Meyer\u2019s staff at Bowling Green in 2001. He worked for Meyer again in 2010 at Florida. He had to learn something from him, right?\n\nWhen Durkin got his head coaching chance at Maryland, he found himself in Meyer\u2019s division in the Big Ten. In trying to chase Meyer the coach and Ohio State the program, Durkin worked to create a culture that blindly pushed players past what they were capable of. In that culture, Jordan McNair died.\n\n[Maryland hires search firm for next football coach; AD says, \u2018I\u2019ve started my work\u2019]\n\nIn October, when the University of Maryland System Board of Regents evaluated a report it had ordered about that culture, it initially \u2014 and ridiculously \u2014 reinstated Durkin. Do you remember those 24 hours, spanning Oct. 30-31, before Wallace D. Loh, the president of the flagship College Park campus, dismissed Durkin? One thing I heard over and over during that day: They\u2019re going to fight to keep this guy?\n\nTranslation: He\u2019s 10-15. Interim coach Matt Canada, at that point, had the Terps at 5-3. Is DJ Durkin worth defending?\n\nFor the foreseeable future, Maryland\u2019s program is wounded by McNair\u2019s death and the revelations about Durkin\u2019s operation that followed. That seems inescapable, not just for Canada and the kids he\u2019s trying to lead but for whoever is hired for the job permanently. It will take time, lots of time, and a whole new cast of characters to get the Terrapins beyond the fact that a kid collapsed during a workout, wasn\u2019t properly helped and died a preventable death. It\u2019s still sad and staggering to comprehend.\n\nBut at Ohio State, the biggest issue is . . . what? Depth along the offensive line? Quarterback Dwayne Haskins\u2019s return to Maryland, where he attended Bullis in Potomac? Discontent among a fan base with the highest expectations about a 9-1 record and next week\u2019s Armageddon game against rival Michigan? Yeah, sure, there\u2019s the recent swirl about an unsubstantiated report about sketchy circumstances surrounding Smith and a former Buckeye\u2019s transfer to Florida. But for the most part, since Meyer returned to coach in September, it has been football.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about everything,\u201d Meyer said this week. \u201cThat\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\nConsider, though, why Meyer even has that job. The controversies that enveloped Maryland and Ohio State this season sprang from wholly different circumstances, and at some level, it\u2019s unfair to compare them. What\u2019s not unfair to conclude: Winning makes loose morals and truth-bending permissible. Losing simply makes justice more convenient.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article mistated Durkin\u2019s record. Durkin\u2019s record at Maryland is 10-15 and his overall record is 11-15, including a win as interim head coach at Florida.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Wiley Miller", "title": "Non Sequitur for Friday, November 16, 2018", "description": "Comics - Washington Post comics, Tom Toles, Cul de Sac and editorial cartoons.

Bernie Sanders was set to address a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d rally in downtown Columbia, S.C. on Saturday, Oct. 20, 2018. (AP Photo/Meg Kinnard).\n\nHealth care is expected to be a major pressure point between the incoming class of House Democratic freshmen and their leadership.\n\nDuring the 2018 campaign, about two-thirds of the incoming House Democratic class supported a big change to the U.S. health care system in the form of a \"Medicare-for-all\" program; a Medicare buy-in option for all; or an expansion of Social Security, according to the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Specifically looking at Medicare-for-all, the PCCC says 26 out of 60 incoming Democrats from races that have been called so far supported such a policy. That means they back a system in which all health-care bills are paid for by one entity -- in this case, the federal government.\n\nAnd those Democrats intend to bring their rhetoric from the campaign trail to Congress.\n\nRep.-elect Rashida Tlaib (D) of Michigan told me she\u2019s \u201cvery much\u201d committed to pushing Medicare-for-all going forward. \u201cFor many members, [health care] is the priority issue.\u201d\n\nOne problem for them may be that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her deputies have said they would first work on improving the Affordable Care Act rather than embracing a single-payer health plan.\n\nPelosi is currently embroiled in a pitched battle to regain the House speakership that has exposed rifts between the old Democratic guard and newer members, some of whom campaigned on progressive priorities like health care.\n\nA group of 17 Democratic members, led by Rep. Seth Moulton (Mass.), have said they won\u2019t support her bid to retake the speaker's gavel, my colleagues have reported. At least one member \u2014 Rep. Marcia L. Fudge of Ohio \u2014 has emerged as a potential competitor. For her part, Pelosi declared Thursday that she has \u201coverwhelming support in my caucus to be speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nAnd Democrats have said that, at this point, health care is not one of the issues that is cleaving their caucus in the leadership battle.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said it would be something the Medicare for All Caucus, which she co-founded, would tackle once the new majority is settled in January. And they'll have plenty of opposition from the right. President Trump and others in the Republican Party repeatedly attacked Democrats on the issue in the campaign, with President Trump saying Democrats \"want to raid Medicare to pay for socialism.\"\n\n\u201cWe created the Medicare for All Caucus to really be able to sit down with members, help educate them on what this would look like, get comfortable with the research and some of the concerns they hear, some of the attacks they\u2019re going to get,\u201d Jayapal told me. \u201cSo we\u2019ll work through that process, and I feel good about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pushing really hard in all kinds of ways with the Medicare for All [political action committee] outside, and also with the Medicare for All Caucus.\u201d\n\nIt's time for action on #MedicareforAll! I am going to be pushing for hearings and to have this debate on the floor of the House of Representatives. https://t.co/Iep4TIcu25 \u2014 Rep. Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) November 15, 2018\n\nOur @USProgressives agenda is a new kind of centrism, based on policy priorities that serve the center of our country.

Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) November 14, 2018\n\nHow to approach health care is likely to be a problem for whoever assumes the speakership. Supporters of a single-payer system are already agitating and pushing a national strategy. Jayapal has taken the lead on the House\u2019s single-payer bill, the Expanded & Improved Medicare for All Act. She, along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and leaders of National Nurses United, held a call with supporters this week to urge a widespread effort to push the policy forward.\n\n\u201cWhen we have that majority, we need to make sure that we put it to use,\u201d Jayapal said during the call.\n\nFor his part, PCCC co-founder Adam Green said that voters care about making changes to health care. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of incoming freshman Democrats ran on Elizabeth Warren-style, economic populist issues, which shows that voters want to see boldness from House Democrats \u2014 not small-bore, technocratic thinking,\u201d Green said.\n\nSpeaking generally about some of the incoming Democrats, Jayapal, vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters Thursday a priority was largely in \u201cmaking sure they can go back to the people who elected them who want to see the caucus reflective of a progressive majority that really helped drive these races.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think members just want to be able to go back and say we feel really good that progressives are going to have a real say in the direction of policy in this next session,\u201d she said.\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\n(iStock)\n\nAHH: The Food and Drug Administration launched a sweeping effort to combat the rising rate of youth vaping and smoking, with new restrictions on sales of flavored e-cigarettes and a plan to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.\n\n\u201cThe FDA says it will limit sales of many flavored e-cigarettes to bricks-and-mortar outlets that have either age-restricted entry or areas inside stores that are not accessible to people under 18,\u201d my Post colleagues Laurie McGinley and Lenny Bernstein report. \u201cThe agency also will require stepped-up age verification for online sales.\u201d\n\nMcGinley first reported last week the plan from the FDA to crack down on e-cigarette products. The Health 202\u2019s Paige Winfield Cunningham wrote this week that FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb defended the agency\u2019s actions despite criticism from conservatives.\n\nThe new restrictions from the FDA reflect concerns about how the electronic products can serve as a gateway to nicotine addiction, McGinley and Bernstein report. Even more notable are the potential restrictions on cigarettes and cigars. \u201cSuch prohibitions will require new regulations that could take years to go into effect and could be derailed by opposition from the cigarette industry,\u201d my colleagues write. \u201cIf successful, though, the bans could have an especially large impact on African American adults and youth, who smoke menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars at higher rates than other groups.\u201d\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R), center, speaks during a news conference Sept. 12 at the State Capitol in Little Rock, Ark., about the state's work requirement for its expanded Medicaid program. (Andrew DeMillo/AP)\n\nOOF: In the last three months, more than 12,000 people have lost their Medicaid coverage in Arkansas because they failed to comply with the state's new work requirements.\n\nAccording to data released by the state, more than 3,800 beneficiaries lost coverage in just the last month. The rule requires beneficiaries to work 80 hours a month or lose coverage if they don\u2019t meet that standard for three months out of the year.\n\n\u201cThe agency said another 6,000 people will lose coverage if they don\u2019t meet the work requirement by the end of this month,\u201d the Associated Press\u2019s Andrew DeMillo reports. \u201cArkansas was the first state to enforce the requirement after the Trump administration allowed states to tie Medicaid coverage to work. The requirement is being challenged in federal court, and a federal advisory panel last week urged the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to temporarily stop Arkansas from enforcing the rule.\u201d\n\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention logo at the agency's headquarters in Atlanta.

(Manuel Gomez, File/Associated Press)\n\nMILAN \u2014 AC Milan is preparing for another hearing before UEFA\u2019s club finance panel next week.\n\nIn July, the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned a ban imposed on the seven-time European champions for overspending.\n\nCAS said the one-year exclusion from European competition was too harsh considering Milan\u2019s recent takeover by U.S.-based hedge fund Elliott Management.\n\n\u201cThey do not have a very difficult task,\u201d Milan executive chairman Paolo Scaroni told the Gazzetta dello Sport. \u201cBoth parties agree on the fact that in the period between 2014 and 2017 the club infringed the limits of FFP. They must only establish a proportionate sanction.\u201d\n\nPossible new sanctions include limits on player salaries, transfer spending, squad sizes in the Champions League or Europa League and large suspended fines.\n\nWhen it was initially banned in June, Milan said it failed to break even on soccer-related business in the period from July 2014-June 2017 \u2014 before its 2017 spending spree.\n\nFor 2017-18, Milan spent more than 200 million euros (then nearly $250 million) on new players. That was despite questions over the financial stability of the Chinese-led consortium that purchased the club from former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for $800 million in April 2017.\n\nElliott took control of Milan in June after former owner Li Yonghong missed a deadline to repay part of a loan worth more than 300 million euros ($350 million) from the hedge fund. Elliott repossessed the holding company in Luxembourg that Li used to buy Milan.\n\nScaroni rejected reports that Elliott was seeking a new minority shareholder.\n\n\u201cThere are no negotiations \u2014 zero \u2014 no shareholder in sight nor we are looking for it,\u201d Scaroni said in an interview published Friday. \u201cElliott has a broad design to be implemented in three-five years. Firstly, it must create value to eventually disinvest one day.\u201d\n\nWhile Milan is currently in fifth place in Serie A, one spot \u2014 and one point \u2014 below the Champions League places, Scaroni said that qualifying for the lucrative competition would not be decisive financially.\n\n\u201cIn all the papers relevant to this year\u2019s business plan we do not foresee the qualification in the Champions League,\u201d Scaroni said. \u201cNext year, we do. We would need a Plan B if we fail.\u201d\n\nMilan hasn\u2019t played in the Champions League since the 2013-14 season.\n\nNext month, former Arsenal CEO Ivan Gazidis will assume the same position at Milan.\n\n\u201cHe will manage the engine: I will take a step back,\u201d Scaroni said. \u201cAC Milan has the vital problem of increasing revenues, which today are the same as in 2003 against double or triple expenses to pay players. Since there is no longer a patron who covers the expenses, we need another philosophy and Gazidis has already been down this road with Arsenal.\u201d\n\nLast week, Milan and city rival Inter agreed to work on a shared stadium project, announcing a preference for \u201ccomplete renovation\u201d of their city-owned San Siro home.\n\nScaroni called the stadium plan \u201ca way to halve investments and maintenance and at the same time to double the value of the sponsors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stadium increases the revenues by 40-50 million euros and a big sponsor could purchase naming rights,\u201d Scaroni said. \u201cWe will have international companies queuing to make the investment. And we would cash a lot more than the Allianz Stadium (Juventus\u2019 home) in Turin.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Peter Dejong/Associated Press)\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 As Dutch children anticipate the arrival of their country\u2019s version of Santa Claus this weekend, critics and fans of his helper, Black Pete, are gearing up for protests that have become another fixture of the festive season in the Netherlands.\n\nWhite people often daub their faces with black paint when they dress up to play the character. Opponents say the annual recreations of Black Pete promote racist stereotypes. Supporters defend the sidekick of Sinterklaas, the white-bearded, red-robed Dutch version of St. Nicholas, as a traditional children\u2019s character.\n\nA nationally televised arrival parade takes place Saturday in the picturesque village of Zaandijk, north of Amsterdam. Sinterklaas and his helpers are set to arrive on a boat and then tour the village. One group unsuccessfully tried in court to keep Pete from the party.\n\nGeralt Lammers, a spokesman for Zaandam municipality, which includes Zaandijk, said four groups, two in favor and two against Black Pete, have said they plan demonstrations.\n\nThe municipality has assigned specific areas for the protests to avoid possible confrontations between the pro- and anti-Pete camps.\n\nThe most prominent group, Kick Out Black Pete, said on its Facebook page that it is organizing weekend demonstrations in 18 Dutch municipalities, but not in Zaandijk.\n\nThe far-right Netherlands People\u2019s Union is one of the groups planning to demonstrate in support of the Christmas character.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte entered the debate Friday, calling on all protesters not to spoil the festivities for children.\n\n\u201cI think society agrees on one thing: we grant children the magic of the Sinterklaas party,\u201d Rutte said at his weekly press conference.\n\nNTR, the public broadcaster responsible for the televised event, said the Black Petes in this year\u2019s parade will have faces made up in various shades. In recent years, the color of the character\u2019s face has been attributed to smudges of soot from going up and down chimneys to deliver gifts.\n\n\u201cThe more often a Pete has been through a chimney, the more soot he or she has on their face,\u201d NTR said in a statement earlier this year.\n\nAnti-Pete protesters took their arguments to court this week, arguing the character was racist and discriminatory. Afro-style wigs are part of some costumes as well as blackface makeup, though fewer than in past years.\n\nBut a judge refused the request to keep Black Pete out of the parade.\n\n\u201cBlack Pete is undoubtedly changing,\u201d judge Antoon Schotman said. \u201cSome think that the process is moving too slowly and that\u2019s fine. Others believe the process is moving too quickly. There is no objective way of measuring it. What is important is that the conversation continues.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Haidar Mohammed Ali/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIran\u2019s once-indomitable influence in Iraq is waning, new public opinion data shows. The rise of Iranian influence can be traced to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Iran filled a political vacuum left after the fall of Saddam Hussein in ways the United States could not, cultivating a wide range of Iraqi proxies and constituencies.\n\nIran\u2019s popularity increased significantly in Iraq from 2003 until 2014. Iran\u2019s strategy was to exploit Iraq\u2019s sectarian divide, using Shiite parties to increase its influence not only among the political elite but also among average Iraqi Shiites. Sectarian religious propaganda was one of the main tools used by Iran to increase its popularity and hence influence among Iraqis.\n\nBut while many analysts treat Iran\u2019s influence in Iraq as something akin to a natural fact, new public opinion survey evidence shows that Iran\u2019s honeymoon with Iraqi Shiites is rapidly fading. This shift in attitudes could have profound effects on the future trajectory of Iraqi politics.\n\nNew attitudes toward Iran\n\nRecent data from surveys conducted by my research group, Alustakilla (IIACSS), shows new trends in public opinion about Iran among Iraqi Shiites. These surveys are based on nationwide representative samples of 2,500 to 3,500 face-to-face interviews conducted two to three times annually during the past decade.\n\nThe findings from recent surveys reveal genuinely striking changes. The percentage of Iraqi Shiites who have favorable attitudes toward Iran decreased from 88 percent in 2015 to 47 percent in the fall of 2018. During the same period, those who have unfavorable attitudes toward Iran increased from 6 percent to 51 percent. This means that the majority of Iraqi Shiites currently have negative attitudes toward Iran.\n\nAt the same time, the percentage of Shiites who believe that Iran is a reliable partner in Iraq has decreased sharply, from 76 percent to 43 percent, over the same period. Those who believe that Iran is not a reliable partner increased from 24 percent to 55 percent. There is a significant increase in the percentage of Iraqi Shiites who believe that Iran is a real threat to Iraqi sovereignty. This number has jumped from 25 percent in 2016 to 58 percent in 2018.\n\nThe same trend among Sunni Iraqis\u2019 public opinion toward Islamic fundamentalists could be seen in my surveys over the past four years. Because of the barbarism of the Islamic State occupation in Sunni areas of Iraq, it is not surprising the Sunnis in Iraq have soured on Sunni Islamist fundamentalism. The new survey leaves no doubt that Iraqi Shiites are showing the same trend toward Iran.\n\nWhy have Iraqi Shiites turned against Iran?\n\nIraqi Shiites hold Iran responsible for their misery on three levels: political, economic and social. On the political level, Shiites regard Iran as the main supporter for all Iraqi governments since 2006. These governments, which have been controlled by Shiite Islamic parties, had the full support of Iran \u2014 and yet failed to deliver a decent standard of living for Iraqis in general and in the Shiite areas in particular. This has driven a remarkable wave of protests over the past year in Iraq\u2019s south.\n\nThe role of Iran in composing the new Iraqi government was very clear to the public. On an economic level, Iran has used Iraq as a way to bypass economic sanctions. It dumped goods in the Iraqi market \u2014 especially in Shiite areas, which are close to Iraq\u2019s borders \u2014 that were very cheap and of low quality. This practice negatively affected the local economy, destroying small and medium Iraqi industrial and agricultural producers. For instance, the largest petrochemical complex \u2014 and thousands of tomato farms in Basra \u2014 stopped their production due to this unfair competition.\n\nIran also receives blame for the water problems that have plagued Basra and southern Iraq. Due to water supply and electricity production shortages in Iran, the Iranian government had to cut the flow of rivers that provided clean water to Iraq. This resulted in a large shortage in drinkable water in southern Iraq, which is predominantly Shiite.\n\nAll these factors resulted in large protests in the Shiite south, especially in Basra. Protesters hold Iran responsible \u2014 and even burned its consulate in Basra.\n\nHow this matters for Iraqi politics\n\nThere is little reason to believe that Iran will lose all influence or appeal inside Iraq. It retains a wide range of allies and proxies, including the Popular Mobilization Forces and leading political parties.\n\nStill, the popular Iraqi Shiite disillusionment with Iran shows that the polarization of Iraqi attitudes toward Iran or Arab Sunni countries is vanishing. This leaves more space for nonsectarian national politics, which can help Iraq move forward, focusing on national reconciliation.\n\nMunqith M.

You won\u2019t want to miss our daily analysis on the complex relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley, coming to your inbox in December.\n\nTHE KEY\n\nChristopher Krebs, undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security's National Protection and Programs Directorate, speaks during a news conference in Arlington, Va., on Oct. 19. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security plans to apply the lessons it learned from the 2018 midterm elections on cybersecurity to other critical infrastructure, and will be helped by the imminent elevation of its responsibility for civilian cybersecurity throughout the government.\n\n\u201cThat serves as a model for how we\u2019re going to partner to protect the grid, to protect the banks,\u201d DHS cybersecurity chief Chris Krebs told private industry leaders on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a significant amount of progress, and going forward we have to look to how we can replicate those sorts of engagements.\u201d\n\nKrebs\u2019s comments come as he is expected to take over as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency [CISA]. Congress passed a bill earlier this week that will create the new unit within DHS \u2014 which will cement the agency's leadership on civilian cybersecurity and rank on the same level within the department as the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Secret Service. President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law as early as Friday.\n\nThe new agency will elevate the cybersecurity mission within DHS, Krebs said, and it will be responsible for coordinating with other government entities and the private sector on cybersecurity and critical infrastructure programs. The legislation is intended to make it easier for the private sector to work with government on cybersecurity threats. DHS's cybersecurity work is currently housed under the National Protection and Programs Directorate. Krebs told the Cybersecurity 202 earlier this year that the unit needed to be rebranded to reflect what it actually does.\n\n\"It was one of my top priorities since I came to DHS,\" Krebs told me in an interview yesterday.\n\nKrebs\u2019s remarks came at a meeting with members of the Charter of Trust, an initiative including global companies such as Siemens and IBM. DHS also hosted the first supply-chain security task force uniting government entities with technology and communications companies.\n\nCISA is the result of a long-fought battle to consolidate DHS\u2019s authority on cybersecurity matters. An effort to create such an agency has been underway since the Obama administration, but it was hampered by lawmakers who felt the 14-year-old agency was not as equipped to deal with cyber threats as the National Security Agency or FBI. Earlier this week, the bill moved through the House with unanimous support \u2014 signaling lawmakers\u2019 view on DHS\u2019s role in handling civilian cybersecurity is evolving.\n\nEdna Conway, Cisco\u2019s chief security officer for its global value chain, said thinks CISA will help companies and federal agencies with collaborate better on cybersecurity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if DHS is now becoming that clearinghouse,\u201d she said.\n\nConway said this is part of a broader effort for government and the private sector to come together on cybersecurity issues.\n\nBut such efforts have not always seen equal contributions from both sides. Two years ago, Congress passed legislation that was intended to incentivize companies to share information about cyber threats with the government. But Nextgov\u2019s Joseph Marks reported that as of July, only six companies and other nonfederal entities had shared that data with the government. A much greater number are able to receive cyber threat data from DHS \u2014 190 private entities and about 60 federal institutions, at the time of the Nextgov report.\n\nKrebs said the federal government has made a bigger push on cybersecurity since the Russian hacking campaign to influence the 2016 election in favor of Donald Trump. He said those revelations have galvanized government to focus more on this issue than ever.\n\nDuring the midterm elections, DHS undertook an unprecedented effort to secure the country\u2019s fragmented election systems, which required coordination and threat-sharing among various agencies, state and local election officials and technology companies. Yet for months leading up to the elections, many lawmakers were skeptical that the Trump administration was doing enough.\n\nSo far, Krebs said there has been no evidence of interference with election equipment in 2018. The agency is expected to publish a report on the outcome of its security efforts within 45 days of the midterms.\n\n\u201cWe made more progress in 18 months in these interagency partnerships, in sharing information, in sharing threats, co-location capabilities, than I think in the preceding decade,\u201d Krebs said. \u201cSometimes it does take these moments.\u201d\n\nPINGED, PATCHED, PWNED\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) on Capitol Hill in Washington on June 13, 2017. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nPINGED: Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said the Trump administration deserves \u201csome credit\u201d for its efforts to initiate a U.S. cyber doctrine, in particular through adoption of a directive updating the rules governing the launch of cyber operations. The directive, called National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, eases the process for setting cyber operations in motion. \u201cThey have changed their executive order about the willingness of America to use its cyber capabilities \u2014 both on a defense and offensive capability,\u201d Warner said during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nWarner, who serves as vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also said the United States lacked a cyber doctrine through the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. \u201cWe have ignored the reemergence of a near-peer adversary like Russia and the emergence of China, to the point where it\u2019s been open season in terms of these nations either interfering in our elections \u2014 in the case of Russia \u2014 stealing our intellectual property \u2014 in the case of China \u2014 and doing so with no fear of retribution from the United States,\u201d Warner said. He added that the development of a cyber doctrine ought to include international rules. \u201cWe desperately need an articulated cyber doctrine where there are norms \u2014 hopefully international norms \u2014 across the way so that we can respond as need be,\u201d Warner said.\n\nThe Facebook logo on an iPad in Philadelphia on May 16, 2012.

The company received 103,815 government requests for user data worldwide during the first half of 2018, Chris Sonderby, vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a post. Such requests stood at 82,341 during the second half of 2017, amounting to about a 26 percent increase. Government requests in the United States rose by about 30 percent, \u201cof which 56% included a non-disclosure order prohibiting Facebook from notifying the user,\u201d Sonderby said.\n\nHands type on a computer keyboard in Los Angeles on Feb. 27, 2013.

Prolonged exposure to UV light can be very harmful, especially to exposed skin.\n\nThe story surfaced this week after parents at the Dagang English Experimental Primary School in Tianjin found their kids after class complaining about sore eyes and vomiting. Medical checkups soon revealed the cause.\n\nParents uploaded pictures of their children with bandaged faces \u2014 as well as videos of their furious confrontations with school officials while stunned police looked on.

(Ahn Young-joon/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea says it is expelling American Bruce Byron Lowrance after he slipped unlawfully into the police state known for its anti-U.S. fervor.\n\nHe is believed to be the same person who was deported by South Korea a year ago after being caught wandering near the mine-strewn border with North Korea, looking for a way to cross over.\n\nSneaking into North Korea has proved to be a powerful temptation for some Americans. Some were driven by religious zeal, others simply were attracted by the mystery of a remote and cloistered country that seems the polar opposite of anything they had experienced.\n\nA look at some of the Americans who have entered North Korea in past decades:\n\n___\n\nBRUCE BYRON LOWRANCE\n\nThe North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Lowrance was detained last month after he entered illegally from the border with China. While it said he entered under the \u201cmanipulation\u201d of the CIA, many detained foreigners have said after their release from North Korea that their declarations of guilt were coerced.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s decision to deport Lowrance after only a month of confinement would be remarkably quick by Pyongyang\u2019s standards, apparently reflecting an eagerness to keep alive a positive atmosphere for dialogue with the United States.\n\nWashington and Pyongyang have been engaging in talks on the North\u2019s nuclear program since a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in June, when they issued vague aspirational goals for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn November last year, South Korea said a man matching Lowrance\u2019s name was caught in an area just south of the Demilitarized Zone without approval. The man later told South Korean investigators that he believed his trip to North Korea would resolve tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over the death of Otto Warmbier, an American university student who died last year days after being released from the North in a coma.\n\nLowrance was arrested in South Korea on the same day a North Korean soldier made a dramatic escape to the South, rushing across the border under a barrage of bullets fired by his former comrades.\n\n___\n\nOTTO WARMBIER\n\nWhile the majority of Americans detained by North Korea have been released in relatively good condition, Warmbier, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, died in June last year shortly after he was flown home comatose after 17 months in captivity.\n\nWarmbier was seized from a tour group while visiting North Korea in January 2016 and convicted on charges of trying to steal a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. North Korea has denied accusations by relatives that it tortured Warmbier and said he was provided \u201cmedical treatments and care with all sincerity.\u201d The North accused the United States of a smear campaign and called itself the \u201cbiggest victim\u201d in his death.\n\n___\n\nMATTHEW MILLER\n\nIn September 2014 North Korea sentenced Miller \u2014 then a 24-year-old from Bakersfield, California \u2014 to six years of hard labor on charges he illegally entered the country to commit espionage.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Supreme Court said Miller tore up his tourist visa at Pyongyang\u2019s airport upon arrival in April that year and admitted to the \u201cwild ambition\u201d of experiencing prison life so that he could secretly investigate North Korea\u2019s human rights situation.\n\nMiller was freed in November that year along with another American, Kenneth Bae, a missionary and tour leader.\n\nWeeks before his release, Miller spoke briefly to The Associated Press at a Pyongyang hotel where the North Korean government allowed him to call his family. He said he was digging in fields eight hours a day and being kept in isolation.\n\n___\n\nKENNETH BAE\n\nBae, from Lynnwood, Washington, was detained in November 2012 while leading a tour group in North Korea. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for \u201chostile acts\u201d after being accused of smuggling in inflammatory literature and trying to establish a base for anti-government activities at a border city hotel.\n\nWhile in detention, he told a pro-North Korea newspaper based in Japan that he felt abandoned. His family said he suffered from chronic health issues, including back pain, diabetes, an enlarged heart and liver problems.\n\nBae went home in November 2014 after a secret mission by the U.S. intelligence chief at the time, James Clapper, secured his release, as well as that of Miller. A month earlier, North Korea released another U.S. citizen, Jeffrey Fowle, after detaining him for six months for leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the city of Chongjin.\n\nNorth Korea officially guarantees freedom of religion, but analysts and defectors describe the country as militantly anti-religious.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Friday recognized a major Republican Party donor and six other \u201cextraordinary Americans\u201d with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the nation reserves for a civilian.\n\nIndividuals who make \u201coutstanding contributions to American life and culture\u201d have received the medal, Trump said, adding that it was his \u201ctrue privilege\u201d to present it to six men and one woman representing the fields of entertainment, sports, law, medicine, politics and philanthropy.\n\nMiriam Adelson is a doctor, philanthropist and wife of Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate considered one of the nation\u2019s most powerful Republican donors. The Adelsons donated $30 million to Trump\u2019s campaign in the final months of the 2016 race. They followed up by donating $100 million to the Republican Party for last week\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nTrump says Miriam Adelson is \u201csomebody who\u2019s worked so hard. Doesn\u2019t have to do it, but she does, 24 hours a day, this is what she does.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough decades of innovative research, philanthropy and treatment, Miriam has helped thousands break free from their addiction to drugs and alcohol,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI know the work you\u2019ve done, and you have been truly incredible.\u201d\n\nMiriam Adelson is an Israeli-born, naturalized U.S. citizen who earned a medical degree from Tel Aviv University and founded drug abuse treatment and research centers in Las Vegas and Tel Aviv. She and her husband own the Las Vegas Review-Journal and Israel Hayom newspapers.\n\nThe Adelsons are also avid supporters of Israel. Trump noted how \u201cvery happy\u201d they were that he moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nTrump also honored Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. One of the longest-serving Republican senators in U.S. history, Hatch is retiring in January after more than 40 years. Trump called Hatch a \u201cgreat friend of mine\u201d who \u201cliked me right from the beginning, and therefore I like him.\u201d\n\nRetired Minnesota Supreme Court justice Alan Page, who played with the NFL\u2019s Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears before transitioning to a career in law, and Roger Staubach, the Hall of Fame quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, were also honored.\n\nPosthumous honors were given to Elvis Presley, baseball\u2019s Babe Ruth and Antonin Scalia, the conservative Supreme Court justice. Six of the nine justices currently serving on the U.S. Supreme Court, including newest member Brett Kavanaugh, attended the White House ceremony.\n\nTrump said Ruth and Presley are \u201ctrue legends\u201d whose legacies will live on forever.\n\nSome questioned Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Miriam Adelson so soon after the Nov. 6 election.\n\nRobert Weissman, president of the public interest group Public Citizen, said the decision was \u201cemblematic of the corrupt and transactional presidency of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBut Elliott Abrams, who held foreign policy positions under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, called the complaints \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nAbrams noted that Miriam Adelson has donated her time and money to combatting addiction. He contrasted her award with those given by President Barack Obama to Chita Rivera, Robert De Niro, Barbra Streisand, Ellen DeGeneres and Warren Buffett, among others.\n\n\u201cPeople who said nothing about all of that and now criticize the medal for Dr. Adelson are simply being nasty and partisan, and are not actually taking a look at her remarkable knowledge and charity in the chemical addiction field,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump used the process previous administrations followed to select his nominees. It was coordinated by the staff secretary\u2019s office, incorporating recommendations from the public, relevant presidential advisory bodies, the Cabinet and senior White House staff.\n\nPresidents have total discretion over whom they honor with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nThe award is given to individuals \u201cwho have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\u201d\n\nMiriam Adelson said she is \u201cdeeply humbled and moved by this exceptional honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiberty is at the heart of my decades of work against substance abuse. Drug dependency is enslavement, for the user and his or her family and society, and treatment an emancipation,\u201d she said in a statement Thursday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Steve Peoples in New York, Michelle Price in Las Vegas and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bossie, a former deputy Trump campaign manager.\n\nSince the midterm elections, no evidence has emerged suggesting results were tainted by illegal votes, from illegal immigrants or anyone else.\n\nThe statement was par for the course for Dobbs, who was bashing immigrants before it was fashionable, citing misleading evidence or none at all. Last month, he invoked the word \u201cinvasion\u201d dozens of times on his program when talking about the migrant caravan, according to NPR, parroting the same language used by President Trump.\n\nDobbs didn\u2019t even pretend to have evidence of the illegal voting Thursday night. He just said it, apropos of nothing, during his show, \u201cLou Dobbs Tonight.\u201d\n\nHe referred to a recent study from Yale and MIT, the reliability of which has been questioned by other researchers: \u201cIf there are, as Yale and MIT say, 20 to 30 million illegal immigrants already in this country,\u201d Dobbs said, \u201cyou know what that means for the districts of the U.S. Congress and the influence that they\u2019re giving to, for example, the state of California, Illinois, New York.\u201d\n\nDobbs, according to Forbes, is \u201cthe most-watched host in business television.\u201d He has a following of hundreds of thousands of viewers and 1.85 million Twitter followers.\n\nBefore joining Fox Business Network, Dobbs built his career at CNN by blaming illegal immigrants for everything from deadly disease to a significant portion of the nation\u2019s crime. His take on border security once led the New Yorker\u2019s satirist Andy Borowitz to jokingly write that former president George W. Bush, \u201cin his toughest stand yet against illegal immigration,\u201d sent Dobbs to the border to fend off border crossers in lieu of 10,000 troops from the National Guard.\n\nWhile at CNN, Dobbs said an \u201carmy of invaders\u201d from Mexico was crossing the border illegally as part of a plan to \u201ctake over\u201d the southwestern United States. He has misleadingly said undocumented immigrants comprise one-third of the federal prison population. And perhaps most notoriously, Dobbs said in 2005 that an \u201cinvasion of illegal aliens is threatening the health of many Americans,\u201d before turning to a report wrongly finding that, despite there being only \u201c900 cases of leprosy for 40 years,\u201d there had been \u201c7,000 in the past three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncredible,\u201d Dobbs said. In fact, there had been 7,000 leprosy cases in the last 30 years. When Lesley Stahl of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d confronted him about the assertion two years later, telling him there appeared to be no evidence to support the claim, Dobbs stood his ground. \u201cWell, I can tell you this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we reported it, it\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\nHe abruptly resigned from CNN in 2009 after Jonathan Klein, then the president of CNN, gave him an ultimatum: tone down the rhetoric or leave. When he quit, he toyed with the idea of running for president.\n\nMore recently, Fox Business Network found itself apologizing for Dobbs. The network pulled an October episode of \u201cLou Dobbs Tonight\u201d in which the host\u2019s guest, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch, said the migrant caravan was being funded by the George \u201cSoros-occupied State Department.\u201d There was no pushback from Dobbs and Fox Business soon \u201ccondemn[ed] the rhetoric\u201d in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for Fox Business Network did not immediately return a request for comment regarding Dobbs\u2019s latest assertion.\n\nThe comment recalls Trump\u2019s baseless assertion after the 2016 presidential election that 3 million to 5 million illegal votes cost him the popular vote. Dobbs told The Washington Post then that he believed the president\u2019s critics and the news media rushed to judgment when reporting the president\u2019s statement was false.\n\n\u201cYou cannot say the president has made a false statement when he says there are 3 to 5 million illegal votes, in his judgment,\u201d Dobbs told The Post. \u201cWe don\u2019t know on what basis he made the claim. But we do know this: It\u2019s speculative, and therefore it is a good thing because all he is asking for is an investigation of it and is pursuing it.\u201d\n\nNo evidence was ever found to support the claim.\n\nAides for Trump \u2014 who most recently claimed without evidence that people were changing into different clothes and hats in their cars in the parking lots of polling places to disguise themselves and vote twice \u2014 pointed to research from Old Dominion University to support the mass illegal voting assertion in 2016. The study, which has been challenged by other researchers, found 14 percent of noncitizens were registered to vote. But its authors warned it was impossible to extrapolate that to represent the entire population of noncitizens.\n\nAs The Post has reported, even if it were possible to extrapolate the data, and even if, in that hypothetical world, all 14 percent of those noncitizens voted at the same rate as citizens, that would still account for just 1.1 percent of all votes.\n\nBeautiful day at the White House!

And already, as if starring in the Netflix buddy flick you didn\u2019t even know you were craving, they appear to have become best friends.\n\n\u201cSquad,\u201d wrote Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, captioning an Instagram photo in which she posed with Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib \u2014 her fellow newly elected U.S. congresswomen, all grinning around a conference room table.\n\n\u201c#DreamTeam in Congress,\u201d wrote Tlaib, of Michigan, on a different photo of the same group.\n\n\u201cWe did not come to play,\u201d wrote Omar, of Minnesota, on an image of her sitting beside Pressley at an informational session.\n\nThe posts exude gratefulness and camaraderie; these women never seem to miss an opportunity to lift one another up or highlight each others\u2019 accomplishments. \u201cI am inspired by the incredible work she has done for her community,\u201d wrote Sharice Davids (Kan.), one of the first two Native American women to join Congress, as she stood with her arm around Deb Haaland (N.M.), the other one.\n\nTheir affection for one another seems earnest, and these photos have inspired daydreams bordering on fan fiction. Online, hundreds of supporters have speculated what it would be like to go to coffee or to a sleepover with this particular group of elected officials. Others \u2014 not fans \u2014 have met the posts with an eyeroll, calling them juvenile or not befitting the dignity of the office.\n\nBut categorizing the posts as merely giggly \u201csquad goals\u201d is missing a deeper point, I think. There\u2019s sophisticated work going into the messaging. These social media posts aren\u2019t just about female friendship; they\u2019re also about the behind-the-scenes strategies women in mostly male workplaces have always employed to get stuff done.\n\nFemale White House staffers in the Obama administration, for example, popularized a meeting strategy they\u2019d dubbed \u201camplification.\u201d Tired of men ignoring their ideas \u2014 or worse, claiming them as their own \u2014 they decided to reiterate the good ideas voiced by other women in the room and made sure the female creator received proper credit.\n\nFacebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, whose \u201cLean In\u201d simultaneously empowered and exhausted millions of readers, regularly encourages women to negotiate \u201ccommunally.\u201d Women advocating for their own success are perceived as bossy or self-involved, Sandberg says, and so they should instead argue that their success will benefit the greater good.\n\nAnd studies have found that women tend to thrive more in collaborative working environments than combative ones.\n\nBaked into every one of these strategies is a common notion: that women do better when their success is sneaky. Or self-deprecating. When they emphatically thank everyone who pushed them from behind and everyone who paved the road ahead. When they \u2014 as multiple newly elected female representatives did this week \u2014 pose gratefully in front of a portrait of Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress.\n\nCompare this with Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who on Wednesday was elected House minority leader. McCarthy also has an Instagram account, with nearly 30,000 followers. A longtime public servant, he often posts pictures of himself meeting with constituents. But the image he chose to feature on election night was of himself, alone, under a giant banner: \u201cKevin McCarthy: Protecting our freedoms.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s unfair to compare the Instagram prowess of younger digital natives with the photo choices of a 53-year-old. The point is that different messages work better for different groups of people. Both can be effective. Both can be great. But I sense that female politicians positioning themselves as individualistic, heroic protectors wouldn\u2019t go over so well.\n\nWhy do I sense that? It\u2019s happening already. You might have seen headlines about Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 the midterm\u2019s biggest breakout star, who ousted a 10-term incumbent in the New York primary \u2014 joining activists in protest at Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office. Immediately, pundits, both armchair and television, portrayed this as a catfight or rebellion: Ocasio-Cortez was immature and showboating; Pelosi (D-Calif.), the presumptive speaker of the House, wasn\u2019t a strong enough leader to keep her people under control.\n\nBut what Ocasio-Cortez actually told assembled activists was far from combative: \u201cShould Leader Pelosi become the next speaker of the House, we need to tell her that we\u2019ve got her back in showing and pursuing the most progressive energy agenda that this country has ever seen.\u201d\n\nShe spoke of her \u201cadmiration\u201d for the veteran politician and praised Pelosi\u2019s \u201ccivic engagement.\u201d\n\nThe young women who have come to Congress have come to elevate, praise and admire one another. Not because they\u2019re immature fangirls but because this coalition-building is their best hope for success in what remains, at its core, another mostly male workplace.\n\nI keep thinking about an exchange recounted by the New York Times a few days ago, in which Haaland ran into a male Republican congressman in the elevator. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be at each others\u2019 throats eventually,\u201d he told her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she replied, apparently surprised.\n\nIt didn\u2019t sound like someone ready to fight to win. It was the response of someone who\u2019d rather find a more productive path than fighting.\n\nMonica Hesse is a columnist writing about gender and its impact on society.

Details of the plan, announced in a larger governmental reorganization proposal dubbed \u201cDelivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century,\u201d are expected soon.\n\nIt\u2019s not certain that privatization will be the administration\u2019s favored solution, but the postal unions want to stop consideration of any solution leading to postal privatization.\n\nThe ad shows postal customers frustrated with poor service under a privatized system. One customer beats his rural roadside mailbox with a sledgehammer, and then a smiling postal worker is shown delivering a package under the current system.\n\n\u201cTell your member of Congress, \u2018No way,\u2019\u201d the announcer says. \u201cThe U.S. Postal Service. Keep it. It\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\nA Trump executive order in April established a task force to evaluate the money-losing Postal Service. Its operations, beleaguered with bureaucratic obstacles, are funded by sales of postage and services, not tax dollars. A report by the task force, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is expected by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe unions want to frame the debate before the administration does.\n\n\u201cSelling of the Postal Service would be a gift to Wall Street and a setback to everyone in this country who receives mail,\u201d APWU President Mark Dimondstein said. \u201cThis is the people\u2019s post office, older than the nation itself, enshrined in the Constitution, with the highest favorability rating of any federal agency. We need to send a clear message to the White House that the U.S. mail is not for sale.\u201d\n\nThe ad will start on social media and other digital platforms, then move to broadcast. The broadcast buy isn\u2019t finalized, but labor leaders expect the bill to exceed $100,000. This is part of a larger effort to block a privatization plan before one is issued. In October, there were events in 150 cities, according to union figures. Many of those generated media attention to the administration\u2019s plan and reasons to oppose it.\n\nA Treasury Department statement said, \u201cPreliminary findings were presented to the President in August, and we are working towards releasing the full report by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s restructuring plans call for USPS \u201cto return it to a sustainable business model or prepare it for future conversion from a Government agency into a privately-held corporation.\u201d While presenting privatization as an option, Trump\u2019s proposal leaned in that direction. There was no attempt to hide that taking USPS private would take service, including door-to-door delivery, away from customers.\n\n\u201cA private postal operator that delivers mail fewer days per week and to more central locations (not door delivery) would operate at substantially lower costs,\u201d the document acknowledged.\n\nThe impact on rural areas would be particularly hard, according to NALC President Fredric Rolando. \u201cRural communities are having a hard time competing due to high transportation costs and a lack of broadband services,\u201d he said. \u201cEliminating the universal service requirement would be the kiss of death for many businesses and individuals in these areas.\u201d\n\nNot only would customers pay more for less, but postal employees also would probably have their compensation cut.\n\n\u201cA private entity would also have greater ability to adjust product pricing in response to changes in demand or operating costs,\u201d the administration\u2019s report said. \u201cFreeing USPS to more fully negotiate pay and benefits rather than prescribing participation in costly Federal personnel benefit programs, and allowing it to follow private sector practices in compensation and labor relations, could further reduce costs.\u201d\n\nEveryone wants USPS to have a sustainable business model, though opinions on how to make that happen differ. Opposition to a privatized Postal Service is strong on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s hopes and plans to privatize the Postal Service is not based in political reality. More than 239 members of Congress have come out in opposition to privatization of the Postal Service,\u201d said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (Va.), the top Democrat on the House government operations subcommittee. \u201cInstead of pursuing this damaging and eventually fruitless exercise, the administration should work with Congress to fix the problems facing the Postal Service.\u201d\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, was noncommittal. Asked for comment, his staff provided a vague one from a hearing in April, before the administration issued the reorganization plan.\n\n\u201cWe need to understand what it is going to take to make the postal system a long-term, economically viable organization, which it is not today,\u201d Johnson said then. Pressed for more, his spokesman added: \u201cThat is still his position.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s really no position. But he\u2019ll have another opportunity soon, when Trump\u2019s task force makes the administration\u2019s position clear.\n\nRead more:\n\nCongressional opposition to Trump\u2019s postal cuts, privatization plan grows\n\nPostal Service \u2014 the preferred shipper for drug dealers\n\nWill Trump\u2019s budget cut mail delivery?

Reading in the morning paper that the 80-plus degree temperature of the Gulf\u2019s water might make the approaching Hurricane Michael the \u201cworst ever, with a probable 12-foot storm surge,\u201d I picked up the phone.\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d she said, \u201ceven if it comes up 14 feet, which it\u2019s done before, it won\u2019t reach me.\u201d\n\nI told her I hoped she was right, and that I\u2019d call again in a couple of hours. (She was right.)\n\nScience says climate change will trigger more and more \u201cworst-ever\u201d hurricanes, rains, fires, tornadoes, mudslides, droughts, genocides, fascist trends, ethnic cleansings, etc.\n\nFollow me, please, as I try to call attention to what I believe is a fundamental, unaddressed problem with schooling in America.\n\nWhat lies ahead for students are major messes \u2014 global warming, nonstop wars, disposing of radioactive waste, reversing wealth concentration, and dozens of other problems they didn\u2019t create but have to try to clean up or figure out how to live with.\n\nTo do that, they\u2019ll need to generate new knowledge, but they aren\u2019t being taught how. Instead, they are spending most of the school day cramming existing information into short-term memory. The ability to recall secondhand information rewards everybody from test-taking students to nearby property owners to holders of stock in manufacturers of tests, but it\u2019s of very limited usefulness when technological, environmental, demographic and cognitive change are interacting to create problems of ever-increasing, mind-boggling complexity.\n\nThe situation calls for a continuous stream of new knowledge \u2014 lots of it \u2014 knowledge that can\u2019t be taught because nobody yet knows what needs to be known.\n\nFor the young to have a fighting chance of coping with what lies ahead, schooling\u2019s emphasis needs to switch from recalling information to relating information, for the obvious reason that information becomes knowledge as new relationships (\u2194) are discovered.\n\ninfant fusses \u2194 gets fed\n\nsharp objects \u2194 pain\n\nmicrobes \u2194 disease\n\nfeelings of insecurity \u2194 opposition to immigration\n\ngreenhouse gases \u2194 global warming\n\ndiffering worldviews \u2194 war\n\nspace \u2194 time\n\nTraditional core curriculum-based schooling compartmentalizes knowledge, blocking the knowledge-creating relating process.\n\nAbout 18 years ago, in a newspaper column distributed by Knight-Ridder/Tribune, I was doing what I\u2019m doing now \u2014 trying to convince people in general and education policymakers in particular that the core curriculum is the main reason for decade after decade of basically flat academic performance, and reforms make little or no difference. The bottom-line purpose of schooling is expanding understanding of how the world works, and the real world doesn\u2019t compartmentalize knowledge by academic discipline or school subject. I wrote:\n\nIn the real world, the world we\u2019re trying to help the young understand, everything connects to everything. We want a pair of socks. Those available have been knitted in a Third World country. Power to run the knitting machines is supplied by burning fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming. Global warming alters weather patterns. Altered weather patterns trigger environmental catastrophes. Environmental catastrophes destroy infrastructure. Money spent for infrastructure replacement isn\u2019t available for health care. Declines in the quality of health care affect mortality rates. Mortality is a matter of life and death. Buying socks, then, is a matter of life and death. Making sense of this simple cause-effect sequence requires not only some understanding of marketing, physics, chemistry, meteorology, economics, engineering, psychology, sociology, political science and a couple of other fields not usually taught in school, it requires an understanding of how all the fields fit together. Preparing to put a jigsaw puzzle together, we study the picture on the lid of the box. It\u2019s the grasp of the big picture\u2014the whole\u2014that helps us make sense of the individual pieces. Formal education doesn\u2019t give kids the big picture. It gives them instead a little biology, a little poetry, a little history, a little of this, a little of that, but nothing about how the bits and pieces are connected and reinforce each other.\n\nTo those ends \u2014 moving education toward systems thinking \u2014 the links below access a short explanatory e-book; a course of study that introduces systems thinking via firsthand, real-world experience; and three courses that repurpose traditional social studies content in ways consistent with systems theory. All lessons were written for adolescents of middle school age and older, and may be downloaded without cost or other obligation.\n\nWeek after week of downloads averaging more than 2,500, without a penny spent on advertising, in an environment hostile to schooling not focused on raising standardized test scores, suggests the potential of systems-based curriculums to drive consequential, continuously evolving education reform.\n\nA. e-book, \u201cWhat\u2019s Worth Learning?\u201d http://www.marionbrady.com/documents/WWL.pdf\n\nB.

Phillip/AP)\n\nClimate change was on the ballot in cities and states across the United States last week. The results disappointed people who had hoped that in some states, at least, Americans were ready to tackle global warming. Of the high-profile initiatives aimed at weaning the nation off fossil fuels, a majority failed to pass. Some observers concluded that \u201cvoters still shrug\u201d about climate change, or, more starkly, \u201cthe climate lost.\u201d\n\nLosses included a carbon tax initiative in Washington state, a renewable energy mandate in Arizona and new fracking restrictions in Colorado. All this suggests that it\u2019s hard to persuade people to pay to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This isn\u2019t surprising. Even in left-leaning states, Americans rank climate change as a low priority, compared to many other public issues. What\u2019s more, electric utilities and the oil and gas industry spent heavily to defeat the measures, which, research shows, often reduces the likelihood that such measures will pass.\n\nBut another set of ballot measures related to climate change has received less attention. While voters rejected major efforts to slow the advance of climate change, they mostly supported measures to adapt to climate change impacts.\n\n[Will climate change lead to mass migration and conflict?]\n\nInvesting in slowing climate change is different from investing in adapting to climate change.\n\nThe politics of adapting to climate change are different from the politics of limiting the magnitude of climate change.\n\nState and local efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions impose costs that are concentrated and immediate, but offer benefits that are spread across the globe and may never be visible.\n\nBut when a community invests in adapting to climate change, those taxpayers benefit more directly, in two ways. First, investing in adaptation can help the community endure and survive natural disasters and other climate change effects \u2014 both boosting the local economy and keeping people safe. For instance, improved wastewater infrastructure along the coast reduces the nuisance and public health risk of being exposed to raw sewage in the case of flooding from storm events and sea level rise. And it also puts people to work.\n\nSecond, adaptation efforts may offer value for a community whether or not the climate changes. For instance, a city might invest in green spaces to reduce flooding \u2014 resulting in more parks, lower urban temperatures, and other human health benefits. As a result, advocates for these policies don\u2019t have to argue about whether humans have changed the climate, which is an ideological minefield that makes climate politics challenging.\n\nStill, for a variety of reasons, Americans have been slow to invest in the infrastructure that will protect against climate-related risks. Research shows that while many communities are starting to plan for adaptation, funding these efforts remains a challenge.\n\n[What does it take to build climate resilience \u2014 especially among the world\u2019s most vulnerable?]\n\nA few initiatives to adapt to climate change passed.\n\nThe midterm elections changed that, if only slightly. In two New England states, voters approved bonds for clean water infrastructure. Maine and Rhode Island are targeting funds toward improving the performance of wastewater and storm-water systems when there\u2019s flooding, and Rhode Island will set aside money to improve the resiliency of vulnerable coastal habitats.\n\nIn California, two local measures won the necessary two-thirds support for major investments in protective infrastructure. San Franciscans approved a $425 million bond to rebuild the Embarcadero sea wall, which will help protect the city as sea levels rise. Los Angeles County voters adopted a new parcel tax on paved surfaces, which will pay for storm water improvements to reduce pollution and capture more storm water to boost the region\u2019s fragile water supply. Supporters had abandoned a similar measure in 2013 when it met strong opposition.\n\nAnd in Houston, which recently had a disastrous hurricane, 75 percent of voters reapproved a fund to pay for drainage projects and street repairs.\n\nVirginia passed the most controversial adaptation measure: a constitutional amendment allowing local governments to cut taxes on flood-prone properties if homeowners make investments that reduce the home\u2019s flood risk. It\u2019s controversial because of how it handles one of the most difficult tensions in adaptation policy: the tension between encouraging relocation away from climate-related risks and maintaining local tax bases to protect those who remain.\n\n[The climate is changing. Here\u2019s how politics will also change.]\n\nIt\u2019s a start.\n\nThese votes didn\u2019t signal that Americans are fully ready to pay the costs of adapting to climate change. Many measures were not framed in climate change language at all. And voters approved public spending for other types of infrastructure as well \u2014 for example, passing the majority of transportation ballot measures that appeared before them.\n\nBut given the stream of news articles noting that greenhouse-gas-reduction measures failed, it\u2019s worth noting a quiet signal that Americans are beginning, at least, to recognize that we need to protect ourselves from climate change\u2019s effects.\n\nRead The Monkey Cage\u2019s climate change posts.\n\nMegan Mullin is associate professor of environmental politics and political science at Duke University.

The pedophile subplot isn\u2019t a major one, but it does involve an older (though still young) man preying on a teen.

(Themba Hadebe, File/Associated Press)\n\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The rescue of 33 lions from South American circuses and their 2016 transfer to a South African refuge was billed as a compassionate gesture, a return \u201chome\u201d after years of abuse and living in cages. Things didn\u2019t turn out as planned.\n\nAnimal Defenders International, a group that airlifted the lions to South Africa, has secured a court order allowing the removal of 27 surviving lions from the Emoya Big Cat Sanctuary in Vaalwater. The two organizations had collaborated on the project, but disputes over alleged mismanagement at the sanctuary soon arose and six lions have died since arriving there.\n\n\u201cADI believes that if we leave our rescued lions at Emoya, they will die before their time,\u201d Animal Defenders International said Thursday. \u201cWe will move the animals as soon as possible and in accordance with the court order.\u201d\n\nThe group said it was acting after the \u201cpreventable deaths\u201d of five lions, including from food poisoning and poaching, and that it was denied immediate access to another lion that died. Animal Defenders International cited \u201cother problems including misappropriation of funds, materials for the lions and associations with trophy hunters and more.\u201d\n\nEmoya has denied allegations of wrongdoing and said the South African court ruling against it is based solely on a 90-day termination clause in its contract with Animal Defenders International.\n\n\u201cThe truth is this: Despite unforeseen tragic events, the lions have been and are in excellent condition,\u201d Emoya said on its website. The lions live in large enclosures \u201cin the natural Africa habitat,\u201d receive a venison diet with added supplements and are protected by an upgraded security system, according to Emoya.\n\nWhile Animal Defenders International said it is organizing a \u201croad trip\u201d for the lions to another location, Emoya said the move can only happen if it is satisfied with the logistics of the lion transfer. The judge\u2019s order requires Emoya to \u201cdo whatever is necessary\u201d to coordinate the return of the lions to the animal defense group.\n\nNine of the original 33 lions were surrendered by a circus in Colombia. The remaining 24 were rescued in raids on circuses in Peru as part of a crackdown on wildlife trafficking. The transfer to South Africa had no conservationist value because the animals, which were in poor condition, had been held in captivity and could not live in the wild.\n\n___\n\nFollow Christopher Torchia on Twitter at www.twitter.com/torchiachris\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The area and Arlington, Va., will become home to Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. (AP) (Mark Lennihan/AP)\n\nReporter\n\nNew York and Virginia have given Amazon somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion in tax breaks to persuade it to do what it was probably already going to: open its two new headquarters in their states.\n\nBut as easy as it is to point out how wasteful this is \u2014 literally anything would be a better use of this money but especially if it went toward needed investments in schools and infrastructure \u2014 it\u2019s hard to get governments to stop handing out these kind of goodies. Why is that? Well, part of it is a simple matter of misaligned incentives: Politicians get to bask in the glow of positive headlines about all the jobs they\u2019re supposedly bringing to their communities but aren\u2019t around for the negative consequences when, as is often the case, things end up costing more and delivering less than was promised.\n\nThere\u2019s more to it than just that, though. The same reason that it doesn\u2019t make any sense for New York to subsidize Amazon \u2014 agglomeration \u2014 is also why politicians might feel pressured to do so nonetheless. Which is to say that America\u2019s cities are stuck in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma where no matter how obvious it seems that they not engage in corporate welfare, they still do, because even losing once raises the specter of losing over and over again. (Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThe important thing to understand here is that, at least within the United States, taxes don\u2019t have a lot to do with where companies set up shop. If they did, Silicon Valley would be in Texas instead of California. Or, more to the point, Amazon\u2019s second headquarters would be in Atlanta instead of Northern Virginia. Indeed, Georgia put together a much more generous incentive package that not only included $2 billion in direct subsidies, but also, as if we needed further confirmation that we live in a post-parody age, the kind of private subway car just for Amazon employees that the Onion had joked about cities desperately offering.\n\nSo what does matter, then? Simple: workers, workers, workers. Or, as former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer memorably put it: developers, developers, developers. Now, being near a top-tier research university can help create a pipeline of future employees, but what\u2019s even more important are the companies that are already in a place. Having a lot of other tech companies around, for example, means that there\u2019s a big pool of tech workers for Amazon to hire from down the line. Which it freely admitted was its biggest consideration. \u201cEconomic incentives were one factor in our decision,\u201d Amazon wrote on its blog, \u201cbut attracting top talent was the leading driver.\u201d\n\nThere are bigger benefits, in other words, to clustering around companies like your own than there are to just getting a tax write-off. And it\u2019s not just about hiring, either. It\u2019s also about the kind of cross-pollination of ideas that happens when you\u2019re around like-minded companies. You\u2019re quicker to adopt new and better ways of doing things, and to come up with even newer and even better ways yourselves. It\u2019s what economists call the benefits of agglomeration, and it\u2019s the opposite of Yogi Berra\u2019s famous saying: Everyone wants to go there because it\u2019s too crowded.\n\nWhich is why New York and Virginia shouldn\u2019t have had to use the lure of tax breaks to get Amazon to come. It probably would have wanted to anyways. These places, after all, already have pretty big tech footprints, are geographically close to other important industries and have the infrastructure in place to handle lots of new workers. If anything, they should have been using the money they spent subsidizing Amazon to upgrading their existing \u2014 and far too often faltering \u2014 public transit to make themselves more attractive to businesses in general.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to see how they could feel blackmailed into doing otherwise. Just because you\u2019re a cluster today, doesn\u2019t mean you will be tomorrow. Letting Amazon go, as we said before, to Atlanta might make it more likely that the next one would, too. And before you know it, then you\u2019re the one having to offer billions and billions more than other cities to try to attract tech companies. Better to grease the wheels with a slightly smaller, but still significant, subsidy \u2014 or so they tell themselves. The reality, of course, is that New York and the D.C. metro area really don\u2019t have anything to worry about, but corporations still know how to prey on their insecurities. As The Atlantic\u2019s Derek Thompson points out, state and local governments spend upward of $90 billion a year trying to poach jobs from one another this way. This is macroeconomically useless behavior that, studies show, doesn\u2019t improve overall job creation. All it does is increase short-term stock prices at the cost of not increasing our long-term ability to grow.\n\nThis arms race between cities is a lot like the one over college admissions. In both cases, the results probably don\u2019t matter as much as people think, but, because we live in such an unequal society, they don\u2019t want to take a chance on it. So rich cities, like well-off families, do everything they can to stack the deck in their favor, even when they really don\u2019t have to. The rewards for success are so high now that anything else seems irresponsible.\n\nOr at least that\u2019s what Corporate America wants you to think."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Spat over WWII brothels shows Japan's trouble facing past", "description": "A journalist close to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has defended her view that South Korean women who were sent into Japanese WWII military brothels were not sex slaves, accusing a liberal-leaning newspaper of fabrication", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/spat-over-wwii-brothels-shows-japans-trouble-facing-past/2018/11/16/d05f6c2a-e98d-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:53:14Z", "content": "TOKYO A journalist close to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has defended her view that South Korean women who were sent into Japanese WWII military brothels were not sex slaves, accusing a liberal-leaning newspaper of fabrication.

(Kyodo News via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nTOKYO \u2014 A journalist close to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has defended her view that Korean women who were sent to Japanese wartime military brothels were not sex slaves, and accused a liberal-leaning newspaper of fabrication.\n\nOne of the newspaper\u2019s reporters said a day earlier that the journalist\u2019s comments triggered threats against him and had interfered with the settlement of the issue between Japan and South Korea.\n\nTheir public spat \u2014 a defamation suit by reporter Takashi Uemura against journalist Yoshiko Sakurai \u2014 highlights Japan\u2019s struggle to come to terms with its wartime atrocities more than 70 years after World War II.\n\nThe two represent the divide. The conservatives hold the Asahi newspaper, where Uemura used to work, responsible for spreading the impression that all so-called \u201ccomfort women\u201d were coerced. Liberals say evidence, including court documents and accounts of the women, shows many people were forced into sexual slavery.\n\nSakurai told a news conference on Friday that she sympathizes with comfort women despite their being \u201cprostitutes\u201d but that \u201cI still think the Asahi and Mr. Uemura should be held accountable\u201d for hurting Japan\u2019s image. She said Japan can\u2019t have a unified view of its wartime history because of what she called media bias.\n\nSakurai spearheads the view of Japanese nationalists that comfort women were voluntary prostitutes, and that Japan has been unfairly criticized for a practice they say is common in any country at war. Sakurai, a former newscaster at Nippon Television, is close to the country\u2019s powerful conservative political lobby, which includes many lawmakers in Abe\u2019s Cabinet and ruling Liberal Democratic Party and backs Abe\u2019s campaign for an amendment of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution.\n\nUemura, who currently teaches at a university in South Korea while heading a liberal Japanese magazine, says he is worried about a widening gap in the understanding of wartime history between the two countries, especially as female students in South Korea increasingly sympathize with the victims from the perspective of sexual violence against women. The comfort women and other wartime issues have often strained relations between Tokyo and Seoul, most recently after a South Korean court ruling on Japan\u2019s forced mobilization of Korean laborers during the war.\n\n\u201cThe point is not whether the comfort women involved forced recruitment or human trafficking. Let\u2019s just squarely face the damage done, overcome it and join hands in promoting understanding among Asian countries,\u201d Uemura told a news conference in Tokyo on Thursday.\n\nUemura in 2015 filed a defamation suit against Sakurai and three publishers that carried articles by her that alleged his stories were \u201cfabrication.\u201d A district court in Sapporo in northern Japan ruled last Friday that Sakurai\u2019s articles hurt Uemura\u2019s reputation but did not amount to defamation.\n\nAt issue are two articles Uemura wrote for the Asahi 27 years ago, including one based on the account of the first South Korean comfort woman to come forward, Kim Hak-soon. Uemura has been criticized by conservatives since then, but their attacks have escalated in recent years. After Sakurai\u2019s magazine articles in 2014 accused him of fabricating the comfort women issue, threats were sent to him, his family and a university in Sapporo where he taught after losing a promised professorship elsewhere.\n\nUemura wants Sakurai and the magazines to publish an apology and pay 16.5 million yen ($146,000) in compensation. He said he will appeal to a high court. He has also filed other libel suits against a scholar and a publisher in Tokyo.\n\nHistorians say tens of thousands of women, including Japanese, Koreans and others from around Asia were sent to front-line military brothels to provide sex for Japanese soldiers. A 1991-1993 Japanese government investigation concluded many of the women were recruited against their will, leading to a landmark Japanese apology. The investigation found no written proof in official documents, and conservatives have cited that in arguing the women were not coerced.\n\nA fund set up by Japan\u2019s government in 1995 paid nearly 5 billion yen ($44 million) for medical care and welfare for more than 280 women, including 61 South Koreans, but many others in that country rejected the money under a policy of their support group to seek further official apologies. The two countries are still divided despite a 2015 agreement intended to resolve the differences.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Whitaker has privately voiced concerns directly to [Trump] about a new bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, according to a GOP senator Whitaker met with Thursday, amid growing opposition to the legislation Trump endorsed with much fanfare this week.\u201d\n\nThe Post's Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey reported late last night that \u201cActing attorney general has privately voiced concerns directly to [Trump] about a new bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, according to a GOP senator Whitaker met with Thursday, amid growing opposition to the legislation Trump endorsed with much fanfare this week.\u201d In Congress: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) have remained noncommittal about the bill, expressing skepticism about being able to garner enough votes for passage. Then there's also Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who has been perhaps the most prominent voice of opposition to the overhaul, despite his close relationship with Trump, and is now whipping against the bill. Some think he's doing so at the behest of McConnell.\n\nPower Up talked with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) about reform, a key priority on which he has worked to craft a compromise for years. He sounded off on opponents like Cotton, who he believes are misunderstanding how tough the bill still is on criminals: \u201cI hope he doesn't think I\u2019m some left-wing liberal extremist commie on this issue . . . He assured the people I told that to that he didn\u2019t think I was a left-wing commie.\u201d\n\nMore from the chairman:\n\nOn Cotton: \u201c Some have a reputation of being tough on law enforcement and even though this legislation is tough on law enforcement as well as being fair because we do keep mandatory minimums, they just want to show that they\u2019re a purist.\u201d As for Cotton' whipping against the bill: \"It\u2019s not for show \u2014 he\u2019s doing what he actually believes in.\u201d\n\nSome have a reputation of being tough on law enforcement and even though this legislation is tough on law enforcement as well as being fair because we do keep mandatory minimums, they just want to show that they\u2019re a purist.\u201d \"It\u2019s not for show \u2014 he\u2019s doing what he actually believes in.\u201d More on Cotton: \u201c It\u2019s kind of ironic that a person that is so close to the president, as he is, that he would oppose it when the president says he supports what we have arrived at this week and in the end, the president wants it . . .

(Jose Sena Goulao/EPA-EFE)\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s New York Times, Ed Finn says that we worry too much about rogue machines. He worries that science fiction narratives about \u201ckiller robots\u201d are bad for us. In his description, \u201cthis is a dangerous way to think about A.I., because the stories we tell influence the decisions we make about how such systems should operate.\u201d\n\nBut is this true? Do these kinds of science fictional analogies and stories have consequences for how we think about serious policy issues? As it happens, we have new research on just this question \u2013 and it turns out the answers are more complicated.\n\nOur policy debates already draw on science fiction tropes.\n\nWe\u2019re not the first to ask whether science fiction change how citizens understand politics and the world? Daniel and Musgrave\u2019s new research, reported in the Monkey Cage, explains how this could be so. When we consume popular fiction \u2014 whether through movies or TV shows or novels \u2014 our brain experiences \u201csynthetic experiences\u201d that subsequently train us to think in slightly different ways. And some academic writings suggest that such understandings, when they enter the public discourse and get deployed by political actors, can enable political action more broadly. But this \u201cenabling effect\u201d has not really been tested, so we conducted a survey experiment to see whether this in fact happened. In our new paper, published in International Studies Quarterly, we ask: \u201cDoes Science Fiction Influence Political Fact?\u201d And if so, how? Here\u2019s what we found.\n\nTo find out how science fiction might affect public argument, we looked at the same political dispute mentioned in Finn\u2019s article: the policy debate over whether to ban autonomous weapons. It is true that political activists opposed to these weapons use images from popular culture to punch home their arguments: campaigners in favor of a treaty ban refer to the weapons as \u201ckiller robots,\u201d aiming to attract public attention to a complex issue. Also, the media has run with this trope, using images of the T-2000 on recent news articles about prospects for a UN treaty. But their opponents, who favor the development of such weapons, accuse them of using pop cultural notions to \u201cscaremonger\u201d the public into an unreasonable fear of emerging technologies From this perspective, which Finn seems to share, the public\u2019s concerns about autonomous weapons are a product of dystopian pop culture rather than political reality.\n\nBoth sides in this debate assume they know how Americans react to the insertion of such pop cultural themes into political discourse. But surprisingly, until now there has been little real foreign policy research on whether political narratives in fiction have any effect on public opinion or actual foreign policy.\n\nPop culture has consequences, but it\u2019s complicated\n\nWe found that the effects of killer robot images were more complicated than people might realize. It has consequences \u2014 but only when people are already steeped in science fiction. To figure this out, we asked a representative sample of 1,000 Americans which of a rash of hit Hollywood movies / franchises they had seen \u2014 including several films and TV shows featuring \u201ckiller robots.\u201d We asked half the group these questions before we asked them about their attitudes toward autonomous weapons, and half we asked after.\n\nThis allowed us to test whether attitudes changed when autonomous weapons were referred to as \u201ckiller robots.\u201d An earlier exploratory analysis found that people did not oppose autonomous weapons when they were framed in this way. We found the same thing, even when we applied statistical techniques to figure out if there was some other factor that was influencing public attitudes. This means that it\u2019s unlikely that campaigners\u2019 framing of autonomous weapons as killer robots is responsible for the high levels of public opposition to these weapons. Second, we tested whether being \u201cprimed\u201d with sci-fi \u2014 asked about the science fiction franchises before being asked about autonomous weapons \u2014 made a difference. Again, we found no significant effect.\n\nWhere we did find an important effect was in sci-fi consumption. People who reported that they had seen a lot of sci-fi films were more likely to oppose trends in autonomous weaponry. Their reaction was even stronger if they were \u201cprimed\u201d by getting the sci-fi questions in the survey first. However, this only happened with the most fluent science-fiction buffs in our sample, not for the overall population.\n\nWhat this suggests is that pop culture may sometimes matter \u2014 but not in the simple way that foreign policy analysts might expect. People vary in how they interpret the messages in film and TV shows. If our results are right, killer robot fiction doesn\u2019t have any significant effect on the general population. There is, however, a strong effect among the subculture of science fiction fans. The fact that they are only a small subset of the American population may explain why only a few people in our open-ended survey refer to science fiction as a reason to fear the outsourcing of kill decisions to machines. Instead respondents emphasize a variety of philosophical, normative and tactical fears, which are described in the wordcloud below:\n\nThis leads us to think that the widespread anti-killer-robot sentiment among Americans is driven more by legitimate fears over the weapons themselves than by activist\u2019s scaremongering language. While references to \u201c\u2018Terminator\u201d may be ubiquitous in popular culture, for these narratives to inform foreign policy attitudes, one needs a deep immersion in science fiction, not just a superficial exposure to killer robot memes.\n\nMore broadly, it may be that pop culture doesn\u2019t actually have much of an impact on actual foreign policy attitudes. Movies about evil artificial intelligence are certainly fun to watch, and even to write about. However, it isn\u2019t clear that they have large-scale consequences for the way that people think about technology. They may influence the ideas of fans like Finn (and us!) but they don\u2019t have measurable effects on the rest of the population. And if the U.S. population is nervous about outsourcing kill decisions to machines, it might have to do with something other than killer robot movies.\n\nCharli Carpenter is a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n\nKevin L.

Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Friday): Keep an eye out for slick spots early, just in case. We should be mostly or fully dry during the day, but an early shower isn\u2019t impossible. Northwesterly winds could gust near 25 mph in the morning, but they slowly die down. It\u2019s sunny most of the time, but afternoon high temperatures in the mid- to upper 40s could feel a bit nippier with wind chill considered. Confidence: Medium\n\nTonight: Breezes decrease another notch, to about 5 mph out of the west. Skies should stay mostly clear, allowing 20s for low temperatures well outside of the Beltway, with mid-30s likely downtown. If you still have snow around your town, you could end up being one of the colder spots. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast into next week...\n\nTomorrow (Saturday): Sunshine should prevail over any periodic clouds. Breezes remain light out of the west. This should allow afternoon high temperatures ranging in the mid-40s to about 50 degrees to actually feel close to that \u2014 thanks to the lack of wind chill. Our bodies are slowly acclimating to these below-average temperatures, so it shouldn\u2019t feel quite so biting as it would have a week ago. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Conditions look fairly calm and clear for the evening hours, so temperatures may fall quickly toward the mid-20s to mid-30s (downtown). Clouds move in after midnight, potentially slowing or halting this fall in temperatures. Think of clouds as an insulating blanket over us. We\u2019ll watch if winds or clouds change this forecast slightly, as we get closer. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSunday: Some clouds could move into the picture, but I think our dry streak may continue, as well as our below-average temperatures. At least mid-40s to about 50 degrees won\u2019t have much, or any, wind chill factor \u2014 at least as it appears so far. Note these high temperatures are about 10 degrees below where we should be this time of year. Confidence: Medium\n\nSunday night: Clouds could hang around, helping to buoy temperatures a bit. A range of mid-30s to about 40 degrees appears probable, with the warmest spots being downtown. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nSlightly more sun than clouds and still fairly chilly Monday into Tuesday. Mid-40s to about 50 degrees continues to be close to our recent temperature range.

(Altaf Qadri/AP)\n\nWhen Deepikah Bhardwaj was a child in New Delhi, she would look forward to the arrival of the Indian winter. The mornings would become chilly and crisp, while evenings were pleasantly cool. But in recent years, that sense of anticipation turned to dread.\n\nWith falling temperatures came a thick smog, leaving her short of breath and afraid to go outside. After her son was born in 2016, she decided it was time to act. These days, when she thinks of Delhi, her main emotion is relief at having escaped.\n\n\u201cI feel bad that I cannot go back to my home city, ever,\u201d said Bhardwaj, 33, sitting in her light-filled apartment in the state of Goa on India\u2019s western coast, more than 1,000 miles from Delhi. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of permanent loss, like a friend who didn\u2019t say goodbye.\u201d\n\nBhardwaj is part of a small but growing contingent of what might be called pollution refugees: people who have decided that the only way to cope with Delhi\u2019s staggering pollution is to run from it. Some, like Bhardwaj, have left the Indian capital for Goa, while others have decamped for Bangalore, Mumbai or even Canada.\n\nThe phenomenon appears limited to an elite few \u2014 a trickle in comparison to the influx of people who arrive in Delhi every day in search of economic opportunity. But the departures pose a pointed rebuke to the city\u2019s expanding ambitions: How great is a city if its air causes some of the people who live there to flee?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, Delhi has the most polluted air of any major metropolis in the world. The causes are multiple \u2014 vehicle exhaust, construction dust, industrial emissions, crop burning in nearby states \u2014 and exacerbated by geographic factors.\n\n\n\nA heap of garbage is set on fire in New Delhi. (Altaf Qadri/AP)\n\nThe \u201cpollution season\u201d in greater Delhi, home to 29 million people, begins in October and persists for months. November and December bring the worst readings of the year: Last week, the level of the particulate matter considered most harmful to human health spiked for several hours to more than 40 times the level recommended by the WHO before receding. Such particles can lodge deep within the lungs and have been linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, respiratory infections and even cancer.\n\nThose who can afford it do what they can to mitigate their exposure. They acquire face masks, buy air purifiers for their homes and plan trips outside the city with their children during school vacations. But for some in Delhi, such measures are inadequate at best. And they are willing to make difficult choices \u2014 such as quitting jobs and leaving behind family and friends \u2014 in search of cleaner air.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a national emergency,\u201d said Mayur Sharma, the co-host of a popular food program who was born and raised in Delhi but left the city for good last year with his family. \u201cThe more we learned, the more scared we got.\u201d\n\nSharma said that if his son ran around outside on autumn days, he would have difficulty breathing at night, requiring him to use a nebulizer. One afternoon two years ago, Sharma and his wife, Michelle Cornman, found themselves observing a surreal scene \u2014 a lavish outdoor children\u2019s birthday party where all the kids were wearing pollution masks \u2014 and decided it was time to leave.\n\nTheir destination was a place they had visited on vacations: Goa, a tiny state popular for its beaches, coconut trees and relaxed pace of life. Now the family lives at the end of a quiet street in the Goan town of Porvorim. Their home sits next to a jungle, and they leave their windows open.\n\n\u201cYou do feel like a defector,\u201d said Cornman, 42, who spent a decade in Delhi. She said the couple tends not to discuss their decision or their new life with people back in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to tell our friends, \u201cHey, it\u2019s beautiful today, we went to the beach.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor Tracy Shilshi, the breaking point came last November after the Hindu festival of Diwali. The holiday is often celebrated by setting off firecrackers, which adds another element to Delhi\u2019s toxic mix of pollution. \u201cIt got so bad you could literally feel the smog in your mouth,\u201d said Shilshi, 37. On Facebook, she posted a plaintive poem about Delhi\u2019s pollution by an unknown author.\n\nShilshi\u2019s 3-year-old son had a constant runny nose, which her pediatrician attributed to Delhi\u2019s air, while her father struggled with an ever-present cough. So after 25 years in the city, Shilshi quit her job as a television journalist and moved in April with her husband, children and parents to the southern part of Goa. Her son\u2019s nasal issues cleared up within a week, as did her father\u2019s cough. The air purifiers they once used in Delhi are now gathering dust in boxes.\n\n\n\nBhardwaj, an artist from New Delhi, created posters to raise awareness of the city\u2019s pollution problem. She fled the city, too. (Deepikah Bhardwaj)\n\nMovers and headhunters confirm that people are leaving because of the bad air, even if they say they can\u2019t quantify the trend. Suresh Raina, a partner at the search firm Hunt Partners, said that the winter has become an opportune time to persuade executives who do not have deep roots in Delhi to accept jobs in other cities. Such executives wake up \u201cevery November when the pollution deepens and the sky outside becomes darker, and they start making calls, saying, \u2018I\u2019m not staying here,\u2019 \u201d Raina said.\n\nShiivani Aggarwal, chief executive of the Formula Group, a relocation specialist, said she had encountered several examples of pollution driving people out: One family moved to Hyderabad last year after their young child had trouble breathing in Delhi; another couple arrived in Delhi from Mumbai two months ago but is already looking to leave because of the pollution; a third couple decided to live apart \u2014 he in Delhi, she in Goa \u2014 because of the bad air.\n\nAbout a month ago, Aggarwal said, her own husband even raised the idea of leaving. They\u2019re not going anywhere for now.\n\n\u201cThis kind of migration out for people who can afford it, I think it\u2019s right at the beginning,\u201d said Vindhya Tripathi, a self-described pollution refugee living in Goa. She and her two children left Delhi last December after ruminating about a move for years; her husband still works in the city and flies down on weekends.\n\nHer home sits on a hill above the Mapusa River with a view of a wide green valley. \u201cI would like to believe that things will change\u201d in Delhi, said Tripathi, 39. But such change is \u201cdefinitely not going to happen in the next five years, while my children are children.\u201d\n\nOthers are more hopeful. It may take a half a decade or more for the air to improve, but \u201cthere\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be done,\u201d said Mrida Joshi, 37, as she sat on the veranda of her home in a small Goan village.\n\nDusk was falling and her 3-year old twin daughters were running around barefoot. Joshi left Delhi in September and plans to remain in Goa until March, when the pollution in the capital eases somewhat. Delhi \u201chas a great vibe, I love it, it\u2019s home,\u201d she said, but \u201cI cannot live in denial.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nIndia is trying to prevent apocalyptic air pollution.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)\n\nLaw enforcement in Northern California is engaged in one of the largest search-and-rescue missions in state history, picking through the charred remnants of the Camp Fire that tore through the region starting last week. At least 63 people have been reported dead, and another 631 are missing, The Washington Post reported Thursday.\n\nBut in the middle of the logistical challenges involved with the cleanup and evacuation, on Thursday, deputies were involved in a car chase and the fatal shooting of a felon wanted for skipping parole, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said. The man was unarmed, the Redding Record Searchlight reported. The episode unfolded within the evacuation zone in Butte County, Calif., one of the region\u2019s hit hardest by the conflagration.\n\nAuthorities have yet to release the name of the 48-year-old man who was killed. However, Ramsey detailed the encounter to reporters Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cWe had an officer-involved shooting,\u201d he solemnly said at the start of his comments.\n\nThe incident began around 11 a.m. on Thursday in the parking lot of the Pines Yankee Hill Hardware store, a mom-and-pop outlet off Highway 70 pressed against a nearby hillside. A Butte County Sheriff deputy was patrolling the area when a person reported that a car had been parked in the store\u2019s lot for the past three days. The deputy arrived and noticed a sedan jammed with living supplies in the lot. A man appeared to be sleeping in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cIt appeared he was living in his car,\u201d Ramsey said.\n\nWhen the deputy ran the car\u2019s information, the system spat back out some troubling details.\n\n\u201cThe license plate came back to a subject that was well known to the sheriff\u2019s office as an armed and dangerous wanted parolee,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cHe was also wanted in a double homicide that occurred in December 2014.\u201d\n\nThe man was from Berry Creek, Calif., Ramsey said. In 2014, police had executed a search warrant on his property and discovered a shotgun, handgun and pipe bomb on the premises. That same week, he was arrested at a local store, Ramsey said. The man was heavily armed: Under a heavy jacket, he had an AK-47 assault rifle, a pistol, handgun, revolver, dagger and brass knuckles.\n\nThe man was convicted of possession of a destructive device and possession of methamphetamine, Ramsey said. In 2016, he was sentenced to seven years in prison. He was paroled in May 2018 but disappeared two months later. \u201cHe went missing from his parole. He was then known as a parolee at large and has been sought since,\u201d Ramsey said.\n\nOn Thursday morning, considering the man\u2019s history of being armed, the deputy radioed for backup. Law enforcement from several agencies responded to the parking lot. Together, they surrounded the sedan.\n\nA deputy knocked on the window. The man awoke, jammed his hand into his right pocket, \u201cas if he was reaching for a weapon,\u201d Ramsey said. The deputies pulled their weapons and stepped back.\n\n\u201cYou guys should have let me alone,\u201d the man yelled, according to Ramsey. \u201cI\u2019m not going back.\u201d\n\nThe driver then snapped on his ignition and raced out of the parking lot, Ramsey said. Law enforcement pursued. The car chase shot south on Highway 70 at 90 mph. Deputies radioed ahead, and spike strips were laid down on the roadside. The sedan\u2019s tires flattened on impact, but the car continued to grind down the highway for another half-mile, Ramsey said.\n\n\u201cWhen it stopped, the officers came,\u201d he said. \u201cThey yelled at the man to get out of the car. He at first refused, then got out.\u201d\n\nThe man emerged from his car with his right hand still in his pocket. After he refused to pull out the hand, a deputy from the Sutter County Sheriff\u2019s office released a police K-9 named Bandit, Ramsey said.\n\n\u201cBandit was doing his job in attempting to stop the man,\u201d Ramsey said. The man then pulled out a metallic object and pointed it at the law enforcement members, Ramsey said.\n\nSix officers opened fire \u2014 two with handguns, four with rifles. The hail of bullets hit the man and Bandit, Ramsey said.\n\nBandit continued to try to bring the man down, and a pit bull from the subject\u2019s car came out and attacked Bandit,\u201d the district attorney added. A seventh deputy shot the pit bull. \u201c[Bandit] was pronounced dead ... as was the subject, as was the pit bull,\u201d Ramsey said.\n\nRamsey\u2019s office is handling the investigation into the shooting. According to the Redding Record Searchlight, deputies from Butte and Shasta counties were involved in the gunfire, as well as a Fish and Wildlife warden.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nU.K. school bans pricey Canada Goose jackets in effort at \u2018poverty-proofing\u2019\n\nA rogue turkey that can\u2019t be captured has become the unofficial \u2018mayor\u2019 of Ashwaubenon, Wis.\n\nAmerican traveler missing in Mexico was killed by Sinaloa cartel, officials say"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Ex-minister Lieberman: Israel-Hamas truce a 'capitulation'", "description": "Israel's outgoing defense minister: Netanyahu's decision to accept informal truce with Hamas 'capitulation to terrorism'", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/ex-minister-lieberman-israel-hamas-truce-a-capitulation/2018/11/16/87ea96d8-e981-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T09:25:18Z", "content": "JERUSALEM Israels outgoing defense minister says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus decision to accept an informal truce with Gazas Hamas rulers amounts to utter capitulation to terrorism.

(Tsafrir Abayov/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel moved closer to early elections Friday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s main coalition partner, the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home party, said it wants a vote \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d and will press for consultations on a date on Sunday.\n\nThe call for early elections came after a meeting Friday between Netanyahu and Education Minister and Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett. The two men have been locked in a tense rivalry, with Bennett often criticizing Netanyahu from the right.\n\nBennett had demanded the post of defense minister, after the incumbent, Avigdor Lieberman, resigned earlier this week in protest over Netanyahu\u2019s Gaza policies.\n\nA senior Jewish Home official said it became clear after the Bennett-Netanyahu meeting that there \u201cis a need to go to elections as soon as possible.\u201d He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing the content of a closed meeting.\n\nThe official said leaders of coalition parties will meet Sunday to coordinate the date for early elections.\n\nThe apparent failure of the Netanyahu-Bennett meeting seemed to seal the coalition\u2019s fate.\n\nThe departure of Lieberman and his Israel Beitenu party had left the coalition with a one-seat majority in the 120-member parliament. Without Bennett\u2019s Jewish Home, Netanyahu\u2019s coalition would lose its parliamentary majority.\n\nThe political crisis began with a botched Israeli undercover raid in Gaza on Sunday. The raid led to two days of intense cross-border fighting. Gaza\u2019s Hamas rulers fired hundreds of rockets at southern Israel, while Israeli warplanes targeted scores of targets in Gaza.\n\nAfter two days, Egypt brokered an informal truce between Israel and the Islamic militant Hamas. Netanyahu averted a war, but drew blistering criticism from ultra-nationalists.\n\nLieberman resigned in protest on Wednesday.\n\nOn Friday, he toured southern Israel and accused Netanyahu of being soft on terrorism. He said Netanyahu\u2019s Gaza policy is strengthening Hamas.\n\nLieberman alleged that the truce will put southern Israel under a growing threat from Hamas, similar to the threat posed to northern Israel by Lebanon\u2019s heavily armed Hezbollah militia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible that after Hamas launches 500 rockets at the Israeli border communities. the heads of Hamas are actually getting immunity from the Israeli cabinet,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe are now feeding a monster\u201d that will only grow if not stopped, he said. \u201cWithin a year we will have a twin brother of Hezbollah, with all the implications.\u201d\n\nBut on Friday, Hamas kept border protests widely restrained.\n\nThousands of Palestinians participated in a Hamas-led rally along the perimeter fence dividing Gaza from Israel, with most crowds staying 300 meters from the fence.\n\nHowever, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said 40 Palestinians were wounded, 18 by live fire from Israeli forces. Witnesses said others were wounded in stone-throwing incidents at the usual five protest locations.\n\nNo tire burnings or attempts to breach the fence were reported. Such acts have often triggered lethal Israeli army fire. Since the near-weekly protests began in March, more than 170 Palestinians have been killed.\n\nHamas is pressing for an end to an Israeli-Egyptian blockade that beleaguered Gaza\u2019s 2 million residents since the Islamic group took full power there in 2007.\n\nPrior to the Israeli commando raid that went awry, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million as a first installment to help Hamas pay civil servants long overdue salaries. The move was seen as an attempt to defuse tension, but Lieberman also criticized it as yet another measure that will strengthen Hamas.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She gave the speech at an event in support of Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m telling the truth, I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. \u201cI was anxious about giving it.

Or replaced by a wooden cross. Or a new plaque on a rock. Or fresh tiles. Or just a circle of bare earth.\n\nAs elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, the likeness of Bolshevik leader Lenin remained the focal point of hundreds of towns and villages for years in Ukraine after Communism\u2019s demise.\n\nThen came the protests, starting in November 2013, that toppled Ukraine\u2019s Moscow-friendly government \u2014 touching off Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, the war in eastern Ukraine and a race by the new authorities in Kiev to erase all vestiges of Soviet rule.\n\nThe ensuing \u201cdecommunization\u201d laws spelled out scores of historical figures, mottos and symbols to be deleted from public spaces.

One exception: monuments near the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\nWhat remains, he acknowledges, are hundreds of empty spaces and pedestals, often in towns\u2019 central squares. In the institute\u2019s internal jargon, the vacancies are known as \u201cstumps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is, the question of how to fill these spaces will remain the subject of discussion among Ukrainians for some time,\u201d Viatrovych said. \u201cOur views of our history are still being formed.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s search for new symbols to replace its Lenins reflects the country\u2019s larger struggle to reorient itself toward the West amid economic turbulence and the continuing war with Russian-backed separatists in the east.\n\nUkraine\u2019s rapid push also draws parallels to other pressing debates around the world on how to deal with history and memory \u2014 such as whether to preserve statues of Confederate figures in the United States or reinterpreting Columbus Day to acknowledge the decimation of Native Americans by European settlement.\n\nGovernment proponents say Ukraine needs to free itself from Russia\u2019s sway by embracing and developing a national narrative and national heroes. Critics say that the government is ceding too much power to far-right nationalist groups and enforcing an official ideology just as the Soviets did.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a condemnation of propaganda, but it\u2019s the exchange of one propaganda for another,\u201d said Ievgeniia Moliar, a Kiev activist and art historian critical of the government\u2019s hard-line approach to decommunization.

But the push to remove the rest after the 2014 revolution was remarkable in its legally mandated scale and speed.\n\nMoliar, who has tracked Lenin replacements across the nation, says the most common genres are the religious and the patriotic. \ufeff\n\nIn the central Ukrainian city of Bila Tserkva, frozen-dumplings magnate Liudmyla Drygalo thought of both. She and fellow activists created a makeshift memorial to Ukrainians who died in the 2014 protests and the war in the east and erected a wooden cross to stand in Lenin\u2019s place.\n\nThe square was always a central gathering place, Drygalo said. By exchanging Lenin for a cross, she said, \u201cWe kept this tradition and simply swapped out the symbol for one that would be close to everyone\u2019s heart.\u201d\n\n[Far from former Soviet Union, a place where a communist can still dream]\n\n\n\nA rock with a plaque honoring Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine's national poet, stands as a replacement to a Lenin bust.

In Kiev, a tall black pedestal that says \u201cLenin\u201d still overlooks one of the city\u2019s central squares. The figure on top was toppled amid the 2013 protests, but the stone pedestal proved more difficult to move.

Several opposition lawmakers and policemen were wounded.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a political crisis since Oct. 26, when President Maithripala Sirisena abruptly sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and appointed Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe says he still has the support of a majority in Parliament.\n\nJayasuriya, using a microphone, conducted the proceedings while standing on the floor of Parliament, which for the second time passed a no-confidence motion against Rajapaksa and his government by a voice vote.\n\nJayasuriya first offered to take the vote by name, but was unable to do so because of the commotion and opted for a voice vote. He then adjourned the house until Monday.\n\nLawmakers loyal to Rajapaksa hooted and continued to hurl abuse at Jayasuriya until he left the chamber. Arundika Fernando, a lawmaker allied with Rajapaksa, sat in the speaker\u2019s chair while others shouted slogans.\n\nIn a tweet, Sirisena vowed not to dissolve Parliament and called upon \u201call parties to uphold principles of democracy and parliamentary traditions at all times.\u201d\n\nSirisena dissolved Parliament a week ago and ordered new elections, but the Supreme Court on Tuesday suspended Sirisena\u2019s directive.\n\nOpposition lawmaker R.

He also insisted the speaker had no authority to remove him and said he is continuing in his role as prime minister.\n\nRajapaksa, a former president, is considered a hero by some in the ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending a long civil war by crushing ethnic Tamil Tiger rebels. However, his time in power was marred by allegations of wartime atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In several clips, they can be seen wiping down sinks, coffee cups and glasses with the same used towel. One wipes a glass with the bottom edge of her cleaning uniform.\n\nAn activist blogger who uses the pseudonym \u201cHuazong\u201d posted the video late Wednesday on his verified account on Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter. He calls the problem long-standing and widespread, and writes that he spent 2,000 nights at 147 hotels over six years. The video has been viewed more than 30 million times.\n\nState broadcaster CCTV aired video of uniformed inspectors at an unidentified hotel flashing their ID cards and holding a drinking glass up to the light to inspect it.\n\nThe Peninsula hotel in Beijing said Friday that city food and drug administration officials had conducted an on-site examination of cups the previous day and found them cleaner than standards required. The cups were sent for further tests, the hotel said in a statement on its Weibo account.\n\n\u201cThe hotel will still take measures to strengthen the implementation of the standard procedures for room service staff to ensure all aspects meet the established standards of the Peninsula,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe Shangri-La Hotel in Fuzhou said the actions in the video violate its hygiene standards, while the Park Hyatt in Beijing called it an isolated occurrence.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Aaron Favila/Associated Press)\n\nPORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea \u2014 A ubiquitous sight in Papua New Guinea\u2019s capital is men, women and children chewing betel nut combined with slaked lime and mustard bean, turning lips, teeth and tongue a dark red, and producing a mild high.\n\nAlong with drinking alcohol in public, chewing betel nut and spitting out the messy remains has been aggressively discouraged in Port Moresby this year. It\u2019s part attempt to clean up the coastal city of 300,000 as world leaders briefly descend on it for a Pacific Rim summit this weekend and part the latest episode of an ongoing struggle to control betel nut after previous attempts to completely ban it in the city caused chaos.\n\nPrime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill wants Papua New Guinea, one of the least urbanized countries in the world, to present its best face for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. Faces with red lips and stained teeth are not part of that vision.\n\nAt the Koki Buai market, more than two dozen vendors laid out mounds of the green betel palm fruit and small piles of mustard beans as an excited crowd was kept under control by threats and admonishments from heavies, some wielding bits of wood, employed to keep order.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that APEC has come to PNG and I\u2019m happy the leaders are here, everyone from other countries,\u201d said vendor Rodney Pupu. \u201cI want to welcome all of you.\u201d\n\nThe market is one of several set up in Port Moresby over the past several years as a compromise that allows the trade in \u201cgreen gold\u201d to continue.\n\nChewing betel nut has deep cultural roots in Papua New Guinea\u2019s tribal societies but in the capital has morphed into addiction and lucrative business. Medical experts says prolonged use causes oral cancer.\n\nA total ban imposed in Port Moresby in 2013 spiraled into conflict that caused deaths and property damage and deprived thousands of people of livelihoods, development economist Busa Jeremiah Wenogo wrote in a blog. Another total ban was threatened earlier this year but was wound back after tear gas fired by police to disperse vendors drifted into a school, Wenogo said. There were also allegations police stripped vendors naked as a form of punishment.\n\nThe current solution \u2014 designated markets \u2014 also has its problems because of cramped conditions and confrontations between rival factions, he said.\n\nAt Koki Buai, handfuls of the fruit were selling for 2-5 kina (60 cents to $3) and mustard beans for 1-2 kina. Pupu said he can make 1,000 kina ($300) in a week and double that if a rugby match \u2014 a national obsession \u2014 is happening in the town.\n\nBefore the market, which some of the vendors credited the minister for APEC Justin Tkatchenko with setting up, Pupu said selling was a cat-and-mouse game with police.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the high cost of hosting the summit and controversies such as the import of 40 luxury Maserati cars to transport VIPs, Pupu deferred to the market\u2019s boss, a feisty woman hovering nearby.\n\nAnother man, John Simage, interjected.\n\n\u201cI strongly disagree that the government decided to take so much money and buy the Maseratis when we actually have cars in Papua New Guinea that we could use to transport delegates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have saved that money to bring further development to the country.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s been called Papua New Guinea\u2019s global coming-out party has caused both pride and discord and underlined the yawning gulf between a small well-educated minority and the poor, who include the 85 percent of people living in the highlands and other remote areas.\n\nCity social services worker Tony Sari said the country needs development but also acknowledged that the summit expenses were unpopular outside the capital, where basic public services such as health and education are limited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like living. You have good days and bad days,\u201d he said, weighing up the pros and cons.\n\nIt was clear, Sari said, that the overhaul of Port Moresby has made an impact.\n\nWhen he travels in his National Capital District Commission vehicle, people sometimes shout \u201cAPEC! APEC!\u201d he said, amused to find himself getting credit.\n\nAt a busy supermarket, 21-year-old groceries bagger Catherine Lapsie said she was \u201creally happy\u201d her small country is getting attention.\n\nThe restrictions on public drinking and betel nut chewing could change behavior for the better, she said, but was also afraid of what might happen once the foreign dignitaries leave.\n\n\u201cI feel something terrible will happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said after the APEC meeting, something will go on,\u201d Lapsie said, grimacing while trying to explain her fears in English.\n\nSwitching to a local language, she explained that more tourists might come and prices increase, making life more difficult for ordinary Papua New Guineans.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The golf ball-sized metal cylinder at the heart of the world\u2019s system for measuring mass is heading into retirement. Gathering this week in Versailles, west of Paris, governments on Friday Nov. 16, 2018, are expected to approve a plan to instead use a scientific formula to define the exact weight of a kilo. (Christophe Ena/Associated Press)\n\nVERSAILLES, France \u2014 In a historic vote, more than 50 nations unanimously approved an overhaul of the international measurement system that underpins global trade and other human endeavors, uniting Friday behind new definitions for the kilogram and other units in a way they fail to do on many other issues.\n\nScientists, for whom the update represented decades of work, clapped, cheered and even wept as delegates gathered in Versailles one by one said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201coui\u201d to the change, hailed as a revolution in how humanity measures and quantifies its world.\n\nThe redefinition of the kilogram, the globally approved unit of mass, was the mostly hotly anticipated change. For more than a century, the kilogram has been defined as the mass of a cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy kept in a high-security vault in France. That artefact, nicknamed \u201cLe Grand K,\u201d has been the world\u2019s sole true kilogram since 1889 .\n\nNow, with the vote, the kilogram and all of the other main measurement units will be defined using numerical values that fit handily onto a wallet card. Those numbers were read to the national delegates before they voted. The update will take effect May 20.\n\nScientists at the meeting were giddy with excitement: some even sported tattoos on their forearms that celebrated the science.\n\nNobel prize winner William Phillips called the update \u201cthe greatest revolution in measurement since the French revolution,\u201d which ushered in the metric system of meters and kilograms.\n\nThe Grand K and its six official copies, kept together in the same safe on the outskirts of Paris and collectively known as the \u201cheir and the spares,\u201d will be retired but not forgotten. Scientists want to keep studying them to see whether their masses change over time.\n\nThe update will have no discernable impact for most people. Bathroom scales won\u2019t suddenly get kinder and kilos and grams won\u2019t change in supermarkets.\n\nBut the new formula-based definition for the kilogram will have multiple advantages over the precision-crafted metal lump that set the standard from the 19th century to the 21st, through periods of stunning human achievement and stunning follies, including two world wars.\n\nUnlike a physical object, the formula for the kilo, now also known as \u201cthe electric kilo,\u201d cannot pick up particles of dust, decay with time or be dropped and damaged, but will be easier to share.\n\n\u201cIf we stay where we are, and someone did accidentally drop the kilogram or if there was a contamination that we couldn\u2019t control, then the whole system has got no head. We\u2019re in chaos,\u201d said Barry Inglis, a scientist from Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that\u2019s really been worrying us, I think, for maybe 15 years or more is just how vulnerable the system is, by depending just on that one little piece of platinum-iridium.\u201d\n\nThe redefined kilo is expected to allow for more accurate measurements of very, very small or very, very large masses and help usher in innovations in science, industry, climate study and other fields. In humankind\u2019s efforts to quantify and understand the world, stretching back centuries to when ancient Babylonians measured mass with stones, the vote marked a major milestone, scientists agreed.\n\n\u201cThose units, those constants chosen now, include everything we know, everything we have always known and provide that springboard for us to go pursue those things that we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Jon Pratt of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. He said Friday\u2019s gathering \u201cwas just leaving me in a puddle of tears.\u201d\n\nUpdated definitions for the ampere, kelvin and mole also were approved Friday.\n\nHumanity uses seven main measurements units: the meter for length, the kilogram for mass, the second for time, the ampere for electric current, the kelvin for temperature, the mole for the amount of a substance and the candela for luminous intensity.\n\nOf the seven, the kilo was the last still based on a physical artefact, Le Grand K. With time, as the science behind the new kilo definition becomes more accessible and affordable, the update should also mean that countries won\u2019t have to send their own kilograms back to France to be checked occasionally against Le Grand K, as they have done until now, to see whether their mass was still accurate.\n\n\u201cWe future-proofed the system,\u201d said Martin Milton, director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.\n\nThe bureau is the guardian of the system, as well as of Le Grand K and its copies, which are stored in a vault that requires three keys, kept by three different people, to unlock. Very rarely have they seen the light of day.\n\n\u201cWe put in place a system that doesn\u2019t depend on something that is 140 years old,\u201d Milton said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Glenn Campbell/Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nSYDNEY \u2014 Shinzo Abe became the first prime minister of Japan to visit Darwin since the northern Australian city was bombed by Japanese forces in World War II, as he and his Australian counterpart spoke Friday of strengthening defense and other ties between their countries.\n\nAbe\u2019s one-night stay was described by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as a deeply symbolic one. It was also another chance for Japan and Australia to present a united front as regional partners in the Asia-Pacific amid ongoing concerns of spreading Chinese influence, including the country\u2019s building of islands in the disputed South China Sea.\n\n\u201cAustralia and Japan also stand united on the importance of resolving disputes in the South China Sea, peacefully and in accordance with international law, and we are strongly opposed to any actions that could increase tensions within the region,\u201d Morrison said., reading from a prepared statement after meeting Abe.\n\nHe added that a \u201cstable and secure regional maritime ... order is central to both Australia and Japan\u2019s visions for the region, and is underpinned by respect for international law.\u201d\n\nMorrison also said he looked forward to increased cooperation with Japan to support regional maritime safety and security. The leaders said they hope to conclude early next year an agreement on increased defense links, including more joint military exercises.\n\nAbe said Japan and Australian would promote cooperation to strengthen the rule of law at sea. They also agreed to promote cooperation in providing building assistance for maritime security-related projects in Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations.\n\nThe two leaders reiterated their commitment to the denuclearization of North Korea, while Abe also praised Australia\u2019s role in a revamped Pacific Rim free-trade agreement that President Donald Trump had pulled the U.S. out of. It comes into effect later this year.\n\n\u201cDarwin, connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans, is a crucial place for the stability and prosperity of the whole of the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Abe said. \u201cIt is at this very place where Prime Minister Morrison and I confirmed our commitment to further deepen this special strategic partnership between Japan and Australia, in pursuit of our common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d\n\nAbe arrived for his visit Friday afternoon and immediately went to lay a wreath with Morrison at the city\u2019s main war memorial. Abe then stood solemnly with head bowed as an army bugler played \u201cThe Last Post.\u201d\n\nThe visit continues Abe\u2019s moves to show remorse for Japan\u2019s role in the war, following his trip to Pearl Harbor in 2016.\n\n\u201cDarwin was once the place where the former Japanese forces conducted their first air bombing against Australia, leading to much sacrifice,\u201d Abe said. \u201cAt the war memorial, I extended my condolences in honor of all the foreign soldiers, and renewed my vow towards peace.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Abe will honor his country\u2019s war dead, visiting the memorial of the 80-crew Japanese submarine I-124, which was sunk off Darwin in January 1942.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But there were many other dubious statements in his lengthy interview, some of which we have fact-checked as part of our database on Trump\u2019s false and misleading claims. Here\u2019s a quick roundup of the president\u2019s most notable errors of fact, in the order in which he made them.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s very interesting, because when you talk about not Senate confirmed, well, [special counsel Robert] Mueller\u2019s not Senate confirmed. He\u2019s heading this whole big thing; he\u2019s not Senate confirmed.\u201d\n\nTrump is responding to assertions that he violated the Constitution by appointing the Justice Department\u2019s chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker, as acting attorney general. The chief of staff post is not subject to Senate confirmation, unlike the deputy attorney general, who ordinarily would fill the vacancy.\n\nBut there is no expectation that a special counsel would be subject to Senate confirmation, as he is an \u201cinferior officer\u201d who reports to someone who has been confirmed. (The former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had recused himself, so Mueller previously had reported to the deputy attorney general.)\n\nIn other words, Trump\u2019s point is nonsensical.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m building the wall in smaller stages, and we moved the military there, we put up barbed wire, we did all sorts of things.\u201d\n\nNo, Trump\u2019s wall is not yet being built. Congress inserted specific language in its appropriations bill that none of the $1.57 billion appropriated for border protection may be used for prototypes of a concrete wall that Trump observed while in California. The money can be used only for bollard fencing and levee fencing. Trump regularly makes this false claim \u2014 at last count, more than 80 times.\n\n\u201cYou have 17 people \u2014 half, many of them worked for Hillary Clinton, some on the foundation. The Hillary Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nThis is false, as we have documented previously. Five members of the Mueller team contributed to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. One of those people, attorney Jeannie Rhee, represented the Clinton Foundation in a 2015 lawsuit over Clinton\u2019s use of her private email server. Aaron Zebley, a former counterterrorism FBI agent and assistant U.S. attorney, made no contributions to Clinton but represented a Clinton aide at one point.\n\nIn other words, no member of the Mueller team worked for Hillary Clinton and only one had a connection to the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really, you know, terminated a lot of the Obamacare, as it was referred to.\u201d\n\nThe 2017 Trump tax bill, starting in 2019, effectively eliminates the mandate that required people to pay a penalty if they chose not to buy health insurance. (A waiver was available for people under a certain income level.) The penalty must still be paid in 2017 and 2018.\n\nOther than the individual mandate, Trump has not \u201cterminated a lot of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a problem in California that\u2019s so bad of illegals voting. This is a California problem, and if you notice, almost every race \u2014 I was watching today \u2014 out of like 11 races that are in question, they\u2019re going to win all of them. The Republicans don\u2019t win, and that\u2019s because of potentially illegal votes, which is what I\u2019ve been saying for a long time.\u201d\n\nTrump, without evidence, suggests that the slow process of counting California\u2019s mail-in ballots means that undocumented immigrants are casting votes. He has never given an explanation as to why the late votes that are counted would be from undocumented immigrants. There is no evidence that undocumented immigrants are voting in California in vast numbers, let alone enough to swing an election.\n\nVoter fraud is extremely rare, though obviously errors can be made. California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles acknowledged in October that 1,500 people may have been incorrectly registered because of a processing error \u2014 including at least one noncitizen (a legal resident, not an undocumented immigrant). The incorrect registrations were canceled before the election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019ve had friends talk about it when people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It\u2019s really a disgrace, what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nTrump claims he has seen this sort of voter fraud. We highly doubt it. Perhaps it came in a dream?\n\nAt least 34 states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. So not only would a fraudster need a new hat and shirt, but also phony IDs that match records of registered voters. It is difficult to imagine how such a scheme could be implemented on a vast scale.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what happened in New Hampshire, where thousands of people came up and voted from a very liberal part of Massachusetts, and they came up in buses and they voted. I said, \u2018What\u2019s going on over here?\u2019 My people said, \u2018You won New Hampshire easily, except they have tremendous numbers of buses coming up.\u2019 They\u2019re pouring up by the hundreds, buses of people getting out, voting. Then they\u2019re supposed to go back within 90 days. And of the people that are supposed to go back, almost none of them do. In other words, they go back after the vote is over. They go back \u2014 and I think it\u2019s like 3 percent \u2014 I mean, almost nobody goes back to show that, you know, that they were allowed to vote.\u201d\n\nThis is another fantasy that has been repeatedly debunked. The New Hampshire attorney general\u2019s office investigated this claim after complaints of out-of-state busing in 2014 and found no evidence that out-of-state voters were ever bused into the state to shift the outcome. Instead, some colleges in the state had hired out-of-state buses to help ferry college students to the polls. In other words, the bus company might have been from Vermont, but not the voters on the bus. After the state asked that in-state buses be used, there were no complaints in 2016 \u2014 except from the Trump White House after the president narrowly lost the state to Clinton.\n\nWhen Trump aide Stephen Miller made a similar claim in 2017, Tom Rath, a former New Hampshire attorney general and prominent Republican in the state, tweeted this after Miller\u2019s comments:\n\nLet me as be unequivocal as possible-allegations of voter fraud in NH are baseless,without any merit-it's shameful to spread these fantasies \u2014 Tom Rath (@polguru) February 12, 2017\n\n\u201cIn fact, they say in 80 years, I think, the presidential party\u2019s only picked up two Senate seats, I picked up three. I mean, assuming that they don\u2019t do any further shenanigans in Florida.\u201d\n\nThe president needs to work on his basic math skills. Republicans flipped at least three seats from the Democrats: North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri. But Democrats flipped two: Arizona and Nevada. So that\u2019s a one-seat gain for the Republicans. Assuming Republican Rick Scott holds on to his narrow lead in Florida, the Republicans would have a gain of two. There is a pending runoff in Mississippi, which is already Republican and expected to remain Republican. So the maximum Trump can expect is two seats, not three. (If the Democrat, Mike Espy, manages an unexpected victory in Mississippi, that would be a flip toward the Democrats and Trump would only be plus one seat.)\n\nGeorge W. Bush gained two Senate seats in 2002, so Trump has tied something that happened 16 years ago, assuming Scott wins. John F. Kennedy earned a gain of three seats in 1962 \u2014 which was 56 years ago, not 80. (Since the Republicans started the 2016-2018 cycle with 52 seats, the net result will be a one seat pick-up, assuming Espy does not win.)\n\n\u201cAlmost picked up Tester. Almost picked up, you know, if you look \u2014 and that was somebody that wasn\u2019t even in play. \u2026 Tester, nobody wanted even to contest it. Well, look at what happened in North Dakota with Heidi. Heidi, they said don\u2019t contest. One year ago when we were looking, they all said don\u2019t contest Heidi, she can\u2019t be beat. She lost by a lot.\u201d\n\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) was always rated the most vulnerable Democrat given Trump\u2019s commanding victory in North Dakota. We cannot imagine any Republican strategist telling Trump that it was not worthwhile to contest her.\n\nTrump made four trips to Montana in four months in an effort to topple incumbent Jon Tester, but Tester had the biggest victory of his career, for the first time topping 50 percent of the vote. More people voted in the midterms than in the 2016 election in 15 counties, with much of the increased turnout in Democratic areas. That indicates that Trump\u2019s efforts helped motivate the opposition.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\n\nShare the Facts 2018-11-16 12:27:48 UTC Washington Post -1 -1 -1 Washington Post Rating: False Washington Post Rating: \u201cI\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019ve had friends talk about it when people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles.

It said the U.S. citizen told investigators that he was under the direction of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nIt said North Korea decided to deport him but did not say why and when.

Warmbier and other previous American detainees in the North were imprisoned there over a variety of alleged crimes, including subversion, anti-state activities and spying.\n\nWarmbier was a rare Western detainee who was released in rough shape __ the vast majority of Americans detained by the North came out in relatively good condition.

Some foreigners have said after their release that their declarations of guilt had been coerced while in North Korean custody.\n\nAfter a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests last year that fueled fears of war, North Korea entered talks with the United States and South Korea early this year with a vague commitment to nuclear disarmament.

After swinging through Japan, Pence went to Singapore for the annual confab of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN).

He declined the opportunity to make the trip, a move some analysts saw as a worrying sign for Washington\u2019s Asian agenda. Russian President Vladimir Putin made a first-ever state visit to Singapore this week in a bid to boost Moscow\u2019s clout in the region. Starting in 2011, Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, made a habit of attending ASEAN meetings; he missed only one, in 2013, when Washington was in the middle of a government shutdown.\n\nTrump \u2014 who, according to one account, has \u201cretreated into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment\u201d over the Mueller investigation and his party\u2019s midterm election losses \u2014 chose to buck the trend.

We support their spread across the wider Indo-Pacific #VPinAsia #ASEAN pic.twitter.com/JQyKqv9fzv \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) November 15, 2018\n\n\u201cEvery country in Southeast Asia is trying to forge a close relationship with the U.S. \u2014 they don\u2019t want to live in a region that\u2019s dominated by China. They want options, and they want balance,\u201d Brian Harding of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said to The Washington Post\u2019s Shibani Mahtani. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t send a good signal [of U.S. commitment] that the president doesn\u2019t want to attend the one summit he\u2019s supposed to in Southeast Asia.\u201d\n\n\u201cOptics are very, very important \u2014 and statements and symbolisms. Who comes, what\u2019s on the table, what\u2019s on the agenda,\u201d Alex Capri, a visiting fellow at the National University of Singapore, said to CNBC. \u201cIf Trump were to come out I think it would have been a much more symbolic that . . . this was more important.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps, given Trump\u2019s recent overseas performances, his no-show isn\u2019t such a bad thing. According to my colleagues, Trump was infuriated by French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s rebuke of his nationalist politics as the two leaders shared a stage in Paris over the weekend. The angry tweets he later aimed at Macron prompted a French government official to accuse the American president of lacking \u201ccommon decency.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a bull carrying his own china shop with him when\u00adever he travels the world,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said to The Post.\n\nBut Pence cuts a more circumspect figure, even while he\u2019s enacting Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nIn Tokyo, he offered standard Washington talking points. \u201cWe seek an Indo-Pacific where every nation \u2026 is free to follow its own path and pursue its own interests, where the seas and skies are open to all engaged in peaceful activity, and where sovereign nations grow stronger together,\" Pence said at a news conference. \u201cAuthoritarianism and aggression have no place in the Indo-Pacific. And I know this vision is shared by the United States and Japan.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Post\u2019s Josh Rogin, Pence talked tough on China and said that Beijing must significantly change its behavior on multiple fronts. The looming trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies probably will dominate headlines ahead of the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires at the end of this month, when Trump and Xi are expected to meet.\n\n\u201cIn addition to trade, Pence said China must offer concessions on several issues, including but not limited to its rampant intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, restricted access to Chinese markets, respect for international rules and norms, efforts to limit freedom of navigation in international waters and Chinese Communist Party interference in the politics of Western countries,\u201d Rogin noted.\n\nIn Port Moresby, Pence is expected to deliver a speech signaling new American efforts to rival China\u2019s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, which has seen Beijing pour billions of dollars into infrastructure projects around the world. It has also led to allegations of graft by local officials and provoked accusations that China is simply a new kind of neocolonial power, locking other developing nations into cycles of debt.\n\nA U.S. official told reporters in Asia that Pence\u2019s plan will be a \u201cprivate-sector-driven mode\u201d rather than the \u201cdangerous debt diplomacy China has been engaging in the region.\u201d\n\nLike an ocean, the Chinese economy has been nurturing and benefiting smaller economies such as Papua New Guinea, said an APEC coordination official https://t.co/s702peVF7m #Xiplomacy pic.twitter.com/HAwh2ReZyn \u2014 China Xinhua News (@XHNews) November 15, 2018\n\nMany countries in Southeast Asia, accustomed to balancing great-power rivalries, will welcome American efforts. But for all of Pence\u2019s bravado, the Trump administration still has plenty of doubters in the region.\n\n\u201cIf Asia matters to America, why is your leader President Trump not here?\u201d Tommy Koh, a senior Singaporean diplomat, asked in the South China Morning Post. He added that Washington\u2019s overzealous confrontation with Beijing would damage its broader engagement with Asia given that China is the biggest trade partner of virtually every country in the region. \u201cIs the strategic intent of this concept targeted at excluding China from the family?\u201d Koh asked. \"If so we are not comfortable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also unlikely China will make many \u2014 or any \u2014 of the concessions Pence demanded. An offer Beijing put forward on Thursday to kick-start moribund trade talks looks unlikely to break the current impasse, according to reports.\n\nBut things could yet break in the administration\u2019s favor. \u201cGiven Mr Trump\u2019s obvious disdain for allies, it is unclear how many would opt for America over China if forced by Washington to make a choice right now,\u201d wrote Jamil Anderlini of the Financial Times. \u201cBut if he . . . starts working closely with other countries to isolate China, then Mr Xi will be in a lot more trouble.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

Palaniswami, told reporters the storm had killed 13 people in the state.\n\nInitial reports indicate the deaths were caused by wall collapses and electrocution, said National Disaster Response Force official Umesh, who uses one name.\n\nThe storm felled trees and power lines, and authorities preventively disconnected the electricity supply to the worst-hit areas to prevent electrocutions. Schools were closed in places, and vehicles remained off the roads in most parts of Nagapattinam and Karaikal districts, the Press Trust of India news agency said.\n\nHeavy rains damaged rice fields and roads, and strong winds uprooted banana and papaya trees along the coastline.\n\nNagapattinam district bore the brunt of the cyclone with a rainfall of 15 centimetres (6 inches), the local weather office said.\n\nThe storm heavily damaged a 16th century Roman Catholic Shrine Basilica at Velankanni, a small town in Nagapattinam district, Press Trust of India said.\n\nThe cyclone destroyed or partially damaged nearly 1,600 mud huts and uprooted more than 5,000 trees in the area, state authorities said.\n\nState-owned Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation said more than 13,000 electricity poles, 13 distribution transformers and 1,000 cables were damaged by strong winds and rains.\n\nTamil Nadu state is prone to cyclones that develop in the Bay of Bengal. In 1999, a cyclone killed more than 15,000 people in eastern Orissa.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

During the show and in backstage interviews, artists alluded to such topics as immigration and violence affecting several countries.\n\n\u201cIn these times of crisis, art becomes a medium that reminds us of the urgency of justice and the need to find solutions that invite unity ... tolerance and inclusion,\u201d host Ana de la Reguera said before norte\u00f1o group Calibre 50 performed \u201cCorrido de Juanito,\u201d which tells the story of a man who immigrated to the U.S.\n\nMexican rock band Mana, honored Wednesday as the Latin Recording Academy\u2019s Person of the Year, also took the stage performing a medley that included its hits \u201cLabios Compartidos\u201d and \u201cClavado en un Bar.\u201d\n\nThe academy bestowed the honor on the band for its achievements and contributions to the Latin community and support of environmental protection and human rights causes.\n\n\u201cWe will continue fighting for the rights of the immigrants who have made this country great in the last century,\u201d lead singer Fher Olvera said, referring to the United States. \u201cThey were the difference for this country to be as big as it is. We will fight for Mother Earth, we will fight for women\u2019s rights and we will continue fighting to make songs from the heart and soul.\u201d\n\nThe band took the opportunity to announce that after two years without playing live, they will start a world tour next year.\n\nMarc Anthony, Will Smith and Bad Bunny kicked off the night with a performance of their racy single \u201cEsta Rico.\u201d\n\nLaura Pausini won for best traditional pop vocal album with \u201cHazte Sentir,\u201d while the trophy for best salsa album was given to Victor Manuelle with \u201c25/7.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaddy, this is for you,\u201d Manuelle said looking up after mentioning his father\u2019s death earlier this year.\n\nThe coveted Latin Grammy for best new artist went to Karol G. She defeated nine other artists, including Angela Aguilar, Anaadi, El David Aguilar and Alex Ferreira.\n\nMost of the night\u2019s awards were presented during a pre-telecast ceremony. Among those who walked away with trophies were Lafourcade for best folk album with \u201cMusas (un homenaje al folclore latinoamericano en manos de Los Macorinos), Vol. 2,\u201d Aterciopelados for best alternative album with \u201cClaroscura\u201d \u2014 their first album in a decade \u2014 and Linda Brice\u00f1o, who became the first woman to be honored as producer of the year.\n\n\u201cI am very grateful,\u201d Lafourcade said after receiving her trophy. \u201cI want to dedicate this to Mexico, to Latin America, to all our brothers who are arriving to Mexico, who come from many places, that are going through difficult times. Our hearts with you.\u201d\n\nAbsent from the ceremony, the extremely private Luis Miguel won the award for album of the year with \u201c\u00a1M\u00e9xico por siempre!\u201d defeating an eclectic group of established and rising artists that included Balvin, Pablo Alboran (\u201dPrometo\u201d), Drexler (\u201dSalvavidas de hielo\u201d), Kany Garc\u00eda (\u201dSoy yo\u201d), Lafourcade (\u201dMusas, un homenaje al folclore latinoamericano en nanos de Los Macorinos, Vol. 2\u201d), and Rozalen (\u201dCuando el rio suena...\u201d), among others.\n\nAfter Thalia revealed Luis Miguel as the winner, the crowd at the MGM Grand Garden Arena had mixed reactions, with some booing and whistling because the star did not picked up his trophy.\n\n\u201cHe is not here is with us but ... hey, hey, calm down! I\u2019m going to personally deliver it to him,\u201d she said with a wink, which served to appease the audience and generate an ovation.\n\nThe 19th Latin Grammys Awards ceremony was telecast live from the MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n\n___\n\nRatner-Arias reported from New York.\n\n___\n\nFollow Regina Garcia Cano on Twitter at https://twitter.com/reginagarciakNO and Sigal Ratner-Arias at https://twitter.com/sigalratner .\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://www.latingrammy.com/en\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Officials reached Friday by phone at the local religious affairs bureau, its department regulating the Catholic church and police headquarters said they had no knowledge of Shao\u2019s situation and refused to give their names.\n\nAsked about the matter, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying offered no information on Shao\u2019s disappearance but reiterated Beijing\u2019s hopes for better ties with the Holy See.\n\n\u201cWe would like to improve our mutual understanding and enhance our mutual trust so as to advance our relations with the Vatican,\u201d Hua said at a daily briefing.\n\nShao\u2019s disappearance follows a breakthrough agreement to give China some say over the appointment of bishops that critics called a cave-in to the ruling Communist Party just as it is waging a sweeping crackdown on religion.

(Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 With about 3,000 Central American migrants having reached the Mexican border across from California and thousands more anticipated, the mayor of Tijuana said Friday that the city was preparing for an influx that will last at least six months and may have no end in sight.\n\nJuan Manuel Gastelum said there were 2,750 migrants from the caravan in Tijuana and that estimates by Mexico\u2019s federal government indicate the number could approach 10,000.\n\n\u201cNo city in the world is prepared to receive this \u2014 if I\u2019m allowed \u2014 this avalanche,\u201d he said during a news conference at City Hall. \u201cIt is a tsunami. There is concern among all citizens of Tijuana.\u201d\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana\u2019s main crossing to San Diego, creating long waits. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nAlong the nearly 3,000 miles (nearly 5,000 kilometers) from the caravan\u2019s origin in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, to this city on the Pacific Ocean, the migrants have stopped in most places for only a single night, with some exceptions.\n\nThat overwhelmed small towns in southern Mexico in particular \u2014 but only briefly. The migrants\u2019 expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the teeming border city of more than 1.6 million to handle the influx.\n\nPleading for financial support from the Mexican government, Gastelum sternly warned migrants against criminal behavior, though authorities reported only seven arrests so far \u2014 five for drug consumption and two for disorderly conduct.\n\n\u201cSupposedly they are fleeing catastrophe, mistreatment in their countries of origin. How is it possible that they arrive here and, if they want, create disorder?\u201d the mayor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nHis language linking the latest arrivals to crime underscores how the caravan is already testing Tijuana\u2019s proud history as a melting pot for immigrants, a tradition that Gastelum also highlighted.\n\nA municipal gymnasium and recreational complex that has been converted to a shelter was expected to register up to 1,000 people Thursday night but ended up housing more than 2,000, including more than 400 children. Authorities promised more toilets.\n\nTijuana officials said they opened the shelter as part of an effort to keep migrants out of public spaces.\n\nThe city\u2019s privately run shelters are meant to have a capacity of 700.\n\nGastelum wondered why the migrants chose Tijuana instead of other Mexican cities on the U.S. border, vaguely suggesting a sinister plot without elaborating.\n\n\u201cThere is an intention to do things badly. There is an intention to prejudice Tijuana, and we cannot allow that,\u201d he said.\n\nHis comments marked a contrast to a more welcoming tone from other officials. Francisco Rueda, the top deputy to Baja California Gov. Francisco Vega de la Madrid, said Thursday that the state had 7,000 jobs available for any migrants who obtain legal status in Mexico.\n\nAlso Friday, another caravan set out from Mexico City heading toward the border.\n\nIn Tijuana, concerns are rising about what the Central Americans will do while they wait months to apply for asylum in the United States, or how they will support themselves in the meantime.\n\nAt the sports complex turned shelter, migrants napped on mattresses, played soccer and exchanged banter on a crowded, adjoining courtyard.

Her congressional term will end next year but she has registered to run to replace her daughter as governor of northern Ilocos Norte province.\n\nThe cases against her were filed in 1991 and took nearly three decades of trial by several judges and prosecutors.

Officials have alleged that the emails were hacked by Russian spies and transferred to WikiLeaks.\n\n[In email to Trump\u2019s campaign strategist, Roger Stone implied he knew of WikiLeaks\u2019s plans]\n\nMueller also has been exploring, among other things, communications between the group and associates of President Trump, including political operative Roger Stone and commentator and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi.\n\nIn July, Mueller\u2019s office charged 12 Russian military spies with conspiring to hack DNC computers, stealing the organization\u2019s data and publishing the files in an effort to disrupt the election, and referred in an indictment to WikiLeaks, described only as \u201cOrganization 1,\u201d as the platform the Russians used to release the stolen emails.\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\n\n\nWikileaks founder Julian Assange walks onto the balcony of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. (Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP)\n\nIt was not immediately clear what charges Assange would face. In the past, prosecutors had contemplated pursuing a case involving conspiracy, theft of government property or violating the Espionage Act. But whether to charge the WikiLeaks founder was hardly a foregone conclusion. In the Obama administration, the Justice Department had concluded that pursuing Assange would be akin to prosecuting a news organization. In the Trump administration, though, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had taken a more aggressive stance and vowed to crack down on all government leaks.\n\nBarry J. Pollack, one of Assange\u2019s attorneys, said, \u201cThe only thing more irresponsible than charging a person for publishing truthful information would be to put in a public filing information that clearly was not intended for the public and without any notice to Mr. Assange. Obviously, I have no idea if he has actually been charged or for what, but the notion that the federal criminal charges could be brought based on the publication of truthful information is an incredibly dangerous precedent to set.\u201d\n\nThe filing in the Eastern District of Virginia came Aug. 22 in a case that combines national security and sex trafficking. Seitu Sulayman Kokayi, 29, was charged with enticing a 15-year-old girl to have sex with him and send him pornographic images of herself. But he was detained in part because he \u201chas a substantial interest in terrorist acts,\u201d according to the court filing.\n\nHis father-in-law, according to the filing, has been convicted of terrorist acts. The case involves previously classified information, according to government filings, and prosecutors plan to use information obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Kokayi was indicted last week and is set to be arraigned Friday morning.\n\n[Analysis: A timeline of the Roger Stone-WikiLeaks question]\n\nThe case had been sealed until early September, though by itself it attracted little notice. On Thursday evening, Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, who is known for scrubbing court filings, joked about the apparent error on Twitter \u2014 which first brought it to the attention of reporters.\n\nEven if he is charged, Assange\u2019s coming to the United States to face trial is no sure thing. Since June 2012, Assange has been living in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London, afraid that if he steps outside he will be arrested.\n\nWhen he first sought asylum in the embassy, he was facing possible extradition to Sweden in a sex crimes case. He has argued that case was a pretext for what he predicted would be his arrest and extradition to the United States.\n\nIn the years since, the Swedish case has been closed, but Assange has said he cannot risk leaving the embassy because the United States would attempt to have him arrested and extradited for disclosures of U.S. government secrets. Throughout that time, the United States has refused to say whether there are any sealed charges against Assange.\n\nIf Assange were to leave the embassy and be arrested by British authorities, he would likely still fight extradition in the British courts.\n\nRachel Weiner and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "UN committee criticizes human rights violations in Iran", "description": "A U.N. committee has approved a resolution urging Iran to stop its widespread use of arbitrary detention and expressing serious concern over its \"alarmingly high\" use of the death penalty", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/un-committee-criticizes-human-rights-violations-in-iran/2018/11/15/44e3bf72-e954-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T04:01:18Z", "content": "UNITED NATIONS A U.N. committee on human rights approved a resolution Thursday urging Iran to stop its widespread use of arbitrary detention and expressing serious concern at its alarmingly high use of the death penalty.

The U.S.-based nonprofit group called for South Korea to take stronger steps to fight a tuberculosis crisis in North Korea it says has worsened under strengthened U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile program. (Lee Jin-man/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The withdrawal of a major international aid organization threatens to leave tens of thousands of tuberculosis patients in North Korea without the medication they need and could spiral into a severe crisis if it is not addressed soon, according to health experts familiar with the situation in the North.\n\nThe dwindling stockpile of crucial medications follows the abrupt departure of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, an international aid organization whose grants to North Korea supported the treatment of 120,000 TB patients last year. Its support officially ended in June despite an outcry among health officials in North Korea and in the international community that it could spark a major epidemic.\n\nNeurosurgeon Kee Park, of the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change at Harvard Medical School, said in an email to The Associated Press that the situation is extremely dire and likely to get dramatically worse in the years ahead if it is not properly dealt with.\n\nThe U.S.-based nonprofit Eugene Bell Foundation, which works on the ground treating tuberculosis in North Korea, said Friday that the crisis is being compounded by U.S.-led sanctions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile program.\n\nNorth Korea has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of tuberculosis, a highly infectious disease that, while treatable, globally causes more than 1 million deaths each year. According to the World Health Organization, about 107,000 cases of tuberculosis were reported in North Korea in 2017. Making matters worse, North Korea has estimated that 6-7 percent of its tuberculosis population has the drug-resistant variety, known as MDR-TB, which is far more difficult and costly to cure.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the loss of the Global Fund grants for the DPRK, we expect a 50-75 percent reduction in treatment capacity for non-MDR-TB patients,\u201d Park said. \u201cConsequently, our model predicts between 155,000 to 210,000 more people will die from TB-related causes within five years. To be clear, these are new deaths that are expected on top of the current mortality rates. We have assumed that the treatment of MDR-TB will continue at current levels.\u201d\n\nDrug-resistant tuberculosis generally results from patients not taking the proper amount or combination of medications to completely cure them of the disease, or by coming into contact with someone who has been infected with it already.\n\nIt is often found among populations that have had some exposure to TB medications, such as cities or other places with populations that are relatively more affluent \u2014 or at least affluent enough to have paid for some form of TB medication already.\n\nPyongyang, the North Korean capital, is believed to have a particularly high incidence of the drug-resistant TB strain.\n\nGlobal Fund announced in February that it was ending its grants to North Korea, effectively ending the largest outside public health assistance program ever for the North, because of a lack of transparency and difficult operating conditions. It has said its stockpile would last for a year, which is longer than the average 6- to 9-month course of treatment for a TB patient.\n\nBut the concern is over what will happen after that, how any new cases can be treated if no one else steps in to fill the gap and whether the limited pool of medications would be \u201crationed\u201d in an ill-advised effort to spread out what medications are left.\n\n\u201cTime is ticking,\u201d Park said. \u201cI have heard from people who have been inside recently that the rationing has already started.\u201d\n\nThe problem is especially acute because North Korea has a fragile public health system that could easily be overwhelmed by a large outbreak, sending North Koreans streaming across the country\u2019s border with China, making the epidemic a bigger, regional issue.\n\nConcerns over such a calamity prompted the North to essentially close its borders during the Ebola scare in 2015 and during the SARS outbreak in 2003 in China, though neither seemed to present much of a threat to the isolated North.\n\nStephen Linton, chairman of the Eugene Bell Foundation, told reporters in Seoul that South Korea lacks the sense of urgency to help groups like his gain sanctions exemptions so that they can deliver supplies to treat patients in North Korea.\n\nHe likened the problem to having the house next door on fire, and said North Korea\u2019s tuberculosis problem could potentially have health consequences for South Korea.\n\nLinton said he believes Global Fund\u2019s decision was at least partially connected to sanctions-related pressure. The U.S. government, which pledged $1.4 billion this year, is one of the biggest donors to Global Fund.\n\nHe noted that it has also gotten harder for American aid workers to get permission to travel to the North since President Donald Trump announced his travel ban for U.S. citizens more than a year ago.\n\nChoi Seemoon, a Eugene Bell director, said that while Eugene Bell and Global Fund have provided MDR-TB medications to about 2,000 patients this year, that\u2019s less than 30 percent of the estimated 8,000 North Koreans with the condition. Global Fund\u2019s stock of regular tuberculosis medicine will run out in early 2020, she warned, while its stock of MDR-TB medicine can only cover patients registered by the autumn of this year.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a quick purchase of medicine and supplies to overcome the void left by Global Fund,\u201d Choi said. \u201cWhether the issue is resolved through inter-Korean talks or through international bodies and non-governmental channels, there should be a quick delivery of tuberculosis medicine to North Korea regardless of what channel it takes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTalmadge is the AP\u2019s Pyongyang bureau chief.

(Yong Teck Lim/Associated Press)\n\nSYDNEY \u2014 A top Australian official seized Friday on past comments from Malaysia\u2019s prime minister seen as anti-Semitic, amid a diplomatic war of words over the possibility of Canberra moving its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad raised the potential embassy switch in a meeting with Australian counterpart Scott Morrison in Singapore on Thursday, later telling reporters such a move could increase the threat of terrorism.\n\n\u201cI pointed out that in dealing with terrorism, one has to know the causes,\u201d Mahathir said. \u201cAdding to the cause for terrorism is not going to be helpful.\u201d\n\nAustralian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg responded Friday, saying Canberra would make its own decisions. Frydenberg, the son of a Holocaust survivor, also pointed out past comments that the leader of Muslim-majority Malaysia has made about Jewish people.\n\n\u201cHe has called Jews \u2018hooked-nosed people.\u2019 He has questioned the number of people that have been killed in the Holocaust. He banned \u2018Schindler\u2019s List\u2019 as a movie being shown,\u201d Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC last month, Mahathir said \u201cthe problem in the Middle East began with the creation of Israel,\u201d and he defended his description of Jews as \u201chook-nosed\u201d in his book, \u201cThe Malay Dilemma.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are hook-nosed. Many people called the Malays fat-nosed. We didn\u2019t object,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nMahathir also challenged historical accounts that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, saying the figure was 4 million.\n\nIn 1994, \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d became one of many films banned in Malaysia during Mahathir\u2019s previous time as prime minister, with the country\u2019s film board rejecting it as Zionist propaganda.\n\nWhen asked by The Associated Press in an August interview about his past comments about Jewish people, Mahathir said \u201cwe should be able to criticize everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnti-Semitic is a term that is invented to prevent people from criticizing the Jews for doing wrong things,\u201d he said.\n\nAustralia\u2019s indication that it may follow the United States\u2019 contentious move of relocating its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv was seen by many Australians as a political stunt. Critics called it a cynical attempt to win votes in a by-election last month for a Sydney seat with a high Jewish population.\n\nBut on Friday, Frydenberg insisted shifting the embassy made sense, although it has also inflamed tensions with Australia\u2019s closest neighbor, Muslim-majority Indonesia.\n\n\u201cAustralia already recognizes Israel\u2019s sovereignty over West Jerusalem. It\u2019s where the Israeli Parliament is. It\u2019s where the Australian ambassador presents his or her credentials. It will be the capital of Israel under any two-state solution,\u201d Frydenberg said.\n\nMorrison said Friday that a decision on the embassy would be made by Christmas, but rejected fears the plan had caused collateral damage by placing in jeopardy a proposed free trade agreement with Indonesia.\n\n\u201cI do not conflate the issues,\u201d Morrison told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to understand is that Australia has to set its own foreign policy and all I have said is that we would consider this question if we believed that it would advance the issues of the two-state solution.\u201d\n\nIndonesian opposition politician Dian Islamiati Fatwa also warned this week that Australia moving its embassy may provoke Islamic radicals in his country.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Is it a tooth? The fingernail size piece of stucco. Is it a bone?\n\n\u201cWe have never had anything of this magnitude,\u201d said Bailey, 58, whose team had found the remains of two victims the previous day. \u201cI have seen burned bodies before, but never just disintegrated. It\u2019s usually not like this.\u201d\n\nA week after the Camp Fire was sparked in Northern California, the death toll from the state\u2019s deadliest wildfire in its history continues to grow. At least 63 people have died in the fire, officials said, including the remains of seven people discovered Thursday. But search teams continue to sift through an estimated 10,000 destroyed structures for signs of the people who remain unaccounted for, an ever-changing list of names amid the frenzy of new and canceled missing-persons reports. The number of missing people increased dramatically, to 631.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand, this is a dynamic list,\u201d Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea said. \u201cSome days might be less people, some days might be more people, but my hope at the end of the day, we have accounted for everybody.\u201d\n\nSome remains may never be recovered, the sheriff said.\n\nWith this hilltop community still smoldering, California authorities are leaning on volunteers such as Bailey for what is being called the largest body-recovery mission in state history, and one of the largest in the United States since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nAfter Honea put on a statewide appeal for help earlier this week, more than 450 members of California search-and-rescue teams have come here offering to help. They represent nearly all of California\u2019s 58 counties, highlighting the effectiveness of a state law that mandates each county sheriff maintain volunteer search-and-rescue teams.\n\nThe volunteers are a variety of ages, both male and female, \u201ca cross-section of our community,\u201d as Ben Ho, who coordinates \u00adcadaver-dog teams for the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, put it.\n\n\n\nVolunteer Harry Halterman crawls out of a shed while searching for human remains in Paradise, Calif. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nBailey joined the effort eight years ago, as a volunteer in an aquatic search-and-rescue unit in Southern California. Her unit, based in Kern County, usually responds to water rescues in the Kern River or missing hikers in the lower Sierra Nevada mountains, but has been called in to other areas with large-scale disasters.\n\nEven here in California, where the concept of search and rescue dates back to efforts to rescue settlers who went missing while crossing the Sierra Nevada mountains in the 1800s, the scale of the Camp Fire response is testing first responders. As the number of state fire disasters continues to grow, state emergency officials say communities here and nationwide need to step up drills and training for how to effectively use volunteer search-and-rescue teams in natural disasters and other mass-causality events.\n\nMany cadaver dogs are not as prepared as they should be to work safely in ash, officials said. California emergency managers also continue to refine how volunteer search and rescue should be deployed, and under what command.\n\n\u201cEach one seems to be much more intense, and also the expectation of the public, the families, the agencies, is that we can do a number of tasks that are very challenging,\u201d Ho said. \u201cThis is daunting \u2014 both physically and mentally.\u201d\n\nHo said the modern-day search-and-rescue team can be traced back to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which devastated parts of San Francisco Bay area. At the time, Ho was a search manager for the Oakland, Calif., fire department. After both San Francisco Bay area communities and federal officials struggled to respond to the earthquake, President George H.W. Bush pressed Ho and other regional emergency managers to develop a more effective plan for search and rescue, including more cadaver dog teams.\n\n\u201cHe said we need to have the SWAT teams of rescue teams throughout the country and go to big disasters,\u201d Ho said.\n\nAfter a few years of planning, including the formation of committees Ho participated in, \u00admodern-day urban search-and-rescue teams were formed. States and localities also greatly expanded use of cadaver dog units.\n\nThose teams, which often operate in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have been front-line responders to disasters, such as 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nThere has also been a proliferation of volunteer wilderness search-and-rescue teams, especially here in California. Christopher Boyer, executive director of the National Association for Search and Rescue, said wilderness teams are better suited to respond to the Camp Fire due to the scope of the disaster, which has charred about 140,000 acres \u2014 nearly the size of Chicago.\n\n\u201cThe FEMA teams are designed around finding live people, and their dogs find live people,\u201d said Boyer, whose organization has about 16,000 members. In Paradise, \u201cwe are talking about finding human remains, and in some cases, cremains that have been burnt.\u201d\n\nMany of the responders to the Paradise fire say they were stunned by the devastation they now must work in.\n\nDavid Freeman, a search volunteer from El Dorado County near Sacramento, compared his task to working on the moon.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even seem real,\u201d said Freeman, 75. \u201cWe are basically looking for anything that looks like it could be a body, but the fire was so hot, there may not be a lot left there.\u201d\n\nEach morning, the volunteers are broken up into teams of eight to 10 people. If they find suspected human remains, the volunteers have access to anthropologists who help differentiate human remains from animals. Coroner teams are then responsible for removing the bodies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bailey\u2019s team discovered half of a human skull and several bone fragments, roughly the size of a knuckle, she said.\n\nBut Honea, who is also the Butte County coroner, has been warning this grief-stricken community that some victims may not be found. The fire was so hot, he said, \u201cit\u2019s possible that some remains were completely consumed by fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue our search, but at some point, ultimately, with the passage of time and circumstantial evidence will lead us to the conclusion they\u2019ve perished,\u201d Honea said.\n\nThe scale of the disaster is even posing problems for cadaver dogs. Although the dogs are trained to sniff out human remains, even those that have been badly burned, public safety officials say the dogs are encountering challenges working in rough terrain that many here fear could be toxic.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t put booties on their paws because that is like a rock climber with gloves on,\u201d Ho said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put masks on them, because they need their noses.\u201d\n\nMike Delannoy, a volunteer dog handler from Riverside County, spent Thursday morning running his six-year-old border collie, Journey, through a destroyed house. A woman who lives there had been reported missing, but Journey gave only fleeting signals that any remains were located the property, and ultimately none were found.\n\n\u201cThe takeaway for us will be we need to focus more on training for large areas with cadaver dog teams,\u201d Delannoy said. \u201cThis is an environment where I want to minimize the time he is active in an area.\u201d\n\nBut Yerania Molina, a search-and-rescue volunteer from Kern County, said she\u2019s not sure any amount of training could have prepared first responders for what they are encountering in Paradise.\n\nMolina, 37, has a full-time job as an information technology specialist. Since joining Kern County\u2019s rescue team three years ago, Molina has helped recover nine bodies, mostly from the Kern River.\n\nOn Thursday, as she prepared for her daily assignment, Molina said she and her fellow teammates approach their jobs with a mix of adrenaline and anxiety.\n\n\u201cYou hope you don\u2019t find anybody today because you don\u2019t want any more deaths,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut you also know you that you have to find them because you know they are out there.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Cambodian tribunal session set for verdicts on Khmer Rouge", "description": "Tribunal judging former Khmer Rouge leaders for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians has opened its session to deliver its verdicts on charges of genocide and other crimes", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/cambodian-tribunal-session-set-for-verdicts-on-khmer-rouge/2018/11/15/8de489ee-e94b-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T02:58:56Z", "content": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia The international tribunal to judge the criminal responsibility of former Khmer Rouge leaders for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians has opened its session to deliver its verdicts on charges of genocide and other crimes.

(Mark Peters/Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 The last surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge regime that ruled Cambodia in the 1970s, when their reign of terror was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million people, were convicted Friday by an international tribunal of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nNuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were top leaders in a regime that forced residents out of the cities into the countryside, where they labored under brutal conditions in giant agricultural cooperatives and work projects. The communist Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of the late Pol Pot, sought to eliminate all traces of what they saw as corrupt bourgeois life, destroying most religious, financial and social institutions.\n\nNuon Chea (NOO\u2019-ahn CHEE\u2019-ah) and Khieu Samphan (KEE\u2019-yoh sahm-PAHN\u2019) were sentenced by the U.N.-assisted court to life in prison, the same punishment they are already serving after being convicted in a previous trial for crimes against humanity connected with forced transfers of people and mass disappearances. Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was considered the Khmer Rouge\u2019s main ideologist and Pol Pot\u2019s right-hand man, while Khieu Samphan, 87, served as the head of state, presenting a moderate veneer as the public face for the highly secretive group.\n\nDissent under Khmer Rouge rule was usually met with death, and even the group\u2019s loyalists faced torture and execution as the radical experiment at revolution failed, with blame cast about its ranks for alleged sabotage.\n\nBut executions counted for only a fraction of the death toll. Starvation, overwork and medical neglect took many more lives, amounting to as much as one-quarter to one-third of the entire population.\n\nOnly when an invasion by Vietnam finally drove the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979 did the magnitude of Cambodia\u2019s holocaust become known.\n\nFriday\u2019s verdict, read aloud by Judge Nil Nonn, established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities.\n\nScholars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic minority whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. They included murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nThe tribunal, officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC, also ordered reparations for some of those judged to be victims.\n\nIt found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham for insufficient evidence, though he was convicted of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nAmong the large crowd of spectators at Friday\u2019s session was 65-year-old Sum Rithy, who said he had been jailed for nearly two years under the Khmer Rouge, who accused him of being a spy for the CIA. His life was spared only because he was a skilled mechanic who could maintain engines and generators for his captors.\n\nRithy said three of his siblings were killed, also accused of being CIA spies, while his father died of starvation.\n\n\u201cToday, I am very happy that both the Khmer Rouge leaders were sentenced to life in prison. The verdict was fair enough for me and other Cambodian victims,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night, I could not sleep because I was afraid that Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan could die before this verdict was announced.\u201d\n\nNuon Chea suffers heart problems and was allowed to move from the hearing room to a separate holding room. Khieu Samphan was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nLawyers for Nuon Chea said they would appeal, and Khieu Samphan was expected to do the same.\n\nBoth men have suggested they were targets of political persecution.\n\nThe tribunal in 2010 also convicted Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia\u2019s long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further cases to go forward, saying they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted by Vietnam\u2019s invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid court in which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to attain a broader sweep of justice has troubled some observers.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s verdict hopefully brings some measure of justice to the victims, 40 years after the unspeakable mass atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia,\u201d said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International\u2019s regional director for East and Southeast Asia. \u201cWhile this second trial of the Khmer Rouge\u2019s last surviving senior leaders results in two convictions, and 14 reparation projects, this is bitter justice: the world has waited far too long for this moment. Decades after the crimes and 13 years after it was established, the ECCC should have achieved much more.\u201d\n\nOthers, however, highlighted the tribunal\u2019s accomplishments.\n\n\u201cInternational tribunals are better than the alternative, impunity. They will always be political and fall short of expectations,\u201d Alexander Hinton, an anthropology professor at Rutgers University and author of two books about the tribunal, said ahead of Friday\u2019s verdicts. \u201cBut justice is usually delivered, even if at times, as has been the case with the ECCC, it staggers across the finish line.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The U.S. stock market opens at 9:30 a.m. EDT on Friday, Nov. 16. (Richard Drew, File/Associated Press)\n\nWall Street capped a day of volatile trading with a late-afternoon buying spree that sent U.S. stock indexes to a mostly higher finish Friday.\n\nDespite the 11th-hour rally, the benchmark S&P 500 index ended with its second weekly loss in four weeks.\n\nGains in health care and energy companies powered the market higher.\n\nThe market got a brief boost after President Donald Trump expressed optimism that the U.S. and China will reach a deal to resolve their costly trade dispute. The remarks came as representatives of both countries have resumed talks.\n\nLarge retailers and media and communications companies were the laggards.\n\n\u201cThe market and market participants are more unsettled now than they have been in years,\u201d said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager with Globalt Investments. \u201cWe\u2019re that much further on in the cycle and you have these tariffs and trade wars that are really still in the very early stages.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose 6.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,736.27. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 123.95 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,413.22. The Nasdaq composite slid 11.16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,247.87. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies picked up 3.41 points, or 0.2 percent, to $1,527.53.\n\nThe S&P 500, which finished higher for the second straight day, ended the week with a loss of 1.6 percent.\n\nLike much of this week, the market spent much of Friday veering between bouts of listless trading and modest swings.\n\n\u201cInvestors are really trying to figure out how they want to be positioned based on the incoming information,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to me that at this time of year, given what we\u2019ve seen, that we\u2019re getting the intraday moves we\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\nOne of the day\u2019s market swings came as traders reacted to Trump\u2019s remarks on trade.\n\nAt the White House, speaking about the lingering trade dispute, the president said he hoped the U.S. could make a deal with China.\n\n\u201cI think a deal will be made,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out very soon.\u201d\n\nStocks snapped higher after the remarks were reported, with the Dow briefly jumping as much as 220 points, before pulling back to about where they were beforehand.\n\nSoybean futures spiked after Trump\u2019s comments. Soybean prices have fallen sharply since this Spring as the trade dispute with China led to a steep drop in China\u2019s purchases of U.S. soybeans. Soybean futures jumped from $8.83 to $8.92 a bushel following the comments. They had traded as high as $10.78 a bushel in early March.\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods over complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of market access. That tariff is set to rise to 25 percent in January. Another $50 billion of Chinese goods already is subject to 25 percent duties. Beijing has responded with penalty duties on $110 billion of American goods.\n\nWashington and Beijing resumed talks over their spiraling trade dispute this week ahead of a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Trump, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said Thursday.\n\nHealth care stocks were among the biggest gainers Friday. Universal Health Services gained 3.9 percent to $133.\n\nTroubled California power provider PG&E surged 37.5 percent to $24.40 after the president of the utility\u2019s state regulator said it was essential for a power company to have the financial strength to operate safely. The remark late Thursday by California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker appeared to reassure investors concerned the company may face a torrent of costs related to the devastating wildfire in Northern California. There\u2019s been speculation that PG&E\u2019s equipment may have set off the blaze, which started Nov. 8 and has killed at least 56 people.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia led a sell-off in technology stocks. The company plunged 18.8 percent to $164.43 after saying it had a large number of unsold chips because of a big drop in mining of cryptocurrencies.\n\nRetailers also weighed on the market. Nordstrom cratered 13.7 percent to $50.93 after the department store issued weak guidance for the full year. That disappointing outlook overshadowed the company\u2019s third-quarter results, which topped Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma tumbled 11.2 percent to $53.76 after the cookware seller said products were delayed because of shipping congestion out of China ahead of U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe price of U.S. crude oil finished flat after a two-day winning streak. Benchmark U.S. crude oil was unchanged at $56.46 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 0.2 percent to $66.76 a barrel in London. Despite the latest uptick, U.S. crude oil is still down about 13 percent for the month.\n\nThe pickup in oil prices helped lift energy stocks. Helmerich & Payne rose 4.2 percent to $62.59.\n\nIn other energy trading, heating oil held steady to $2.07 a gallon and wholesale gasoline jumped 1.3 percent to $1.58 a gallon.\n\nNatural gas, which spiked earlier this week amid forecasts calling for a cold snap across much of the Northeast and South, continued to climb Friday, adding 5.8 percent to $4.27 per 1,000 cubic feet. It is now up around 32 percent this month.\n\nBond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury fell to 3.07 percent from 3.11 percent late Thursday.\n\nThe dollar fell to 112.83 yen from 113.58 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.1412 from $1.1348. The pound rose to $1.2831 from $1.2791.\n\nThe price of gold rose 0.7 percent to $1,223 an ounce. Silver gained 0.8 percent to $14.38 an ounce. Copper climbed 1.9 percent to $2.80 a pound.\n\nMajor European stock indexes closed lower as trade tensions and political risks surrounding Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union kept investors cautious. Germany\u2019s DAX lost 0.1 percent and France\u2019s CAC slid 0.2 percent. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 gave up 0.3 percent.\n\nIn Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index lost 0.6 percent while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.3 percent. South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 0.2 percent.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Stacy Revere/Getty Images)\n\nApparently 108 wins, a World Series victory and a Gold Glove were not enough for Mookie Betts. The Boston Red Sox outfielder added the American League MVP award to his rapidly expanding list of accomplishments, the Baseball Writers' Association of America announced Thursday night. Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich took the honor in the National League.\n\nBetts claimed the MVP award after an all-around, wire-to-wire performance that helped the Red Sox win the most games in the majors before they captured their fourth championship in 15 years. Yelich was similarly electric from start to finish, but he was particularly productive as the Brewers made their unlikely late-season push to win the NL Central. Betts beat out Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout and Cleveland Indians third baseman Jose Ramirez; Yelich bested Chicago Cubs second baseman Javier Baez and Colorado Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado.\n\nTwenty-eight of 30 first-place votes went to Betts on the AL ballot; Trout received one and finished well behind Betts in second place. (Boston slugger J.D. Martinez, who finished fourth, got the other first-place vote.) Yelich received 29 first-place votes, with the other going to New York Mets ace Jacob deGrom, who won the Cy Young Award on Wednesday. Washington Nationals starter Max Scherzer, who finished second in Cy Young voting, was 10th on the MVP list after receiving two third-place votes. Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon finished 11th.\n\n\u201cThere were just a lot of things that went right,\u201d Betts said on a conference call with reporters Thursday night.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome to share it with close friends and family, and people who had a huge impact for most of my life,\u201d said Yelich, who watched the announcement from his home in Southern California, wearing a Los Angeles Fire Department hat. \u201cI told them this moment is as much about them as it is about myself, and we can all share it together.\u201d\n\nBetts was named MVP as the centerpiece of the World Series champions, considered one of the more dynamic teams in baseball history after the Red Sox tore through the New York Yankees, Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers in the postseason. Betts led the majors with a .346 batting average \u2014 16 points ahead of Martinez. He also scored 129 runs, drove in 80, smacked 32 home runs batting leadoff and stole 30 bases. Betts was also dynamic in right field, collecting his second Gold Glove award last week, and he led all players with 10.4 wins above replacement, according to FanGraphs.\n\nBetts\u2019s win was not the only accomplishment on the AL side. Trout finished in the top two of AL voting for the sixth time in his seven full major league seasons, an unprecedented run that included a rookie of the year award at 20, MVP awards in 2014 and 2016, and now four runner-up finishes. In 2017, the only season he was outside of the top two, the 27-year-old finished fourth. Trout led the AL with 122 walks and a .460 on-base percentage, hit .312 and finished with 39 home runs, But that amounted to just 79 RBI, largely because of the inept Angels offense surrounding him. He likely would have needed higher run production (though he did score 101 himself) to edge Betts for the award. Betts finished second in MVP voting in 2016 and finally got to the top Thursday.\n\n\u201cObviously I wanted to win [in 2016], just being in that spot,\u201d Betts said. \u201cYou never know if you\u2019ll ever make it back, so I\u2019m just taking it in. It\u2019s everything I imagined and more.\u201d\n\nYelich grabbed the NL\u2019s top honor by leading the league with a .326 average, a .598 slugging percentage and a 1.000 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. He hit 36 home runs, posted 110 RBI, scored 118 runs and finished with 34 doubles, seven triples and 22 stolen bases. Like Betts, he was a reliable defensive presence in the outfield and anchored a surprising Brewers team that won an NL-high 96 regular season games and finished one victory short of the pennant.\n\nBaez hit .290 with 34 home runs and a league-high 111 RBI. Arenado was right behind him and deGrom finished with a microscopic 1.70 ERA, but the writers decided Yelich was the near-unquestioned choice to stand with Betts above everyone else.\n\n\u201cIf I knew that was going to happen, I would have been a lot less nervous than I actually was,\u201d Yelich said of getting all but one first-place vote. \u201cI was pretty nervous going into it, but obviously I had my friends and family around, and you\u2019re hoping for the best. But it\u2019s an honor.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMets\u2019 Jacob deGrom denies Max Scherzer a third straight Cy Young; Rays\u2019 Blake Snell wins in AL\n\nOakland\u2019s Bob Melvin, Braves\u2019 Brian Snitker win MLB manager of the year awards\n\nNationals\u2019 Juan Soto finishes runner-up for NL rookie of the year to Braves\u2019 Ronald Acuna Jr.\n\nOrioles reportedly choose Astros\u2019 executive Mike Elias as new general manager\n\nThe Nationals-Orioles MASN dispute could finally end this week"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Spencer S.

Friedrich of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected that argument, saying prosecutors properly charged Concord with conspiring to obstruct the lawful functions of the U.S. government by evading foreign election and lobbying disclosure requirements and concealing its interference in the American political process. The company is accused of using a far-reaching fraudulent social media campaign to influence the election.\n\n\u201cConcord\u2019s concerns amount to a single attack: that the government has charged Concord based on conduct that is not illegal,\u201d Friedrich wrote. \u201cBut Concord cannot escape the fact that the course of deceptive conduct alleged is illegal.\u201d\n\nFriedrich added: \u201cThe key question . . . is not whether the defendants\u2019 agreed-upon conduct violated [disclosure laws] \u2014 or any other statute \u2014 but whether it was deceptive and intended to frustrate the lawful government functions\u201d of the Justice and State departments and Federal Election Commission, which regulate foreign involvement. \u201cAt this stage, that is more than enough,\u201d she said.\n\n[Russian troll farm, 13 suspects indicted in 2016 election interference]\n\nThe win for the special counsel came as President Trump and his legal team continue to review a list of written questions posed by Mueller\u2019s team, Trump attorney Rudolph W.

(Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press)\n\nPORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea \u2014 As world leaders land in Papua New Guinea for a Pacific Rim summit, the welcome mat is especially big for China\u2019s president.\n\nA huge sign in the capital, Port Moresby, welcomes Xi Jinping, picturing him gazing beneficently at Papua New Guinea\u2019s leader, and his hotel is decked out with red Chinese lanterns. China\u2019s footprint is everywhere, from a showpiece boulevard and international convention center built with Chinese help to bus stop shelters that announce their origins with \u201cChina Aid\u201d plaques.\n\nOn the eve of Xi\u2019s arrival for a state visit and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, newspapers in the country ran a full-page statement from the Chinese leader. It exhorted Pacific island nations to \u201cset sail on a new voyage\u201d of relations with China, which in the space of a generation has transformed from the world\u2019s most populous backwater into a major economic power.\n\nWith both actions and words, Xi has a compelling message for the South Pacific\u2019s fragile island states, long both propped up and pushed around by U.S. ally Australia: they now have a choice of benefactors. With the exception of Papua New Guinea, those island nations are not part of APEC, but the leaders of many of them have traveled to Port Moresby and will meet with Xi.\n\nThe APEC meeting, meanwhile, is Xi\u2019s to dominate. Headline-hogging leaders such as Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump are not attending. Trump\u2019s stand-in, Vice President Mike Pence, is staying in Cairns in Australia\u2019s north and flying into Papua New Guinea each day. Australia\u2019s new prime minister, Scott Morrison, the country\u2019s fifth leader in five years, is barely known abroad.\n\n\u201cPresident Xi Jinping is a good friend of Papua New Guinea,\u201d its prime minister, Peter O\u2019Neill, told reporters. \u201cHe has had a lot of engagement with Papua New Guinea and I\u2019ve visited China 12 times in the last seven years.\u201d\n\nPacific island nations, mostly tiny, remote and poor, rarely figure prominently on the world stage but have for several years been diligently courted by Beijing as part of its global effort to finance infrastructure that advances its economic and diplomatic interests. Papua New Guinea with about 8 million people is by far the most populous, and with its extensive tropical forests and oil and gas reserves is an obvious target for economic exploitation.\n\nSix of the 16 Pacific island states still have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, a sizeable bloc within the rapidly dwindling number of nations that recognize the island regarded as a renegade province by Beijing. Chinese aid and loans could flip those six into its camp. A military foothold in the region would be an important geostrategic boost for China, though its purported desire for a base has so far been thwarted.\n\nBeijing\u2019s assistance comes without the oversight and conditions that Western nations and organizations such as the World Bank or International Monetary Fund impose. It is promising $4 billion of finance to build the first national road network in Papua New Guinea, which could be transformative for the mountainous nation. But experts warn there could also be big costs later on: unsustainable debt, white elephant showpieces and social tensions from a growing Chinese diaspora.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s engagement in infrastructure in PNG shouldn\u2019t be discounted. It should be encouraged but it needs to be closely monitored by the PNG government to make sure it\u2019s effective over the long term,\u201d said Jonathan Pryke, a Papua New Guinea expert at the Lowy Institute, a think tank in Sydney.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of these projects, because a lot of them are financed by loans, only come from enhanced economic output over a long time to be able to justify paying back these loans,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe history of infrastructure investment in PNG shows that too often there is not enough maintenance going on,\u201d Pryke said. \u201cThere\u2019s a build, neglect, rebuild paradigm in PNG as opposed to build and maintain which is far more efficient.\u201d\n\nSome high-profile Chinese projects in Papua New Guinea have already run into problems. A promised fish cannery hasn\u2019t materialized after several years and expansion of a port in Lae, the major commercial center, was botched and required significant rectification work. Two of the Chinese state companies working in the country, including the company responsible for the port expansion, were until recently blacklisted from World Bank-financed projects because of fraud or corruption.\n\nXi\u2019s newspaper column asserted China is the biggest foreign investor in Papua New Guinea, a statement more aspirational than actual. Its involvement is currently dwarfed by the investment of a single company\u2014 ExxonMobil\u2019s $19 billion natural gas extraction and processing facility.\n\nAustralia, the former colonial power in Papua New Guinea, remains its largest donor of conventional foreign aid. Its assistance, spread across the country and aimed at improving bare bones public services and the capacity of government, is less visible.\n\nBut its approach is shifting in response to China\u2019s moves.\n\nIn September, the Australian government announced it would pay for what is typically a commercial venture \u2014 a high-speed undersea cable linking Australia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands that promises to make the internet and telecommunications in the two island countries faster, more reliable and less expensive.\n\nEarlier this month, Australia announced more than $2 billion of funding for infrastructure and trade finance aimed at Pacific island nations and also agreed to joint development of a naval base in Papua New Guinea, heading off feared Chinese involvement. It is also boosting its diplomatic presence, opening more embassies to be represented in every Pacific island state.\n\n\u201cThe APEC meeting is shaping up to be a faceoff between China and Australia for influence in the Pacific,\u201d said Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch.\n\nThat might seem a positive development for the region, but Pearson cautioned that competition for Papua New Guinea\u2019s vast natural resources has in the past had little positive impact on the lives of its people.\n\n\u201cSadly exploitation of resources in PNG has fueled violent conflict, abuse and environmental devastation,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jim Gomez contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The United States doesn\u2019t recognize abortion as a method of family planning and therefore proposed the amendments, said the spokesperson, who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAustrian Ambassador Jan Kickert, speaking on behalf of the EU, backed the long-agreed U.N. language on \u201csexual and reproductive health\u201d and opposed the U.S. amendments, which he said \u201ccould only have negative consequences impacting first and foremost the most fundamental rights of women, girls and children.\u201d\n\nBritish Ambassador Karen Pierce said, \u201cProtecting children and girls from early and forced marriage, with everything that that entails about sexual and health reproductive rights, is a critical part of economic development \u2014 as the 110 co-sponsors of this resolution have realized.\u201d\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s development agency \u201cprioritizes the promotion of sexual and reproductive health\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s the right thing to do, but it\u2019s also a smart thing to do,\u201d she said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Fox News founder and president died in May 2017. (Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)\n\nMedia critic\n\nDespite his sermonizing about being a positive person, the late Roger Ailes left behind plenty of negatives. There was the divisive politicking that he did on behalf of various Republican politicians decades ago; there was the fearmongering programming that vaulted Fox News to the top of the cable-news pile; and, of course, there was the sexual harassment \u2014 a multi-decade spree that ultimately resulted in Ailes\u2019 ouster from the network in mid-2016.\n\nThat\u2019s too much for anyone to explain in 107 minutes, as attempted by \u201cDivide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes.\u201d The Magnolia Pictures documentary tries to visit all the Ailes waterfronts: There\u2019s tremendous archival footage and photography of Ailes in his early years as a producer on \u201cThe Mike Douglas Show\u201d and Ailes alongside Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Mitch McConnell; there\u2019s superior clip selection of Fox News hosts attempting to push Ailes storylines on air; there\u2019s fine storytelling about peak-Ailes pettiness in attempting to take over a small town in Putnam County, N.Y.\n\nThey\u2019re all sideshows. Of all the Ailes legacies \u2014 a divided country, eroded factual commonality, ratings-driven filth \u2014 none resounds so much as the first-person accounts of his victims. The names, by now, are familiar and numerous: Gretchen Carlson uncorked the gushing geyser with her July 2016 lawsuit claiming that Ailes had sexually harassed her. Then came more and more names, including then-star host Megyn Kelly and longtime Fox News employee Laurie Luhn, who had alleged a twisted form of torment applied by Ailes. New York Magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman counted more than two dozen accusers in September 2016. Showtime is doing an 8-part series on Ailes based on Sherman\u2019s book \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room,\u201d starring Russell Crowe as the network executive.\n\nMarketing consultant Kellie Boyle speaks in \u201cDivide and Conquer\u201d about how she revered Ailes. \u201cI\u2019d read his book and, in my industry, he was the man,\u201d she tells the camera. She had dinner at Union Station with Ailes, after which he said that he could help Boyle. But: \u201cIf you want to play with the big boys, you have to lay with the big boys,\u201d Ailes said, according to Boyle. She didn\u2019t accept Ailes\u2019 advances, and later found out that she had been blacklisted for a big job that she had hoped to secure. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting any of my calls returned,\u201d says Boyle. A friend figured out that she was on a \u201cno-hire list.\u201d \u201cThat was the end of my career,\u201d Boyle recounts.\n\nThe film, directed by Alexis Bloom, moves from that anecdote to a 1992 clip of Ailes telling interviewer Charlie Rose: \u201cIf you want to have tremendous political influence and still be a womanizer, drug abuser or an alcoholic, you only have one choice of career, and that\u2019s journalism, because journalists won\u2019t attack each other. They only attack all the rest of us.\u201d Rose \u2014 who these days often finds himself paired in news coverage with Ailes, Bill O\u2019Reilly and other predator types \u2014 gets a good chuckle out of the remark.\n\nAlisyn Camerota, who escaped Fox News for a real-news career at CNN, talked about her request for more responsibility. \u201cI wanted to try to anchor \u2014 I think that he saw that as, \u2018What do I get out of that?\u2019 And so when I went to him to ask him for more opportunity, he said, \u2018Well, I\u2019d have to work with you more closely . . . I\u2019d have to train you, give you sort of tutorials. People might be jealous, and so . . . it would be best if we did it away from here, perhaps at a hotel sometime. Do you know what I\u2019m saying?\u2019 \u201d Camerota did know what he was saying, and she knew she would never do such a thing, as she explains: \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen next. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to be fired if I didn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t know how he was going to make that happen. I mean, Roger was the king. His assistant was the head of [Human Resources]. And so it didn\u2019t occur to me that there was somebody higher than Roger who could have done something. There wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFormer TV correspondent Lidia Curanaj talks about how Ailes, during a job interview, told her that a Fox News woman had to have \u201cthe entire package. People want to see a woman from head to toe. And he looked me up and down admiringly and said you definitely are beautiful enough to be here,\u201d recalls Curanaj, who said that Ailes requested the infamous \u201ctwirl\u201d so that he could see all of her. \u201cI just looked at him and laughed,\u201d she says. She didn\u2019t get the job.\n\nWhen the mushroom cloud of sexual-harassment allegations fell upon Fox News, it was craziness, as the film demonstrates. The situation is narrated by Karen Kessler and Warren Cooper of PR firm Evergreen Partners. These folks add a little perspective to the scramble to stack up favorable comments about Ailes by Fox News talent, particularly high-profile women. Kessler: \u201cThey said all statements will be run through Irena Briganti, the head of public relations for Fox, who he told us was a \u2018stone killer.\u2019 And she was intensely focused on getting as many of the highest profile, and frankly, best looking, women on Fox to say that indeed he was not a harasser . . . And Irena was really proud that, in one day, she was able to enlist 22 people . . . \u2018We\u2019re up to 22, Roger.\u2019 \u201d Toward the end of the film, Kessler notes that she doesn\u2019t speak about her clients, though an exception was in order here: \u201cIn this case not only did we not have a contract, not only did we not have [a nondisclosure agreement], not only did we not have any legal reasons why we couldn\u2019t \u2014 or get paid \u2014 but it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s so wrong, and I can\u2019t be part of that. And not only am I not going to be part of that, but I\u2019m going to expose it so that these men one day can get some of what they deserve.

(Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un observed the successful test of an unspecified \u201cnewly developed ultramodern tactical weapon,\u201d state media reported Friday, in an apparent bid to apply pressure on the United States and South Korea.\n\nIt didn\u2019t appear to be a test of a nuclear device or a long-range missile with the potential to target the U.S. A string of such tests last year had many fearing war before the North turned to engagement and diplomacy. Still, any mention of weapons testing could influence the direction of stalled diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Washington and aimed at ridding the North of its nuclear weapons.\n\nThe North hasn\u2019t publicly tested any weapons since November 2017, but in recent days Pyongyang reportedly expressed anger at U.S.-led international sanctions and ongoing small-scale military drills between South Korea and the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry warned it could bring back its policy of bolstering its nuclear arsenal if it doesn\u2019t receive sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s North Korea-style coercive diplomacy. North Korea is saying \u2018If you don\u2019t listen to us, you will face political burdens,\u2019\u201d said analyst Shin Beomchul of Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nDiplomacy has stalled since a summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in June, with Washington pushing for more action on nuclear disarmament and the North insisting that the U.S. first approve a peace declaration formally ending the Korean War and lift sanctions.\n\nShin said the weapon North Korea tested could be a missile, artillery, an anti-air gun, a drone or other high-tech conventional weapons systems.\n\nYang Wook, a Seoul-based military expert, said a \u201ctactical weapon\u201d in North Korea refers to \u201ca weapon aimed at striking South Korea including U.S. military bases\u201d there, so the North may have tested a short-range missile or a multiple rocket launch system.\n\nEven if the test was a message for Washington and Seoul, Friday\u2019s report from the North was noticeably less belligerent than past announcements of weapons tests, and didn\u2019t focus on North Korean claims of U.S. and South Korean hostility.\n\nYang said the latest North Korean test won\u2019t completely break down nuclear diplomacy, though more questions would be raised about how sincere the North is about its commitment to denuclearization.\n\nAsked about the test, the U.S. State Department said that American and North Korean officials are talking about implementing the commitments that Trump and Kim made during their June meeting in Singapore. Eugene Lee, spokeswoman of South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, declined to comment on Kim\u2019s inspection of the weapons test.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, attending a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore, cited the \u201cgreat progress\u201d made on North Korea but said more had to be done.\n\nA year and a half ago, \u201cnuclear tests were taking place, missiles were flying over Japan and there were threats and propagations against our nation and nations in the region,\u201d Pence said.\n\n\u201cToday, no more missiles are flying, no more nuclear tests, our hostages have come home, and North Korea has begun anew to return fallen American heroes from the Korean War to our soil. We made great progress but there\u2019s more work to be done,\u201d he said.\n\nPence stressed that U.N. sanctions had to remain enforced.\n\nIt\u2019s the first publicly known field inspection of a weapons test by Kim Jong Un since he observed the testing of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile in November of last year, according to South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry.\n\nThe North said the test took place at the Academy of National Defense Science and that Kim couldn\u2019t suppress his \u201cpassionate joy\u201d at its success. He was described as \u201cso excited to say that another great work was done by the defense scientists and munitions industrial workers to increase the defense capability of the country.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s string of increasingly powerful weapons tests, many experts believe, put the North on the brink of a viable arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles that can target anywhere in the mainland United States.\n\nTrump and Kim are both interested in another summit, but it\u2019s unclear when it might happen. Pence has said the next meeting would allow the two leaders to put what they discussed in their last summit on paper.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, Annabelle Liang in Singapore and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Dar Yasin/Associated Press)\n\nCOX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh \u2014 Normal life returned to a Rohingya Muslim refugee camp in Bangladesh on Friday, a day after government authorities postponed plans to begin repatriating residents to Myanmar when no one volunteered to go.\n\nUnited Nations officials and international aid agencies praised the government of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who hopes to retain power in elections next month, for upholding a commitment not to force the repatriation.\n\nHasina has repeatedly discussed the toll on Bangladesh of hosting more than a million Rohingya \u2014 including more than 700,000 who fled military-led violence in Myanmar since August 2017 and tens of thousands of others who escaped previous bouts of violence and persecution.\n\nResidents of Cox\u2019s Bazar district often complain that they have been undercut by refugees willing to work illegally for lower wages. Thousands of acres (hectares) of national forests usually roamed by wild elephants have been taken over by the cramped and unsanitary camps.\n\nBut Hasina\u2019s decision not to force the repatriation is unlikely to hurt her bid to win a third term in December, according to Pinak Chakravarty, India\u2019s former ambassador to Bangladesh and a fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe people of Bangladesh are sympathetic to the plight of the Rohingya. Apart from the fact that they\u2019re refugees, they\u2019re fellow Muslims. She understands that these feelings are strong, and that is why I think she would not force anyone to go,\u201d he said.\n\nAs it became apparent that refugees were unlikely be sent back, tensions eased in the camps. The checkpoints at the entrance to Unchiprang, one of the refugee camps near the city of Cox\u2019s Bazar, were temporarily left unguarded on Friday morning as about 500 people crowded into a mosque for Friday prayers.\n\nOne of the imams, Abdul Hakim, told the devotees that the government could not force Rohingya to go back without Myanmar guaranteeing them protection and civil rights, to which they raised their hands and replied, \u201cAmen.\u201d\n\nHundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh from western Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state since last year to escape killings and destruction of their villages by the military and Buddhist vigilantes that have drawn widespread condemnation of Myanmar.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s refugee commission had planned to begin a voluntary repatriation process under a United Nations-brokered deal with Myanmar by escorting about 150 refugees across the border on Thursday, despite calls by U.N. officials, Human Rights Watch and others to wait until the Rohingya\u2019s safety in Myanmar could be assured.\n\nU.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said earlier this week that the agency continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in Rakhine, including \u201callegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests,\u201d as well as widespread restrictions on freedom of movement, health and education.\n\nFearful of returning home, some people on Bangladesh\u2019s repatriation list left their shanties and disappeared into other camps.\n\nAfter a demonstration involving about 1,000 Rohingya broke out at Unchiprang, Refugee Commissioner Abul Kalam said plans had been shelved because no refugees were willing to return.\n\nKalam did not immediately return calls and messages on Friday, and it was unclear when the process would begin again.\n\nNabi Hossain, 45, left his shanty at Unchiprang camp late Wednesday with his wife, Jamila Begum, and six other family members after noticing extra security at the camp.\n\n\u201cWe heard they will come and take us. We were in a panic,\u201d Hossain said, adding that the family slept outside and didn\u2019t eat much because they didn\u2019t want a cooking fire to attract attention.\n\nThey returned Thursday after hearing about the protest.\n\n\u201cIf they allow us to have our rights, our citizenship, we want to go. But if we are forced, if our rights are not given, it is better to crush us under the wheels of cars or be thrown in a river,\u201d Hossain said.\n\nNot everyone who fled Unchiprang has returned.\n\nJohara, 30, a mother of five, said her husband left five days ago with their 6-year-old daughter, who was traumatized after witnessing Myanmar soldiers ransack their home village.\n\n\u201cMy daughter is terrified. She told her father to take her with him,\u201d she said.\n\nJohara, who goes by one name, said her husband left to find his parents at another camp after she gave an interview to aid workers, and the family found out they were on the government\u2019s repatriation list.\n\nWhile Johara waited for her husband and daughter to return, activity at Unchiprang returned to normal, with little sign of the aid workers, journalists or government officials who had swarmed the camp earlier in the week.\n\nEven as refugees in Bangladesh protested against repatriation, concerns grew that another Rohingya exodus from Myanmar by sea may be in the works.\n\nAuthorities in Myanmar arrested 106 people, believed to be Rohingya, whose boat drifted to shore Friday morning in Kyauktan township, south of Yangon, during what they said was an effort to sail to Malaysia.\n\nOne of the people detained, who did not give his name, told reporters that the group came from a displacement camp for Rohingya near Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine. He said the group departed on Oct. 25, and one passenger, a 20-year-old woman, had died of hunger.\n\nThe boat drifted to shore after they decided to return to Rakhine because of the lack of supplies and tried to turn it around, he said.\n\nSittwe is a frequent exit point for Rohingya seeking to make the dangerous and illegal voyage by sea to Malaysia, which is a Muslim majority country which generally tolerates their arrival.\n\nIn 2015, a mass of such journeys caused a regional crisis, especially as the policy of some nations, especially Thailand, was to turn away the boats, even when those aboard were in desperate circumstances. Unknown hundreds of refugees are believed to have perished at sea. Several boats made the same voyage in April this year.\n\nAnother boat believed to be carrying Rohingya refugees was sighted Friday near Indonesia.\n\nMuhammad Nasir, who heads a disaster mitigation office in the northern part of Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra island, said fishermen reported seeing a wooden boat carrying about 80 people believed to be Rohingyas.\n\nMeenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said Friday that the continued Rohingya flight from Myanmar shows that Bangladesh\u2019s repatriation plans should remain shelved.\n\n\u201cMyanmar might claim that it is ready to receive the refugees, but the truth is that the conditions are not safe, and the Rohingya cannot make a decision about voluntary returns until human rights protections are guaranteed with international monitoring, and there is accountability for the horrible abuses by the military,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Min Kyi Thein in Kyauktan, Myanmar, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bill Nelson (D) by 12,562 votes in the Florida Senate race. A margin of victory that large has never be overturned in a recount. According to FairVote, the average vote shift in statewide general election recounts is a meager 282 votes. \u201cThe biggest swing came in Florida\u2019s 2000 presidential election recount, when Al Gore cut 1,247 votes off George W. Bush\u2019s lead, ultimately not enough to flip the state to his column,\u201d according to a FiveThirtyEight report on what FairVote found.\n\nSo even if Nelson were to swing 10 times as many votes in this recount as Gore did in 2000, he would still come up short. Democrats know that recounting the existing votes is unlikely to change the result. So Democrats have filed a series of lawsuits asking courts to change Florida elections laws after the fact. The result would be that they can count ineligible votes in the hope that these will provide the margin necessary to overcome Scott\u2019s lead. For example, Florida statute mandates that, with the exception of overseas and military voters, vote-by-mail ballots are counted only if they are \u201creceived by the supervisor of elections not later than 7 p.m. on the day of the election.\u201d But Nelson has sued demanding that mail ballots that arrived after the 7 p.m. deadline to be counted as part of the recount.\n\nSimilarly, Florida law says mail and provisional ballots are counted only if the signatures on them match the signatures that elections offices have on record. If there is a signature mismatch, the voter is notified and can \u201ccomplete and submit an affidavit in order to cure the vote-by-mail ballot until 5 p.m. on the day before the election\u201d (emphasis added). But Democrats are asking a judge to throw that law out and count ballots with signatures that don\u2019t match the voter signature on file.\n\nFederal prosecutors are investigating charges that Florida Democratic Party officials urged voters to fix their ballots after Election Day, including evidence that they changed official state election documents to indicate that ballots could be returned after the polls had closed. Initial reports indicated this was limited to a handful of counties, but a new report in the Naples Daily News has uncovered emails showing that \u201cFlorida Democrats were organizing a broader statewide effort beyond those counties to give voters the altered forms\u201d with the goal to \u201cfix and submit as many absentee ballots as possible with the altered forms in hopes of later including them in vote totals if a judge ruled such ballots were allowed.\u201d\n\nFlorida law also instructs the Department of State to \u201cadopt specific rules . . . prescribing what constitutes a \u2018clear indication on the ballot that the voter has made a definite choice.\u2019 \u201d The Department of State has done so, providing clear standards for determining whether a voter intended to vote for a particular candidate. Now Democratic lawyers are asking a judge to order Florida to ignore this intent standard when reviewing \u201cunder votes,\u201d so they can add ballots that do not qualify under Florida law.\n\nWhile national Democrats sue in the courts to change election law after the election, local Democratic officials running the recount are accused of engaging in serious irregularities. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Democrat-leaning Broward County submitted vote totals that include ballots disqualified by the canvassing board, while Palm Beach was rebuked by a judge after it duplicated 650 ballots without submitting them to canvassing board.\n\nThere is also evidence that officials in Democrat-leaning Broward Country have been dragging their feet in carrying out the recount. Miami-Dade \u2014 the most populous county in the state \u2014 was halfway done with its entire recount by Monday morning and easily met the 3 p.m. Thursday deadline required by law. But by Monday evening, Broward County had not yet started its recount. And on Thursday, Palm Beach failed to meet the legal deadline.\n\nThese counties\u2019 problems could have many different possible causes, including incompetence, or fraud, or both.

(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nHumanity just made a weighty decision. On Friday, representatives of more than 60 nations, gathered in Versailles, France, approved a new definition for the kilogram.\n\nSince the 19th century, scientists have based their definition of the fundamental unit of mass on a physical object \u2014 a shining platinum iridium cylinder stored in a locked vault in the bowels of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Sevres, France. A kilogram was equal to the heft of this aging hunk of metal, and this cylinder, by definition, weighed exactly a kilogram. If the cylinder changed, even a little bit, then the entire global system of measurement had to change, too.\n\nWith Friday\u2019s vote, scientists redefined the kilogram for the 21st century by tying it to a fundamental feature of the universe \u2014 a small, strange figure from quantum physics known as Planck\u2019s constant, which describes the smallest possible unit of energy.\n\nExperts redefined the kilogram Nov. 16 -- ditching a relic made of a platinum-iridium alloy for something more up to date. (Reuters)\n\nThanks to Albert Einstein\u2019s revelation that energy and mass are related, determining exactly how much energy is in that unit can let scientists define mass in terms of Planck\u2019s constant \u2014 a value that should hold up across space and time \u2014 rather than relying on an inconstant metal cylinder. (Mass determines something\u2019s weight, and for most purposes mass and weight are interchangeable.)\n\nThe redefinition is the result of a decades-long, worldwide quest to measure Planck\u2019s constant precisely enough that the number would stand up to scientific scrutiny.\n\nThough the newly defined kilogram won\u2019t affect your bathroom scale, it will have practical applications in research and industries that depend on meticulous measurement.\n\nFriday\u2019s vote was mostly a formality; everyone involved knew the resolution would pass. But to Jon Pratt, one of the leaders of that global effort, the event was about more than symbolism, bigger than business and beyond even physics.\n\nIn this era of violence and vitriol, when it seems there\u2019s so little on which people can agree, Pratt said, the redefinition represents something sublime.\n\nIt is an acknowledgment of an immutable truth \u2014 that nature has laws to which all of us are subject. And it\u2019s one more step toward a lofty dream \u2014 that, in understanding nature\u2019s laws, scientists can help build a better world.\n\nThe scientist grinned, sheepish. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just really proud of our species.\u201d\n\n\n\nA kilogram standard at NIST. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nThe watt balance at NIST. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nLeaving behind \u2018Le Grand K\u2019\n\nAt the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Md., where Pratt works, measurement is often described as the \u201cinvisible infrastructure\u201d of the modern world. Everything a person does \u2014 whether it\u2019s checking a clock, forecasting the weather, cooking a meal, building a rocket, signing a contract, waging a war \u2014 requires measurements of some kind.\n\nThe International System of Units, or SI, is what allows us\n\nto communicate measurements around the globe. This system, which has its origins in the heady days of the Enlightenment, was meant to end the bickering over the number of Spanish vara in a British furlong and ease the anxieties of a merchant who bought goods in the Netherlands, where the unit of weight was based on the amount of fish that could fit in a ship\u2019s hold, and sold them in France, where weight was tied to the heft of a wheat grain.\n\nThe motto of one of the system\u2019s creators, \u201cfor all times and for all people,\u201d is among Pratt\u2019s favorite phrases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an optimistic view,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cHe just imagined this business of science . . . was going to be a great force for freedom and a great force for moving the world forward.\u201d\n\nIn 1875, the signing of the Treaty of the Metre made the system official. Two platinum and iridium prototypes \u2014 a meter-length bar and a kilogram-mass cylinder \u2014 were forged to serve as the standard units for the whole world. The BIPM distributed copies of each prototype to the signatory nations; the century-old U.S. national kilogram still sits in a glass case in a locked room down the hall from Pratt\u2019s lab.\n\nAs science and commerce advanced, the SI expanded to include units for other kinds of measurements and the definitions were revised to allow for greater and greater precision. The meter prototype was ditched in favor of the distance light travels in a vacuum in one 299,792,458th of a second. The length of a second was pegged to the cycles of radiation of the element cesium.\n\nThese values \u2014 the speed of light, the behavior of atoms, the nature of electromagnetism \u2014 are fundamental features of nature that do not change whether the observer is on Earth or Mars, whether it\u2019s the year 1875 or 2018.\n\nBut the kilogram prototype, known as \u201cLe Grand K,\u201d was made by humans and is subject to all our limitations. It is inaccessible \u2014 the safe containing the cylinder can be opened only by three custodians carrying three separate keys, an event that has happened fewer than a dozen times in the object\u2019s 139-year history. And it is inconsistent \u2014 when Le Grand K was examined in the 1980s, it weighed several micrograms less than it was supposed to. This meant that anyone who made products based on the standards had to reissue their weights. Manufacturers were furious. Lawmakers were called. Metrologists, people who study measurements, were accused of incompetence.\n\nSo, in a 2014 meeting at the BIPM, the metrology community resolved to redefine the kilogram. But the value of Planck\u2019s constant was still uncertain, and scientists couldn\u2019t redefine the kilogram without it.\n\n\n\nTwo one-kilogram weights on a vintage scale in Saussay-la-Campagne, France. (Christian Hartmann/Reuters)\n\n\u2018Chasing perfection\u2019\n\nIt has been more than 100 years since the quantum physicist Max Planck discovered that energy is expressed in discrete units \u2014 that is, it\u2019s \u201cquantized.\u201d But his constant \u2014 a figure that describes the size of these energy packets \u2014 has been hard to pin down.\n\nThere are only two experimental setups that allow scientists to calculate this number, and both require rare and expensive tools.\n\nOne technique involves counting all the atoms in a perfectly round silicon sphere.\n\nThe second option uses an exquisitely accurate weighing machine known as a watt balance, which measures an object\u2019s mass by calculating the force needed to lift it. This is no ordinary scale; it took a pair of British scientists several decades to invent and refine the instrument, and there are only two in the world powerful enough to meet the BIPM\u2019s high standards for precision.\n\nOne is in Canada. The other sits inside Pratt\u2019s lab in the NIST basement.\n\n\u201cIt really is a beautiful instrument,\u201d Pratt said during a recent visit to the steel-encased room where the balance is stored. \u201cI like to just come here and stare at it.\u201d\n\nThe enormous metal machine, which took five years to build, is as tall as a professional basketball player and shiny as a disco ball, with a tungsten carbide fulcrum on which the balance hinges and a one-ton magnet that helps generate a force. While experiments are run, the entire balance is placed inside a vacuum chamber. Anyone who operates the instrument must wear a hairnet, a lab coat and bootees. Pratt and his colleagues measure every factor that could possibly affect their result, from the temperature of the room to the strength of Earth\u2019s gravity.\n\n\u201cIn a physics sense, we\u2019re really chasing perfection here,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cWe really need things to behave just as their idealized versions.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 resolution required that at least one instrument would need to calculate Planck\u2019s constant to an uncertainty of just 20 parts per billion \u2014 or within 0.000002 percent of what is thought to be the correct number.\n\nOn June 30, 2017, the day before the deadline to submit a value to the BIPM\u2019s weights and measures committee, Pratt and his team finally published a result that met this standard.\n\nPlanck\u2019s constant is equal to 6.626069934 x 10-34 kg\u2219m2/s, they said. And their uncertainty was just 13 parts per billion.\n\nThat number may be barely intelligible to the casual observer. But to Pratt, measuring it felt for a moment like some cosmic curtain had been lifted, revealing the innermost workings of the universe.\n\nHere in the echoing basement of an obscure federal agency, he and his crew of hair-netted nerds had gotten as close to one standard for perfection as any human has ever been. They had transcended their human biases and earthly flaws to make an observation so precise it will work \u201cfor all times and for all people\u201d \u2014 or at least, until the day when scientists are able to pull back another fold of the curtain, eliminating one more degree of uncertainty about this fundamental fact of physics.\n\nPratt and his colleagues are not the only scientists who have spent the better part of the past decade in pursuit of Planck\u2019s constant. Researchers using the watt balance in Canada have achieved a measurement with even less uncertainty than NIST\u2019s. Teams in Germany and Japan produced similarly precise measurements using the silicon-sphere technique.\n\nBut not all the measurements agreed. In the metrology community, where careers can be staked on quibbles over decimal points, this discrepancy could have been catastrophic. \u201cThere was a lot of hemming and hawing, and at one point there were questions about whether [the vote] would even happen,\u201d Pratt said.\n\nBut that debate, too, was an important part of the process. Only through repeated observations, refutations and confirmations does an idea become a globally accepted fact. It\u2019s what makes science bigger than scientists; it\u2019s how we establish that something is true.\n\nStill, Pratt didn\u2019t wait for the debate to end to get NIST\u2019s value for Planck\u2019s constant tattooed on his forearm \u2014 the 10-digit number and an illustration of a statue clutching a meter bar and a kilogram cylinder. And above it, in French, were the words that have guided metrologists since the beginning: A tous les temps, a tous les peuples.\n\nFor all times, for all people."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Rob Harris | AP", "title": "Pulisic back as US loses 3-0 at England; no goal for Rooney", "description": "Christian Pulisic played just his second match with the U.S. national team in 13 months, and the Americans failed to muster much of an attack in a 3-0 loss to England that marked Wayne Rooney\u2019s farewell with the Three Lions", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/pulisic-back-as-us-loses-3-0-at-england-no-goal-for-rooney/2018/11/15/b18bc4ee-e936-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:29:36Z", "content": "LONDON Christian Pulisic played just his second match with the U.S. national team in 13 months, and the Americans failed to muster much of an attack in a 3-0 loss to England on Thursday night that marked Wayne Rooneys farewell with the Three Lions.

A short while later, Pulisic lost the ball and Jesse Lingard gave England the lead. Just 104 seconds later, Trent Alexander-Arnold doubled the advantage.\n\n\u201cWe need to get a lot better if we want to beat a good side like that,\u201d Pulisic said after Thursday night\u2019s 3-0 defeat. \u201cWe\u2019re not happy with the result.\u201d\n\nCallum Wilson beat Brad Guzan in the 77th minute, and Wayne Rooney entered in the 58th minute in his English national team farewell.

This marked the first joint appearance by Pulisic and midfielders Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Tyler Adams, who entered in the 62nd minute.\n\nSarachan deployed Pulisic on a wing, where Borussia Dortmund used the 20-year-old midfielder.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always going to be a debate,\u201d Sarachan said. \u201cYou have arguably our best player and so most would think, well, we should use him in the middle of the field, and I\u2019m not saying maybe that won\u2019t happen, but I also know that when you watch him play for his club in the position he plays, he\u2019s very dangerous in confined space, so our thinking tonight was let\u2019s put him in a comfortable spot, having the freedom to cut inside and make the game, and I think there were moments when he did.\u201d\n\nSarachan\u2019s successor will face the same question.\n\n\u201cI think as we move along, as this program moves along, as players around him get settled and allow him maybe more freedom as a central guy, that\u2019s probably a place that would make sense,\u201d Sarachan said.\n\nU.S. center backs John Brooks and Matt Miazga had trouble closing down England, a World Cup semifinalist, and the Americans dropped to three wins, four losses and four ties under Sarachan going into his likely finale, against Italy on Tuesday at Genk, Belgium.\n\nRooney, who joined Major League Soccer\u2019s D.C. United in July, made his 120th international appearance, the most among England outfield players. The best chance for the 33-year-old striker was in stoppage time, when his low shot was saved by Guzan to the frustration of a crowd of 68,155. Rooney finished with an England record 53 goals.\n\n\u201cAnother yard it would have been in ... and it would have great,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cBut in some ways it\u2019s great because if I did score it would have opened another whole lot of debate whether that goal should count or not. In some ways it\u2019s probably better it didn\u2019t go in.\u201d\n\nEngland went ahead in the 25th minute when Dele Alli took the ball into the corner and passed to Lingard the top of the penalty area. Lingard took a touch as Miazga failed to close him down, then lofted the ball to the far corner over Guzan\u2019s outstretched arm.\n\nWilson dribbled into the penalty area in the 27th at Brooks and Miazga. The ball bounded out to Jadon Sancho, who passed to an unrushing Alexander-Arnold. Brooks failed to challenge him and Alexander-Arnold beat Guzan to the far post from with an angled shot from 10 yards.\n\nWilson scored off a pass from Fabian Delph, beating Brooks to a cross and putting in a volley from 7 yards. Wilson and Alexander-Arnold scored their first international goals.\n\n\u201cProbably gave them too much respect in the first half,\u201d Guzan said. \u201cUltimately we were outclassed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Whitaker has privately voiced concerns directly to President Trump about a new bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, according to a GOP senator Whitaker met with Thursday, amid growing opposition to the legislation Trump endorsed with much fanfare this week.\n\nWhitaker has concerns with the \u201cdrug part of the bill,\u201d according to Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), and has spoken about the concerns with the National Narcotic Officers\u2019 Associations\u2019 Coalition. Whitaker\u2019s particular concern is how the bill would change drug sentences, and he told Graham that he has also expressed his issues with the bill to the president.\n\n\u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t want to kill it,\u201d Graham said Thursday. \u201cHe just wanted to express his concerns.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said only that Whitaker and Graham had a \u201cgood meeting.\u201d\n\nThe bill, formally introduced Thursday evening, would make a number of significant changes to sentencing laws. For example, it would lower mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, including reducing the \u201cthree strikes\u201d penalty from life behind bars to 25 years. It would also reduce mandatory minimum sentences that go into effect when a firearm is used during a violent crime or drug offense.\n\nGraham said that Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior White House adviser, had persuaded the president to support the bill, and that he was impressed with Kushner.\n\nYet Whitaker\u2019s private concerns have also been voiced publicly by some of Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill, who are nonetheless vehemently opposed to any efforts to ease mandatory minimum sentencing laws.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who has been in continual contact with the White House throughout the year on the issue, stressed earlier Thursday that, while he had not yet seen the text, \u201cat the height of the drug epidemic in our country, we should not be cutting sentences for serious drug traffickers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had productive conversations all year long,\u201d Cotton said of his discussions with the White House. \u201cIn the end, we have a principled disagreement on it, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll end up.\u201d\n\nThe legislation also faced more setbacks on Thursday when the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association and several other law enforcement groups released a letter announcing that they would oppose the criminal justice overhaul bill \u201cin its current form.\u201d The measure\u2019s supporters had hoped the sheriffs group would at least stay neutral on the bill to improve its prospects among Republicans \u2014 and with Trump, who has privately indicated that he would like to see more law enforcement groups endorse the measure.\n\nStill, the influential Fraternal Order of Police supports it, as do groups such as the National District Attorneys Association and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get everyone,\u201d said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the chief Democratic author of the bill, who had discussions with White House officials on Thursday. But \u201cwe\u2019re not gonna get everybody.\u201d\n\nSenate Republican leaders, who control the floor schedule, have also been publicly noncommittal. The bill\u2019s supporters are now scrambling to round up votes to show Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that the legislation has more than enough support to pass the chamber.\n\nBut McConnell\u2019s top deputy, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.), echoed a message McConnell relayed earlier this week: that the Senate is simply running out of time.\n\n\u201cI support getting the bill some floor time and getting it to move forward,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cI\u2019m a little skeptical about our ability to do that during a lame-duck, absent consent . . . nothing happens quickly around here.\u201d\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) met privately with several key House lawmakers pushing criminal justice reform earlier Thursday, to ensure that the compromise officially unveiled Thursday could pass the House in the coming weeks if the Senate clears it. Among those in the meeting were Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strong step in the right direction, and we\u2019re hopeful that the Senate is going to act sooner rather than later to begin the process of ending mass incarceration in America,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cDoug Collins and I are both confident that if the Senate moves on the proposal that is currently before them that includes sentencing reform, that we\u2019d have a strong bipartisan vote in the House and can send the bill to the president.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Fareed Zakaria", "title": "What effect does the Trump circus have on the world?", "description": "The president\u2019s lack of interest will feed the fear of China\u2019s ascendancy.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/what-effect-does-the-trump-circus-have-on-the-world/2018/11/15/79e36872-e921-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tXSi-d7do4Y8VOBlw02peNnvxqg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6D4NKKXJFEI6RKJZSRU7CFTPTU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:27:15Z", "content": "Its easy to get distracted by the circus of the Trump presidency.

For an answer to that question, take a look at three gatherings this week on the other side of the planet.\n\nAttended by all of the major Asian countries, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia summits in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Papua New Guinea are particularly important, because countries in the region are trying to navigate the once-in-a-lifetime power shift taking place: the rise of China. For this, it is crucial that they understand the role of the world\u2019s current superpower, the United States.\n\nBut the president of the United States is MIA. Donald Trump chose to skip the summits and send Vice President Pence in his place. Yet China\u2019s Xi Jinping, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and India\u2019s Narendra Modi are all visiting either Singapore or Papua New Guinea, while Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe and South Korea\u2019s Moon Jae-in are traveling to both. Really, everyone except President Trump is going.\n\nA persistent complaint from Asian countries has been that while the United States worries about the rise of China \u2014 as Pence did in his speech at the ASEAN summit \u2014 it is abandoning the field to Beijing. It does not take the time to attend meetings, shape the agenda, shore up its alliances or deepen its ties in the region. Trump\u2019s continued lack of interest will only feed this fear.\n\nWe are seeing the Trump effect in the retreat on trade in Asia. The two mechanisms for greater prosperity and cooperation that were moving toward completion in the region had been the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) . Trump pulled the United States out of the TPP, undermining the pact\u2019s goal of giving Asian countries an alternative to a Chinese-dominated system. The RCEP, which includes China, is also meant to open up Asian economies and increase commerce and contact in the region. But after 24 rounds of negotiations, momentum appears to have slowed, perhaps even stalled.\n\nIndia is trying to protect its market from Chinese imports, other countries are trying to keep India\u2019s service industries out and everyone can take solace that this is all simply an echo of what the world\u2019s superpower, the United States, is doing in its own trade negotiations.\n\nI\u2019ve written before, and continue to believe, that the Trump administration has a valid point about China\u2019s abuse of the trading system and is right to get tough with Beijing. But it is grossly mistaken in its instinctive opposition to trade, repeatedly voiced by the president. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t trade, we\u2019d save a hell of a lot of money,\u201d Trump said in a speech in July, a statement that is simply false. According to calculations by Gary Hufbauer and Lucy Lu of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , the expansion of trade since 1950 increased U.S. gross domestic product to the tune of $2.1 trillion in 2016. That is equivalent to a gain of $7,014 per person, or $18,131 per household.\n\nTo watch India\u2019s government now try to protect its markets and raise tariffs is a sad case of a country that appears to have forgotten its own history. India has decades of experience with high tariffs, which were designed to give its domestic industries a boost. The result was uncompetitive companies, shoddy products, widespread corruption and economic stagnation. Then, in the early 1990s, it slashed tariffs and red tape, ushering in three decades as the world\u2019s second-fastest-growing large economy, lifting more than 150 million people out of extreme poverty. Does it really want to try to make Indian socialism great again?\n\nFew ideas have been as thoroughly tested through history as the notion that trade raises a country\u2019s income and living standards. It can also create habits of cooperation, even peace, as it has done in Europe and as it might help do in Asia. American leaders understood that for decades, until now. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan warned, \u201cWe should beware of the demagogues who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends \u2014 weakening our economy, our national security and the entire free world \u2014 all while cynically waving the American flag. The expansion of the international economy is not a foreign invasion; it is an American triumph, one we worked hard to achieve, and something central to our vision of a peaceful and prosperous world of freedom.\u201d\n\nRead more from Fareed Zakaria\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his daily newsletter."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Croatia beats Spain to set up Nations showdown with England", "description": "Croatia\u2019s thrilling 3-2 win over Spain has left both sides and group rival England with a chance of reaching the final phase of the UEFA Nations League", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/croatia-beats-spain-to-set-up-nations-showdown-with-england/2018/11/15/1cb25424-e935-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:18:16Z", "content": "Croatia crushed Englands World Cup hopes in July.

By beating Spain in a thriller on Thursday, the Croats have given Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad a chance to advance to the final phase of the inaugural UEFA Nations League.\n\nTin Jedvaj scored his second goal three minutes into stoppage time to earn Croatia a 3-2 victory and a first win in a competitive match since beating England in the World Cup semifinals.\n\nSpain remained atop League A, Group 4 with six points. England and Croatia have four points each ahead of their head-to-head meeting at Wembley Stadium on Sunday in the last match.\n\nA win for either England or Croatia will assure qualifying for the Final Four in June along with the other three group winners. Spain would go through if England and Croatia draw. The bottom team will be relegated to League B.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to win this and to have the last match at Wembley to decide the group winner,\u201d Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic said. \u201cLet\u2019s go and enjoy our football now. We are very motivated for that one.\u201d\n\nWhile Croatia beat former world champion Spain, England eased to a 3-0 win over the United States in a friendly marking the farewell appearance of Wayne Rooney.\n\nElsewhere in the Nations League, Belgium beat Iceland 2-0 to stay on course to reach the finals. In the lower leagues, Bosnia and Herzegovina earned promotion to League A, and Finland earned promotion to League B.\n\nIn other friendlies, Germany routed Russia 3-0, the Czech Republic edged Poland 1-0, Ireland and Northern Ireland played to a 0-0 draw, and Israel thrashed Guatemala 7-0.\n\nCroatia\u2019s win avenged a 6-0 loss, its worst ever, to Spain in September.\n\nThe World Cup finalists pressed Spain in its area late and Jedvaj pounced after goalkeeper David de Gea pushed the ball into his path. The Bayer Leverkusen defender had earlier made it 2-1 to the hosts when he was left unmarked to head in a cross by Luka Modric for his first international goal.\n\nSpain twice rallied to equalize, first through Dani Ceballos canceling out Andrej Kramaric\u2019s opener and then via a penalty by Sergio Ramos.\n\nLuis Enrique\u2019s lineup was pressing for a late goal when Croatia produced one last push that paid off with Jedvaj\u2019s second score.\n\n\u201cCroatia got that little bit of fortune when both teams were desperately trying to win this match right at the end,\u201d Luis Enrique said.\n\nROONEY BIDS FAREWELL\n\nMaking his 120th and last appearance for England, the 33-year-old Rooney was denied a perfect farewell by Brad Guzan when the U.S. goalkeeper dived to stop his shot in stoppage time.\n\nRecalled after two years out of the England squad, the D.C. United forward sparked the biggest cheers of the night when he went on as a 58th-minute substitute against the country he now calls home.\n\nEngland\u2019s goals came from Jesse Lingard, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Callum Wilson.\n\nBELGIANS ON COURSE\n\nMichy Batshuayi, replacing the injured Romelu Lukaku in attack, scored twice as Belgium beat Iceland for a third victory in the Nations League.\n\nA draw against Switzerland on Sunday would be enough for Belgium to reach the finals. It has nine points from three games in Group 2 of League A, three ahead of Switzerland. Iceland had already been relegated to League B before the match.\n\nFrance and Portugal are also favored to reach the finals from their groups in League A.\n\nOTHER GAMES\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina will join the top 12 teams on the continent for the next Nations League after it won Group 3 of League B. The Balkan nation got the point it needed by drawing 0-0 at Austria and remaining undefeated. The result also relegated Northern Ireland.\n\nFinland won Group 2 of League C with one match remaining despite losing 1-0 against Greece. Estonia was relegated from the same group after losing 2-0 at Hungary.\n\nIn League D, already-promoted Georgia drew 1-1 at Andorra, Latvia drew 1-1 at Kazakhstan, Belarus won 2-0 at Luxembourg and Moldova won 1-0 at San Marino.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But the battle against Beijing\u2019s economic espionage is still accelerating, and it may prove more important over time in leveling the playing field between the two countries.\n\nTo combat Chinese spying and hacking, U.S. intelligence agencies are increasingly sharing with the Justice Department revelatory information about Chinese operations. That has led to a string of recent indictments and, in one case, the arrest abroad of an alleged Chinese spy and his extradition to the United States to face trial.\n\nThe indictments don\u2019t just charge violations of law; they also expose details of Chinese spycraft. And there\u2019s a hidden threat: The Chinese must consider whether the United States has blown the covers of not just the people and organizations named in the criminal charges but also others with whom they came in contact.\n\nThis law enforcement approach to counterespionage requires public disclosure of sensitive information, something that intelligence agencies often resist. But it seems to be an emerging U.S. strategy. The Justice Department has pursued a similar open assault on Russian cyberespionage, with three recent indictments naming a score of Russian operatives and disclosing their hacking techniques, malware tools and planned targets.\n\nChina, like Russia, is displaying an increasingly freewheeling and entrepreneurial approach to espionage. Several indictments unsealed since September reveal how the Ministry of State Security, the Chinese spy service, has operated through its regional bureaus \u2014 in this case the Jiangsu provincial office of the MSS \u2014 to obtain precious U.S. technology.\n\nThe indictments allege that from 2010 to 2015, the Jiangsu branch ran a team of nine hackers who tried to steal U.S. techniques for making jet engines. This is a subtle and highly valuable aspect of aerospace technology, one of the few that China hasn\u2019t yet mastered or stolen, and the Chinese evidently wanted to obtain by stealth what they couldn\u2019t produce on their own.\n\n\u201cThe concerted effort to steal, rather than simply purchase, commercially available products should offend every company that invests talent, energy and shareholder money into the development of products,\u201d said Adam Braverman, the U.S. attorney in San Diego who helped prosecute the cases.\n\nThe San Diego indictment lists the hacker names used by the alleged conspirators, handles such as \u201cCobain,\u201d \u201csxpdlcl\u201d and \u201cmer4en7y.\u201d A separate indictment charged an MSS officer named Yanjun Xu, a deputy division director in the Jiangsu bureau, with trying to steal jet engine secrets from GE Aviation; Xu was arrested in April in Belgium after he began trying to penetrate the company\u2019s operations, and he was extradited to the United States last month. The United States in September arrested a U.S. Army reservist named Ji Chaoqun and charged that he had helped the Chinese gain information about aerospace industry targets.\n\nThis month, the Justice Department also unsealed a September indictment that accused a Chinese company and its Taiwanese partner, both funded by the Chinese government, of trying to steal eight trade secrets for a memory-chip technology known as DRAM from Micron Technology Inc., based in Silicon Valley. The indictment notes that the Chinese government had identified DRAM as \u201ca national economic priority\u201d that Beijing was determined to obtain.\n\nThe indictment, brought by the U.S. attorney in San Jose, uses blunt language to describe the alleged plot: \u201cIn order to develop DRAM technology and production capabilities without investing years of research and development and the expenditure of many millions of dollars,\u201d the defendants \u201cconspired to circumvent Micron\u2019s restrictions on its proprietary technology.\u201d\n\nWhat gives these indictments extra bite is that President Xi Jinping had promised back in 2015 that China wouldn\u2019t conduct economic cyberespionage anymore. That pledge followed an indictment the previous year that revealed an elaborate plot by Chinese military hackers to steal U.S. commercial secrets.\n\nBut in the espionage world, promises not to spy are dubious at best. Over the past three years, the Justice Department has charged former CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee and five other Americans with stealing secrets on behalf of Beijing.\n\nAs a rising power, China is also a rising threat in the intelligence sphere. The U.S. counterattack, in part, seems to be a public revelation of just how and why Beijing is stealing America\u2019s secrets \u2014 overt payback for covert espionage.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Karoun Demirjian", "title": "With sanctions and banned arms sales, bipartisan Senate group tries to bring an end to Yemen war", "description": "The proposal, backed by Trump ally Sen.

According to reports, Yemeni pro-government forces backed by the Saudi-led coalition have suspended their offensive on the Houthi-controlled port city of Hodeidah amid international calls to return to dialogue with the Houthi rebels. (Stringer/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nA bipartisan group of senators is releasing legislation imposing sanctions, prohibitions and restrictions against Saudi Arabia and other entities considered responsible for the humanitarian suffering in war-torn Yemen, the most punitive proposals to emerge from Congress since Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered last month.\n\nThe group, which is led by Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) and includes Trump confidant Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), is calling for a total prohibition on arms sales to Saudi Arabia that could be used for offensive purposes. The blanket embargo includes a ban on selling Riyadh munitions, bombs, missiles, aircraft, tanks or armored vehicles, according to a person familiar with the text, but does not prevent the sale of purely defensive systems, such as missile interceptors.\n\nThe measure would also codify the Trump administration\u2019s recent decision to stop refueling Saudi planes engaged in operations in Yemen against the Houthi rebels and impose sanctions on anyone supporting the Houthi rebellion \u2014 namely, Iran \u2014 within 30 days of the bill\u2019s passage. Those who prevent the delivery of humanitarian aid to Yemeni civilians would also be subject to new proposed sanctions in the bill that would go into effect immediately.\n\n\u201cThis bill makes clear that Congress demands an immediate cessation of hostilities, urgently calls on all parties to prioritize protection of Yemeni civilians, and makes certain that only a political settlement will end this war,\u201d Menendez said in a statement. \u201cWe are putting teeth behind these demands with regular oversight, sanctions, and suspension of weapons sales and refueling support.\u201d\n\nThe bill came together in response to mounting outrage among lawmakers of both parties over Saudi Arabia\u2019s conduct, particularly in the murder of Khashoggi at its consulate in Istanbul. Many lawmakers believe that operation could not have taken place without the blessing of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \u2014 whom, thus far, the Trump administration has not sanctioned.\n\nCongress\u2019s first response to Khashoggi\u2019s murder was invoking the Global Magnitsky Act \u2014 a law that requires Trump to decide within 120 days what individuals are responsible for human rights abuses and what sanctions should be imposed against them. On Thursday, the Trump administration announced it would sanction 17 individuals under that authority, just hours before the bipartisan group of senators released their proposal.\n\nBut for many, President Trump\u2019s move fell short. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) ridiculed \u201cputting sanctions on people who are in prison\u201d as a weak choice, while drafters of the new bill suspected that Trump was trying to draw attention away from their more comprehensive proposals.\n\n\u201cIt looks like some shameless coordination with a government that has trampled on the rule of law,\u201d said a Senate aide familiar with the bill. \u201cIt would defy credulity that the announcement came out today when they know what we\u2019re doing here in the Senate . . . they\u2019re willing to designate individuals in the inner circles of Mohammed bin Salman and they won\u2019t say a damn thing about the crown prince himself.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the provisions of the new bill are designed to force Trump to take a harder stance against the Saudi kingdom, which he all but fully embraced upon becoming president while distancing himself from Iran.\n\nThe bill would make sanctions mandatory for anyone found to have responsibility in Khashoggi\u2019s murder under the Global Magnitsky Act. It would also require the administration to produce two reports on Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe first of those reports would address the question of where the activities of the Saudi-led coalition, Houthi rebels and others have risen to the level of war crimes, or otherwise violated international humanitarian law and the laws of war. Another would be focused on documenting Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights abuses, focusing on the government\u2019s suppression of women, bloggers and religious freedom.\n\nThe product of those reports, the Senate aide said, could be easily compared to existing international studies to see if the Trump administration\u2019s assessment of the situation in the Persian Gulf is notably kinder to Saudi leaders.\n\nFor Democrats, the bill\u2019s provisions address deep skepticism that the Trump administration will hold individuals at the highest levels of the Saudi government accountable, either for the human cost of its actions in Yemen or the murder of Khashoggi.\n\nRepublican supporters are trying to strike a more coaxing tone, encouraging the Trump administration to take advantage of the tools in the bill.\n\n\u201cThis legislation provides the Trump administration leverage it should use to push all parties in Yemen to engage in good faith and urgent negotiations to end the civil war and address the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis,\u201d Young said in a statement. \u201cOur national security interests and our humanitarian principles demand nothing less.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur bill sends an important signal, and when combined with the efforts announced by the Treasury Department, goes a long way to address despicable behavior on several fronts,\u201d Graham said.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee ranking member Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who sits on both the Armed Services and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, are also original co-sponsors of the legislation.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}]
