Of death.\u201d\n\n[Gunman kills three, including a police officer, in shooting at Chicago hospital]\n\nThe calls to action come after the NRA told doctors to \u201cstay in their lane\u201d earlier this month, suggesting that gun policy is the NRA\u2019s domain. It sparked a backlash from medical professionals across the United States and abroad, voicing their disdain on social media with the hashtag #ThisIsOurLane.\n\nThe Chicago shooting further fueled the flames, prompting medical professionals to voice their opinions.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Frances Stead Sellers reported:\n\nThe NRA tweet was spurred by a position paper from the American College of Physicians posted on Oct. 30 by the Annals of Internal Medicine and titled \u201cReducing Firearm Injuries and Deaths in the United States.\u201d The ACP recommended \u201ca public health approach to firearms-related violence and the prevention of firearm injuries and deaths,\u201d saying the medical profession has a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to speak out on the prevention of such injuries and supporting \u201cappropriate regulation of the purchase of legal firearms,\u201d among other measures. \u201cThe College acknowledges that any such regulations must be consistent with the Supreme Court ruling establishing that individual ownership of firearms is a constitutional right under the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights,\u201d the paper said. The NRA lashed out, first with a Nov. 2 editorial saying that the ACP paper \u201creflects every anti-gunner\u2019s public policy wish list, save for the outsized role given to doctors,\u201d and accusing the group of being \u201conly interested in pseudo\u00adscience \u2018evidence\u2019 that supports their preferred anti-gun policies.\u201d Then on Nov. 7, just hours before 28-year-old former Marine Ian David Long launched his attack at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, the NRA put out its provocative tweet. \u201cSomeone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane. Half of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control. Most upsetting, however, the medical community seems to have consulted NO ONE but themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Annals of Internal Medicine responded in kind.\n\nIn an editorial published Tuesday in the prominent academic medical journal, physicians said that the NRA \u201cdoes not believe firearm-related injury and its prevention is within the purview of physicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could not disagree more,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cIf you are unconvinced and need examples of why firearms are a health issue, here are a few. People with accidental gun-related injury nearly always require acute medical care, and many go on to have chronic injury-related health issues. Almost 40 percent of individuals who commit suicide are seen by their primary care provider within the preceding month. Firearms are a frequent and very effective means of suicide. Thus, talking with patients at risk for suicide about their access to firearms is clearly \u2018in our lane.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe editorial also stated that physicians and nurses are responsible for performing surgeries to try to save the lives of victims in such situations, and informing the families when they still die.\n\n\u201cThese responsibilities are not only in doctors' lane, they are our job,\u201d the physicians wrote. \u201cConsequently, so is advocating for policies that reduce firearm injury and conducting research to better inform policies to keep our patients safer.\u201d\n\nThe NRA did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post.\n\n\n\nA nurse exits Mercy Hospital after a man shot three people on Monday in Chicago.

An American flag stood nearby, and a crystal chandelier dangled above. Behind him, servers arranged the tables for a Thanksgiving feast.\n\nBeneath a gold ceiling, Trump told troops representing five branches in five countries overseas about \u201cbarbed wire plus . . . the ultimate\u201d that was blocking migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Loquacious and hopping from topic to topic, he debated the merits of steam catapults vs. electromagnetic ones for aircraft carriers and whether the United States was being treated poorly on trade. On both occasions, perplexed officers on the other end of the phone seemed to disagree with his conclusions.\n\nHe blamed \u201cthe world\u201d for the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, disputing the analysis from the CIA that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was to blame. In fact, Trump said inexplicably, the crown prince hated the death even more than Trump did.\n\nExplaining why he needed to keep a close alliance with Saudi Arabia, he cited lower oil prices. That leads to lower gas prices, he said, before saying the news media had unfairly blamed him for traffic jams caused by cheap gas.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has stumbled when it came to demonstrating his support for the military \u2014 skipping a military cemetery memorial service outside Paris, declining to visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and mocking a Navy SEAL who led the raid to capture Osama bin Laden, saying bin Laden should have been found far earlier.\n\nAsked Thursday whether it was enough to call troops from his palatial resort and later visit officers at a nearby station, he retreated to a familiar boast.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s done more for the military than me,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSometimes, he praised those on the other end of the line, but often by extension he praised himself.\n\n\u201cA as in the best,\u201d he said of one Coast Guard officer\u2019s school, likening it to his alma mater. \u201cGoing to that school is like going to the Wharton School of Finance if you happen to be doing what you do.\u201d\n\nA Navy commander in Bahrain, a U.S. ally, became the foil to discuss trade.\n\n\u201cAs you know, trade for me is a very big subject,\u201d Trump said, adding that the United States was getting ripped off.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any good trade deals,\u201d Trump complained.\n\nThe commander seemed confused and told the president of abundant goods being carried across nearby waters. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any issues in terms of trade right now,\u201d the officer said.\n\nTrump quickly moved on to hurricane response, bragging several times about the improving brand of the Coast Guard.\n\n\u201cWaves like record-setting. It\u2019s been record-setting. The one hurricane in Texas they say dumped more water, and it was more violent in terms of water, than anything we\u2019ve ever had in the country,\u201d he said, referring to rescues they had undertaken.\n\nHe complained at length that a new Navy ship was using electromagnetic catapults to propel planes off ships. He said steam was better and was incredulous the military would consider otherwise. \u201cWould you go with steam or would you go with electromagnetic? Because steam is very reliable, and the electromagnetic, unfortunately, you have to be Albert Einstein to really work it properly,\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYou have to be Albert Einstein to run the nuclear power plants that we have here, as well. But we\u2019re doing that very well. I would go, sir, with electromagnetic,\u201d the officer responded.\n\nTrump repeatedly asked military commanders what they were seeing in their regions, a conversation not usually held on a televised broadcast. He asked if those serving in Afghanistan were enjoying themselves. (Later, he demurred when asked by reporters whether he would pull troops out of the country.)\n\nHe bragged during part of the conversation about sending troops to the Mexico border, a mission that is controversial and seen by many as a waste of time. He expressed no second-guessing about the constitutionality of signing an order giving soldiers the right to use lethal force at the border, although many in his government harbor such concerns.\n\nAs he spoke, a soccer net was being set up on the large front lawn, and his daughter Ivanka Trump and her children were spotted in leisurewear near the mangrove bushes.\n\nThe subsequent 55-minute question-and-answer session with reporters had a similar antic air. He claimed to know little about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange or the Justice Department\u2019s desire to prosecute him. (In the past, Trump has said, \u201cI love WikiLeaks!\u201d)\n\nFalsely, the president said the gross domestic product percentage was \u201cgoing down to minus 4, 5, 6 percent\u201d when he took office, describing the country as \u201cteetering\u201d under President Barack Obama. (It was a positive 2.1 percent in the last quarter of 2016.)\n\nHe offered, without evidence, that Clinton had \u201cprobably\u201d deleted more than 100,000 emails, a continuation of his long campaign to impugn her for using a private email system. At the same time, he defended Ivanka Trump\u2019s use of a private email account for government business as \u201cvery innocent.\u201d He said Ivanka\u2019s private emails were all \u201cin the Historical Society\u201d; her lawyer has said they were forwarded to an official government server.\n\nHe disclosed that he was interviewing job candidates at Mar-a-Lago, although no jobs are known to be open. He has let his frustration with several Cabinet officials be known, and the president said Thursday that embattled Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was \u201cin there trying.\u201d And he offered effusive, unprompted praise for Hope Hicks, a former top aide.\n\nBy 11:15 a.m., he had arrived at a nearby Coast Guard station, where he greeted troops and posed for pictures for 14 minutes in a sweltering kitchen, in front of a tray of submarine sandwiches the troops would soon eat for lunch. He served no turkey but told Coast Guard officials there that he would give them $100 if they could break par at his golf course.\n\nBy noon, Trump disappeared behind the towering hedges of that course. Thursday night, he was enjoying a spread in the gilded Mar-a-Lago ballroom. The menu included turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, ribs, Chilean sea bass, Florida stone crab, beef tenderloin and Caesar salad, among other dishes. Surrounded by family, he pointed at the cameras and waved while other club\u00adgoers angled to get in the camera shot."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eugenerobinson.columnist", "title": "Trump is not a champion of human rights.

They see a preening, clueless clown.\n\nTrump\u2019s reaction \u2014 or non-reaction \u2014 to the Saudi regime\u2019s brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is a holiday-season gift to autocrats around the globe. It shows them that if you just shower Trump with over-the-top flattery, feed him some geopolitical mumbo jumbo and make vague promises to perhaps buy some American-made goods in the future, he will literally let you get away with murder.\n\nRecall what happened: The Saudi government lured Khashoggi, a contributing columnist for The Post, to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, where a team of assassins lay in wait. Khashoggi was killed and his body dismembered. The CIA has reportedly concluded with \u201chigh confidence\u201d \u2014 as close to certainty as the agency gets \u2014 that the assassination was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the nation\u2019s de facto ruler.\n\nAfter weeks of hemming and hawing, the White House put out a statement Tuesday from Trump making clear that for the murder of Khashoggi \u2014 who lived in Virginia, was a permanent U.S. resident and had children who are U.S. citizens \u2014 the Saudi regime will face no consequences. Zero. Not even a slap on the wrist.\n\nDespite the CIA\u2019s assessment that the crown prince ordered the killing, the White House statement waffles on whether he even knew about it in advance: \u201cMaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d Trump said the same thing later to reporters, adding, \u201cWe are with Saudi Arabia. We\u2019re staying with Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\n[The Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 means Americans lose]\n\nEven more appalling, the statement \u2014 which is littered with exclamation points, suggesting Trump himself had a hand in writing it \u2014 attacks and defames the victim. Khashoggi was a respected journalist who sometimes criticized the Saudi government. The president of the United States suggests he deserved to die.\n\n\u201cRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u2018enemy of the state\u2019 and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that,\u201d the statement says. That is a rhetorical device known as paraleipsis \u2014 saying something by professing not to say it \u2014 and its use to suggest the Saudis were somehow justified in killing Khashoggi makes me want to throw up.\n\nIn the statement \u2014 which is headlined \u201cAmerica First!\u201d \u2014 Trump emphasizes what he calls the \u201crecord amount of money\u201d that Saudi Arabia is supposedly prepared to spend in the United States. Trump goes on to make a series of false claims. No, there is no agreement for the Saudis to spend $450 billion on U.S. goods, despite Trump\u2019s assertion. No, there is no firm agreement for $110 billion in arms sales; the actual figure is $14.5 billion. No, what Trump reckons as \u201chundreds of thousands of jobs\u201d are not at stake. And no, the Saudis could not simply decide to buy Chinese or Russian arms, instead.\n\nThe truth is that in the U.S.-Saudi relationship, the United States holds all the cards. We don\u2019t need the Saudis\u2019 oil and can easily do without their arms purchases. By contrast, without U.S. military assistance and American-made spare parts, the Saudi armed forces could not function.\n\nBut leave aside Trump\u2019s inability to calculate the power equation here \u2014 perhaps he should read \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d \u2014 and consider the factors that are absent from his thinking. There is no mention in his statement of human rights, no mention of freedom of the press. There is no notion of the United States as an advocate for liberty or a foe of despotism. There is only the amoral pursuit of what Trump sees \u2014 not very clearly \u2014 as U.S. national interests.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump holds a chart highlighting arms sales to Saudi Arabia during a White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, left, in March. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe Saudi royals got on Trump\u2019s good side by hosting his first foreign visit and fawning over him as if he, too, were an absolute monarch. North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un was gracious and deferential to Trump at their summit \u2014 and now continues his nuclear and ballistic missile programs unmolested. Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin complimented Trump\u2019s political skill \u2014 and escaped any meaningful punishment for meddling in the 2016 election. There cannot be a strongman ruler in the world who fails to see the pattern \u2014 and the opportunity.\n\nLavish Trump with praise. Treat him like a king. Wave a fistful of money in front of his face.

But more than a year after he began threatening tariffs against major trading partners, he has relatively little to show for it. The improvements in the North American Free Trade Agreement are modest at best. The U.S. economy hasn\u2019t suffered significantly, but global growth is beginning to slow, and trade jitters are one reason.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund warned last month that it was lowering its global growth projections by 0.2 percentage points for 2018 and 2019, in part because of \u201crising trade barriers.\u201d The IMF explained: \u201cEscalating trade tensions and the potential shift away from a multilateral, rules-based trading system are key threats to the global outlook. . . . An increase in trade barriers would disrupt global supply chains . . . and slow the spread of new technologies, ultimately lowering global productivity and welfare.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s trade strategy has been a gradual march toward the cliff, as summarized in a timeline prepared by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. First came the Oct. 31, 2017, recommendations for tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, which were imposed in January on about $10 billion in imports of these products \u2014 the first such tariff requests since 2001 and a small but telling warning shot.\n\nThe big guns were rolled out by the Commerce Department in its February recommendation for tariffs on steel and aluminum under the rarely used \u201cnational security\u201d authority of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The tariffs were steep \u2014 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum \u2014 and they heavily targeted allies. Some trading partners got exemptions, but the tariffs were reimposed on countries the president wanted to squeeze, such as Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrump evidently imagined that Section 232 tariffs would force Mexico and Canada to capitulate in revising NAFTA. That didn\u2019t happen. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a modest improvement, with some better protections for workers. But one negotiator estimated that 85 percent of the improvements in the deal were lifted from the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 which Trump scuttled when he first took office.\n\nThe downside of Trump\u2019s trade isolationism is illustrated by the fact that the TPP is going ahead without the United States. Seven countries have already endorsed the pact, and that number is likely to grow to 11 by the end of December, when the TPP takes effect. The agreement will cut tariffs on agricultural and industrial products, ease foreign investment and protect intellectual property \u2014 all potential benefits for the United States that will be lost.\n\nThe main adversary in the trade war, of course, has been China. In July, Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion in products, and then in September added $200 billion after threatening tariffs on all Chinese products. What the administration hadn\u2019t considered carefully enough was the blowback of these tariffs felt by U.S. manufacturers that use Chinese products. A similar misunderstanding about global supply chains undermined the campaigns against Mexico and Canada. To be blunt, this is a trade-focused administration that doesn\u2019t seem to understand how global trade really works.\n\n\u201cThis is not a normal negotiation with normal people,\u201d commented a Canadian business leader who has watched Trump\u2019s negotiators try to bully concessions from Canada, with limited success.\n\nU.S. businesses that are getting caught in the trade backfire are protesting more loudly. This week, nearly 40 organizations representing retailers, manufacturers and farmers sent U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer a letter demanding removal of the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum still imposed against Mexico and Canada. The industry groups warned that they want to support a new USMCA pact, but only if it \u201cbenefits . . . our long-term ability to survive in a global economy.\u201d\n\nA potential showdown will come when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet in Buenos Aires during the G-20 talks, which begin Nov. 30. Trump has pressured China with his usual threats and economic penalties. Now, if the North Korea nuclear negotiations and NAFTA are any guide, he will move toward a deal that makes limited changes to the status quo, but one that he can tout as a victory.\n\nNearly two years on, Trump\u2019s trade policies seem like a very big windup for a puny pitch. He could hold out for more \u2014 and go to full battle stations in the trade conflict \u2014 but that would be a mistake and especially harmful for Trump supporters in manufacturing.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Colombia: Over 40 Venezuelan women rescued from sex ring", "description": "Authorities in Colombia say they've rescued more than 40 Venezuelan women from a \"21st century sex slavery\" ring in which migrants were held captive and forced into prostitution", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/colombia-over-40-venezuelan-women-rescued-from-sex-ring/2018/11/22/16385c1e-eea4-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T22:15:15Z", "content": "BOGOTA, Colombia Authorities in Colombia said Thursday they have rescued more than 40 Venezuelan women from a 21st century sex slavery ring in which migrants were held captive and forced into prostitution.

Matthew White's biological father is his mother\u2019s fertility doctor, Donald Cline. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nJacoba Ballard was conceived in a brick office building on 86th Street in Indianapolis when fertility doctor Donald Cline inseminated her mother with his own sperm instead of the donor sperm he had promised.\n\nTo Ballard, it was an offense akin to rape \u2014 one Cline is suspected of repeating with as many as 50 other women. But the law in Indiana, as in most other states, was not written to account for such a crime. So Cline was charged with obstruction of justice, and accused of false advertising and \u201cimmoral conduct\u201d in the delivery of services. He lost his medical license, was fined $500 and received a year\u2019s probation.\n\n\u201cMy mother was violated. He took advantage of her in one of the most vulnerable moments of her life,\u201d Ballard said. The sentence, she said, was \u201cnot enough to send a message.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mother was violated,\u201d said Jacoba Ballard, whose biological father is Cline. (April Kolb)\n\nNow Ballard, 38, is part of a growing movement pushing for stronger safeguards on assisted reproduction and tougher penalties when things go wrong. Led by donor-conceived people who have discovered that their very existence was marred by fraud or mistakes, this movement is raising tough questions about the responsibility of the fertility industry that the legal system is ill-equipped to answer.\n\nIn Ottawa, for example, donor offspring are lobbying for a ban on anonymous sales of reproductive material following revelations that a fertility doctor there used his sperm to impregnate 11 women. In Utah, the state legislature has expanded the definition of incest to include a person who knowingly provides sperm or a human egg to a related person for in vitro fertilization.\n\nAnd in Indiana, Ballard and other people sired by Cline are lobbying state legislators to create a new category of crime known as fertility fraud that would punish the intentional misuse of reproductive material with up to 2\u00bd years in prison.\n\nSean Tipton, chief policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said errors and fraud in the industry are rare, and are easily addressed under existing laws. Clinics maintain rigorous safety protocols to ensure that the correct genetic material is transferred, that donors are properly screened and that medical workers adhere to stringent ethical standards, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terribly obvious that for a physician to substitute his own sperm for donor sperm is an awful thing,\u201d Tipton said. \u201cBut it seems to me that there are existing legal remedies.\u201d\n\nStill, many families who have borne children through assisted reproduction \u2014 especially using donor sperm or eggs \u2014 have struggled to recover from serious lapses, including embryos switched before birth, babies sired by the \u201cwrong\u201d father, and children who inherit serious, undisclosed medical issues.\n\nJustice is difficult to find, or even define, in such situations. Prosecutors and the courts have been reluctant to weigh in, especially when a child is healthy. Taking sides, in their view, could label a child \u201cdamaged\u201d and make an implicit judgment about the relative worth of one life over another.\n\nMany of the children, meanwhile, are left grappling with a lifetime of trauma, knowing their existence is not what their parents intended.\n\n\u201cThese are horrible, horrible cases, and unfortunately the law really hasn\u2019t caught up with the enormity of the problem,\u201d said Ron Norman, an attorney hired by a family in Santa Barbara, Calif., whose daughter, Brittany, was described in one news report as \u201cthe poster child for sperm gone wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhite, left, helps Molly, 7, and Logan, 4, with homework, along with the children\u2019s grandmother, Liz White.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nIllness raises questions\n\nBrittany Johnson was 6 in 1995 when her parents first discovered blood in her urine. After consulting multiple specialists, they discovered she had autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease , which causes cysts to develop in the kidneys.\n\nThe condition is hereditary and serious, typically causing abdominal pain, high blood pressure and, eventually, kidney failure. Many patients require a transplant. After Brittany\u2019s mother tested negative for the gene that causes disease, doctors pointed to the sperm donor.\n\nThe donor, No. 276, had been advertised as healthy. But at some point after Johnson was born, her parents inquired about buying additional sperm to conceive a sibling for her. The sperm bank, California Cryobank, said it had stopped selling the donor\u2019s sperm after learning his aunt had kidney issues.\n\nAs the girl\u2019s condition worsened, her parents sued the sperm bank in 1995 for more information, making her case one of the first to be fought in the public spotlight. The case ultimately settled out of court, with the donor agreeing to a deposition.\n\nJohnson said they learned that several of the donor\u2019s relatives had kidney disease, but he refused to answer more detailed questions about his health.\n\nCalifornia Cryobank did not admit fault, and a spokesman declined to comment on the case, citing terms of the agreement with Johnson\u2019s family. The spokesman said the sperm bank maintains a rigorous screening process that includes expanded genetic testing, formal assessments by a psychologist, and criminal background checks.\n\nToday, Johnson is 29, and her health is stable. But she worries what will happen years from now, when many people with her condition typically get sicker. Looking back on her childhood, she is angry about all that her family endured.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I knew my body, and I didn\u2019t feel like there were a lot of places to go for answers,\u201d she said.\n\nShe hates it when people tell her she should be grateful just to be alive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t here, my parents would have a happy, healthy child.\u201d\n\n\n\nMolly and Logan White play at home in Carmel, Ind. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\n'Stolen sperm'\n\nSarah Lin was older, 41, when she learned of her origins. On a whim, the stay-at-home mother from Washington state sent her saliva off to Ancestry.com to get her DNA analyzed. Her parents had told her when she turned 25 that she had been conceived with donor sperm. Back then, she hadn\u2019t given it much thought. But as the years passed and she had two children of her own, she become curious about her origins.\n\nHer dad had been a colonel in the U.S. Army stationed at Fort Knox in Kentucky when her parents sought help for infertility at a local clinic. Their doctor recommended donor sperm, and told them he had found a donor who was similar in looks and personality to her father. The only other piece of information offered was that the donor could trace his roots back to the founding families of Virginia. Lin\u2019s parents were thrilled, and she was born nine months later.\n\nAfter Lin got her DNA results in the summer of 2017, she began working with friends online to find her biological father. After some sleuthing, they located the likely donor.\n\nWhen Lin emailed him, the man replied that he had never donated sperm. However, he and his wife had visited the same fertility clinic the summer Lin was conceived. Lin and the man soon connected over the phone, and they came to the stunning conclusion that the sperm samples the man had produced to create his own family had probably also been given to Lin\u2019s parents.\n\n\u201cHe was in a bit of shock. Very open, very curious about me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut he also felt very violated.\u201d\n\nNeither Lin nor the donor has pursued legal action. A spokeswoman for the fertility clinic declined to comment on the case, saying there are \u201cno records available for clinical care that far back.\u201d\n\nLin was left with mixed feelings. Though she was excited to find her biological father, she is angry about the circumstances. The two have not spoken since.\n\n\u201cI would have never chosen to be conceived from any stolen sperm,\u201d Lin said. \u201cI am grateful for my life, but it is horrible what happened to him.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbigail and Matthew White play with their children.

Because of a lab mix-up, she was conceived with sperm from Midwest Sperm Bank Donor No. 330, who is African American, instead of Donor No. 380, who is white.\n\nHer story came to light in 2014, when her mother, Jennifer Cramblett, and her partner, Amanda Zinkon, sued the sperm bank under Ohio\u2019s \u201cwrongful birth\u201d statute, arguing that while they loved their daughter dearly, they were ill-equipped to raise a biracial child.\n\nThe \u201cwrongful birth\u201d law typically applies when a medical provider fails to provide adequate information or counseling about the risks of having a child with a serious illness. In her lawsuit, Cramblett \u2014 who grew up in an all-white environment \u2014 described \u201cnumerous challenges and external pressures associated with an unplanned transracial parent-child relationship.\u201d\n\nThe case drew emotional commentary about designer babies, prejudice in America, and the randomness of motherhood.\n\n\u201cHaving a baby isn\u2019t like ordering a pair of jeans \u2014 you can\u2019t return it if it isn\u2019t to your liking. Anyone who thinks they are entitled to exactly the child they envisioned \u2014 and are prepared to fly to court if they don\u2019t get it \u2014 isn\u2019t fit to be a parent,\u201d Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby fumed.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s Julie Bindel was more sympathetic: \u201cI know white people who have adopted black children. . . . At least one of these couples, when told a black child would be placed with them, quite seriously considered whether they would be doing right by the child.\u201d\n\nAfter the Illinois sperm bank apologized and issued a partial refund, Cramblett\u2019s lawsuit was thrown out by a DuPage County judge in 2016. The Illinois Appellate Court upheld that decision in June 2017.\n\nMidwest Sperm Bank declined to comment on the case. The company sent Cramblett a refund check for the six vials of sperm she had purchased and a letter of apology in 2011, while Cramblett was still pregnant with Payton.\n\nNow 6, Payton is by all accounts adored by her family. She plays softball and has become a familiar face in the small, mostly white town where her mother grew up and her grandmother still lives. She is unaware of the controversy, and her family hopes to shield her from it for as long as possible.\n\nCramblett said she is disheartened that stories about the case have focused on race rather than the fertility industry\u2019s failures.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was accountability,\u201d she said. \u201cThey made a mistake and refused to acknowledge their mistake.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhite plays with Logan at home. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nScandals around the world\n\nThe prosecution of Cline, the Indiana fertility doctor, is one in a string of recent scandals involving doctors using their own sperm to father children with their patients.\n\nIn Idaho Falls, Gerald Mortimer, an OB/GYN, appeared in court in August to answer charges of medical negligence, fraud, battery, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress for allegedly using his own sperm to impregnate a patient.\n\nIn Ottawa, 11 patients who claim their DNA tests show their children are related to Norman Barwin, their fertility doctor, filed a class-action claim against him in April.\n\nAnd in Rotterdam, last year, 12 men and women who were conceived with sperm from a fertility center alleged that its director is their father.\n\nBallard, an emergency medical worker, first came to suspect Cline was her biological father in 2015 after she took a mail-away test and found that some of his relatives were her relatives too. She took her concerns to a few half-siblings she had met online.\n\n\u201cWe knew something wasn\u2019t right. We all started talking, and all of our parents had been told the same thing: \u2018I\u2019m going to use a medical resident,\u2019 \u201d she recalled.\n\nCline\u2019s attorney declined to comment on the case.\n\n\n\nDonald Cline is suspected of inseminating dozens of women with his sperm. He lost his medical license, was fined $500 and received a year\u2019s probation. (Marion County (Ind.)/AP)\n\nThe group confronted him one day at a restaurant in downtown Indianapolis. She remembers him wearing a gun under his sweater and carrying a piece of paper with a Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5. \u201cBefore I formed you in the womb, I knew you,\u201d he read to them. \u201cBefore you were born I set you apart.\u201d\n\nBallard, who is Catholic, cut him off. \u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t use my God to justify your actions.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of tears shed. But not because of meeting him,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of our situation.\u201d\n\nAlong with several half-siblings, Ballard has since filed complaints with the Marion County prosecutor and the Indiana attorney general. She has found roughly 50 people born between 1974 and 1987 who believe Cline is their father.\n\nAmong them is Matthew White, 35, an environmental consultant who learned he was donor-conceived when he was 15. Growing up, he said, he and his mother would often pass the building where Cline\u2019s clinic was located, and she would tell him how happy she was the day she found out she was pregnant with him.\n\nBecause his family, which includes both a mother and father, always felt complete, White said he never sought out information about his donor. But then, while browsing the Internet in 2016, he spotted a news story about Cline and noticed that an accompanying picture of the doctor looked strikingly like him.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018What is going on? This can\u2019t be true,\u2019 \u201d he recalled, adding that the discovery left his happy childhood memories marred by a \u201cblack scar\u201d of deception.\n\nTogether, Ballard, White and other half-siblings lobbied members of the Indiana state Senate to introduce the fertility fraud bill. The measure died in committee earlier this year, but the group is pressing legislators to introduce it again when the legislature convenes in January.\n\nCline \u201cknew what he was doing,\u201d White said. \u201cIt was calculated, and he got away with it.

He inserted his family lineage into the patient without their consent,\u201d Madeira said.\n\n\u201cThe law is not set up to handle claims like this.

(Ashlee Rezin/Chicago Sun-Times/AP)\n\nThe explosive report about sexual abuse by Catholic priests unveiled by a Pennsylvania grand jury in August has set off an unprecedented wave of investigations over the last several months, with attorneys general in 14 states and the District of Columbia announcing probes and demanding documents from Catholic officials. Those efforts have been joined by a federal investigation out of Philadelphia that may become national in scope.\n\nThe swift and sweeping response by civil authorities contrasts sharply with the Vatican\u2019s comparatively glacial pace. While some U.S. dioceses have published lists of priests they say have been credibly accused of sexual abuse and two cardinals have been ousted, the Vatican this month put on hold a vote by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on measures to hold bishops more accountable until after a global synod in early 2019. In the meantime, Rome has done little to address the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Catholic Church has proven that it cannot police itself,\u201d said Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan (D), whose state is among those investigating. \u201cAnd civil authorities can\u2019t let the church hide child sexual abuse allegations as personnel matters. They\u2019re crimes. We need a full accounting of the church.\u201d\n\nThe new investigations are taking place in a very different climate than existed in 2002, when the Boston Globe exposed decades of abuse and coverups in that city. Many lay Catholics have lost faith in the church\u2019s ability to right itself and are pushing for civil authorities to hold high-ranking church officials accountable. There\u2019s also a greater willingness by law enforcement to do battle with a church that has become a far less formidable local presence. And the graphic grand jury report has spurred widespread public outrage.\n\nHowever, hope for action won\u2019t be satisfied quickly. Following an initial flurry of news conferences and calls to hotlines set up for the public to report abuse, there is likely to be an extended period of silence while prosecutors gather evidence.\n\nState and federal prosecutors have three tools at their disposal: criminal charges against allegedly guilty priests or even the bishops believed to have abetted their abuse, civil suits against individuals or larger church entities, and public reports that expose the names and deeds of accused abusers without formal action.\n\nAs authorities launch their investigations, often involving episodes that are decades old, they make no promises about where their probes will ultimately lead.\n\n\u201cWill they get many prosecutions out of it? Probably not,\u201d said Marci Hamilton, executive director of Child USA, a think tank dedicated to stopping child abuse. \u201cIn most circumstances, the statute of limitations has expired, or the evidence is circumstantial.\u201d\n\nShe noted, however, that the attorneys general are likely to extract plenty of new information in their states and that the reports they generate, much like Pennsylvania\u2019s, \u201cwill be good for painting a picture for the public to understand that this is a systemic problem. It\u2019s a real positive step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nDespite obstacles, many attorneys general are seeking to bring criminal cases, both to punish offenders and draw public attention to sexual abuse by clergy members.\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D), who oversaw the grand jury that issued the bombshell report, said he has since spoken with 40 of his colleagues around the country and urged them to be aggressive in mining the church\u2019s archives and filing charges. After the 2002 crisis, many states expanded their criminal statutes, and 41 states, the District and the federal government now have no time limits for at least some child sexual abuse charges, according to Child USA.\n\n\u201cThe church shouldn\u2019t get to play by different rules,\u201d Shapiro told The Washington Post editorial board, \u201cand for too long they\u2019ve been allowed to play by different rules.\u201d\n\nThe church\u2019s response to the civil actions has been mixed. Some Catholic officials complain that the church has been unfairly targeted. Diocesan lawyers are pushing back behind the scenes, for example resisting changes to state statutes of limitations. At the same time, most bishops have publicly voiced support for the probes.\n\n\u201cIf they say we need to do something different, we will,\u201d said Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, of Chicago. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of admitting mistakes and fixing things.\u201d\n\nThe wheels begin to turn\n\nThe result of a two-year investigation, the 800-page Pennsylvania grand-jury report was graphic in detailing repeated incidents of sexual molestation by more than 1,000 priests in six dioceses. In strong language, it openly condemned the church\u2019s role in covering up the abuse. Archbishop Donald Wuerl of the Archdiocese of Washington was forced to retire after allegations that he covered up clergy sex abuse in Pittsburgh when he was bishop there.\n\n\u201cPriests were raping little boys and girls,\u201d the grand jury wrote, \u201cand the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing, they hid it all. For decades.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for many of the country\u2019s top law enforcement officials to capitalize on the outrage the report sparked.\n\nSince the report\u2019s release Aug. 14, attorneys general in Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, D.C., have launched criminal investigations into the church.\n\nIn Illinois, Madigan said that her staff has received hundreds of emails and calls to its reporting hotline for victims since August, and that she has reviewed about half of them.\n\n\u201cThey are sad, profound, horrible stories,\u201d she told The Post. \u201cSome are people who were victimized years ago and never said anything.\u201d\n\nThe ability of the attorneys general to investigate and act on reports of abuse is limited by jurisdiction and statutes of limitations that apply to criminal and civil cases.\n\nEven in the majority of states where criminal statutes for child abuse crimes are not a significant barrier, not all attorneys general have the power to prosecute the cases.\n\nIn Nebraska, for example, the attorney general \u201chas a long history of investigating and prosecuting child abuse and child sexual assault cases throughout the state,\u201d spokeswoman Suzanne Gage said.\n\nBy contrast, in Missouri, criminal jurisdiction lies with local prosecutors, so Attorney General Josh Hawley (R), who was elected this month to the U.S. Senate, requested Catholic dioceses voluntarily turn over \u201call evidence that would be gained with subpoena power,\u201d spokeswoman Mary Compton said.\n\nThat\u2019s a less-than-ideal approach because it allows church officials to withhold documents if they are inclined, said Shapiro, the Pennsylvania attorney general.\n\nShapiro was able to use an authority few attorneys general have \u2014 the ability to impanel a statewide grand jury \u2014 to subpoena documents from churches across Pennsylvania.\n\nBut some diocesan lawyers have warned that grand-jury reports are dangerous because they imply guilt when none has been proved in court.\n\nKim Viti Fiorentino, the Washington archdiocese\u2019s lawyer, said the \u201cflawed process\u201d of such a report, without due process, \u201cfails the survivors,\u201d and thus the whole document should be questioned.\n\nCivil lawsuits are another hammer prosecutors can use, and the level of proof is lower: A preponderance of the evidence, or just more than half of the proof, is accepted, rather than the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard in criminal cases.\n\nThe statutes of limitations on civil actions are much narrower. In most states, there\u2019s a limit of no more than five years from the time of the alleged acts, and some states have limits as short as two years. Advocates are calling for states to expand time limits or create new windows of availability for victims of sexual abuse, but so far even in Pennsylvania that movement has not made much progress. Of 15 states considering such changes this year, only two legislatures extended the civil statute of limitations, although Child USA\u2019s Hamilton says New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania are likely to next year.\n\n\u201cThe most information the public ever gets is from the civil lawsuits,\u201d Hamilton said, because defendants are required to answer questions and provide documentation, unlike in criminal cases.\n\nProsecutors\u2019 access to church archives and the resulting public reports citing the names and actions of the abusers also have great value, advocates say.\n\nThe lists assist victims who may still have viable legal claims, and for those whose cases are too old for legal recourse, \u201cit helps those victims feel vindicated,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\nWhile some dioceses have begun publishing lists on their own, many Catholics and victim advocates are skeptical about how far the church will go in excavating its past.\n\nIllinois Supreme Court Justice Anne M. Burke, who in the early 2000s chaired the National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Young People created by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the lay board recommended in 2004 that the church post the names of abusers and that it include adults as victims. While some have done so over the years, most never did.\n\n\u201cPeople are still wondering: Who are the abusers?\u201d Burke said. \u201cAre they still in ministry? . . . Civil authorities are the only vehicle so we can know for sure.\u201d\n\nMany attorneys general said they will be publishing the names of those credibly accused of abuse at the end of their investigations.\n\n\u201cWe owed it to the residents of New Jersey, and the victims of New Jersey, to find out if there are victims and predator priests here,\u201d New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal (D) said in an interview, echoing many of his colleagues. \u201cI think the end is going to be dictated largely by what the investigation yields. If viable charges are there, and the statute allows it, we\u2019ll bring those.\u201d\n\nImpact on the Catholic Church\n\nExperts who work with U.S. dioceses on financial and legal matters say church leaders are worried about the growing list of state investigations and aren\u2019t sure where the effort is heading \u2014 and what it could mean.\n\nThe largest financial and criminal implications depend, experts said, on whether more states open windows in their statutes of limitation and whether the Justice Department, with its investigation in Philadelphia, expands its look at the church. Last month, federal prosecutors sent a letter to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops instructing the group to preserve all abuse-related records nationwide.\n\nCharles E. Zech, of the Center for the Study of Church Management at the Villanova School of Business, said most bishops or diocesan officials probably won\u2019t welcome the probes.\n\n\u201cThe church is very secretive. The fact that they have to open their records, to show the public what\u2019s happened in the past \u2014 good or bad. It\u2019s the nature of clericalism\u201d to buck against this, Zech said.\n\nMany are particularly unwilling to share accountability with laypeople, he added.\n\nThe disagreement among bishops regarding the involvement of laypeople was evident at the semiannual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cThese probes will damage a lot of reputations,\u201d Zech said, noting that since the early 2000s, the U.S. church has spent about $4 billion to pay victims\u2019 settlements and the church\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nZech doubted the financial impact would be crippling to the U.S. church unless more states chose to extend their statutes of limitations for civil suits.\n\nHe predicted more states will open probes because it\u2019s \u201ca political windfall.\u201d The public \u2014 Catholics included \u2014 have no faith in the moral standing of the bishops and want the cases to see light, Zech said.\n\nThe investigations also are welcomed by the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (SNAP), a national group.\n\n\u201cThe church, after 16 years, has had ample opportunity and time to right the ship,\u201d said Mark Crawford, the director of SNAP\u2019s New Jersey office.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for the state to remedy problems the church has failed to fix \u2014 starting with making public the name of every priest accused of abuse in New Jersey, he said.\n\nHowever, Crawford said he would prefer to see statutes of limitation lifted, so these men could be not only named but punished. \u201cState investigations across the country, that\u2019s only half of it. Where\u2019s the justice for those victims?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the part where our lawmakers need to find the fortitude to stand up \u2014 regardless of this large, iconic institution \u2014 to say this needs to be fixed.\u201d\n\nWhen he reported his own abuser to his diocese, Crawford said, he got the sense that the leaders were stalling so that the statute of limitations would expire. \u201cWhen I had first told them, he\u2019d be in jail to this day. But now he\u2019s a free man because they waited for the criminal statute of limitations to expire.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Greg Porter", "title": "P.M.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nHere are four takeaways from the Redskins\u2019 31-23 loss to the Cowboys on Thursday at AT&T Stadium.\n\nToo many turnovers: It\u2019s generally better to give than to receive, but unfortunately for Colt McCoy and the Redskins, that sentiment doesn\u2019t apply to football games. Making his first start since 2014 in place of Alex Smith, McCoy gave a lot. The former University of Texas star, who led a stirring upset of the Cowboys at AT&T Stadium in 2014, threw three interceptions against a Dallas defense that had managed four interceptions in its previous nine games. Those three mistakes, the last one with less than five minutes remaining and Washington threatening to cut into an 11-point deficit, overshadowed the things McCoy did well, including scrambling to avoid sacks and hitting Vernon Davis in stride for a 53-yard touchdown in the second quarter. The Redskins may not have won Thursday\u2019s game with Smith at the helm, but it\u2019s a safe bet the quarterback with five interceptions all season before he was lost for the year last week wouldn\u2019t have thrown a trifecta of picks on Turkey Day. Meanwhile, Dallas hasn\u2019t turned the ball over in any of its six wins.\n\nNo answer for Amari Cooper: When the Redskins defeated the Cowboys at FedEx Field last month, Cooper was still a member of the Raiders. Washington\u2019s secondary probably wishes that had never changed. The loss in Landover prompted Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to make a move, which he did by sending a future first-round draft pick to Oakland in exchange for Cooper the following day. Cooper looked worthy of the hefty price on Thursday, finishing with eight catches for 180 yards. He repeatedly burned the Redskins on third down and caught touchdown passes of 40 and 90 yards during a five-minute span in the third quarter after Washington took a 13-10 lead. Cooper was the primary reason Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott finished with a season-high 289 yards passing.\n\nEzekiel Elliott outshines Adrian Peterson: Dallas got the better of Washington on the ground, too. After being limited to 33 yards rushing in the teams\u2019 first meeting, Ezekiel Elliott opened the scoring with a 16-yard touchdown run and finished with 121 yards on 26 carries. The Redskins did a solid job of pressuring Prescott in the first half, when they registered all four of their sacks, but the defensive line seemed to wear down after halftime and Washington\u2019s issues defending the run over the last month continued. Offensively, left tackle Trent Williams\u2019s return from a broken thumb wasn\u2019t enough to propel Adrian Peterson to a big day. Peterson had 35 yards rushing on 12 carries, only five of which came after halftime.\n\nBuckle up for the stretch run: In falling to 1-8 all-time on Thanksgiving against the Cowboys and failing to sweep the season series against Dallas for the first time since 2012, the Redskins missed a golden opportunity to put a stranglehold on the NFC East division race. A win would\u2019ve given Washington a two-game lead with five games remaining, although a season sweep effectively would\u2019ve put the Redskins three games clear of Dallas. Instead, the rivals are tied atop the division at 6-5. Washington returns to action in 11 days at Philadelphia on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d The Cowboys host the red-hot New Orleans Saints next Thursday. Don\u2019t bank on the division being decided until well into December.\n\nLive updates and analysis\n\nFinal: Cowboys 31, Redskins 23\n\nThe Cowboys and Redskins are now tied atop the NFC East at 6-5.\n\n4th Quarter\n\nCowboys recover onside kick: Allen Hurns recovered Dustin Hopkins\u2019 onside kick, and that should do it. (Cowboys 31, Redskins 23, 1:12 4th Quarter)\n\nDustin Hopkins\u2019s field goal cuts into Dallas\u2019s lead: Hopkins booted a 31-yard field goal to pull the Redskins within eight points. The field goal came after officials missed a blatant helmet-to-helmet hit by Cowboys defensive back Xavier Woods on Jordan Reed, which resulted in an incompletion on third down. (Cowboys 31, Redskins 23, 1:13 4th Quarter)\n\nJordan Reed has every right to be furious, clear hit to the helmet and it goes uncalled.

If the Redskins don\u2019t pick up the first down here, look for them to attempt a field goal and try for an onside kick. (Cowboys 31, Redskins 20, 2:00 4th Quarter)\n\nRedskins get the ball back: Washington used two of its three timeouts to preserve as much time as possible before forcing a Dallas punt after Colt McCoy\u2019s third interception of the game. The Redskins started their latest drive from their own 46-yard line needing two scores. (Cowboys 31, Redskins 20, 3:50 4th Quarter)\n\nColt McCoy throws third interception: Cowboys cornerback Chidobe Awuzie appeared to get away with a hold on Maurice Harris before tipping a wobbly pass from Colt McCoy into the air in Dallas territory. Xavier Woods came down with the interception at the Cowboys\u2019 14-yard line, ending Washington\u2019s bid to make it a one-score game.

To no one\u2019s surprise, Ezekiel Elliott got the call, but he was brought down by Jonathan Allen for no gain. The Redskins have life, but they\u2019ll be without defensive tackle Matt Ioannidis for the remainder of the game.

Washington\u2019s Danny Johnson took advantage of the opportunity, returning Maher\u2019s kick 44 yards to the Dallas 44. Six plays later, Kapri Bibbs plunged into the end zone from one-yard out to cap a drive that took fewer than three minutes off the clock. The Redskins\u2019 defense needs a stop, but Washington isn\u2019t out of this one. (Cowboys 31, Redskins 20, 11:43 4th Quarter)\n\nDak Prescott gives Cowboys a three-score lead with TD scramble: On third-and-goal from the Washington 5-yard line, Prescott dropped back, avoided what looked to be Washington\u2019s fifth sack of the game and navigated his way into the end zone with a five-yard run that covered closer to 30 yards. Prescott was assessed a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct after Ezekiel Elliott lifted him into the Salvation Army\u2019s red bucket to celebrate the score. (Cowboys 31, Redskins 13, 14:11 4th Quarter)\n\nDAK WITH THE MOVES.\n\n\n\nWhat a run for the Cowboys TD! #WASvsDAL pic.twitter.com/Xv92hwYsDb \u2014 FOX Sports (@FOXSports) November 23, 2018\n\n3rd Quarter\n\nColt McCoy throws his second interception: This game is getting away from the Redskins. Washington\u2019s second play after Amari Cooper\u2019s 90-yard touchdown catch resulted in Demarcus Lawrence\u2019s first career interception. The Cowboys took over at the Washington 17-yard line, in position to add to their 11-point lead. (Cowboys 24, Redskins 13, 1:31 3rd Quarter)\n\nAmari Cooper extends Cowboys\u2019 lead with 90-yard touchdown catch: Well, that escalated quickly. On second-and-nine from the Dallas 10-yard line, Dak Prescott found Cooper over the middle near the 30-yard line for a first down. Cooper was determined to get more, and proceeded to break a would-be tackle by Fabian Moreau and outrace safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix down the left sideline for a 90-yard touchdown, the longest in the NFL this year.

This time, the call on Maurice Harris backed Washington up to the Dallas 38-yard line, the edge of field goal range. Colt McCoy threw incomplete on the next play and the Redskins elected to punt rather than go for it or attempt a 55-yard field goal. (Cowboys 17, Redskins 13, 3:05 3rd Quarter)\n\nTrent Williams is back in the game for the Redskins: That\u2019s good news for Washington and the veteran left tackle. (Cowboys 17, Redskins 13, 6:00 3rd Quarter)\n\nCowboys answer with a touchdown: After the Redskins took their first lead of the game, Dallas went 75 yards on six plays to go back on top. Amari Cooper capped the drive with a 40-yard touchdown catch, the former Raider\u2019s longest play with the Cowboys since being acquired at the trade deadline. Cooper burned Quinton Dunbar on the play, which upped his totals to six catches for 86 yards.

Dustin Hopkins missed the ensuing extra point, which could be a factor later. Hopkins\u2019s kick appeared to sail just over the left upright. (Redskins 13, Cowboys 10, 9:02 3rd Quarter)\n\nCOLT!

Quinn returned Chris Jones\u2019s punt from the Dallas end zone 29 yards to the Dallas 25-yard line, giving the Redskins their best starting field position of the game.

Adrian Peterson ran for one yard and caught a pass in the flat for no gain before Colt McCoy scrambled for two yards on third-and-long. (Cowboys 10, Redskins 7, 12:06 3rd Quarter)\n\nHalftime: Cowboys 10, Redskins 7\n\nColt McCoy was 7 for 14 for 116 yards, one touchdown and one interception in the first half of his first start since 2014. Adrian Peterson has found the going tough against Dallas\u2019s defense, with 17 yards rushing on seven carries, while Washington has had its hands full with Ezekiel Elliott (11 carries for 58 yards). The Redskins will get the ball first to start the second half.\n\n2nd Quarter\n\nTeams trade possessions before the half: Washington burned only 21 seconds off the clock while looking for points before the break, giving Dallas a chance to add to its lead. After an uncharacteristically short punt by Tress Way, the Cowboys began their final drive of the half at their own 40-yard line with two timeouts and 1:02 on the clock. Dak Prescott\u2019s 14-yard pass to Amari Cooper on first down put Dallas on the edge of field goal range, but a Preston Smith sack on the next series, Washington\u2019s fourth sack of the game, helped end the threat. (Cowboys 10, Redskins 7, End of 1st Half)\n\nDallas takes 10-7 lead on short field goal: Brett Maher drilled a 28-yard field goal to cap a 13-play, 65-yard drive that should be considered a minor win for the Redskins\u2019 defense. The Cowboys had first-and-goal from the Washington four-yard line before Dak Prescott underthrew Noah Brown, who was wide open at the goal line, and was then sacked by Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith for a loss of 13 yards. (Cowboys 10, Redskins 7, 1:28 2nd Quarter)\n\nCowboys are on the move: Dallas is at the Washington 20-yard line at the two-minute warning, thanks to an impressive feat of strength by quarterback Dak Prescott. Despite being sandwiched in the backfield by Stacy McGee and Preston Smith on third down, Prescott remained on his feet and managed to complete a 12-yard pass to wide open rookie Michael Gallup before Smith dragged him to the turf. Prescott, who is 13 for 15 passing, flexed after the play. (Redskins 7, Cowboys 7, 2:00 2nd Quarter)\n\nVernon Davis ties the game with a long touchdown catch: Davis dropped a potential touchdown pass against the Texans last week and committed a costly penalty earlier in this game, but he ran past Cowboys linebacker Damien Wilson and hauled in a 53-yard touchdown pass from Colt McCoy on the first play of Washington\u2019s fourth drive. The play was the longest of the season by the Redskins.

Prescott managed to extend the ball across the goal line while being sacked by Daron Payne to avoid a safety, and while Ezekiel Elliott gave the Cowboys some breathing room with an 11-yard run on third-and-13, the Redskins will start their next drive with excellent field position at their own 47. (Cowboys 7, Redskins 0, 7:12 2nd Quarter)\n\nAdrian Peterson gets going, but Redskins\u2019 drive stalls: Peterson returned to the game after heading to the locker room with an apparent shoulder injury and ran the ball well on Washington\u2019s third drive. His nine-yard run set up a second-and-one at the Dallas 49-yard line, but the Redskins went backward from there. After a false start by Vernon Davis and a Washington timeout, Trey Quinn was dropped for a loss of three on a screen pass and Colt McCoy threw incomplete for Vernon Davis on third down. Tress Way\u2019s ensuing punt was downed at the Dallas 5-yard line. (Cowboys 7, Redskins 0, 9:33 2nd Quarter)\n\n1st Quarter\n\nWashington\u2019s defense gets to Dak Prescott: The Redskins sacked the Cowboys QB four times during the teams\u2019s previous meeting last month at FedEx Field. Jonathan Allen tallied Washington\u2019s first sack on Thursday on third down on the final play of the first quarter. (Cowboys 7, Redskins 0, End of 1st Quarter)\n\nRedskins\u2019 second drive ends with an interception: Colt McCoy converted twice on third-and-long with completions to Jordan Reed, including once after officials missed a blatant face mask penalty on Cowboys defensive tackle Daniel Ross, but McCoy made his first serious mistake of the game after Washington crossed midfield. On third-and-four from the Dallas 41-yard line, McCoy lofted a pass down the left sideline for rookie Trey Quinn, but Anthony Brown was there for the easy pick. Adrian Peterson had three carries for one yard on the drive, and was later shown heading into the Redskins\u2019 locker room. (Cowboys 7, Redskins 0, 2:54 1st Quarter)\n\nCowboys with the pick!

Dak Prescott threw complete to Blake Jarwin on third-and-long, but the tight end was dragged down just short of the line to gain. (Cowboys 7, Redskins 0, 6:52 1st Quarter)\n\nRedskins go three-and-out: Washington\u2019s first drive ended with a 53-yard punt by Tress Way. It was almost much worse. On third-and-one from the Redskins\u2019 34-yard line, Colt McCoy dropped back to pass, but seeing no one, decided to tuck the ball and run. Cowboys linebacker Jaylon Smith sacked McCoy and jarred the ball loose, but Chase Roullier pounced on it for Washington to prevent a turnover. Adrian Peterson didn\u2019t touch the ball on the Redskins\u2019 first series. (Cowboys 7, Redskins 0, 8:28 1st Quarter)\n\nCowboys make it look easy on opening drive: This wasn\u2019t the start the Redskins\u2019 defense was hoping for. Dallas received the opening kickoff and marched 75 yards on 10 plays, with Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s 16-yard touchdown run providing the game\u2019s first points. Dak Prescott was 5 for 6 for 44 yards, including a pair of third-down completions to Amari Cooper. The Cowboys did it without starting left tackle Tyron Smith, who is active despite suffering from a stinger, but opened the game on the sideline. Elliott celebrated his touchdown by putting $21 in the enormous Salvation Army bucket on the field at AT&T Stadium.

Washington\u2019s defense limited Ezekiel Elliott to 33 yards rushing on 15 carries in the teams\u2019 first meeting, but the Redskins have struggled against the run over the last three weeks. During the pregame show, Fox\u2019s Jay Glazer reported that Redskins quarterback Alex Smith will be out 8-10 months as a result of his broken leg, meaning he likely won\u2019t be ready for the start of next season.\n\nInactives\n\nSome good news for the Redskins: Left tackle Trent Williams and cornerback Quinton Dunbar are both active.\n\nT Trent Williams and CB Quinton Dunbar are suited up today.#WASvsDAL inactives: pic.twitter.com/TR8ve99xJq \u2014 Washington Redskins (@Redskins) November 22, 2018\n\nTrent Williams thumb seems good enough to throw a giant medicine ball against the stadium wall. pic.twitter.com/efPJADeHjH \u2014 Les Carpenter (@Lescarpenter) November 22, 2018\n\nPreview\n\nWashington Redskins (6-4) at Dallas Cowboys (5-5)\n\nKickoff: 4:30 p.m., AT&T Stadium\n\nTV: Fox | Radio: 630, 980 AM; 92.7, 94.3, 105.9 FM\n\nLine: Cowboys by 7.5\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 11th appearance on Thanksgiving features higher stakes and more drama than most of the previous 10. Washington leads the host Cowboys by one game in the NFC East division race and already defeated Dallas last month, when Brett Maher\u2019s potential game-tying field goal doinked off the left upright in the final seconds at FedEx Field. Since then, the Cowboys have acquired wide receiver Amari Cooper in a trade with the Raiders, and the Redskins have lost quarterback Alex Smith to a broken leg.\n\nColt McCoy, who nearly engineered a comeback win in relief of Smith last week, will make his first start in four years for Washington. The former University of Texas star will do so at the site of one of his greatest performances as a pro, a 20-17 overtime win against the Cowboys at AT&T Stadium on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d in 2014. The Redskins were 9.5-point underdogs in that game; Dallas, which has won two straight behind running back Ezekiel Elliott, is a 7.5-point favorite on Thursday.

Britain officially leaves the 28-nation EU \u2014 the first country to ever do so \u2014 on March 29.\n\n\u201cThe draft text that we have agreed with the (European) Commission is a good deal for our country and for our partners in the EU,\u201d May said.\n\nMay is due to travel to Brussels on Saturday for further Brexit meetings, including with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a day before a summit of the EU\u2019s 27 other leaders at which both the political declaration on post-Brexit relations as well as the divorce agreement, which alone has legal status, are expected to be formally signed off.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement needs to be sealed soon to leave enough time for the European Parliament and the U.K. Parliament to endorse it.\n\nMay told lawmakers that the outlines for the future help protect jobs, end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the U.K., give British fishermen more control and avoid the return of a hard border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.\n\nShe also said the agreement paves the way for a free trade agreement with the bloc as well as allowing Britain to forge new trade deals around the world.\n\nBut her rosy predictions met with resistance on many fronts in Parliament, which is expected to vote on the Brexit plan next month.\n\nAt the moment, it looks precarious for the prime minister given the number of lawmakers who have expressed discontent with the proposals, notably the 585-page legal treaty that deals with the terms of Britain\u2019s departure, including what the country owes the EU.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain\u2019s main opposition Labour Party, poured scorn on the agreement on future relations, describing it a \u201c26 pages of waffle\u201d that represented a failure of the Conservative Party and May during two years of negotiations.\n\nCorbyn said the agreement \u201crepresents the worst of all worlds\u201d and that Britain will have \u201cno say\u201d over EU rules that will continue to apply in Britain.\n\n\u201cThis is the blindfold Brexit we all feared,\u201d he said. \u201cA leap into the dark.\u201d\n\nMay is likely to need some Labour lawmakers to back her plan if she has realistic hopes of winning approval, given that her Conservative Party does not enjoy a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nMay also faced criticism from hard-line Conservative Party Brexiteers, notably Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, and from others who pressed May to back a second referendum on the whole Brexit proposition.\n\nIf May fails to get a majority in Parliament, it\u2019s unclear what would then happen. Some lawmakers argue that the country would end up crashing out of the EU on Brexit day with no deal, a scenario that could see tariffs slapped on exports and restrictions imposed on workers. Others hope Parliament could back a second referendum in the hope the public would call the whole thing off.\n\nThe political declaration was agreed upon at a technical level by negotiators and endorsed Thursday by the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, which is overseeing Brexit negotiations.\n\n\u201cThis declaration establishes the parameters of an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation, law enforcement and criminal justice, foreign policy, security and defense and wider areas of cooperation,\u201d according to the document.\n\nIt also talks about the close ties that have been cemented after 45 years of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU and notes that the \u201cparties envisage having a trading relationship on goods that is as close as possible, with a view to facilitating the ease of legitimate trade.\u201d\n\nIn a speech in Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel underlined that \u201cBritain should remain a partner, remain a friend\u201d but she underscored the difficulties that may arise in any attempt to keep services seamless.\n\n\u201cWe have to say honestly that, in the services sector, we don\u2019t have a great deal of experience with international free trade agreements,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut we want to see that as a future relationship.\u201d\n\nOne stumbling block relates to Gibraltar, the tiny territory at the tip of the Iberian Peninsula that was ceded to Britain in 1713 but is still claimed by Spain.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said earlier this week that his government \u201ccannot accept\u201d Gibraltar\u2019s future being determined by negotiations at the EU level.\n\nMay said Thursday that she has spoken with Sanchez and that she is \u201cconfident\u201d there will be a resolution on Sunday \u201cthat delivers for the whole U.K. family, including Gibraltar.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCook reported from Brussels.

Julda is part of a group of Haitian immigrants who started the Association of the Defense of Haitian Migrants to give the community a place to help itself with everything from Spanish lessons to paying medical bills. (Ramon Espinosa/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 A few blocks from a shelter housing members of a Central American migrant caravan sits the first Haitian restaurant to open in Tijuana, a bustling eatery that has come to symbolize an immigrant success story in this Mexican border city where Haitians are now a part of the fabric, landing jobs, studying and marrying locals.\n\nTijuana welcomed thousands of Haitians to pursue a scaled-down American dream south of the border after the U.S. closed its doors on them more than two years ago. But it has not shown the same tolerance so far toward the Central Americans, who have met official complaints and anti-caravan protests even though most of the people in this city are migrants or the offspring of migrants.\n\nThat\u2019s raising questions about how the newest group will integrate if it doesn\u2019t don\u2019t get into the U.S. or return home.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has made a point of saying the city is not happy with the caravan migrants who began arriving last week, and he compared the Central American group unfavorably with the roughly 3,000 Haitians who ended up staying after their bid to reach the U.S. failed.\n\n\u201cThe Haitians arrived with their papers, with a clear vision,\u201d Gastelum said in an interview posted on the city\u2019s Facebook page. They came \u201cin an orderly way, they never asked us for food or shelter,\u201d renting apartments and making their own food. He said the Haitians found jobs and \u201cinserted themselves in the city\u2019s economy\u201d and had not been involved in any disturbances.\n\nBy contrast, Gastelum said, the caravan of Central Americans \u201chad arrived all of sudden, with a lot of people \u2014 not all ... but a lot \u2014 were aggressive and cocky.\u201d\n\nVictor Clark-Alfaro, a professor of Latin American studies at San Diego State University who lives in Tijuana, attributes the backlash to the way the caravan arrived \u2014 suddenly with thousands pouring in. Others point to social media and the hostile rhetoric of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said it harbored criminals and gang members and was planning an \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\nMany also say the actions of a few are tarnishing the image of the roughly 4,000 migrants who are camped in Tijuana. In the past week, city officials have arrested three dozen caravan members for drug possession, public intoxication, disturbing the peace and resisting police, and said they would be deported to their home countries.\n\nIt\u2019s also only been months since an earlier caravan of Central Americans arrived, and some of them are still in the city waiting to get asylum in the U.S. That has added to fears here that it could be the start of a never-ending deluge.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana\u2019s main crossing to San Diego, and there was already a waiting list of 3,000 when the new migrants arrived, so most will have to wait months to even be considered for asylum.\n\nTijuana has a long history as a kind of Ellis Island for U.S.-bound migrants. It receives up to 80,000 a year from across Mexico, Latin America and more recently as far away as India and Africa. The city has large pockets of Chinese and Korean immigrants.\n\nCentral Americans have been coming to the city since the civil wars of the 80s in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.\n\nMany in the newly arrived caravan, however, are destitute people who left their homelands at the spur of the moment and have been utterly dependent on handouts along their journey.\n\nMany of the Haitians, meanwhile, arrived with at least some resources after working in Brazil, though despite what the mayor said, they also stayed at shelters after taking an accidental route to Tijuana from their impoverished Caribbean homeland. The last group of Haitians moved out of the Padre Chava shelter in April.\n\nBrazil and its neighbors took in the Haitians after that country\u2019s 2010 earthquake. As construction jobs for the 2016 Summer Olympics ended and Brazil\u2019s economy slumped, they crossed 10 countries by plane, boat, bus and on foot to San Diego, where U.S. authorities initially let them in on humanitarian grounds.\n\nThen President Barack Obama shifted course in 2016 and started deporting Haitian arrivals. Many decided to stay in Mexico after the government gave them temporary transit permits and have since applied for Mexican residency. The majority in the Central American caravan so far have refused Mexico\u2019s repeated offers of residency or asylum and vowed to cross the border.\n\nMany of the Haitians also have college degrees and have been recruited to work for factories that export to the U.S. Some can be found waiting tables and worshipping at congregations that have even added services in Creole.\n\nThey opened beauty parlors, shops and restaurants, like Kriskapab Baborijinal, a bright blue-and-red cafe that is busy serving Mexicans and Haitians daily dishes of coconut rice, mashed plantains and goat stew.\n\nIn the window is a sign for the Association of the Defense of Haitian Migrants. Philocles Julda, 44, is one of 11 Haitian immigrants who started the group a year ago to give the community a place to help itself with everything from Spanish lessons to paying medical bills.\n\nJulda said he too wanted to get to the U.S. when he first arrived to Tijuana and still wishes he was earning dollars, but said he has been able to make a life here. He works at a factory.\n\n\u201cI feel for the migrants who are arriving from other countries just like we did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you do adapt.\u201d\n\nAnd work is plentiful in Tijuana, whose economy has been growing and whose factories have thousands of openings.\n\n\u201cWe have been looking for workers for quite a while,\u201d said Alejandrina Yanez, who works in human resources at a factory that makes warehouse storage racks for Costco, Home Depot and other international companies.\n\nYanez went to the Padre Chava shelter Wednesday to see if any migrants were interested in jobs that pay about $100 a week.\n\nOmin Velasquez, 26, of Tocoa, Honduras, was intrigued. Velasquez came with the caravan but decided not to continue on to the U.S. after seeing the border wall topped with newly-installed rows of razor wire.\n\nHe said it took him some days to decide, but he now feels that there are enough opportunities in Tijuana and support from locals that it\u2019s not worth the risk of crossing into the U.S. He has started his paperwork to get a Mexican visa to stay.\n\n\u201cThere is so much work here,\u201d he said. \u201cI no longer feel the need to go to the U.S.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Courtesy of Grzegorz Niedzwiedzki via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nBERLIN \u2014 A giant, plant-eating creature with a beak-like mouth and reptilian features may have roamed the Earth during the late Triassic period more than 200 million years ago, scientists said Thursday.\n\nIn a paper published Thursday by the journal Science, Polish researchers claim their find overturns the notion that the only giant plant-eaters at the time were dinosaurs.\n\nThe elephant-sized creature, known as Lisowicia bojani after a village in southern Poland where its remains were found, belonged to the same evolutionary branch as mammals.\n\nSimilar fossils from so-called dicynodonts have been found elsewhere, but they were dated to be from an earlier period, before a series of natural disasters wiped out most species on Earth.\n\n\u201cWe used to think that after the end-Permian extinction, mammals and their relatives retreated to the shadows while dinosaurs rose up and grew to huge sizes,\u201d said Grzegorz Niedzwiedzki, a paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden who co-authored the paper.\n\nThe discovery of giant dicynodonts living at the same time as sauropods \u2014 a branch of the dinosaur family that later produced the iconic long-necked diplodocus \u2014 suggests environmental factors in the late Triassic period may have driven the evolution of gigantism, the researchers said.\n\nChristian Kammerer, a dicynodont specialist at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences not involved in the find, said the size of Lisowicia was \u201cstartling.\u201d\n\n\u201cLarge dicynodonts have been known before in both the Permian and the Triassic, but never at this scale,\u201d he said.\n\nKammerer said that while dicynodonts and dinosaurs existed at the same time, there\u2019s no evidence yet that they lived in the same habitats. He also questioned the study\u2019s conclusions about Lisowicia\u2019s posture\n\n\u201cHowever, overall I think this is a very intriguing and important paper, and shows us that there is a still a lot left to learn about early mammal relatives in the Triassic,\u201d said Kammerer.\n\n___\n\nFollow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Mark Makela/for The Washington Post)\n\nIt\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year . . . for dog lovers. We speak, of course, of a sacred Thanksgiving tradition for millions of Americans: Before the turkey and football, they curl up on the couch to watch the National Dog Show.\n\nThe contest airs on NBC after the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, allowing Mom, Dad, kids, Grandma \u2014 and yes, even the family pet \u2014 to see the four-legged competitors, root for their favorite breeds and guess who will win best in show.\n\nThe 20 million fans glued to the television this year already know the answer: GCHP Pinnacle Tennessee Whiskey, a fawn-colored whippet from Sugar Valley, Ga. Whiskey, with his elegant lines and big brown eyes, beat the crowd favorites \u2014 a Doberman pinscher and King Charles Cavalier spaniel \u2014 and the front-runner, a wire fox terrier that had tons of buzz and a glittering string of best-in-show victories from around the globe.\n\nAside from being wildly popular, the two-hour broadcast has a secret, rare in this day of breaking news and social media: The show was actually held last weekend, but the results remained closely guarded for six days.\n\n\u201cI have a great friend from the Irish bar we used to hang out at who\u2019s a big-time sports gambler,\u201d says David Frei, who has been a co-host of the National Dog Show since it first aired in 2002. \u201cHe would always ask who won. I said, \u2018You\u2019re not trying to turn this into some sort of a bet, are you?\u2019 He\u2019s said: \u2018No, no. I\u2019m going to dinner with my family and I just want them to think I\u2019m pretty smart about dogs.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd that, my friends, is the simple genius behind this show. People love dogs. They love to own them: There are 90 million pet dogs in the United States. They love to shop for them: Owners will spend $59 billion this year on food, vet care, toys, outfits and more, including dog birthdays. And they love to watch them on Thanksgiving: The National Dog Show is the highest-rated canine contest in the country, trouncing both Puppy Bowl on Super Bowl Sunday and the Westminster Dog Show in February.\n\nFrei\u2019s co-host, actor John O\u2019Hurley, calls it the \u201chappiest day of the year. I\u2019ve always said I\u2019m a better person with a dog in my lap. They just have an infectious influence on our lives. You see it in this room: Everyone was happy today.\u201d\n\n1 of 27 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 All dressed up at the National Dog Show View Photos The competition featuring more than 2,000 dogs and 200 breeds airs on NBC after the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Caption The competition featuring more than 2,000 dogs and 200 breeds airs on NBC after the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Mark Makela/for The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nThe show is the brainchild of Jon Miller, president of programming for NBC Sports. In 2002, the Bethesda native saw Christopher Guest's movie \"Best in Show,\" a comedy about a fictitious dog show. The lifelong dog lover thought a real dog show could work on television if the time slot was right \u2014 say, a family holiday. He persuaded Purina to sponsor it, and contacted the oldest dog show in the country: The Kennel Club of Philadelphia, which first exhibited dogs at the 1876 Centennial Exposition.\n\nThen Miller went to his bosses, who were dubious that a dog show could be called sports, or even good television. But reruns of \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d after Macy\u2019s parade had lousy ratings, so Miller got the green light to have those two hours \u2014 but only for that year.\n\n\u201dYou know what?\u201d Jeff Zucker, who was then his top boss, told him. \u201cIt can\u2019t do worse. Let\u2019s give it a shot.\u201d\n\n[Your dog and cat wish they could tell you this]\n\nThe renamed \u201cNational Dog Show\u201d first aired in November of that year. Miller prayed it would match the ratings of \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d about 1 million viewers. He was at the movies the next morning when Zucker called: \u201cDid you see the numbers for your dog show?\u201d More than 18 million people had watched \u2014 bigger ratings than most prime-time hits. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen a lot in our business,\u201d says Miller. An overnight classic (and a big moneymaker for NBC ) was born.\n\nFrom the beginning, the show has had two co-hosts: Frei, an internationally recognized expert on purebred dogs and father of the therapy dog movement, and dog lover O\u2019Hurley, best known for playing J. Peterman on \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the brains behind the operation,\u201d jokes Frei.\n\n\u201cAnd I take that genius and make it palatable for America,\u201d counters O\u2019Hurley.\n\nThe two are close friends and rock stars at dog shows, constantly being stopped for selfies in person or, failing that, with their cardboard cutouts. But both insist the dogs deserve the attention.\n\n\u201cWe want to get as many camera close-ups of the dogs so that everybody has a chance to feel what we feel about them,\u201d O\u2019Hurley says.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, Hall of Fame sportscaster Mary Carillo added the show to her duties (pro tennis, Olympics) because she adores dogs. She\u2019s worked both Westminster and this show \u2014 Westminster is a bit more reserved, she says, while the National Dog Show is more fun.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a more relaxed atmosphere here,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s something very happy-making about seeing beautiful, well-\n\nbehaved dogs.\u201d\n\nBut make no mistake: This is serious business for competitive dogdom. There were more than 2,000 dogs in the exhibition hall just outside Philly, and it was possible to shake paws with each one because this is one of three \u201cbench shows\u201d in the United States \u2014 with designated spaces backstage where the dogs are displayed when they\u2019re not being judged. It\u2019s a chance to see an astonishing canine variety, from five-pound Yorkies to 200-pound mastiffs. When they\u2019re not in the ring, show dogs are just like any other: Playing, barking, stealing kisses and otherwise being super cute.\n\nEveryone at the National Dog Show is passionate about dogs, which means educating people about the pros and cons of each breed. Purebreds were developed to do specific tasks \u2014 hunt, track, herd, guard and the like \u2014 except toys dogs, which were primarily pets. Judges look for the ideal version of each breed, and each person has a favorite.\n\n\u201cI always lean toward the Irish setters because their posture and the auburn hair flowing in the breeze looks like the redhead who just walked into the cocktail party,\u201d O\u2019Hurley says. Frei loves Afghans; Carillo is partial to terriers because \u201cthey always look like they\u2019re smiling.\u201d\n\n\n\nDana Maines interacts with Squish, an American Stafforshire terrier, at the National Dog Show. (Mark Makela/for The Washington Post)\n\nGhost, a Norwegian buhund, relaxes after his appearance in the ring. (Mark Makela/for The Washington Post)\n\nHow to choose? The toy group pranced into the ring to the \u201cDance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.\u201d (And yes, later they played \u201cWho Let the Dogs Out?\u201d because of course they did.) There were dogs that looked like lions, dogs that looked like mops, dogs that looked like throw pillows and one that looked like a moving carwash.\n\nThe champions are unfazed by the lights, the music, the crowds. They stand still while the judge examines their body, then promenade in the ring. The power of the sassy butt wiggle cannot be denied. It\u2019s a beauty contest and a personality contest.\n\n\u201cHe loves to show,\u201d says Fay Adcox, owner of Ghost, a 4-year-old Norwegian buhund. \u201cHe has attitude. You tell him he\u2019s a good boy, and he just struts his stuff.\u201d\n\nThrough the magic of television, seven hours are edited down to two: highlights from each group, best in show and behind-the-scenes features. Not every breed makes the broadcast, but each one is posted online.\n\nAnother thing on full display in the ring but discreetly edited for family television: doggy manhood. Show dogs cannot be neutered or spayed and must have all their, er, parts intact. The American Kennel Club requires that all males have two testicles, and judges check for fakes. (In Europe, one is enough, but American dogs must have two. U.S.A.!)\n\nBut the real trick is keeping the results under wraps \u2014 no headlines, tweets or photos of the winner. Reporters and photographers are embargoed until the broadcast ends, and there\u2019s been no major breach for 17 years.\n\n\u201cThere is a wave of goodwill that cascades over the dog media and the traditional media,\u201d says Steve Griffith, the show\u2019s public relations director. Hundreds of people, including the general public at the show, are in on the secret because it\u2019s fun and good for the dog world. \u201cOur objective is to make it a wonderful surprise on Thanksgiving Day.\u201d\n\n\n\nSarah Rivkin with Amber, a 1-year-old standard poodle, at the National Dog Show.

(Mark Makela/for The Washington Post)\n\nAfter judging 192 breeds this year, the contest for best in show came down to seven group winners: Bella, a Pembroke Welsh corgi representing the herding group; Billy, a Lhasa apso from the non-sporting group; Ducky, a Chesapeake Bay retriever from the sporting group; King, the wire fox terrier from the terrier group; Bogie, a King Charles Cavalier spaniel from the toy group; Irupe, a Doberman pinscher from the working group; and Whiskey, representing the hound group.\n\nThe runner-up was the Doberman, then the arena went silent. \u201cPick my dog!\u201d a little girl shouted from the audience. Best in show: The judge pointed to the whippet, which caused audible gasps from the crowd.\n\nWhiskey, it should be said, is a beautiful dog. And a very good boy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a typical whippet in personality \u2014 laid-back, enjoyable, clean, easy to house-train, quiet \u2014 and that\u2019s what makes him a lovely dog,\u201d says owner Justin Smithey, who\u2019s been showing the breed for two decades. \u201cHe\u2019s a great show dog because he\u2019s not intimidated by a setting like this.\u201d\n\nActually, the 3-year-old dog is already an old pro on the show circuit: Whiskey is the top hound in the country, and this was his 20th best in show. The grand prize: $1,500, a big ribbon and Purina nibbles served on a silver platter.\n\nBoth Frei and O\u2019Hurley, who always try to second-guess the judges, were surprised. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even my second pick,\u201d O\u2019Hurley says. \u201cThe wire-haired terrier seemed a little sluggish. It was his to lose, and I think he lost it.\u201d\n\nIn the end, does it matter who wins? To the breeders and handlers, of course. To the rest of us, and maybe even the show dogs themselves, probably not. Every dog is a winner in its owner\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cI read somewhere that when you die and go to heaven, every dog you\u2019ve ever loved will run to greet you,\u201d Carillo says. \u201cOn a day like Thanksgiving, you really can be thankful for what they give to your life.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "What to watch in the leading soccer leagues in Europe", "description": "Chelsea faces a tough test when the Premier League resumes this weekend after the international break as Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side visits Tottenham", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/what-to-watch-in-the-leading-soccer-leagues-in-europe/2018/11/22/0c28068e-ee86-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T18:40:14Z", "content": "What to watch in the leading soccer leagues in Europe this weekend: ENGLAND Three teams are unbeaten after the opening 12 games of an English top-flight campaign for the first time in 130 years.

The morning after Chau\u2019s final trip to the island\u2019s shores, the fishermen saw his body being dragged and buried in the sand.\n\nPolice in the city of Port Blair, the capital of India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, this week sent a helicopter and a team of officers by boat to assess whether it is possible to recover the body. U.S. diplomats are also in Port Blair to lend assistance.\n\nChau\u2019s diary reveals a portrait of a young man obsessed with the idea of bringing Christianity to the Sentinelese, who number in the dozens and have lived largely without contact from the outside world for centuries, protected from visitors by Indian law.\n\nIt also shows that Chau knew his mission was illegal.

Critics say his brazen violation of Indian law was selfish and put the fragile tribe at risk \u2014 potentially exposing them to modern diseases for which they have no immunity.\n\nAn avid traveler who graduated from Oral Roberts University, Chau had visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands four times before and was awed by the area\u2019s natural beauty and isolation.\n\nOn the boat to North Sentinel Island \u2014 traveling at night to avoid detection by authorities \u2014 Chau wrote of seeing bioluminescent plankton under a canopy of stars as fish jumped in and out of the water like \u201cdarting mermaids.\u201d\n\nAfter paddling in a kayak to the island, Chau tried to engage the inhabitants by offering gifts of fish, scissors and safety pins and singing \u201cworship songs.\u201d A section of his diary is devoted to his impressions of the Sentinelese: He jotted down details of their language (\u201clots of high-pitched sounds\u201d) and gestures.\n\nToward the end of the journal, Chau wondered whether he should abandon his quest or return to the island and risk the consequences.\n\n\u201cI think I could be more useful alive . . . but to you, God, I give all the glory of whatever happens,\u201d Chau wrote.

(Andre Penner/Associated Press)\n\nSAO PAULO \u2014 Four years ago, then-Gremio coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was humiliated by his once-loving Palmeiras fans during a Brazilian league match.\n\nThey chanted \u201c7-1! 7-1! 7-1!\u201d during their 2-1 victory at Pacaembu Stadium, a reference to the hammering Big Phil took as Brazil coach in the 2014 World Cup semifinals against Germany five months earlier.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that Scolari had given the Sao Paulo club its only Copa Libertadores title in 1999. Or that he was the mastermind when Palmeiras won the 2012 Brazilian Cup unbeaten with one of their worst teams in recent history. The home humiliation with Brazil was too big of a stain to be erased so quickly.\n\nFast forward four years and once again the coach of Palmeiras, Scolari could win his first major title at home since the historic embarrassment against the Germans at the Mineirao Stadium. With a victory on Sunday at Vasco da Gama, one of the worst teams in the Brazilian league, Scolari will win his second trophy in the competition \u2014 22 years after the first.\n\nFew expected that when Scolari took over in July. Palmeiras was lagging in sixth place in the standings despite being the biggest spender in the country. Midfielder Lucas Lima, once courted by Barcelona, was not delivering. Former Alaves striker Deyverson was too undisciplined. The team\u2019s defense was unreliable.\n\nBut after a record 21-match unbeaten streak in the league, no one in Brazil doubts the former Chelsea manager anymore. Scolari\u2019s team now has 74 points, five ahead of Flamengo, with two matches to play.\n\n\u201cThere is no use in breaking records if we are not crowned champions,\u201d Scolari said Wednesday after a 4-0 win over America.\n\nAfter spending three years at Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande, the 70-year-old Scolari is once again revered as one of the best Brazilian coaches in the business. His attacking Palmeiras team is much more stylish than the stiff Brazil of four years ago and, most importantly, the 7-1 chants from opposing fans have disappeared.\n\nEven if the title doesn\u2019t come on Sunday, Palmeiras will still have another chance at home on Dec. 2 against Vitoria, which could be relegated by then.\n\nCHILEAN PROTEST\n\nChile midfielder Jean Beausejour used his national team jersey to make a point.\n\nThe 34-year-old player and his Chilean teammates wanted to honor a mapuche Indian named Camilo Catrillanca before their friendly match against Honduras. Catrillanca was killed by Chilean police in an incident that has shocked the South American country.\n\nThe president of the Chilean soccer association, however, denied the request of a minute\u2019s silence because Catrillanca did not have any sports links. So Beausejour wore his mapuche name of Coliqueo on his national team shirt.\n\nChile won the match 4-1.\n\nURUGUAYAN PROMISE\n\nTwo weeks after Penarol defended its Uruguayan title, there are still players fulfilling their promises and taking pictures to prove it.\n\nMidfielder Cristian Rodriguez climbed the Pan de Azucar, one of the highest points in the country at 389 meters. Midfielder Fabian Estoyanoff dyed his hair silver.\n\nRodriguez scored Penarol\u2019s winning goal in the victory over archrival Nacional on Nov. 11.\n\nPenarol has 52 Uruguayan titles while Nacional has 46.\n\nECUADORIAN ONIONS\n\nAmerica de Quito, the runner-up in the Ecuadorian league in 1969 and 1971, is back in the country\u2019s top division for the first time in 30 years.\n\nKnown as \u201cCebollitas,\u201d or the Little Onions, they were relegated in 1988 and had not returned until Wednesday\u2019s 4-0 win over Portoviejo.\n\nIn the last round of Ecuador\u2019s Serie B, America has a shot at winning the title.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Russia has strong military ties with western neighbor Belarus, which borders NATO members Poland and Lithuania, and the two allies held joint maneuvers amid tensions with the West.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump declared his intention last month to withdraw from the INF Treaty over alleged Russian violations. Moscow has denied breaching the pact and accused Washington of violating it.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said the INF Treaty and other arms control issues will likely top the agenda of his planned meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Argentina next week.\n\nOn Thursday, the Russian leader chaired a meeting on arms industries in Anapa in southern Russia that focused on production of ammunition for the military.\n\n\u201cWe need smart precision munitions that would increase the capability of both existing and prospective weapons,\u201d Putin said.\n\nThe INF Treaty, signed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, prohibited the U.S. and Russia from possessing, producing or test-flying ground-launched nuclear cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (300 to 3,400 miles.)\n\nSuch weapons were seen as particularly destabilizing since they take only a few minutes to reach their targets, leaving little time for political leaders to ponder a response and raising the threat of a nuclear war in case of an erroneous attack warning.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He reiterated that his own conclusion was that \u201cmaybe he did, maybe he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate the crime, I hate the coverup. I will tell you this: The crown prince hates it more than I do, and they have vehemently denied it,\u201d Trump said. Mohammed has not shown remorse for the killing, which was carried out by some of his close advisers.\n\nAsked who should be held accountable for the death of Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Turkey on Oct. 2, Trump again refused to place blame \u2014 instead espousing a grim view of the world that he often shares with advisers.\n\n\u201cMaybe the world should be held accountable because the world is a very, very vicious place,\u201d the president said.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., on Nov. 22. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nHe also seemed to suggest that all U.S. allies were guilty of the same behavior, declaring that if others were held to the standard to which critics have held Saudi Arabia in recent days, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be able to have anyone for an ally.\u201d\n\nTrump said \u201cnot at all\u201d when asked if he was concerned that his refusal to substantially punish Saudi Arabia would send a message to the rest of the world that people in power can do as they please.\n\nThe president has grown annoyed with the constant attention on the killing, advisers say, and sought to effectively close the matter Tuesday with an eight-paragraph, exclamation-mark-packed statement that smeared Khashoggi, questioned the CIA and praised Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrump\u2019s Thursday remarks came after he held a conference call with U.S. military officers overseas, during which he repeatedly praised his administration and sought to draw the officers into discussions of domestic policy. He asked military officials on several occasions to back him up on trade, immigration and other issues \u2014 and was sometimes rebuked by answers that did not square with his worldview.\n\nReturning to a recurrent pre-election theme, the president also warned the nation about threats he said were being posed by a caravan of people seeking eventual asylum in the United States.\n\nHe told reporters that he had shut down \u201cparts of the border\u201d because of \u201crioting on the other side\u201d and that he was prepared to do so again. It was not clear what the president meant \u2014 but it marked the first public reflection of a frequent private threat to close the border. Mexican officials have repeatedly complained about Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThey called me up, and I signed an order,\u201d said Trump, who declined when asked whether he would publicly release the document. Department of Homeland Security officials said Trump was referring to the temporary closure of an asylum crossing.\n\nHe also said that he had \u201cgiven the okay\u201d for U.S. troops to use lethal force against anyone crossing the border who represented a threat. U.S. military forces are typically not allowed to take such actions, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has already signaled his disinclination to change that policy. There has been considerable consternation in the administration about the policy, administration officials said.\n\nThe president\u2019s televised holiday phone call with U.S. military officers was meant to deflect criticism he has faced for not yet visiting a war zone, as previous presidents have done. Asked whether he would be traveling to visit soldiers, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do some interesting things at the appropriate time.\u201d He declined to give any further explanation.\n\nYet if the Thanksgiving morning activity was meant to allay one political firestorm, the president\u2019s remarks on Khashoggi only inflamed another.\n\nTime and again, the president has sided with Saudi officials and their explanations of the events leading to the killing, rather than with the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nHe sided anew against the CIA on Thursday, noting that in Saudi Arabia \u201cat the top level they say they did not commit this atrocity.\u201d\n\nAgain on Thursday, Trump indicated that the ally\u2019s economic contributions weighed on him more than the death of a U.S. resident.\n\n\u201cDo people really want me to give up hundreds of thousands of jobs?\u201d he asked when pressed about whether Saudi Arabia\u2019s actions deserved a stiffer penalty.\n\nAs he has before, he credited the nation for a drop in oil prices \u2014 while also crediting himself for \u201cjawboning\u201d Saudi Arabia \u2014 and said that a global depression could arise if the price of oil were to increase.\n\nHe alluded to the close relationship that Mohammed had forged with Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner over the course of the administration. The two have repeatedly talked as part of Kushner\u2019s Middle Eastern portfolio.\n\n\u201cTill this happened, there were a lot of people saying a lot of good things about the crown prince,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also continued for a second day his dispute with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. over the judgments of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which the president has regularly castigated.\n\nIn a rare public statement, Roberts on Wednesday defended the nation\u2019s judges, saying that an independent judiciary was critical to democracy.\n\nTrump opened Thanksgiving morning with tweets critical of the jurist.\n\n\u201cJustice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster. It is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country,\u201d he tweeted, repeating a falsehood he has often leveled at the court.\n\nTalking to reporters later, Trump said he liked and respected Roberts but added that \u201cI think we need to use some common sense.\u201d The president has often complained to advisers about the vote Roberts made to uphold a key portion of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe also escalated his criticism of the appellate court, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to stop that somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Trump said of judges stopping the desires of his administration."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "French priest, bishop convicted over sexual abuse of minors", "description": "A French priest has been sentenced to two years in prison for sexual abusing multiple children while his former bishop was convicted for failing to report the crimes", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/french-priest-bishop-convicted-over-sexual-abuse-of-minors/2018/11/22/bbcf5b4e-ee74-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:36:17Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "PARIS \u2014 A French priest has been sentenced to two years in prison for sexual abusing multiple children while his former bishop was convicted for failing to report the crimes.\n\nA court in the city of Orleans handed down the verdict Thursday against priest Pierre de Castelet and retired Orleans bishop Andre Fort.\n\nA court official said the ruling forbids De Castelet from working as a priest or meeting with minors, puts him on a national list of sex offenders and orders him to receive psychiatric treatment.\n\nFort was given an eight-month suspended sentence.

She died the previous week at a Dominican convent in Krakow. (Beata Zawrzel/Associated Press)\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 A Polish nun who was believed to be the oldest nun in the world and was recognized as a rescuer of Jews during the Holocaust was laid to rest on Thursday after dying last week at the age of 110.\n\nSister Cecylia Roszak was remembered as modest and merciful as nuns and other members of the church gathered in Krakow to bid her farewell.\n\nThe mother superior of her convent, Stanislawa Chruscicka, recalled in a phone interview with The Associated Press that Sister Cecylia would often comment that \u201clife is very beautiful but too short.\u201d\n\nBorn March 25, 1908, Roszak joined the convent at age 21. During the German occupation of Poland during World War II, when she was in her 30s, she was one of several nuns who set up a new convent near Vilnius, today in Lithuania, sheltering Jews who had escaped the ghetto there.\n\nIn 2009, when she was 101, Roszak and others from her convent were recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem Holocaust remembrance institute for saving several Jews, actions that put them at risk of being executed by the Germans.\n\nChruscicka said a huge bouquet at Thursday\u2019s funeral was sent by a woman, Wanda Jerzyniec, who, along with her brother, was sheltered by Sister Cecylia after the Germans shot both of their parents in Vilnius in 1944.\n\nChruscicka said the nuns learned about Jerzyniec earlier this year after Polish media wrote about Sister Cecylia on her 110th birthday. She said that Jerzyniec was too frail to attend the funeral.\n\nThe funeral Mass was held at the Dominican nuns\u2019 church in Krakow and Roszak was then buried at the city\u2019s historic Rakowicki cemetery.\n\nFather Pawel Rytel-Andrianik, spokesman for Poland\u2019s Roman Catholic Church, described her as \u201cprobably the oldest nun in the world,\u201d though Chruscicka said she was certain that Roszak was the oldest.\n\n___\n\nVanessa Gera in Warsaw contributed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He reiterated that his own conclusion was that \u201cmaybe he did, maybe he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate the crime, I hate the coverup. I will tell you this: The crown prince hates it more than I do, and they have vehemently denied it,\u201d Trump said. Mohammed has not shown remorse for the killing, which was carried out by some of his close advisers.\n\nAsked who should be held accountable for the death of Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Turkey on Oct. 2, Trump again refused to place blame \u2014 instead espousing a grim view of the world that he often shares with advisers.\n\n\u201cMaybe the world should be held accountable because the world is a very, very vicious place,\u201d the president said.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., on Nov. 22. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nHe also seemed to suggest that all U.S. allies were guilty of the same behavior, declaring that if others were held to the standard to which critics have held Saudi Arabia in recent days, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be able to have anyone for an ally.\u201d\n\nTrump said \u201cnot at all\u201d when asked if he was concerned that his refusal to substantially punish Saudi Arabia would send a message to the rest of the world that people in power can do as they please.\n\nThe president has grown annoyed with the constant attention on the killing, advisers say, and sought to effectively close the matter Tuesday with an eight-paragraph, exclamation-mark-packed statement that smeared Khashoggi, questioned the CIA and praised Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrump\u2019s Thursday remarks came after he held a conference call with U.S. military officers overseas, during which he repeatedly praised his administration and sought to draw the officers into discussions of domestic policy. He asked military officials on several occasions to back him up on trade, immigration and other issues \u2014 and was sometimes rebuked by answers that did not square with his worldview.\n\nReturning to a recurrent pre-election theme, the president also warned the nation about threats he said were being posed by a caravan of people seeking eventual asylum in the United States.\n\nHe told reporters that he had shut down \u201cparts of the border\u201d because of \u201crioting on the other side\u201d and that he was prepared to do so again. It was not clear what the president meant \u2014 but it marked the first public reflection of a frequent private threat to close the border. Mexican officials have repeatedly complained about Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThey called me up, and I signed an order,\u201d said Trump, who declined when asked whether he would publicly release the document. Department of Homeland Security officials said Trump was referring to the temporary closure of an asylum crossing.\n\nHe also said that he had \u201cgiven the okay\u201d for U.S. troops to use lethal force against anyone crossing the border who represented a threat. U.S. military forces are typically not allowed to take such actions, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has already signaled his disinclination to change that policy. There has been considerable consternation in the administration about the policy, administration officials said.\n\nThe president\u2019s televised holiday phone call with U.S. military officers was meant to deflect criticism he has faced for not yet visiting a war zone, as previous presidents have done. Asked whether he would be traveling to visit soldiers, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do some interesting things at the appropriate time.\u201d He declined to give any further explanation.\n\nYet if the Thanksgiving morning activity was meant to allay one political firestorm, the president\u2019s remarks on Khashoggi only inflamed another.\n\nTime and again, the president has sided with Saudi officials and their explanations of the events leading to the killing, rather than with the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nHe sided anew against the CIA on Thursday, noting that in Saudi Arabia \u201cat the top level they say they did not commit this atrocity.\u201d\n\nAgain on Thursday, Trump indicated that the ally\u2019s economic contributions weighed on him more than the death of a U.S. resident.\n\n\u201cDo people really want me to give up hundreds of thousands of jobs?\u201d he asked when pressed about whether Saudi Arabia\u2019s actions deserved a stiffer penalty.\n\nAs he has before, he credited the nation for a drop in oil prices \u2014 while also crediting himself for \u201cjawboning\u201d Saudi Arabia \u2014 and said that a global depression could arise if the price of oil were to increase.\n\nHe alluded to the close relationship that Mohammed had forged with Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner over the course of the administration. The two have repeatedly talked as part of Kushner\u2019s Middle Eastern portfolio.\n\n\u201cTill this happened, there were a lot of people saying a lot of good things about the crown prince,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also continued for a second day his dispute with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. over the judgments of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which the president has regularly castigated.\n\nIn a rare public statement, Roberts on Wednesday defended the nation\u2019s judges, saying that an independent judiciary was critical to democracy.\n\nTrump opened Thanksgiving morning with tweets critical of the jurist.\n\n\u201cJustice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster. It is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country,\u201d he tweeted, repeating a falsehood he has often leveled at the court.\n\nTalking to reporters later, Trump said he liked and respected Roberts but added that \u201cI think we need to use some common sense.\u201d The president has often complained to advisers about the vote Roberts made to uphold a key portion of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe also escalated his criticism of the appellate court, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to stop that somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Trump said of judges stopping the desires of his administration."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CindyBoren, http://www.facebook.com/des.bieler", "title": "The Match: Everything you need to know about Tiger Woods vs. Phil Mickelson - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post The Match: Everything you need to know about Tiger Woods vs. Phil Mickelson Washington Post On Friday, either Phil Mickelson or Tiger Woods will see his riches grow from the outrageous to the obscene, thanks to The Match, the long-ballyhooed, \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/22/match-everything-you-need-know-about-tiger-woods-vs-phil-mickelson/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Pd5oaBgFdG0iUDiurdQDNdTvsg0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EZXPHSRXSAI6RLZ4EERXCX3Y34.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:01:03Z", "content": "On Friday, either Phil Mickelson or Tiger Woods will see his riches grow from the outrageous to the obscene, thanks to The Match, the long-ballyhooed, $9 million, winner-take-all, 18-hole match between two golfers who havent always been the best of buddies.

That led to some headlines earlier this week when the longtime rivals wagered $200,000 on the first hole.\n\n[Let the side bets begin: Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods wager $200,000 on The Match\u2019s first hole]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to risk $100,000 that says I birdie the first hole,\u201d Mickelson said during a joint news conference. \u201cSo that\u2019s how good I feel heading into this match. You don\u2019t have to take it, but I\u2019m going to throw that out there.\u201d\n\n\"So you think you can make birdie on the first hole,\u201d Woods said, to which Mickelson replied, \u201cI know I\u2019m going to make birdie on the first hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cDouble it,\u201d Woods answered.\n\nThe event has drawn criticism from some corners, including from pro golfers like Rory McIlroy, who said he\u2019s not going to watch it.\n\n\u201cLook, if they had a done it 15 years ago it would have been great,\u201d McIlroy said earlier this month. \u201cBut nowadays, it\u2019s missed the mark a little bit.\u201d\n\nDenis Pugh, who coaches British Open champion Francesco Molinari, called The Match \u201ca hyped-up sideshow,\u201d while European PGA golfer Eddie Pepperell dubbed it \u201cputrid\u201d and \u201cpathetic.\u201d\n\nWriting Friday in the New York Times, Karen Crouse argued that Woods and Mickelson could have better furthered their stated goal \u2014 expanding golf\u2019s audience \u2014 by pairing off with female professionals. Earlier this century, Woods and Annika Sorenstam defeated David Duval and Karrie Webb in 19 holes in an alternate-shot match that was televised in prime time.\n\n\u201cThe LPGA\u2019s current players possess both the game and the gregariousness to sell themselves to a wider audience,\u201d Crouse wrote. \u201cAll they\u2019re missing is a stage big enough to accommodate their personalities.\u201d\n\nWoods and Mickelson, in any case, have done their part to sell the rivalry.\n\n\u201cCan you get in Phil Mickelson\u2019s head,\u201d Woods was asked this month.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been in Phil\u2019s head for 20-some-odd years,\u201d Woods replied with a laugh. \u201cJust look at the W total.\u201d\n\nTiger Woods is a savage. RIP Phil. pic.twitter.com/pMqzvGOTl7 \u2014 Shooter McGavin (@ShooterMcGavin_) November 17, 2018\n\nWhat: An 18-hole, winner-take-all, $9 million, mano-a-mano match-play event between two of golf\u2019s aging yet most ferocious competitors.\n\nWhen: Friday, 3 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWhere: Shadow Creek Golf Course, about 15 miles north of the Las Vegas Strip. In 2004, Woods carded a course-record 60 at Shadow Creek, but the course has since been renovated.\n\nHow to watch: The match is available on a pay-per-view basis via the major cable and satellite providers. For $19.99, live stream the match through Turner\u2019s streaming platform B/R Live and AT&T\u2019s DirecTV and U-verse. For $30, there\u2019s a 4K HDR broadcast through AT&T. There\u2019s no public access to the event, but VIPs will be invited by the MGM Resorts, which runs Shadow Creek. There also will be a pro-am for a select group.\n\nI bet you think this is the easiest $9M you will ever make\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Phil Mickelson (@PhilMickelson) August 22, 2018\n\nThe announcers: Turner Sports veteran Ernie Johnson will provide the play-by-play, and Peter Jacobsen and Darren Clarke will be the color commentators. Charles Barkley, known for the atrocity that is his golf swing, and actor Samuel L. Jackson will be special guests during the pre-match coverage and during the actual competition.\n\nWhy they\u2019re playing: These two gentlemen have had a famously frosty relationship over the years. They\u2019ve mellowed, they love to gamble and . . . did we mention the $9 million (plus those side bets and other wagers)? \u201cWe\u2019re going to have little challenges that can maybe get in each others' heads,\u201d Mickelson said during a TNT interview. \u201cYou have a downhill putt? I\u2019ll bet you 50 Gs that you miss it.\u201d Both players plan to donate some of the proceeds to charity, with Mickelson selecting the Children of the 58 Fund and the Las Vegas Shriners and Woods picking his own foundation and other charities.\n\nWhy you should watch: The golfers, according to Golf.com, will be mic\u2019d up, as will their caddies, so put earmuffs on the kiddos and enjoy.\n\nThe weather: The forecast in Las Vegas calls for sunny skies and a high of 65 degrees, with winds 5-10 mph.\n\nThe odds: Earlier this week, bookmakers had installed Woods as a -220 favorite to win (in other words, you have to bet $220 to win $100), though that number had dropped to -190 at Bovada by Friday morning. Mickelson was listed as a +180 underdog (bet $100 to win $180) early in the week, but that also has come down to +150 at Bovada.\n\n\u201cThe current betting is 73 percent of the tickets and 62 percent of money bet on Phil,\u201d Jeff Sherman, senior vice president of risk management at the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas, told the New York Post. \u201cIt isn\u2019t surprising to see this split considering neither player really comes into this event in any form. Woods has not played since the Ryder Cup and Mickelson has played once.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the price. People would rather bet $100 to win $175 on Phil than lay $200 to win $100,\u201d Nick Bogdanovich, director of trading at William Hill US, told the New York Post. He added that the betting at his shop is a little closer to 50/50.\n\nBovada has listed a number of other ways to wager on the match (all odds as of early Friday morning):\n\nWinning margin\n\nWoods by 2 or more: -110\n\nWoods by 3 or more: +175\n\nWoods by 4 or more: +350\n\nWoods by 5 or more: +800\n\nMickelson by 2 or more: +275\n\nMickelson by 3 or more: +450\n\nMickelson by 4 or more: +800\n\nMickelson by 5 or more: +2000\n\nWill there be a hole-in-one?\n\nYes +5000\n\nWill Mickelson card an eagle?\n\nYes +500\n\nWill Woods card an eagle?\n\nYes +350\n\nWill Mickelson win the first, second and third holes?\n\nYes +2500\n\nWill Woods win the first, second and third holes?\n\nYes +2000\n\nWho will take the first lead?\n\nWoods -135\n\nMickelson +105\n\nWho will be the first to go 2 up?\n\nWoods -155\n\nMickelson +120\n\nWill either player hit a shot into a water hazard?\n\nYes +175\n\nNo -230\n\nWill either player hit a shot out of bounds?\n\nYes +325\n\nNo -500\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAaron Rodgers donates $1 million to California wildfire recovery\n\nUFC fighter reportedly files for restraining order after alleged domestic assault\n\nThrough 11 weeks of the NFL season, Drew Brees is the clear-cut MVP\n\nJared Jeffries was a rising NBA executive, then he decided to embrace esports"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CindyBoren", "title": "Thanksgiving NFL schedule: Bears' Mitchell Trubisky is out; Chase Daniel will start - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Thanksgiving NFL schedule: Bears' Mitchell Trubisky is out; Chase Daniel will start Washington Post Thanksgiving Day brings us the usual trio of NFL games, with all three having postseason implications and two of them involving backup quarterb\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/22/nfl-thanksgiving-day-tv-schedule/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FhZ4sOztXmx5DzcfzGiKTONSaBI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRUB4WW3JQI6RC5MX7QB7TODUY.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:51:59Z", "content": "Thanksgiving Day brings us the usual trio of NFL games, with all three having postseason implications and two of them involving backup quarterbacks thrust into starting roles by injury.

Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nFalcons at Saints\n\nTime: 8:20 p.m. Eastern\n\nTV: NBC.\n\nSpread (as of Thursday morning): New Orleans -12.5.\n\nThe Chiefs and Rams have been getting all the attention because of their touchdown-laden shootout Monday night, but are enough people talking about just how silly the Saints have gotten? They haven\u2019t lost since a season-opening defeat to the Bucs (back when the Bucs were actually a thing and not the mess they currently are) and have won their past four games by an average of 24.5 points \u2014 one of them a 10-point victory over the Rams.\n\nNew Orleans already has a six-point overtime win over Atlanta, and that one came without running back Mark Ingram, who was serving a season-opening four-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. Ingram has rushed for at least 100 yards in consecutive games and now he and Alvin Kamara get a Falcons defense that has allowed 13 rushing touchdowns (only the Bucs and Browns have allowed more) and 11 rushing plays of at least 20 yards (only the Jets, Cardinals and Dolphins have allowed more).\n\nThe Falcons\u2019 season seems to be slipping away at 4-6, and games against the Ravens and Packers follow Thursday night\u2019s tough one in New Orleans.\n\nRedskins at Cowboys\n\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern.\n\nTV: Fox.\n\nSpread (as of Thursday morning): Dallas -7.\n\nColt McCoy gets the call at quarterback for the Redskins after Alex Smith\u2019s gruesome leg injury Sunday against the Texans, and he has a short week to get up to speed. McCoy is just 7-18 as a starter, though 21 of those games came with the Browns in 2010 and 2011, his first two NFL seasons (he went 1-3 as a starter for the Redskins in 2014, with the one win coming in Dallas).\n\nMcCoy couldn\u2019t be much worse in the long-passing-play department than his predecessor: With Smith under center, the Redskins had just four passing plays that went for at least 40 yards this season, and none since Week 4 against the Saints. The Cowboys have allowed only four such passing plays this season (only three teams have allowed fewer) and have given up a league-low 13 passing touchdowns (tied with the Cardinals and Vikings). Washington also converted only 9 of 54 attempts on third-and-nine or longer with Smith at quarterback.\n\n[Five keys to the Redskins-Cowboys game]\n\nThe Cowboys seem to have righted the ship with two straight wins, perhaps ending (for now) any talk about Coach Jason Garrett\u2019s future with the team. They would move into a first-place NFC East tie with the Redskins with a victory, which also would even the season series at one game apiece. Like Washington, Dallas isn\u2019t all that explosive in the passing department: It, too, has just four passing plays of at least 40 yards. But the Cowboys have started to lean more on running back Ezekiel Elliott, and it\u2019s paid off. He has 273 rushing yards and two scores while also catching 15 passes out of the backfield over the past two games.\n\nBears 23, Lions 16\n\nSpread (as of Thursday morning): Chicago -3.\n\nThe Bears had about as short a week of preparation as you can get in the NFL \u2014 85 hours \u2014 after being flexed into Sunday night\u2019s game against the Vikings and getting Thursday\u2019s early time slot.\n\nTeams facing similar Sunday night-Thanksgiving afternoon turnarounds have not fared all that well, but the Bears came away with a 23-16 victory, thanks to their defense.\n\nWith Detroit falling to 4-7, Chicago moved to 8-3 and now catches a break. Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky was sidelined by a shoulder injury he suffered against Minnesota and should be ready to play Dec. 2 against the Giants. In his place, Chase Daniel made the third start of his nine-season career, and the first since 2014. Even Daniel admitted, \u201cJeez, that was a long time ago.\u201d But don\u2019t fret too much over his career. He\u2019s made more than $28 million as a backup (the best job in sports).\n\n[Five keys to the Redskins-Cowboys game]\n\nDaniel completed 27 of 37 passes for 230 yards and two touchdowns, helped greatly by playing for three seasons under Nagy in Kansas City.

(Wayne Parry/Associated Press)\n\nMAURICE RIVER TOWNSHIP, N.J. \u2014 Rising seas and erosion are threatening lighthouses around the U.S. and the world. Volunteers and cash-strapped governments are doing what they can, but the level of concern, like the water, is rising.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s East Point Lighthouse has been lighting up Delaware Bay for the better part of two centuries. But those same waters that the lighthouse helped illuminate might bring about its demise.\n\nWith even a moderate-term fix likely to cost $3 million or more, New Jersey officials are considering what to do to save the lighthouse. Nancy Patterson, president of the Maurice River Historical Society, says something needs to be done now.\n\nState and local governments routinely shore up the perimeter of the lighthouse property with 3,000-pound (1360-kilogram) sand bags and hastily bulldozed earthen walls. During normal conditions, the bay is about 40 yards (37 meters) from the lighthouse; aerial photos from 1940 show at least four times as much beach between the lighthouse and the bay as there is now.\n\nAnd during storms, the surf pounds against an earthen wall just 10 yards (9 meters) from the lighthouse\u2019s front steps.\n\n\u201cThis lighthouse is in incredible danger; it\u2019s getting worse and worse and worse,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cThe water is right there, often within feet of the lighthouse.\u201d\n\nShe recently led a save-the-lighthouse rally to call attention to its plight and push the state Department of Environmental Protection to do something to save it before it falls into the bay.\n\nIt\u2019s a threat affecting lighthouses around the country and the world, including those in low-lying areas being inundated by water, as well as those on bluffs or cliffs being eroded by storms and rising sea levels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening faster than anybody had predicted,\u201d said Jeff Gales, executive director of the U.S. Lighthouse Society in Hansville, Washington.\n\nWhile some of the lighthouses continue to be relied upon for navigation, others have been supplanted more modern technology, and are treasured more for historical and tourism purposes.\n\nClimate change hastened by manmade greenhouse gases is not only melting polar ice, adding to sea levels, but the warmer waters are expanding and some land formations sinking.\n\nGlobally, sea levels have been rising over the past century, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the rate has increased in recent decades. In New Jersey, seas have risen by 1.3 feet (0.4 meters) over the past 100 years, said Benjamin Horton, a Rutgers University professor and leading expert on climate change and sea level rise. That is a faster pace than for the past 2,000 years combined, he said.\n\nHorton and other Rutgers researchers project that by 2050, seas off New Jersey will rise by an additional 1.4 feet (0.4 meters).\n\nTim Harrison is the editor of Lighthouse Digest, a Maine-based publication that maintains a \u201cDoomsday List\u201d of 53 lighthouses around the U.S. deemed to be in danger of being lost due to storms, erosion or other causes.\n\n\u201cLighthouses were built for one purpose: to save lives,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn to step up save these lighthouses.\u201d\n\nRising seas have already forced the relocation of several lighthouses. In 1999, the National Park Service moved the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in Buxton, North Carolina, 2,900 feet inland, at a cost of $11.8 million. In 1993, the Southeast Lighthouse on Block Island, Rhode Island, was moved 300 feet inland.\n\nIn 2014 the Cape San Blas Lighthouse was moved from the edge of a storm-prone peninsula on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast to a park in Port St. Joe. A year later, the Gay Head Lighthouse on Massachusetts\u2019 Martha\u2019s Vineyard was moved 129 feet back from an eroding cliff.\n\nOthers were not so lucky. The Galveston Jetty Lighthouse in Texas and the Sabine Bank Lighthouse in Louisiana were lost to storms or rising seas, and the Kauhola Point Lighthouse on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island was demolished after erosion nearby was deemed too severe to save it, Harrison said.\n\nLighthouses around the country considered to be in danger from rising seas include the Sand Island Lighthouse at the mouth of Mobile Bay in Alabama, the Morris Island Lighthouse near Charleston, South Carolina, and the New Point Comfort Lighthouse in Virginia.\n\nAround the world, encroaching seas are drawing nearer to the Orfordness Lighthouse in Suffolk, England; the Troubridge Island Lighthouse in South Australia; and the Kiipsaar Lighthouse in Estonia. In 2010, the Half Moon Caye Lighthouse in Belize was destroyed by a storm.\n\nThere are few easy answers, financially or scientifically. The East Point Lighthouse is already on the highest spit of land around, which is only a few inches above sea level, so moving it is not an option. Nor is constantly dumping and plowing more sand in front of it.\n\nPatterson wants some sort of bulkhead or barrier erected between the bay and the lighthouse to blunt the force of the waves.\n\nLarry Hajna, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, acknowledges the lighthouse has been \u201cvery vulnerable to storms due to erosion\u201d for years. And he realizes the sandbags the state and local governments keep plopping on the shoreline are a stop-gap measure at best.\n\nBut while affirming the state\u2019s interest in saving the lighthouse, he notes that moving or protecting it with rock-filled cages could cost several million dollars.\n\nBecause of the high cost of moving or protecting the lighthouses, volunteer preservation groups often partner with governments to maintain them; one has spent at least $5 million on the Morris Island Lighthouse in South Carolina. And cash-strapped governments often can\u2019t spare funds to save lighthouses.\n\nPatterson, the New Jersey lighthouse advocate, says a barrier needs to be built near the East Point Lighthouse immediately.\n\n\u201cThis history matters,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to do something \u2014 now \u2014 while there\u2019s still something to save.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that photos from 1940 were aerial photos, not satellite photos.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The New Yorker had also called her \u201caloof, frenetic, and misguided\u201d earlier this year.\n\nBut Pelosi ignored all that.\n\nInstead, the veteran House Democratic leader went about winning over Higgins this week, listening to the Buffalo lawmaker\u2019s grievances and enlisting allies to convince him that he would see progress on legislation to expand Medicare.\n\nThe strategy worked: On Wednesday, Higgins pulled his name off the anti-Pelosi letter and threw his support behind the 78-year-old leader \u2014 moving her closer to reclaiming the gavel she first won more than a decade ago.\n\nPelosi\u2019s relentless honey-over-vinegar approach to dealing with political headaches \u2014 which she learned at the foot of her father, former Baltimore mayor Thomas D\u2019Alesandro Jr. \u2014 has been critical to sustaining her grip on power since Democrats won the House majority this month.\n\nShe has personally courted disgruntled members in meetings and by phone while deploying her sprawling network to bolster her bid among both liberals and moderates, all but overwhelming her critics with her ability to outmaneuver them.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doesn\u2019t raise her voice; she doesn\u2019t threaten anybody \u2014 that\u2019s not her style,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Pelosi ally. \u201cShe wins by winning the moral argument, by winning the public-relations argument, by winning the argument with groups and activists. She\u2019s going to be speaker.\u201d\n\n[Pelosi sidelines challenger, wins praise from Obama amid speakership fight]\n\nAccording to several aides involved in their discussions, Pelosi\u2019s tenacity has rattled and weakened the ragtag group of rebel Democrats, mostly men, who have struggled to recruit a challenger.\n\nBut she has not yet shuttered their revolt. For now, they might have the numbers to prevent her from winning the floor vote in January \u2014 15 Democrats remain on the letter, at least four more Democrats have said they will oppose her, and dozens more are publicly undecided.\n\nDepending on the outcome of several uncalled races, Pelosi could potentially weather as many as 17 defections on the floor.\n\n\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) is questioned on Nov. 15 by reporters about his opposition to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) becoming House speaker. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nStill, the momentum is clearly with Pelosi. One potential challenger, Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), dropped her plans Tuesday. And two leaders of the opposition, Reps. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) and Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), have found themselves under intense scrutiny by Pelosi supporters accusing them of sexism or disloyalty for pursuing a coup so soon after Democrats\u2019 sweeping gains in the midterms.\n\nAt the moment, no potential Pelosi challenger is even close to preparing to jump into the race and champion their cause, according to Democrats involved in those talks.\n\nDespite her reputation for political hardball, Pelosi has made advances over the past two weeks without resorting to overt threats, according to interviews with more than a dozen aides and members familiar with her efforts. The approach throughout has been purely transactional, rooted in her Little Italy upbringing \u2014 what she called \u201cthe D\u2019Alesandro model\u201d in her 2008 book, \u201cKnow Your Power.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to know how to count the votes, to anticipate how many people will vote for you,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd in order to turn out those votes, you have to be organized on every level.\u201d\n\nPelosi has been in listening mode since Democrats won the House in the Nov. 6 midterms, building a majority that could reach 235 seats. Last week, she conducted a blitz of the major party constituencies \u2014 groups such as the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Black Caucus, among others. Her allies, who include the incoming chairs of every major House committee, have fanned out to solidify her support and discourage her opponents.\n\n[New York congressman who signed letter against Pelosi now says he\u2019ll support her]\n\nRep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.), a leader of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition who has voted against Pelosi in the past, said he has taken calls from House colleagues, senators and home-state bigwigs all urging him to get on board. He described a polite, professional meeting last week with Pelosi during which she made no threats but also gave no ground.\n\nThe Blue Dogs, like other factions inside the party, have been frustrated that Pelosi has shown little sign of relinquishing power after 16 years and making way for younger leaders. Pelosi has spoken of being a \u201ctransitional\u201d speaker but has resisted making any firm retirement plan.\n\n\u201cI told Nancy last week, \u2018None of us are getting any younger,\u2019 \u201d Costa recalled Tuesday. \u201cShe smiled, and she says, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s true. None of us are getting any younger.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn another sign that Pelosi\u2019s potential opposition is softening, a group that threatened to withhold its votes if it doesn\u2019t get a set of House process reforms has started talking about accepting a partial victory and moving on.\n\nThe bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus had called for a significant changes that would curb the power of the majority party\u2019s leadership, including requiring floor votes on certain bipartisan bills and opening up the amendment process.\n\nPelosi last week unveiled proposed reforms that incorporated some of the group\u2019s more modest suggestions but did not include several of its more ambitious demands.\n\nOn a conference call Monday, the Democratic members of the group discussed what sort of compromise they could accept, and co-chairman Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) has been negotiating with Pelosi since then in hopes of reaching a deal.\n\nThere were plenty of other signs this week that her opposition is fizzling. Former president Barack Obama offered effusive praise of Pelosi on Tuesday, while Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel \u2014 who sparred with Pelosi while serving as Obama\u2019s chief of staff \u2014 endorsed her Wednesday.\n\nRep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), a young and influential liberal who has challenged the party\u2019s establishment, has trained her fire on Pelosi\u2019s critics: \u201cSo long as Leader Pelosi remains the most progressive candidate for Speaker, she can count on my support,\u201d she tweeted Wednesday.\n\n[Fight for House speaker explodes into a national political campaign]\n\nMeanwhile, down the Democratic leadership ballot, what could have been a messy free-for-all is looking more like a coronation: Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) remains unopposed for majority leader. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) dropped a challenge to Pelosi\u2019s preferred whip candidate, Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), on Monday. And Pelosi maneuvered to secure the No. 4 spot for Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-N.M.) by creating a new junior leadership post for his challenger, Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.).\n\nFormer Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) said Pelosi has a savvy understanding of what it takes to win high-stakes leadership elections, especially in an era in which institutional power is diminished.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Sam Rayburn\u2019s Congress, where speakers could personally and institutionally intimidate people,\u201d he said, referring to the Texas Democrat who was the longest-serving House speaker. \u201cShe is doing exactly what she needs to do, whether it\u2019s inventing 16 meaningless titles so everybody can get something, or when people ask for a seat at the table, just building a bigger table.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no move was so crippling to her opponents as the deal she struck with Fudge, a blunt former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus who had allied herself with Moulton and Ryan and openly pondered running against Pelosi.\n\nFudge said in an interview a week ago that she was not interested in a deal and questioned Pelosi\u2019s commitment to diversity. \u201cNobody wants the status quo,\u201d she said.\n\nThe next day, Fudge spent 40 minutes in Pelosi\u2019s office in a meeting brokered by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), a respected elder statesman close to both women. When Fudge emerged, her remarks had lost their edge.\n\nShe told reporters that Pelosi was a \u201cvery, very good leader\u201d and said the conversation \u201cwent a long way in trying to find some way that we can unify this caucus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the leader had to do was explain that she\u2019d need to raise $135 million in a presidential cycle, which would require being on the road every day you\u2019re not in session,\u201d said former congresswoman Donna F. Edwards, a former Congressional Black Caucus member who has spoken out on Pelosi\u2019s behalf in recent days. \u201cYou\u2019d also need to pass a legislative agenda that makes sure everyone\u2019s priorities are met so they can run on something for reelection. And you\u2019re going to have to negotiate with [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell in the Senate.\u201d\n\nFudge folded Tuesday, agreeing to back Pelosi after securing a verbal commitment to give African American women a more prominent role in leadership decision-making and to award her the chairmanship of a subcommittee on elections \u2014 a post that stands to give Fudge a unique pulpit on voting rights issues.\n\nHiggins underwent a similar transformation. In an interview last week, he said Pelosi was \u201cendangering our majority\u201d by holding on to power and that a suitable alternative would emerge if she couldn\u2019t win the necessary votes. But on Wednesday, Higgins said someone who won the speakership under those circumstances would be \u201cundeserving.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to be speaker, you\u2019ve got to stand up and you\u2019ve got to fight for it \u2014 period, the end,\u201d he said.\n\nHiggins said assurances of a \u201cserious good-faith effort\u201d to advance legislation allowing Americans as young as 50 to purchase Medicare coverage helped persuade him, as well as a renewed commitment to a vast infrastructure spending bill. The deal, he said, was brokered over four days of phone calls with not only Pelosi, but also with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Richard E.

Post contributor Pat Padua gave the flick three stars: \u201cThis endearing update of a holiday classic reminds us that the Christmas season can be hard for the lonely.

The movie is punctuated by moments of pitiless, horrifying savagery, and one genuinely breathtaking plot twist.

The Danish and Finnish announcements come the same week President Trump backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite the CIA assessing that he ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nDenmark\u2019s ban includes goods that can be used both for military and civilian purposes but is still less expansive than the German measures, which also included sales that had already been approved.\n\nWhile the Nordic countries are tiny arms equipment exporters in comparison with bigger players such as the United States, Britain or France, their decision will probably exacerbate concerns within the European arms industry of a growing anti-Saudi consensus in the European Union and beyond.\n\nEven though Trump has suggested that he will put Saudi investments and arms exports revenue above human rights concerns, lawmakers across the political spectrum and on both sides of the Atlantic have grown increasingly alarmed.\n\nApart from the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October, a Saudi-led coalition has been accused of numerous human rights violations in Yemen since 2015. On Wednesday, international humanitarian organization Save the Children said that 85,000 children had starved to death there since the beginning of the intervention.\n\n[85,000 children have starved to death during the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, says new report]\n\nSpeaking on Danish television Thursday, Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, Anders Samuelsen, confirmed that the \u201ccontinued worsening of the already terrible situation in Yemen and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u201d had led to the exports ban. He urged other E.U. members to also reevaluate their stances.\n\nOn Thursday, Finland also stopped arms equipment exports to the United Arab Emirates, which is part of the Saudi-led coalition intervening in Yemen. In its announcement, the Finnish government explicitly cited the \u201calarming humanitarian situation in Yemen.\u201d\n\nWhile Denmark, Finland and Germany are being celebrated by human rights advocates for following through on their threats to halt sales to the kingdom, bigger arms exporters have pointed out that the two nations have far less to lose domestically than others. And Germany has in the past shown that it is willing to break its own promises whenever pressure by human rights groups drops. After the current government vowed to halt all arms sales earlier this year, it approved new sales months later \u2014 only to halt them once again after the Khashoggi killing.\n\nDenmark\u2019s center-right government similarly faced criticism last year after it was reported that it had approved the sale of sensitive surveillance technology to Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia. The technology was produced by a Danish subsidiary of Britain\u2019s weapons company BAE Systems, but its sale was approved by authorities in Copenhagen in 2016.\n\nThe export licenses were granted after Saudi officials maintained that the technology was supposed to be used only against criminal activity and terrorism.\n\nBut human rights groups feared that the software would almost certainly also be used by Saudi officials to spy on critics \u2014 a concern that turned out to be justified in the wake of the Khashoggi killing, after reports emerged that critics of the Saudi leadership had been monitored online. It\u2019s unclear whether the same Danish technology was being used.\n\nTo giant weapons producers, the mounting resistance against arms sales to Saudi Arabia may pose challenges even if Britain, France and the United States refrain from imposing export bans. British and French producers import a number of components needed to assemble fighter jets or tanks from other E.U. countries, including Denmark and Germany, with the latter still being home to one of the world\u2019s largest arms manufacturing industries.\n\nIf lawmakers in Germany, Finland or Denmark were to adopt an even more comprehensive definition of a Saudi sales ban, their decision may also disrupt supply chains in Britain and France, companies there fear.\n\nMore on WorldViews:\n\n\u2018God, I don\u2019t want to die,\u2019 U.S. missionary wrote before he was killed by remote tribe on Indian island\n\nWhat Trump got wrong about Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in global oil markets\n\n85,000 children have starved to death during the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, says new report"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Kenya holds locals for questioning over Italian's abduction", "description": "Kenya holding locals who might have 'good information' on Italian's abduction", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/kenya-holds-locals-for-questioning-over-italians-abduction/2018/11/22/07d20a2e-ee5b-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T13:32:19Z", "content": "KAMPALA, Uganda A Kenyan police official says authorities are questioning several people who could have good information leading to the arrest of the gunmen who abducted an Italian woman in a coastal town.

Losers of six straight and seven of their last eight games, Jacksonville squandered a 16-0 lead with 17 minutes left in the game before losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers 20-16 last week. And a large part of their struggles can be traced to a lack of variation in their play calling.\n\nFor example, Warren Sharp of Sharp Sports notes that on the four drives following their 16-0 lead, the Jaguars lined up in a one wide receiver set from under center and ran a rushing play behind the center on every first down, eventually going three-and-out on each drive. That\u2019s in addition to running 17 rushing plays behind the center when leading in the second half this season.\n\nOn the season, this is the creativity the Jaguars offense has shown when rushing with a lead in the 2nd half. It's obviously terrible. But it's even worse to think you'll be able to do the same thing, but this time have success against the Steelers with a backup center. pic.twitter.com/8sFC8kbyrX \u2014 Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) November 21, 2018\n\nIf the public can see these tendencies, you can bet Buffalo, a team that boasts the second-best defense in 2018 per Football Outsiders, will too.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (-3) at Denver Broncos\n\nPick: Pittsburgh Steelers -3\n\nBroncos quarterback Case Keenum isn\u2019t playing well enough to put your faith in his squad. The 30-year-old journeyman is completing 63 percent of his passes for 2,605 yards with almost as many interceptions (10) as touchdowns (11). ESPN places him 28th in Total Quarterback Rating, estimating his production this season is good enough to win seven games out of a 16-game season (44.6 QBR). Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, by comparison, ranks 8th in QBR (69.3).\n\nDenver\u2019s rushing attack is good, but the team needs to lead for it to be the focal point and, as three-point underdogs, that\u2019s less likely to happen. This season the Broncos run the ball 56 percent of the time when leading but just 31 percent of the time while trailing, indicating Keenum is going to have to pass the ball more often to catch up.\n\n***\n\nThe two games above represent my best plays of the week because my analysis shows the point spreads are divergent from what I expect to happen once the teams take the field. One reason the house wins so often is because bettors try to make too many plays when the odds aren\u2019t in their favor. This makes trying to pick every single NFL game something of a fool\u2019s errand. The odds should be in my favor in the games above, which is why I think they\u2019re worth a bet.

On the streets and at the restaurant everyone keeps on stopping me asking me to beat \u2018la Samp.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor this week, at least, people in Genoa have something else to discuss besides the bridge collapse.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/asdampf\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Costa hasn\u2019t scored in the Spanish league this season, and he will be under even more pressure to end that slump when Atletico Madrid hosts Barcelona on Saturday Nov. 24, 2018 with the Liga lead on the line. (Matt Dunham, File/Associated Press)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 With his imposing frame, aggressive attitude and talent for scoring difficult goals, Diego Costa has rightfully earned his reputation as a terror for defenders.\n\nBut that status is in serious danger after a scoring drought in the Spanish league that dates back to February.\n\nThe 30-year-old Costa hasn\u2019t scored in nine appearances for Atletico Madrid in the league this season, partly because he has been hampered by two muscle injuries which have also cost him a place on Spain\u2019s national team.\n\nSaturday offers an ideal scenario for Costa to break out of his slump when Atletico hosts Barcelona on Saturday with the league lead on the line. Barcelona leads the competition by one point ahead of three teams, including Atletico in third place.\n\nCosta is expected to be cleared to play against Barcelona after returning to practice this week following an international break.\n\nTrue to coach Diego Simeone\u2019s emphasis on keeping a clean sheet, Atletico is in the title hunt thanks to a stingy defense that has given it six wins, five draws and one loss. The team leads the league with only eight goals allowed, while scoring 16. That contrasts with Barcelona, which has scored a league-leading 34 times and conceded 18 goals.\n\nAfter an erratic start to his career when he was loaned out to several smaller clubs, Costa found a backer when Simeone took over the team in 2011. The match was perfect. Costa gave Simeone the enforcer on the field that he needed to inspire his code of maximum effort from his players.\n\nThe result was the club\u2019s most successful era. Costa helped win the 2013 Copa del Rey title and was the driving force in attack for Atletico\u2019s 2014 league win.\n\n\u201cHe gives us strength and energy,\u201d Simeone said about Costa last month. \u201cIt is important to have his personality and force. ... He gives a boost to our fans, his teammates and our coaching staff.\u201d\n\nCosta returned to Atletico midway through last season after spending three years at Chelsea, where he won two Premier League titles. Despite only scoring three goals in the league, he helped Atletico win the Europa League title and finish second to Barcelona in the league.\n\nAfter scoring three goals for Spain at the World Cup, the Costa of old appeared to have resurfaced at the start of this season when he netted two goals in a 4-2 win over Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup in August. But his only other goal in any competition since then came on Sept. 18 when he scored in a 2-1 win at Monaco in the Champions League.\n\nSimeone still values Costa\u2019s contributions even when he is not scoring goals. That said, Costa\u2019s problem is not a question of lacking his scoring touch or running across inspired goalkeepers.\n\nHe is not producing the scoring chances of a top-notch striker.\n\nCosta has only managed to generate seven shots in the league this season. Teammate Antoine Griezmann has three goals from 24 shots, while Barcelona counterpart Luis Suarez has scored nine goals from 36 shots.\n\nAnd it seems that Simeone may be losing faith in the player.\n\nSimeone substituted Costa at halftime of the 3-2 win over Athletic Bilbao after seeing he was incapable of threatening to score or set up a teammate.\n\nSimeone, however, doesn\u2019t have a great second option if he wants to sit Costa against Barcelona. His only other true striker is the untested Nikola Kalinic. Otherwise, he could align another playmaker like Angel Correa or forwards Victor \u201cVitolo\u201d Machin or Gelson Martins, or just bulk up his defense to slow down Lionel Messi.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Kaczynski is suing Walesa for blaming him for a 2010 plane crash that killed his twin, then-President Lech Kaczynski. (Wojciech Strozyk/Associated Press)\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Two of Poland\u2019s most famous foes, former President Lech Walesa, and the country\u2019s de facto leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, faced off in court Thursday, exchanging wry comments.\n\nKaczynski, the powerful head of the ruling Law and Justice party, is suing Walesa for blaming him in social media posts for the 2010 plane crash in Smolensk, Russia, that killed Kaczynski\u2019s twin, then-President Lech Kaczynski, along with 95 others including top Polish political and military leaders.\n\nIn one 2016 post, Walesa alleged that Kaczynski, \u201cguided by bravado,\u201d was on the phone pushing for the plane to land in heavy fog. It\u2019s an allegation sometimes made by Kaczynski\u2019s critics, but no evidence has ever emerged to prove it.\n\nKaczynski wants Walesa to admit his words were untrue and that he be forced to pay 30,000 zlotys ($8,000) to charity.\n\nThis is the latest in the long history of feuding between Walesa, the 75-year-old founder of the 1980s Solidarity pro-democracy movement that peacefully ended communism in Poland, and Kaczynski, his former ally and aide.\n\nKaczynski, 69, and his twin, who was a top Solidarity activist, promoted Walesa to be democratic Poland\u2019s first popularly chosen president in 1990. They became his closest aides, but soon bitterly fell out with him in still unclear circumstances. Walesa has claimed that the brothers wanted control over him.\n\nThe Kaczynskis alleged he had been a communist collaborator codenamed \u201cBolek,\u201d which Walesa denies and says documents suggesting that were forged.\n\nKaczynski insists that Poland\u2019s transformation to democracy was imperfect and left a lot of political and financial influence in the hands of the former communist rulers.\n\nOutside the courtroom in Walesa\u2019s hometown, the Baltic port city of Gdansk, the former allies-turned foes sparred verbally.\n\n\u201cWhy did I ever make you my minister?\u201d Walesa asked Kaczynski as they stood together before entering the courtroom, calling him \u201cmy great mistake.\n\n\u201cWhy did I ever make you the president?\u201d Kaczynski retorted, though both could be seen smiling. He also called Walesa his \u201cgreat mistake\u201d and an \u201cembarrassment.\u201d\n\nToday, Walesa is a bitter critic of the government that Kaczynski guides from behind the scenes, accusing it of eroding the democracy he helped bring to life. He arrived in court wearing a T-shirt with the word \u201cKonstytucja\u201d (Constitution), which has been a rallying cry of the anti-government opposition.\n\nKaczynski was dressed in a black suit and tie, the attire he has always worn publicly since his brother perished.\n\nDespite the court\u2019s encouragement, they failed to reach an agreement, so more court sessions will be held.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Eugene Hoshiko/Associated Press)\n\nTOKYO \u2014 Nissan Motor Co. Chairman Carlos Ghosn is in custody in Tokyo after his arrest this week for alleged financial improprieties. Japanese prosecutors have been very tight-lipped about details of their investigation. But on Thursday they confirmed Ghosn is not getting VIP treatment and is subject to the same Spartan conditions faced by any other detainee in Japan. A look at what is known about Ghosn\u2019s situation:\n\nQ: WHERE IS GHOSN?\n\nA: Prosecutors say Ghosn is detained at the Tokyo Detention House, a 12-story building in downtown Tokyo\u2019s Katsushika district. About 3,000 people, mostly pre-trial suspects, defendants and some death row inmates, are held there. It is one of Japan\u2019s eight detention centers. The facility\u2019s gallows were used in July to hang cult leader Shoko Asahara, the mastermind of a Tokyo subway gassing and other crimes.\n\nQ: WHAT IS LIFE LIKE IN DETENTION?\n\nA: Officials say Ghosn has met with officials from the French Embassy and a lawyer. Under Japan\u2019s criminal justice procedures, his counsel is not allowed to attend questioning by prosecutors. Tokyo deputy prosecutor Shin Kukimoto said Ghosn is being treated just like any other detainee, with about eight hours of sleep and three simple meals a day.\n\nQ: WHAT ARE INTERROGATIONS LIKE IN JAPAN?\n\nA: Kukimoto said Ghosn is being questioned for several hours a day in a room with prosecutors and a translator. He gave no further details and would not say if Ghosn has acknowledged the allegations. Japanese investigators once were notorious for lengthy, tough interrogations of suspects denied contact with their lawyers. Conditions have improved in recent years with increased awareness of human rights standards.\n\nQ: WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST GHOSN AND POSSIBLE PENALTIES?\n\nA: Ghosn, who was arrested with Nissan representative director Greg Kelly, is suspected of violating financial reporting laws which carry a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison or a fine up to 10 million yen ($89,000) if he is convicted.\n\nQ: WHAT\u2019S NEXT?\n\nA: Wednesday\u2019s court approval of 10-day detention allows prosecutors to keep Ghosn through Nov. 30. They could extend that by another 10 days before having to decide whether to indict him, though they could add new allegations and win more time \u2014 20 days per charge. He is unlikely to be released on bail anytime soon.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Bebeto Matthews/Associated Press)\n\n2018 has been a rough year for the world. Autocrats seized control; terrorism and hate crimes are on the rise; and scientists say climate change is now almost certain to have catastrophic effects. And then there\u2019s Yemen.\n\nEven so, there were a couple of bright spots. Since it\u2019s Thanksgiving, we thought we\u2019d take stock of a couple of foreign policy trends, shifts and happenings that left us smiling:\n\n1. Europe\u2019s now got a really strong data protection plan in place\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation, better known by its acronym GDPR, went into effect earlier this year. Nearly six years in the making, the GDPR lays out strong rules for what companies can do with your data. It limits what businesses can do and gives users much more control over the information they put online.\n\nUnder the GDPR, companies must tell users what information is being collected, how it\u2019s being used, how long it will be retained. Though it only protects the data of Europeans, it may reshape how big companies operate more broadly.\n\nPrivacy advocates quibble with some parts of the framework. But in general, they hail it as the most significant data protection breakthrough ever.\n\n2. Ethiopia and Eritrea came to a groundbreaking peace. Oh, and Ethiopia appointed a female president.\n\nEthiopia and Eritrea had been locked in conflict for nearly two decades. The Economist described it as a \u201ccold war that once seemed irresolvable.\u201d The struggle was nominally over contested land at the border of the two countries. Over the years, Ethiopia and Eritrea sent thousands of troops to the border and armed each other\u2019s rebels.\n\nBut this summer, the two countries made peace and restored normal relations, easing tension around the region. \u201cThere is a wind of hope blowing in the Horn of Africa,\u201d U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told journalists after the signing of the peace accord. \u201cIt is not only the peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea \u2014 it is the fact that tomorrow and the day after tomorrow we will have, here in Saudi Arabia, the president of Djibouti and the president of Eritrea \u2014 two countries that have also been at odds with each other.\u201d\n\nThe peace comes against a backdrop of unprecedented changes in Ethiopia\u2019s once authoritarian government, including prisoner releases, economic opening and opposition figures allowed back in the country. Most dramatically has been the appointment of women in several top posts, including half the cabinet ministers, the head of the Supreme Court and even the president of the country, the largely ceremonial head of state.\n\n3. After six decades, the remains of more than 50 U.S. service members were returned to the United States from North Korea\n\nNearly 8,000 U.S. troops are unaccounted for from the Korean War. This summer, North Korea returned the remains of what is believed to be about 50 service members. (U.S. officials are still working to identify them.) Vice President Pence called it \u201ctangible progress in our efforts to keep peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d But for families who lost their loved ones, it means something more personal: \u201cYou just cannot fathom the suffering that these families endure,\u201d Sherri Steward, who lost her father and uncle during the Korean War, told AARP. \u201cThe Korean War ended for the young men who perished there, but for families of those whose remains have not been recovered, the Korean War never has ended.\u201d\n\n4. The #MeToo movement went global\n\nA little more than a year ago, the New York Times and New Yorker published stories about Harvey Weinstein, a powerful Hollywood producer who allegedly sexually harassed and assaulted dozens of women with impunity. That story sparked an international movement. Around the world, women shared their stories.\n\nIn Britain, the \u201cWestminster dossier,\u201d an online spreadsheet, exposed the alleged misconduct of more than 40 politicians. In Japan, journalist Shiori Ito publicly accused a prominent journalist of rape. In Australia, television personality Don Burke (often described as the country\u2019s \u201cWeinstein\u201d) was accused of bullying and harassment by several current and former employees. In China, several prominent professors and television producers stepped down after accusations. Even in conservative Indonesia, a woman was able to successfully push for the prosecution of the man who assaulted her after she obtained video footage.\n\nAs my colleagues wrote on the first anniversary of the movement: \u201cFrom Stockholm to Seoul, from Toronto to Tokyo, a torrent of accusations has poured forth. Survivors spoke out, and many were taken seriously. Powerful men lost their jobs. A few went to prison. How diverse societies \u2014 some liberal, others conservative \u2014 saw sexual harassment seemed to be changing.\u201d\n\n5. The price of solar panels fell \u2014 a lot\n\nIt may be one of the only bits of good news in the fight against climate change this year: The price of solar panels is falling even faster than experts expected. Jenny Chase, an expert on solar panel pricing, said the technology has gotten better faster than expected. As a result, solar panel installations have skyrocketed. Solar panels, of course, tap a renewable energy resource and don\u2019t produce greenhouse gasses. If we want to slow the production of carbon dioxide, experts say solar energy will have to be part of the solution.\n\n\u201cSolar power is going to dominate the energy sector this century,\u201d Ars Technica wrote earlier this year. \u201cThe question is just how quickly it will bring down costs and take over the world.

(Hussein Malla/Associated Press)\n\nBEIRUT \u2014 Lebanon is marking 75 years of independence with a military parade Thursday in Beirut, but many anxious Lebanese feel they have little to celebrate: the country\u2019s corruption-plagued economy is dangerously close to collapse and political bickering over shares in a new Cabinet is threatening to scuttle pledges worth $11 billion by international donors.\n\nThe World Bank issued a stark warning last week, with one official saying that unless a government is formed soon to carry out badly needed reforms, \u201cthe Lebanon we know will fizzle away.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since Lebanon held its first national elections in nine years but the prime minister-designate, Saad Hariri, still hasn\u2019t formed a government to undertake the reforms necessary to unlock the donors\u2019 funds.\n\nThe vote, in which the Shiite militant Hezbollah group and its allies made significant gains, did little to pull Lebanon out of a political impasse. Anger against politicians\u2019 apparent indifference, worsening public services and distress over down-spiraling finances and gloomy predictions are building up.\n\nLast Friday, heavy rains caused Beirut\u2019s sewage system to burst, turning the city\u2019s famous Mediterranean coastal avenue into a river of filthy, foul-smelling black water that engulfed motorists along the otherwise scenic route. On the same day, the military had closed a main artery for drills ahead of the Independence Day parade, paralyzing traffic for hours. Flights from Beirut\u2019s international airport were missed and a woman reportedly went into labor on the road. The army later apologized.\n\nDespite a population of over 4.5 million that is among the most educated in the region, Lebanon still has a primitive infrastructure, widespread electricity and water cuts and a longstanding waste crisis that over the past few years saw trash piling in the streets for weeks at a time.\n\n\u201cThere is no independence (to celebrate) because corruption is eating us up,\u201d said Mohammed al-Rayyes, a shop owner in Beirut\u2019s Hamra district. \u201cThe coming days are going to be very difficult.\u201d\n\nThe tiny Arab country has coped with multiple political and security crises over the past decades and also suffered from the seven-year civil war in neighboring Syria, a conflict that has occasionally spilled over the border and brought more than 1 million refugees into Lebanon, putting even more pressure on its dysfunctional infrastructure.\n\nA soaring debt of $84 billion and unemployment believed to be around 36 percent are compounding concerns that the country will finally cave in.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame because so much time is being wasted,\u201d Ferid Belhaj, the World Bank\u2019s vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, said during a meeting with a group of journalists last week.\n\nFor years, he said, Lebanese officials have been promising to work on solving the electricity crisis, which costs the country about $2 billion a year and has been the main factor in accumulating Lebanon\u2019s debt.\n\nOf immediate concern is the future of $11 billion in loans and grants pledged by international donors at a meeting in Paris in April, which Lebanon risks losing if no Cabinet is in place soon to unlock the funds and approve reforms that were set as conditions by the donors and which have been delayed for years. In April, Hariri pledged to reduce the budget deficit by 5 percent over the next five years.\n\nThe crisis has prompted some Lebanese to change their deposits from the local currency, which has been pegged to the U.S. dollars since 1997, to U.S. dollars for fear the Lebanese pound might collapse. Riad Salameh, the Central Bank governor, has been repeatedly reassuring the markets, saying the local currency is stable.\n\nMohamad Shukeir, head of the Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, told the local MTV station that 2,200 businesses closed doors so far this year.\n\nAftershocks of rising tension between the United States and Iran are also felt in Beirut, with Tehran ally Hezbollah being blamed by opponents for preventing Western-backed Hariri from forming a national unity government.\n\nHezbollah has demanded that six Sunni lawmakers allied with the Shiite group and opposed to Hariri be included in his Cabinet \u2014 something that Hariri, the country\u2019s top Sunni Muslim leader, categorically rejects.\n\nDespite the dangers, political bickering is not likely to end soon and the debt is mounting.\n\n\u201cThe level of debt that we have in Lebanon requires us to act very quickly,\u201d said economist Kamel Wazne. \u201cAny delay will expose us to financial collapse.\u201d\n\nBelhaj of the World Bank said that reforms would act as a buffer to the crisis. But in their absence, \u201cthe crisis can be very nasty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t go about these reforms fast, the Lebanon that we know will fizzle away,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Fadi Tawil in Beirut contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Here\u2019s some of the responses, and I will be adding to the list in the coming days.\n\nWALTER ISAACSON\n\nIsaacson is a professor of history at Tulane University and the author of a number of best-selling books about pivotal historical figures. They include his most recent book, \u201cLeonardo da Vinci,\u201d as well as \u201cThe Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution,\" \u201cSteve Jobs,\" \u201cEinstein: His Life and Universe,\u201d \u201cBenjamin Franklin: An American Life,\u201d and \u201cKissinger: A Biography.\u201d He is also the coauthor of \u201cThe Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made,\" and is a former chairman of CNN as well as a former editor of Time magazine,\n\nSchools should be nurturing curiosity, rather than dampening the curiosity that comes naturally in our wonder years. Leonardo da Vinci was the person in history who was most passionately curious about everything there was to know about every subject that was knowable. That led him to love both the arts and sciences, the humanities and technology. Thus he became the world\u2019s most creative genius, because he had a marvelous feel for the patterns that ripple throughout creation.\n\nKEN BURNS:\n\nBurns is an award-winning filmmaker who is known for using archival footage and photographs in his multi-part documentaries, which include \u201cThe Civil War,\u201d \u201cBaseball,\u201d \u201cJazz,\u201d \u201cThe War,\u201d \u201cThe National Parks: America\u2019s Best Idea,\" \u201cProhibition,\u201d \u201cThe Roosevelts,\u201d and \u201cThe Vietnam War.\u201d\n\nSome thoughts for students ... and teachers who are confronted with a difficult but hugely exciting time to help educate them: respect people with different opinions, read everything you can find, follow your passion and listen even when you disagree.\n\nTALITHA LeFLOURIA\n\nLeFlouria is the Lisa Smith Discovery associate professor in African and African American Studies at the University of Virginia, who specializes in mass incarceration, modern slavery, race and medicine, and black women in America. She is the author of the award-winning \u201cChained in Silence: Black Women and Convict Labor in the New South,\u201d and a forthcoming book on black women and mass incarceration. She serves on the board of directors of the organizations Historians Against Slavery and the Association of Black Women Historians.\n\nKids should be taught about slavery\u2019s demise. But they should also learn about its evolution and its legacies. This is the most important thing kids should be learning in school today. They should know that slavery didn\u2019t end after the Civil War. It evolved. The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution legally abolished slavery, \u201cexcept as a punishment for a crime.\u201d This clause enabled \u201cslavery by another name\u201d to continue through the prison system. From the late 1860s until the 1920s (and even today!), thousands of African American men, women, and youth were virtually re-enslaved through a system known as convict leasing. If an individual was convicted of a felony offense, he or she would be forcibly leased to a private company or factory by the state for a fee. Although leased convicts were not slaves in the legal sense of the word, their lived experiences resembled the enslaved. They worked from sunup to sundown; they were beaten and flogged, and the women were raped; their humanity was denied; they were severely punished if they escaped; they were separated from their families; and many were made to serve life sentences. Leased convicts helped build modern America. They deserve to be included in our history books.\n\nALEX KERSHAW\n\nKershaw is a historian and the author of 10 books, including the New York Times best-sellers on World War II: \u201cThe Bedford Boys,\u201d \u201cThe Longest Winter\u201d and \u201cAvenue of Spies: A True Story of Terror, Espionage, and One American Family\u2019s Heroic Resistance in Nazi-Occupied Paris.\u201d He has also written biographies of Jack London, Raoul Wallenberg and Robert Capa. And his most recently completed work is \u201cCitizens & Soldiers: The First 200 Years of Norwich University.\u201d\n\nAs a British immigrant to the U.S., I would suggest that the most important lesson to teach from American history today is that diversity has always been the country\u2019s greatest strength. It is a nation of immigrants, of all faiths, drawn from around the globe. It is a nation based on the most noble of ideals. Every one of us should have equal rights. Any form of racism, sexism and indeed nationalism is profoundly unAmerican.\n\nSOPHIA ROSENFELD\n\nRosenfeld is Walter H. Annenberg Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of several books including \u201cDemocracy and Truth: A Short History,\u201d which will be published in December, and the award-winning \u201cCommon Sense: A Political History.\u201d She teaches European intellectual and cultural history with a special emphasis on the Enlightenment, the trans-Atlantic Age of Revolutions, and the legacy of the eighteenth century for modern democracy.\n\nRather than highlight a specific moment in history looking for lessons for our crazy present, I would try to teach students something about the nature and history of truth. And I\u2019d do so in such a way as to simultaneously highlight some basic principles of democracy. First, students need to learn how historians establish factual knowledge about the past\u2014whether that means the existence of the Crusades or the unemployment rate last year. Evidence collection, interpretation, verification: these are all vital skills (more so than ever in the age of the internet and social media) that students can only learn from doing themselves. So is distinguishing proven truths, or knowledge, from falsehoods or unproven beliefs. I would also make sure that students understand how essential agreement about basic facts is for determining effective policy and even for engaging in productive political debates with people holding different values, two key democratic activities. But I\u2019d also go back to the moment of the Federalist Papers and the writing of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights to emphasize that one of the unusual qualities of modern democracy is its insistence on an open-ended view of truth. No single person or organization, from a church to the federal government, gets to say definitively what counts as truth. Moreover, even the most long-held truths are always potentially subject to revision. So I\u2019d also take the opportunity, with students of any age, to show on what grounds truths, whether they are scientific or historical or both, can be legitimately questioned and reformulated. And I\u2019d show the ways this process too is part of the history of democracy. History education matters right now, and one big reason is because it teaches citizens-in-training both how to establish truth and how to take a critical eye to much of what passes for it in the world today.\n\nJAMES GROSSMAN\n\nGrossman is executive director of the American Historical Association. A former vice president of research and education at the independent Newberry Library in Chicago, he has taught at the University of Chicago and the University of California at San Diego. His work has focused on American urban history, African American history, ethnicity, higher education, and the place of history in public culture. He is a former editor of the award-winning series, \u201cHistorical Studies of Urban America,\u201d and the author of \u201cLand of Hope: Chicago, Black Southerners, and the Great Migration\u201d and \u201cA Chance to Make Good: African Americans, 1900-1929.\u201d\n\nThe most important lesson this fall, common to all classrooms, is an appreciation for evidence. All disciplines have standards of evidence. The power of liberal education lies, in part, in the diversity of these standards, in the different ways disciplines require that an argument be woven, substantiated, and articulated. Consider the simple question that can be posed from kindergarten to a PhD dissertation defense: \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d From the earliest age, a child can learn that assertion is not enough. \u201cBecause I say so,\u201d offers no reason to raise one narrative, argument, or claim above another. \u201cI read it on the internet\u201d isn\u2019t much better. Education is a process by which a student learns how to find, sift, and organize evidence while at the same time gaining the critical thinking skills necessary to evaluate evidence and identify claims based on mere assertion. All students should also learn that \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d is a legitimate question, rather than an existential challenge. Eventually students should acquire an understanding of context: in this case, the difference between the nature of evidence in a laboratory, a courtroom, a debate forum, or a legislative hearing. These spaces map roughly onto disciplines \u2013 sciences, law, rhetoric, political science. Other disciplines take their evidence from texts, or from works of art and music. Students at all levels can learn to use these different forms of evidence to build stories about past and present, near and far. And in each case, an instructor can ask them \u201chow do you know that?\u201d As a historian, I look for evidence from the past, an activity (and then a skill) accessible to students from an early age given the cornucopia of available digitized visual sources. Our evidence, like our rules for using it, differs from colleagues in other disciplines. Unlike a scientist we cannot create evidence, other than perhaps oral histories. Nor can we replicate data, and hence must learn to balance intellectual confidence with uncertainty. We invoke \u2013 carefully and critically \u2013 evidence that would be dismissed as \u201chearsay\u201d in a court of law. We look for the most compelling narrative, a tapestry of disparate sources that can be quantitative, visual, material, written, or oral; ours is a standard more attainable than a courtroom\u2019s requirement of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d These different forms, protocols, and standards of evidence enable students eventually to choose which modes they find most interesting. Careers are built on such choices. But so are communities and civic cultures. The voter needs to respect evidence every bit as much as the civil engineer and the physician. That respect begins in the classroom.\n\nJACK SCHNEIDER\n\nJack Schneider is an education historian who is assistant professor of education at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell as well as the director of research for the Massachusetts Consortium for Innovative Education Assessment. He is the author of three books, the most recent of which is \u201cBeyond Test Scores: A Better Way to Measure School Quality.\u201d He is also co-host of the education policy podcast Have You Heard. Follow him on Twitter: @Edu_Historian.\n\nEverybody loves to tell teachers what to do. If we charged a dollar every time someone wanted to pontificate about classroom instruction, we'd have no problem adequately funding our schools. That said, I would encourage teachers to include something in the curriculum that hasn\u2019t traditionally been there \u2014 instruction in the meaning and origins of public education. Knowing the history of an institution is always important for those implicated in its operation. Without such knowledge, an organization's activities can seem natural and preordained. In fact, they are neither. What seems normal today is merely a reflection of cultural acclimation. In order to recognize the water in which we metaphorically swim, we must examine how things once were, why they evolved as they did, and how else they might have been. But there is a new reason to collectively reflect on the concept and practice of public education. For the past several decades, public schools have been subject to what David Berliner and Bruce Biddle once called a manufactured crisis. And though many of us have become inured to it, others \u2014 teachers, students, families \u2014 have been deeply affected by the rhetoric of catastrophe in public education. In the the past two years, this assault has taken on new intensity. Though they have not said it so plainly, our present Secretary of Education and her allies would like nothing better than to dismantle the public education system. The origins of public schools and their evolution across roughly two centuries may be worth a bit of instructional time \u2014 in this present moment, at least. Why did Americans create taxpayer-supported schools? What were the alternatives? Whom have they served over the years? How have they changed? There are plenty of dogmatic assertions about these matters. But the truth is more complicated than the claims of critics and cynics. And though our schools have flaws \u2014 segregation being the most troubling of them \u2014 those shortcomings are best understood in the context of a discussion grounded in fact. Attending a public school need not be a point of pride for young people. Yet it is unquestionably a right, and it might even be a privilege. So this fall, I would encourage teachers to take some time in class to talk about why we\u2019re all here, engaging in this exercise that we\u2019ve been repeating across the generations. After all, the public schools belong to us. Insofar as that\u2019s the case, they are as we have made them: full of promise, possibility, and problems. Just like America.\n\n(Note: An earlier version of this post mistakenly repeated one of the quotes.

A court in the southern city of Krasnodar sentenced Husky on charges of hooliganism.\n\nThe 25-year-old rapper, known for his songs mocking authorities and police brutality, was due to perform in Krasnodar when local prosecutors warned the venue that his act had elements of what they termed \u201cextremism.\u201d\n\nRussian authorities have in recent years used the vaguely worded law on extremism to go after Kremlin critics and dissenters.\n\nWednesday\u2019s gig was moved to another club, where the power was shut off and Husky\u2019s fans poured outside. Videos posted online showed the rapper, whose real name is Dmitry Kuznetsov, reading his verses on top of a car with the fans chanting in unison.\n\nPolice officers let him finish the song and then detained him, but had trouble driving away as crowds of fans blocked the police vehicle, demanding his release.

(Hussein Malla/Associated Press)\n\nBEIRUT \u2014 Lebanon marked 75 years of independence with a military parade Thursday in Beirut, but many anxious Lebanese feel they have little to celebrate: the country\u2019s corruption-plagued economy is dangerously close to collapse and political bickering over shares in a new Cabinet is threatening to scuttle pledges worth $11 billion by international donors.\n\nThe World Bank issued a stark warning last week, with one official saying that unless a government is formed soon to carry out badly needed reforms, \u201cthe Lebanon we know will fizzle away.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since Lebanon held its first national elections in nine years but the prime minister-designate, Saad Hariri, still hasn\u2019t formed a government to undertake the reforms necessary to unlock the donors\u2019 funds.\n\nThe vote, in which the Shiite militant Hezbollah group and its allies made significant gains, did little to pull Lebanon out of a political impasse. Anger against politicians\u2019 apparent indifference, worsening public services and distress over down-spiraling finances and gloomy predictions are building up.\n\nLast Friday, heavy rains caused Beirut\u2019s sewage system to burst, turning the city\u2019s famous Mediterranean coastal avenue into a river of filthy, foul-smelling black water that engulfed motorists along the otherwise scenic route. On the same day, the military had closed a main artery for drills ahead of the Independence Day parade, paralyzing traffic for hours. Flights from Beirut\u2019s international airport were missed and a woman reportedly went into labor on the road. The army later apologized.\n\nOn Thursday, Lebanese President Michel Aoun and the country\u2019s top officials watched an hour-long military parade along Beirut\u2019s waterfront as helicopters hovered overhead. The city center was closed off for the duration of the spectacle.\n\nAs soon as the parade ended, dozens of protesters took to the streets to voice their impatience with the political stalemate. Some denounced corruption, while others ranted about electricity shortages, fraying infrastructure or increasing pollution levels. Many wore T-shirts with the inscription: \u201cOur independence from you exploitation.\u201d\n\nDespite a population of over 4.5 million that is among the most educated in the region, Lebanon still has a primitive infrastructure, widespread electricity and water cuts and a longstanding waste crisis that over the past few years saw trash piling in the streets for weeks at a time.\n\n\u201cThere is no independence (to celebrate) because corruption is eating us up,\u201d said Mohammed al-Rayyes, a shop owner in Beirut\u2019s Hamra district. \u201cThe coming days are going to be very difficult.\u201d\n\nThe tiny Arab country has coped with multiple political and security crises over the past decades and also suffered from the seven-year civil war in neighboring Syria, a conflict that has occasionally spilled over the border and brought more than 1 million refugees into Lebanon, putting even more pressure on its dysfunctional infrastructure.\n\nA soaring debt of $84 billion and unemployment believed to be around 36 percent are compounding concerns that the country will finally cave in.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame because so much time is being wasted,\u201d Ferid Belhaj, the World Bank\u2019s vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, said during a meeting with a group of journalists last week.\n\nFor years, he said, Lebanese officials have been promising to work on solving the electricity crisis, which costs the country about $2 billion a year and has been the main factor in accumulating Lebanon\u2019s debt.\n\nOf immediate concern is the future of $11 billion in loans and grants pledged by international donors at a meeting in Paris in April, which Lebanon risks losing if no Cabinet is in place soon to unlock the funds and approve reforms that were set as conditions by the donors and which have been delayed for years. In April, Hariri pledged to reduce the budget deficit by 5 percent over the next five years.\n\nThe crisis has prompted some Lebanese to change their deposits from the local currency, which has been pegged to the U.S. dollars since 1997, to U.S. dollars for fear the Lebanese pound might collapse. Riad Salameh, the Central Bank governor, has been repeatedly reassuring the markets, saying the local currency is stable.\n\nMohamad Shukeir, head of the Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, told the local MTV station that 2,200 businesses closed doors so far this year.\n\nAftershocks of rising tension between the United States and Iran are also felt in Beirut, with Tehran ally Hezbollah being blamed by opponents for preventing Western-backed Hariri from forming a national unity government.\n\nHezbollah has demanded that six Sunni lawmakers allied with the Shiite group and opposed to Hariri be included in his Cabinet \u2014 something that Hariri, the country\u2019s top Sunni Muslim leader, categorically rejects.\n\nDespite the dangers, political bickering is not likely to end soon and the debt is mounting.\n\n\u201cThe level of debt that we have in Lebanon requires us to act very quickly,\u201d said economist Kamel Wazne. \u201cAny delay will expose us to financial collapse.\u201d\n\nBelhaj of the World Bank said that reforms would act as a buffer to the crisis. But in their absence, \u201cthe crisis can be very nasty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t go about these reforms fast, the Lebanon that we know will fizzle away,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Fadi Tawil in Beirut contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Matt Sayles/Invision/AP)\n\nWhen does the holiday season actually begin? Many, perhaps most of us, would peg the start of the season somewhere around Thanksgiving. But a completely nonrepresentative social media poll suggests a fair amount of dissent: Some cheerful souls say the holidays start right after Halloween. More than a few Grinches, on the other hand, would push the start of the season back past Dec. 1.\n\nGiven the disagreement on the particulars, as a public service I\u2019ve assembled what I believe to be the first truly objective measure of when the holiday season starts and ends. Similar to my groundbreaking delineation of decorative gourd season several years back, it relies on Google Trends data to measure how people behave, rather than what they say they believe.\n\nI present you the \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Index of Holiday Cheer.\u201d\n\nYes, we can use interest in Mariah Carey\u2019s iconic holiday standard as a proxy for feelings of what we might call holiday cheer. The 1994 single tops Billboard\u2019s list of the most popular holiday songs of all time, bolstered in part by the song\u2019s appearance in the 2003 holiday romance \u201cLove Actually.\u201d The New Yorker\u2019s Sasha Frere-Jones called it \u201cone of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon.\u201d For many listeners, the song is quite literally the sound of contemporary Christmas.\n\nThat\u2019s why it makes for such a good barometer of holiday cheer. The thick blue line in the chart above shows weekly average Google search interest in \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d (henceforth abbreviated as AIWFCIY), for the second half of the year from 2006 through 2017. Individual years' lines are in light grey.\n\nAn important caveat with these figures, as with all Google search data, is that they don\u2019t necessarily tell us why people are searching for a given topic. Some of these searches are from people who want to listen to, download or buy the song. Others may just be interested in learning more about who sings it or who wrote it.\n\nWhat they do unequivocally show, however, is interest. And there, the chart yields some surprises.\n\nNotice, for instance, that the thick blue average line starts showing a slight but very noticeable upward trend starting around mid-September. This suggests that some Americans start getting into the holiday spirit right around the start of fall \u2014 perhaps those same insufferable people who always boast about having their Christmas shopping done by the end of September.\n\nThere\u2019s another noticeable break near the end of October, as the line veers sharply upward. It\u2019s Halloween, stores are starting to stock their holiday items, and some people clearly give in to the temptation and go full Mariah before Nov. 1.\n\nMid-November marks the final escalation in AIWFCIY search activity. Incidentally, that\u2019s the same time Spotify data show the United States typically crosses the \u201cserious\u201d Christmas music threshold, when at least 2 percent of all streams on the service are of Christmas music. And the No. 1 Christmas track in the United States? You know what it is.\n\nFrom mid-November through Christmas week, AIWFCIY search activity shows a steep upward trajectory. Its slope flattens out a touch around mid-December \u2014 perhaps a reflection of the holiday shopping blues? But Americans rally, and searches reach their peak right around Christmas before falling back to earth in the run-up to the new year.\n\nSo how\u2019s 2018 shaping up relative to prior years? Behold:\n\nAIWFCIY searches are currently trending well ahead of prior years. Interest in the song is currently higher than at any point in the past decade or so for which Google has numbers. Is this because people need more holiday cheer this year, or are they simply feeling more festive? Again, the numbers don\u2019t tell us exactly why they\u2019re searching, but it is clear that this holiday season people need more Mariah in their lives than usual.\n\nTo return to our initial question, the aggregate numbers suggest there\u2019s a strong case to be made that the holiday season really starts in the run-up to Halloween, when AIWFCIY searches start to tick upward in earnest.

A total of 799 pounds of turkey went to troops serving on the border in southern Texas.\n\nLike many of the Pentagon\u2019s initiatives, the Thanksgiving rollout was an affair of giant scale: 51,234 pounds of roasted turkey, 16,284 pounds of sweet potatoes, 81,360 pies, 19,284 cakes and 7,836 gallons of eggnog. Forces around the world received the goods through the vast military supply chain that keeps those serving in combat equipped with medicine, food and more.\n\n\u201cMany of America\u2019s military men and women are away from home this Thanksgiving, making sacrifices to secure our freedom and to protect our southern border,\u201d Army Brig. Gen. Mark T. Simerly, the commander of troop support for the Defense Logistics Agency, said in a statement. He said the military was providing them \u201cthe very best Thanksgiving meal our country has to offer.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for U.S. Army North, which oversees the Army\u2019s part of the deployment, said that Thursday would be a \u201clight-duty day\u201d for troops deployed along the border, meaning they would be asked to do little, if any, work. No troops had been sent home to their regular duty stations or moved among the border mission sites, she said.\n\n\n\nA U.S. Army soldier serves a Thanksgiving meal to his comrades in Kabul on Thursday. (Mohammad Ismail/Reuters)\n\nMany bases host traditional Thanksgiving meals in their dining halls. Those deployed farther afield often find more-creative ways to celebrate, whether that means frying a turkey on a combat outpost in Afghanistan or eating Thanksgiving dinner on a submarine.\n\nOften a select few get treated to meals with senior leaders, who typically visit the troops on Thanksgiving and Christmas as a show of thanks for their sacrifice. President George W. Bush famously flew into Iraq under the cover of night to mark Thanksgiving with the troops in 2003, months after the invasion.\n\nThe tradition of making sure that forces deployed over the Thanksgiving holiday receive their turkey dates back decades. The Pentagon supplied turkey and cranberry sauce to troops serving overseas during World War II. The tradition followed in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSome of the troops deployed to the border in Texas marked Thanksgiving in place, with the turkey sent over by the Pentagon. Others deployed to California and Arizona will go to military bases near their border outposts to celebrate the holiday, according to a spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency.\n\nTraditionally, Thanksgiving festivities among deployed troops have been as uncontroversial as military events come, with the Pentagon widely publicizing sacrifices that those in uniform make while serving the country over the holidays.\n\nBut questions about the deployment of roughly 5,800 troops to the border with Mexico have made the Thanksgiving celebrations there something of a political football.\n\nCritics have accused President Trump of using the military for a political stunt, deploying forces to the border to rally his base before this month\u2019s midterm elections. He has been focused on Central American migrants moving through Mexico with hopes of seeking asylum in the United States, suggesting the caravans of people \u2014 many of them destitute families fleeing violence and financial hardship \u2014 pose a security threat. Trump\u2019s critics have said the fact that these troops will miss Thanksgiving with their families is an insult.\n\n\u201cOur troops and their families deserve better than to be used as props, @realDonaldTrump,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a tweet this week. \u201cLet them go home.\u201d\n\nTrump, who spent the Thanksgiving holiday at his Mar-a-Lago estate, dismissed the criticism, saying those serving on the border were proud to be representing the United States there and deterring \u201ctough people\u201d from coming into the country.\n\nTrump also told reporters Thursday he had \u201cgiven the okay\u201d for U.S. troops to respond with lethal force to anyone crossing the border who presents a threat. U.S. laws generally prohibit military personnel from carrying out domestic law enforcement tasks, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had already indicated an aversion to changing that.\n\nTrump held a televised phone call with military personnel Thursday amid criticism that he has not visited troops in a war zone, a custom of his predecessors in office. When asked whether he would travel to visit deployed service members, Trump said he would \u201cdo some interesting things at the appropriate time.\u201d The president offered no further explanation for those remarks.\n\nAs he did last year, Trump spent part of Thanksgiving at a Coast Guard station in South Florida, shaking hands and posing for photos.\n\nMattis, who spent more than four decades in uniform in the Marine Corps, said the possibility of forces spending Thanksgiving on the border comes with the territory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a 365-day-a-year military. Rain or shine, light or dark, cold weather or hot weather \u2014 we have an all-weather force that\u2019s on duty 24/7,\u201d Mattis said during a recent trip to Texas. \u201cDrive around the Pentagon on Thanksgiving Day and look at the number of cars in the parking lot of people who work right through the holidays.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Mike DeBonis", "title": "With honey instead of vinegar, Pelosi steadily inches toward the speaker\u2019s gavel", "description": "The Democratic leader has personally courted disgruntled members and deployed her sprawling network to bolster her, all but overwhelming her critics.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/with-honey-instead-of-vinegar-pelosi-steadily-inches-toward-the-speakers-gavel/2018/11/21/5559097e-edd8-11e8-baac-2a674e91502b_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D4EHhjEgsuD81ZWQLn2ZGHG3y5Y=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AQO32SHM5UI6RFWUBUR7FKVNBE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T11:00:00Z", "content": "Rep.

The New Yorker had also called her \u201caloof, frenetic, and misguided\u201d earlier this year.\n\nBut Pelosi ignored all that.\n\nInstead, the veteran House Democratic leader went about winning over Higgins this week, listening to the Buffalo lawmaker\u2019s grievances and enlisting allies to convince him that he would see progress on legislation to expand Medicare.\n\nThe strategy worked: On Wednesday, Higgins pulled his name off the anti-Pelosi letter and threw his support behind the 78-year-old leader \u2014 moving her closer to reclaiming the gavel she first won more than a decade ago.\n\nPelosi\u2019s relentless honey-over-vinegar approach to dealing with political headaches \u2014 which she learned at the foot of her father, former Baltimore mayor Thomas D\u2019Alesandro Jr. \u2014 has been critical to sustaining her grip on power since Democrats won the House majority this month.\n\nShe has personally courted disgruntled members in meetings and by phone while deploying her sprawling network to bolster her bid among both liberals and moderates, all but overwhelming her critics with her ability to outmaneuver them.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doesn\u2019t raise her voice; she doesn\u2019t threaten anybody \u2014 that\u2019s not her style,\u201d said Rep.

For now, they might have the numbers to prevent her from winning the floor vote in January \u2014 15 Democrats remain on the letter, at least four more Democrats have said they will oppose her, and dozens more are publicly undecided.\n\nDepending on the outcome of several uncalled races, Pelosi could potentially weather as many as 17 defections on the floor.\n\n\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) is questioned on Nov. 15 by reporters about his opposition to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) becoming House speaker. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nStill, the momentum is clearly with Pelosi. One potential challenger, Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), dropped her plans Tuesday. And two leaders of the opposition, Reps. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) and Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), have found themselves under intense scrutiny by Pelosi supporters accusing them of sexism or disloyalty for pursuing a coup so soon after Democrats\u2019 sweeping gains in the midterms.\n\nAt the moment, no potential Pelosi challenger is even close to preparing to jump into the race and champion their cause, according to Democrats involved in those talks.\n\nDespite her reputation for political hardball, Pelosi has made advances over the past two weeks without resorting to overt threats, according to interviews with more than a dozen aides and members familiar with her efforts. The approach throughout has been purely transactional, rooted in her Little Italy upbringing \u2014 what she called \u201cthe D\u2019Alesandro model\u201d in her 2008 book, \u201cKnow Your Power.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to know how to count the votes, to anticipate how many people will vote for you,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd in order to turn out those votes, you have to be organized on every level.\u201d\n\nPelosi has been in listening mode since Democrats won the House in the Nov. 6 midterms, building a majority that could reach 235 seats. Last week, she conducted a blitz of the major party constituencies \u2014 groups such as the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Black Caucus, among others. Her allies, who include the incoming chairs of every major House committee, have fanned out to solidify her support and discourage her opponents.\n\n[New York congressman who signed letter against Pelosi now says he\u2019ll support her]\n\nRep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.), a leader of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition who has voted against Pelosi in the past, said he has taken calls from House colleagues, senators and home-state bigwigs all urging him to get on board. He described a polite, professional meeting last week with Pelosi during which she made no threats but also gave no ground.\n\nThe Blue Dogs, like other factions inside the party, have been frustrated that Pelosi has shown little sign of relinquishing power after 16 years and making way for younger leaders. Pelosi has spoken of being a \u201ctransitional\u201d speaker but has resisted making any firm retirement plan.\n\n\u201cI told Nancy last week, \u2018None of us are getting any younger,\u2019 \u201d Costa recalled Tuesday. \u201cShe smiled, and she says, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s true. None of us are getting any younger.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn another sign that Pelosi\u2019s potential opposition is softening, a group that threatened to withhold its votes if it doesn\u2019t get a set of House process reforms has started talking about accepting a partial victory and moving on.\n\nThe bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus had called for a significant changes that would curb the power of the majority party\u2019s leadership, including requiring floor votes on certain bipartisan bills and opening up the amendment process.\n\nPelosi last week unveiled proposed reforms that incorporated some of the group\u2019s more modest suggestions but did not include several of its more ambitious demands.\n\nOn a conference call Monday, the Democratic members of the group discussed what sort of compromise they could accept, and co-chairman Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) has been negotiating with Pelosi since then in hopes of reaching a deal.\n\nThere were plenty of other signs this week that her opposition is fizzling. Former president Barack Obama offered effusive praise of Pelosi on Tuesday, while Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel \u2014 who sparred with Pelosi while serving as Obama\u2019s chief of staff \u2014 endorsed her Wednesday.\n\nRep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), a young and influential liberal who has challenged the party\u2019s establishment, has trained her fire on Pelosi\u2019s critics: \u201cSo long as Leader Pelosi remains the most progressive candidate for Speaker, she can count on my support,\u201d she tweeted Wednesday.\n\n[Fight for House speaker explodes into a national political campaign]\n\nMeanwhile, down the Democratic leadership ballot, what could have been a messy free-for-all is looking more like a coronation: Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) remains unopposed for majority leader. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) dropped a challenge to Pelosi\u2019s preferred whip candidate, Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), on Monday. And Pelosi maneuvered to secure the No. 4 spot for Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-N.M.) by creating a new junior leadership post for his challenger, Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.).\n\nFormer Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) said Pelosi has a savvy understanding of what it takes to win high-stakes leadership elections, especially in an era in which institutional power is diminished.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Sam Rayburn\u2019s Congress, where speakers could personally and institutionally intimidate people,\u201d he said, referring to the Texas Democrat who was the longest-serving House speaker. \u201cShe is doing exactly what she needs to do, whether it\u2019s inventing 16 meaningless titles so everybody can get something, or when people ask for a seat at the table, just building a bigger table.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no move was so crippling to her opponents as the deal she struck with Fudge, a blunt former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus who had allied herself with Moulton and Ryan and openly pondered running against Pelosi.\n\nFudge said in an interview a week ago that she was not interested in a deal and questioned Pelosi\u2019s commitment to diversity. \u201cNobody wants the status quo,\u201d she said.\n\nThe next day, Fudge spent 40 minutes in Pelosi\u2019s office in a meeting brokered by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), a respected elder statesman close to both women. When Fudge emerged, her remarks had lost their edge.\n\nShe told reporters that Pelosi was a \u201cvery, very good leader\u201d and said the conversation \u201cwent a long way in trying to find some way that we can unify this caucus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the leader had to do was explain that she\u2019d need to raise $135 million in a presidential cycle, which would require being on the road every day you\u2019re not in session,\u201d said former congresswoman Donna F. Edwards, a former Congressional Black Caucus member who has spoken out on Pelosi\u2019s behalf in recent days. \u201cYou\u2019d also need to pass a legislative agenda that makes sure everyone\u2019s priorities are met so they can run on something for reelection. And you\u2019re going to have to negotiate with [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell in the Senate.\u201d\n\nFudge folded Tuesday, agreeing to back Pelosi after securing a verbal commitment to give African American women a more prominent role in leadership decision-making and to award her the chairmanship of a subcommittee on elections \u2014 a post that stands to give Fudge a unique pulpit on voting rights issues.\n\nHiggins underwent a similar transformation. In an interview last week, he said Pelosi was \u201cendangering our majority\u201d by holding on to power and that a suitable alternative would emerge if she couldn\u2019t win the necessary votes. But on Wednesday, Higgins said someone who won the speakership under those circumstances would be \u201cundeserving.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to be speaker, you\u2019ve got to stand up and you\u2019ve got to fight for it \u2014 period, the end,\u201d he said.\n\nHiggins said assurances of a \u201cserious good-faith effort\u201d to advance legislation allowing Americans as young as 50 to purchase Medicare coverage helped persuade him, as well as a renewed commitment to a vast infrastructure spending bill. The deal, he said, was brokered over four days of phone calls with not only Pelosi, but also with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), the incoming Ways and Means Committee chairman.\n\nKhanna recalled a meeting with Pelosi in late 2012, when he was pondering a run against longtime Democratic Rep. Mike Honda in a district in Pelosi\u2019s Bay Area backyard.\n\nPelosi invited him to her San Francisco home where she quickly said that she would stand by Honda. But, Khanna said, she suggested as he left that she would hold no grudge if he ran.\n\n\u201cIf I had waited around, I would never have been speaker,\u201d he recalled her saying. \u201cPower is never given; it\u2019s always taken.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Wife of academic jailed in UAE condemns actions of UK", "description": "The wife of a British academic sentenced to life in prison for espionage in the United Arab Emirates has condemned the U.K. government for putting diplomatic relations ahead of an innocent man's freedom.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/wife-of-academic-jailed-in-uae-condemns-actions-of-uk/2018/11/22/5d48c210-ee45-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T10:57:12Z", "content": "LONDON The wife of a British academic sentenced to life in prison for espionage in the United Arab Emirates has condemned the U.K. government for putting diplomatic relations ahead of an innocent mans freedom.

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt expressed shock at the verdict Wednesday Nov. 21, 2018 and has travelled to the UAE to make representations on his behalf. (Daniela Tejada via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 The wife of a British academic sentenced to life in prison for espionage in the United Arab Emirates said Britain\u2019s foreign secretary assured her Thursday that the government was now working to get him out of jail after months of inaction to gain his freedom.\n\nDaniela Tejada had earlier told the BBC that Foreign Office officials bungled the case of her husband, 31-year-old Ph.D. student Matthew Hedges, who was arrested May 5 at Dubai Airport after a research trip to the UAE. But after emerging from her meeting with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, she said authorities pledged to \u201creturn him home to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has assured me that he and his team are doing everything in their power to get Matt free and return him home to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not a fight I can win alone and I thank the Foreign Office and the British public for now standing up for one of their citizens.\u201d\n\nTejada has become her husband\u2019s primary advocate, turning up the pressure on the government to act. She told the BBC earlier in the day that the government had failed to robustly intervene on Hedges\u2019 behalf during the early stages of his imprisonment, when he was held in solitary confinement under inhumane conditions.\n\n\u201cI was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen\u2019s rightful freedom and his welfare,\u201d Tejada said. \u201cThey were stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance.\u201d\n\nThe verdict, announced Wednesday after a five-minute hearing, caught the British government off guard. Hunt issued a statement saying he had discussed the case with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed during a visit to the country last week and the verdict \u201cruns contrary to earlier assurances.\u201d\n\nHunt said he was \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d by the verdict, which \u201cis not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nTensions over Hedges\u2019 treatment have quickly escalated into a crisis, in part because ties between Britain and the seven emirates of the UAE are considered close and date back 200 years.\n\nThe UAE is strategically located on the east coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and the British military trains with UAE troops. The emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai are home to large numbers of British nationals who work in areas ranging from finance to sports, and thousands of tourists visit the country each year, attracted by sunny beaches, luxury hotels and theme parks.\n\nTies also include lucrative defense contracts. U.K. companies have a backlog of orders with the UAE worth more than $261 million over the coming decade, according to data from IHS Markit. More importantly, the UAE plans to award another $20 billion of arms contracts over the coming decade \u2014 a significant source of potential revenue for Britain, which is set to leave the European Union next year and is seeking to expand trade elsewhere.\n\nHedges traveled to the UAE to conduct interviews as part of his research into civil-military relations after the Arab Spring. There was \u201cnothing clandestine or covert\u201d in anything he was doing, according to Clive Jones, his Ph.D. supervisor.\n\nThe Muslim nation prides itself on being tolerant of foreigners. But British nationals often run afoul of local customs and laws, which prohibit public intoxication, kissing in public and cursing. Most of the time, the violators are deported.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s vast surveillance network has been used to go after critics, journalists and activists conducting research in sensitive areas. Human rights organizations have been barred from the country after researching the conditions of migrant laborers who do the back-breaking construction work behind the glittering high-rise towers and sprawling shopping malls.\n\nAndreas Krieg, a military and security expert at King\u2019s College London, said the UAE sees any information that isn\u2019t state-controlled a threat to the regime.\n\nThe Hedges sentence was meant to send a message to journalists, rights advocates and academics to take the government line or face the consequences, Krieg said.\n\n\u201cThey see civil society as a threat to security,\u201d he said, adding that the idea runs contrary to the well-oiled publicity machine that sells the UAE as an attractive investment and tourist attraction. \u201cThis is going to be a stain for years and years unless they release him.\u201d\n\nTejada said it had been a horrible time for her husband. As she read a prepared statement outside the Foreign Office, she recalled his shock as the verdict was read.\n\n\u201cSeeing him shaking in court after being handed a life sentence and then being made to leave was beyond heartbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even get to say goodbye.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He later told investigators that he also killed patients in Oldenburg.\n\nAuthorities subsequently investigated hundreds of deaths, exhuming bodies of former patients.\n\nThe Oldenburg state court is conducting the trial at a courtroom set up in a conference center, a venue chosen to accommodate the large public interest in the proceedings and the many co-plaintiffs.\n\nHoegel told the court last month that he had a \u201cprotected\u201d childhood, free of violence. He said his grandmother and his father, who were both nurses, had been his role models for going into the profession.\n\nAn additional conviction could affect Hoegel\u2019s possibility of parole, but there are no consecutive sentences in Germany. In general, people serving life sentences are considered for parole after 15 years.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to last until May.\n\nPolice have said that, if local health officials hadn\u2019t hesitated in alerting authorities, Hoegel could have been stopped earlier.\n\nAuthorities are pursuing criminal cases against former staff at the two medical facilities.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Ko Bum-jun/Newsis via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A South Korean pastor was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Thursday for raping or sexually molesting eight female followers who believed he was God.\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court said that Lee Jae-rock of the Seoul-based Manmin Central Church was convicted of abusing the women \u201chabitually\u201d for an extended period.\n\nA court statement said the victims had \u201cabsolute belief in Lee\u2019s religious authority\u201d and thought they could go to heaven if they obeyed his order.\n\nThe court said that Lee had denied all the charges against him. But it said the women \u201ctestified about details that cannot be cooked up if they hadn\u2019t experienced them personally.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s church later Thursday said it will make best efforts to gather evidence to prove Lee\u2019s innocence. \u201cWe\u2019ll immediately appeal to tell the truth about (Lee) because we believe his innocence,\u201d a church statement said.\n\nBoth Lee and prosecutors have one week to appeal.\n\nSome of the eight women gave their accounts about Lee\u2019s abuses in a series of programs by local JTBC television network in April. They described how Lee summoned each of them to his apartment at night and raped them by telling them they were improving their chances to go to heaven. Their names were not disclosed and faces obscured.\n\n\u201c(He) said he was a holy and righteous man and would choose me to go to the new Jerusalem,\u201d said one victim.\n\nAnother victim told the network that Lee demanded she take contraceptives before coming to his house. A third victim said Lee instructed her to pay only in cash for the cab ride she took to get to his house, apparently out of concerns of leaving any credit-card records.\n\n\u201c(He said) other kids were taking pills before coming and I should too,\u201d the second woman said. \u201c(He said) heaven was a place where everyone was clean and didn\u2019t feel shame or lust even if they were naked.\u201d\n\nLee, reportedly 75, set up his church in Seoul\u2019s formerly blue-collar Guro neighborhood in 1982. It has more than 135,000 followers, according to the church\u2019s website, which is also filled with claims of Lee\u2019s miracle cures through prayer. Mainstream churches in South Korea have described Lee\u2019s church as a cult.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

May plans to meet Thursday with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country holds the rotating European Unio\u2026 [+664 chars]", "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Theresa May faced wide-ranging criticism from skeptical lawmakers Thursday as she sought to portray a draft agreement on a post-Brexit relationship with the European Union as a \u201cgood deal for our country.\u201d\n\nAddressing the House of Commons after the publication of a 26-page draft political declaration with the EU on post-Brexit relations, May said the agreement will ensure a \u201csmooth and orderly\u201d British departure from the European Union. Britain officially leaves the 28-nation EU \u2014 the first country to ever do so \u2014 on March 29.\n\n\u201cThe draft text that we have agreed with the (European) Commission is a good deal for our country and for our partners in the EU,\u201d May said.\n\nMay is due to travel to Brussels on Saturday for further Brexit meetings, including with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a day before a summit of the EU\u2019s 27 other leaders at which both the political declaration on post-Brexit relations as well as the divorce agreement, which alone has legal status, are expected to be formally signed off.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement needs to be sealed soon to leave enough time for the European Parliament and the U.K. Parliament to endorse it.\n\nMay told lawmakers that the outlines for the future help protect jobs, end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the U.K., give British fishermen more control and avoid the return of a hard border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.\n\nShe also said the agreement paves the way for a free trade agreement with the bloc as well as allowing Britain to forge new trade deals around the world.\n\nBut her rosy predictions met with resistance on many fronts in Parliament, which is expected to vote on the Brexit plan next month.\n\nAt the moment, it looks precarious for the prime minister given the number of lawmakers who have expressed discontent with the proposals, notably the 585-page legal treaty that deals with the terms of Britain\u2019s departure, including what the country owes the EU.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain\u2019s main opposition Labour Party, poured scorn on the agreement on future relations, describing it a \u201c26 pages of waffle\u201d that represented a failure of the Conservative Party and May during two years of negotiations.\n\nCorbyn said the agreement \u201crepresents the worst of all worlds\u201d and that Britain will have \u201cno say\u201d over EU rules that will continue to apply in Britain.\n\n\u201cThis is the blindfold Brexit we all feared,\u201d he said. \u201cA leap into the dark.\u201d\n\nMay is likely to need some Labour lawmakers to back her plan if she has realistic hopes of winning approval, given that her Conservative Party does not enjoy a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nMay also faced criticism from hard-line Conservative Party Brexiteers, notably Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, and from others who pressed May to back a second referendum on the whole Brexit proposition.\n\nIf May fails to get a majority in Parliament, it\u2019s unclear what would then happen. Some lawmakers argue that the country would end up crashing out of the EU on Brexit day with no deal, a scenario that could see tariffs slapped on exports and restrictions imposed on workers. Others hope Parliament could back a second referendum in the hope the public would call the whole thing off.\n\nThe political declaration was agreed upon at a technical level by negotiators and endorsed Thursday by the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, which is overseeing Brexit negotiations.\n\n\u201cThis declaration establishes the parameters of an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation, law enforcement and criminal justice, foreign policy, security and defense and wider areas of cooperation,\u201d according to the document.\n\nIt also talks about the close ties that have been cemented after 45 years of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU and notes that the \u201cparties envisage having a trading relationship on goods that is as close as possible, with a view to facilitating the ease of legitimate trade.\u201d\n\nIn a speech in Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel underlined that \u201cBritain should remain a partner, remain a friend\u201d but she underscored the difficulties that may arise in any attempt to keep services seamless.\n\n\u201cWe have to say honestly that, in the services sector, we don\u2019t have a great deal of experience with international free trade agreements,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut we want to see that as a future relationship.\u201d\n\nOne stumbling block relates to Gibraltar, the tiny territory at the tip of the Iberian Peninsula that was ceded to Britain in 1713 but is still claimed by Spain.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said earlier this week that his government \u201ccannot accept\u201d Gibraltar\u2019s future being determined by negotiations at the EU level.\n\nMay said Thursday that she has spoken with Sanchez and that she is \u201cconfident\u201d there will be a resolution on Sunday \u201cthat delivers for the whole U.K. family, including Gibraltar.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCook reported from Brussels.

Jokanovic sent out Fulham to play in an expansive and open style that allowed them to be picked off with ease. He never fielded the same back four.\n\nNo wonder Ranieri said his priority was to sort out the defense and finally keep clean sheets, with the reward for the players a trip to fast-food chain McDonald\u2019s for burgers. Famously, pizzas were his gift to Leicester\u2019s squad for shutouts.\n\n\u201cToday I said this: Restart every time,\u201d Ranieri said Thursday. \u201cWe can win, lose, clean and restart tomorrow. Forget the past.\u201d\n\nCompared with masterminding a title success for Leicester over the superpowers of the league, keeping Fulham up should be child\u2019s play for the 67-year-old Ranieri.\n\nFulham, after all, is only three points from safety. It has 26 games left to play. It has a squad containing more than 100 million pounds ($113m) worth of new talent bought in the offseason. In theory, there are at least three rival teams less equipped to stay up.\n\n\u201cThis Fulham squad has exceptional talent that is contrary to its position in the table,\u201d Ranieri said.\n\nHe could hardly have a kinder first match either, a home game against a Southampton side that has failed to score in half of its league games and has only one victory.\n\nRanieri needs to settle on a goalkeeper \u2014 Jokanovic played three in 12 games \u2014 and a fixed back four. He also requires a central midfield combination that provides better protection for his defense and must get more out of 18-year-old Ryan Sessegnon, who was Fulham\u2019s standout in the second-tier Championship when playing on the left wing but has sometimes featured at left back this season.\n\nIn attack, can Aleksandar Mitrovic and Andre Schuerrle be Fulham\u2019s version of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, Leicester\u2019s attacking pair that excelled under Ranieri? The combinations have different profiles \u2014 where Vardy had sheer pace, Mitrovic has presence and strength; where Mahrez was all about touch and technique, Schuerrle has a lethal shot and an eye for goal \u2014 but their importance is similar.\n\nCan the coach once nicknamed \u201cThe Tinkerman\u201d when in charge of Chelsea provide some stability at Fulham?\n\n\u201cI am Tinkerman,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I tinker clever. It\u2019s important to maintain the same lineup for some matches but you never know. I want everybody available and then I can choose.\u201d\n\nRanieri must also instill a new mindset.\n\n\u201cI think now it is important to not think about miracles, but think about a lot of battles and be ready together,\u201d he said. \u201cI repeat, together. The club, the players, the fans.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The last time electoral support for Putin dropped below 60 percent, according to similar Levada surveys, was in 2013.\n\nPutin, who has been ruling Russia since 2000, was re-elected for another six-year term in March. Unpopular changes to the pension system announced earlier this year have dented his popularity, while euphoria over the widely popular 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula has waned.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Martial Trezzini/Keystone via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nGENEVA \u2014 A top U.N. scientist on Thursday shrugged off an online quip from U.S. President Donald Trump that questioned global warming, saying a U.S. government report will show the \u201cfundamental impacts of climate change on the U.S. continent.\u201d\n\nOfficials at the World Meteorological Organization also said environmentally minded efforts by the state of California, in parts of the financial sector, among grassroots activists and others will have more of an impact to help the fight against climate change than \u201cpolitical disturbance\u201d and \u201cdiscourse\u201d will impede it.\n\nThe science, they said, will have the last word.\n\nSome of that science comes Friday in a new U.S. federal climate change assessment report, from agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Energy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting what you will see tomorrow,\u201d said Pavel Kabat, WMO\u2019s chief scientist. \u201cThat is a major report coming supported by all agencies ... under the administration of President Trump ranging from NOAA to NASA, from NASA to DOE, showing the fundamental impacts of climate change on the U.S. continent.\u201d\n\nKabat was speaking at a news conference to present WMO\u2019s latest greenhouse gas bulletin, which said levels in the atmosphere climbed to a record last year. In a statement, WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas warned \u201cthe window of opportunity\u201d to act against climate change has nearly closed.\n\nWMO says globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide reached 405.5 parts per million in 2017, up slightly from the previous year and from 400.1 in 2015. Concentrations of other heat-trapping gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, also rose.\n\nThe findings come ahead of next month\u2019s meeting of world leaders in Katowice, Poland, for the annual global climate summit where they hope to find ways to implement the 2015 Paris climate accord that aims to keep global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, which lies about 2,000 kilometers northeast of Australia, is one of those countries already suffering severe effects of climate change.\n\nIts foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said his government is exploring the possibility of suing fossil fuel companies responsible for most man-made greenhouse gas emissions over the damage they have caused.\n\n\u201cBy hiding what they knew and misrepresenting the dangers of unabated fossil fuel use, the fossil fuel industry and supportive governments protected their high-emissions profits and obstructed the changes needed to prevent or at least minimize the impacts of climate change,\u201d he told a \u2018virtual\u2019 summit of nations that are vulnerable to climate change.\n\nWMO\u2019s Taalas said the last time Earth had such high levels of carbon dioxide concentration was 3-5 million years ago.\n\nWithout cuts in greenhouse gases, Taalas said, \u201cclimate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth.\u201d\n\nThat came just hours after Trump, who once called global warming a \u201choax\u201d and has pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, floated a new question about climate change on Twitter: \u201cBrutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?\u201d\n\nDespite that, Kabat cited a \u201cglobal transformation\u201d underway in thinking about global warming, saying \u201cthe point of no return has been passed.\u201d He said efforts by some industries, in civil society and by local officials could \u201covertake\u201d governmental agreements or statements on the issue.\n\n\u201cI think on the longer timescale we are not that much worried about the current political disturbance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDespite the statements of President Trump, there is still a very concrete and specific movement by the agencies under the administration to actually make the case of action against climate change,\u201d Kabat said.\n\n___\n\nFrank Jordans contributed from Berlin.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Their target was Zhou Chen, an environmental reporter for Caixin, one of China\u2019s most respected business media groups. She was on a reporting trip to Quanzhou, a city in southeastern China\u2019s Fujian province, to investigate a petrochemical leak that sickened more than 50 people.\n\nJournalists in China are regularly tailed and harassed by local authorities, but few Chinese reporters publicly discuss the details. Zhou broke the silence about her harassment in an article published this week, prompting an outcry on social media and a rare apology from the police.\n\nReporters Without Borders ranks China 176 out of 180 in its World Press Freedom Index and says more than 50 journalists and bloggers are detained \u201cin conditions that pose a threat to their lives.\u201d China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is eager to suppress information that might contribute to social instability, while local officials often try to interfere with reporting on sensitive topics.\n\nOn Nov. 4, around 7 tons of the petroleum derivative C9 leaked into the sea off Quanzhou. Dozens of residents fell sick, and scores of fish died. Local residents complained that officials mishandled the cleanup and tried to cover up the extent of the damage.\n\nZhou went to investigate. On Nov. 11, after a long day of reporting, she was in bed, in her pajamas, looking at her phone when she heard a keycard unlocking the door of her hotel room. It was 11:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cYou barged in like this when I\u2019m not even properly dressed,\u201d Zhou shouts in the video. \u201cCould you please leave immediately?\u201d\n\nThe men demanded her ID. They did a cursory search of the room, flipping the curtains back and forth, and warned her to watch out for her safety.\n\nZhou\u2019s account of her terrifying night was published Monday in Caixin Weekly, part of the Caixin Media group. The police search capped a day of bullying, according to her article. She wrote that she had been blocked from taking photos by people wearing body cameras and tailed as a mother and daughter took her to see dead fish floating in their family fish farm.\n\nAccording to Zhou, the police didn\u2019t show her any documents authorizing their late-night search, as required by Chinese law. Hotels in China must register their guests\u2019 information with the police, and a hotel receptionist later told Zhou that the police had asked for her room card specifically.\n\n\u201cI finally have seen firsthand how lawless and unscrupulous the abuse of official power can be,\u201d she wrote. After the men left her room, she wrote that she sat for some time \u201cin a frightened daze.\u201d\n\nBoth Caixin and Zhou declined to comment.\n\nOther journalists rushed to support Zhou. Liang Yingfei, also a reporter at Caixin, wrote in a Tuesday blog post that she too had faced interference in the past. \u201cReporters being \u2018accompanied\u2019 as they work seems to have become the new normal,\u201d she wrote.\n\nA commentator for CCTV state television, Lei Mu, jumped in, writing that \u201cthe public has the right to know the truth\u201d about the chemical leak in Fujian. \u201cDamage to the credibility of the party and government organs caused by abuse of public power sometimes is far more profound than that caused by an accident.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Quanzhou police issued an apology and said one district police officer had been suspended.\n\n\u201cWe have verified that the situation reflected by Comrade Zhou Chen is basically true,\u201d said the statement, which was published on a local Communist Party-run website. \u201cWe sincerely apologize for this!\u201d\n\nOn social media, questions still swirled about who had authorized the search and whether the officer who was suspended was taking a fall for just following orders.\n\nThe Quanzhou police could not be reached for comment.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Chen Si in Shanghai contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kinetz on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/ekinetz\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Aaron Favila, File/Associated Press)\n\nBANGKOK \u2014 All the usual rituals of international summits were there: the group photos, the gala dinners, the noticeably vibrant shirts leaders force themselves into. But eclipsing all of that at Asia\u2019s two big meetings was some unusually forthright criticism that exposed deepening divisions rattling the region.\n\nFront and center was the rivalry between the U.S. and China. The two countries are locked in a widening trade war and their representatives used the summits to exchange barbs and maneuver to expand their influence.\n\nCompetition between the great powers is not new to the region. But over decades of war, financial crises and other setbacks, countries across Asia and the Pacific Rim have used these annual meetings to talk through such problems, usually opting to sideline disagreements in a show of unity. Consensus, not conflict, is typically the norm.\n\nThis year is different.\n\nThe clash between the world\u2019s two biggest economies is shaking the bedrock of regional amity and leaving some countries worried they will be forced to choose between Beijing and Washington. It also may bode poorly for compromise between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping when they meet this month at the Group of 20 gathering in Argentina.\n\nThe antagonisms kicked off last week at a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore, where U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, standing in for Trump, declared that \u201cempire and aggression have no place\u201d in the region, a clear reference to Chinese expansion in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe discord carried over to the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Papua New Guinea, where leaders failed for the first time in nearly 30 years of such gatherings to endorse a final joint statement. China apparently pushed back hard against U.S. demands for strong language against unfair trade practices.\n\nPence and Chinese leaders sparred at both summits, with the vice president describing China\u2019s militarization and expansion in the South China Sea as \u201cillegal and dangerous.\u201d He accused Beijing of threatening the sovereignty of many nations and said it \u201cendangers the prosperity of the world.\u201d\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang smacked back, urging fellow leaders to send a positive message to markets ruffled by the trade war, which has seen both sides imposing punitive tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s exports and has the potential to unravel supply chains across the globe.\n\nThe acrimony may be somewhat less apparent at the G-20 gathering in Buenos Aeries, which will include leaders from across the globe and the focus will be global, not regional.\n\nBut the strains between the U.S. and China were painful enough in Singapore that the gathering\u2019s urbane host, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, appealed for a bit less candor and greater camaraderie, saying it would be easier if everybody was \u201con the same side.\u201d\n\nAcross Asia, countries worry they will have to \u201cchoose one or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it does not happen soon.\u201d\n\nMost Asian nations are loath to make such a choice because they benefit from the rivalry, whether economically, militarily or both. For most, China is their largest trading partner. But they are wary of China\u2019s military might and see the U.S. and its presence in the region as a welcome counterbalance.\n\nChina\u2019s footprint was everywhere in the Papuan capital, Port Moresby, from a showpiece boulevard and international convention center built with Chinese help to bus stop shelters sporting \u201cChina Aid\u201d plaques. A huge billboard showed Xi gazing beneficently beside Papua New Guinea\u2019s leader.\n\nAt that meeting, Pence took aim at China\u2019s global infrastructure drive, known as the \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d suggesting that Beijing was drowning its partners in debt and infringing on their sovereignty.\n\nHe also announced the U.S. would join ally Australia\u2019s plan to develop a naval base in Papua New Guinea. That followed a hush-hush working level meeting in Singapore of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which involves the U.S., Japan, Australia and India and is viewed as a challenge to China\u2019s expanding military reach.\n\nXi, the Chinese president, suggested the U.S. was bending the rules of global institutions set up after World War II, such as the World Trade Organization, and using them for \u201cselfish agendas.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s friction wasn\u2019t confined to jousting between the U.S. and China.\n\nIn Singapore, Myanmar\u2019s leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who usually is not put on the spot by the other leaders, appeared grim and weary after she was sharply criticized by Pence and by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed over the Buddhist majority-nation\u2019s treatment of ethnic Muslim Rohingya. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled killings and other violence in Myanmar and are crowded in dire conditions in camps in Bangladesh.\n\nTrue to form, China saw an opportunity and responded to the criticism by having Li reach out and reaffirm Beijing\u2019s support for Myanmar\u2019s efforts to maintain domestic stability.\n\nAs China and the U.S. maneuver for influence across a region stretching from India to the tip of South America, the biggest worry is that the jousting could escalate into a full-blown confrontation as Chinese and U.S. warships and aircraft prowl the region. A near collision of a Chinese destroyer and the USS Decatur near a disputed reef in the South China Sea in late September added to those concerns.\n\nStill, the jostling for supremacy comes with mixed signals.\n\nThe regional summitry over, two U.S. B-52 bombers on Monday flew over the South China Sea in what U.S. Pacific Air Forces said was a \u201croutine training mission.\u201d But on Wednesday, the aircraft carrier USS Reagan docked in Hong Kong in what was viewed as a friendly gesture \u2014 it required Beijing\u2019s approval.\n\n___\n\nElaine Kurtenbach is the Asia business editor for AP and has reported from across the region since 1987.\n\nAn AP News Analysis\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

No other politicians take an interest in how to defend our home.\u201d\n\nNeglected, working-class suburbs and rural areas with high unemployment are where the Euroskeptic, anti-feminist and staunchly patriotic party is trying to enlist support that could lift it out of the shadows in a country that has been slow to embrace the extreme right.\n\nThe last far-right Spanish lawmaker lost his seat in parliament in 1982. Academics have attributed their absence since then to painful memories of the country\u2019s long right-wing dictatorship and the prominence of the conservative Popular Party across all the political space from center to right. Only more recently has the PP ceded ground to the Citizens party, a new center-right group that surged in popularity as an opposition to regionalist parties in Catalonia and other areas.\n\nBut some saw that barrier falling when Vox garnered a 1.4-percent share of votes in official polls last month, setting the four-year-old party on track to enter the lower house of parliament in general elections due before 2020.\n\n\u201cEven one seat would be enough to use it as a platform for our message to reach all Spaniards,\u201d Vox President Santiago Abascal told The Associated Press, outlining a plan to use a regional Andalusian election in 10 days\u2019 time and the European Parliament ballot in May next year as stepping stones.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as the glass ceiling that many place upon us by saying we are on the fringes or political extremists,\u201d the 42-year-old Abascal added defiantly. \u201cWe just defend what many families are discussing at the table but has become politically incorrect in the political arena.\u201d\n\nThe scion of a family targeted by the separatist militant group ETA in his native Basque region, Abascal refuses to waste time fending off criticism that he is a fascist, racist, fear-monger or far-right populist, all of which he dismisses as attempts to stigmatize his movement.\n\nVox politicians are frequently ridiculed by mainstream media for their defense of everything Spanish, from bullfighting to the monarchy, and nostalgia for historical events \u2014 such as the 15th-century ousting of Muslims from the Kingdom of Castile and the colonization of the American continent.\n\nSpeaking in Murcia to a packed auditorium of some 1,500 sympathizers, Abascal went one step further, urging \u201crich Arabic countries\u201d to take in Muslim migrants \u201cwho think like them and want to impose Islamic law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will stand against them coming here to tell us that in our schools we can\u2019t eat ham,\u201d Abascal said, eliciting wide applause from the audience. Outside, police dispersed protesters waving rainbow flags and signs supporting gender equality.\n\nSpain\u2019s foreign population, which started growing at the turn of the century, now makes up 10 percent of the 46.7 million residents, with Moroccan, Romanian and British nationals topping the list.\n\nMuch like other populist leaders, Abascal proposes a weaker European Union where migration is controlled \u201caccording to national economic interests and cultural proximity,\u201d which draws him to rule out \u201cMuslims who don\u2019t blend well with Europe\u2019s Judeo-Christian values.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the liberal-minded leftists already do it in their mansions. They first look through the peephole before opening the door,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to do the same in what is Spanish people\u2019s private property: our country.\u201d\n\nA 100-issue party manifesto begins by stating that the northeastern Catalonia region should lose its self-government after last year\u2019s attempt to split from Spain and that separatist parties should be outlawed. Vox also advocates changing laws on domestic violence and restricting abortion.\n\nBut their two flagship issues, a stronger hand on migration and the defense of Spain\u2019s unity, could also be Vox\u2019s main obstacle as it tries to grab a foothold, said Carmen Gonzalez, a researcher with the Elcano Royal Institute, an official think tank.\n\n\u201cThese are policy proposals that other mainstream parties are already ready to execute,\u201d says Gonzalez, adding that polls show corruption, inequality and the future of pensions worry Spaniards more than migration does. \u201cStatistically speaking, the real source of votes in Spain is in the center.\u201d\n\nReporting about Vox has picked up in the media, however, and the party\u2019s propagandists have been skilled enough to magnify that attention using social media and messaging apps to stir debate and reach new constituents.\n\nIn a widely shared video last week, Abascal and a well-known bullfighter rode horses, accompanied an epic soundtrack. Some party leaders also earned fame two years ago by swimming back to Spain to escape arrest in the disputed British overseas territory of Gibraltar after raising a Spanish flag.\n\nOne of those, Vox\u2019s secretary general Javier Ortega, acted as a prosecuting lawyer in the judicial probe against the Catalans who organized an illegal independence referendum in October 2017.\n\nThat presence in the public sphere has helped earn Vox more than 16,000 paying members. Last week\u2019s rally sold out in Murcia, where Abascal\u2019s previous visit drew only enough people to fill the outdoor space of a coffee house.\n\nThe party says it has received separate invitations from the Europe of Nations and Freedom, the smallest group in the European Parliament, and the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe, linked to the Republican Party in the United States.\n\nBut the party is finding it difficult to connect with other European peers because some of them have expressed sympathy for Catalan separatists, a no-go zone for Vox.\n\nNotes have been compared with Steve Bannon, but Abascal also doesn\u2019t plan for now to join the wide coalition of Euroskeptic movements led by the former White House adviser \u2014 even though U.S. President Donald J. Trump inspired the \u201cMake Spain great again\u201d slogan used by Vox in early campaigning.\n\n\u201cOur references are not international, because the issues that we fight for are national,\u201d said Abascal, who also is not concerned about voter mood changes over parties like his.\n\n\u201cMovements like ours,\u201d he said, \u201care going to become permanent in Western societies.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But suddenly, it started moving a little too fast for comfort.\n\nIt started to get \u201cbumpy,\u201d like an incoming flight to Chicago, a Northwestern University law student who was in the elevator told the Chicago Tribune. It whizzed past all the usual stops, falling and falling and falling 84 floors before coming to an abrupt stop somewhere between the 11th and the 12th.\n\nThen came the noise: \u201cClack clack clack clack.\u201d\n\nThen came the dust and dirt, floating into the elevator from the ceiling.\n\nAnd then came the panic.\n\nThe strangers started \u201cfreaking out,\u201d the law student, who declined to be identified, told the Tribune. Some were screaming, others crying. Montemayor, who was visiting with his wife from Mexico City, said he and his wife held each other tightly and began to pray.\n\n\u201cI believed we were going to die,\u201d Montemayor told CBS. \u201cWe were going down, and then I felt that we were falling down, and then I heard a noise: clack clack clack clack\u201d \u2014 the sound of getting trapped in an elevator.\n\nThey pressed the emergency button. The six strangers \u2014 including Montemayor and his wife, two law students from Northwestern and two others, including a pregnant woman \u2014 were stuck in the elevator for roughly 2\u00bd hours as firefighters tried to figure out a way to reach them.\n\nThe problem? They were trapped in a \u201cblind shaft,\u201d meaning there were no doors through which firefighters could enter the shaft and get to them, Chicago Fire Department Battalion Chief Patrick Maloney told reporters at the scene, according to ABC 7 Chicago. The malfunction had been caused by a snapped \u201choist rope,\u201d or elevator cable, Maloney said. Other cables were still attached, keeping the elevator from plummeting to the floor.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty precarious situation where the cables that broke were on top of the elevator,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do an elevator-to-elevator rescue. We had to breach a wall on the 11th floor of the parking garage in order to open up the elevator doors.\u201d\n\nLuis Vazquez, a friend of the Montemayors who took a different elevator to the ground floor, told the Tribune that he couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.\n\n\u201cThis is the second most important building in Chicago? And this is the third most important city in the United States?\u201d he questioned. \u201cIn the 98 floors, they have no place to open any door? That is the craziest thing.\u201d\n\nFinally, the firefighters busted through the brick wall of the parking garage, creating a 5-by-5-foot hole through which they could see the top half of the elevator.\n\nFrom inside, the trapped group could hear the firefighters drilling their way in. One of the law students captured the moment on video as a bizarre liquid oozed from the elevator door\u2019s crevice and firefighters worked to pry open the doors.\n\nFinally, just before 3 a.m., they were rescued.

(Gautam Singh, File/Associated Press)\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 For thousands of years, the people of North Sentinel island have been isolated from the rest of the world.\n\nThey use spears and bows and arrows to hunt the animals that roam the small, heavily forested island, and gather plants to eat and to fashion into homes. Their closest neighbors live more than 50 kilometers (30 miles) away. Deeply suspicious of outsiders, they attack anyone who comes through the surf and onto their beaches.\n\nPolice say that is what happened last week when a young American, John Allen Chau, was killed by islanders after paying fishermen to take him to the island.\n\n\u201cThe Sentinelese want to be left alone,\u201d said the anthropologist Anup Kapur.\n\nScholars believe the Sentinelese migrated from Africa roughly 50,000 years ago, but most details of their lives remain completely unknown.\n\n\u201cWe do not even know how many of them are there,\u201d said Anvita Abbi, who has spent decades studying the tribal languages of India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar islands. North Sentinel is an outpost of the island chain, which is far closer to Myanmar and Thailand than to mainland India. Estimates on the group\u2019s size range from a few dozen to a few hundred.\n\n\u201cWhat language they speak, how old it is, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess,\u201d Abbi said. \u201cNobody has access to these people.\u201d\n\nAnd, she said, that is how it should be.\n\n\u201cJust for our curiosity, why should we disturb a tribe that has sustained itself for tens of thousands of years?\u201d she asked. \u201cSo much is lost: People are lost, language is lost, their peace is lost.\u201d\n\nFor generations, Indian officials have heavily restricted visits to North Sentinel, with contact limited to rare \u201cgift-giving\u201d encounters, with small teams of officials and scientists leaving coconuts and bananas for the islanders.\n\nAny contact with such isolated people can be dangerous, scholars say, with islanders having no resistance to diseases outsiders carry.\n\n\u201cWe have become a very dangerous people,\u201d said P.C. Joshi, an anthropology professor at Delhi University. \u201cEven minor influences can kill them.\u201d\n\nBecause of this, Abbi said scholars who visit isolated peoples are careful to limit their visits to a few hours a day and to stay away even if they have minor coughs or colds.\n\nMany of the island chain\u2019s other tribes have been decimated over the past century, lost to disease, intermarriage and migration.\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said Chau may have been encouraged by recent changes to Indian rules about visiting isolated islands in the Andamans.\n\nWhile special permissions are still required, visits are now theoretically allowed in some parts of the Andamans where they used to be entirely forbidden.\n\n\u201cThe authorities lifted one of the restrictions that had been protecting the Sentinelese tribe\u2019s island from foreign tourists, which sent exactly the wrong message, and may have contributed to this terrible event,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He also wants passed in the same session draft cybersecurity laws that would force global technology companies such as Facebook and Google to help police unscramble encrypted messages sent by criminals.\n\nRights advocates have raised privacy concerns about the cybersecurity bill which is currently being scrutinized by a parliamentary committee.\n\n\u201cPeople who commit acts of terrorism have rejected absolutely everything that this country stands for,\u201d Morrison told reporters.\n\nThe extremist threat to Australia was highlighted two weeks ago when a Somali-born Australian, whom police say was inspired by the Islamic State group, fatally stabbed one man and injured two others before police shot the assailant dead on a downtown Melbourne street.\n\nThis week, three Australian men of Turkish descent were charged with planning an Islamic State group-inspired mass-casualty attack in Melbourne which would likely have happened over the busy Christmas period. Police said the plot had been thwarted with the arrests.\n\nNine convicted extremists and Australians suspected to fighting with extremists overseas have had their Australian citizenships revoked since the government changed citizenship laws in 2015. The changes only apply to dual nationals so that losing Australian citizenship does not render a suspect stateless.\n\nThe proposed changes would further loosen the rules concerning the circumstances in which citizenship can be revoked. The amendments would do away with a requirement that a dual national convicted of a terrorism offense would need to be sentenced to at least six years in prison. The conviction itself would be enough to lose Australian citizenship.\n\nThe threshold for the government determining that an Australian was a dual national or entitled to citizenship of another country would also be lowered.\n\nMorrison said there would be \u201cno need to go around looking for paperwork\u201d to prove a second nationality.\n\nAustralia also plans to introduce a version of Britain\u2019s Temporary Exclusion Orders that were introduced in 2015 and can prevent British fighters from returning home from war zones for up to two years.\n\nUnder the Australian regime, Australian fighters who return home would have to comply with conditions such as reporting to police, curfews and restrictions on what technologies they can use.\n\nMorrison accepted that the Temporary Exclusion Orders legislation might not be passed into law until next year.\n\nMorrison\u2019s new drive against extremists has angered some Muslim community leaders.\n\nHe accused senior Muslim leaders on Wednesday of \u201ccontinuing down a path of denial\u201d after they refused an invitation to a meeting scheduled for Thursday to discuss the extremist threat.\n\nSome Australian Muslims were critical when Morrison said after the Somali-born Australian\u2019s rampage that \u201cradical, violent, extremist Islam\u201d posed the greatest threat to Australia\u2019s national security.\n\nThey felt the wider Muslim community had been blamed when Morrison said Islamic leaders \u201cmust be proactive, they must be alert and they must call this out.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Natacha Pisarenko/Associated Press)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 A headless Anibal Troilo, one of the tango\u2019s greatest performers, rests on a seat holding his concertina. Beside him, tango singer Alberto Castillo smiles, though he lacks arms.\n\nThe Argentine musical icons are in a hospital of a sort, where the 2,200 statues and monuments that dot Buenos Aires\u2019 parks and plazas are brought when they have suffered vandalism or decay.\n\nCity officials say about 20 pieces arrive each month \u2014 often dismembered, broken, sprayed with paint or stolen, either as collector\u2019s items or for scrap metal. Statues are sometimes damaged by angry protesters or toppled by people just for fun.\n\nAt the workshop, more than a dozen restorers repair stone and marble, clean away graffiti and mold missing appendages.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to have less of this and focus only on preservation of outdoor works, restorations that would be due to age, and not to damage done intentionally,\u201d said Jorge Grimaz, who coordinates operations at the city\u2019s Monuments and Artworks shop.\n\nThe abundance of statuary and monuments, many acquired in France at the beginning of the 20th century, helps set the Argentine capital and set it apart from other Latin American cities. Pollution and the humidity of the Argentine capital located on the banks of the Rio de la Plata, affects the sculptures. But vandalism is by far their worst enemy.\n\nThe attacks on sculptures have increased as frustration simmers over Argentina\u2019s economic crisis.\n\nA copy of Auguste Rodin\u2019s \u201cThe Thinker,\u201d located in the square in front of the Argentine Congress, has suffered the wrath of demonstrators who gather there to protest against politicians. The statue, cast in bronze from the original mold and signed by the French sculptor, was recently elevated on a pedestal to keep it away from the spray paint after a fence failed to safeguard it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of protests lately and the vandalism is on the rise,\u201d Grimaz said.\n\nEven a statue of Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi has been vandalized \u2014 twice. Last year, the bronze statue was first cut in half at the waist and later chopped off just above the ankles. A tennis racket was torn from the hands of a sculpture of Argentine tennis great Gabriela Sabatini in 2014.\n\nOther Argentine heroes and historical figures have suffered a similar fate.\n\nRevolutionary leader Martin Guemes was robbed of his bronze saber, so restorers at the workshop recently poured polyester resin into a rubber mold inside a plaster box to craft a replacement.\n\nThe shelves behind them held dozens of heads, hands and other appendages awaiting attachment to damaged monuments. The head of Chile\u2019s Nobel Prize-winning poet Pablo Neruda was covered on a stand near the head of former Argentine President Juan Peron.\n\nA monument to South American independence leader Simon Bolivar has been sprayed so many times with graffiti that restorers have to clean it every 15 days.\n\nThe bronze pieces in a reproduction of \u201cThe She-Wolf\u201d sculpture depicting the mythical founding of Rome, with Romulus and Remus, were stolen and have been replaced by polyester resin that has no resale value.\n\nThe marble horns of two deer in a marble statue of the goddess Diana were broken off by straining dogs that had been leashed to them.\n\nOnly one figure seems to be sacred and off limits to everyone: Mother Teresa. A sculpture of the patron saint of the Archdiocese of Calcutta stands at Lezama park in Buenos Aires.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never touched it,\u201d said Grimaz. \u201cMore than 10 years ago have passed and there\u2019s not a single work of art in that park that has not been at least stained with graffiti.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Redskins running back was made inactive for almost the entire 2014 season, when he was with the Vikings, amid a scandal over his treatment of his son, then four years old, that resulted in abuse charges.\n\nAccording to Master Tesfatsion, Peterson \u201cgenerally avoids\u201d using switches these days, and he quoted the 33-year-old back as saying that he eschews such punishment \u201cnine times out of 10.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Redskins' loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday, Peterson declined to comment on the article, a day after his agent released a statement saying that Peterson\u2019s trust \u201cwas violated\u201d by the interview.\n\nPeterson was indicted in September 2014 on felony child-abuse charges related to his use of a wooden switch on his son, and court records showed that the boy suffered cuts and bruising to his back, thighs and on one of his testicles. \u201cI truly regret this incident,\u201d Peterson said at the time, claiming that he loved his son and was trying to employ the same methods of discipline that he felt helped mold him effectively as he grew up in East Texas.\n\n[The nation\u2019s top running back recruit is changing positions. \u2018Smart guy,\u2019 says Adrian Peterson.]\n\nPeterson told The Washington Post\u2019s Les Carpenter in October that it \u201csucks\u201d to know he\u2019s still labeled by some as a child abuser, but he claimed, \u201cI\u2019m comfortable knowing that every time I go home, my boys run up to me and hug me and say, \u2018Hi, Dad.\u2019 And every time they want something, they know who to come to. They know who\u2019s going to be, \u2018Yes!\u2019 All my kids know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the face value [of the news reports] made people just go: \u2018How can you do this? You should go to jail,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know that when I spanked him he didn\u2019t move one muscle or drop one tear the entire time I was spanking him.\u201d\n\nIn November of 2014, the legal case was settled when the running back pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault, and he was put on a two-year probation, fined $4,000 and ordered to perform 80 hours of community service. He had been taken off the field since Week 1 and placed on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list, and he was subsequently suspended without pay for the final six games of that season, with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell saying in a letter to Peterson, \u201cYou have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen indicted,\u201d Goodell continued in the letter, \u201cyou acknowledged what you did but said that you would not \u2018eliminate whooping my kids\u2019 and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child\u2019s mother. You also said that you felt \u2018very confident with my actions because I know my intent.\u2019 These comments raise the serious concern that you do not fully appreciate the seriousness of your conduct, or even worse, that you may feel free to engage in similar conduct in the future.\u201d\n\nPeterson was reinstated in April 2015, presumably having met conditions laid out by Goodell\u2019s letter, which included Peterson committing to \u201ccounseling and rehabilitative effort, properly care for your children, and have no further violations of law or league policy.\u201d\n\nIn the Bleacher Report story, which places Peterson\u2019s career revival this season for Washington in the context of the 2014 scandal that shaped his image for many people, it is noted that he said to USA Today after his plea agreement, \u201cI won\u2019t ever use a switch again.\u201d Peterson told Tesfatsion, \u201cI understood that, hey, it was a mistake. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve regretted. It wasn\u2019t my intentions to do that. But it happened.\u201d\n\nHowever, the seven-time Pro Bowler also admitted that while he now disciplines his children in a variety of ways, including putting them in timeouts and taking away their electronics, he continues to employ corporal punishment.\n\n\u201cI had to discipline my son and spank him the other day with a belt,\u201d he told Tesfatsion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s different ways I discipline my kids,\u201d Peterson added. \u201cI didn\u2019t let that change me.\u201d\n\nIn response to the Bleacher Report story, Peterson\u2019s agent, Ron Slavin, issued a statement (via NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport) in which he claimed that \u201cAdrian\u2019s trust with this reporter was violated when he discussed what happened four years ago.\u201d\n\nSaying that \u201cBleacher Report approached the Washington Redskins and Adrian about doing a story about his resurgence on the field and his leadership in the locker room,\u201d Slavin asserted, \u201cAdrian learned several valuable lessons four years ago, thanks in part to his suspension and counseling he underwent during and afterward. This writer attempted to focus on four years ago rather than who Adrian is now as a father.\u201d\n\nAs of this writing, neither Tesfatsion nor the NFL could be reached by The Post for comment.

(Mason Trinca for The Washington Post)\n\nMoita Lindgren, a nurse and mother of three, had the recipe picked out long in advance of Thanksgiving.\n\nHer father-in-law, Papa Forrest, had died this summer at age 76. Someone would have to make the vegetarian stuffing he prepared every year, a favorite of her children. Luckily, Lindgren had taken the recipe down by hand five years ago, aware that she would need it someday.\n\nThis was the year.\n\nBut then the family\u2019s home in Paradise, Calif., was incinerated in the wildfire that has choked wide swaths of this state with flames and smoke \u2014 one of the more than 13,000 homes to be destroyed in the catastrophic Butte County blaze. And up went the recipe, too.\n\nStill, Lindgren, 46, said she and her husband felt a profound sense of gratitude, having escaped with their pets, despite the fact that they had lost just about every possession they owned.\n\n\u201cYou really see the true kindness and beauty of people that you don\u2019t typically see on a day-to-day basis,\u201d she said, after leaving the main post office in this college town of 90,000 to pick up her mail. \u201cAnd it just highlights what\u2019s truly important. So I feel tremendously blessed.\u201d\n\nLindgren\u2019s optimism is shared by many of the tens of thousands of evacuees who have spilled out into shelters, tents, hastily arranged rental units, and the homes of friends, family and even strangers. Despite the devastation the fire wrought in this area, dozens of evacuees said it has brought the true meaning of the holiday into stark relief, though it has removed some of its more celebratory trappings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the best Thanksgiving of my life,\u201d said Liza Johnson, a Paradise evacuee who is staying with her husband and son in a trailer on loan from a friend. \u201cBeing alive \u2014 and my family being alive \u2014 it makes you realize.\u201d\n\nThanksgiving marks two weeks since the fire swept through this part of northern California \u2014 the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state\u2019s history.\n\nAnd many evacuees admitted that their holiday plans were a sign of just how off-kilter their lives have become. For some, the holiday typically spent with family in a warm home will be spent with strangers at a shelter or in a tent in the rain.\n\nFor others, like Johnny Morgan, 55, it required navigating delicate family dynamics that in a less fraught time, would perhaps have been easier to avoid.\n\n\n\nVolunteers wait to load ham and turkey into a refrigerated truck in preparation for the Thanksgiving event at Cal State. Organizers said they\u2019re preparing to feed 15,000 people. (Mason Trinca for The Washington Post)\n\nMorgan, who lost his home, said he was staying at the shelter in Chico because of friction between his girlfriend and his family that had invited him to stay with them.\n\n\u201cI am stressed out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just nuts.\u201d\n\nKevin Alcott and his wife, whose home was destroyed when the fire flattened Paradise, are more lucky than many; they quickly found a long-term shelter in the form of two rooms that they are renting in a local woman\u2019s house. They\u2019ll be spending Thanksgiving with her, cooking a turkey donated by their church.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really feel like a holiday that much,\u201d he said.\n\nThe day before Thanksgiving, Alcott sat with his wife, Arin, at a Starbucks in the city\u2019s downtown, listing the worries that are piling up: When will they be able to get back to work? Will they be able to pay the bills? How will they restart their lives? Where will they find a new home?\n\nBut he too said he felt a profound sense of gratitude that things did not turn out worse.\n\nIt was a sentiment shared by Paradise resident Deborah Laughlin, 63.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful because I now have a place I can go to, someplace where I can rest my head,\u201d Laughlin said, as she stood outside one of the several shelters set up to help evacuees here.\n\nThough her trailer home was destroyed in the fire, Laughlin said she was filled with hope. Two volunteers helped her get set up with a new place to live, in a mobile home on another volunteer\u2019s property.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s already offered for me to get a small dog,\u201d Laughlin said.\n\nThe Camp Fire has burned more than 150,000 acres, destroying more than 14,000 buildings \u2014 13,500 homes \u2014 in hillside towns like Paradise and Magalia. And it continues to burn, with at least 80 percent containment, the thick smell of smoke in the air in Chico persisting even through a heavy rain. At least 83 people were killed by the fire, though hundreds more remain missing.\n\nCynthia Johnson, 54, sitting outside the shelter at the Neighborhood Church of Chico, said she doesn\u2019t know the fate of her mobile home in Paradise. Still, she listed off her blessings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful for everything,\u201d she said, beaming. \u201cMost of all, I\u2019m thankful that the one thing I love the most, my service dog, is safe and she\u2019s with me. \u201d\n\nA woman drove up in a truck and handed her a new blanket.\n\nLast year, Johnson cooked a big Thanksgiving meal for nine people in her trailer park; this year, she\u2019ll go to her daughter-in-law\u2019s aunt\u2019s house outside the fire zone.\n\nAnd across Chico, people were coming together to help others.\n\nIn two bustling buildings at California State University at Chico, dozens of volunteers helped workers from chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s\u2019s nonprofit World Central Kitchen plan for a massive Thanksgiving meal for evacuees and emergency workers on Thursday. They unfurled long white table clothes in the Bell Memorial Union auditorium, as workers outside wheeled in carts with hundreds of turkeys waiting to be cooked. Whispers about visits by chefs like Andr\u00e9s, Guy Fieri and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger filled the auditorium.\n\nRepresentatives for World Central Kitchen said they were preparing to feed some 15,000 people.\n\nVolunteer Cindy Rogers, 59, said she is spending her Thanksgiving helping serve evacuees after her plans changed: Her brother was going to host Thanksgiving this year, but he ended up leaving his house so a fire evacuee could temporarily move in.\n\nJackie Legg, a volunteer and Chico resident who was registering others at the hall\u2019s entrance, said her 25-year-old son, his girlfriend and the girlfriend\u2019s mother were staying with her after they lost their homes in Paradise.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re more thankful,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies are more connected right now.\u201d\n\nLindgren, the mother of three, said the fire had clarified the family\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose everything, you realize that you really don\u2019t need a lot,\u201d she said, \u201cand that the things that are truly important are the things you took with you when you left the fire.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/nmiroff, https://www.facebook.com/josh.partlow1", "title": "Trump plan would force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as cases are processed, a major break with current policy", "description": "A Mexican official said that current Mexican immigration law does not allow those seeking asylum in another country to stay in Mexico.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-plan-would-force-asylum-seekers-to-wait-in-mexico-as-cases-are-processed-a-major-break-with-current-policy/2018/11/21/5ad47e82-ede8-11e8-9236-bb94154151d2_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qidRZZGgfQfyEKXi_zeZVJUC-Vs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TDTBHJHN74I6RBTZSNFCWM56KI.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T03:18:01Z", "content": "Central Americans who arrive at U.S. border crossings seeking asylum in the United States will have to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed under sweeping new measures the Trump administration is preparing to implement, according to internal planni\u2026 [+6247 chars]", "fulltext": "Migrants line up to cross into the United States from Tijuana, Mexico, at the San Ysidro port of entry Monday. (Gregory Bull/AP)\n\nCentral Americans who arrive at U.S. border crossings seeking asylum in the United States will have to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed under sweeping new measures the Trump administration is preparing to implement, according to internal planning documents and three Department of Homeland Security officials familiar with the initiative.\n\nAccording to DHS memos obtained by The Washington Post on Wednesday, Central American asylum seekers who cannot establish a \u201creasonable fear\u201d of persecution in Mexico will not be allowed to enter the United States and would be turned around at the border.\n\nThe plan, called \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d amounts to a major break with current screening procedures, which generally allow those who establish a fear of return to their home countries to avoid immediate deportation and remain in the United States until they can get a hearing with an immigration judge. Trump despises this system, which he calls \u201ccatch and release,\u201d and has vowed to end it.\n\nAmong the thousands of Central American migrants traveling by caravan across Mexico, many hope to apply for asylum due to threats of gang violence or other persecution in their home countries. They had expected to be able to stay in the United States while their claims move through immigration court. The new rules would disrupt those plans, and the hopes of other Central Americans who seek asylum in the United States each year.\n\n[Trump lashes out at judge after order to allow illegal border crossers to seek asylum]\n\nTrump remains furious about the caravan and the legal setbacks his administration has suffered in federal court, demanding hard-line policy ideas from aides. Senior adviser Stephen Miller has pushed to implement the Remain in Mexico plan immediately, though other senior officials have expressed concern about implementing it amid sensitive negotiations with the Mexican government, according to two DHS officials and a White House adviser with knowledge of the plan, which was discussed at the White House on Tuesday, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the administration\u2019s new plan, if a migrant does not specifically fear persecution in Mexico, that is where they will stay. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is sending teams of asylum officers from field offices in San Francisco, Washington, and Los Angeles to the ports of entry in the San Diego area to implement the new screening procedures, according to a USCIS official.\n\nTo cross into the United States, asylum seekers would have to meet a relatively higher bar in the screening procedure to establish that their fears of being in Mexico are enough to require immediate admission, the documents say.\n\n\u201cIf you are determined to have a reasonable fear of remaining in Mexico, you will be permitted to remain in the United States while you await your hearing before an immigration judge,\u201d the asylum officers will now tell those who arrive seeking humanitarian refuge, according to the DHS memos. \u201cIf you are not determined to have a reasonable fear of remaining in Mexico, you will remain in Mexico.\u201d\n\nMexican border cities are among the most violent in the country, as drug cartels battle over access to smuggling routes into the United States. In the state of Baja California, which includes Tijuana, the State Department warns that \u201ccriminal activity and violence, including homicide, remain a primary concern throughout the state.\u201d\n\nThe new rules will take effect as soon as Friday, according to two DHS officials familiar with the plans.\n\nKatie Waldman, a spokeswoman for DHS, issued a statement late Wednesday saying there are no immediate plans to implement these new measures.\n\n\u201cThe President has made clear \u2014 every single legal option is on the table to secure our nation and to deal with the flood of illegal immigrants at our borders,\u201d the statement says. \u201cDHS is not implementing such a new enforcement program this week. Reporting on policies that do not exist creates uncertainty and confusion along our borders and has a negative real world impact. We will ensure \u2014 as always \u2014 that any new program or policy will comply with humanitarian obligations, uphold our national security and sovereignty, and is implemented with notice to the public and well coordinated with partners.\u201d\n\nA Mexican official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that current Mexican immigration law does not allow those seeking asylum in another country to stay in Mexico.\n\nOn Dec. 1, a new Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, will be sworn in, and it\u2019s also unclear whether his transition team was consulted on the new asylum screening procedures.\n\nThe possibility that thousands of U.S.-bound asylum seekers would have to wait in Mexico for months, even years, could produce a significant financial burden for the government there, especially if the migrants remain in camps and shelters on a long-term basis.\n\n[At the U.S. border, migrant caravan will slow to a crawl]\n\nThere are currently 6,000 migrants in the Tijuana area, many of them camped at a baseball field along the border, seeking to enter the United States. Several thousand more are en route to the city as part of caravan groups, according to Homeland Security estimates.\n\nU.S. border officials have allowed about 60 to 100 asylum seekers to approach the San Ysidro port of entry each day for processing.\n\nLast week, BuzzFeed News reported that U.S. and Mexican officials were discussing such a plan.\n\nMexico also appears to be taking a less-permissive attitude toward the new migrant caravans now entering the country.\n\nAuthorities detained more than 200 people, or nearly all of the latest caravan, who recently crossed Mexico\u2019s southern border on their way to the United States. This is at least the fourth large group of migrants to cross into Mexico and attempt to walk to the U.S. border. They were picked up not long after crossing. The vast majority of the migrants were from El Salvador, according to Mexico\u2019s National Immigration Institute.\n\nAfter the first caravan this fall entered Mexico, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s administration offered migrants the chance to live and work in Mexico as long as they stayed in the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca.

It is condemned by the United Nations and considered a human rights violation, but the practice is common for girls in parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The World Health Organization says more than 200 million women and girls living in 30 countries have experienced FGM, the common acronym for female genital mutilation.\n\nLawyers for Nagarwala asked the judge to dismiss the charges on the basis that Congress did not have the authority to prohibit female genital mutilation. The judge agreed, ruling that the law could not be permitted under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing commercial or economic about FGM,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nFriedman said the government failed to show that the procedure is a commercial activity or interstate market that would be subject to federal law, such as the markets for illegal drugs and pornography.\n\n\u201cThis is not a market, but a small number of alleged victims,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cIf there is an interstate market for FGM, why is this the first time the government has ever brought charges under this 1996 statute?\u201d\n\n[Detroit-area doctors indicted in \u2018brutal\u2019 genital mutilation case]\n\nThe government had also argued that female genital mutilation is an \u201cillegal form of healthcare\u201d and could therefore be regulated by Congress. But the judge pushed back against that argument, saying the procedure is \u201ca form of physical assault, not anything approaching a healthcare service.\u201d\n\nFriedman also rebutted the government\u2019s suggestion that variances in state laws mean that those seeking female genital mutilation can \u201ctravel to refuge states where the practice is not prohibited.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo state offers refuge to those who harm children,\u201d Friedman responded. He also noted that 27 states have passed laws that criminalize female genital mutilation. Moreover, since the procedure involves unlawful touching and penetration, it could also be prosecuted as criminal sexual conduct, the judge wrote.\n\nMichigan was one of several states that rushed to pass bans against female genital mutilation amid the high-profile case last year. The law applies to doctors who perform the surgery and parents who transport a child to it.\n\nThe Department of Justice could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but a spokeswoman told the Associated Press that the U.S. attorney\u2019s office is reviewing Friedman\u2019s ruling.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, lawyers on behalf of Nagarwala celebrated the judge\u2019s opinion.\n\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s decision by the Court is exactly what our justice system is designed to do,\u201d read the statement from Shannon Smith and Molly Blythe. \u201cThe judge found Congress, through the United States Constitution, lacked authority to enact the FGM statute. The law warranted this decision and we are happy with it.\u201d\n\nNagarwala and other defendants still face obstruction charges; they are accused of telling members of their community not to cooperate with investigators. Nagarwala also remains charged with conspiracy to travel with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, and she is expected to face trial in April, according to the Detroit Free Press."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "http://www.facebook.com/des.bieler", "title": "Sixers' Markelle Fultz reportedly wants to be traded amid injury issues - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Sixers' Markelle Fultz reportedly wants to be traded amid injury issues Washington Post On Tuesday, it was revealed that Markelle Fultz's agent told the Philadelphia 76ers that the former No. 1 overall pick would not play or practice with the \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/22/sixers-markelle-fultz-reportedly-wants-be-traded-amid-injury-issues/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NEaFOr7Ak4nsfjLRNfgo1Ln_ybk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DGR2AQGYEII6RA4EXTCUSL7PJE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T02:44:37Z", "content": "On Tuesday, it was revealed that Markelle Fultzs agent told the Philadelphia 76ers that the former No. 1 overall pick would not play or practice with the team until his shoulder was examined by a specialist early next week.

To judge from a report published Wednesday, someone in Fultz\u2019s camp is now letting it be known that he\u2019d rather not return to Philadelphia at all.\n\nThat\u2019s according to The Athletic, which cited sources with knowledge of Fultz\u2019s thinking in reporting that he \u201cwould prefer a fresh start with a new team.\u201d Apparently those sources didn\u2019t include the agent, Raymond Brothers, who told ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski on Wednesday that he has \u201cgiven no indication to [76ers General Manager] Elton Brand or anyone else that Markelle would prefer to be traded,\u201d adding, \u201cMy focus is to get Markelle healthy. End of story.\u201d\n\nThe Athletic also reported, per league sources, that in addition to Fultz\u2019s well-chronicled issues with his right shoulder, he is dealing with an injury to his right wrist that is contributing to his problems shooting the ball. The 20-year-old guard has gained notice recently for some unorthodox free throw motions, including a double-pump and a pre-shot routine in which he moved the basketball back and forth between his hands before quickly tossing it toward the hoop.\n\nThis is worse than we have ever seen Fultz's free throw form look. pic.twitter.com/FhCYpNpd5b \u2014 Kyle Neubeck (@KyleNeubeck) November 13, 2018\n\nSurely Markelle Fultz is just messing with us now....

Just trial and error,\u201d Fultz said Saturday of the pre-shot routine. \u201cIt\u2019s been working nice for me so I\u2019m going to stick with it for now.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Athletic, citing a source familiar with the matter, the routine is meant to help Fultz \u201cblock out the yips,\u201d from which he has been suffering as a result of his injuries. The website reported that its source said concerns about his physical condition have caused Fultz to \u201cdouble clutch, or hesitate, fearful the ball may slip,\u201d and that \u201cit is as much a mental hurdle as it is a physical one.\u201d\n\nFultz reportedly experiences occasional discomfort when he brings the ball from chest level to its set point before release, and The Athletic claimed that, at least in the recent past, he was \u201cexperiencing sensation issues in his right thumb\u201d which made it difficult to grip the ball. A shooting coach with whom Fultz worked earlier this year said recently on Twitter that the player is \u201cstill not healthy,\u201d but he subsequently deleted the tweet and 76ers officials have not been publicly of the same opinion.\n\n\u201cThis news about his shoulder, it did catch me off guard,\u201d Philadelphia Coach Brett Brown said Tuesday (via the AP). \u201cIf it\u2019s that real, and he needs to go see a further sort of consultation, then we support him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that we saw medically that didn\u2019t allow him to play,\u201d said Brand. \u201c[Fultz] played last night. He played two nights ago. Ever since Jimmy Butler came and he wasn\u2019t starting, I felt he played pretty well. I was proud of the way he bounced back from a lot of things.\u201d\n\nJoel Embiid's full quote when he was asked about Markelle Fultz pic.twitter.com/E9cAE9Ayhh \u2014 Rich Hofmann (@rich_hofmann) November 22, 2018\n\nAfter injuries \u2014 and possibly, as was widely speculated, confidence issues related to his injury and shooting problems \u2014 limited Fultz to just 14 games in his rookie season, he had appeared in all 19 of the 76ers\u2019 contests this season before missing Wednesday\u2019s home matchup with the Pelicans. He had started the first 15 games before being moved to the bench after the team traded for Butler.\n\nIn Fultz\u2019s most recent game, a home win over the Suns, he played barely more than seven minutes, with Brown giving T.J. McConnell more time in the backup point guard role. For the season, Fultz is averaging 8.2 points in 22.5 minutes, with 3.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds, and he has been notably shy about shooting from the outside, attempting just 14 three-point shots total and making four.\n\nThe disappointing play, in concert with the ongoing and decidedly mysterious injury problems, could make it difficult for Philadelphia to get back much value if they decide to trade away Fultz. However, particularly after the acquisition of Butler, giving the team a third star to complement Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, the 76ers may well have reached a point of agreement that the best thing for all parties would be to find Fultz a change of scenery.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nNBA roundtable: Venting about these dang Wizards edition\n\nKevin Durant says Draymond Green comments won\u2019t affect free agency decision\n\nThe nation\u2019s top running back recruit is changing positions. \u2018Smart guy,\u2019 says Adrian Peterson.\n\nSometimes backup quarterbacks are backups for a reason.

(Andy Wong/Associated Press)\n\nHOTAN UNITY NEW VILLAGE, China \u2014 In this corner of China\u2019s far west, rows of identical white concrete houses with red metal roofs rise abruptly above the sand dunes of the harsh Taklamakan Desert. A Chinese flag flutters above the settlement, and a billboard at the entrance says, \u201cWelcome to the Hotan Unity New Village.\u201d\n\nThis is a Communist Party showcase for its efforts to tame the Xinjiang region, the heartland of China\u2019s often restive Uighur Muslim minority and an unforgiving terrain. The free or low-cost houses are assigned alternately to Uighurs and Han Chinese, who work side-by-side in greenhouses and send their children to school together. It is the future the party envisions for Xinjiang after a massive security crackdown that has sent by some estimates more than a million Muslims to internment camps, and many of their children to orphanages.\n\nBut a closer look at what the party calls \u201cethnic unity\u201d reveals what isn\u2019t there: mosques for Muslim worshippers, or traditional Uighur brick homes, often adorned with pointed arches and carved decorations. In their place are colorful murals of what authorities consider to be scenes of unity, such as a Uighur man and his family holding a Chinese flag.\n\nIn the village\u2019s new public square, Uighur children banter with Han Chinese children in fluent Mandarin, the language of the Han majority, rather than in their native tongue. Young Uighur women wear Western clothing without the headscarves that are part of traditional Muslim dress.\n\nWhile these are voluntary settlements with economic benefits, experts and Uighur activists believe they are part of an aggressive government campaign to erode the identities of the Central Asian groups who called the region home long before waves of Han migrants arrived in recent decades.\n\n\u201c\u2019Ethnic unity\u2019 is a euphemism for taming, breaking the Uighur people,\u201d says Joanne Smith Finley, an expert in Uighur identity at Newcastle University in the U.K. \u201cThis is putting flowery bright wallpaper over a damp wall, a rotting wall.\u201d\n\nConstruction of the village began in 2014 with a planned investment of 1.7 billion yuan ($247 million). The goal was to build 5,000 homes and 10,000 greenhouses, according to local reports, to turn a large swath of desert into farmland and create a shared prosperity among Uighurs and Han Chinese.\n\nAround the same time, the Communist Party came forth with a new strategy focused on ethnic mingling. Subsequently, at least one county offered financial incentives for Uighur-Han intermarriages, while others have launched programs encouraging Uighur families to move into Han Chinese residential areas.\n\nChina is building several such mixed settlements in Xinjiang. A similar village is under construction as a tourist attraction near Kuqa, around 600 kilometers (372 miles) from Hotan. A concrete yurt known as the \u201csolidarity farmhouse\u201d already has been completed, and a giant sculpture of a pomegranate is prominently placed at the center of the village to symbolize unity.\n\nIn Hotan, there are signs that the government\u2019s experiment is making inroads. Uighur farmers toil alongside Han Chinese to farm crops in what was once barren desert land, and both groups live in modern houses equipped with gas, electricity and water. A billboard displays a picture of President Xi Jinping and a group of Uighur elders joining hands and, according to the caption, \u201clinking hearts.\u201d\n\nYet there are also signs of enduring mistrust. As elsewhere in Xinjiang, high walls around homes are topped with barbed wire, and police officers stand guard from behind fences at the entrance of the village. Adults don\u2019t mix socially \u2014 at night, a group of Han Chinese dance in the square while the Uighur residents chat among themselves on the sidelines.\n\nA Uighur farmer who moved to the village last September says authorities provided him with free housing and utilities, two greenhouses, a small orchard with grapevines and a barn with sheep, chickens, and pigeons. But the crackdown on Muslims in Xinjiang has made it risky for ordinary Muslims to discuss their religious practices, and when speaking to reporters in front of government observers, he insists he was never a Muslim. Another Uighur farmer in his early seventies, Muzitohtahon, says he is no longer a Muslim.\n\nUighur and Han villagers do seem united by at least one factor \u2014 their desire to escape poverty. Rural areas in Xinjiang, including Hotan, rank among the poorest in China, with many families lacking even the most basic utilities and food. The financial incentives are also a key draw for Han Chinese from other impoverished regions of China.\n\nLast May, 58-year-old Xiao Erying, who is Han Chinese, moved to this village from her hometown in the southern province of Hunan, over 4,000 kilometers away. \u201cIt is better than our hometown,\u201d she says, as she rakes sheep, chicken and cow manure inside her greenhouse.\n\nFor 60,000 yuan ($8,700), her family bought a two-bedroom home with a small orchard and two greenhouses. The two grandchildren she lives with are given free tuition, school lunches, and even a free set of clothes. Xiao admits she doesn\u2019t speak Uighur and cannot communicate with her Uighur neighbors, but she says the layout encourages interaction.\n\nIn a greenhouse a few dozen meters away, Uighur Abudu Mijiti has just begun planting chili with his wife. He moved to the village three years ago to make a more stable living. Two of his three children go to the local school and are fluent in Chinese, he says, as a government minder looks on.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s good, it helps learning our national language,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because our next-door neighbor is Chinese, as we go in and out, it helps improve ethnic unity.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, the picture presented at the Hotan Unity New Village reflects the government\u2019s vision of an \u201cidealized place,\u201d says David O\u2019Brien, an expert at the University of Nottingham.\n\n\u201cEvery single part of it is the official narrative,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cThe narrative is, water will flow to the desert. The narrative is, if you come here great opportunity awaits you. The narrative that people will be secular, they will learn Mandarin.\u201d\n\nYet the settlement remains only partly inhabited. The city says there are 534 households in the compound, but most of the houses are empty. A drive through reveals rows of empty greenhouses and house after house with a sign that says \u201csealed off\u201d patched onto padlocked or chained gates.\n\nUnder the sweltering desert sun, one Han Chinese farmer tending to her plot of Chinese chives complains that water is scarce and her previous batch of chives had to be thrown out. Even when the crops work out, the chives sell for less than one yuan (14 cents) per kilogram.\n\n\u201cNot even enough for food,\u201d she grumbles. \u201cYou cannot feed yourself just working on greenhouses.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of government minders, the woman goes on.\n\n\u201cOrdinary people are not able to eat meat. The officials can, but not the ordinary people,\u201d says the woman, who declines to give her name out of fear of retaliation.\n\nAs dusk approaches and temperatures fall, residents slowly make their way out onto the streets to enjoy the evening breeze. On the Uighur side of the street, a young Uighur woman rests on an electric bike after a day\u2019s work, looking at her cell phone.\n\nAsked what she thinks of unity, she looks up.\n\n\u201cUnity?\u201d she asks. Silently and slowly, she shakes her head, and returns to her phone.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Xinjiang is a region not a province.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A former finance minister says the country is on the brink of an \u201ceconomic anarchy.\u201d\n\nWelcome to Sri Lanka, where the political crisis is getting worse by the week.\n\nThe trouble started when President Maithripala Sirisena, fed up with disagreements with his prime minister over money, an alleged conspiracy plot and unresolved issues of wartime crimes against civilians, fired Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Cabinet and replaced them with a government headed by a popular former strongman, Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nBut lawmakers balked and twice passed a no-confidence motion. Sirisena, however, refuses to accept that his choice of prime minister has been defeated.\n\nJehan Perera, head of the local analyst group National Peace Council, said that the government appointed by the president can\u2019t be called legal because Sirisena had not sought a parliamentary vote when he dismissed Wickremesinghe.\n\n\u201cIt can be called illegitimate because provisions for a confidence vote in Parliament are being blocked by the president\u2019s own party through their riotous behavior,\u201d Perera said, referring to a brawl last week that was followed by another pandemonium in the chamber when Rajapaksa loyalists refused to let the speaker conduct proceedings.\n\nWickremesinghe says his dismissal is invalid because he still holds a majority in the 225-member Parliament. The dismissal is also disputed because of a latest constitutional change, which lawyers say has taken away presidential powers to dismiss the prime minister.\n\nDespite all the drama and two rival prime ministers, life hasn\u2019t collapsed \u2014 thanks to the efficient bureaucracy that keeps the wheels of administration turning.\n\nEven though there is no Cabinet recognized by Parliament, and despite warnings by Wickremesinghe supporters that state officials should not take orders from an \u201cillegal government\u201d of Rajapaksa, bureaucrats continue to work with the president who is the chief executive and the ministers appointed by him, officials said on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nHowever, decisions regarding new projects or purchases involving large sums of money are on hold.\n\nThe absence of a recognized government has delayed the budget for 2019. Mangala Samaraweera, who was finance minister in Wickremesinghe\u2019s Cabinet, said that there will be no legal way of spending money in the coming year without a parliament-approved budget.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Constitution says that control over public finances lies with Parliament and no funds can be released without a warrant signed by the finance minister and approved by the legislature. That means all government payments starting from January can be deemed illegal, Samaraweera says.\n\nSri Lanka is on the brink of an \u201ceconomic anarchy and chaos as never experienced before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cavalier and irresponsible actions of the president ... based on personal animosities and precipitating a series of illegal acts, places at risk Sri Lanka\u2019s ability to meet its immediate debt obligations,\u201d he said.\n\nSri Lanka has to repay $1 billion of its foreign loans in early January, which is also in the prerogative of Parliament to approve.\n\nWickremesinghe\u2019s lawmakers have presented a motion to the speaker seeking to block funding to the prime minister\u2019s office, which if passed, would curtail Rajapaksa\u2019s functions.\n\n\u201cAs far as the people are concerned, they are witnessing the normal functioning of the country,\u201d insisted government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella.\n\nHowever, he conceded that Sri Lanka will have issues on accessing government money if the stalemate is not resolved by the end of the year. Sirisena called snap elections for Jan. 5, but the opposition challenged the decision, and the dispute is in court.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Her mother explained: \u201cIt\u2019s very overwhelming.\u201d\n\nAsked later if she had anything to say, Lawrence told reporters in the Bahasa Indonesia language: \u201cThanks to the government of Indonesia. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nLawrence faces potential arrest in Newcastle on warrants including one that alleges the former panel beater was involved in a high-speed police chase in a stolen car a month before her arrest in Bali in April 2005.\n\nNew South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller had indicated a deal with Lawrence\u2019s lawyers to hand herself in to police was more likely than her being arrested at Newcastle Airport.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, we will make a time reasonable with her legal team to bring her in to have those warrants satisfied,\u201d Fuller told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nLawrence was again surrounded by journalists and cameras on arrival in Newcastle but said nothing as she walked from the airport to a waiting car.\n\nMaryoto Sumadi, head of Bali\u2019s justice and human rights office, said Lawrence is banned from ever re-entering Indonesia.\n\nShe may be the only member of the group dubbed the \u201cBali Nine\u201d by Australian media to walk free from prison.\n\nAndrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the ringleaders, were executed by a firing squad in 2015, causing a diplomatic furor between often testy neighbors Indonesia and Australia.\n\nFive others had their sentences increased to life on appeal, and another member, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, died from cancer in May.\n\nLawrence, whom Customs caught with 2.2 kilograms (4.8 pounds) of heroin strapped to her body, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined 1 billion rupiah ($68,000). She didn\u2019t appeal and almost every year her sentence was reduced during holiday remissions that are customary in Indonesia for inmates with good behavior, except those on death row or sentenced to life.\n\nLawrence\u2019s sentence was completed in May but was extended by six months because she couldn\u2019t afford to pay the fine, Bangli prison chief Made Suwendra said.\n\nAnother convicted Australian drug smuggler, Schapelle Corby, whose trial and imprisonment on Bali mesmerized her country for more than a decade, returned home last year.\n\nCorby was arrested in 2004 at the age of 27 with more than 4 kilograms (9 pounds) of marijuana inside her boogie board bag, sparking a media frenzy in Australia on par with America\u2019s O.J. Simpson trial.\n\nCorby\u2019s insistence that the drugs were planted by baggage handlers was dismissed as a lie by Balinese prosecutors. A court sentenced her to 20 years in prison, though that was later reduced.\n\n______\n\nAssociated Press writer Rod McGuirk, in Canberra, Australia, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Mason Trinca for The Washington Post)\n\nMoita Lindgren, a nurse and mother of three, had the recipe picked out long in advance of Thanksgiving.\n\nHer father-in-law, Papa Forrest, had died this summer at age 76. Someone would have to make the vegetarian stuffing he prepared every year, a favorite of her children. Luckily, Lindgren had taken the recipe down by hand five years ago, aware that she would need it someday.\n\nThis was the year.\n\nBut then the family\u2019s home in Paradise, Calif., was incinerated in the wildfire that has choked wide swaths of this state with flames and smoke \u2014 one of the more than 13,000 homes to be destroyed in the catastrophic Butte County blaze. And up went the recipe, too.\n\nStill, Lindgren, 46, said she and her husband felt a profound sense of gratitude, having escaped with their pets, despite the fact that they had lost just about every possession they owned.\n\n\u201cYou really see the true kindness and beauty of people that you don\u2019t typically see on a day-to-day basis,\u201d she said, after leaving the main post office in this college town of 90,000 to pick up her mail. \u201cAnd it just highlights what\u2019s truly important. So I feel tremendously blessed.\u201d\n\nLindgren\u2019s optimism is shared by many of the tens of thousands of evacuees who have spilled out into shelters, tents, hastily arranged rental units, and the homes of friends, family and even strangers. Despite the devastation the fire wrought in this area, dozens of evacuees said it has brought the true meaning of the holiday into stark relief, though it has removed some of its more celebratory trappings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the best Thanksgiving of my life,\u201d said Liza Johnson, a Paradise evacuee who is staying with her husband and son in a trailer on loan from a friend. \u201cBeing alive \u2014 and my family being alive \u2014 it makes you realize.\u201d\n\nThanksgiving marks two weeks since the fire swept through this part of northern California \u2014 the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state\u2019s history.\n\nAnd many evacuees admitted that their holiday plans were a sign of just how off-kilter their lives have become. For some, the holiday typically spent with family in a warm home will be spent with strangers at a shelter or in a tent in the rain.\n\nFor others, like Johnny Morgan, 55, it required navigating delicate family dynamics that in a less fraught time, would perhaps have been easier to avoid.\n\n\n\nVolunteers wait to load ham and turkey into a refrigerated truck in preparation for the Thanksgiving event at Cal State.

They\u2019ll be spending Thanksgiving with her, cooking a turkey donated by their church.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really feel like a holiday that much,\u201d he said.\n\nThe day before Thanksgiving, Alcott sat with his wife, Arin, at a Starbucks in the city\u2019s downtown, listing the worries that are piling up: When will they be able to get back to work? Will they be able to pay the bills? How will they restart their lives? Where will they find a new home?\n\nBut he too said he felt a profound sense of gratitude that things did not turn out worse.\n\nIt was a sentiment shared by Paradise resident Deborah Laughlin, 63.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful because I now have a place I can go to, someplace where I can rest my head,\u201d Laughlin said, as she stood outside one of the several shelters set up to help evacuees here.\n\nThough her trailer home was destroyed in the fire, Laughlin said she was filled with hope. Two volunteers helped her get set up with a new place to live, in a mobile home on another volunteer\u2019s property.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s already offered for me to get a small dog,\u201d Laughlin said.\n\nThe Camp Fire has burned more than 150,000 acres, destroying more than 14,000 buildings \u2014 13,500 homes \u2014 in hillside towns like Paradise and Magalia. And it continues to burn, with at least 80 percent containment, the thick smell of smoke in the air in Chico persisting even through a heavy rain. At least 83 people were killed by the fire, though hundreds more remain missing.\n\nCynthia Johnson, 54, sitting outside the shelter at the Neighborhood Church of Chico, said she doesn\u2019t know the fate of her mobile home in Paradise. Still, she listed off her blessings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful for everything,\u201d she said, beaming. \u201cMost of all, I\u2019m thankful that the one thing I love the most, my service dog, is safe and she\u2019s with me. \u201d\n\nA woman drove up in a truck and handed her a new blanket.\n\nLast year, Johnson cooked a big Thanksgiving meal for nine people in her trailer park; this year, she\u2019ll go to her daughter-in-law\u2019s aunt\u2019s house outside the fire zone.\n\nAnd across Chico, people were coming together to help others.\n\nIn two bustling buildings at California State University at Chico, dozens of volunteers helped workers from chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s\u2019s nonprofit World Central Kitchen plan for a massive Thanksgiving meal for evacuees and emergency workers on Thursday.

South Korea said Wednesday it will dissolve a foundation funded by Japan to compensate South Korean women who were forced to work in Japan\u2019s World War II military brothels. (Lee Jin-man/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s decision to dissolve a foundation funded by Japan to compensate South Korean women who were forced to work in Japan\u2019s World War II military brothels has thrown fuel on the diplomatic fire between the countries, who have a bitter wartime history.\n\nThe announcement Wednesday was expected as many South Koreans believe that Seoul\u2019s previous conservative government settled for far too less in the 2015 deal, and that Japan still hasn\u2019t acknowledged legal responsibility for atrocities during its colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.\n\nJapan, meanwhile, is angry that South Korea is effectively walking back on an internationally recognized agreement.\n\nA look at the intensifying dispute between South Korea and Japan:\n\n___\n\nTHE WOMEN\n\nThe women forced to work in the brothels were mainly from Japan and Korea, but also from the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia. They were sent to hundreds of front-line brothels called \u201ccomfort stations\u201d to provide sex for the Japanese army that invaded and occupied Asian countries from the early 1930s through the end of World War II.\n\nWartime documents show that Japan\u2019s military supervised the brothels, and set the tariffs, service hours and hygiene standards. Government documents say the purpose was to keep soldiers from raping women and triggering anti-Japan sentiment, as well as preventing venereal disease and Chinese espionage.\n\nInitially, some were professionals or from poor Japanese families, historians say. In South Korea, they were often deceived by local agents who recruited them promising factory work. Later in the war, many minors in the Philippines were kidnapped, raped or tricked into working in the brothels, some victims said.\n\n___\n\nJAPAN\u2019S STANCE\n\nJapan\u2019s government has repeatedly denied there was any coercion, and more recently has refused to use the term \u201csex slave\u201d for the women in English media and U.N. documents.\n\nJapan has intensified its stance in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s nationalist government, which says there is no official record showing the wartime government\u2019s systematic use of coercion. Some ultra-right-wing lawmakers say the South Korean women forced to work in the brothels were all prostitutes, and there is increasing bashing of supporters of the survivors, as well as journalists for writing stories about them.\n\nThe issue flared in 2014 after a former reporter from Japan\u2019s left-leaning Asahi newspaper was accused of fabricating his report on the first South Korean survivor who came forward, leading to defamation lawsuits still pending in Japan.\n\nStatues honoring the victims erected in the U.S. and elsewhere by South Korean groups have also upset the Japanese government.\n\n___\n\nTHE WOMEN\u2019S DEMANDS\n\nThe former victims have demanded compensation and an apology from Japan\u2019s government. Japan in 1995 set up the semi-government Asian Women\u2019s Fund, a scheme to finance compensatory projects for victims from across Asia, including South Koreans.\n\nIn all, the fund paid nearly 5 billion yen ($44.2 million) for medical and welfare projects for all the recognized women from across Asia, including 61 South Koreans. But many others in South Korea rejected the fund because of pressure from their support group\u2019s policy to keep demanding official compensation.\n\nEstimates by historians for the total number of victims range from 20,000 to 200,000. In South Korea, about 240 women came forward and registered with the government as victims, and only 27 of them are still alive.\n\n___\n\nTHE 2015 DEAL\n\nUnder the agreement reached in December 2015, Japan pledged to fund a Seoul-based foundation to help support the victims. However, Japan said it didn\u2019t consider the 1 billion yen it provided to the fund as compensation, insisting that all wartime compensation issues were settled in a 1965 treaty that restored diplomatic ties between the countries and was accompanied by more than $800 million in economic aid and loans from Tokyo to Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea, in exchange, vowed to refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue and will try to resolve a Japanese grievance over a statue of a girl representing victims of sexual slavery that sits in front of the Japanese Embassy in downtown Seoul.\n\nThe deal initially described by Seoul and Tokyo as \u201cfinal and irreversible\u201d turned out to be anything but. Many victims refused payment. Anti-Japan activists rallied furiously, accusing the government of former conservative President Park Geun-hye of \u201cselling away\u201d the honor and dignity of the aging victims. College students began camping out in the street across the embassy to protect the statue from potential attempts to remove it. A 64-year-old Buddhist monk died after setting himself on fire to protest the deal in January 2017.\n\nJapan expressed anger that South Korea didn\u2019t taken specific steps to remove the statue and similar monuments in other places in the country, insisting there has been a clear understanding to do so.\n\nLiberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who won office in May last year following Park\u2019s removal from office over a corruption scandal, said in December 2017 that the 2015 agreement was seriously flawed because Park\u2019s government failed to properly communicate with the victims before reaching the deal.\n\n___\n\nHISTORICAL ISSUES\n\nThe legacy of sexual slavery is hardly the only issue of contention between South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe countries are at odds over a ruling by Seoul\u2019s Supreme Court last month that a major Japanese steelmaker should compensate four South Koreans for forced labor during Japan\u2019s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II.\n\nSeoul has also expressed resentment about Tokyo\u2019s territorial claims over the disputed eastern islands occupied by South Korea. Japan last month refused to send a warship to an international fleet review hosted by South Korea after Seoul requested the removal of the Japanese navy\u2019s \u201crising sun\u201d flag, which many South Koreans see as a symbol of Japan\u2019s wartime aggression.\n\nSeoul and Tokyo\u2019s bitter disputes over history have complicated Washington\u2019s efforts to strengthen trilateral cooperation to deal with North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat and China\u2019s growing influence in the region. Japan has also expressed wariness over South Korea\u2019s outreach to rival North Korea in past months, stressing the need to maintain pressure until the North takes concrete steps toward relinquishing its nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\n\u201cThe Moon government is trying to maintain a two-track approach \u2014 cooperating with Tokyo on security and economic issues, but firmly responding to issues surrounding history and territorial claims,\u201d said Bong Young-shik, an analyst at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University.\n\n___\n\nYamaguchi reported from Tokyo.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Chau, who kayaked to the remote island populated by a tribe known for shooting at outsiders with bows and arrows, has been killed, police said Wednesday, Nov. 21. Officials said they were working with anthropologists to recover the body. (Sarah Prince/Associated Press)\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Indian authorities were struggling Thursday to figure out how to recover the body of an American who was killed after wading ashore on an island cut off from the modern world.\n\nJohn Allen Chau was killed last week by North Sentinel islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach, police say.\n\nBut even officials don\u2019t travel to North Sentinel, where people live as their ancestors did thousands of years ago, and where outsiders are seen with suspicion and attacked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult proposition,\u201d said Dependera Pathak, director-general of police on India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where North Sentinel is located. \u201cWe have to see what is possible, taking utmost care of the sensitivity of the group and the legal requirements.\u201d\n\nPolice are consulting anthropologists, tribal welfare experts and scholars to figure out a way to recover the body, he said.\n\nWhile visits to the island are heavily restricted, Chau paid fishermen last week to take him near North Sentinel, using a kayak to paddle to shore and bringing gifts including a football and fish.\n\nIt was \u201ca foolish adventure,\u201d said P.C. Joshi, an anthropology professor at Delhi University who has studied the islands. \u201cHe invited that aggression.\u201d\n\nJoshi noted that the visit not only risked Chau\u2019s life, but also the lives of islanders who have little resistance to many diseases.\n\n\u201cThey are not immune to anything. A simple thing like flu can kill them,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his first day Chau interacted with some tribesmen - who survive by hunting, fishing and collecting wild plants - until they became angry and shot an arrow at him. The 26-year-old self-styled adventurer and Christian missionary then swam back to the fishermen\u2019s boat waiting at a safe distance.\n\nThat night, he wrote about his visit and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to North Sentinel the next day, Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn\u2019t known, but on the morning of the following day, the fishermen watched from the boat as tribesmen dragged Chau\u2019s body along the beach and buried his remains.\n\nPathak said seven people have been arrested for helping Chau, including five fishermen, a friend of Chau\u2019s and a local tourist guide.\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can\u2019t be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak said.\n\nHe also said the police were examining whether Chau had tried earlier to visit the isolated island.\n\nPathak said Chau and his accomplices planned well for last week\u2019s visit by \u201ccamouflaging the visit as fishing.\u201d\n\nAlso, Chau appeared to be full of confidence as he wrote in his notes, \u201cGod sheltered him from coastguard and Navy,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an Instagram post, his family said it was mourning him as a \u201cbeloved son, brother, uncle and best friend to us.\u201d The family also said it forgave his killers and called for the release of those who assisted him in his quest to reach the island.\n\n\u201cHe ventured out on his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,\u201d the family said.\n\nAuthorities say Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed on another island while he prepared to travel to North Sentinel. It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman islands in 2015 and 2016.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the island chain, where they broke the news to Chau\u2019s friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nPolice surveyed the island by air Tuesday, and a team of police and forest department officials used a coast guard boat to travel there Wednesday. Another trip was planned Thursday.\n\nIndia has a hands-off approach to the island\u2019s people. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore, but Indian media reports say officials did not investigate or prosecute anyone in the deaths.\n\nIndia recently changed some of its rules on visiting isolated regions in the Andamans. While special permits are required, scholars say visits are now theoretically allowed in some parts of the Andamans where they used to be entirely forbidden, including North Sentinel. Chau had no permit, police said.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Christianity with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on tours of Israel to affirm their Christian faith. Chau went through that program in 2015.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t go there for just adventure. I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them,\u201d Staver said.\n\nStaver said Chau\u2019s last notes to his family on Nov. 16 told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School.

(Ivan Valencia/Associated Press)\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Colombian officials are hoping to quash tensions at a Venezuelan migrant camp with a game both the new arrivals and their hosts share a passion for: soccer.\n\nMigrants faced off against Colombian aid workers in a tournament Wednesday, two days after over a dozen Venezuelans were expelled from the camp after a violent protest over food rations.\n\nThat incident, in which some migrants looted supplies and clashed with riot police, marked a rocky start for Colombia\u2019s first official camp for Venezuelan migrants, who have flooded the neighboring Andean nation fleeing their own country\u2019s economic and humanitarian calamity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good after what happened a few days ago that we could interact with the people here in Colombia,\u201d said Carlos Uriel, a Venezuelan migrant playing in the tournament.\n\nMigrants cheered from a small concrete stand as eight-person teams named after famous clubs like Barcelona and Real Madrid clashed on a sunbaked field across from the camp.\n\nDuring a break between games, three young men burst into an acrobatic break dance, making the crowd roar in delight.\n\n\u201cThis really relaxes you,\u201d said Agustin Perez, 52, a migrant playing for a team called Los Vinotinto, the nickname used by Venezuela\u2019s national squad.\n\nColombian authorities had been hesitant to set up a refugee-style camp for Venezuelan migrants, fearful that it would become a permanent home for many and hinder their integration into society. But after several hundred homeless migrants set up an informal encampment in a park outside a bus terminal in Bogota, officials decided that offering tents and services was a better alternative.\n\nSome neighbors disagreed. As the Venezuelans were arriving at the encampment, people shouted at them from nearby apartment buildings and accused them of bringing in crime and disease.\n\nLiliana Pulido, director of district planning for Bogota\u2019s mayoral office, said authorities are now looking for ways to facilitate meaningful encounters between the Venezuelan migrants and Colombian citizens.\n\nPerez said that many migrants at the camp are still unhappy with the food provided by the city, which has been mostly limited to sandwiches and a piece of fruit. But he said that conditions had been improving since Monday\u2019s protest.\n\n\u201cWe finally had a hot meal yesterday, with chicken,\u201d he said.\n\nCity officials have warned that the camp will only function for three months, and they are hoping that in that time, its residents will be able to find work and pay for their own accommodation elsewhere. But many at the camp worry they won\u2019t be able to find jobs until they can legalize their status.\n\nColombia is currently home to more than 1 million Venezuelan migrants and refugees who have fled hyperinflation and food shortages at home. Officials suspect that number could potentially multiply in the years ahead.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Eric Gay/AP)\n\nThe Trump administration has given U.S. troops along the southern border permission to use force in protection of federal Border Patrol agents, but there has been no decision to alter the military\u2019s mission there, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Wednesday.\n\nMattis, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, said he was reviewing an order the White House issued late Tuesday for service members deployed in support of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel in Texas, Arizona and California.\n\nAccording to the order, signed by White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, military personnel may use \u201ca show or use of force (including lethal force, where necessary), crowd control, temporary detention and cursory search\u201d to protect CBP.\n\n\u201cIt is not an unreasonable concern on the part of the president that we may have to back up Border Patrol,\u201d Mattis said, citing skirmishes between Mexican authorities and migrants on that country\u2019s border with Central America earlier this fall.\n\nBut he said he had not altered the orders of the approximately 5,800 active-duty troops arrayed across the southern border, most of whom are not armed and have been performing functions such as stringing concertina wire, building barriers and transporting Border Patrol agents.\n\n[General in charge of border mission wants to begin redeploying troops]\n\nMattis has repeatedly defended President Trump\u2019s decision to use active-duty military personnel to harden the southern border, a move that Democrats characterized as a political stunt ahead of midterm elections earlier this month. The president remains focused on the caravans of mostly Central American migrants who are approaching the southern border from Mexico with hopes of seeking asylum in the United States. Trump has labeled them a threat to national security.\n\nCritics have raised questions about the need to use active-duty troops for a mission already involving Border Patrol agents and National Guard personnel, citing concerns the deployment could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, a law limiting military activities within the United States.\n\nHogan Gidley, the deputy White House press secretary, said the new order \u201censures the Department of Defense can step in to protect those who protect us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe brave men and women at Customs [and] Border Protection willingly put themselves in extremely dangerous situations every day to protect Americans and their families,\u201d Gidley said in a statement.\n\nMattis said the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection activities, had not asked for troops to use force to protect its personnel and that he would assess any such request if it were made. Most active-duty troops along the border do not carry firearms, Mattis said. If they were tasked with protecting CBP, they would probably use shields and batons, he said.\n\n[At the border, uncertainty about the migrant caravan and concertina wire]\n\nMattis and other Pentagon officials have sought to depict the role of U.S. troops as secondary to CBP, and they minimized the likelihood military personnel would need to use force in the way they do when deployed overseas.\n\n\u201cWe are not doing law enforcement. We do not have arrest authority,\u201d Mattis said. He said troops might take custody of individuals for a short time if someone attacked a CBP officer and troops were asked to respond. \u201cThis is minutes, not even hours,\u201d he said.\n\nMattis dismissed concerns about potential legal violations. \u201cRelax. Don\u2019t worry about it, okay?\u201d he said.\n\nSome civil liberties and human rights groups, though, criticized the administration\u2019s latest move. \u201cThis legally dubious \u2018cabinet order\u2019 creates confusion, undermines morale, and may very well lead to violence,\u201d Michael Breen, president of Human Rights First, said in a statement.\n\n[Mattis calls border deployment \u2018great training\u2019 as he visits troops in Texas]\n\nMattis said it wasn\u2019t yet clear whether the border mission would be extended beyond its current end date of Dec. 15 or if the new White House order would necessitate sending additional troops to the border. Earlier this week, the Army general leading the border mission signaled his interest in beginning to wind it down.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Mattis said he expected the active-duty deployment to cost more than the $72 million estimate the Pentagon released the day before. That\u2019s in addition to the $103 million the Pentagon spent to deploy the National Guard to the border from April 10 to Sept. 30, and the $308 million the Pentagon expects to spend on the Guard deployment from October through the end of September next year.\n\nAll told, the cost of both the active-duty and National Guard deployments looks set to total more than $483 million by the end of this fiscal year in late September 2019.\n\nNick Miroff in Washington and Josh Dawsey in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "E.J.

The act of gratitude is a declaration that we owe a great deal to others \u2014 to our families and friends, to our communities and our country, and, for believers, to the Almighty above all.\n\nThanksgiving is thus, at once, the most traditional of holidays and the most radical. It certainly evokes Norman Rockwell paintings of hearth and home, of a nation united by long-established rituals around a table of plenty.\n\nIt is also the day on which our dedication to accomplishment and striving gives way to a reality we only occasionally acknowledge: Even the best things we do are contingent on support and help from others, and on social circumstances that make our successes possible.\n\nAmong the gifts for which many of us express appreciation is our presence in a very fortunate land. Ours is certainly not the only lucky country, but it\u2019s undeniable that being born or raised here, or arriving later in life, affords opportunities much harder to come by in so many other parts of the world. I have deep affection for other countries, but I love this one and am very glad I was born here.\n\nBut we do not partake equally in this good fortune. Countless Americans will have no Thanksgiving dinner at all. Others will rely on shelters or halfway houses, churches, synagogues or mosques. Historically, barriers of race, class and status have deprived individuals and entire groups of basic rights and their fair share of our abundance.\n\nWe can, of course, be grateful for another aspect of our inheritance: The freedom to organize, mobilize and speak out has allowed us to chip away at such injustices and heal some of the injuries they cause. But to make good on this, we have to recognize the imperfections in the first place.\n\nIndebtedness to a place thus entails neither blind praise nor arrogance about how great it is but a determination to see that it lives up to its potential and its promise. And here we might learn something from what those whose legacy we remember on this holiday \u2014 the Pilgrims and the Puritans \u2014 had to say about why they came here.\n\nMy recommended Thanksgiving reading is \u201cAs a City on a Hill,\u201d Princeton University historian Daniel T. Rodgers\u2019s new book. Rodgers (who offered a helpful short version of his argument last week in The Post\u2019s Made by History section) tells the story of John Winthrop\u2019s celebrated 1630 sermon, \u201cA Model of Christian Charity,\u201d delivered to Puritans about to arrive on the shores of what became the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\nRodgers traces the path of Winthrop\u2019s words through our subsequent history and shows how they became central to the rhetorical repertoire of our politics thanks to Ronald Reagan. The Gipper added an adjective when he described \u201ca shining city upon a hill\u201d and cast it as \u201ca tall proud city, built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace.\u201d It\u2019s a lovely reminder when we need it that presidents have typically lifted up the virtue of harmony when describing our diversity.\n\nBut Rodgers argues that a proper understanding of Winthrop requires us to see his homily not as a precursor to proclamations about American exceptionalism but as a warning and a set of moral demands upon \u201ca covenanted people\u201d who bore \u201cthe burdens of visibility.\u201d\n\nThis leads, Rodgers observes, to the obligation \u201cto live as if one\u2019s society was under the moral scrutiny of the world, as if the eyes of all people were trained on it: What responsibility could be heavier?\u201d It\u2019s a compelling question at this particular moment in our national life.\n\nAlso telling is Rodgers\u2019s observation about the \u201caching tension\u201d in the document \u201cbetween the social fact of inequality and Winthrop\u2019s yearning for a community rooted in love.\u201d The \u201cdemands of charity,\u201d the historian notes, are at the sermon\u2019s \u201cinner heart.\u201d\n\nGod created differences, Winthrop avowed, so that \u201cevery man might have need of others, and from hence they might be all knit more nearly together in the Bonds of brotherly affection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must delight in each other,\u201d the communally minded Winthrop declared, \u201cmake others\u2019 conditions our own, rejoice together, mourn together, labor and suffer together, always having before our eyes our commission and community . . . as members of the same body.\u201d\n\nWhich is both what we seek and what we honor around our tables of thankfulness.\n\nRead more from E.J.

(Hani Mohammed/AP)\n\nThe powerful U.S. defense industry is facing a rare challenge to its influence on Capitol Hill as support for arms sales to Saudi Arabia has rapidly eroded following the killing last month of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi government operatives.\n\nThe defense industry\u2019s typically aggressive lobby has gone quiet as gruesome details of Khashoggi\u2019s death have leaked and American intelligence officials have laid blame at the feet of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nEven as President Trump has reiterated his support for continued sales of U.S. weapons to the kingdom, congressional opposition to those sales and to U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen has mounted in recent weeks \u2014 testing the power of an industry that has sold tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of weapons systems to the kingdom since the 1950s.\n\nGrowing bipartisan support for Senate legislation to cut off the arms sales marks a historic disruption in a seemingly inviolable arms-for-oil trade relationship that stretches back decades and is an unusual setback for one of the most influential lobbies in Washington.\n\nIn the coming weeks, key senators are expected to push for a vote on a measure that would impose sanctions on Saudi officials responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death and suspend many weapons sales to Saudi Arabia until it ceases airstrikes in Yemen that have killed tens of thousands of civilians.\n\nThe bill represents one of the first major breaks between congressional Republicans and the White House, which has embraced Saudi Arabia as a key Middle Eastern ally \u2014 a strategy driven by Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, who forged a strong personal relationship with the crown prince.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s staunch support for the kingdom in the face of the CIA\u2019s conclusion that Mohammed ordered the assassination of Khashoggi \u2014 a Washington Post contributing columnist \u2014 has triggered a backlash on Capitol Hill amid intensifying opposition to the war in Yemen.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump confidant who previously opposed efforts to restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia, suggested lawmakers might tie federal funding to Saudi sanctions. He is co-sponsoring the bipartisan Senate measure, which would suspend licenses for some weapons that had been previously approved.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the crown prince, it is not wise to look away,\u201d said Graham, calling the crown prince \u201ca wrecking ball\u201d on the global stage.\n\nOther lawmakers who have backed arms deals with Saudi Arabia in the past and are now reconsidering their support include Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), according to recent votes and congressional aides.\n\nIn the House, lawmakers are signing on to several proposals that would curtail Saudi deals, including one offered by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) that would mandate updates on the investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s death before any new military sales to Saudi Arabia could be considered.\n\nMcGovern\u2019s district is home to Raytheon, which sells hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia each year and whose corporate PAC has been a top campaign donor for McGovern in recent years.\n\n\u201cI care very much about jobs,\u201d said McGovern, who was an early critic of the war in Yemen. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to create jobs by selling weapons to governments that murder journalists in cold blood and then lie about it.\u201d\n\n[Inside the Saudis\u2019 Washington influence machine: Fierce lobbying and charm offensives]\n\nThe defense industry has long had a guiding hand on American foreign policy, facilitated by a parade of former military and government officials moving between corporate jobs and key State Department and Defense Department posts. U.S. defense companies have spent between $125 million and $130 million annually on lobbying in recent years, plus tens of millions more on contributions to federal candidates, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn a sign of the industry\u2019s muscle, Congress has only once voted to block a foreign arms deal through a key oversight tool known as a joint resolution of disapproval, according to a Congressional Research Service report. That effort occurred more than three decades ago, in 1986, and the measure was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nSince the start of the war in Yemen, the defense industry \u2014 working alongside lobbyists for Saudi Arabia \u2014 has successfully beat back congressional efforts, supported by human rights groups, to end or curtail U.S. support for the air war in that conflict.\n\nFor now, the defense lobby is keeping a low profile, stressing the value of a strong U.S.-Saudi relationship while strategizing how to proceed, according to people familiar with the approach. Industry lobbyists said they are closely monitoring the dynamics between top Saudi leaders and Trump, who has emerged as the industry\u2019s most vocal lobbyist, touting the economic importance of Saudi arms deals.\n\nOn Tuesday, the president suggested he might veto any congressional efforts to halt weapons sales. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars in orders and let Russia, China and everybody else have them,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nOfficials from Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics all declined The Post\u2019s requests for comment on the future of arms sales to Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\n[Trump again uses arms sales to justify Saudi ties, dragging U.S. defense contractors into an unwelcome debate]\n\nOne executive said defense contractors are waiting to see whether the crown prince will be replaced before determining a course of action.\n\nU.S. defense contractors \u201care really in a duck-and-cover mode, hoping to tie themselves to this as little as possible,\u201d said a prominent defense executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern that publicly discussing the issue would be bad for business. \u201cTo say that we\u2019re going to support this because we have a few thousand jobs at stake . . . we don\u2019t want that,\u201d the executive said.\n\nPressed by Wall Street analysts about the impact of Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance last month, officials from Raytheon and another major firm that sells arms to Saudi Arabia, Lockheed Martin, made only brief statements vowing to heed U.S. policy toward one of their top foreign clients.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident that we will weather this complexity,\u201d Raytheon chief executive Thomas Kennedy said in an earnings call, without mentioning Khashoggi\u2019s name.\n\nSigns of slipping support\n\nThe conflict that has ravaged one of the world\u2019s poorest countries pits the exiled Yemeni government, backed by the Saudi kingdom, against rebels known as Houthis, believed to be bolstered by Iran. U.S. assistance to the Saudi-led coalition, which began in 2015 under President Barack Obama, includes refueling planes, providing intelligence and logistical support \u2014 and selling bombs.\n\nIntense criticism of airstrikes on civilians led the administration to halt the sale of nearly $400 million in precision munitions guidance systems to Saudi Arabia in December 2016, at the end of the Obama administration. Three months later, the Trump administration reversed that decision and approved a resumption of weapons sales.\n\nSince then, weapons produced by American companies have been tied to some of the worst episodes of civilian casualties.\n\nThe bomb that killed more than 50 people, including at least 40 children, on a school-bus field trip on Aug. 9 was manufactured in the United States by Lockheed Martin, a CNN investigation found. Raytheon bombs have been blamed for other airstrikes that killed civilians, including an April 23 attack on a wedding that left 22 people dead. Post reporters and human rights groups have seen evidence that U.S.-made munitions have killed and maimed civilians in Yemen.\n\nAs the casualties increased, there were signs that congressional support for the war was slipping.\n\nIn mid-September, one month after the school-bus bombing, Raytheon\u2019s Kennedy stopped by Capitol Hill to see Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who had raised concerns about mounting casualties in Yemen, according to a congressional aide.\n\nFew American companies have benefited more from the Yemen war than Raytheon, a $25 billion-a-year defense giant, analysts said.\n\nAnd Menendez, exercising his power as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was delaying the sale of nearly $2 billion in bomb kits made by the company to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally.\n\nDespite the Raytheon CEO\u2019s personal visit, Menendez kept his hold on the sale. He is now sponsoring the bipartisan Senate bill that calls for suspension of many weapons sales to the kingdom.\n\nAsked about Raytheon\u2019s contacts with Menendez and other lawmakers, the company said, \u201cAs part of the government\u2019s decision-making process, Raytheon routinely engages with government officials to provide information and answer questions.\u201d Kennedy declined an interview request.\n\nSince Khashoggi\u2019s killing, contacts with key congressional offices by Raytheon lobbyists have dropped, according to aides.\n\n\u201cIf I was Raytheon or Boeing or Lockheed, I would keep my damn trap shut and my head low because this is bad for the Saudis,\u201d said a Republican Senate aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid about the defense lobby.\n\n[CIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s assassination]\n\nIn a call with investors last month, Raytheon\u2019s chief financial officer emphasized that the company\u2019s sales to Saudi Arabia amount to just 5 percent of overall revenue.\n\nBut such figures do not illustrate the full extent of the industry\u2019s dependence on the kingdom, one of the top foreign markets for U.S. defense companies, analysts said. Saudi Arabia spends billions of dollars every year on American-made weapons systems, and the kingdom has few of the bureaucratic checks and balances that delay big military purchases in the United States.\n\nLockheed has made selling to foreign governments a key target for growth, with Saudi Arabia a major driver of that effort, according to one defense analyst. A photo of the crown prince during his April visit to a Lockheed facility in Silicon Valley remains on the company\u2019s website, even as other corporations have distanced themselves from Mohammed since Khashoggi\u2019s slaying.\n\n\u201cThe importance of military sales to Saudi Arabia goes far beyond what the annual sales figures would indicate,\u201d said Peter Mandaville, a former State Department adviser who teaches at George Mason University. \u201cThose contracts over time keep assembly lines and supply chains open for the major defense contractors. When they are planning for the future, they always keep the Saudis in mind.\u201d\n\n'Take the long view'\n\nDespite the storm of controversy, former defense officials and national security analysts predict that the decades-long relationship with Saudi Arabia is likely to endure because of the kingdom\u2019s economic and strategic importance.\n\nHawk Carlisle, a retired Air Force general who helms the National Defense Industrial Association, an industry trade organization, said in an interview last month that while the United States must respond to Khashoggi\u2019s killing, it also must look out for national security.\n\n\u201cAs a nation we have to uphold our principles. We need to take appropriate action but not have an overreaction,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cWe need to take the long view.\u201d\n\nAfter Khashoggi\u2019s death, Raytheon board members convened at the company\u2019s Waltham, Mass., headquarters to consider how to handle the fallout and relations with Saudi Arabia, among other issues, according to people familiar with the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was led by Kennedy, 63, a former Air Force captain who has traveled the world selling Raytheon\u2019s wares to the Saudi crown prince and other international clients. The board advised Kennedy on that day to cancel a planned trip to an economic summit in Riyadh and send others in his place, the people familiar with the meeting said.\n\nA Raytheon spokesman called the board meeting \u201ca regular part of our governance process.\u201d\n\nRaytheon\u2019s board includes some of the most influential figures in the world of military strategy and intelligence: Stephen J. Hadley, national security adviser to President George W. Bush; Robert O. Work, who stepped down last year as deputy defense secretary for planning; Letitia A. Long, a veteran of the top echelons of U.S. defense and intelligence agencies; and retired Adm. Vernon Clark, former chief of naval operations.\n\n[Almost two years into Trump presidency, Pentagon\u2019s revolving door still spins]\n\nThe revolving door has also gone the other way, as former industry supporters have secured key government positions.\n\nAt the State Department, Charles Faulkner, a registered Raytheon lobbyist from 2012 to 2016 when he worked for the firm BGR Group, now serves as acting assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs.\n\nThis fall, his bureau urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to certify that Saudi Arabia and the UAE were working to reduce civilian casualties, warning that holding back support for the kingdom \u2014 as other State Department officials were urging \u2014 could jeopardize future weapon sales, as the Intercept first reported.\n\nPompeo sided with Faulkner\u2019s bureau and allowed the weapons sales to go forward, as the Wall Street Journal first reported.\n\n\u201cMr. Faulkner has extensive experience working with Capitol Hill,\u201d said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. \u201cHis previous positions, however, have no bearing on the final certification decision.\u201d\n\nA building showdown\n\nAs congressional criticism has intensified, there have been signs that the Trump administration\u2019s appetite for the war is diminishing. Last week, the United States confirmed it was ending the practice of providing aerial refueling to Saudi-coalition aircraft. And Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis recently called for a cease-fire amid warnings the war has left half the population on the brink of starvation.\n\nMattis said Wednesday that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had ceased airstrikes and other offensive operations over the past three days in Yemen in anticipation of U.N.-sponsored peace talks.\n\nStill, Trump has steadfastly refused to block what he has misleadingly described as $110 billion in military sales to the kingdom. (That figure includes deals that were laid out in nonbinding memos, were previously announced by the Obama administration or are for equipment scheduled for delivery after 2022 or at an undetermined date.)\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Trump questioned the CIA\u2019s conclusion that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing and said that his priority is to protect the trade relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. The kingdom keeps oil prices at \u201creasonable levels\u201d and provides cash for U.S. arms that translates into U.S. jobs, Trump said.\n\n\u201cIf we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so.\u201d\n\n[For Trump, the bottom line on Saudi Arabia takes precedence over human rights]\n\nMany congressional lawmakers \u2014 including some Republicans \u2014 reacted with disgust at his dismissal of the CIA\u2019s assessment.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,\u201d Sen. Bob Corker (R.-Tenn.) tweeted.\n\nThe dynamic is setting up a showdown between Trump and Congress as pressure to curtail Saudi arms deals and the U.S. role in Yemen builds from human rights groups and some conservatives. The Charles Koch Institute, a nonprofit group founded by the billionaire libertarian industrialist, has been warning a bipartisan group of lawmakers about the consequences of continued U.S. involvement in Yemen, foundation officials said.\n\nSen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) \u2014 who with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) is challenging the State Department\u2019s decision in September to certify that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are trying to protect civilians from harm \u2014 said the rising civilian casualties in Yemen should take precedent over the industry\u2019s financial interests.\n\n\u201cEconomic interests are important, but they are not the most important thing,\u201d Young said.\n\nAlice Crites, Christian Davenport, Karen DeYoung, Karoun Demirjian, Aaron Gregg and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nInside the Saudi influence machine in Washington\n\nSaudi role in Yemen war under increasing scrutiny\n\nU.S. says the time to end the Saudi-led war in Yemen is now"}]
