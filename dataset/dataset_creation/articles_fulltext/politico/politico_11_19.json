The administration suspended most of its military aid to Pakistan at the beginning of this year for its failure to act against terrorist groups.\n\nThe U.S. also excluded Pakistani officers from the International Military Education and Training Program and was successful in getting Pakistan back on the global Financial Action Task Force\u2019s gray list, which includes countries that have failed to curb terrorist financing.\n\nThe United States has long complained about Pakistan\u2019s military and intelligence agencies playing a double game in the region, protecting some militant groups while taking on others. Pakistan has consistently denied these allegations but also maintained that its top priority is to protect its own strategic interest, which is believed to include keeping relationships with proxy forces that can aid Pakistan in a fight against India. Pakistanis also are quick to point to America\u2019s own unholy alliances, including its support for the Taliban\u2019s forebears in Afghanistan.\n\nHere\u2019s the full exchange between the two leaders.\n\nPresident Trump on FOX News:\n\n\u201cFrankly, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that? Wouldn\u2019t it have been nice? Think of this, living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan in what I guess they considered a nice mansion \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve seen nicer \u2014 but living in Pakistan, right next to the military academy. Everybody in Pakistan knew he was there. And we give Pakistan $1.3 billion a year and they don\u2019t tell him, they don\u2019t tell him for years?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe lived in Pakistan. We\u2019re supporting Pakistan. We\u2019re giving them $1.3 billion a year, which we don\u2019t give them anymore by the way. I ended it because they don\u2019t do anything for us, they don\u2019t do a damn thing for us.\u201d\n\nKhan responded Monday morning on Twitter:\n\nRecord needs to be put straight on Mr Trump's tirade against Pakistan: 1. No Pakistani was involved in 9/11 but Pak decided to participate in US War on Terror. 2. Pakistan suffered 75,000 casualties in this war & over $123 bn was lost to economy. US \"aid\" was a miniscule $20 bn. \u2014 Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) November 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Our tribal areas were devastated & millions of ppl uprooted from their homes. The war drastically impacted lives of ordinary Pakistanis. 4. Pak continues to provide free lines of ground & air communications(GLOCs/ALOCs).Can Mr Trump name another ally that gave such sacrifices? \u2014 Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) November 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of making Pakistan a scapegoat for their failures, the US should do a serious assessment of why, despite 140000 NATO troops plus 250,000 Afghan troops & reportedly $1 trillion spent on war in Afghanistan, the Taliban today are stronger than before. \u2014 Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) November 19, 2018\n\nTrump then sent out his own set of tweets:\n\nOf course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n....We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another. They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return. That\u2019s ENDING! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2018\n\nAn hour later, Khan responded with a final tweet:\n\nTrump\u2019s false assertions add insult to the injury Pak has suffered in US WoT in terms of lives lost & destabilised & economic costs. He needs to be informed abt historical facts. Pak has suffered enough fighting US's war.

But the panel largely ignored the elephant in the room during the hearing \u2014 Whitaker\u2019s appointment as Mueller's boss, which had happened the day earlier.\n\nPreviously, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had overseen the probe since Sessions recused himself due to his involvement in Trump's campaign.\n\nMiller\u2019s overall case stems from his decision to resist two sets of Mueller grand jury subpoenas to create a legal vehicle to challenge the special counsel\u2019s authority to investigate potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nAfter the court hearing, the judges ordered an extra round of legal briefs asking both sides to account for Whitaker's new role as Mueller's supervisor, where he has authority over the special counsel's major decisions, including subpoenas, indictments and the public release of a final report\n\nBut both sides replied that Whitaker didn\u2019t matter for their case.\n\nIn a 10-page brief , Miller attorney Paul Kamenar shrugged off the Whitaker appointment and fell back on his original legal argument: Mueller was an unlawful prosecutor because Trump didn\u2019t appoint him and he had not undergone Senate confirmation.\n\nAttempting to head off an argument that Miller\u2019s lawyers ultimately didn\u2019t make, Dreeben in his brief referenced a memo released last week by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel that explained how Trump had the authority to make Whitaker's appointment.\n\nDreeben also argued the appellate court wouldn\u2019t have been the right venue to challenge the Whitaker decision anyway. And if Miller\u2019s lawyers had successfully argued that the Whitaker appointment mattered to their case, Dreeben said it would have set off a chain reaction putting Rosenstein back in the role of acting attorney general.\n\nMiller\u2019s attorneys have signaled they want to see their case taken all the way to the Supreme Court, where a conservative majority that includes new Justice Brett Kavanaugh would be a more receptive audience.\n\nBut that fight is likely to take months with no guarantee it will even get a hearing before the Supreme Court.\n\nTo date, challenges against Mueller\u2019s authority have gone nowhere. The federal judges presiding over separate criminal cases against Paul Manafort issued rulings rejecting the former Trump campaign chairman\u2019s bid to toss out the charges by claiming Mueller\u2019s appointment was flawed.\n\nAnd a federal judge appointed by Trump rejected an attempt by a Russian company challenging Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction after the firm was charged in connection with a Kremlin-linked online troll farm accused of targeting the 2016 U.S. election."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "nkorecki@politico.com (Natasha Korecki)", "title": "Bernie Sanders to huddle with progressive leaders in Burlington", "description": "Sanders will not make any announcement about his plans for a potential 2020 campaign, sources said.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/19/bernie-sanders-progressive-leaders-vermont-1005505", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/0a/38/dc9c37044d588b9f75e49b92a5a8/181119-bernie-sanders.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:21:00Z", "content": "The Sanders Institute event coincides with the release of Sen.

The recusals have expired for four of them, allowing Bernhardt to plunge into policymaking that has prompted critics to say he is helping his former clients.\n\n\u2014 \u201cAs a partner at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Bernhardt represented clients such as the Westlands Water District, which provides water to California farmers. ... On Aug. 17, two weeks after Bernhardt\u2019s recusal over Westlands Water District expired, [Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke] tasked him with drafting a new plan for managing federal and state water supplies there. Interior and California officials have been tight-lipped about ongoing negotiations, but Bernhardt and his colleagues have made clear they hope to overhaul existing agreements to provide more water to agricultural interests. Even before the recusal period ended, Bernhardt addressed a meeting of the Association of California Water Agencies and met with Interior officials working on the state\u2019s water issues.\u201d Full story.\n\nBIG DONORS SEE PATH TO BEATING TRUMP IN 2020: \u201cAs the debate rages among Democrats about how best to position the party to defeat President Trump in 2020, many big donors are signaling early support for expanding and firing up the party\u2019s liberal base rather than backing centrist appeals targeting the Rust Belt,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Kenneth Vogel reports. \u201cEven though middle-of-the-road Democrats helped propel the party to broad gains in the House in the midterm elections this month, especially in coastal suburbs, influential donors signaled in postelection meetings that their priority would be to back progressive appeals in Sun Belt states. \u2026 \u2018Once we expand the electorate in these places, there will be no turning back,\u2019 said Tory Gavito, the president and co-founder of a new coalition of mostly female donors called Way to Win.\n\n\u2014 \u201cShe made her case in presentations to major donors at a conference sponsored by WDN Action, the political arm of the Women Donors Network, earlier this month in Seattle and this past week at another put on by the Democracy Alliance, an organization that includes some of the party\u2019s wealthiest and most influential donors.

The tobacco companies have decades of practice in fighting off challenges to their marketing practices and even though tobacco is the single biggest killer globally, it remains legal everywhere. \u201cWith this week\u2019s announcement, the agency threw the gauntlet down to three large industries: traditional Big Tobacco, a growing e-cigarette industry, and retailers.

Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Jason Crow of Colorado.\n\nThat would bring Pelosi\u2019s opponents to a total of 19 members or members-elect committed to voting against her \u2014 enough to keep her from becoming speaker should those members refuse to budge.\n\nThree House races in Utah, Georgia and Texas have not been called but are trending toward the Republican incumbents. Should Democrats prevail, Pelosi could have more wiggle room and could lose as many as 18 votes.\n\nPelosi has defiantly said she will win a speaker vote and has no intention of withdrawing. Her allies predict she will take this fight all the way to the House floor and will wear down her opponents.\n\n\u201cLeader Pelosi remains confident in her support among members and members-elect,\u201d Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in response, noting that 94 percent of the caucus didn\u2019t sign onto the letter.\n\nMonday\u2019s letter, however, suggests that Pelosi\u2019s pressure campaign to wrestle the needed votes has so far fallen short, though her allies note that they still have more than a month to crank up the heat and get these critics in line.\n\nRep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), one of the group's ringleaders, dismissed the criticism that only a handful of caucus members publicly signed onto the letter. Rice told POLITICO that Pelosi is likely to win a closed-door caucus vote next week \u2014 which only requires a majority of members to vote in her favor \u2014 but that the members vowing to oppose the California Democrat plan to stand firm on the floor.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is she might get the overwhelming votes of the caucus votes but there are enough votes to stop her from becoming speaker \u2014 and that\u2019s really all that matters,\" Rice said of Pelosi. \"And she knows that.\"\n\nIn addition to Rice, letter signers are Democratic Reps. Tim Ryan (Ohio), Seth Moulton (Massachusetts), Ed Perlmutter (Colorado), Kurt Schrader (Oregon), Filemon Vela (Texas), Bill Foster (Illinois), Brian Higgins (New York), Stephen Lynch (Massachusetts), Linda S\u00e1nchez (California) and Jim Cooper (Tennessee), as well as Reps.-elect Jeff Van Drew (New Jersey), Joe Cunningham (South Carolina), Max Rose and Anthony Brindisi of New York, and candidate McAdams.\n\nPelosi has isolated some threats against her. Several dozen Democratic candidates, for example, ran and were elected on a promise to oppose her or back \u201cnew leadership.\u201d Pelosi has been meeting with these members and appears to be making gains with a group of them.\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, for example, vowed during the campaign to oppose Pelosi, even running a commercial saying so. But Pelosi\u2019s allies have been working on Sherrill, who no longer publicly reiterates those intentions.\n\nAdditionally, Pelosi's critics had been trying for weeks to garner 20 signatories on their letter. They fell short of their own goal by four names \u2014 five if McAdams is excluded.\n\nStill there's no denying the gravity of the predicament before Pelosi. And simple math suggests that the minority leader will have to cut some sort of deal with her critics.\n\nMany of the letter\u2019s signers have told POLITICO that nothing can make them change their mind \u2014 no plum committee posts or chairmanship, as have been used as a carrot for Pelosi critics in the past. Van Drew told POLITICO last week that he would not change his mind for anything.\n\n\"I expressed my view, and I\u2019m not going to be voting for her \u2014 not in caucus and not on the floor,\" he said.\n\nBut Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, a Pelosi critic who is considering a bid for speaker as well, suggested to POLITICO in a Friday interview that Pelosi could possibly win her support should the Californian declare that she will serve for only one more term. Fudge had signed an earlier version of the letter but apparently has withdrawn her signature; she was not on the letter released Monday.\n\n\u201cWe talked about some succession plan,\" Fudge said after meeting with Pelosi on Friday to discuss her potential challenge to the leader. Senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus were trying to broker peace between the two. \u201cI\u2019d like to know what her plans are [for retirement]. She did not share them with me. But I think that it is something that our caucus is interested in finding out.\u201d\n\nThe threat by Pelosi\u2019s critics \u2014 whom some on Capitol Hill have dubbed the \u201crebels\u201d or the \u201crevolutionaries\u201d \u2014 has the potential to throw the entire party into chaos just as Democrats are trying to turn their fire on President Donald Trump and pivot toward ousting him in 2020.\n\nIt's irritated many in the caucus who say they should be fighting Republicans, not each other, and who argue that Pelosi has the know-how to lead the party at such a critical time.\n\nBut Pelosi opponents say she has hindered the party and will put newly elected members in red or purple districts in political jeopardy should she force incoming freshmen to vote for her.\n\n\"This is where we stand, this is how we\u2019re going to vote. We heard the voters on Nov. 6, and we are going to help bring about change, even if it comes at some political cost here to us in Washington,\" Rice said.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "lwoellert@politico.com (Lorraine Woellert)", "title": "Liberal watchdog group asks FTC to probe Trump's involvement with company", "description": "A lawsuit had claimed Trump and his family accepted millions of dollars from the company in exchange for promoting it in speeches and other public appearances.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/19/watchdog-group-ftc-probe-trump-1005365", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/2a/8d/38f441eb411ebf13825ac4af35aa/181119-donald-trump-2-gty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:33:20Z", "content": "In interviews and on his reality television show The Apprentice, President Donald Trump has said he didnt promote ACN in exchange for money and called ACN executives his friends. | Tasos Katopodis-Pool/Getty Images A liberal watchdog group on Monday asked the\u2026 [+2249 chars]", "fulltext": "In interviews and on his reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d, President Donald Trump has said he didn\u2019t promote ACN in exchange for money and called ACN executives his \u201cfriends.\u201d | Tasos Katopodis-Pool/Getty Images Legal Liberal watchdog group asks FTC to probe Trump's involvement with company\n\nA liberal watchdog group on Monday asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate President Donald Trump\u2019s involvement with a company that he has been accused of promoting to investors in unfair get-rich-quick schemes.\n\nPublic Citizen, a consumer group that has often criticized the president, said in a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons that Trump and his family members failed to disclose that they were paid to endorse the company, American Communications Network, or ACN, in violation of FTC rules.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe complaint follows a lawsuit filed in federal court against Trump in October on behalf of investors in ACN.

While I have never been mistaken for a stand-up comedian, I promise that my history lesson won\u2019t be dry.\u201d\n\nALERT \u2026 THE GROUP of 17 or so \u201crebels\u201d planning to vote against NANCY PELOSI intends to release their letter this afternoon, according to sources familiar with the decision-making process. We\u2019ve heard this before: they have mulled releasing the letter, only to pull back.\n\nWE GOT OUR HANDS ON a copy of the letter. This, of course like everything else, is subject to change. It\u2019s not clear whether they\u2019ve updated the language in the last few days.: \u201cWe are thankful to Leader Pelosi for her years of service to our Country and to our Caucus. She is an historic figure whose leadership has been instrumental to some of our party's most important legislative achievements.\n\n\u201cHowever, we also recognize that in this recent election, Democrats ran and won on a message of change. Our majority came on the backs of candidates who said that they would support new leadership because voters in hard-won districts, and across the country, want to see real change in Washington. We promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise. Therefore, we are committed to voting for new leadership in both our Caucus meeting and on the House Floor.\u201d\n\n-- THIS LETTER LEAVES a tiny bit of wiggle room. \u201cCommitted\u201d is not as firm as \u201cwe will.\u201d Nitpicky, but important.\n\nCOLORADO REP.

You Have to Take it From Them'\"): \u201cThis second speakership would make her the principal counterweight to a president she unabashedly described to me as \u2018a very dangerous man.\u2019 It would also most likely be the final act of the 78-year-old legislator\u2019s long career as the most powerful woman in the history of American politics.\n\n\u201cIn interviews, she has audaciously declared herself to be a \u2018master legislator\u2019; issued policy statements on behalf of the Democratic caucus; and implicitly dared any challenger to make themselves known while also quelling opposition to her speakership by hinting in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in October that she was open to being a \u2018transitional figure.\u2019 When I asked Pelosi about this olive branch two weeks later, however, she abruptly walked it back: \u2018I think every leader is a transitional figure.\u2019\u201d NYT Magazine\n\nW.H.

McRaven for being a \"Hillary Clinton fan\" and for not catching bin Laden more quickly. McRaven oversaw the U.S. military operation in which bin Laden was killed and a treasure-trove of Al Qaeda documents was uncovered.\n\nThe operation ended a nearly decadelong manhunt for the Al Qaeda leader responsible for ordering the 9/11 attacks, who hid in a compound in Pakistan and orchestrated byzantine rules to conceal his location.

We all wanted to get him as soon as we could.\"\n\nO'Neill joined Fox News as a contributor in 2015, and has spoken both in support of Trump's actions, such as defending his then-nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, as well as condemning some of Trump's more theatrical antics, calling Trump's planned military parade \"third world bull----.\"\n\nFormer CIA Director Leon Panetta, who oversaw the operation to locate bin Laden, criticized Trump's remarks during an MSNBC interview on Monday. When asked about the president's remarks on the length of the manhunt for bin Laden, Panetta laughed, later adding the mission was one of the \"proudest\" moments in U.S. military history.\n\nPanetta suggested Trump's criticisms were misdirected, pointing out the CIA did not notify McRaven about bin Laden's whereabouts until about three months before the operation to kill him.\n\n\"This president owes Adm. McRaven and all of the SEALs involved in that operation an apology for what he's saying,\" Panetta said. \"He's undermining his position as commander in chief, not only with those that conducted the operation, but with the entire military.\"\n\nTrump has previously claimed he knew about bin Laden before 9/11. At a 2015 rally, Trump claimed he warned about bin Laden in his 2000 book \"The America We Deserve,\" CBS News reported at the time. But a CBS fact check points out Trump merely mentioned bin Laden as an example of poor U.S. foreign policy, and did not warn or predict the terrorist attacks.\n\nBin Laden had also been known to U.S. intelligence long before 9/11.

As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary,\u201d CNN Communications said in a tweet Monday afternoon. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to cover the White House.\u201d\n\nAcosta tweeted, \u201cThanks to everybody for their support. As I said last Friday... let's get back to work.\u201d\n\nAcosta had his press credentials suspended following a fiery exchange with Trump in a news conference on Nov. 7, during which he resisted when a White House intern attempted to take a microphone out of his hands. The White House initially claimed, using an apparently altered video as evidence, that he inappropriately touched the intern. Officials later changed their rationale to say that Acosta had breached unwritten standards of decorum for the press.\n\nOn Friday, District Court Judge Timothy Kelly ruled that Acosta\u2019s due process rights had been violated because the White House had not given him any explanation of why his credentials were being revoked, nor had they given him a chance to appeal. Kelly ordered the White House to reinstate the hard pass for two weeks. The judge was careful to note that he had not ruled on whether the White House had violated Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights \u2014 specifically, whether the White House was truly targeting the reporter for his coverage and not his news conference behavior, as CNN argued.\n\nDuring the court proceedings, Department of Justice lawyers made the sweeping claim that the president has the authority to kick any reporter out of the White House for any reason \u2014 a major expansion of what\u2019s understood to be the president\u2019s power over the press. Legal experts were skeptical of the argument, citing a 1977 D.C. Circuit Court ruling that specifically prohibits expelling reporters \u201carbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons,\u201d but the judge never ruled on that argument direction.\n\nBefore the announcement Monday afternoon, White House officials appeared ready to keep fighting CNN tooth and nail over Acosta's security badge.\n\nWhite House officials sent notice to Acosta on Friday saying they had made a \"preliminary decision\" to revoke his press pass over his prior behavior and giving him a chance to contest the decision. CNN requested an emergency court hearing to ask Kelly to extend Acosta's press pass for more than the two weeks allowed in the initial order.\n\nMedia law experts were skeptical that a fresh White House attempt to separate Acosta from his security pass based on the same incident would survive in court. William Youmans, a media law professor at George Washington University, said he didn't think the White House\u2019s latest gambit to take away Acosta's pass would succeed because officials seemed to be attempting to create standards for reporter behavior after the fact. \u201cThey\u2019re just making it up as they go along,\u201d Youmans said.\n\nThe White House later reversed course and said it was restoring Acosta's press badge.\n\n\u201cThey got tired of the situation and have moved on,\u201d one former White House official said, adding, in reference to Acosta, \u201cThey\u2019re going to put in the new procedures and see if he sticks by them.\u201d\n\nSanders laid out four rules \u201cgoverning future press conferences\u201d in her statement.\n\nThe first states that a journalist who is called upon \u201cwill ask a single question and then yield the floor.\u201d\n\nThe second rule says that follow-ups may be granted \u201cat the discretion of the President or Other White House official\" taking questions.\n\nThe third defines \u201cyielding the floor,\u201d saying that includes \u201csurrendering the microphone to White House staff.\u201d During the encounter that prompted the White House to initially suspend Acosta\u2019s hard pass, he declined to give up the microphone to a press assistant who was trying to take it from him.\n\nThe final rule states that \u201cfailure to abide\u201d by any of the others \u201cmay result in suspension or revocation of the journalist\u2019s hard pass.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 statement also warned that there could be more rules to come.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful that a more elaborate and comprehensive set of rules might need to be devised, including, for example, for journalist conduct in the open (non-press room) areas inside and outside the White House and for Air Force One,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf unprofessional behavior occurs in those settings, or if a court should decide that explicit rules are required to regulate conduct there, we will be forced to reconsider this decision.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Acosta, obtained by POLITICO, Sanders laid out the rules and warned the reporter, \u201cShould you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will take action in accordance with the rules set forth above.\u201d\n\nLast week, White House Correspondents\u2019 Association president Olivier Knox said his organization has a \u201crole to play\u201d in creating any new rules for reporters\u2019 behavior, but he said Monday that the group was not consulted.\n\n\"The White House did the right thing in restoring Jim Acosta's hard pass,\" he said in a statement Monday evening. He added, \"For as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions. We fully expect the tradition will continue. We will continue to make the case that a free and independent news media plays a vital role in the health of our republic.\"\n\nTrump, in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace that aired Sunday, tipped that the White House was working on \u201crules and regulations\u201d that would govern the conduct of journalists, calling Friday\u2019s legal developments \u201cnot a big deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have rules of decorum, you know, you can\u2019t keep asking questions,\" he said. \"Look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do. And if I think somebody\u2019s acting out of sorts, I will leave. I\u2019ll say, 'Thank you very much, everybody, I appreciate you coming,' and I will leave.\u201d\n\nGabby Orr contributed to this report.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "rmorin@politico.com (Rebecca Morin)", "title": "Trump tries to shore up Hyde-Smith as controversy swirls around her Senate bid", "description": "The president will be hosting two rallies on Nov. 26, one in Tupelo and another in Biloxi.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/19/trump-supports-hyde-smith-1003296", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/db/52/7a63ba6040a0961333418606a304/181119-hyde-smith-trump-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:17:20Z", "content": "Sen.

Our next Morning Ag installment will publish on Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nIN THE HOPPER: In surveying the deadly wildfires in California, President Donald Trump promised $500 million in the farm bill for forest management and stressed the importance of working with environmental groups to improve forest maintenance.\n\n\u2014 The Agriculture Department and FDA have a plan for splitting up regulatory authority over cell-based protein products, but lawmakers who control the agencies\u2019 budgets have other ideas. A year-end budget battle could determine who wins out.\n\n\u2014 On tap today: The Environmental Working Group plans to release data on early recipients of USDA\u2019s tariff-relief program, including names and dollar figures.\n\n\u2014 Beyond the soda-tax wars: There\u2019s a broader effort to keep states from enacting food and nutrition laws \u2014 and to shield businesses from liability in obesity claims.\n\nFOREST FIRES AND THE FARM BILL: Trump took stock of the charred California landscape this weekend, pointing to rapid movement in farm bill talks and repeatedly referencing new forest management funds in the bill as one thing the federal government could do to limit future wildfire damage.\n\n\u201cIn the farm bill, we\u2019re putting quite a bit of money \u2014 about $500 million \u2014 in the farm bill for management and maintenance of the forests beyond this area,\u201d Trump said Saturday in Chico, Calif. \u201cThat will be in the farm bill. We just put it in. The farm bill is moving along pretty rapidly for our great farmers. But we have a new category and that\u2019s management and maintenance of the forests. It\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nMA had an early look last month at the heated debate between House Republicans and Senate Democrats over forestry provisions, including changes to wildfire-prevention efforts. House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway said on Friday that farm bill negotiators had not resolved forestry provisions, according to reports.\n\n\u2014 The \u201craking\u201d flap: In Paradise, Calif., Trump claimed Finland avoids devastating wildfires by diligently \u201craking\u201d its forest floors. (Finland\u2019s president says he never discussed raking with Trump, per POLITICO\u2019s Quint Forgey.) California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat who has sparred frequently with Trump, suggested the state needs to do more to thin its forests, the Sacramento Bee writes.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that the farm bill is moving along rapidly largely checks out. House Agriculture leaders sounded bullish Friday about closing in on a deal with the Senate, your host reported. Conaway and ranking member Collin Peterson said they sent their Senate counterparts an offer after reaching agreement on all 12 titles.\n\nFarm bill marathon: Committee staff worked through the weekend to help bring negotiators closer to agreement on the sweeping legislation, but they were tight-lipped about how much progress was made. Peterson apparently told a group of Minnesota farmers that a final deal on the House side could be reached as soon as Monday.\n\nHAPPY MONDAY, NOV. 19!

USDA would then handle oversight of food production and labeling. Your host has more details on the arrangement and the related appropriations fight.\n\n\u2014 The Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that supports the alternative protein sector, praised Perdue and Gottlieb for \u201cclearing the way for a transparent and predictable regulatory path forward.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Companies that are working on cell-based protein products, like Memphis Meats and JUST, are also backing the proposed division of responsibility (which is similar to what Memphis Meats and the North American Meat Institute suggested in a joint letter to Trump in August).\n\n\u2014 Memphis Meats CEO Uma Valeti said the plan \u201cplays to the respective strengths of both USDA and FDA, while continuing to foster innovation and assure a safe and reliable food system.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association said giving USDA \u201cprimary jurisdiction over the most important facets of lab-produced fake meat\u201d is \u201ca step in the right direction, but there is still a lot of work to do on this issue.\u201d\n\nApprops question TBD: It remains to be seen if House appropriators will drop their bid to give cell-based meat jurisdiction to USDA.\n\nTRADE-AID PAYMENTS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: The Environmental Working Group at noon today is set to make public the names of ag producers receiving payments through USDA\u2019s trade-assistance package. The group filed a FOIA request in late September to obtain the names and addresses of trade-aid recipients \u2014 and how much money each is getting.\n\nEWG\u2019s disclosure is likely to cover a fraction of total recipients, since most of the $4.7 billion that USDA set aside for the first round of direct payments is still sitting in federal coffers. (Reuters reported last week that just $840 million has trickled out to farmers so far.)\n\n\u2014 Issue to watch: EWG has frequently complained that city-dwellers who don\u2019t live or work on farms often still receive farm subsidies. Today\u2019s data dump is expected to show plenty of trade-aid payments flowing to residents of major metropolises like New York and San Francisco.\n\nThere\u2019s been some backlash against large ag companies benefiting from other pieces of the trade-assistance package, like the $1.2 billion commodity purchase program.\n\nUSDA canceled a $240,000 contract with Smithfield Foods after public complaints that the Chinese-owned pork-processing giant was set to receive taxpayer funds that were intended to help U.S. farmers and ranchers suffering from Beijing\u2019s retaliatory duties, our Catherine Boudreau reports. (Smithfield requested that the contract be terminated, and no funds had been transferred, according to USDA.)\n\nSTATE PREEMPTION LAWS UNDER FIRE: There\u2019s a broad effort underway to limit state and local governments\u2019 ability to enact food and nutrition policies like sugary drink taxes and nutrition labeling. A new study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine quantifies the trend: Between 2008 and March 2018, a dozen states enacted 13 preemption laws on food and nutrition. (Not included on this list: Washington state\u2019s initiative to block all food and beverage taxes, which voters approved earlier this month.)\n\n\u2014 There\u2019s also been a push to limit industry liability in potential obesity claims: Between 2003 and 2013, 26 states passed so-called Commonsense Food Consumption Acts, the study found.\n\n\u201cThe specific focus of all of these laws is to preempt lawsuits based on claims that a consumer\u2019s weight gain, obesity, or associated health conditions resulted from long-term consumption of food,\u201d the researchers write. Read the study here.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 NAFTA 2.0\u2019s hard climb on the Hill: The new North American trade pact is drawing fire from the right and the left, Pro Trade\u2019s Sabrina Rodriguez reports. Liberals say they want tougher environmental protections and higher labor standards in Mexico, while conservatives are protesting new protections in the deal for LGBT workers.\n\n\u2014 APEC meeting ends without joint statement: A clash between the U.S. and China over the future of the WTO prevented this weekend's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea from producing a joint statement for the first time since 1993 \u2014 a bad sign heading into Trump\u2019s expected meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 gathering later this month, our Pro Trade colleagues report. The main sticking point was whether the statement should include a reference to WTO changes, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill said during a closing press conference.\n\n\u2014 Rare trade criticism: China\u2019s former chief trade negotiator criticized as ill thought-out Beijing\u2019s decision to target U.S. soybeans, our content partners at the South China Morning Post report.\n\n\u2014 CDC corrects record on farmer suicides: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week issued new data and retracted a widely cited 2016 report that mistakenly said farmers had the highest rate of suicide of any U.S. worker in 2012. After a data-entry problem was corrected, construction and \u201cextraction\u201d workers (like miners) had the highest suicide rate in 2012 and again in 2015, Pro Ag\u2019s John Lauinger reports.\n\n\u2014 Grassley chooses Senate Finance gavel: Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley will make the jump to the Finance Committee chairmanship, where he\u2019ll play a major role in ushering the new North American trade pact through Congress. Sabrina Rodriguez has more on Grassley\u2019s decision.\n\n\u2014 Trade war spurs ag changes in China: The escalation of tariffs between the U.S. and China has prompted Beijing to take steps to modernize its agriculture industry, which is dominated by small farms with low crop yields. The Chinese government plans to build 254 \u201cstrong agricultural industrial towns\u201d and, potentially, lift a ban on genetically modified seeds. The Wall Street Journal has the story.\n\n\u2014 Misleading studies behind chlorpyrifos approvals? New analysis of the decades-old, industry-sponsored tests of the insecticide chlorpyrifos found discrepancies between the results and what Dow Chemical Co. had reported back then to the EPA, writes Environmental Health News.\n\n\u2014 The initial tests have long been cited in continued government approvals of chlorpyrifos, which has been linked to learning disabilities in children. (The Trump administration recently appealed a federal court ruling that EPA must ban the chemical.) Here\u2019s the research.\n\n\u2014 Democrat wins Florida ag commissioner race: Nikki Fried, a South Florida attorney, defeated Republican Matt Caldwell after two rounds of recounts in the race for agriculture commissioner.

The newsletter will resume publishing on Nov. 26.\n\nWHAT THEY\u2019RE SAYING ACROSS THE POND \u2014 Your MC host co-moderated a panel in Brussels on cyber diplomacy over the weekend, and boy are the Belgians good at breakfast and churches. But, more importantly, the entire POLITICO EU conference offered some meaningful insights on subjects of interest to cyber readers everywhere.\n\n\u2014 The Paris agreement: Last week, Paris announced a broad call for improving cybersecurity, and more than 300 governments and organizations signed on to it. Some critics observed that it didn\u2019t require concrete action. Still, most of the panel thought it was a positive development. \u201cIt's the first instance actually where I think we have non-governmental actors involved in the conversation very explicitly, both private sector and civil society organizations, subscribing to certain principles,\u201d said Patryk Pawlak, Brussels executive officer for the EU Institute for Security Studies. \u201cIt's a very important shift.\u201d\n\nChristopher Painter, the former State Department cyber coordinator and currently a commissioner on the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, said the agreement \u201cwas an aggregator of a lot of things that already existed. It didn't really break new ground.\u201d But there\u2019s value in what it aggregated, as it drew on the work of Painter\u2019s commission and others. The \u201chigh-level attention\u201d is good, too, Painter said. None of the panelists took my bait on commenting on the U.S. not enlisting, but one top official suggested afterward that it was simply a matter of President Donald Trump being angry at French President Emmanuel Macron that day, given their clashes the weekend prior.\n\n\u2014 Russia attribution: Last month, a number of nations joined arms in pointing the finger at Russia for a series of cyberattacks in a rare show of widespread unity in \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d the Kremlin, although some sat out the fight. But with the exception of U.S. indictments, the resulting punishments have been minimal. That doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t in the works, the panelists said. \u201cI think it was an unprecedented view of unity,\u201d said Carmen Gonsalves, head of international cyber policy for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands. \u201cSanctions cannot be applied without a very careful process and not overnight.\u201d\n\nThe \u201creputational damage\u201d of that naming and shaming \u201ccannot be entirely discarded or underestimated,\u201d said Antonio Missiroli, assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges at NATO. Still, \u201cThe risk of escalation is there when it comes to retribution. We do have to be very careful.\u201d Painter said in this case and others, \u201cI do think it's a missed opportunity if we do the attribution and don't follow up with action very quickly.\u201d Added Painter: \u201cDeterrence means \u2018timely\u2019 and \u2018credible.\u2019\u201d Nations are getting better at this, he said, but still have a ways to go.\n\n\u2014 Election security: Europe will probably move toward certified products in the election security supply chain, said Gerhard Schabh\u00fcser, vice president for Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Information Security. Unfortunately, that might not be enough, said Uku S\u00e4rekanno, deputy director general and director of cyber security for the Information System Authority of Estonia. \u201cYou don't know about each and every tiny bit of the process where something is produced by a third party and how it's put together,\u201d said S\u00e4rekanno, who added that the supply chain was his \u201ckey concern\u201d with election security. \u201cVulnerabilities emerge even if they\u2019re certified.\u201d\n\nToo few people in the election world grasp the nature of the threat, said John Graham-Cumming, the chief technology officer for CloudFlare. \u201cThey don't grok that they are at risk as part of this overall system,\u201d he said. And Julian King, European Commissioner for the Security Union, said cybersecurity of elections is an area where nations needed to collaborate more.\n\nHAPPY MONDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

Ranking member Eliot Engel, who is expected to becoming the panel\u2019s chairman in the 116th Congress, is \u201cdisappointed \u2026 about the lack of progress the State Department made in standing up the cyber bureau,\u201d a Democratic congressional staffer told MC. Under retiring Chairman Ed Royce, the panel approved \u2014 and the House later passed \u2014 a bill, H.R. 3776, codifying an elevated cyber diplomacy office. Once Engel takes over, \u201cthe topline goal\u201d will be ensuring that \u201cthe United States has a strong leadership role in cyberspace going forward internationally,\u201d said the Democratic staffer, who added that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201clack of a plan merits significant oversight right now.\u201d\n\nThe State Department currently has a team of cyber and internet policy experts in the Economic Bureau, led by Deputy Assistant Secretary Rob Strayer. The Democratic congressional staffer said those experts were working hard but were \u201ccurrently not empowered by senior leadership within the State Department at all.\u201d The staffer also pointed to apparent \u201cconfusion and disagreement\u201d among department leaders \u201cabout what cyber diplomacy even entails,\u201d which they said was \u201cconcerning from an oversight perspective.\u201d Expect panel Democrats to continue talking to Stayer, whether at public hearings or in private briefings, the staffer said.\n\nLook for the Foreign Affairs Committee to hold country-specific hearings about the cyber threats from adversaries like Russia, China, North Korea and Iran \u2014 especially the former. \u201cThe priority \u2026 will be oversight of the decisions the administration has made,\u201d the staffer told MC, \u201cand I think at the forefront of that is oversight over the administration\u2019s interactions with Russia,\u201d with cybersecurity \u201ca key part of that.\u201d\n\nThe panel will also probe State\u2019s own cybersecurity and IT practices. Democrats are \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the agency\u2019s low Federal Information Security Management Act scores and want to ensure that State\u2019s cloud migration plans prioritize cybersecurity, according to the staffer. In addition, Democrats will scrutinize U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s offensive operations. \u201cOur committee has jurisdiction over war powers,\u201d the staffer said. The panel wants to ensure that \u201cthe checks and balances \u2026 are maintained as we look at potential\u201d cyber operations.\n\nRUSSIA\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT, CONTINUED \u2014 The State Department late last week confirmed an attempt by hackers to penetrate its networks. \"The Department is aware of the recent malicious cyber event involving the spoofing (impersonation) of a Department employee reported by U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cNo Department networks were compromised by this malicious cyber attempt.\" FireEye and CrowdStrike both said the attack looks similar to past work by APT29, the Russian government-connected hacking group also known as Cozy Bear, although both are working to solidify that attribution. Kaspersky Lab also attributed the campaign to APT29. MC first reported many of the details of the campaign.\n\nNRMC A TO Z \u2014 Senior Department of Homeland Security officials briefed reporters late last week about the status of the new National Risk Management Center and how the department is working with industry to identify the country\u2019s most important technology and processes \u2014 what it calls \u201cnational critical functions\u201d \u2014 and decide how best to protect them given their varying levels of risk. Here\u2019s some of what they said on the sidelines of a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event:\n\n\u2014 DHS doesn\u2019t have enough personnel to analyze every critical system, so the department is trying to help operators assess their own systems. The newly renamed Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will have approximately 2,000 employees, \u201cso we have to look at what those automated tools are\u201d and \u201chow can we do remote capabilities,\u201d said CISA Director Chris Krebs.\n\n\u2014 The agency has given itself until the end of the year to work with industry to identify the country\u2019s national critical functions. Beginning in early 2019, Krebs said, \u201cwe\u2019ll be prioritizing\u201d which ones to defend and how. DHS expects different interactions with different critical infrastructure sectors. \u201cThose that are more mature tend to want to work with us more,\u201d he said. \u201cCoincidentally, that maturity is also associated with the highest risk.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The NRMC\u2019s public-private partnerships will make it difficult to adhere to strict deadlines for completing tasks, because the government can\u2019t force private companies to meet their goals. \u201cThe enforceability through public-private partnerships is one of those intrinsic challenges,\u201d Krebs said. But he expressed confidence that the partnerships would succeed. \u201cThe level of participation we have in the [supply chain] task force alone shows that industry wants to do this with us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not in here to waste their time. They\u2019re not in this to waste our time.\u201d Large companies, he said, have told him that they have teams of 10 people \u201csitting here ready to go and work on this effort.\u201d\n\n\u2014 After identifying the country\u2019s national critical functions, DHS and the private sector will start discussing what level of protection each function needs. NRMC Director Robert Kolasky offered an example: Virtually every industry relies on Positioning, Navigation and Timing data, usually provided through GPS satellites. But not every industry needs the same level of precision. The financial sector measures transactions in microseconds, but other sectors may be OK measuring things in minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of, we know it\u2019s something that\u2019s important, but let\u2019s figure out to what extent,\u201d Kolasky said. \u201cBecause if I just say it\u2019s important and we should invest more, you\u2019re wasting money on risk mitigation.\u201d\n\nDMARC SUNLIGHT \u2014 The Global Cyber Alliance is releasing an interactive tool today to help consumers evaluate email domains to see if they\u2019re secure from spoofing by using the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance standard. The DMARC Leaderboard contains information on half a million domains now, and the Alliance plans to get to 10 million by the first quarter of 2019. \u201cSunlight remains the best disinfectant,\u201d said Philip Reitinger, president and CEO of GCA. \u201cThe GCA DMARC Leaderboard offers a way to compare countries, sectors and companies as to their progress in deploying email spoofing protections, and we hope it helps lead to universal adoption of DMARC.\u201d\n\nLEARNING TO FLY \u2014 Cybersecurity ranks as one of the top eight management challenges facing the Transportation Department in fiscal 2019, a newly released inspector general report concludes. Many of DOT\u2019s cybersecurity woes are old. For instance, a 2016 audit found the Security Operations Center did not have access to all departmental systems to monitor them for security incidents, and it still doesn\u2019t. If anything, it seems to be getting less secure, not more: a 2017 audit found 4,529 open security weaknesses, more than the 4,286 the IG reported a decade ago. It also has yet to implement some years-old congressional mandates on aviation cybersecurity, the IG found.\n\nDOUBLE DUTCH \u2014 The Homeland Security Department\u2019s science wing and its Dutch counterpart late last week awarded $2.5 million to five organizations to create fixes for distributed denial of service attacks and better secure industrial controls. \u201cThe capabilities developed by the joint research teams will benefit both countries today and into the future. We hope this is the first of many joint ventures with our international partners,\u201d said William Bryan, who\u2019s performing the duties of the undersecretary for science and technology.\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul wants more info on metadata before he\u2019ll let Trump's pick to be the nation's top counterterrorism official move forward. \u2026 Criminal charges have apparently been filed against WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. \u2026Huawei announced it\u2019s opening a \u201csecurity lab\u201d in Germany, amid concerns in Berlin that the company poses risks to national security.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 It\u2019s not that bad an explanation, really.\n\nQUICK BYTES\n\n\u2014 Florida Sen.

Please continue to follow POLITICO eHealth issues here.\n\nA STEP FOR THE COMMON MAN (AND WOMAN): CommonWell Health Alliance described its ability to connect any of its members to the Carequality framework Friday as a crucial step toward interoperability. And without a doubt it is encouraging. But don\u2019t take the \u201cgolden spike\u201d symbolism too far. Just a couple of years after tycoon Leland Stanford drove the ceremonial last spike linking the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads in Utah in 1869, you could take a train from coast to coast. Getting sensible data from any point in the health care system to another may take a little longer.\n\nCommonWell\u2019s vendors \u2014 Cerner, Allscripts, eClinicalWorks, Meditech, et. al. \u2014 still haven\u2019t signed up the majority of their provider clients. Once they do, of course, they\u2019ll be able to share consolidated care documents -- but even that\u2019s not enough to produce First Class service along the rails. \u2026\n\nBut there could be immediate benefit to providers and hospitals that use smaller vendors \u2014 say, Greenway Health practices, or critical access hospitals using Evident \u2014 when their patients are seen in an Epic hospital (Epic, of course, isn\u2019t part of CommonWell). \u201cThere\u2019s huge value for those type of hospitals because CommonWell wasn\u2019t giving them good access to the Epic site,\u201d says CommonWell executive director Jitin Asnaani.\n\nThe announcement \u201cis a historic event that opens the technical door for almost any provider to exchange patient records with little or no cost or effort,\u201d but \u201cwill only make a difference if everyone joins,\u201d said Coray Tate, vice president for interoperability at Klas Research. \u201cThe onus now shifts to the vendors and their customer bases to figure out how to join en masse.\u201d\n\nThe agreement should tell ONC that industry is moving toward a \u201csingle onramp\u201d to interoperability even without government actions like TEFCA, Asnaani said. \u201cMy hope is that it demonstrates to ONC they should not try to start from scratch\u201d with TEFCA. \u201cBut I also hope it puts wind in their sails.\u201d\n\nTweet of the Day: Stefan Kertesz @StefanKertesz The PDMP debate short take: (a) I use one & sometimes find it helpful, but (b) if you don't have care resources or relevant training in pain/addiction, then PDMP becomes a \"tool for getting rid of liabilities\"(i.e. people). FYI: \"getting rid of liabilities\" is _not_ health care!\n\nWelcome to Monday morning eHealth, where we\u2019re back from three days in Boston, enriched with better understanding of deep learning, Random Forest, and health IT options for the elderly.

Or pass along knowledge via Twitter @ravindranize, @arthurallen202, @dariustahir, @POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth.\n\nTELEMEDICINE USE INCREASES IN MEDICARE, BUT NOT DRAMATICALLY: The report that CMS delivered to Congress on Friday, fulfilling a duty under the 21st Century Cures Act, found an increase of telemedicine use of about 50 percent in fee-for-service Medicare from 2014 to 2016. Most of the coverage was for chronic conditions and mental health in rural areas, as before. Groups like Health IT Now and the Alliance for Connected Care are pushing for legislation that will make the service more generally available to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\u2026 CMS's analysis of claims data during the period found about 90,000 of the 35 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries used telehealth services. The report, which didn\u2019t conceal Administrator Seema Verma\u2019s bullish position on telemedicine, said that if just 1 percent of face-to-face encounters were switched to telehealth services already covered by Medicare, there would be a 13-fold increase in telehealth usage.\n\n\u2026 Reimbursement rules limiting originating sites to clinics in rural areas are the greatest barrier to wider adoption, sayeth the report.\n\nFINANCE GAVEL TO MOVE FROM ONE WRINKLED HAND TO ANOTHER: With Sen. Orrin Hatch, 84, retiring, Sen. Chuck Grassley, 85, will take over chairmanship of the Finance Committee, thereby gaining jurisdiction over a fair chunk of health care. Among other things, notes Darius Tahir, Grassley has been a longtime advocate for unique device identifiers \u2014 the FDA recently put off requiring them for Class I and unclassified devices until 2022 \u2014 and the Open Payments database, which shows the dough flowing to doctors from pharma and device companies.\n\nYELP BEATS CMS: At least when it comes to rating nursing homes, the humble crowd-sourced review site may be getting at something more important to residents and their loved ones than CMS\u2019 Nursing Home Compare, which has been around since 1998. That was the conclusion of research presented during a poster session Friday at the annual science conference of the Gerontological Society of America in Boston. The research, from the University of Southern California\u2019s school of gerontology, found a big disconnect in the ratings done by CMS and Yelp. While the Yelp results weren\u2019t statistically significant \u2014 some were based on as few as five reviews of a facility \u2014 the reviewers were consistently most interested in qualities that CMS doesn\u2019t measure, such as caring attitudes, responsiveness and cleanliness.\n\n\u2026 CMS\u2019 Nursing Home Compare \u2014 also known as the 5-Star Rating \u2014 includes measures of staff size and health inspections, but it doesn\u2019t track customer satisfaction, and there is literature suggesting that nursing homes can game some of its measures, said Heather Davila, who presented related research she and colleagues conducted at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe 5-Star Rating looks at a small set of measures based on an assessment that is a response to complaints or based on an inspection of a few days a year,\u201d she said. (This item was supported by a journalism fellowship from the GSA, the Journalists Network on Generations and the Silver Century Foundation)\n\nGOOGLE HALTING SMART LENS DIABETES PROJECT: The project, which Verily announced in 2014 in partnership with Novartis, put sensors on contact lenses to measure glucose levels for people living with diabetes. But the company has decided to put the research on hold, Chief Technology Officer Brian Otis said in a blogpost Friday evening. The Smart Lens was developed to sense and transmit data to the eye and is also useful following cataract surgery, Otis wrote, but researchers found it difficult to get reliable correlations of tear and blood glucose levels because of \u201cinterference from biomolecules in tears.\u201d That raised questions about whether the device could get FDA approval. Work on the smart contact lenses and intraocular lenses will continue, Otis said.\n\n\u2026 Verily is also working with Dexcom on miniaturized continuous glucose monitors and with Onduo, a joint venture with Sanofi that has a diabetes management platform.\n\nCMS ANNOUNCES AI CONTEST: How can AI help transform health care delivery and improve health outcomes? CMS has no idea, but will hold a competition next year to find out. More details here.\n\nBIG IT CONTRACT CHALLENGE: Cognosante and GDIT have challenged Booz Allen\u2019s $1 billion IT Operations and Services contract, which supports the VA\u2019s office of information and technology on a variety of projects. This is not to be confused with Booz Allen\u2019s $750 million change management contract with the VA for the EHR modernization project with Cerner\u2026.\n\nWHAT WE'RE CLICKING\n\nNYTimes Magazine: Will AI and other technologies transform health care and humanity?\n\nVox: Men obviously designed most of the menstrual tracking surveillance apps"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "rrainey@politico.com (Rebecca Rainey)", "title": "Shifting White House", "description": "Pressure is on pensions \u2014 Immigration policies in court", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-shift/2018/11/19/shifting-white-house-420871", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:00:48Z", "content": "With help from Ian Kullgren Editor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Shift is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Employment &amp; Immigration subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLIT\u2026 [+7436 chars]", "fulltext": "Shifting White House\n\nWith help from Ian Kullgren\n\nEditor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Shift is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Employment & Immigration subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPROGRAMMING NOTE: Morning Shift will not publish on Thursday, Nov. 22 and Friday, Nov. 23.

In an interview broadcast Sunday with Fox News' Chris Wallace, Trump said he wants Nielsen to be \"much tougher on the border \u2014 much tougher, period. We'll see what happens there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's far from an unfamiliar plight,\u201d observed POLITICO\u2019s Eliana Johnson Friday. \u201cPast officials including former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former chief of staff Reince Priebus and former national security adviser H.R.

The committee hasn\u2019t met since July. But a congressional aide assures Morning Shift that \u201cwork on a solution to the problems facing the multi-employer system is well underway.\u201d\n\nPensioners aren\u2019t buying it, and they\u2019re starting to put pressure on the president. The Protect Our Retirees Earned Retirement coalition, chaired by former Rep. Connie Mack (R.-Fla.), bought an ad on Fox News Sunday that urged President Trump to demand Congress take action. Members of the Teamsters union gathered on Capitol Hill last week to urge passage of the Butch Lewis Act, which would shore up multiemployer pensions with low-interest federal loans that could be repaid over 30 years. Watch the ad here.\n\n\u2018IT WILL GET WORSE\u2019: Josh Gotbaum, a former PBGC director, warned in a Brookings essay last week that if Congress fails to act \u201cthe situation will get worse, and a lot sooner than people think.\u201d Without a statutory fix, Gotbaum predicted there will be an \u201cemployer stampede\u201d away from all multiemployer plans--even the healthy ones.

Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) told POLITICO in an interview. The Obama Justice Department interpreted the 1964 Civil Rights Act\u2019s prohibition against sex-based workplace discrimination to bar discrimination against LGBT people, but under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions the Trump Justice Department revoked that policy. Appellate courts have split on the matter.

A new report out today from the Brookings Institution says that urban hubs such as San Francisco, Boston, and New York, accounted for \u201c72 percent of the nation\u2019s employment growth\u201d since the 2008 financial crisis. Researchers Clara Hendrickson, Mark Muro, and William Galston write that smaller metro areas (50,000 to 250,000 people) contributed less than 6 percent of the nation\u2019s employment growth since 2010. And employment \u201cremains below pre-recession levels\u201d in many rural communities (less than 50,000 people).\n\n\u201cIn a very real way, the 2016 election of Donald Trump represented the revenge of the places left behind in a changing economy,\u201d write Hendrickson, Muro, and Gallston. Policies that boost rural tech skills, access to capital, and access to broadband, among others, could tamp down the widening economic gap between rural and urban communities the report says.

House Democrats are bent on getting their hands on his returns and some want to publicly air them. While it\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s tax practices are largely a black hole to the public, some information has come out about them in dribs and drabs. Now seems like a good time to catch up on what we know.\n\nZero income taxes: Trump paid no federal income taxes in 1978 and 1979, and apparently none or next to none in 1991 and 1993, the Washington Post and POLITICO reported separately in spring 2016, based on records from New Jersey gaming regulators. He reported negative income for '78 and \u201979. Casino and hotel losses were cited for the \u201890s.\n\nThe $916 million loss: Trump claimed nearly $1 billion in net operating losses in 1995, according to three pages of returns for that year from three different states that were anonymously sent to the New York Times in late 2015. The Times said the losses were so big that they could have wiped out Trump\u2019s tax liability for the next 18 years, and our Brian Faler reported they amounted \u201cto almost 2 percent of all such deductions claimed that year.\u201d\n\nAn \u2018edgy\u2019 tactic: Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income from canceled debt in the early 1990s, the Times reported, by arguing that the income qualified for an exception that was at the time used by insolvent corporations. The maneuver was edgy but not unique, our Katy O\u2019Donnell reported.\n\nRich guy, low rate: Trump paid an effective tax rate of about 25 percent in 2005, according to two pages of returns obtained by journalist David Cay Johnston.\n\nA tangled web: Trump got at least $413 million (in today\u2019s dollars) from his father in the 1990s, mostly by using tax dodges, the Times reported in an exhaustive expose last month.\n\nPretty patchy stuff, to be sure. At each turn, the revelations were expected to do major political damage to Trump. They didn\u2019t. He rode them out, portraying them as examples of his financial savvy and playing to most Americans\u2019 inherent dislike of taxes. Would things turn out any differently if Democrats get their hands on his returns and they are publicized? It depends. If they just show that Trump did everything he could to avoid taxes, probably not, even if he used legally dubious maneuvers. Most people have already made up their minds about whether Trump is a tax dodger and whether they care. If the information shines light on conflicts of interest or shows signs of entanglement with Russia and other foreign interests? Maybe.\n\nIT'S MONDAY AND WE'RE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. We'll take leaks on Trump's taxes or what have you, at bfaler@politico.com, alorenzo@politico.com teckert@politico.com and bbecker@politico.com. You can also reach us on Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brianfaler, @aaronelorenzo,@POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.\n\nIN CONGRESS\n\nGRASSLEY\u2019S BACK: Now that Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has decided to claim the gavel at Senate Finance, what can we expect? More oversight, for one thing. \u201cWhatever committee I\u2019ve been on, I spend more time on oversight than I do on legislating. And I intend to keep that up,\u201d Grassley recently told Tax Notes. \u201cI only need one vote to do oversight \u2014 my own vote.\u201d In the past, Grassley has scrutinized overseas tax shelters, the treatment of whistleblowers who report tax fraud, and tax-exempt organizations. \"He'll look very broadly,\" Dean Zerbe, a former top tax aide to Grassley, told our Aaron Lorenzo.\n\nIf Grassley does do some legislating, it might include two provisions that he was unable to get into the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115), that would clarify which rewards whistleblowers are entitled to and end double taxation of rewards. Various interests are also clamoring for corrections to the TCJA.\n\nGrassley\u2019s intended focus on oversight recognizes the difficulty of getting any major tax legislation through the next Congress given the split partisan control of the chambers. However, Grassley was known for working with Democrats on some key issues during previous stints as Finance chairman. \u201cI appreciate his willingness to work across the aisle, and I know that his voice will be an important one in the 116th Congress,\u201d said Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who is expected to be Ways and Means chairman. \u201cI hope that the Senator and I will be able to work together to expand opportunity for American families.\"\n\nIn other Finance news, committee member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) conceded that he\u2019s lost his bid for re-election, becoming the panel\u2019s third casualty of the midterms. Two of his colleagues, Sens. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.), also lost their seats.\n\nDEMS SPLIT ON TAX RULE: House Democrats are squabbling over a provision in a draft of chamber rules for the next Congress that would require a three-fifths \u201csupermajority\u201d vote to raise income taxes on the lowest-earning 80 percent of taxpayers. (It would only take a simple majority to raise taxes on the highest-earning 20 percent.) Under Republican rules in force now, it takes a supermajority for any income tax increase. The Democratic proposal has the support of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Neal, but not everyone in the caucus likes the idea.\n\n\u201cSome liberal Democrats said that if the party limits its own ability to raise taxes, it could make it harder for the House to adopt policies that could require tax increases, including a Medicare-for-all health program or a plan for tuition-free state colleges and universities,\u201d the Washington Post reported. Some House Democratic aides noted that the requirement could be waived on a case-by-case basis by the Rules Committee.\n\nAMAZON EFFECT: Two groups that oppose tax extenders legislation that Congress may take up in the coming weeks are using the massive subsidies given to Amazon by New York and Virginia to build their case. \u201cAmericans across the country, including lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, have rightfully decried the billions of dollars in corporate welfare given to Amazon,\u201d Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners say in a letter they intend to send today to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cLegislation like this rigs the system for the powerful and connected few at the expense of everyone else, and undermines what little trust Americans have in our political institutions and elected officials.\u201d\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nBRING YOUR BRAIN TO MAINE: Some boosters of Opportunity Maine, a program that provides a tax credit to help residents pay off their student loans if they attend a state university, want to expand it to people who move to the state with college debt. They see it \u201cas a key part of a strategy to bring more young people to to the state and keep them here,\u201d the Bangor Daily News reported. Nate Wildes, the engagement director for the group that markets Opportunity Maine, \u201cviews the credit as a crucial tool to address the state\u2019s aging workforce, as well as recent projections of stagnant job growth over the next eight years.\u201d But some lawmakers are loath to tinker with the program, saying it\u2019s complicated enough already.\n\nHEADING TO COURT: A judge in Washington state ruled that plaintiffs can move forward with a suit that alleges the Seattle City Council violated the state\u2019s open meeting law before its vote to repeal a \u201chead tax\u201d on large corporations. \u201cThree lawyers sued the city alleging the council majority and Mayor Jenny Durkan violated state open meetings law by reaching an agreement before the vote,\u201d the Associated Press reported.\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nTAX PROTESTS IN FRANCE: At least 409 people were injured over the weekend in protests in France over tax increases on diesel fuel and gasoline. \u201cGrassroots protesters, dubbing themselves \u2018yellow jackets\u2019 for the safety jackets French motorists are required to keep in vehicles for emergencies, paralyzed traffic by blocking roads around the country Saturday,\u201d the Associated Press reported. \u201cBlockades were counted at 150 scattered locations Sunday, [Interior Minister Christophe] Castaner told RTL radio.\u201d\n\nMEANWHILE, IN GERMANY: Economy Minister Peter Altmaier called for tax cuts to boost economic growth after the German economy experienced its first contraction in three years. \u201cAltmaier, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s governing conservatives, said he was focused on cutting high German corporate taxes following tax cuts in the United States, Britain and soon France,\u201d Reuters reported, citing an interview that Altmaier gave the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nYahoo Finance takes a look at who might be paying more under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nGeorgia Senate gives final approval to bill yanking Delta\u2019s tax break for snubbing the NRA.\n\nHow stock market turmoil might help your tax bill.\n\nPot tax receipts surging in Oregon.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nFifteen states require supermajorities to raise taxes."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "ABehsudi@politico.com (Adam Behsudi)", "title": "A new front in the China trade war", "description": "APEC meeting ends without joint statement \u2014 USMCA\u2019s tough road ahead", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2018/11/19/a-new-front-in-the-china-trade-war-420911", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:00:42Z", "content": "With help from Doug Palmer PROGRAMMING NOTE: Morning Trade will not publish on Thursday, Nov. 22 and Friday, Nov. 23.

The U.S. and China clash over a final statement at this past weekend\u2019s APEC summit, a bad sign for talks at the G-20. Trump faces a tough road ahead for his new NAFTA deal as lawmakers on the left and right start picking apart the final pact. Start here:\n\nA NEW FRONT IN THE CHINA TRADE WAR: The Trump administration will make its next big move towards China by opening a comment process today for a major new rule that would restrict exports of emerging and critical technology.\n\nThe rule will open a new front against Beijing as part of legislation increase scrutiny of transactions by U.S. companies with foreign firms and to limit exports of key U.S. \u201cdual-use\u201d technologies -- ones that have both commercial and military applications.\n\nWhat could result: The rule will implement portions of the Export Control Reform Act, which was passed Congress in August as part of a broader defense bill that included a major overhaul of U.S. investment screening procedures. The legislation allows the Trump administration to cite national security to control exports of goods or technology that may not necessarily have a military use but could have economic or competitive advantages.\n\nThe executive branch usually has the authority to define a national security risk, but previous administrations have generally kept export controls narrowly focused on preventing adversarial countries from gaining a military advantage.\n\nKey sectors: The areas identified as essential to the national security of the U.S. have a lot of overlap with technology that China is aiming to boost through its Made in China 2025 initiative and other programs. The 14 categories include biotechnology; artificial intelligence; microprocessor technology; robotics; advanced materials, among others. It also leaves open the possibility of other categories of technology being added.\n\nSped-up timeline: The effort will provide only 30 days for what one former senior Commerce Department official calls the start of one \u201cthe most complex, intellectually challenging, and economically significant effort to identify simultaneously multiple disparate categories of undefined emerging technologies for non-specific national security concerns.\u201d Most routine notice and comment processes provide at least a 60-day window for public input.\n\n\u201cThis period is not only over the holiday season, but also in the heart of the fourth quarter when company engineers, researchers, sales staff, management, and other professionals are focused on completing annual sales, shipment, and other goals,\u201d said Kevin Wolf, who served as assistant secretary of Commerce for export administration under the Obama administration.\n\nIT'S MONDAY, NOV. 19!

The main sticking point was whether the statement should include a reference to WTO changes, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill of said during a closing press conference.\n\nThe U.S. wanted a tough statement demanding China no longer be treated as a developing nation under WTO rules, the Australian Financial Review reported. The world\u2019s two largest economies also could not agree on language involving state-owned enterprises, which the United States believes have an unfair advantage over private firms because of the support they receive from China and other governments, the publication said.\n\nThe failure bodes badly for another leaders meeting, the G-20, on Nov. 30-Dec. 1, which both President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to attend.\n\nPENCE: TARIFFS WILL STAY UNTIL CHINA CHANGES BEHAVIOR: In a speech at the APEC CEO Summit, Vice President Mike Pence underscored the Trump administration\u2019s determination to keep up the pressure on China.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods and we could more than double that number. But we hope for better. The United States though will not change course until China changes its ways,\u201d Pence said.\n\nU.S. vs. them: He also criticized China\u2019s Belt-and-Road regional infrastructure initiative as a ploy to bind other countries to Beijing. \u201cKnow that the United States offers a better option. We don\u2019t drown our partners in a sea of debt. We don\u2019t coerce or compromise your independence. The United States deals openly, fairly. We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road.\u201d Pence said.\n\nThe vice president, who met with a number of regional leaders during his trip abroad, also touted efforts to start trade talks with Japan. He hinted at negotiations with another APEC member, although he did not provide the name of the country. USTR has previously identified the Philippines as a candidate, despite concerns that many Democrats have about Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s human rights record.\n\nXI: BELT-AND-ROAD NOT \u2018A TRAP\u2019: In his remarks to the same group, Xi rejected U.S. criticism of the five-year-old Belt-and-Road initiative.\n\n\u201cIt is not designed to serve any hidden geopolitical agenda, it is not targeted against anyone and it does not exclude anyone. It is not an exclusive club that is closed to non-members, nor is it a \u2018trap\u2019 as some people have labeled it,\u201d Xi said.\n\nHe also defended the rules-based world trading system developed by the U.S. and other Western powers in the decades after World War II, but called for changes to give developing countries a greater say. \u201cRules should be formulated by the international community, not in a might-is-right way. Once the rules are made, they should not be followed or bent as one sees fit, and they should not be applied with double standards for selfish agendas,\u201d Xi said.\n\nUSMCA\u2019S TOUGH ROAD AHEAD: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are raising concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s new deal to overhaul NAFTA. On the left, members are expressing doubts on whether the pact\u2019s labor and environment rules are tough enough. On the right, House members have raised alarm over new protections for LGBT workers.\n\nIf he\u2019s blocked in Congress, Trump will be facing a major setback on an issue where he\u2019s already been claiming credit for delivering on a campaign promise. He would be left with the unattractive choices of leaving the North American Free Trade Agreement in place, heading back to the negotiating table or pulling out of the deal entirely, as he\u2019s repeatedly threatened.\n\n\"I warned the administration that they could find themselves in this trap of having some agreement and coming back to Congress as an afterthought expecting ratification,\" Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.) told POLITICO. \"That's not how this place works.\" Pro Trade\u2019s Sabrina Rodriguez has the full story here.\n\nCHAMBER STILL ON THE USMCA FENCE: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has yet to endorse the USMCA, nearly 50 days after the final part of the deal with Canada was struck. It outlined what it likes \u2014 and doesn\u2019t like \u2014 about the agreement in a filing ahead of last week\u2019s International Trade Commission hearing on the economic impact of pact.\n\nOn the plus side: The \u201cagreement includes strong, positive provisions in a number of chapters, some of which surpass the quality achieved in any earlier U.S. trade agreement,\u201d the Chamber said. Those include the chapters on digital trade, intellectual property, financial services, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, competition policy, and state-owned enterprises.\n\n\u201cNAFTA\u2019s positive status quo\u201d was also maintained in many areas, the Chamber said.\n\nSpecifically, it remains trilateral, tariffs removed in the original agreement weren\u2019t reimposed, and two key dispute settlement chapters weren\u2019t eliminated as the Trump administration had originally proposed \u2014 although it would have been better if those chapters were reformed to make the dispute settlement function of the agreement work better, the Chamber said.\n\nWhat it doesn\u2019t favor: The group cited weakening of investment protections, the more restrictive auto rules of origin, the termination of government procurement coverage with Canada and the reduction of the same coverage with Mexico as disappointing.\n\nIt also said it wasn\u2019t happy about the small increase in the \u201cde minimis\u201d level agreed by Canada and Mexico, which means many packages entering those two countries from the United States will still face significant border taxes.\n\nThe Chamber also called for an immediate lifting of tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico\u2014and those countries\u2019 retaliation against more than $15 billion of U.S. exports.\n\nCHAMBER TAKES ANTI-TARIFF MESSAGE TO THE AIRWAVES: To drive home its point, the Chamber is running ads on Washington radio stations through the end of the month (with a brief break over Thanksgiving) urging the administration to lift the tariffs.\n\nThat effort coincides with advertising the business group is doing on social media, which warn that approximately $500 million of America\u2019s imports and exports are hit each week by Trump\u2019s tariffs and Canada and Mexico\u2019s retaliatory duties, \u201craising costs for U.S. manufacturers and consumers, hurting American exporters, and putting American jobs at risk.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t mess with Texas: Several Texas energy associations have urged the administration not to replace the steel and aluminum duties with a hard quota on imports because of the harm that would have on the state\u2019s energy production.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned such an action would create an artificial impediment to new oil and natural gas development activity in the Permian Basin in Texas as well as other regions throughout the country and impede the President\u2019s \u2018Energy Dominance\u2019 agenda,\u201d the groups said in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \u201cHard quotas would stop the delivery of steel that is needed for Texas oil and natural gas development.\u201d\n\nThe letter was signed by the Texas Oil and Gas Association, the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association, Permian Basin Petroleum Association, Texas Association of Manufacturers, Texas Association of Business, and the Association of Energy Service Companies.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 In an unusual move, China\u2019s former chief trade negotiator criticized Beijing\u2019s decision to target U.S. soybeans as ill-thought out, the South China Morning Post reports.\n\n\u2014 The trade war is forcing China to spur efforts to modernize its farming sector, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\n\u2014 In an interview with POLITICO Pro, Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the U.S. is bringing its \u2018A-game\u2019 in efforts to export more U.S. energy products to Eastern Europe. More here.\n\n\u2014 Washington trade advocacy groups have resorted to checking if large blocks of hotel rooms are unavailable for any signs of U.S.-China trade talks, CNN reports.\n\n\u2014 As part of a news series, The New York Times examines several aspects of how China came to dominate economically, including in its approaches to the internet and in financing various projects.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

In the televised interview on C-SPAN's \"Newsmakers,\" DeFazio indicated he doesn\u2019t plan to smooth out his rough edges as chairman, calling Larry Summers a \u201cjerk\u201d and referring to \u201csome idiot\u201d at DOT. But he stood by his promise to work with President Donald Trump on infrastructure.\n\nClimate kerfuffle: DeFazio has been one of several Democratic committee leaders pushing back on the idea that the new majority should create a standalone climate panel, and questioning the aggressive tactics of some newly elected Democrats. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an issue he wants to tackle next year, as it relates to transportation policy. He told MT on Friday: \u201cWhen you look at how much carbon pollution there is due to congestion, wasted fuel, people sitting in traffic. It\u2019s a major component of what we want to do in having more efficient movement of people and goods and more transit options for people.\u201d DeFazio said while the issue is not his primary focus or jurisdiction, \u201cwe will be addressing components of contributions to climate change.\u201d\n\nIT\u2019S MONDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

Rick Scott Sunday, ending a bitter election which came down to a hand recount. The latest vote tallies had the Democrat down just 10,000 votes. Nelson's defeat could set off a scramble among Democrats, as it opens up their top spot on Commerce. There have been suggestions that current Energy Committee ranking member Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who would be first in line for the Commerce position, might make the switch. If she doesn't, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has the next shot.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nVICTORY LAP: A Friday morning meeting co-hosted by DeFazio and fellow infrastructure-happy Oregon Democrat Earl Blumenauer, billed as a \u201cpost-election wrap / new congress infrastructure agenda setting\u201d gathering, generated \u201clots of enthusiasm and energy\u201d from the standing-room-only crowd, according to one person who was present at the meeting. The lawmakers said they planned to hold hearings to gather ideas and recommendations to solve the country\u2019s greatest infrastructure needs. Blumenauer, who serves on Ways and Means and is plotting to establish an infrastructure subcommittee, noted that the Republicans on that committee held only one hearing on transportation funding and finance in the eight years they were in charge.\n\n** A message from PlanetM \u2013 Michigan, where big ideas in mobility are born: When it comes to mobility, safety is no accident in Michigan.

The company, Build Your Dreams, is the only bus company that would be covered by the ban, which is the result of \u201ca lobbying effort to protect the domestic freight rail industry from Chinese incursions,\u201d Shaun Courtney writes.

But one new element is already emerging as a major problem for many: A requirement added to the final version of the proposal that colleges hold a so-called \u201clive hearing\u201d \u2014 including cross-examination \u2014 during disciplinary proceedings.\n\n\u2014 The new rule seems to be creating something of an alliance between advocates for sexual assault survivors, who say cross-examination can be retraumatizing for victims, and college officials, who say the rule is far too prescriptive and will force schools to mimic criminal trials in a way they aren\u2019t prepared to do.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThis would apparently permit one student to hire a highly paid legal pit bull to grill another student in a campus disciplinary proceeding,\u201d said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, the leading higher education lobby group. \u201cWe will have serious concerns about such a provision \u2026 To the extent that they\u2019re trying to turn a campus disciplinary proceeding into a courtroom, we are deeply troubled, because we aren\u2019t courts.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The University of California \u2014 among the largest university systems in the nation \u2014 blasted the proposal, in large part because of the new live hearing requirement. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently intimidating,\u201d Suzanne Taylor, the UC system\u2019s Title IX coordinator, told Morning Education. \u201cThis change more than almost any other will discourage complainants from coming forward.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Education Department has stressed that the cross-examination in the hearings should be conducted by advisers or attorneys for the students, and not the students themselves. The students could also request to be in separate rooms during the hearing.\n\n\u2014 That \u201calleviates the articulated concern of the trauma when someone is cross-examined directly by the person they believe sexually assaulted them, while still protecting those fundamental principles of fairness that go by the wayside when cross-examination is set aside,\u201d said Joe Cohn, legislative and policy director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties group that pushed to add the live hearing. \u201cCross-examination is the single most important engine toward the discovery of truth.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The proposal would ban the alternative used by some schools in which a single investigator probes allegations and makes a decision. That model is despised by groups like FIRE that say schools have trampled due process for the accused.\n\n\u2014 The live hearing is likely one of the few elements of the new rules that schools will oppose. Schools could use a higher standard of evidence for discipline decisions related to sexual misconduct and offer mediation if both students agree to it, under the proposal. The rules also would significantly raise the bar for when schools are required to launch investigations. \u201cThe bigger picture is that there can be, I think, little doubt that these regulations, taken as a whole, will result in fewer sexual assault investigations at institutions,\u201d Josh Richards, a higher education attorney, told Morning Education.\n\nWELCOME TO THE WORKING WEEK.

And follow us on Twitter: @Morning_Edu and @POLITICOPro.\n\nON THE HILL\n\nDEMOCRATS VOW TO FIGHT DEVOS\u2019 PROPOSAL: Democrats say they will use their newfound control of the House to derail the proposed Title IX regulation. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader and potential House speaker, promised \u201cbold, immediate action\u201d in a statement: \u201cOur Democratic Majority, led by strong, diverse and dynamic women, will fight this cruel agenda.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Other Democrats promising to push back included Rep. Rosa DeLauro, (D-Conn.), in line to become the next chairwoman of the subcommittee that writes the Education Department budget, and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), expected to become the next chairwoman of Financial Services.\n\n\u2014 Ayanna Pressley, a newly elected Massachusetts Democrat, tweeted at DeVos that she is a campus sexual assault survivor and knows the \"pain and fear survivors feel when they disclose\": \"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Ayanna Pressley. I\u2019ve just arrived in DC. I\u2019m here to fight for survivors and hold your @usedgov accountable.\" More on that here.\n\nTITLE IX\n\nWHAT THE PROPOSAL COULD MEAN FOR K12 SCHOOLS: The Title IX proposed rules are largely associated with campus sexual assault, but Title IX has jurisdiction over K-12 schools, too. K-12 schools have dealt with both peer-on-peer sexual abuse and instances in which students are targeted by adults, such as teachers or coaches.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe implicit message from ED is that \u2018we\u2019re taking this whole sexual assault thing way too far,\u2019 and we\u2019re concerned the proposed guidance will both deter victims from coming forward and slow the momentum on education and prevention that school leaders have begun to build,\u201d said Bob Farrace, a spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School Principals, in a statement.\n\n\u2014 Under the proposal, K-12 schools would be allowed to have live hearings like those on college campuses, but it wouldn\u2019t be a requirement. Lara Kaufmann, director of public policy at Girls Inc., said it appears unlikely schools would conduct such hearings, but it remains a possibility. \u201cThis is a particularly concerning part of the proposed regulations; it is easy to imagine how scary this could be for a young student,\u201d Kaufmann said in a statement.\n\n\u2014 Also, under the proposal, it appears if a teacher witnessed peer-on-peer sexual harassment or was told of it by one of the students involved, the school would be required to act. Catherine Lhamon, a civil right lawyer who oversaw the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights under President Barack Obama, questioned why it doesn\u2019t include others in a school setting that students trust, such as a teacher\u2019s aide or counselor. \u201cWhen students have reported to a non-teacher, under this proposed regulation, the school would not have an obligation to act, and that will leave our children dramatically unsafe,\u201d she said.\n\nHIGHER EDUCATION\n\nBLOOMBERG\u2019S BIG GIFT: Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2014 who is weighing a 2020 presidential bid \u2014 plans to give $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins University for undergraduate student financial aid. The gift to the private, Baltimore-based research institution allows it to permanently commit to providing \u201cneed-blind\u201d admissions that weigh just merit in decisions \u2014 without considering a prospective student's finances. Bloomberg is a 1964 graduate of Johns Hopkins.\n\n\u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s gift represents the largest-ever donation to a U.S. college or university, according to the university and Bloomberg Philanthropies in a joint press release announcing the gift. A list of the largest university donations since 1967 published by the Chronicle of Higher Education appears to support that claim. Kimberly Hefling has more.\n\nTHURMOND WINS CALIFORNIA SUPERINTENDENT RACE: Tony Thurmond, a Democratic state legislator and former social worker backed by teachers unions, won the super close \u2014 and extremely costly \u2014 race to be California\u2019s next education chief. Thurmond tweeted over the weekend that Marshall Tuck, the former president of a charter school organization, had called to congratulate him on winning the race. \u201cI intend to be a champion of public schools & a Superintendent for all CA students,\u201d Thurmond tweeted. The San Francisco Chronicle has more.\n\nA CHALLENGE TO CHARTER SCHOOL FUNDING IN MISSISSIPPI: The nonprofit National Alliance for Public Charter Schools has filed a brief in a Mississippi lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of state and local funding for charter schools there.\n\n\u2014 Mississippi has just a handful of charter schools after passing a law in 2013 that allows for their creation. The case challenging how they\u2019re funded was first filed in July 2016 by a group of public school parents, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center. A Mississippi chancery court earlier this year upheld the constitutionality of how charter schools are funded in the state and the parents appealed to the state Supreme Court.

With the Cisneros result official, it\u2019s hard to imagine how the 2018 election could have gone worse for California Republicans \u2014 and as Carla gleans from a SoCal gathering of GOP politicos, the calls to start anew are getting louder:\n\n-- RIP CAGOP: \u201cIn the wake of a near-political annihilation in California that has left even longtime conservative stronghold Orange County bereft of a single Republican in the House of Representatives, a growing chorus of GOP loyalists here say there\u2019s only one hope for reviving the flatlining party: Blow it up and start again from scratch.\n\n-- That harsh assessment comes as Republicans survey the damage from the devastation of a \u2018blue tsunami\u2019 in California which wiped out [six] GOP-held House seats ... while handing every statewide seat and a supermajority to the Democrats in both houses of the state legislature this week.\n\n-- \u2018I believe that the party has to die before it can be rebuilt. And by die \u2014 I mean, completely decimated. And I think Tuesday night was a big step,\u2019 says veteran California GOP political consultant Mike Madrid. \u2018There is no message. There is no messenger. There is no money. And there is no infrastructure.\u2019\u201d Read Carla Marinucci\u2019s story in POLITICO here.\n\nINSURANCE COMMISSIONER: Democratic state Sen. Ricardo Lara officially defeated party-less Steve Poizner, handing a victory to labor groups who backed Lara and throwing into question the emergent strategy of independent candidates like Poizner filling the void of successful statewide Republicans. Traditional GOP allies like the California Chamber of Commerce and the realtors backed Poizner, a former Republican, but he came up some 400,000 votes short.\n\nSTATE SUPE: State Assemblyman Tony Thurmond declared victory over Marshall Tuck, who called to concede; while the AP hasn't called this one yet, Thurmond leads by some 150,000 votes.\n\n-- While this one is technically nonpartisan, the result is a big win for elected Democrats, allies like the California Teachers Association and the California Democratic Party, which heavily backed Thurmond. As the Sac Bee's Sophia Bollag writes, the result cements a second big loss for charter school advocates despite spending millions this cycle: Story\n\nAD-16: It\u2019s official: come December, the Bay Area won\u2019t have a single Bay Area Republican after Assemblywoman Catharine Baker conceded to Democratic challenger Rebecca Bauer-Kahan on Friday.

Yes. We\u2019ll let science determine this over a longer period of time,\u201d on whether climate change is a factor.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss it.\u201d (To which Jerry replied: \u201cobliquely.\u201d). \u201cWe have different views but maybe not as different as people think,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cThings are happening.

If last night\u2019s poker game is any indication, I\u2019m going to have a break-even week.\n\nTHE BUZZ\n\nSusana Mendoza\u2019s camp has polling that shows she and Toni Preckwinkle are frontrunners in the crowded contest for mayor. The poll comes days after Mendoza officially joined the race and just as mayoral candidates deliver their petitions to run.\n\nThe poll was conducted by Global Strategy Group, the same Democratic shop that surveyed for J.B. Pritzker. The phone interview poll was conducted Nov. 8-11 among 600 likely Chicago voters; margin of error is +/-4.0%. Some key findings from the memo:\n\nBefore presenting positive bios or a simulated campaign, respondents said they favored Preckwinkle 15% to Mendoza\u2019s 13%. Rounding out were businessmen Bill Daley (9%) and Willie Wilson (8%), former police Chief Garry McCarthy (7%) and former CPS CEO Paul Vallas (6%).\n\nAfter hearing positive information about Mendoza, Preckwinkle and Daley, Mendoza moves up in the simulated campaign, receiving 24% support (from 13% before the bio was presented), while Preckwinkle moves up 4 points to 19%; Daley went up to 16%. Other candidates received single digit support.\n\nName recognition/favorability: The poll says three-quarters of Chicago voters (73%) are familiar with Preckwinkle, making her the best-known candidate in the race. As for her faves, 43% of voters have a favorable view of the Cook County Board president, 31% unfavorable. That adds up to a +12 net favorability rating. In that same category, Mendoza, currently state comptroller, appears as the most-liked candidate, polling at 49% favorable and 14% unfavorable. She has 63% familiarity with voters, which all adds to a +35 net favorability rating.\n\nIn a run-off scenario, Mendoza bests Preckwinkle, 39% to 33%. The polling memo asserts she\u2019s \u201cespecially strong among voters under 45\u201d with Mendoza getting 47% compared with Preckwinkle\u2019s 25%. The memo says voters also would choose Mendoza over Daley in a head-to-head, 47% to 29%.\n\nMORE BUZZ\n\nLet the games begin! Today\u2019s the day city candidates start turning in signed petitions to get on February\u2019s ballot. Candidates generally turn in double or triple what\u2019s necessary, knowing that signatures might be challenged. Toni Preckwinkle will filling 60,000 signatures\u2014or five times the necessary 12,500.\n\nThere\u2019s a cottage industry of experts who notarize petitions or challenge competitors. But this game still requires some strategy: There are candidates who wait until closer to the Nov. 26 deadline to turn in signatures, thus shortening the window for anyone to challenge. Susana Mendoza won\u2019t turn in petitions today, though her team says it\u2019s collected plenty and is now in the process of validating signatures.\n\nLook for Jerry Joyce to be among the first in line to turn in the petitions and get a lottery number to pick where he\u2019ll be on the ballot. Joyce, an attorney, is the stealth mayoral candidate who says he has three times the signatures needed.\n\nA lifelong Chicagoan with an accent to prove it, Joyce counts former Mayor Richard M. Daley as a family friend. He told POLITICO he was compelled to run because he wants to right the city ship. Joyce says he brings \u201cnew perspective and new energy to the race and to City Hall.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll roll out his plans in the coming weeks. Two things to expect: He wants to increase the number of police detectives. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that criminals who may be repeat offenders may continue to walk the street.\u201d And he has a plan for finances that doesn\u2019t include \u201cpiling on fines and fees.\u201d\n\nAldermanic candidates will be filing starting today, too: Leslie Fox, who\u2019s running in the 43rd Ward, needs 473 signatures but will be turning in 4,000. And Michael Negron of the 47th Ward, will be turning in 4,200.\n\nNext big day: Dec. 5.

Pritzker visiting Rahm Emanuel the other day. Turns out the governor-elect sat down with the mayor for his Chicago Stories podcast. Some bits from the Q&A:\n\nPritzker plans to pitch Illinois just as a marketer might promote a business. Emanuel responded, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a concept we haven\u2019t tried in a while.\u201d (Maybe a subtle dig at the current governor.)\n\nRegarding the Dems\u2019 supermajority in the statehouse, Pritzker said, there are \u201cnever too many Democrats.\u201d That prompted Emanuel to respond with a warning that there\u2019s a \u201chubris\u201d with a supermajority that has you thinking \u201cyou can just do anything and you don\u2019t make real fundamental choices.\u201d\n\nAnd on the lighter side: Pritzker and Emanuel had a good laugh sharing how they both met their wives on a blind date and for some reason they both scored second dates, too.\n\n\u2014 Chicago billionaire Ken Griffin supports Republicans, but he\u2019s no ideologue.

Yet, legislation that lawmakers are considering, SB 2641, would deny Illinoisans from an opportunity to make money while their cars sit idle and unfairly double tax car owners. Car sharing is not the same as car rental, and the two industries cannot be treated the same. With car sharing, car owners can benefit financially while they aren\u2019t using their cars. When regular Illinoisans buy a car, they pay sales tax. Rental car companies don\u2019t because they have a sales tax waiver. But, this bill would force a car owner who has already paid sales tax to pay twice if they want to earn extra money sharing their car. Legislators should VOTE NO on the SB 2641 override. www.ILCarSharing.com\n\nFollow us on Twitter Shia Kapos @shiakapos"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "nmccaskill@politico.com (Nolan D.

And no one has stepped forward to challenge Pelosi, although Rep.

She has enlisted powerful allies to weigh in on her behalf and worked to build an air of inevitability around her bid,\u201d she continues. \u201cStill, while so far it is a threat without a face, the rebellious Democrats are eyeing the most consequential challenge yet to Ms. Pelosi\u2019s tenure as their leader.\u201d Pelosi is expected to easily win a majority vote for the speaker nomination next week, but the opposition is threatening to block her from reaching 218 votes in a Jan. 3 floor vote.

Justice Democrats said it will prioritize women and diversity in its recruitment.\u201d\n\nThe group wants congressional Democrats to be representative of their diverse communities and back liberal policies such as Medicare for all, abolishing ICE and rejecting corporate PAC donations. Justice Democrats expects to focus on seats in reliably blue districts. \u201cReplacing safe Democratic incumbents with more progressives and diverse leaders, the thinking goes, could move the Overton window of what is and is not acceptable in the Democratic Party,\u201d Thompson writes. \u201cStill, it is unusual for freshmen Democrats to throw their support behind an organization that is threatening to wage primaries against their new colleagues.

Seth Moulton for his anti-Nancy Pelosi quest was inevitable on Capitol Hill. But he's also under fire at home, too. A group of several dozen progressives plan to protest the congressman's town hall in Amesbury tonight, and some prominent Democrats are already calling for a primary challenge against him in 2020.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHow real is the threat? Hard to say this far in advance \u2014 after all, the 2018 elections just ended. Since winning the seat in 2014, he\u2019s not had a primary challenge.\n\n\"I think somebody primarying him would need more than just the issue of the vote on Pelosi. That's not enough to generate support,\" political adviser Doug Rubin told me. He doesn't think anyone's mounting a primary challenge against Moulton at the moment, but said a fit for the seat down the line could be Salem Mayor Kim Driscoll.\n\nBut as protest organizer Isa Leshko sees it, there\u2019s another issue \u2014 whether Moulton runs for his House seat in 2020 at all. She said she considered raising money for a challenger this week, but that wouldn't be much use if Moulton runs for Sen. Ed Markey's seat or proves the rumor mill right on a presidential run. For his part, Moulton has said his sights are on changing leadership in the House, not higher office.\n\n\"The challenge with Seth is it's fairly clear that he has higher political aspirations beyond representative,\" Leshko said. \"So it's not clear if we were to go the Crowdpac route how that would work if he ends up not running again for representative but instead pursuing a different seat.\" (Crowdpac is a website that helps Democratic and independent outsider candidates raise money and run for office.)\n\nBecause many voters in Moulton's district are registered as independent, it could be hard for someone to run to his left \u2014 independent voters in Massachusetts can choose to vote in whichever primary election they choose. \"A progressive candidate might not be able to take his place,\" protest organizer Bambi Snodgrass said on Sunday.\n\nMoulton's position on Pelosi isn\u2019t exactly new. He\u2019s been vocal about it since the 2016 election, and it hasn\u2019t caused him problems at home yet. This year, he was uncontested in the primary and won with more than 65 percent of the vote in the general . Bucking the party establishment is part of his brand \u2014 he took down veteran Democratic incumbent Rep. John Tierney in 2014 to capture the seat in the first place. \"If he really believes that's the right thing then I respect him for it. I don't agree with it, but I respect elected officials who stand up for what they believe in if that's what he's doing,\" Rubin said of Moulton's push against Pelosi.\n\nAs for the constituents who don't agree with Moulton's crusade, they plan to spread themselves in the crowd at his town hall tonight and ask him to pledge support for Pelosi.\n\n\"We're coming out there to let Seth know that we are outraged at his opposition to Nancy Pelosi for Speaker. She's obviously the most qualified person and the optics of having five white guys trying to oust another woman in power is just unacceptable,\" Snodgrass said, referring to some of the male Democratic congressman who are also publicly opposed to Pelosi as speaker.\n\nMoulton's office says he welcomes the opposition, and that challenging the status quo always comes with resistance.\n\n\"Seth is looking forward to it, and as he always says, he\u2019s hoping it\u2019s not just a room full of people who agree with him,\" Moulton spokesman Matt Corridoni told me in an email.\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

In a move that simultaneously targets Gov.

Phil Murphy, state Democratic Chairman John Currie and Republicans, legislative Democrats next month plan a vote on a controversial amendment that would overhaul state legislative redistricting.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFour sources, two from the Legislature, tell me that the vote on the amendment is planned for December 17. None of the sources would go on the record.\n\nDemocrats tried to pass the amendment (ACR60) three years ago, but it stalled. They\u2019re more confident they can do it this time. The timing is key, as I\u2019ll explain below.\n\nThe amendment would change several things, but two of the provisions are especially big and controversial. First, it would change who appoints the 12-member redistricting commission. Under the current system, the state Democratic and Republican chairman each get six picks. The state Supreme Court justice picks the tiebreaker when they inevitably deadlock. The amendment would reduce the number of picks each party chair gets to two, and give two picks each to the Senate president, speaker and the two minority leaders. Naturally, this would mean Democratic State Chairman John Currie, who is allied with Murphy, would have much less juice in redistricting as Sweeney and Coughlin get their own people in. We all know Murphy and the legislative leaders don\u2019t have a good working relationship, so you can see the logic behind the attempt.\n\nThe second big thing the amendment would do is put Republicans at a big disadvantage by incorporating a formula into the state constitution that\u2019s based on the Donald Stokes \u201cfairness test.\u201d Essentially, it would require the district maps to reflect a political party \u201cperformance index\u201d in the statewide vote. So under the amendment, at least 10 of the 40 state legislative districts could have to be \u201ccompetitive.\u201d But the baseline for what constitutes a competitive district would be based how each political party performed in the previous decade of elections for president, U.S. Senate and governor. Considering New Jersey has over 900,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans and hasn\u2019t elected a Republican senator since 1972, you can see why this wouldn\u2019t do Republicans any favors. And when you consider that Republicans\u2019 best shots at picking up state legislative seats over the next decade are in South Jersey, you can see why Democratic lawmakers from that region have been particularly aggressive about this.\n\nOf course, it will be up to voters to approve the amendment. And legislative Democrats would have two ways to get it on the ballot by the 2019 election. They could pass it once it just once in both houses by a three-fifths majority, which is unlikely; Republicans and Murphy allies are unlikely to vote for it. Or they can pass it with a simple majority in two consecutive calendar years. So if they pass it in December with a simple majority, they can pass it again in January to get it on the ballot in November 2019.\n\nWHERE\u2019S MURPHY? \u201cAsk the Governor\u201d on WBGO, WNYC and WHYY at 7 pm.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \"It has not come up in one conversation and has not crossed my mind for one second\u201d \u2014 Gov. Phil Murphy yesterday on whether the bipartisan outcry in the Legislature over last week\u2019s storm led to his new aggressive posture on two minor upcoming weather systems\n\nWHAT TRENTON MADE\n\nFULL STOP \u2014 \u201cDid N.J. drop the ball and pass the blame for colossal storm fail? Here's how the chaos unfolded,\u2019 by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Brent Johnson: \u201cThree sources said contractors hired to plow state roads waited in frustration throughout Thursday morning without word from the state. Plows were not deployed until after 2 p.m., according to the sources. By then, the storm was getting worse, children were about to be sent home from school, and many workers across the state left early to beat the weather home. By rush hour, the snow was falling hard. Stephen Schapiro, a spokesman or the state Department of Transportation, said the agency always plans based on the weather predictions it's handed. \u2018The department deployed resources based on the forecast and adjusted as necessary as the forecast worsened,\u2019 Schapiro told NJ Advance Media. \u2018I think the storm came in a little harder and quicker than people expected.\u2019\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014 Public and politicians seethe over Murphy\u2019s storm response, by POLITICO\u2019s Matt Friedman: Gov. Phil Murphy is facing severe backlash after the state found itself unprepared for a rush hour winter storm Thursday that was worse than anyone had predicted. The storm, which dumped up to 10 inches on parts of New Jersey, left drivers stuck in traffic for hours. Nearly 1,000 crashes were reported on the slippery, untreated roads. The Port Authority bus terminal in Manhattan closed, sending New Jersey commuters to other delayed fates. Kids were stuck on school buses, while some sheltered overnight in schools. The Democratic governor, who was in Atlantic City for the New Jersey State League of Municipalities Conference, made sure to show his face on Thursday, calling into several TV and radio stations, urging \u201cpatience\u201d and blaming forecasters for not predicting the severity of the storm. At a press conference Friday, Murphy did not say the word \u201csorry,\u201d but accepted partial blame and promised to do better, including a postmortem of his administration\u2019s response.

Phil Murphy's 'aggressive' winter storm prep this week?,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Charles Stile: \u201cShell-shocked Gov. Phil Murphy is now determined to keep the snow off the roads over the next two days \u2014 and keep a political storm in the Statehouse from engulfing his administration. Murphy and his \u2018storm Cabinet\u2019 vowed Sunday night to take an \u2018aggressive\u2019 posture in the face of two feeble \u2018clipper\u2019 weather systems expected to sweep through the northwest corner of the state over the next two days. He was clearly hoping to avoid last a repeat of last Thursday's debacle, in which a larger-than-expected winter storm paralyzed portions of the state with snow and sleet, causing more than 1,000 vehicle accidents and turning the afternoon commute into a white-knuckled odyssey for hours on end. \u2018Are we being more cautious and more aggressive? Did Thursday contribute to it? The answer would have to be yes,'\u2019 Murphy said in a conference call with reporters.\u201d Read more here\n\nI HAD SALT IN MY KITCHEN BUT I DID NOT DUMP IT ON THE STREET. SORRY \u2014 \u201cDon't blame Gov. Murphy for the snowstorm traffic mess. We're all to blame,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Mark Di Ionno: \u201cEven though we got more snow than expected, the 4 to 6 inches first predicted would have been equally crippling for one reason: People didn't stay home. No, two reasons: People don't use common sense. So while Gov. Phil Murphy and the state transportation boss were gracious enough about their response, the fact is 1,800 trucks were on the roads ready to plow, but so were thousands upon thousands of people who went out and tried to get home as the snow piled up. The state police estimate they responded to 1,000 accidents. A snowplow is no use when it is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, or behind the bumper car pileup on, say, the hill-climb known as Route 280. \u2018Clearly, we could have done better,\u2019 Murphy said. And just as clearly, the public - and their employers -- could have been smarter.\u201d Read more here\n\nAND WITH THIS, WE\u2019VE THE SHARK IN STORM SCANDAL COVERAGE \u2014 \u201cHow nor'easter commute may be Phil Murphy's Bridgegate\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014Bucco: \u201cAssemblyman to Murphy: Everyone saw the storm coming, except you.

Murphy, state runs Atlantic City behind closed doors,\u201d by The Philadephia Inquirer\u2019s Amy S. Rosenberg: \u201cWhen Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver took control of Atlantic City under a state takeover, it's likely she did not anticipate overseeing a mayor and councilman caught up in a 2:30 a.m. brawl in a valet area outside a casino nightclub. Atlantic City, it must be said, always delivers \u2026 As none other than former Gov. Chris Christie pointed out, the mayor has almost no power anyway under the terms of the takeover that just entered its third year, its legal bills surpassing $5.8 million, its inner working no more transparent under Gov. Murphy than they were under Christie .. Under Christie, who took the reins in November 2016 after the Legislature passed the Municipal Stabilization and Recovery Act, decisions were made in a West Orange law firm helmed by longtime Christie ally Jeffrey Chiesa, whose law firm, Chiesa Shahinian & Giantomasi, billed expansively from top ($400 per hour) to paralegal ($90 an hour). Under Murphy, who took office Jan. 16, special counsel Jim Johnson is getting paid peanuts for taking over the job (\u2018I have another 25 to 30 cents to earn,\u2019 he quipped last Tuesday outside City Hall, where the second closed-door meeting of the Atlantic City Executive Council had just been held).

The report focuses on detainer requests that Immigration and Customs Enforcement makes to law enforcement agencies after local police arrest an undocumented immigrant. The ICE detainers are formal requests, made to officials at municipal police departments and county jails, to hold onto immigrants for 48 hours after they are due to be released on whatever local offenses they were initially arrested for. That gives ICE time to take them into custody. Local authorities are not required to honor ICE's requests, which skyrocketed 87.5 percent in New Jersey in 2017 compared to 2016.\u201d Read more here\n\nDOES HE LIVE IN NEW JERSEY YET? \u2014 \u201cChris Smith, NJ's sole surviving Republican in DC, expects GOP comeback in 2020,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Herb Jackson: \u201cAfter his party's worst congressional defeat in state history, Rep. Chris Smith will be the only Republican representing New Jersey in Washington next year. The 65-year-old Hamilton resident does not expect to be flying solo for long, however. \"I think it's going to be just for two years, and then some of those races will have different outcomes,\" Smith said. Smith attributes the thrashing the GOP took in losing four House seats to anger over President Donald Trump. And while Trump will be on the ballot in 2020, voters who want to can lash out at him directly, and then revert to their normal habit of picking Republicans for Congress, Smith said.\u201d Read more here\n\nPALLONE POISED TO INHERIT \u2018FRANK THE FOSSIL\u2019 NICKNAME \u2014 Democratic opponents of \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 committee received big fossil fuel donations,\u201d by Read Sludge\u2019s Alex Kotch: \u201cRep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) will likely become the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. While his statements and voting record show that he wants to reduce America\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, his campaign contributions muddle that message. The proposed select committee would not allow its members to accept campaign donations from fossil fuel company PACs, a direct conflict of interest to the committee\u2019s agenda. This means that Pallone would not be able to join unless he drastically changes his fundraising strategy. Pallone has received $178,000 from energy and natural resources interests in just the 2017-18 election cycle alone, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014Two plead not guilty in Hoboken cash-for-votes federal probe\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014 Climate protesters storm Pallone's office Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201cWill women help bring down America's most powerful woman? | Moran\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201cBooker and Trump line up on the same side as Congress mulls criminal justice legislation\u201d Read more here\n\nLOCAL\n\nMAYOR, COUNCILMAN\u2019S CONDUCT NOTWITHSTANDING \u2014 \u201cSo what's behind the drop in crime in Atlantic City?\u201d by The Press of Atlantic City\u2019s Molly Bilinski: \u201cCrime in the city is a third of what it was five years ago, according to statistics released by the Atlantic City Police Department, and locals and out-of-towners alike said they\u2019ve noticed the difference \u2026 The third-quarter stats released in October showed that both violent crimes, including murder, rape, aggravated and simple assault, and robbery; and property crimes, including motor vehicle theft, larceny and burglary, are down 36 percent and 35 percent, respectively, from the same period last year \u2026 The reduction in crime can be attributed to the department\u2019s use of technology and community policing efforts, Deputy Chief James Sarkos said.\u201d Read more here\n\n\u201cJudge Russo joked,'Did you hear that sex stuff?': attorney,\u201d by Kathleen Hopkins: \u201cAfter Superior Court Judge John F.

Maureen G. Bauman, disciplinary counsel for the state Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct, dropped the bombshell as Russo's disciplinary hearing before the committee continued. Bauman revealed that the court's recording system picked up Russo's off-the-record conversation with his staff following the conclusion of a 2016 hearing at which the judge \u2014 who is on paid administrative leave from his seat in the Family Division of Superior Court in Ocean County \u2014 denied a restraining order for a woman who claimed she had been raped in an act of domestic violence.\u201d Read more here\n\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS TO CONTINUE CLAIMING THIS ISN\u2019T BECAUSE OF TRUMP \u2014 \u201cBig Trump Slump hits Morris County, with less impact in Bergen and Passaic,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Dave Sheingold: \u201cA nationwide run away by voters from the Republican Party in last week's elections \u2014 widely seen as a negative reaction to President Donald Trump \u2014 hit full-force in Morris County, where long-beleaguered Democrats saw notable gains at the GOP's expense. Democrats didn't exactly win control this year across Morris County, as Republicans won a majority of races in the county government as well as township and borough halls. But Democrats improved their vote totals throughout much of the county, a traditional Republican stronghold similar to well-educated suburban areas around the nation that fled the GOP midway through Trump's first term. In all county and municipal races combined, Democrats got 44 percent of the votes after getting only 36 percent in 2016\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014Riordan: \u201cCamden school and zoning board decisions reveal that \u2018home rule\u2019 has limits in the city\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014 Cost to residents a concern as Newark begins replacing lead pipes Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201c\u2018No secret agreements\u2019: Newarkers demand details of district-charter enrollment deal\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201cTrenton superintendent falsely claims school district not involved in security firm lawsuit\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201cTrenton mayor calls bomb threat that occurs same day as security guard walkout 'highly suspect\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201cJudge won't recuse self from Cherry Hill Costco lawsuit\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201cHoboken officials to hold public meeting to discuss city response to legalized weed\u201d Read more here\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE\n\nR.I.P. \u2014 \u201cNewark artist leaves behind a legacy of prolific work,\u201d by WNYC\u2019s Shumita Basu: \u201cIf you've taken a walk around Newark, New Jersey, chances are you've seen Jerry Gant's work.

Let\u2019s count the ways: On Monday and Tuesday, there was a massive backlash from City Council members and some New Yorkers to the announcement that Amazon will site a new headquarters in Long Island City; on Wednesday, a federal judge denied a consent decree the city had reached over NYCHA, on the grounds it would do too little to address the Housing Authority\u2019s mammoth set of problems; on Thursday, a freak rush-hour snowstorm left New Yorkers and their children stranded in traffic for hours, enraging commuters and City Council members alike; and on Friday, de Blasio\u2019s firing of his own investigations commissioner Mark Peters, a frequent de Blasio critic, prompted questions about de Blasio\u2019s motivation for dismissing him.\n\nThe weekend didn\u2019t exactly wipe the slate clean.\n\nA 3,500-word New York Times investigation on A1 of the paper today exposes NYCHA\u2019s practice of routinely challenging the city\u2019s Health Department when health inspectors found lead paint in Housing Authority buildings, rather than accepting the results and remedying them. The story lays a significant amount of blame on former Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s administration, under whose tenure the practice flourished. But de Blasio\u2019s administration continued the practice, and he\u2019s the one in office now, left holding the bag. De Blasio will face more questions today from the press corps about NYCHA, while Bloomberg reaps positive press for a $1.8 billion gift to his former alma mater Johns Hopkins University and flirts with a run for president in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, the Amazon anger shows little sign of abating, and the mayor, who has remained pro-labor throughout his tenure in City Hall, is facing another war on the Amazon front from some of his typical union allies.\n\nThe city\u2019s retail and department store workers union, RWDSU, and its allies from UFCW, Workers United, SEIU, Make the Road New York, New York Communities for Change (NYCC) and ALIGN are launching a campaign today attacking the Amazon HQ2 deal and the company\u2019s treatment of its workers, after de Blasio defended the city\u2019s deal with the company in the pages of the Daily News over the weekend.\n\nDe Blasio has argued that Amazon, which does not have a unionized workforce, may somehow become more receptive to unionization after its move to Long Island City, through the process of osmosis. Labor leaders thought that was nonsense.\n\nThe RWDSU coalition\u2019s campaign is similar to the successful one it launched years ago, which de Blasio was a part of, to prevent Walmart from coming to New York City. Now de Blasio finds himself facing off against labor, instead of fighting alongside it.\n\nIT\u2019S MONDAY. Got tips, suggestions or thoughts? Let us know ...

Aides to the mayor confirmed Peters was summoned early Friday afternoon to the city\u2019s Law Department office, where Fuleihan offered him a chance to resign. When he refused, he was fired. De Blasio was not at the meeting, which sources said lasted about 90 seconds. Peters\u2019 dismissal follows years of public dispute between himself and both the mayor and the city\u2019s corporation counsel, Zachary Carter. Several City Hall sources said tensions flared in 2016, when Peters threatened to seize computer servers from de Blasio officials amid a series of investigations. The sources said he even warned he might show up with armed guards. Before approving his appointment in 2014, a few Council members questioned Peters' independence from the administration given his friendship with de Blasio. The Council ultimately signed off. The mayor nominated Margaret Garnett, who currently serves as executive deputy attorney general, to replace Peters, subject to City Council approval.

Fight Over Nancy Pelosi: Just get it out of your systems now, please\u201d: With a large freshman class on its way and the Democratic Party in the midst of a roaring debate about its core values, there will, of course, be clashes about who will have what kind of influence in the caucus, and which voices will lead the way. \u2026\n\n\u201cMany incoming Democrats ran on the promise of disrupting the status quo. And there\u2019s a wide range of views about the degree to which the party should try to work with President Trump on issues of shared interest versus pursuing a path of total resistance.

Change in Congress can be darn near impossible. And convincing powerful members who have been well-served by the existing system to tinker with that system requires more than a gentle nudge.

While Ms. Pelosi is seeking their support, they can lobby for rule changes to empower the rank-and-file, to reform how chairmanships are assigned, to put in place programs aimed at nurturing young talent \u2014 or maybe even to extract a promise that she will step gracefully aside in 2020.\u201d NYT\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), who in 2016 flipped a seat long held by Republicans, said the financial services panel \u201cought to be able to walk and chew gum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good opportunity for more access to credit and housing reforms,\u201d he said. \u201cOversight\u2019s important, but I just think we\u2019ve got a broader responsibility.\"\n\nHimes, a committee member who chairs the centrist New Democrat Coalition and also serves on the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats should be mindful of punishment that Republicans received after antagonizing President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"There are enough questions around Deutsche Bank that it's worth getting some answers,\u201d he said. \"But again, I think we're going to need to make sure that we don't get too carried away on investigations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the only potential conflict Waters is facing. She\u2019ll also likely confront resistance from moderate Democrats on the committee who aren\u2019t eager to bash bankers. Some have been willing to work with Republicans to ease rules for large financial institutions in recent years, even when Waters wasn\u2019t.\n\nFinance industry watchdogs are hoping that Waters will use her gavel to advance new consumer protections and shine a light on how the Trump administration's and Wall Street's wrongdoing may be hurting Americans.\n\nThey\u2019re less interested in exposing Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. Dennis Kelleher, who advocates for tougher Wall Street regulation as president of the nonprofit Better Markets, said Deutsche Bank\u2019s business conduct is worth an investigation but the American people don\u2019t care whether Trump got a loan from the bank \u201c20 years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people are sick and tired of politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the Democrats have to do is have a robust policy agenda that concretely resonates with Main Street Americans, who care about their jobs and their wages and their retirements.\u201d\n\nWith Democrats raising concerns, Waters in recent days has sought to reassure her colleagues that she will focus on policy and that investigations will not bog down the committee, lawmakers say. She gave what Himes said was a \"very deliberate and thoughtful\" presentation to members.\n\nWaters has said she wants to tackle housing, credit reporting reform and supporting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has touted her pragmatism and ability to work across the aisle, including a bipartisan bill she negotiated this year to ease financial market rules.\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), a senior committee member, said policy will be the committee\u2019s main priority and that investigating Deutsche Bank will not be a focus, despite the attention it\u2019s getting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming here to try to get some stuff done,\u201d he said.\n\nBut even drilling down on Wall Street may be a challenge for Waters, who once called for Wells Fargo to be broken up in light of the fake customer-account scandal that affected potentially millions of Americans. She has introduced legislation that would punish big banks that hurt their customers by threatening to put them out of business. She has cited that bill as one of her accomplishments in her pitch for chairwoman.\n\nBefore the election, Waters jarred the financial industry by pledging at an event to do to banks \u201cwhat you did to us,\u201d a moment captured on video that went viral. It\u2019s a tone that\u2019s not going to be echoed by a number of other Democrats on the committee.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure we take care of folks, but I don\u2019t think the answer is going after sectors writ large,\u201d Gottheimer said. \u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d\n\nSome committee Democrats such as Gottheimer have received significant backing from the financial industry and have been more willing to support policies that would benefit the largest banks.\n\nWhen Waters led a letter to the Federal Reserve in September asking the central bank to refrain from lowering big bank capital requirements, it tellingly contained signatures from only about half the committee\u2019s Democrats.\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), a senior member of the panel, said his constituents in the finance industry \u201cwant a fair shake.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, sometimes you have people on Main Street who say let\u2019s get rid of Wall Street, and you have Wall Street who\u2019s insensitive to the needs of Main Street,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out how we can bring the two together \u2014 force the industry to be more transparent and open with Main Street and Main Street beginning to know and feeling that they\u2019re not going to be taken advantage of by Wall Street.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Alex Thompson", "title": "Inclusivity, allyship and POC: 2020 Democrats go all-in on identity politics", "description": "They're shrugging off fears of driving more white voters to Donald Trump.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/19/democrats-2020-race-identity-politics-strategy-1000249", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/5e/2f/7f49cfa7434889d32f4ae485249d/181118-kamala-harris-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T10:05:18Z", "content": "Potential 2020 candidates of color like Sen.

In another speech, Warren dismissed \u201cthe pundits\u201d who argue that \u201cDemocrats have to choose between being the party of the white working class and the party of Black Lives Matter.\u201d\n\nAfter coasting to reelection this month in New York, Gillibrand declared in her victory speech that \u201cit all started with the Women\u2019s March \u2014 an intersectional moment when you could march with your sign \u2014 regardless of what it said \u2014 women\u2019s reproductive rights, Black Lives Matter, clean air and clean water, LGBTQ equality.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to her supporters, Gillibrand again nodded to intersectionality \u2014 a framework that considers overlapping prejudices people face \u2014 writing that \u201cresistance is female, intersectional and powered by our belief in one another.\"\n\nAnd in Sanders\u2019 forthcoming book, \u201cWhere We Go From Here,\u201d the Vermont senator argues that \u201c[s]everal years ago, the abominations of our criminal justice system were not widely discussed.\u201d He goes on to credit Black Lives Matter and the ACLU for fighting a system \u201cthat was racist and that criminalized poverty.\u201d It's a shift in emphasis for Sanders, who said after the 2016 election that \u201c[o]ne of the struggles that you\u2019re going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics.\"\n\nThe embrace of inclusivity-focused politics on the left has been growing for years with the rise of groups like Black Lives Matter and Dreamers. But Trump has pushed it to the forefront of the progressive movement, especially among younger voters.\n\n\u201cIntersectionality feels obvious to younger progressives in the way that LGBTQ rights do,\u201d said Amanda Litman, co-founder and executive director of Run For Something, which recruited thousands of young progressives to run for local and state office in the aftermath of the 2016 election.\n\nMany progressive grass-roots organizations are instituting new training and programs to improve their approach to race. Indivisible, the largest \u201cresistance\u201d group of the Trump era, recently held its first mandatory virtual training; more than 300 group leaders across the country tuned in. The topic: \u201cDirect Voter Contact through a Racial Equity Lens.\u201d\n\nRegan Byrd, the host of the training, formed her own \u201canti-oppression consulting\u201d firm in December 2017 and she said business has been good. \u201cI\u2019m a little shocked about how much momentum there\u2019s been,\u201d she said.\n\nIndivisible said its leadership and grass-roots members will be evaluating 2020 candidates with these issues in mind. \u201cWe \u2026 expect candidates \u2014 and the broader progressive movement \u2014 to commit to an inclusive and motivating message in 2020 that addresses both economic and racial inequality,\" said Maria Urbina, the group\u2019s national political director.\n\nThe recent, more explicit rhetoric on race among potential 2020 Democratic hopefuls \u2014 who, to varying degrees, have addressed racial issues for years \u2014 is at least partly strategic. Black voters are likely to be decisive in many 2020 primaries, especially in the South.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly simple--s/he who wins the black vote, wins the primary,\u201d one adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign said in a text message.\n\nIt was no accident that Clinton\u2019s first major policy speech during her 2016 campaign was about race and the criminal justice system. \u201cIt's time to end the era of mass incarceration,\u201d she said at Columbia University in April 2015. Clinton frequently discussed implicit bias on the campaign trail and used the term \u201csystemic racism\u201d in her Democratic National Convention speech accepting the nomination, the first major party nominee to do so. But she was an imperfect messenger for those policies given that her husband signed the 1994 crime bill that contributed to the era she was condemning.\n\nTrump has helped bring race to center stage for the 2020 Democratic primary and in the process has raised questions as to whether the party can maintain the tenuous coalition of enormous black majorities and white working class voters outside the South it has maintained since the 1960s. People across the Democratic Party agree that race should be part of the discussion, but there is disagreement about how big a part of the discussion it should be compared to issues like health care and jobs.\n\nPotential 2020 candidates publicly profess that it\u2019s not an either-or scenario. But Clinton herself has said that her focus on issues disproportionately affecting black voters, such as the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, may have alienated white voters. \"I don't know if my advocacy for the heavily African American community of Flint alienated white voters in other parts of Michigan but it certainly didn't seem to help, as I lost the state narrowly in both the primary and the general election,\" she wrote in her post-election book, \"What Happened.\"\n\nUltimately, choices will have to be made about which issues to focus on and how much energy to expend on turning out the Democratic base versus persuading white voters who\u2019ve been leaving the party.\n\nBut the answers to these questions could determine whether Democrats zero in on trying to win back the Midwestern and whiter states they lost in 2016, such as Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 or to go through states with more diverse populations like Arizona, Texas, Georgia and Florida.\n\n\u201cThere is no strategy to get the presidency back that doesn\u2019t include winning or being competitive in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Period,\u201d said Tom Russell, who recently managed the Democratic Party\u2019s independent expenditure group in the Wisconsin governor\u2019s race, a big success for Democrats. \u201cThe diversity that exists in our coalition that doesn\u2019t exist in the Republican coalition is something that has to be discussed, but at the end of the day they also have to have a sort of meat and potatoes message.\u201d\n\nStrategically sound or not, \u201cidentity politics\u201d isn\u2019t going anywhere. And candidates are learning the hard way that there\u2019s less room for error than ever, especially if they are white.\n\nWarren faced a backlash over the rollout of her DNA test to debunk Trump\u2019s claims she lied about her Native American roots. The criticism came not only from her conservative detractors, but also from many on the left who felt she was trying to appropriate the identity of a marginalized group to settle a political controversy.\n\nSanders recently prompted furor online when he tried to explain why Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams \u2014 African-American gubernatorial candidates in Florida and Georgia, respectively \u2014 appeared to lose.\n\n\u201c[T]here are a lot of white folks out there who are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an African-American,\u201d Sanders told the Daily Beast . In context, it was clear Sanders was trying to condemn the racism he believes both candidates faced,but many on the left felt he was making excuses for white racists as being merely \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d\n\nOther white potential candidates, such as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Vice President Joe Biden, are receiving renewed scrutiny over their records. Bloomberg stirred controversy this fall when he defended his controversial stop-and-frisk policy as mayor and said he thinks Democrats will agree with him on policing.\n\n\u201cI think people, the voters, want low crime...They don\u2019t want kids to kill each other,\u201d he told The New York Times. And Biden, if he runs, will almost certainly be asked about the 1994 crime bill he helped write as a senator. Many on the left now see the legislation, viewed at the time as the Democratic Party moving to the center to try to look tough on crime, as helping to institutionalize mass incarceration.\n\nPerhaps to avoid gaffes, several of the potential 2020 candidates are taking steps to become more fluent when talking about race.\n\nWarren has been consulting with the think tank Demos, which focuses on inequality, to integrate their language about combining race and class into a single narrative into her speeches, a flurry of which she\u2019s given to civil rights groups. Gillibrand has been a regular visitor to Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network since she became a senator in 2009 and earlier this year met with Rutgers professor Brittney Cooper after reading her book, \u201cEloquent Rage: A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower.\u201d\n\nSanders, for his part, has been holding rallies with Black Lives Matter organizers and asking allies like activist Shaun King and Our Revolution President Nina Turner how he can improve.\n\n\u201cHe gets it,\u201d Turner, a black former state senator from Ohio, said of Sanders. \u201cHe may not articulate it always as crisp as it needs to be, but he does have a heart for marginalized people.\u201d\n\nNina Turner appears with Bernie Sanders at a campaign event in 2016. \u201cHe may not articulate it always as crisp as it needs to be, but he does have a heart for marginalized people,\u201d she said. | Mary Altaffer/AP Photo\n\nStill, some people close to Sanders say he has not added enough people of color to his inner circle or his staff, pointing to the fact that 82 percent of his Senate staff is white, according to the recently instituted Senate Democrats Diversity initiative , which provided data on all the Senate offices as of mid-2018. By contrast, Warren\u2019s office is 64 percent white, Gillibrand\u2019s is 47 percent, Booker\u2019s is 37 percent and Harris\u2019 is 34 percent. (An aide to Sanders said four of the senator's eight hires the past year have been people of color.)\n\nPotential candidates of color like Booker, Harris and Castro are also speaking directly and forcefully about race in ways that most past presidential candidates from minority groups did not.\n\nBooker regularly gets onstage and tells the crowd that he\u2019s there to \u201cget folk woke.\u201d Harris has said that the phrase \u201cidentity politics\u201d is deployed \u201cto minimize and marginalize issues that impact all of us. It\u2019s used to try and shut us up.\u201d And Castro\u2019s PAC, dubbed Opportunity First, made a point of supporting candidates of color in 2018; more than half of its endorsees were people of color.\n\nAll three of them have set out to support and assemble networks of minority candidates across the country.\n\nThe frank talk about race contrasts with Obama\u2019s first campaign and time in office, when he and his team took great pains to appear more a candidate who happens to be black than the black candidate. \u201c[T]here's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America,\" he said in his famous 2004 speech at the Democratic convention.\n\nWhen Obama did wade into racial politics \u2014 such as when he mourned the shooting of Trayvon Martin and said \u201cIf I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon\u201d \u2014 he often did so gingerly. Even then, he was accused by conservative critics of playing \u201cthe race card\u201d and criticized by some liberals over his policy of mass deportations and not doing enough to close the racial wealth gap.\n\nAsked in 2015 for a Vice Media special on American prisons whether the system was \u201cracist,\u201d Obama wasn\u2019t willing to say what Warren and Sanders do now. \u201cI think the criminal justice system interacts with broader patterns of society in a way that results in injustice and unfairness,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that was then, before Trump.\n\n\u201cIt is inescapable and unavoidable in this country that we have to take on race in a big way,\u201d said Cecile Richards, the former president of Planned Parenthood who campaigned for Democrats across the country this past election cycle. \u201cI\u2019d say up until a couple years ago, there wasn\u2019t enough appreciation of that.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s dog whistles have made white liberals far more receptive to discussions of systemic racism. From May 2015 just before Trump declared his candidacy to June 2017, Democratic support for the statement \u201cimmigrants today strengthen the country,\u201d increased 20 points, from 62 percent to 82 percent, according to Pew Research Center. The percentage of Democrats who agreed that \u201cracial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can\u2019t get ahead these days\u201d went from 44 percent in February 2014 to 66 percent in June 2017, also according to Pew Research Center. Among white liberals, 79 percent agreed with that statement.\n\nAn early sign of the hunger for a Democratic politician to talk about race \u2014 and the potential political consequences \u2014 came in August, when Democratic Texas Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke took a question at a town hall about NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. While the questioner was a Republican plant wanting to help Ted Cruz on a topic that he believed would help Republicans, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s nuanced but unequivocal defense of athletes like Colin Kaepernick went viral on the left and helped O\u2019Rourke, a potential 2020 candidate himself, raise a record-shattering $38 million over three months. Still, Cruz, who narrowly won the race, used O'Rourke's answer to attack him with a campaign ad featuring a veteran who lost two legs in Vietnam.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/2812/1155968404_5969014846001_5969016377001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThis may only be the beginning.

But the prospect of a presidential bid by O\u2019Rourke, whose charismatic Senate candidacy captured the party\u2019s imagination, has suddenly rewired the race.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nO\u2019Rourke \u2014 who raised a stunning $38 million in the third quarter of his race \u2014 is widely considered capable of raising millions of dollars quickly, according to interviews with multiple Democratic money bundlers and strategists, catapulting him into the upper echelons of the 2020 campaign.\n\nMikal Watts, a San Antonio-based lawyer and major Democratic money bundler, said several donors and political operatives in Iowa, after hearing from other potential candidates in recent days, have called to ask whether O\u2019Rourke is running, a sign of his impact in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not wanting to sign on to other presidential campaigns until they know whether Beto is going,\u201d Watts said. \u201cAnd if Beto is running, what good progressive Democrat wouldn\u2019t want to work for Beto O\u2019Rourke?\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Ted Cruz, mostly from small donors in a race that captured national attention. Though he fell short \u2014 losing 51 percent to 48 percent \u2014 his closer-than-expected performance in the largest red state on the map was credited with lifting at least two Democrats to victory over House Republican incumbents.\n\nA POLITICO/Morning Consult presidential primary poll last week put O\u2019Rourke in third place among Democratic voters, behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s game changing,\u201d said Robert Wolf, an investment banker who helped raise Wall Street money for Obama in 2008 and 2012. \u201cIf he decides to run, he will be in the top five. You can\u2019t deny the electricity and excitement around the guy.\u201d\n\nAlthough other prominent Democrats, including Biden, Sanders and Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have support networks of their own, Wolf said, \u201cBeto comes out of [the midterm elections] saying, \u2018Oh my God, if a guy can do well in Texas, he certainly can do well throughout the country as a Democrat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get the hype,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI think there\u2019s an incredible amount of excitement around Beto. A lot of people have comparisons around him and a Robert Kennedy or a Barack Obama. And the [Democratic] Party likes young, ambitious and aspirational.\u201d\n\nThe ascent of O\u2019Rourke, a three-term congressman from El Paso, reflects the volatility of a 2020 presidential primary that has flummoxed Democratic donors and activists for months. Many fundraisers who have exclusively supported a single candidate in previous years are expected to hedge their bets initially, spreading smaller amounts among several candidates.\n\nOne major Democratic bundler on the West Coast told POLITICO he is advising donors against throwing in with one candidate, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s naivete, it\u2019s political suicide to do that.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke is a major reason for donors' uncertainty, the bundler said, having \u201cbrought a whole bunch of new people off the sidelines.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/2812/1155968404_5969014846001_5969016377001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s this cycle\u2019s \u2018Bernie army\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s \u2018Beto\u2019s Army,\u2019\u201d he said, comparing O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate fundraising to the crush of small donors who propelled Sanders in his unsuccessful 2016 primary campaign.\n\n\u201cAll the guy would have to do is send out an email to his fundraising base \u2026 and he raises $30 million,\u201d the bundler said. \u201cThat has totally changed the landscape for the tier 1 guys, because now Bernie and Warren, now they have competition. It completely changes the game if Beto runs. And he should run. \u2026 He\u2019s Barack Obama, but white.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke said before the midterm elections that he would not run for president, promising to serve six years in the Senate if elected. When asked at a CNN town hall whether he would run for president if he did not win the Senate race, O\u2019Rourke responded, \u201cIf I don\u2019t win, we\u2019re back in El Paso.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats have not taken O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments as ruling out a run.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a decision that he has to make as to whether or not he\u2019s going to run for president,\u201d Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s waiting to see what Beto\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\nAsked about a potential presidential run, O\u2019Rourke told the website TMZ on Friday, \u201cI haven\u2019t made any decisions about anything.\u201d\n\nFor Democratic strategists eager to advance a younger nominee contrasting with President Donald Trump, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s appeal rests on his perceived ability to bridge a gulf within the party \u2014 between Democratic contenders who are older but come with pre-existing donor networks, and Democrats who are younger but have not yet developed a substantial fundraising base. O\u2019Rourke, at 46, has both.\n\n\u201cPeople across the country just fell in love with him,\u201d said Christian Archer, a San Antonio-based Democratic strategist. \u201cHe was able to raise national-level money, and that\u2019s just such a distinct advantage.\u201d\n\nHowever, Archer said, \u201cThere\u2019s a fuse on that, and the question is how long will that last if he doesn\u2019t make a move within a window of time.\u201d\n\nArcher said, \u201cRight now, he\u2019s on fire.\u201d\n\nIf O\u2019Rourke is giving donors any pause, it is largely because his fundraising came in a Senate contest, not a presidential primary stuffed full of marquee Democrats. New York Republican Rick Lazio, who set a single-quarter fundraising record in his losing New York Senate bid against Hillary Clinton in 2000 \u2014 a record surpassed by O\u2019Rourke \u2014 failed to translate energy from that campaign into future political success. And in a lengthy presidential race, early stars can fade.\n\nGeorge Tsunis, the hotel magnate and Obama megadonor, said O\u2019Rourke \u201cperformed very admirably\u201d in the Senate race. But he was skeptical that O\u2019Rourke could replicate his fundraising in a presidential race, saying many donors were likely motivated by anti-Cruz sentiment.\n\nStill, Tsunis acknowledged the donor universe remains wide open. \u201cA lot of people that I\u2019m talking to are in a quandary,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may have a half a dozen friends that are looking to do this, and they are so unbelievably torn here.\u201d\n\nThere isn\u2019t much modern historical precedent for O\u2019Rourke to draw on. George H.W. Bush was a Texas congressman who won the presidency after an unsuccessful 1970 Senate bid. But his presidential run didn\u2019t come until years later \u2014 and it took Bush two tries before he won the White House.\n\nAbraham Lincoln ran for president \u2014 and won \u2014 after two losing campaigns for Senate. But the last person to go from the House to the presidency was James Garfield in 1880.\n\n\"One thing that [O\u2019Rourke] is going to have to overcome is that he did lose to Ted Cruz,\" said Cappy McGarr, a Dallas-based investor and Democratic fundraiser. \u201cHe is the real deal, though. He\u2019s charismatic, he\u2019s thoughtful, he\u2019s able \u2014 he is one of the most exciting politicians I\u2019ve seen since Barack Obama ran for president.\u201d\n\nLike many donors, however, McGarr holds a favorable view of several potential contenders, including Biden, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and Obama Cabinet secretary.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of friends who might be running for president, and I think the more the merrier,\u201d McGarr said. \u201cAnd I certainly wouldn\u2019t preclude giving and raising monies for more than one candidate.\u201d\n\nSteve Westly, a former California state controller and major bundler of campaign contributions for Obama, said O\u2019Rourke \u201chas a lot of the wow factor now, and one could easily say, \u2018He didn\u2019t win.\u2019 But to get [close] in Texas, that suggests to me that if he were the national nominee running against a non-Texan, he might well pull that state \u2026 and he is charismatic as heck.\u201d\n\nWestly said he does not \u201chave complete conviction yet\u201d about which candidate to support, with a primary field that appears \u201ccompletely, totally different than anything I\u2019ve seen in the last half century.\u201d\n\nStill, as he begins to field calls from potential candidates, Westly said he believes Democratic voters are \u201clooking for newer faces outside the traditional Northeast corridor\u201d of typical Democratic politicians, mentioning Bloomberg and Starbucks founder Howard Schultz, among others, as credible potential candidates.\n\nMost years, Westly said, \u201cGuys like me can say, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s going to be one or two people, it\u2019s person A, B or C, here\u2019s why. It\u2019s a short discussion \u2026 it\u2019s five minutes, we can narrow it down.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, he said, \u201cHere you have something fundamentally different. \u2026 In terms of betting odds, it\u2019s really hard to sort out.\u201d\n\nBut Watts said O\u2019Rourke could immediately narrow the field.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that 50-year-old guys like me and 60-year-old guys in Washington who are in an hourly form of political warfare understand how disillusioned that warfare has made the younger people of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom that perspective, Beto\u2019s unvarnished approach was both refreshing to me, but intoxicating to the younger generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Bernie runs and Warren runs and Kamala runs and [Cory] Booker runs, I think they all wash each other out in a certain way,\" Watts said. \u201cBeto\u2019s got the juice right now.

Her letter was not immediately available, nor was the exact date of her resignation clear, the paper reported.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNorris-Weeks told the Sun Sentinel that the 75-year-old Snipes wanted to spend more time with her family.\n\nHad she not quit, she faced the likelihood of being forced into retirement, POLITICO first reported last week, either by outgoing Gov. Rick Scott or incoming Gov.-elect Ron DeSantis, after Broward County became the poster child for another botched Florida election. Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera might also be in a position to suspend her if Scott leaves office a few days early in January due to the start of the new Congress following his election to the U.S. Senate.\n\nSnipes' office failed to regularly provide vote total updates to the state every 45 minutes as the numbers came in, causing tens of thousands of votes in the races for U.S. Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner to seemingly materialize out of thin air. That resulted in the Republicans\u2019 margins shrinking due to the vast number of votes in the Democratic stronghold of Broward, Florida\u2019s second-most populous county.\n\nThen, when Scott\u2019s Senate campaign asked for basic information concerning the number of votes remaining to be counted \u2014 information that should have been readily available \u2014 Snipes was unable or unwilling to provide it. Scott prevailed.\n\n\u201cEvery Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward counties,\u201d Scott said on Nov. 8, leveling an accusation of criminal wrongdoing that he couldn\u2019t support. \u201cAnd Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes has a history of acting in bad faith.\u201d\n\nDuring the recount, Snipes\u2019 attorney told the news media that she had mistakenly commingled 22 questionable ballots in a pile of votes submitted to the state. But Snipes later denied that. She then submitted the results of the first machine recount late to the state.\n\nThen, during a manual recount, she could not account for about 2,000 ballots.\n\n\u201cThe ballots are in the building. The ballots are in the building,\u201d Snipes told reporters Saturday, though she was unable to say exactly where they were.\n\nDemocrats also are upset with Snipes. The ballot she designed for the election tucked the U.S. Senate race in the bottom left-hand corner of the page under the instructions. As many as many as 25,000 voters did not vote in the race \u2014 perhaps because they did not see the candidates' names \u2014 making the county's undervote rate in the Senate race disproportionately high, compared with other counties.\n\nSome Democrats believe that the bad ballot design might have cost Sen. Bill Nelson his seat, which he lost by just 10,033 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast.\n\nThe 2018 midterms weren\u2019t the office\u2019s first brush with controversy. It broke federal law by destroying ballots that a failed candidate had a legal right to review, a judge ruled this year. About the same time, Snipes lost a court case against the Republican Party of Florida over the way she handled vote-by-mail absentee ballots. In 2016, she sent out a handful of misprinted absentee ballots as well.\n\nAs far back as 2004 \u2014 her first major election as supervisor \u2014 Snipes reported that 58,000 absentee ballots were lost.\n\nThe problems in Broward preceded Snipes. Her predecessor, Miriam Oliphant, was suspended from office by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in 2003 after botching the 2002 primary. He replaced her with Snipes, who was subsequently reelected. Along with President Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, Bush called on either Scott or DeSantis to kick Snipes out of office.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes failed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians\u2019 confidence in our electoral process,\u201d Bush said on Twitter last Monday. \u201cSupervisor Snipes should be removed from her office following the recounts.\u201d"}]
