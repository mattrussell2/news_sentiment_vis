Scott Walker arrives at an event held to announce Foxconn's plan to purchase an office building in Milwaukee on Feb. 6. Shifting public sentiment over the Foxconn project contributed to Walker's defeat. | Scott Olson/Getty Images Technology What are the risks of the Amazon deal? Ask Scott Walker. Opponents of Amazon\u2019s public giveaways say those governing Virginia and New York should take heed.\n\nThe more than $3 billion in taxpayer subsidies being lavished on Amazon\u2019s new East Coast headquarters are dredging up a cautionary tale from the heartland \u2014 the fate of Wisconsin\u2019s once-hyped Foxconn deal.\n\nIt was just last year that the Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer landed an initial $3 billion in economic incentives to open a plant in Wisconsin, in a seeming triumph for Republican Gov. Scott Walker and President Donald Trump. \"This is a great day for American workers,\" the president enthused from the White House at the announcement 16 months ago, portraying Foxconn\u2019s arrival as a vindication of his \u201cMade in the USA\u201d economic agenda.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut then came more than a year of sour aftertaste about the tax breaks, regulatory rollbacks and other favors that Wisconsin was handing Foxconn. The cost of the state incentives continued to climb while the size of the factory and number of new jobs appeared to be shrinking \u2014 a reality that may have contributed to Walker\u2019s ouster at the polls last week.\n\nOpponents of Amazon\u2019s public giveaways say the leaders governing Virginia and New York should take heed.\n\n\"The fact that Walker didn\u2019t get reelected after announcing the biggest potential state deal in history speaks volumes,\" said Greg LeRoy, executive director of the nonpartisan watchdog group Good Jobs First, which promotes accountability in economic development.\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

By contrast, Amazon is an American outfit whose rapid expansion across the country has been well documented.\n\nBut the massive cost of the tax credits, cash grants and other incentives that lured Amazon to place its new headquarters in Crystal City, Va., and New York City\u2019s Queens borough is sparking fierce pushback against \"corporate welfare\" from both ends of the political spectrum. Skeptics say the negotiation process with the company lacked community input, and they argue that taxpayer money would be better spent on crumbling infrastructure.\n\n\"I am opposing this deal as it stands, and will do all in my power to fight its implementation,\" Jumaane Williams, a New York City council member representing Brooklyn, pledged in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPublic review is absolutely essential to assess the promised benefits of such a large project, its impact on the community, public transit and infrastructure and to ensure that commitments to the community are kept,\" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who represents the district to which Amazon is moving. \"That now must happen and I intend to make sure it does. A beneficial deal will withstand public scrutiny.\u201d\n\nDemocrats who brokered the deals nevertheless praised their potential impact. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that Amazon's arrival will make Queens \"part of the economy of tomorrow,\" while Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam \"proudly\" declared that his state's \"proposal represents good fiscal stewardship.\u201d\n\nEconomic development officials project that the arrival of Amazon will contribute incremental tax revenue of $3.2 billion in Virginia and $10 billion in New York over the next 20 years. The influx of highly skilled workers could also attract other companies to their regions or spawn spin-off companies or tech startups in the future.\n\nAmazon declined to comment for this story. The company said as part of its announcement Tuesday that \"economic incentives were one factor in our decision \u2014 but attracting top talent was the leading driver\" in its choice of Northern Virginia and New York City over 18 other finalists.\n\nIt's difficult to track the final cost of corporate subsidies and how many companies follow through on promises because reporting requirements vary across the country. But more than 20 companies have received government handouts worth $1 billion or more since 1976, including Boeing, Alcoa, Ford, General Motors, Nike and Intel, according to Good Jobs First.\n\n\"If politicians think these deals are going to help them, I think they should think twice,\" said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute.\n\nGovernments can structure the deals to hedge against some of the risks. In Virginia and New York, the financial perks that go directly to Amazon's bottom line will be paid over time and require the company to fulfill its promise of hiring 25,000 people with an average salary of $150,000. If Amazon fails to deliver, it won't get all the money.\n\nThe investments in education and transit will, in theory, benefit other businesses and area residents, though they're funded on the premise that Amazon will generate increased tax revenue. Virginia, for example, is putting millions into expanding science and technology education, and Virginia Tech will shell out $1 billion to build a graduate school just two miles from Amazon's new offices there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start but \u2026 the devil is in the details,\" said Aaron Chatterji, a former senior economist on President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Chatterji, now a professor at Duke University, has proposed replacing corporate subsidies with investments in entrepreneurship.\n\n\"How are they going to measure these milestones, and are these things going to be transparent?\u201d he said.\n\nAmazon had the upper hand throughout the negotiation process for its new headquarters, starting with a public call for bids from cities across North America. It received 238 proposals within months, giving the company a broad view of how much cities were willing to offer in an effort to top one another.\n\n\u201cCompanies control all of the information,\" LeRoy said. \"That makes our public officials incredibly passive and helpless trying to play a fair game of poker.\"\n\nIn Foxconn's case, federal leaders including Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan privately urged the company's executives to consider a site in Wisconsin. The appeal of such arrangements for politicians is strong: Voters will view them as fighting for and delivering jobs to their state.\n\nBut the criticism heaped on the deal with Foxconn \u2014 and now Amazon \u2014 could be \"a harbinger of things to come,\" Chatterji said.\n\n\u201cI do think we\u2019ll enter an era where incentives will be under more of a microscope,\" he said, \"but at the same time companies are going to keep pushing for them.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "jwhite@politico.com (Jeremy B.

Now is not the time to point fingers,\u201d Zinke said, calling metastasizing wildfires not an exclusively state or federal matter but, \"an American issue of managing our forests,\" and noting that the soaring federal price tag for massive fires had reached $870 million.\n\n\u201cThis is a national issue, and certainly California being an economic powerhouse, very populous and influential, when something of this nature happens in California people pay attention,\u201d he said in response to a question about Trump singling out California.\n\n\"We have to work together to manage our forests,\" Zinke said, because \u201cthis is unsustainable.\u201d\n\nBrown also pointed to a multitude of factors that produced the \u201cwar zone\u201d the two had just visited, shrugging off questions about the administration's comments or the possibility that a state utility's equipment had ignited flames.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing: It\u2019s people, it\u2019s how people live, it\u2019s where they live, it\u2019s the changing climate,\u201d Brown said.\n\nTrump's previous comments blaming California\u2019s catastrophic wildfires on the state\u2019s forestry practices were sharply condemned as both inaccurate and cruel, especially as the death toll from the fire rose and emergency crews struggled to contain the flames. As of Wednesday afternoon, the death toll from the Camp Fire in northern California had reached 48, with dozens of people \u2014 many elderly \u2014 still listed as missing.\n\nTrump subsequently met California\u2019s request for federal assistance, and Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Service, lauded the federal government for being \"fully engaged with us,\" and he praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the White House.\n\nBut Wednesday's united front belied Zinke's record of echoing and amplifying Trump\u2019s criticism. In an interview with Breitbart News last year, he excoriated \u201cenvironmental terrorist groups\u201d that \u201cclose off roads, refuse to have firebreaks, refuse to have any timber harvest.\u201d\n\nAnd in a September Sacramento Bee op-ed he authored with Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, he complained that \u201c[f]or too long, our forest management efforts have been thwarted by lawsuits from misguided, extreme environmentalists. The time has come to act without flinching in the face of threatened litigation.\"\n\nWhile environmentalists, rural officials and the timber industry have long sparred over the economic and ecological impact of curtailed logging \u2014 with some challenges successfully halting or delaying harvests \u2014 there is little evidence that legal disputes have substantially increased wildfire risks. A 2010 Government Accountability Office study found that just two percent of Forest Service decisions dealing with fuel reduction were litigated.\n\n\u201cThe changing dynamic on the ground here in California is that a very large core group of environmental organizations understand that we do have to go in and thin the forests, that reducing the fuel load is important,\u201d said Rich Gordon, a former state assemblyman who leads the California Forestry Association.\n\nGordon acknowledged that California has \u201cthe strictest timber harvest rules in the world\u201d but he noted that major environmental groups backed a sweeping wildfire prevention bill this year that enables more timber-clearing and allocates $1 billion for forest management.\n\nFar more consequential than forest stewardship, forestry experts say, has been climate change\u2019s role in raising temperatures, reducing precipitation and extending a fire season that once ran from mid-summer to early fall into a year-round hazard. Scientists and state officials have repudiated Trump\u2019s faulting state mismanagement by noting that much of the state\u2019s forestland is federally managed and that the current fires have ignited in grass and chaparral.\n\n\u201cReally what we\u2019re in the middle of is a transformation of our landscape by climate change,\u201d said LeRoy Westerling, an expert on forestry and wildfire management at the University of California, Merced, whereas the federal government\u2019s response has been \u201c\u2018oh, ignore the climate change \u2014 let\u2019s just jump in there and use it as an excuse to log our last wilderness areas.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "nkorecki@politico.com (Natasha Korecki)", "title": "Avenatti in police custody following domestic dispute", "description": "Avenatti, who is in the midst of a contested divorce, has campaigned across 20 states since July.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/michael-avenatti-arrest-domestic-dispute-991268", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/40/33/4846c9574011b41a9ae9447a71ed/181114-avenatti-getty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T23:30:11Z", "content": "Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti is in police custody following a domestic dispute, the AP is reporting.

He has never been abusive to me or anyone else. He is a very good man.\u201d\n\nAvenatti, who is in the midst of a contested divorce from Lisa Storie-Avenatti, has campaigned across 20 states since July, speaking to large crowds and selling out fundraising dinners, including in Iowa. Avenatti has attempted to position himself as the Democrats\u2019 answer to Donald Trump, calling on the Democratic field to \u201chit harder\u201d against the president.\n\nOn Saturday, Avenatti revealed he represented a man who was seeking to bring charges against Fox News host Tucker Carlson after an incident in a Virginia restaurant.\n\nSince Avenatti began ramping up his 2020 ambitions, he\u2019s faced various controversies, from getting into verbal scrums with Donald Trump Jr. over Twitter to facing a backlash over comments he made, according to Time, that the person to run against Trump \u201cbetter be a white male.\u201d Avenatti said he was taken out of context, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a f------ outrage.\u201d Last month, the Senate Judiciary Committee referred Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick to the Justice Department for an investigation into false statements after she leveled sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, then a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nAvenatti also faced his share of troubles in civil court. As part of their divorce case, his second wife sought $215,643 a month in family support. And in October, a Los Angeles judge issued an order saying Avenatti must pay $4.85 million to a former law colleague who claimed he was owed millions of dollars in profit.\n\nAt the time, Avenatti told POLITICO there was nothing in his past that would rule out a potential run for president. He even launched a political PAC and released his first ad.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of things I would not have done. Do I think any of them are disqualifying?

Twenty judicial nominees are currently waiting for a vote in the Judiciary panel, in addition to another nominee still awaiting a hearing, and 32 nominees have already cleared committee but not yet gotten a floor vote.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) objected on the floor to Flake\u2019s request for a vote on the Mueller protection legislation. McConnell can seek to bring nominees straight to the floor without a favorable verdict from the Judiciary Committee \u2014 although such moves are rare. And with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie, it\u2019s possible to confirm the nominees already teed up for a floor vote without Flake\u2019s support.\n\nEven so, Flake\u2019s move raises the stakes of debate on a Mueller protection measure that cleared the Judiciary panel in April but has stalled without a floor vote as McConnell reiterates doubt that the special counsel\u2019s job is in danger. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has said he'll push for the Mueller bill to get added to spending legislation that must pass to keep the government open past Dec. 7, but it's unclear whether Democrats have enough leverage to extract that concession.\n\n\"There has to be a viable strategy, because there's enough support for protecting the special counsel that I think ... there will be a way to do it,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who added that fellow Democrats are \"still thinking through\" how best to force consideration of the bill.\n\nDemocrats appear to have their work cut out for them. Trump's ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions is perceived by many of the president\u2019s critics as a pretext to ending Mueller's probe. But it also hasn\u2019t appeared to shake the GOP consensus that the special counsel is safe to finish his investigation into Russian interference and any alleged wrongdoing by Trump.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, one of the lead Republican authors of the Mueller protection bill, said Wednesday that he didn't foresee Sessions' ouster heightening the \"threat of Mueller being prevented from finishing his business.\"\n\nAt a press conference after their floor remarks, Flake and Coons said that they would consider joining the push to add the Mueller protection bill to a must-pass spending bill. Flake acknowledged that he had less power given that Pence could break a tie during floor votes but reiterated the importance of opposing nominees in committee.\n\n\"There's such a slim margin on the floor and some members are sticklers for precedent,\" he said. \"You don't want to get in the habit of nullifying a committee action.\"\n\nFlake said that he was also speaking to fellow GOP members about taking similar actions against judicial nominees whose floor votes are pending and predicted that if the Senate votes on the bill, it will \"pass overwhelmingly.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republican also joined Coons and many other Democrats in calling for Sessions' replacement, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "dsamuelsohn@politico.com (Darren Samuelsohn)", "title": "Mueller delays sentencing for ex-Trump aide Gates over ongoing cooperation", "description": "The delay stands in contrast to two other high-profile former Trump officials&nbsp;who are moving toward sentencing in the Mueller investigation.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/rick-gates-sentencing-mueller-probe-990758", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/28/3b/ea6a3e68439aa79f7715b8f6312f/181114-gates-getty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:23:32Z", "content": "To some expert observers, movement toward sentencing of former Trump Deputy Campaign Manager Rick Gates is a sign that special counsel Robert Muellers probe is nearing an end. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Special counsel Robert Mueller again pushed b\u2026 [+2815 chars]", "fulltext": "To some expert observers, movement toward sentencing of former Trump Deputy Campaign Manager Rick Gates is a sign that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe is nearing an end. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Legal Mueller delays sentencing for ex-Trump aide Gates over ongoing cooperation The delay stands in contrast to two other high-profile former Trump officials who are moving toward sentencing in the Mueller investigation.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller again pushed back the sentencing of former Donald Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates because the longtime GOP operative is still cooperating on \"several ongoing investigations.\"\n\nThe delay, laid out in a new one-page joint filing , stands in contrast to two other high-profile former Trump officials \u2014 Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort \u2014 who are moving toward sentencing after also pleading guilty and cooperating with the special counsel\u2019s probe.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut in a Wednesday memo filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit, attorneys for Mueller and Gates confirmed that Gates \u201ccontinues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations, and accordingly the parties do not believe it is appropriate to commence the sentencing process at this time.\u201d\n\nBoth sides agreed to give the court another update by January 15 on his cooperation and whether they\u2019re ready to move toward sentencing for Gates, who pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy against the U.S. and making a false statement in a federal investigation.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Chris Christie, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, said Wednesday he has not been contacted by the White House about the possibility of being nominated for attorney general.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Christie told reporters after an event in Atlantic City, according to audio of the exchange. \u201cNo, I read the papers. I know the position\u2019s open. No one needs to tell me.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nChristie is reportedly under serious consideration for the position in the wake of Jeff Sessions' forced resignation. Christie has been clear in the past that he desires the job and has turned down other cabinet positions.\n\nThe Republican, who left office in January after hitting a two-term limit, is now an attorney in private practice and a political analyst for ABC News. He has moved toward the front of the line for the attorney general job since Sessions was pushed out after it became clear several other potential nominees were not interested in the position.\n\nPOLITICO reported last week that Trump has said privately he believes Christie, the first prominent Republican to back his presidential bid, has patiently waited his turn after being passed over for the job during the post-2016 election transition.\n\nChristie played coy when asked if he would accept the nomination if asked.\n\n\u201cListen, the only person I owe that answer to is the president of the United States if the question is asked and, if he asks, I\u2019ll answer like I always do,\u201d Christie said.\n\nA former U.S. attorney who ran a losing campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, Christie said he had \u201cbeen through this dance before,\u201d noting he was considered for the vice presidency in 2012 and 2016, and \u201cfor a whole bunch of different positions in this administration.\u201d\n\nHe also chaired Trump's transition team before 2016 election, but was removed from that role within days of the president's victory. Still, he has remained close to Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing more to say about it. I love my life the way I have it right now. I\u2019m more relaxed than I\u2019ve been in 16 years,\u201d Christie said, noting he has a lot of time to spend with his wife, Mary Pat.\n\nBut he also said, \u201cI love my country and I\u2019ve always been willing to serve.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever say \u2018never\u2019 to a president,\u201d Christie said. \u201cIf a president calls, you take the call and you listen. If it works for you, you say, \u2018yes.\u2019 If it doesn\u2019t work for you, you say, \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe attorney general post opened a week ago after Sessions submitted his resignation at the president's request. Trump has appointed Sessions' chief of staff, Matt Whitaker, to take the job on an acting basis.\n\nWhomever replaces Sessions permanently will inherit oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into 2016 Russian election interference. Trump has called the investigation a \"witch hunt\" and has indicated he wants an attorney general who will carry out his wishes as it relates to the probe, while Democrats say he has sought to obstruct the investigation by pressuring senior Justice Department officials.\n\nChristie, like Sessions, could be conflicted, given his role on the transition team. And while many observers say there are few people better qualified to manage the Mueller probe to Trumps\u2019 liking, the former governor has taken pains to defend the special counsel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always found Bob Mueller to be a person of integrity and honesty, and a hard worker,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd I think he deserves great credit for the fact there\u2019s really almost no leaking out of that operation. As somebody who was U.S. attorney for seven years, I know that takes leadership from the top to make sure you don\u2019t have leaking \u2014 especially something as high-profile as this. So I think Bob deserves credit for all those things.\u201d\n\nChristie said he previously \u201ccautioned\u201d that special counsel inquires tend to take a long time and \u201cwind up going to areas that are beyond their scope,\u201d which he says Mueller has done.\n\n\u201cThere are dangers with it, but that would be true no matter whom you put in as special counsel, I imagine, and not because of Bob,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI have not changed my view about Mueller at all.

Bill Nelson has flooded the Florida courts with lawsuits, claiming that his Senate race against Gov. Rick Scott has been marred by an unfair treatment of absentee ballot mail-in deadlines and signature mismatches, among a host of other issues.\n\nBut experts say Nelson faces long odds in his bid to flip the results in the race, with Scott leading by 12,652 votes heading into the contest's automatic recount, which ends Thursday and will likely lead to a manual recount next.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNelson has two major problems, experts say: Nelson's lawsuits were filed so late and courts generally frown on last-minute post-election changes, and the margin he trails Scott by is so big that even expanding the pool of available ballots to count makes it highly unlikely that Nelson could make up enough ground.\n\n\u201cA royal flush is right on the money.

And even then, it would not seem to be enough to change the outcome,\u201d Morley said. \u201cOne study that I\u2019ve seen shows that in the 21st Century, there have only been three statewide races that have had their results changed as a result of a recount. And in each of those races, the margins were in the hundreds, not more than 12,000.\u201d\n\nAs of the most recent update, only 7,871 absentee ballots were rejected statewide due to \u201cvoter error,\u201d which could include mismatched signatures on the ballots compared with what\u2019s on file with the state. And of them, 35 percent were cast by Republicans, 36 percent by Democrats and 29 percent by independents. Another 10,186 ballots were rejected because their envelopes were unsigned. Of them, 31 percent were cast by Republicans, 44 percent by Democrats and 24 percent by independents.\n\nSo if all those ballots were counted, Nelson would have to win 85 percent of them statewide in an election where he couldn\u2019t get 50 percent of the vote so far.\n\nOn Wednesday, the state\u2019s elections division director provided more specificity when she testified in Nelson\u2019s signature mismatch suit by revealing that 3,688 mail-in absentee ballots and another 93 provisional ballots were rejected for mismatches by 45 counties, a count that didn\u2019t include the large counties of Miami-Dade or Duval.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rabbit out of a hat. But there\u2019s not enough rabbit,\u201d one Republican lawyer involved in the recount who spoke to POLITICO on the condition of anonymity said of Nelson\u2019s strategy and predicament.\n\nThe lawsuit over mismatched signatures for absentee ballots was heard Wednesday in federal court in Tallahassee. Nelson\u2019s campaign has also sued over deadlines for the receipt of absentee ballots, standards for divining voter intent and the deadline to finish the recount.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many ballots would be counted if Nelson\u2019s lawsuits prevail. For instance, many county election supervisors have not logged absentee ballots that arrived after 7 p.m. on Election Day but were postmarked on Election Day.\n\nThe volume of those lawsuits might also pose a problem for Nelson because it just might be too much, Morley said, noting that \u201cthe more you\u2019re challenging, the more you\u2019re asking the court to do, and the greater burden you\u2019re bringing on yourself.\u201d\n\nMorley, Ohio State University election law professor Ned Foley and University of California election law professor Rick Hasen all indicated that the strongest defense for the state \u2014 which Nelson\u2019s campaign and various Democrats are suing \u2014 rests in the timing issue of lawsuits that are simply filed too late, a principle enshrined in a legal principle against \u201clegal ambush\u201d called \u201claches.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the law professors who believe suits brought after Election Day are problematic. Nelson\u2019s lead attorney in his cases, Marc Elias, has specifically cited laches and Purcell to argue against a late-filed lawsuit concerning signature mismatches \u2014 however that case was in the Arizona Senate race, where the Democrat was ahead and therefore wanted no more ballots to be counted.\n\nElias and a co-counsel for the Arizona Democratic Party noted in a legal brief that some Arizona counties allow voters to address signature mismatches on early ballots they\u2019ve submitted up to five business days before Election Day but that the Arizona lawsuit wasn\u2019t filed until after the election and voters had no more chance to fix the anomalies.\n\nScott\u2019s campaign noted the discrepancy in a written statement.\n\n\u201cTo put it simply, Democrats in Arizona are using the opposite and contradictory argument to the one they plan to use in court tomorrow in Tallahassee,\u201d the Scott campaign said Tuesday. \u201cFor them, this isn\u2019t about following the law, and it isn\u2019t about having a free and fair election. This is about getting rid of Florida laws they don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nNelson's campaign has said he just wants every vote counted.\n\n\u201cGiven the closeness of this election, and the fact that the courts have declared signature-matching laws unconstitutional in several states, we expect this issue to be of considerable importance here in Florida,\" Nelson said in a written statement. \"So I ask each of you \u2014 just consider whether or not you would want your ballot thrown out by an untrained, even though well-intentioned, election worker or a volunteer, all because he or she determined that your signature doesn't look right.\"\n\nHasen, who blogs about election law while teaching at U.C. Irvine, said in a post about Nelson\u2019s suits that he\u2019s \u201csympathetic to the arguments in general, given my belief that election statutes, when possible should be interpreted to enfranchise voters. But Florida laws were rewritten after the 2000 Bush v. Gore debacle to deal with giving too much discretion to election officials to decide on what counts as a valid vote, and rules that are clear in advance are the best for fair election administration.\u201d\n\nThe Senate race had a significant number of undervotes compared to the governor\u2019s race, which is also being recounted, in problematic Broward County.\n\nThe undervotes \u2014 which happen where no one chooses a candidate in a race \u2014 are to be analyzed manually if at the end of the machine recount the margin in the race remains within a quarter percentage point. The Senate margin was 0.153 points at the start of the machine recount in a race where nearly 8.2 million votes were cast. County canvassing officials will also examine overvotes, in which more than one candidate was chosen.\n\nNelson is challenging the standards by which voter intent is divined in recounts.\n\nBroward, a large Democratic-heavy county, had a notably large undervote in the Senate race, marking the first time that fewer people in the county voted for Senate when compared to all other down-ballot statewide races. Nelson\u2019s campaign is holding out hope that the undervote was a result of machine error or difficulty in reading ballots. But even if the Senate race in Broward got the same total votes as the gubernatorial contest, Nelson would have to win the additional pool of 26,105 votes by a 50-point margin in a county that he carried by 38 points.\n\nBut experts, including Democratic data analyst Matt Isbell, caution that most undervotes in the county won\u2019t count anyway because they\u2019re more likely the result of bad ballot design; the Senate race was tucked just below the voting instructions in the left hand corner of the page and many voters likely didn\u2019t see it. If that\u2019s the case and voters just missed voting in the race, Florida law does not expressly allow officials to guess at the voter\u2019s choice. And so Nelson could lose a major chance to make up ground.\n\nStill, the results of the automatic recount are likely to change the margins in the race \u2014 though the degree is unclear \u2014 and the manual recount should change it more.\n\nAnd that makes the changing of the law so crucial to Nelson to expand the pool of available votes.\n\nBut Ohio State\u2019s Foley said that yet another case, Roe v. Alabama, by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 which oversees Florida \u2014 espoused a principle that \u201cballots must be counted according to the rules for counting ballots at the time those ballots were cast. So even though it\u2019s not the most desirable rule for counting ballots, you can\u2019t change counting rules in the middle of the election itself.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, there\u2019s a general legal principle that voters\u2019 rights to have their ballots counted fairly pervades all election law and that the facts of the cases brought by Nelson will dictate their outcome.\n\nMorley, the FSU professor, said that in the unlikely event Nelson can \u201crun the table\u201d in court, he just can\u2019t see how the Democrat could pull ahead.\n\n\u201cWhere are the votes going to come from?\u201d he said."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Burgess Everett", "title": "Sinema: I would have considered 'new leadership' if Schumer had a challenger", "description": "She said while campaigning in July that she would vote against Schumer for minority leader.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/sinema-schumer-challenger-990745", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/dd/c0/1b277f4546d2a5768bce5e564ad8/181114-sinema-schumer-gty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:49:54Z", "content": "Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema told POLITICO while campaigning in July that she would vote against Chuck Schumer for minority leader. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) said Wednesday that she would have considered voting for someone ot\u2026 [+751 chars]", "fulltext": "Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema told POLITICO while campaigning in July that she would vote against Chuck Schumer for minority leader. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Congress Sinema: I would have considered 'new leadership' if Schumer had a challenger\n\nSen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) said Wednesday that she would have considered voting for someone other than Sen.

As POLITICO has reported, Ricardel has also run afoul of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who blocked her from landing a Pentagon job last year, as well as other Trump officials.\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t a lot of people fighting for her,\u201d one administration official said.\n\nRicardel, who served at the State Department and Defense Department in two prior Republican administrations, is a former Boeing executive who advised the Trump campaign and post-election transition. She was hired by national security adviser John Bolton shortly after Trump appointed him in April. (Bolton is the third person to hold that post in less than two years \u2014 the same number Barack Obama had during his eight-year presidency. George W. Bush had just two national security advisers over two terms.)\n\nIn her statement Wednesday, Sanders added that the president \"is grateful for Ms. Ricardel\u2019s continued service to the American people and her steadfast pursuit of his national security priorities.\"\n\nThe first lady\u2019s anger stemmed from a dust-up between Ricardel and the East Wing over an October trip to Africa, when Ricardel allegedly threatened to undermine the trip after learning she didn\u2019t have a seat on the plane. Melania Trump\u2019s staff also came to suspect that Ricardel was responsible for unflattering stories about the first lady, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMelania Trump and her team had been privately pushing for Ricardel\u2019s ouster for weeks before deciding to go public on Tuesday. But Bolton defended his top aide and refused to fire her, according to two administration officials. The decision came while Bolton, Ricardel's strongest defender, was in Singapore for a key international summit.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the president\u2019s wife issued a statement through her official spokeswoman that said, \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\u201d Melania Trump had personally approved the statement, aides said.\n\nWest Wing aides were alerted to the upcoming statement just moments before it was sent to reporters, according to the administration officials.\n\nThe Tuesday statement reflected exasperation on the part of Melania Trump and her staff, who had told Trump\u2019s top West Wing aides that they were unhappy with Ricardel, who held what has traditionally been one of the government's most sensitive jobs, coordinating advice on national security issues from multiple departments and agencies. The two administration officials said chief of staff John Kelly had repeatedly pushed Bolton to fire Ricardel.\n\nKelly and Bolton have clashed behind the scenes before. The chief of staff erupted in anger and obscenities last month when Bolton criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Kelly\u2019s closest ally in the administration.\n\nAs head of the Defense Department\u2019s transition team after the 2016 election, Ricardel clashed with Mattis over personnel issues. She also butted heads with officials at the Department of Homeland Security, according to an administration official.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty well known that she\u2019s hard to work with,\u201d said the official. \u201cIt\u2019s been just a rocky relationship. She\u2019s confrontational.\"\n\nThe first lady indicated in an interview during her October trip to Africa that she had expressed concerns in the past about certain White House staffers to her husband, though not all of them had been removed from their jobs.\n\nAsked by ABC News\u2019 Tom Llamas whether she had relayed to Trump which staffers she didn\u2019t trust, the first lady responded that she \u201cgave him my honest advice.\u201d Asked what Trump did with her advice, she responded that \u201csome people, they don\u2019t work there anymore.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, aides to the first lady said privately earlier Wednesday they had done all they could to oust Ricardel. The decision was now in the hands of the president and his top advisers, the aides said, adding that they didn't intend to say anything more on the subject publicly.\n\n\u201cShe is strong and independent and when she feels something needs to be said, she says it,\u201d one White House official said of the first lady. \u201cMrs. Trump always does what she feels is right with no regard to what people will think of her \u2014 this should be celebrated, not considered any kind of slight towards her husband.\u201d\n\nMelania Trump's small, tight-knit group of a dozen East Wing staffers operates largely independently from the West Wing. The first lady values that independence, according to people close to her, and she chafes at any perceived efforts to control her.\n\nAmid a national uproar in June over a Trump administration policy \u2014 personally defended by her husband \u2014 that separated children from parents crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, the president\u2019s wife issued another statement that seemed to broadcast frustration with the White House.\n\n\u201cMrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,\" her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said. \"She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.\"\n\nIn a statement after Ricardel's hiring earlier this year, Bolton lavished praise on his new deputy.\n\n\u201cMira Ricardel has a track record of successfully managing teams and diverse organizations, as well as addressing complex issues,\u201d Bolton said.\n\n\u201cI selected her as Deputy National Security Advisor because her expertise is broad-based and includes national security matters related to our alliances, defense posture, technology security, foreign security assistance, and arms control.

Back then, McCarthy was running for speaker but ran into opposition from the Freedom Caucus and withdrew his name from consideration. That cleared the way for Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to become speaker.\n\nRyan announced in April he would retire from the House; amid intense jockeying behind the scenes to replace him, McCarthy consistently remained the front-runner.\n\nHouse Republicans also filled out the rest of their leadership team for the new Congress with few surprises.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana will be minority whip, and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming \u2014 a rising star in the party and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney \u2014 will be Republican Conference chairwoman. Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina will be vice chair and Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota will chair the National Republican Campaign Committee. Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama will lead the Republican Policy Committee. Palmer is the first member of the Freedom Caucus to capture a leadership role.\n\nFollowing McCarthy's comments, Cheney gave a nod to the GOP's struggles among women and minorities. She insisted that Republicans would \"take a back seat to no one\" when it comes to \"doing what's right for America's women, America's minorities.\"\n\nMcCarthy also acknowledged Republicans' struggles in the suburbs.\n\n\"We took a beating inside the suburban areas,\" he said, adding, \"Our ideas are going to have to be stronger.\"\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s victory is a bittersweet one, coming as Republicans prepare to hand the speaker's gavel back to Democrats for the first time in eight years.\n\nDragged down by history and Trump\u2019s dismal poll numbers, Democrats enjoyed their biggest House victory since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s. Democrats are on track to gain 35 to 40 seats, including a slew in McCarthy\u2019s home state of California, where an already small number of Republican House members saw their ranks shrink dramatically.\n\nMcCarthy didn't mention Trump in his remarks after the leadership elections, instead alluding to him only when asked about the reason for GOP losses. He criticized Democrats for what he said seemed to be a plan to impeach the president, though Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has rebuffed the notion. He also sidestepped a question about whether Trump's unpopularity and divisive rhetoric hurt Republicans in the elections \u2014 saying only that presidents nearly always see their party lose seats in the midterms.\n\nIn McCarthy's pitch to the GOP Conference, multiple members said the Californian touted his role in recapturing the House from Democrats back in 2010 \u2014 a feat Republicans are now solely focused on repeating.\n\n\u201cI think the consensus was, he could unify us. He helped us win back the majority from Nancy Pelosi once, and we believe he can do it again,\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told reporters.\n\nMultiple GOP veterans left Wednesday\u2019s meeting visibly energized and ready to spar with Democratic leaders.\n\n\u201cWe know the Democrats\u2019 base is going to be pushing them toward investigations and impeachments ad nauseam, probably Cabinet officials, maybe a Supreme Court justice, certainly a president,\u201d said Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), a longtime lawmaker who helped lead the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. \u201cWhen they overreach, which I\u2019m sure they will, then I think we should push back and we should push back aggressively,\u201d added Chabot, who is running for the top GOP spot on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nMcCarthy was nominated for the post by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, (R-Texas); Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Brian Mast (R-Fla.) also spoke in favor.\n\nThe California Republican will still have to deal with Jordan, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and other House conservatives who have made headaches for GOP leaders over the years.\n\nPOLITICO reported Tuesday night that Trump urged McCarthy to \u201cmake everybody happy\u201d in regard to Jordan, who wants to be ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. However, Jordan is not popular with other House Republicans and may not be able to jump over more senior lawmakers for the Judiciary post.\n\nIn his remarks, McCarthy thanked Jordan for running against him but gave little indication of what he expects Jordan's role to be in the next Congress.\n\nMeadows told reporters that he thinks Jordan has earned a look to lead Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, a role that would make him Trump's most prominent defender in any impeachment probe.\n\nJordan left the vote without speaking to reporters, but Meadows said Jordan was \"gratified\" to receive the 43 votes he got.

Congress must fund a quarter of the government by Dec. 7 and McConnell also wants to finish the long-stalled farm bill before year's end.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a whip count and see where we stand.

In addition to Cotton\u2019s scorched-earth campaign against the bill, Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana has criticized his state\u2019s Democratic governor for pursuing criminal justice reform there while weighing his own run for the office.\n\n\u201cPut me down as doubtful\u201d about the agreement's prospects, Kennedy said earlier Wednesday, before Trump's thumbs-up.\n\nThe criminal justice package adds four provisions changing federal sentencing to a prisons bill that passed the House with more than 130 Democratic votes in May. Among those negotiated sentencing changes are lower mandatory minimums for drug-related offenses and the addition of retroactivity to a 2010 law that closed the sentencing disparity for crack and cocaine offenses.\n\nThe addition of those sentencing changes makes for a more substantive measure than the narrow House-passed prisons effort, which Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn has sponsored in the Senate. Groups supporting the effort are counting on Trump's endorsement to help push the deal across the finish line with Republicans, particularly those from deep-red states where the president remains extremely popular.\n\nTrump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, is leading the internal White House efforts in favor of the agreement. The president praised Kushner during Wednesday\u2019s White House event. \u201cHe worked very hard and he feels very deeply about it,\u201d Trump said of his son-in law.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who have taken a leading role in their respective parties in negotiating on the criminal justice package, hailed Trump's remarks Wednesday in a statement that referred to McConnell's vow earlier this year to take up the criminal justice deal if it could win at least 60 votes.\n\n\"With the president\u2019s support and Leader McConnell\u2019s pledge to hold a vote on the broadly popular package, we can quickly take a critical first step towards reforming our criminal justice system,\" Grassley and Durbin said.\n\nThe White House has been in regular contact with McConnell\u2019s office about finding floor time for the bill. A White House official said Trump administration aides initially hoped to move the bill before the election, but McConnell decided to wait until after it was over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. There are other things that will compete for time on the floor. But I am optimistic that we will clear over 60 votes,\u201d the official said, adding later, \u201cOur goal is to try to get it done as quickly as possible. \u2026 We\u2019re going to push very hard to see if we can bring it home.\u201d\n\nKushner spoke with Cotton on Wednesday ahead of Trump\u2019s endorsement announcement, the White House official said, adding that aides will continue to talk to him. \u201cWe welcome his feedback, but again he\u2019s one vote,\u201d the official said before expressing some hope that the White House can allay some of Cotton\u2019s concerns. \u201cI\u2019d like to figure out to what degree we can get him on board, if that\u2019s possible,\u201d the official said.\n\nAnd one of the measure's most influential backers, Sen. Paul, is joined in his criminal justice advocacy efforts by his wife, Kelley, who visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday to help rally support for the legislation.\n\n\"It would be so important right now, especially in this time of incredible division, to have a bipartisan bill pass that helps people from all walks of life,\" Kelley Paul said in an interview after meeting with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how comprehensive Democratic support is for the package. Some in the party may believe that a Democratic House takeover next year could lead to a better outcome for the left by nudging the GOP to the table on stronger sentencing reform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in favor of comprehensive criminal justice reform. My only question is, is this big enough?\u201d asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), like Warren a potential 2020 presidential contender for his party, on Wednesday declined to weigh in on where he stands on the measure, saying that he's \"in a lot of conversations about the bill right now.\"\n\nSen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of GOP leadership, said he supports the effort but gave a yellow light to its prospects for quick movement.

Florida Senate recount set to get first day in federal court\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Florida\u2019s seemingly never-ending midterm recount saga turns to federal court Wednesday where Sen. Bill Nelson\u2019s uphill fight to stay in office hinges largely on an effort to overturn a state law that could free up \u201cthousands\u201d of additional votes.\n\nThe lawsuit centers on whether a state law requiring that signatures on mail and provisional ballots match those on file with election offices but has expanded beyond a fight over Florida statutes into a fight involving national political groups, former Congress members and the state\u2019s top law enforcement officer.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe legal fight, which will play out this afternoon in Judge Mark Walker\u2019s downtown Tallahassee courtroom, was originally filed by Nelson and the Florida Democratic Party against Secretary of State Ken Detzner, who is the Scott administration\u2019s top election official. Gov. Rick Scott is Nelson\u2019s Republican opponent in Florida\u2019s U.S. Senate race, one of three statewide races in the Sunshine State that is being recounted.\n\nThere is initially a Thursday deadline for counties to finish a machine recount, which also involves Florida\u2019s governor\u2019s race, but there are legal challenges seeking to extend that time frame. Any race that is within .25 percent after the machine recount, whenever it concludes, would then go to a hand recount under Florida law. That could go on for weeks.\n\nAmong the reams of motions filed since the legal challenge was first made public last week are motions to intervene from Republican Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, a Washington-based group that helped Scott\u2018s 2018 Senate campaign against Nelson.\n\n\u201cThe NRSC\u2019s interest is to assure that Florida\u2019s election laws are followed and not rewritten to the prejudice of Scott\u2019s candidacy,\u201d read the NRSC\u2019s motion to intervene, which was granted.\n\nAlong with Florida-based attorney Andy Bardos with the law firm Gray Robinson, the NRSC filing includes attorney Helgi Walker and Thomas Dupree of the Washington-based law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. The firm\u2019s location is notable because Scott and other Republicans have been hammering Nelson for hiring a \u201cDC lawyer.\u201d His campaign is represented by well-known Democratic election law attorney Marc Elias, who is from the Washington office of Perkins Coie.\n\nElias told reporters that he thought that if the signature match lawsuit was successful, it could \u201cadd thousands of additional ballots that have so far gone uncounted.\u201d That sentiment is at the heart of the simmering partisan fight: Democrats say the Florida law is disenfranchises voters, while Republicans charge that Nelson is trying to change laws through the court after losing an election.\n\nOn the other side, former Democratic Congressman Patrick Murphy has filed an affidavit in support of Nelson. He said publicly last week that his vote-by-mail ballot was rejected because his signature did not match the one that was on file. Florida allows people who have voted by mail to check online to see whether their ballots were accepted. Murphy said in his affidavit that he was \u201csurprised\u201d because he had no problem voting by mail during the August primary.\n\nAhead of the hearing Wednesday, Scott general counsel Dan Nordby told the court that Scott would recuse himself from the Florida Election Canvasing Committee, which is the board that formally signs off on election results. Scott is up by a razor-thin 12,000 vote margin over Nelson in a race that could go to a hand recount, so there had been an open question about whether Scott would continue to play a role in overseeing the election process.\n\nHe had faced pressure from outside groups, including the League of Women Voters of Florida, to recuse himself, but had been silent on the issue until Wednesday morning. He made a similar decision in 2014 when running for reelection.\n\nOn the vote counting front, Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher made waves Tuesday night after telling WPBF television in Palm Beach County that their aged vote counting machines were failing and all 179,000 early votes would need to be recounted.\n\nA Leon County court ruled Tuesday night that the Palm Beach County recount effort should get five days beyond the original Thursday deadline to finish a machine recount, but that ruling was halted by a last-minute move by the state sending it to federal court.\n\nThose recount deadlines are also the subject of another one of the lawsuits filed either by Nelson or Democratic groups. His campaign says that the Thursday deadline for county voters to finish their machine recounts is an arbitrary deadline. If counties don\u2019t meet that deadline, election night results could be used under state law, which Elias argued could disenfranchise untold thousands of voters. Scott led Nelson in the Senate race under initial counts.\n\nOther lawsuits filed by Democrats include a challenge to the state\u2019s vote-by-mail ballot deadlines. The Nelson camp wants state law to include mail ballots that were postmarked before election day which is when they are due, but were not delivered in time through no fault of the voter. On Thursday, Nelson also filed a lawsuit against Bay County over that county\u2019s election chief Mark Andersen not turning over public records quick enough. The Nelson camp was seeking records related to Anderson\u2019s admission that the northwest Florida county, which was devastated by Hurricane Michael, accepted some votes by mail and fax, which is not allowed by state law.\n\nThe onslaught of lawsuits after Election Day have fueled Republicans\u2018 most prominent post-election day talking-point: Nelson wants the courts, not voters, to send him back to the Senate for a fourth term. That was highlighted by veteran GOP election law attorney Charlie Spies during a Wednesday morning CNN interview.\n\n\u201cThis is all trying to change the rules after the fact,\u201d he said."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "aisenstadt@politico.com (Alex Isenstadt)", "title": "Trump weighs Mississippi visit on heels of Hyde-Smith 'hanging' remark", "description": "A video released last weekend showed Sen.

Much of the funding came from an approximately $1 million transfer supplied from the Republican National Committee last week, before Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks became public.\n\nThe RNC, which deployed field staffers nationwide ahead of the midterm elections, has had two dozen aides in Mississippi for months, and plans on deploying additional staffers from other states.\n\nParty officials say they remain confident that Hyde-Smith will prevail in the deep red state but want to take no chances, particularly after last year\u2019s embarrassing special election loss for an Alabama Senate seat.\n\nAdditional reinforcements could be on the way. Mississippi Victory Fund, a pro-Hyde Smith super PAC, is expected to invest another $600,000 ahead of the runoff. The group, which is run by Henry Barbour, the nephew of former Gov. Haley Barbour, had spent more than $300,000 through the middle of October, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nNational Democrats, who've long viewed the contest as a reach, are also starting to engage. On Wednesday, the Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC began reserving TV advertising time. The group's commercials are set to begin airing later this week, a spokesman confirmed.\n\nAnd this weekend, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is African American, is slated to campaign with Espy,\n\nHyde-Smith's \"hanging\" remark triggered an outcry, with many pointing to Mississippi's history of lynchings. Nearly 40 percent of the state's population is African-American.\n\nBut Hyde-Smith denied any racial intent.\n\n\"In a comment on Nov. 2, I referred to accepting an invitation to a speaking engagement. In referencing the one who invited me, I used an exaggerated expression of regard, and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous,\u201d Hyde-Smith said in a statement last weekend. She has refused to elaborate.\n\nWhite House officials were initially disappointed by Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant's decision in March to appoint Hyde-Smith to the seat and warned him that Hyde-Smith's past Democratic affiliation would jeopardize the seat. But the administration soon came around: Trump announced his support for Hyde-Smith in August and flew to Mississippi in October to campaign for her.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "jbresnahan@politico.com (John Bresnahan)", "title": "White House looks to jam Democrats on border cash", "description": "Trump officials are urging GOP lawmakers to take a hard line in government funding negotiations.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/white-house-democrats-border-cash-990556", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/f9/b9/8955ccb14ea58adbf8a2f9e6cf81/181114-shahira-knight-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:57:00Z", "content": "Shahira Knight, President Donald Trumps top Hill aide, told a private gathering this week that Republicans should draft one giant spending package in the lame-duck Congress that includes wall funding. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik White House officials are pushing\u2026 [+1893 chars]", "fulltext": "Shahira Knight, President Donald Trump\u2019s top Hill aide, told a private gathering this week that Republicans should draft one giant spending package in the lame-duck Congress that includes wall funding. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik White House White House looks to jam Democrats on border cash\n\nWhite House officials are pushing Capitol Hill Republicans to take an all-or-nothing approach to government funding this fall \u2014 daring Democrats to shut down the government rather than fund the border wall.\n\nShahira Knight, President Donald Trump\u2019s top Hill aide, told a private gathering this week that Republicans should draft one giant spending package in the lame-duck Congress that includes wall funding, according to two sources familiar with the conversations.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat package would also include emergency dollars for this year\u2019s deadly wildfires and hurricanes, according to a senior GOP aide.

Pelosi huddled with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and put out a press release promising to work with it on reforms to decentralize power to rank-and-file members. She also met with the Congressional Black Caucus, whose leader, Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), recently floated the idea of having a CBC member challenge her or Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) for the No. 1 or No. 2 position.\n\n\"She\u2019s been very active,\" Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), a CBC member, said before Fudge revealed she might run for speaker. \"I don\u2019t know where [Pelosi] gets the energy to do all that she\u2019s done. I\u2019m curious as to who thinks that they can rival her. So I\u2019ll be very eager to see who this shadow candidate is.\u201d\n\nThe Pelosi debate also spilled into a Wednesday afternoon caucus meeting, when Democrats discussed the rules changes that Pelosi's critics are seeking. Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), who opposes Pelosi for speaker, stood to advocate for a proposal that would allow members to vote for whomever they want on the House floor for speaker.\n\nDemocrats are currently bound by caucus rules to vote for whomever wins the nomination for speaker. The nominee is decided behind closed doors in a secret ballot vote, and requires only a simple majority of members to clinch. It's a much lower threshold than is needed on the House floor, where a small number of Democrats could conceivably block Pelosi.\n\nPulling out a copy of the Constitution, Perlmutter argued that such rules go against founding principles of the nation.\n\nBut Rep.-elect Katie Hill of California challenged Perlmutter on why the rule needs to be changed, since it's not enforced anyway. She suggested that Perlmutter was raising the issue to make hay. \"On behalf of the freshman class, I would like for all of us to move forward,\" she said, according to sources in the room.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) then stood to tell the incoming freshmen \u2014 and the rest of the caucus \u2014 that it didn't matter whom they support for speaker \u2014 Republicans will attack them in the next election regardless.\n\nPelosi's critics, meanwhile, have been trying to buck up the incoming freshmen who are considering voting against Pelosi. Rep. Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat who opposed the Californian on the House floor last year, seethed at the suggestion that incoming freshmen would get in trouble for not backing Pelosi on the House floor should she win the nomination in caucus, which is almost certain.\n\n\"The untenable situation that we are giving all of these new members is saying you either violate the caucus rule and they try to make it seem like there is a consequence to that \u2014 there isn\u2019t\u2026 nothing happened to me \u2014 or you keep your campaign promise,\u201d Rice told reporters.\n\nRice also complained about Pelosi allies trying to frame her bid to reclaim the gavel as an issue of women's empowerment and gender. Pelosi allies have singled out newly elected women, especially, in their pitch to keep a woman in power, according to multiple sources familiar with their efforts.\n\n\u201cThey should not be made to feel that they are \u2018anti-women\u2019 if they don\u2019t want to vote for Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Rice said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to put all the incoming women in that position, where you\u2019re telling them if you\u2019re not going to support her, you\u2019re basically betraying your gender. That\u2019s just not true. \u2026 They should be treated with more respect.\u201d\n\nA challenge to Pelosi by Fudge would complicate the current leader's pitch to members that they need to keep a woman in power. Fudge could also give lawmakers currently on the fence about Pelosi more comfort voting against her. Currently, rebels have offered no alternative to Pelosi, which has undercut their sway with some members.\n\nThe 66-year-old Fudge was first elected to Congress in 2008. She did stints as a local politician and prosecutor before coming to Capitol Hill. She is regarded in Congress as a tough and smart lawmaker.\n\nWhile Fudge has been mentioned as potential speaker material, she supported fellow Ohioan Ryan for minority leader over Pelosi in 2016. She has also talked up South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American lawmaker in Congress, for the top post.\n\nThe entire Pelosi debate is clearly making some freshmen uncomfortable. Reps.-Elect Elissa Slotkin and Abigail Spanberger exited the caucus meeting together and bemoaned the constant questions and calls and texts about Pelosi. Jennifer Wexton, who beat Virginia Republican Barbara Comstock last week, repeatedly dodged questions from reporters about how she'd vote on Pelosi, only to later tweet her support for the leader.\n\n\"I look forward to talking to my colleagues in caucus about that,\" she told reporters. \"I know that Leader Pelosi has been the leader for many, many years and has accomplished many, many things.\"\n\nRep.-elect Susan Wild of Pennsylvania \u2014 who said she's been receiving a regular stream of texts, emails and phone calls from people regarding leadership elections \u2014 said it's important that top Democrats lay out a plan of succession before members vote. Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn are all in their 70s and have been leading the caucus for more than 15 years.\n\n\"I think it\u2018s very important that there be a succession plan in place if [Pelosi] is elected so that we are grooming people for leadership who are as diverse as this incoming freshman class is,\" Wild said.\n\nPelosi this week has been deploying all her political power to lobby incoming lawmakers for support \u2014 tapping outside groups with deep pockets and Democratic leaders from John Kerry and Al Gore to governors of their respective states to make her case.\n\nOn Wednesday, a swath of labor groups endorsed Pelosi, adding their names to a long list of women's groups, progressive groups and other organizations that have joined Pelosi's show-of-force pressure campaign. Her allies in Congress have been sending around letters to colleagues and disseminated press releases backing her as well.\n\nPelosi's critics have been trying to persuade many incoming freshmen to stick to their campaign promises to vote for new leadership, a commitment they made after being attacked by Republicans as being \u201cPelosi puppets.\" They hope to release the letter signed by those committed to voting against her on the floor, showing that they have the numbers to take Pelosi out and usher in an alternative.\n\nBut Pelosi allies have convinced several incoming freshmen not to sign on to the rebels' letter, cautioning them that such antics could land them in trouble with leadership and start them off on the wrong foot.\n\nStill, the margin for Pelosi could be close.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a\" slam dunk for Pelosi, said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). \"The math is what it is.

But the arguments Wednesday represented a significant escalation in Trump\u2019s fight against the media, with more than a dozen news organizations, including POLITICO, weighing in on CNN\u2019s side.\n\nTrump has long argued that coverage of his administration is unfair, and CNN has been a favorite target. Even before he took office, the president referred to Acosta as \u201cfake news\u201d at a press conference and refused to take questions from him. The White House also has substantially curtailed the number of briefings by press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nBut reporters have retained access to the White House and traveled with the president, and before last week, revoking a journalist\u2019s hard pass \u2014 the badge that lets them enter and exit the complex freely \u2014 was virtually unheard-of.\n\nThe White House said last Wednesday it was pulling Acosta\u2019s access after he repeatedly tried to ask Trump questions at a press conference, even after the president dismissed him, and briefly refused to let a White House aide pull a microphone out of his hand. CNN on Tuesday asked a judge to temporarily restore Acosta's credentials and declare that the administration's actions were unconstitutional, saying Trump was punishing the network for its coverage of him and not for any action on Acosta\u2019s part.\n\nTed Boutrous of Gibson and Dunn, who represented CNN and Acosta, said Wednesday that the White House\u2019s decision was \u201cpart of a campaign\u201d against Acosta, citing previous tweets and incidents in which Trump had insulted the reporter. He said under the White House\u2019s logic, the president could bar reporters for any reason, including a \u201cfit of pique.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that Acosta, who was present for the hearing, was not afforded \u201cdue process\u201d because he was not told his pass would be revoked beforehand or given a way to appeal the decision before he was prevented from entering White House grounds. He requested a two-week preliminary return of Acosta\u2019s pass while the process moved forward.\n\nA 1977 D.C. Circuit court ruling held that the government cannot deny a White House hard pass \u201carbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons\u201d and must follow a clear process to do it. Kelly noted during the hearing that he would be bound by that court\u2019s decision in issuing a ruling, and Boutrous cited the case repeatedly in his arguments.\n\nBurnham, arguing for the White House, acknowledged that the administration had dropped its initial argument against Acosta: That he had inappropriately touched a White House aide who tried to take a microphone away from him at the press conference.\n\nBut he said Acosta\u2019s behavior at the press conference still justified his expulsion, saying his repeated attempts to question the president after Trump tried to move on were \u201cdisruptive.\u201d And in response to questions from Kelly, he said the administration would be justified in pulling a hard pass because of disputes over reporting, saying barring a reporter from a press conference was no different than refusing to grant them a private interview.\n\nBurnham conceded that he did not know who in the administration made the actual decision to strip Acosta of his press pass \u2014 it was announced on Twitter by Sanders \u2014 and said it did not matter that there are no set-out or written standards governing reporter behavior in the White House. Boutros seized on those points to argue that Acosta was not afforded due process.\n\nKelly, a Trump appointee, seemed skeptical of some of CNN's arguments and appeared to agree that Acosta had been disruptive at the press conference. Boutrous responded that Trump set a tone of rudeness. \u201cHe is the most aggressive, dare I say rude, person in the room,\u201d Boutros said. \u201c[If] President Trump wants it to be a free-for-all, that\u2019s his prerogative.\u201d\n\nThe White House argued in its legal filing Wednesday that because it has granted hard passes to many other CNN employees, the network cannot say its coverage led to Acosta\u2019s expulsion. The 28-page document mentioned six times that 50 CNN employees have hard passes. Boutrous pointed out that most of those employees are technicians and photographers, part of the large staff a TV network maintains to cover events live at the White House.\n\nReporters have denounced the decision to pull Acosta's access. Thirteen news organizations including Fox News, NBC and POLITICO announced Wednesday they would file amicus briefs supporting CNN's lawsuit.\n\n\"It is imperative that independent journalists have access to the President and his activities, and that journalists are not barred for arbitrary reasons. Our news organizations support the fundamental constitutional right to question this President, or any President,\" a joint statement from the news organizations said.\n\nMeanwhile, on CNN, coverage appeared to be business-as-usual Wednesday.\n\nCNN White House reporters Jeff Zeleny and Kaitlan Collins reported live from outside the White House on the latest West Wing personnel turmoil, neither of them mentioning the court hearing playing out across the town.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, we\u2019re compartmentalizing our coverage,\u201d a CNN source told POLITICO. White House reporters will continue focusing on what\u2019s happening at the White House, this person said, while other CNN journalists cover the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States is the most important person we cover,\u201d the source added. \u201cWe will cover the president as we always have.

That includes more than 160 appointments before 1860 for positions that included secretaries of State, Treasury, War, Navy and Interior.\n\nDOJ also found an example from 1866 when a non-Senate confirmed assistant attorney general took over as acting attorney general.\n\n\u201cMr. Whitaker\u2019s designation is no more constitutionally problematic than countless similar presidential orders dating back over 200 years,\u201d Engel wrote.\n\nWhile much of the Justice Department memo is devoted to the long history of similar appointments, the Supreme Court has sometimes scoffed at such arguments when the justices conclude that such practices fly in the face of the Constitution.\n\nIn 2012, the Justice Department issued a similar legal opinion justifying three of President Barack Obama's appointments to the National Labor Relations Board. And in 2014, the justices unanimously ruled those appointments unconstitutional. However, they appeared divided on how much deference to give to tradition in such disputes.\n\nComplaints about Whitaker have only grown since Trump last week tapped Whitaker the day after the November mid-term elections where Democrats won control of the House. Already, the state of Maryland has filed a motion Tuesday in federal court seeking to overturn the Whitaker appointment. Incoming House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has said Whitaker would be his first witness when Democrats take control of the lower chamber in January.\n\nIn promoting Whitaker, Trump has also sparked an uproar because of his past criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation examining any potential conspiracy between Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nWhitaker in his new role has taken over supervising duties of Mueller\u2019s work from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who was in charge of the special counsel because Sessions had previously recused himself from the topic.\n\nDOJ initially said Whitaker had no plans to back away from overseeing Mueller, but on Monday it signaled the acting attorney general was consulting with senior DOJ ethics officials and reopened the possibility he could recuse himself.\n\nJosh Gerstein contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Burgess Everett", "title": "Schumer re-elected to lead Senate Democrats", "description": "The Senate leadership is falling into place.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/senate-leadership-vote-picks-989877", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/35/d5/409248644be696005cbe85ac1011/181114-chuck-schumer-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:16:49Z", "content": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was first elected to the Senate in 1998. | AP Photo/J.

The Texas Republican is planning to soon circulate draft legislation to fix the \"retail glitch\" and other hiccups in the new tax law, along with a tax extenders package, our Aaron Lorenzo reports. It could be House Republicans' last tax hurrah before slipping into the minority next year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTax pros and those affected by the retail glitch have been waiting for months to see if Republicans would put forward a technical corrections bill for the tax law, H.R. 1 (115). Of course, retailers and restaurant owners consider their problem to be more than just technical. The glitch requires them to write off certain investments over decades, rather than over one year as Republicans intended. Brady said his legislation will include 70 to 80 other alterations to the law, the vast majority of which he characterized as very minor clarifications, Aaron wrote. \"Again, we'll see what appetite there is to pass some or the bulk of them before the end of the year,\" Brady said.\n\nThe second piece of legislation includes a group of tax incentives with expiration dates that didn't make it into 2015 legislation that made dozens of other extenders permanent. \"We have developed a draft package approach on the temporary measures that we're going to visit with our members about, Ranking Member [Richard] Neal and the Senate as well,\" Brady told reporters. He's been a longtime advocate of ending the annual extenders ritual, but it never seems to work out.\n\nNOW IT CAN BE TOLD: The incentive packages that states, cities and counties were offering Amazon to host its second headquarters have been largely veiled in secrecy. But the company\u2019s decision to split the HQ, and its 50,000 jobs, between Arlington\u2019s Crystal City and Long Island City in Queens has pulled the veil back a bit. To wit: The state of New York will provide $1.2 billion in tax credits and a $325 million capital grant; the company also plans to apply for up to $1 billion in other incentives through NYC programs, POLITICO New York\u2019s Dana Rubinstein reported. In Virginia, state and county officials will fork over $573 million in cash grants, the Technology team\u2019s Steven Overly reported. Tennessee will provide a $21.7 million tax credit to offset franchise and excise taxes for an \"Operations Center of Excellence\" in Nashville, the company said in a blog post announcing the deals.\n\nThe tax incentive offered by New York will come in the form of a refundable tax credit \"calculated as a percentage of the salaries Amazon expects to pay employees over the next 10 years, which equates to $48,000 per job for 25,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000,\" Amazon said. Arlington's cash grant will come from expected growth in revenue from its hotel room tax. The city will also \"dedicate an estimated $28 million based on 12% of future property tax revenues earned from an existing Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district for on-site infrastructure and open space\" in Crystal City, Amazon said. The company offered no explanation for the wide difference in incentives between the two cities, though it presumably has to do with higher taxes and other expenses in New York City.\n\nWhile New York and Virginia officials hailed Amazon\u2019s decision as an economic coup for their regions, naysayers came out of the woodwork. \u201cThe arrangements have drawn the ire of Amazon critics including incoming Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district neighbors Long Island City,\u201d Steven reported. \u201c\u2018Amazon is a billion-dollar company,\u201d she tweeted late Monday night. \"\u2019The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.\u2019\u201d\n\nA BIG WEDNESDAY WELCOME to you from the Pro Tax crew.

In Virginia, state and city governments are pledging more than half a billion dollars in transportation investments, including improvements to metro stations, a new pedestrian bridge and upgrades to Route 1, according to The Washington Post. But the arrival of tens of thousands of high-income workers to Crystal City (or should I say National Landing?) could displace residents, sending them to car-dependent suburbs and worsening gridlock. \u201cIf 25,000 jobs means 25,000 more cars, transportation is not going to work,\u201d a D.C. council member told the Post.\n\nLIC catastrophe? A few miles up I-95, some worry that the influx of workers for the planned Long Island City headquarters could add more strain to the city\u2019s subway system, which already suffers from regular delays and overcrowding. \u201cAmazon is a billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here,\u201d wrote Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Twitter.\n\nPotential impacts for TSA: Federal transportation leaders are keeping their eyes on Amazon\u2019s move, too. Our Stephanie Beasley writes that TSA chief David Pekoske told reporters Tuesday that the agency is studying four airports in New York and Virginia near the company\u2019s future headquarters to ensure they have sufficient staffing. \"What we do is, is we look at projected passenger throughput levels well in advance \u2014 very carefully coordinated with the airlines and the airports \u2014 and then make our staffing adjustments well in advance of when we expect to see additional passengers arrive through the airports,\" he said.\n\nIT\u2019S WEDNESDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

His loss all but assures that Missouri Republican Rep. Sam Graves, who currently leads the Highways and Transit Subcommittee, will be the ranking member on the full committee come January. Meanwhile, results are still out in Florida, where Commerce ranking member Bill Nelson remains locked in a recount battle with Republican Gov. Rick Scott. \u201cThis process is about one thing: Making sure every ballot is counted,\u201d Nelson said at a press conference with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday. A hand recount could be triggered Thursday at the end of a machine recount, POLITICO Florida\u2019s Marc Caputo reports. President Donald Trump ramped up the pressure on Nelson, calling on him to concede amid unproven allegations of \u201celection theft.\u201d\n\nON DECK TODAY: The Senate is expected to vote on passage of a Coast Guard reauthorization bill, S. 140 (115). Senators voted 93-5 to begin debate on the measure Tuesday evening. The bill would authorize funding for the service through fiscal 2019 and allow it to enter into multiyear contracting agreements for new National Security Cutters, among other items.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nHUNGRY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE: Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who is expected to chair the Commerce Committee next year, told reporters Tuesday that he \u201cwould love to sink my teeth into an infrastructure package.\u201d In terms of financing, Wicker is \u201cinterested in listening to suggestions, including those outside the box,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 3P idea, any number of innovative solutions that states have been successful in doing would be food for thought.\u201d Wicker added that soon-to-be House Transportation Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) \u201csaid it had to be a realistic pay-for. And who could disagree with that?\u201d He then asked: \u201cWhat if we made the wall a part of the infrastructure package?\u201d But he added: \u201cI\u2019m just asking questions.\u201d\n\nNope: DeFazio quickly shot down the wall idea. \u201cI have no interest in wading into that issue. Infrastructure should stand alone. It doesn\u2019t need to be traded for anything,\u201d he told MT. DeFazio said he wants to work with Trump on the issue, and come up with \u201creal funding.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m not getting into the border wall, that\u2019s not going to be a tradeoff, that\u2019s not for me to do,\u201d he said.\n\nWays and Means progress: DeFazio also told MT he spoke to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Tuesday night about the idea of creating a Ways and Means subcommittee specifically for infrastructure, which he has pushed for along with Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.). \u201cI think we\u2019re on track,\u201d DeFazio said.\n\nAUTOMOBILES\n\nHITTING THE ROAD: The future is just about here. Self-driving car company Waymo is planning to launch the world\u2019s first commercial driverless car service in the suburbs around Phoenix, Ariz., next month, according to Bloomberg. \u201cThe age-old guessing game of how long it will take for cars to drive themselves has come to an end. The better question now: How long will it take them to reach me?\u201d writes Tom Randall. Another key question: Will Congress be able to catch up? Our Tanya Snyder wrote earlier this week that there\u2019s pressure on the Senate to agree on a federal legislative framework for self-driving cars before the next Congress, and Waymo\u2019s progress will add another reason to get a bill done.\n\nSpeaking of which: Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said Tuesday that the fate of that bill, S. 1885 (115), will \u201cdepend entirely on the Democrats, coming out of the election, whether or not they want to get a deal.\u201d There are \u201ca couple of discrete issues where we haven\u2019t been able to close the deal out,\u201d Thune said. \u201cBut I think that if we can get consent to move something, I think it\u2019s still possible to get it done. It would be really good if we did \u2014 the technology\u2019s moving fast.\u201d In response to a reporter\u2019s question, Thune said the legislation could ride on a spending measure \u2014 \u201cif we can get an agreement.\u201d\n\nAviation\n\nBOEING PROBE RAMPS UP: The FAA launched an investigation of Boeing\u2019s safety analyses Tuesday, as part of the agency\u2019s response to the deadly Lion Air crash in October. Investigators suspect that problems with a new automated flight-control system, which is part of the the company\u2019s new 737 MAX models, may have played a role in the crash. The Wall Street Journal reports that FAA is reviewing details of the safety data and conclusions that Boeing had previously provided to the agency, as well as looking into training requirements for pilots.\n\nHill reaction: DeFazio told MT that he hasn\u2019t been briefed by his staff yet, but is watching the story, which he said is a \u201cvery, very serious concern. Whenever you have the potential for a design flaw failure, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to get on right away.\u201d\n\nTURKEY DAY TRAVEL UPDATE: Stephanie reported Tuesday that TSA is gearing up for a potentially record-breaking level of Thanksgiving holiday travel by adding new screening technology and implementing a contentious canine screening program. The agency is using automated screening lanes, 3D computed tomography scanners and ID authentication tech, and adding 1,200 agents and 80 canine teams. Pekoske said the agency will also continue to use expedited canine screening, which has been criticized by lawmakers, at least through the end of the year. Airlines for America is projecting that 30.6 million passengers will fly on U.S. airlines from Nov. 16-27.\n\nRail\n\nI THINK I CAN: Two Democratic members of the House Transportation railroads subpanel told MT on Tuesday that they sure wouldn\u2019t mind chairing the panel in the next Congress. \u201cIf the opportunity presented itself, I would jump at the opportunity,\u201d Rep. Donald Payne of New Jersey said. \u201cBut there are a lot of members that are senior to me in the actual Dem caucus. So we\u2019re still trying to figure that whole thing out.\u201d On the Transportation Committee, Reps. Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.), Albio Sires (D-N.J.), John Garamendi (D-Calif.) and Andr\u00e9 Carson (D-Ind.) are among those more senior than Payne, he noted. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually said I\u2019m interested,\u201d Payne added. \u201cI\u2019m finding out if they\u2019re interested,\u201d he said about his colleagues.\n\nMeanwhile: Illinois Rep.

European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m meets with U.S. Trade Representative Robert LIghthizer today and hopes Trump keeps his promise of keeping auto tariffs at bay. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission wants the U.S. to step up its fight against China at the WTO. Start here:\n\nTHE WINDING ROAD TO THE G-20: Trump\u2019s strategy ahead of a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is about as clear as mud, but there has been some work behind the scenes. Trump met last Thursday with his envoy to Beijing, Terry Branstad, as well as Lighthizer, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and chief of staff John Kelly. The meeting was supposed to map out the best way to talk to China about national security and trade, said a source briefed on the meeting.\n\nThe White House wants to \u201cpush the Chinese to where they need to get in order to make a deal,\u201d the source said about the upcoming meeting, and thinks China is ready to do that now that Republicans showed they could maintain control of the Senate.\n\nThe Mnuchin angle: It\u2019s still unclear what Trump wants to get out of Xi during the face-to-face, but China watchers say they are wary of news that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin could meet in the coming weeks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He ahead of the G-20 meeting. As of Friday, USTR had not been involved in the planning of that meeting, said one source familiar with the planning. Even at Treasury, staff-level China experts haven\u2019t been involved in planning for a potential meeting or preparation for the G-20 get together, according to two sources close to the process.\n\n\u201cIf USTR is not involved, then we have the same problem as before,\u201d said one of the sources, referring to a failed effort to reach a deal in May that was led by Mnuchin. Hardliners fear that another effort with Mnuchin at the helm could lead to an outcome that doesn\u2019t pressure Beijing to address substantive issues related to China\u2019s intellectual property and technology transfer policies.\n\nIT'S WEDNESDAY, NOV. 14!

Kicking things off will be Nelson Mullins partner and former U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Wilkins. Get the details and sign up.\n\nKUDLOW UNLEASHES ON NAVARRO\u2019S CHINA COMMENTS: As if we weren\u2019t confused enough about what message the administration is trying to send to China ahead of the meeting between Trump and Xi, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro did the president a \u201cgreat disservice\u201d in his remarks last Friday.\n\n\u201cHe was not speaking for the president, nor was he speaking for the administration. His remarks were way off base. They were not authorized by anybody,\u201d Kudlow said on CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nNavarro had said there would be a \u201cstench\u201d around any deal that involves the influence of Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street players. Kudlow said the president \u201ccan talk to whomever he can talk to. He talks to people on Wall Street, yes.\u201d\n\nKudlow added that \u201cwe\u2019re having communications at all levels of U.S. and Chinese government.\u201d\n\nKoch groups weigh in on G-20: The Koch network of free trade groups are urging Trump and Xi to end the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. In a letter released this morning, Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners and The Libre Initiative called for dropping the tariffs, which they say have hurt the global economy.\n\nNO CAR TARIFFS YET; MALMSTR\u00d6M STILL EXPECTS EU REPRIEVE: The Commerce Department is still working on its report on whether imports of autos and auto part imports threaten national security, according to a senior administration official \u2014 but when it recommends tariffs as expected, European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m wants the U.S. to keep its promise to spare the EU.\n\n\u201cWe assume if that were to happen, that would not be for the European Union,\u201d Malmstr\u00f6m said Tuesday in remarks at the German Marshall Fund.\n\nCommerce\u2019s Section 232 investigation could allow Trump to impose 20 percent or 25 percent duties on auto and auto part imports.\n\nMalmstr\u00f6m is halfway through a two-day trip to the United States to discuss the parameters of future negotiations. Malmstr\u00f6m will meet with Lighthizer today. Doug has more here.\n\nCHINA COMMISSION URGES NEW FIGHT AT WTO: The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission is encouraging Congress to step up the fight against China\u2019s trade practices in its annual report to Congress today.\n\nTop among 26 recommendations is that lawmakers urge the administration to pursue a rarely invoked \u201cnon-violation nullification or impairment\" case against Beijing at the WTO. That type of case would allow countries to challenge China for economic practices that don\u2019t violate specific WTO rules but prevent Beijing from meeting its obligation to maintain a open and market-oriented economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear [President Xi Jinping] and the Chinese communist party have taken control of the economy and not necessarily in the most healthy or productive way,\u201d commission Chairwoman Robin Cleveland told reporters Tuesday. Read the full story here.\n\nHOW THE CHINA TRADE FIGHT COULD GET EVEN WORSE: Consumers have not yet felt a major hit from Trump\u2019s trade battle with China, but that could change later this year if the countries cannot make a deal. In the latest POLITICO Money podcast, our Doug Palmer explains the potential for Trump to hit more than $500 billion in Chinese imports with tariffs as high as 25 percent over the coming months.\n\nU.S. COUNTER-NOTIFIES AT THE WTO: The U.S. called out India at the WTO for underreporting the extent of its market price support for cotton. The move, known as a \u201ccounter notification,\u201d is part of a broader effort by the U.S. to pressure WTO members to fully disclose subsidies and other domestic measures that affect trade. The U.S. calculated that India\u2019s cotton support program exceeded its allowable threshold for trade-distorting domestic support.\n\nFRUSTRATION MOUNTS OVER TARIFF EXCLUSION \u2018MESS\u2019: The Commerce Department\u2019s tariff exclusion process was meant to ease the burden on U.S. companies that rely on imports, but the Aluminum Association is arguing that even after proposed reforms, the complicated operation is only making things worse.\n\n\"The inherent uncertainty of the product exclusion process is actually adding an unnecessarily prolonged cost burden to our members and their customers and chilling investment in the aluminum industry, rather than promoting domestic production,\" the group said in a letter sent Tuesday to Commerce Department officials.\n\nLauren Wilk, vice president for policy at the Aluminum Association, added in an interview: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a mess.\u201d Doug has more for Pros here.\n\nTRADE STAFF SWITCH-UP AT FINANCE: Nasim Fussell will take over as chief international trade counsel for Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee. She was previously deputy chief trade counsel on the committee. Shane Warren, who fills the top trade staffer position, will be leaving after five years on the panel, a Finance spokeswoman told Morning Trade.\n\nFussell joined the committee earlier this year after working as director of government and regulatory affairs at Pitney Bowes, a mailing equipment and services company. She also served as a trade counsel on the House Ways and Means Committee, working under the chairmanships of Dave Camp (R-Mich.), Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Kevin Brady (R-Texas). During her time on the House panel, she worked to advance trade promotion authority, customs, trade preferences and miscellaneous tariff bill legislation.\n\nChairman question mark: Sen. Chuck Grassley is still on the short list of lawmakers who could take the Finance chairmanship when Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) leaves Congress after this term. But the Iowa Republican said he needs more time to discuss the possible move with his colleagues. To take the top spot on Finance, Grassley would have to give up the gavel to the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cYou ask me that in a few days and I\u2019ll have an answer for you,\u201d Grassley told reporters on Tuesday. POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett has more here on the committee scene in next year\u2019s Senate.\n\nAFTER TARIFFS, SPANISH OLIVE IMPORTS DROP 72 PERCENT: Imports of Spanish table olives to the U.S. dropped by nearly three-quarters in August and September, the first two months after anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties went into effect, the Spanish olive farmers association ASAMESA said Tuesday.\n\nFollowing a complaint from Californian olive producers, which claimed their Spanish competitors benefited from unfair subsidies, Washington in July imposed hefty tariffs ranging from 30 percent to 45 percent on Spanish table olives. Madrid and the European Commission strongly reject the justification for those duties.\n\nBrussels still in talks: The European Commission said Tuesday it continues to raise the issue with U.S. authorities \u2014 including during Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019 visit to Brussels last month \u2014 but has not yet decided whether it would launch a WTO case.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 Vice President Mike Pence says Trump is leaving the door open to making a deal with Xi at the G-20, if the Chinese president agrees to massive economic, political and military changes, a Washington Post columnist writes.\n\n\u2014 Vietnam becomes the seventh country to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Reuters reports.\n\n\u2014 Deputy White House national security adviser Mira Ricardel will soon be dismissed from her job, CNN reports.\n\n\u2014 The United Kingdom and EU have agreed on the draft text of a Brexit agreement, the BBC reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

The program\u2019s acting chief medical officer, Laura Kroupa, technology officer John Short and Travis Dalton from Cerner are also on the menu.\n\nIn a letter last month, subcommittee chair Jim Banks jabbed at the VA\u2019s apparent failure to move forward its Lighthouse EHR modernization project, which was underway before the Cerner decision and includes the creation of an open API gateway.\n\nIf you\u2019ll recall, leading health systems signed an API pledge with the VA at HIMSS in March, but some of those companies are reportedly grumbling that the VA\u2019s work on the project appears dormant. The pledge calls for speeding the mapping of health data to industry standards using FHIR.\n\nWe asked former White House Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra, a big proponent of the open API push, about these concerns, but Chopra wasn\u2019t worried about the delay, given leadership changes at the VA. \u201cThe whole idea of an API gateway is new to health care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe VA\u2019s tech chops have been under close scrutiny of late: earlier this week, NBC News reported that veterans nationwide are suffering from software glitches delaying payment of their benefits.\n\n(For what it\u2019s worth, department secretary Robert Wilkie declared the VA crisis \u201cover\u201d last Friday.)\n\n\u2014 HITAC meeting postponed: Meanwhile, the Health IT Advisory Committee meeting originally scheduled for today has been postponed. Office spokesman Peter Ashkenaz tells Morning eHealth that the committee\u2019s next hearing will be in December, though without a settled date.\n\nThe reason for the postponement? Ashkenaz says that the interoperability standards priorities task force isn\u2019t ready to present its final recommendations.\n\nMeanwhile, committee member Steven Lane tells us the office is gearing up for a rule drop \u2014 presumably the interoperability or info blocking rules currently parked in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s review process \u2014 which might be part of the agenda for a HITAC meeting.

The Association is calling on the government and payors to collect demographic data reflecting a variety of sexual and gender identities; it\u2019s hoping to encourage physicians to educate themselves in population and public health for patients without good access to care; and it\u2019s calling for expansion of broadband and wireless to undeserved areas to promote digital health.\n\nHEALTH IT BUSINESS WATCH\n\nWe\u2019ve got a heaping helping of business news to serve up:\n\n\u2014 Q&A with Munjal Shah: Getting health-conscious people better deals on life insurance is the business model for startup Health IQ. In a conversation with our colleague Arthur Allen, CEO Munjal Shah says that a 30-question quiz can help sort out health-knowledgeable from health-na\u00efve consumers, and get the former group some nice quotes on life insurance.\n\n\u201cPeople do a lot for savings.

Pros can get the rest here.\n\n\u2014 Alphabet re-orgs health work: Alphabet is reshuffling the org chart for its health care companies, CNBC\u2019s Christina Farr reports. The company is moving the health parts of its DeepMind subsidiary into its Google Health unit. (Here\u2019s more detail in the firm\u2019s blog.) Notably, the firm is pledging that data gathered as part of its partnership with Britain\u2019s NHS won\u2019t be used \u201cfor commercial purposes like advertising or insurance.\u201d (An early partnership had led to an uproar from British lawmakers and the public. They feared the potential damages to privacy.)\n\n\u2014 Oscar sues Florida Blue: Buzzy insurance startup Oscar Health is entering a court battle. The company filed a lawsuit against Florida Blue Cross and Blue Shield Tuesday. The suit alleges that 190 brokers backed out of agreements to sell Oscar\u2019s insurance plans, prompted by Florida Blue\u2019s threats.\n\n\"Florida Blue's monopoly power in Florida makes its scheme devastating to a new entrant like Oscar, as well as deeply injurious to Florida consumers,\" according to the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.\n\nFlorida Blue said it's reviewing the complaint but \"from what we know of the New York company's grievances, there is no merit to them at all.\" Contracted agents are independent and can choose whether to work with carriers that operate on an exclusive basis, Florida Blue says. You can read the complaint here, and our colleague Paul Demko\u2019s write-up of the legal tactics here.\n\n\u2014 Virta Health makes big bet on new biz model: Virta Health \u2014 a company that hopes to reverse type 2 diabetes through diet change \u2014 is announcing a new payment model: 100% of its fees are at risk, the startup is announcing today.\n\n\u201cNow that we have both clinical trial and commercial results demonstrating diabetes reversal and cost savings at scale, we are ready to align our economic incentives with those of patients and payers by putting 100 percent of our fees at risk,\u201d said the startup\u2019s co-founder, Sami Inkinen. \u201cI am hopeful that the rest of the healthcare industry will follow and transition away from fee-for-service based health care.\u201d\n\nThe company estimates it can save payors nearly $10,000 per patient over the first two years.\n\n\u2014 Facebook answers on privacy: In answers to the Senate Intelligence Committee for a hearing on operatives\u2019 use of social media to influence debate in America, Facebook admitted that users do not have the ability to opt out of research conducted on them.\n\n\u201cIn our Data Policy, we explain that we may use the information we have to conduct and support research in areas that may include general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health, and well-being,\u201d the letter says. \u201cResearchers are subject to strict restrictions regarding data access and use as part of these collaborations.\u201d\n\nThe hearing comes amid a climate of hot controversy over tech firms\u2019 privacy practices. Legislators from both sides of the aisle have at least publicly said they\u2019re interested in a national privacy bill that might affect health care.\n\nIN THE COURTS\n\nTRUMP TO NOMINATE OIRA CHIEF TO FEDERAL JUDGESHIP: President Trump is nominating Neomi Rao, the head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, to Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s old seat on the DC Circuit, he announced Tuesday. As head of OIRA, Rao oversees the flow of regulatory and deregulatory actions \u2014 playing a role in virtually all of the administration\u2019s regulatory actions.

Participation in the food stamp program by eligible immigrant families rose to 43 percent in 2007-2017 before declining in 2018 to 34.8 percent. Heated immigration rhetoric and increased enforcement and detention are \u201ca likely reason for many people dropping out,\u201d Allison Bovell-Ammon, lead researcher on the study, told Evich (though she conceded that \u201cit could also be because the economy is improving.\u201d) Ellen Vollinger, legal/SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center, a D.C. nonprofit, said: \u201cI think this data really does confirm these anecdotes we've been hearing.\u201d More from POLITICO\u2019s Helena Bottemiller Evich here.\n\nGOOD MORNING!

The contract includes a 14 percent pay increase over four years and increases retirement benefits for 16,000 workers, according to the union.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, workers recognized that the steel industry was struggling and agreed to make sacrifices so that U.S. Steel could get through some tough times,\u201d United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said in a statement. \"Now that the company has recovered and is projected to earn nearly $2 billion this year, workers rightly wanted a share of that success.\"\n\nThe raise doesn\u2019t come close to absorbing the bulk of new profits reported by U.S. Steel. This month, the company reported third-quarter earnings double those in 2017 \u2014 $291 million compared to $147 million, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.\n\nUSW this month reached a tentative agreement with ArcelorMittal, which together with U.S. Steel accounts for 40 percent of the country's flat-rolled steel production.

CRYSTAL CITY?: Amazon on Tuesday confirmed that Crystal City, Virginia, and Long Island City, N.Y., won the yearlong bidding competition for the company's new headquarters, POLITICO\u2019s Steven Overly reports. But will Crystal City\u2019s proximity to the Capitol cut into the pool of tech workers that the federal government needs?\n\n\u201cIf Amazon presents itself as competitive, they will steal away a lot of young federal employees. That\u2019s the first group that will be affected,\u201d Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees, told Bloomberg Law. \u201cThe second group is applicants. The federal government will have a tough time competing\u201d with a private-sector employer that can offer higher pay (expected to average more than $150,000) and better benefits for people with needed skills, Louis C. LeBrecque writes.

But there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll even show for the much-anticipated testimony \u2014 the agenda includes a warning he may be unwilling to participate. Details of the agenda here. Watch the meetings live.\n\n\u2014 Tuesday\u2019s testimony revealed numerous missed warning signs about the Parkland shooter, including that he threatened on multiple occasions to commit a school shooting, made specific threats against black and Jewish people and brought knives, bullets and decapitated animals to school. Most of these incidents, which involved classmates, went unreported until law enforcement began investigating the Feb. 14 massacre. Commissioners implored people to report potential threats instead of brushing them off. More from POLITICO Florida\u2019s Andrew Atterbury.\n\n\u2014 The panel is holding a marathon meeting this week. The four-day session comes after Hurricane Michael canceled the commission\u2019s October meeting. The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, created by a bill signed by Republican Gov. Rick Scott in March, has only one more scheduled gathering before its recommendations for improving school safety and security are due to state lawmakers on Jan.1. Andrew has more.\n\n\u2014 The commissioners \u2014 who include parents who lost children in the shooting \u2014 will hear other difficult testimony this week, including about security measures at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the shooter\u2019s internet searches and cell phone content, 911 calls, radio transmissions as the tragedy unfolded, and the FBI\u2019s review of the shooting. Broward County officials, including Superintendent Robert Runcie and Sheriff Scott Israel are also expected to testify on Thursday.\n\nGOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING, NOV. 14.

Half of the Cabinet officials comprising the White House school safety commission may soon be gone. President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week and is reportedly looking to remove Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\n\u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos chairs the Federal School Safety Commission \u2014 which the White House launched earlier this year in response to the Parkland shooting. HHS Secretary Alex Azar is also a member. Senior agency officials have participated in the commission\u2019s meetings when Cabinet officials have been unavailable. The panel is expected to produce a report detailing its recommendations by year\u2019s end.\n\n\u2014 Advocates expect that report to address controversial issues like arming teachers and school discipline, in addition to student data sharing and privacy, school building security, and mental health. Conservatives are hoping the commission scraps Obama-era guidelines on school discipline, which they see as a burden on school districts and possibly dangerous because of their potential to keep violent children in school. The guidelines were issued in 2014 with the goal of ensuring that schools aren\u2019t discriminating against students while disciplining them.\n\n\u2014 In other school safety news: Frank Brogan, who leads the Education Department\u2019s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, will update state education leaders about the commission\u2019s progress. Brogan will speak today at an annual policy forum hosted by the Council of Chief State School Officers, an organization that represents state education chiefs nationwide. The forum is in Long Beach, Calif., and Brogan is expected to speak at 11 a.m. local time.\n\nELECTION WATCH\n\nOJEDA FOR PRESIDENT: West Virginia state legislator Richard Ojeda \u2014 a passionate supporter of striking state teachers earlier this year \u2014 has announced he\u2019s running for president only days after losing his bid for West Virginia\u2019s 3rd District.

Bipartisan pressure has been building on the VA to fix the IT-related problems.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThis is an unnecessary and preventable crisis, and the Department of Veterans Affairs must take immediate action to remedy it,\u201d House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Tuesday in a statement.\n\n\u2014 Paul R. Lawrence, the undersecretary for benefits in the VA\u2019s Veterans Benefit Administration, is among the officials expected to speak at the hearing, which starts at 4 p.m. in 334 Cannon.\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, the group Veterans Education Success plans to release an issue brief today that explores why selective colleges enroll far fewer veterans pursuing undergraduate degrees than graduate-level programs. The brief will be released at a College Board conference in Arlington, Va., focused on improving college opportunities for veterans.\n\nVIRGINIA TECH TO OPEN NORTHERN VIRGINIA CAMPUS NEAR AMAZON SITE: Virginia Tech says it will build a 1-million-square-foot campus in Alexandria, Va., that will complement Amazon's new headquarters site. The $1 billion project will focus on providing graduate degree programs and research opportunities in computer sciences and software engineering.\n\n\u2014 Virginia Tech President Tim Sands told Morning Education the idea to build an innovation campus had been in the works for about four years. But when the possibility of Amazon building a second headquarters in the region came under discussion, school officials accelerated that effort.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWhen Amazon and the state came calling about 14 months ago, and asked us to help lead a higher education package that would provide the talent resources that a company like Amazon and any company would need, we stepped right up and said that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on right now,\u2019\u201d Sands said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll just dovetail this into our plans.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, Jennifer Wexton, the Democrat who last week defeated Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock to represent Virginia\u2019s 10th District, raised concerns about whether Northern Virginia has \u201cthe necessary infrastructure, including roads, transit, schools and affordable housing, to properly welcome Amazon to our region.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Amazon is building a second HQ in Long Island City, New York. One Democratic state lawmaker wants to halt the flow of any taxpayer money to the retail giant. \u201cDemocratic Assemblyman Ron Kim announced that he will introduce legislation to slash New York\u2019s economic development subsidies and use the money to buy up and cancel student debt \u2014 a move he said would provide a bigger boost to the state\u2019s economy,\u201d Capital & Main reports.\n\n\u2014 Chalkbeat looks at how Amazon\u2019s arrival could impact students in New York.\n\nDEVOS SUED OVER LOAN DISCHARGES FOR STUDENTS AT CLOSED SCHOOLS: A California consumer advocacy group on Tuesday sued DeVos for failing to automatically cancel the federal loans owed by students whose education was interrupted by the sudden closure of their colleges. The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring DeVos to carry out the automatic loan discharges for students who attended hundreds of campuses that closed before the students could complete their academic programs. Michael Stratford has more.\n\nTEXAS TO KEEP CLINTON IN HISTORY CURRICULUM: The Texas State Board of Education on Tuesday night reversed course and voted to keep Hillary Clinton, Helen Keller and other historical figures in the state\u2019s social studies curriculum. The state board voted in September to cut Clinton in an effort to \u201cstreamline\u201d the curriculum. But backlash was swift, with groups accusing state education officials of allowing politics to influence what kids are taught. The state board will take a final vote on the overall curriculum at week\u2019s end.

There has been no shortage of reports urging massive changes to the internet ecosystem, but Altabef said the cyber moonshot was \u201cfundamentally different.\u201d\n\nOne thing that distinguishes the moonshot, according to Altabef, is its focus on interdependencies in networked technology. \u201cI don\u2019t think that has been done before,\u201d he said. \u201cMost cybersecurity efforts are near-term, interim, and relatively piecemeal.\u201d He also argued that the report\u2019s tight recommended timeframe would spur action. \u201cThis is a 10-year effort, but it is also a six-month effort and a one-year effort,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s urgency to this. It is not all \u2018wake up in 10 years and it\u2019s fixed.\u2019 We expect significant things to be happening during this process.\u201d\n\nThe moonshot report is the product of more than a year of effort by a subcommittee of the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, whose members have kept in close touch with officials at DHS and other agencies. \u201cWe are working in this effort with various parts of the administration very, very well,\u201d Altabef said, describing officials as \u201cvery supportive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of at a watershed moment,\u201d said Altabef, who argued that the U.S. had to yet experience a \u201cSputnik moment\u201d in cybersecurity. \u201cWe can wait for that to occur,\u201d he said, \u201cor we can start something like this and try to head that off. \u2026 That becomes a whole-of-nation effort.\u201d\n\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

Now, as the president unshackles the organization, the architects of the newest U.S. military command offer rare insights into its origins and mission.\n\nA decade ago, the U.S. military was just beginning to confront the risk of digital espionage and cyber warfare. \u201cWhat [Defense Secretary Robert Gates] came up with and we discussed was, how do you better defend? Why do we have the offense and the defense in separate teams? Why don\u2019t you put those together?\u201d former NSA chief Keith Alexander told Martin. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to set up a new command, you need to do all the planning for that. How do you get the right folks to do that?\u201d\n\nThey became known as \u201cthe Four Horsemen,\u201d a brain trust tasked with hammering out the plan to build the country\u2019s first cyber warfare command and explaining it to a skeptical Washington. Today, Trump has formally elevated its status and made it the Defense Department\u2019s newest \u201cunified combatant command,\u201d only the 10th of its kind. The promotion was followed a series of policy moves by the White House that, taken together, show a willingness to act first and ask questions later in the digital domain. \u201cOur hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration,\u201d national security adviser John Bolton said in September. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a lot of things offensively, and our adversaries need to know that,\u201d he added. Pros can read the full story here.\n\nTODAY: FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC \u2014 Two House panels combine their powers today for a hearing on cybersecurity cooperation between DHS and DoD. \u201cIt is imperative that the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense work hand in glove to protect our nation\u2019s systems, and to provide assistance to our critical infrastructure partners,\u201d Rep. John Ratcliffe, chairman of the House Homeland Security cybersecurity subcommittee, says in prepared opening remarks. Also imperative, according to Ratcliffe: that DHS take the lead. \u201cA civilian led system embodies what the foundation that this democracy was built on.\u201d Ratcliffe\u2019s panel is teaming with the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities for the hearing.\n\nAcross the Capitol, the Senate Armed Services cyber subcommittee scrutinizes DoD cybersecurity acquisition practices. \u201cWhile we have confidence that the Department will bolster its cybersecurity in due time, we believe that this improvement could come as a result of improved cooperation with private sector cybersecurity companies and reconfiguration of the Department\u2019s cybersecurity capabilities to match the state-of-the-art offerings in the private sector,\u201d Sen. Mike Rounds, chairman of the subcommittee, says in prepared remarks.\n\nMAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE LEAVING? \u2014 A possible Trump administration shakeup post-midterms had apparently claimed its first victim Tuesday only for The Wall Street Journal to walk back the story \u2014 although there could still be a reckoning ahead. The Journal reported that Mira Ricardel, Bolton\u2019s top deputy, had been escorted out of the White House, but the administration denied that. Still, Melania Trump\u2019s rare public appeal doesn\u2019t bode well for Ricardel, who was an advocate of eliminating the White House cybersecurity coordinator position and absorbing its duties into her portfolio, as we reported back in May.\n\nDHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s head is also on the block, potentially, but there\u2019s no permanent deputy secretary in place. Claire Grady is acting deputy and would assume the job if Nielsen is pushed out. While Grady has served as the DHS face on some cybersecurity discussions since assuming the role, it\u2019s not a major part of her background. Former Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Thomas Homan, whose background is in law enforcement, is in the mix for long-term replacements, any of whom might shift attention away from cyber. With wildfires raging in California, the timing might be problematic for the president, given DHS\u2019s emergency management role.\n\nCISA\u2019S ON ITS WAY \u2014 The House on Tuesday evening sent a bill (H.R. 3359) to Trump reorganizing DHS\u2019s main cyber division into the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Agency. Nielsen, Ratcliffe and others applauded the House for clearing the legislation. The measure, which Trump is expected to sign given that every leading DHS official and even Vice President Mike Pence lobbied for it, will \u201cbolster public-private partnerships to help ensure businesses have the resources and support necessary before, during, and after a cyber incident,\u201d said Christopher Roberti, the senior vice president for cyber, intelligence and security policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOPM STILL WEAK ON CYBER \u2014 The Office of Personnel Management still has a ways to go to secure its data, according to a Government Accountability Office report released Tuesday. Nearly a third of the 80 recommendations by the GAO after the 2015 breach have not been implemented, leaving the agency that maintains personal data on millions of current and former federal workers \u201cat increased risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or disruption,\u201d the report concluded. However, OPM plans to implement most of the remaining recommendations by the end of fiscal year 2018.\n\nOPM\u2019s security problems are nothing new. A security audit in late October from OPM\u2019s Office of the Inspector General mirrors GAO\u2019s concerns. The audit found that IT operations are \u201cinappropriately decentralized\u201d and that while procedures and policies are documented, they are not consistently implemented.\n\nIN THEIR DEFENSE, IT\u2019S ONLY BEEN THREE YEARS \u2014 The Pentagon hasn\u2019t fully implemented all its requirements under the 2015 cybersecurity information sharing law, according to an inspector general report out Tuesday. The biggest barrier, the IG found, is that DoD\u2019s chief information officer didn\u2019t issue a policy on implementing the law. \u201cAs a result, the DoD limited its ability to gain a more complete understanding of cybersecurity threats since it did not fully leverage the collective knowledge and capabilities of sharing entities, or disseminate internally generated cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with other Federal and non\u2011Federal entities,\u201d the report found. There were also problems with sub-agencies implementing the law and verifying security clearances.\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 Chinese hackers are borrowing techniques from one of Russia\u2019s most infamous hacking groups, according to Recorded Future. \u2026 A senior DoD official said Russian and Chinese cyberattacks on defense suppliers is one of the Pentagon\u2019s biggest problems. \u2026 China contends that a U.S. ban on chipmaker Jinhau violates World Trade Organization rules. \u2026 Incoming House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff called on acting Attorney General Mark Whitaker to recuse himself from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, and warned that Democrats would be watching him.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 *somber music plays*\n\nREPORT WATCH\n\n\u2014 Sophisticated bad bots used in cyberattacks make up 44 percent of all traffic on airline websites, mobile apps and application programming interfaces, according to research out today from Distil Networks.

Participation among eligible immigrant households was down about 10 percentage points over the first half of 2018.\n\n\u2014 ERS, NIFA relocation watch: Critics of USDA\u2019s plans to relocate two research agencies out of D.C. next year are calling for a special provision in an upcoming spending bill to put the moves on hold.\n\n\u2014 The oyster industry is dealing with severe shortages in the Gulf of Mexico. Alabama called off its oyster harvesting season, Gulf states are using oil spill settlement funds to rebuild oyster habitats, and the Supreme Court is even weighing in.\n\nIMMIGRANT FAMILIES DROP FROM SNAP: Remember all those anecdotal reports about immigrants dropping out of SNAP over fears about the current administration\u2019s immigration policies and rhetoric? They may be indicative of a larger national trend, according to preliminary data released this week.\n\nDrop off: Immigrant households legally eligible for food-stamp benefits stopped participating in the program at a higher-than-normal rate in the first half of this year, the data show.\n\nFirst dive: The data is the first broad look at Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation declines among immigrants, surveying more than 35,000 mothers across five U.S. cities. It found that participation dropped by nearly 10 percentage points in the first half of 2018 for immigrant households that are eligible for the program and have been in the U.S. less than five years \u2014 compared with a participation rate of 43 percent from 2007 to 2017.\n\n\u2014 The study seems to confirm months of anecdotal reports, from New York to San Antonio, Texas, that widespread fear in immigrant communities has had a chilling effect on participation in SNAP and other government aid programs like WIC, a federal nutrition program aimed at pregnant women and children.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWe were hearing the anecdotal reports of people dropping out of SNAP and WIC, so we started looking at our data to see if that was true among the families we interview,\u201d said Allison Bovell-Ammon, lead researcher and deputy director for policy strategy at Boston Medical Center\u2019s Children\u2019s HealthWatch, which conducted the study.

(Of course, it can always extend that deadline by passing another short-term stopgap.)\n\nRep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.), who is in line to become chairman of the Appropriations Agriculture-FDA subpanel, told Pro Ag last month that appropriators were thinking about taking some sort of action on the ERS and NIFA plans: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly looking at that and considering it.\u201d\n\nOYSTER SHORTAGES IN THE GULF: The oyster industry is facing severe shortages in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a report released today from The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit group. The oyster population has declined by about 85 percent in the Gulf region, which leads the nation in commercial production.\n\nThe situation has become so grave that Alabama for the first time called off its oyster harvesting season due to scarcity. Officials are under pressure to balance protecting oysters as a commodity and as part of a habitat \u2014 the shellfish are integral to the survival of other marine wildlife.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only getting worse,\u201d said Seth Blitch, the Nature Conservancy\u2019s director of coastal and marine conservation in Louisiana. \u201cThese states are faced with trying to maintain stocks so there is a commercial harvest while trying to maintain natural resources, too.\u201d\n\nWhere have all the oysters gone? The shortages, researchers say, aren\u2019t so much about water quality as they are about water quantity. Imbalances of freshwater caused by droughts, hurricanes and other factors have decimated ecosystems and harvests.\n\nThe fight over freshwater access for oysters has even made its way to the Supreme Court \u2014 Florida and Georgia have been locked in a decadeslong battle over water access. In June, a divided court gave the Sunshine State another chance to prove Georgia was harming its oyster habitat by consuming too much water from the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River basin.\n\n\u2014 The case, which has been sent back to a court-appointed special master for a final decision, could foreshadow how courts will play a role juggling water usage between humans and wildlife.\n\nHow to rebuild: States are tapping into their funds from the 2010 BP oil spill settlement reserved solely for oyster restoration. Texas, for example, announced today that it\u2019s using $5 million of those funds to build an artificial reef that can be used for both restoration and harvesting.\n\nTRADE MEETINGS ON DECK: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m will meet today in D.C. to continue laying the groundwork ahead of formal bilateral negotiations starting as soon as mid-January.\n\nEuropean nations are considering ramping up their purchases of U.S. biofuel ingredients like rapeseed, our POLITICO Pro Europe colleagues reported this week \u2014 a potential olive branch for American farmers that might help the EU keep broader agricultural issues out of the upcoming trade talks.\n\nBut President Donald Trump wasn\u2019t exactly feeling the love Tuesday morning, when he targeted France with a tweetstorm including a gripe about French wine tariffs. He\u2019s set to meet with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the G-20 gathering this month in Buenos Aires.\n\nMain event: He\u2019ll also join Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 for a highly anticipated face-to-face discussion on trade (and other issues). Our colleagues on the POLITICO White House team tell MA that U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad met with Trump in D.C. last Thursday to go over plans for the meeting with Xi.

Here\u2019s more on the final result.\n\n\u2014 Anti-pesticide groups oppose Hutchins\u2019 nomination: More than 245 groups against the broad use of pesticides are opposing Scott Hutchins\u2019 nomination as USDA chief scientist because they say his ties to Corteva Agriscience, a division of DowDuPont, \u201cpresent serious conflicts of interest that will undoubtedly affect his ability\u201d to serve in the role if confirmed by the Senate. You can find the letter here.\n\n\u2014 Atrazine levels widespread in corn belt water sources: The Environmental Working Group today released a new analysis of drinking water contaminated by the weedkiller atrazine in corn-growing regions. EWG found that potentially harmful levels of the herbicide have been detected in drinking water for nearly 30 million Americans across 28 states. The group previously released a tap water quality database as part of its efforts to raise attention about agriculture\u2019s impact on water quality in rural areas.\n\n\u2014 Immigrant ag workers still reeling from Hurricane Florence: Undocumented laborers in North Carolina, fearing possible deportation, have avoided seeking disaster assistance after the storm caused severe flooding in the state\u2019s major pork producing regions.

The details of the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol are still being finalized, but a pilot project will launch in 2019 and full implementation is expected for the 2020 crop year. Read more here.\n\n\u2014 Green group partners with corn growers: The National Corn Growers Association and Environmental Defense Fund in a new partnership being announced today plan to focus on metrics to track progress on practices designed to improve water quality, soil health and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on American farms, while promoting profitability. Beyond data collection, the two groups also will work together on advocating for voluntary conservation programs with measurable outcomes.\n\n\u2014 An orange forecast: Over the next three years, Florida orange production is expected to drop as old groves are replaced and new ones start to bear fruit \u2014 continuing a steady decline over the last two decades largely due to citrus greening disease, according to a new report by CoBank, a top lender to rural agribusinesses, cooperatives and utilities. Imports of orange juice from Brazil are on track to increase to meet U.S. demand.\n\n\u2014 How dicamba drift came to be: Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting and the Food & Environment Reporting Network did a deep dive on the history of dicamba and EPA\u2019s recent decision to reauthorize the controversial pesticide for two years, despite some scientists warning of continued unintended damage to crops.\n\nTHAT\u2019S ALL FOR MA!

It\u2019s nominally a nonpartisan race, but it\u2019s no secret which candidate California Democrats prefer: The California Teachers Association, that steadfast liberal ally, and the California Democratic Party have invested millions in pushing state Assemblyman Tony Thurmond over the top, while Sen. Kamala Harris and now-Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom boosted Thurmond in campaign ads and appearances. They\u2019re all seeking to counteract the millions that have flowed from charter school allies to back Marshall Tuck.\n\n-- A protracted deficit for Thurmond in the days after the election suggested a rare defeat for the CTA might be coming. But after Thurmond went from trailing to a vanishingly tiny statistical margin \u2014 he and Tuck were at one point locked in a dead heat Tuesday \u2014 his lead jumped to well over 60,000 votes on the strength of a late update. With a mountain of ballots left to count \u2014 keep in mind Tuck was up by tens of thousands just days ago \u2014 this one bears watching.\n\n-- ONE MORE HOTSPOT: Also worth keeping an eye on: the 16th state Assembly District, where longstanding efforts to topple the Bay Area\u2019s sole Republican lawmaker could come to fruition.

But I don't think they've seen this same intensity from House Republicans,\u201d he said in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nJordan cited conservative priorities like repealing the Affordable Care Act, building Trump's long-promised wall along the southern border and overhauling welfare programs as areas where Republicans came up short, despite control of both houses of Congress and the White House. Those failures, he said were the reason for Republicans\u2019 trouncing on Election Day, when they lost at least 34 seats.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know.

That's the environment we're going into.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "ahurst@politico.com (Adrienne Hurst)", "title": "MENDOZA makes it official \u2014 DRAMA at Springfield presser \u2014 ETHICS about diversion programs", "description": null, "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/illinois-playbook/2018/11/14/mendoza-makes-it-official-drama-at-springfield-presser-ethics-about-diversion-programs-346382", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:14:20Z", "content": "Good Wednesday morning, Illinois.

Now she\u2019s out with her mayoral campaign video\u2014the real video\u2014announcing her run and telling her personal story. How she grew up in the Little Village neighborhood, how her family moved away after gun violence on her block, and how she returned to the neighborhood. \u201cSafe neighborhoods, good schools, high property taxes, they\u2019re not just issues to me,\u201d Mendoza says in the video. \u201cI live them, too.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a strong message, but will it give her the oomph she needs to surpass others hoping to stand out in the race?\n\nMendoza, 46, brings youthfulness to the campaign, but also experience \u2014 she\u2018s previously served in the state legislature and as city clerk. In that position she\u2019s credited with modernizing the sticker program that once had residents waiting in line for hours. And she\u2019s experienced at running a political campaign. Mendoza already has a team out gathering the required signatures needed to get on the ballot.\n\nHer fluent Spanish could be a force in bringing out Latino voters.\n\nWith her entry into the campaign, the candidate playing field is almost set.

Bruce Rauner vetoed before the midterms. Tuesday was a lot of procedural work with little action. But there was some political theater. It centered on a vetoed bill that calls for more regulation of \u201cpeer to peer\u201d rental car companies. Those are businesses that allow individuals to rent out their own cars much the way home owners rent out their homes. A group of D\u2019s and R\u2019s gathered with Hertz and other rental-car company officials at a press conference calling for an override. They say it\u2019s necessary because car owners don\u2019t always adhere to safety regulations. The bill would require that and would make sure car owners pay their fair share of taxes at airports, just the way rental car companies do.\n\nAfter the press conference, a man stood up saying he represents Turo, one of the companies that a company that manages those car rentals. It was a dramatic move that got him kicked out of the room since he didn\u2019t reserve it. More interesting, he announced his name: Lou Bertuca. Yeah that Lou Bertuca, the former aide to Gov. Pat Quinn. Bertuca now lives in California and oversees government relations for Turo. In the hallway, he told reporters the bill would unfairly tax individuals trying to make a living.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what lawmakers think. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Tony Munoz, was working the state Senate floor Tuesday afternoon to gather votes for an override.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2014 Democrats and Republicans re-elected their top leaders last night during private gatherings in Springfield.

Cohn, known for years as a Wall Street tough guy, regularly displayed his disdain for protectionist trade adviser Peter Navarro, moving to reduce Navarro\u2019s role and keeping him out of meetings. Kudlow, genteel and gregarious by nature, has tried to stay on good terms with Navarro and keep policy disputes civil and inside the building.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat changed on Tuesday with Kudlow publicly rebuking Navarro during a CNBC interview over Navarro\u2019s deeply hawkish China speech on Friday. The vibe coming out of the White House \u2014 partly in response to market declines \u2014 has been that progress is being made with China and that the G-20 meeting could pave the way for a deal. Navarro stomped all over that. And Kudlow was unhappy.\n\nAnd he spoke in ways that had to have approval from the president. Kudlow and Trump kibitz regularly in person and by phone and it\u2019s very difficult to imagine that the NEC director spoke this way about Navarro without approval from the president. This matters because among the most consequential economic decisions facing the White House right now is whether to enter into a full-blown trade war with China.\n\nHere\u2019s what Kudlow said: \u201cLook, Peter Navarro is a friend of mine, truly. We\u2019ve known each other for 20 years, but he was not speaking for the president, nor was he speaking for the administration. His remarks were way off base. They were not authorized by anybody. I actually think he did the president a great disservice. Look, the president can talk to whomever he can talk to. He talks to people on Wall Street, yes. He talks to union leaders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in some of those meetings. He talks to other outside advisers. He has every right to do so. And the president has said \u2026 that if there is a deal to be had with China, it\u2019s a deal that has to be in American interests. So I think Peter very badly misspoke. He was freelancing and he\u2019s not representing the president or the administration.\u201d\n\nWIN FOR THE FREE TRADERS (FOR NOW) \u2014 The White House meeting on Tuesday on auto tariffs concluded with an agreement not to move forward with the levies for now, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The Commerce Department will continue to work on a report about whether imported autos impact national security. Trump has been hot to slap the tariffs on for quite a while but the auto industry doesn\u2019t want them. And markets don\u2019t want them. And they would presumably complicate negotiations with the EU barring a blanket exemption. For now they will remain a threat in Trump\u2019s back pocket.\n\nCRUNCH TIME ON TRADE \u2014 In the latest POLITICO Money podcast, POLITICO senior trade reporter Doug Palmer explains the potential for Trump to hit over $500 billion in Chinese imports with tariffs as high as 25 percent over the coming months. Consumers would feel such tariffs immediately and quite painfully.\n\nTrump is scheduled to sit down with Chinese premier Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 Summit at the end of the month in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Free traders inside the administration are hoping the bilateral talks forestall another round of tariffs and set up future negotiations.\n\nBut there is a raging battle going on inside the West Wing with Navarro trying to tamp down hopes for the talks and free-trade voices including Kudlow sounding hopeful. The fear among the free traders is that another big round of tariffs will drive up consumer prices, further impede American exporters \u2013 especially farmers \u2013 and slow down economic growth. Higher prices caused by tariffs could also push the Federal Reserve into more aggressive interest rate hikes to fight inflation.\n\nFIRST LOOK: FREEDOM PARTNERS PRESS TRUMP/XI \u2014 In a letter going out this a.m., Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners, and The LIBRE Initiative press Trump and Xi to make progress at the G-20: \u201cThere is great urgency for the United States and China to come together and reach an agreement to eliminate tariffs and protectionist trade policies. The continued escalation of tariffs has come at significant cost to the global economy.\n\n\u201cIt has harmed businesses, farmers, consumers, workers, and families worldwide, inflicting higher costs, lost jobs, and uncertainty. Fortunately, government leaders on both sides appear open to negotiations to drop tariffs in favor of a compromise that helps everyone.\u201d\n\nFHLB JOINGS PUSH TO REPLACE LIBOR \u2014 Our Victoria Guida: \u201cThe Federal Home Loan Banks on Tuesday became the latest major financial player to boost the effort to replace LIBOR, issuing $4 billion in debt tied to the Federal Reserve\u2019s new alternative rate.\n\n\u201cThe government-sponsored banks, which lend to thousands of financial institutions using funds raised by issuing debt, are hoping their move will add momentum to the push to wean the global economy off using the scandal-scarred London InterBank Offered Rate as a benchmark for interest rates.\u201d Read more.\n\nMORE WHITE HOUSE DRAMA\u2014 Our Christopher Cadelago and Nancy Cook on the latest in an unhappy White House: \u201cBottled-up hostility in \u2026 Trump\u2019s administration flowed to the surface Tuesday, in a remarkable 12-hour period following an awkward midterm d\u00e9tente and tense presidential trip to Paris that he\u2019s still seething over. \u2018It\u2019s like an episode of \u2018Maury,\u2019\u2019 one former Trump aide observed to POLITICO as the spectacle unfolded. \u2018The only thing that\u2019s missing is a paternity test.\u2019\n\n\u201cAt the White House, Trump appeared poised to dismiss Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, a source of personal frustration for months over what he views as weak leadership on border security and other enforcement policies he\u2019s sought to implement. The fresh round of backbiting and post-midterm turnover could also sweep out Trump\u2019s chief of staff John Kelly, a close Nielsen ally, and see him replaced with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers\u201d Read more.\n\nTRUMP RAGES AT THERESA MAY \u2014 WP\u2019s Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker: \u201cAs he jetted to Paris last Friday \u2026 Trump received a congratulatory phone call aboard Air Force One. British Prime Minister Theresa May was calling to celebrate the Republican Party\u2019s wins in the midterm elections \u2014 never mind that Democrats seized control of the House \u2014 but her appeal to the American president\u2019s vanity was met with an ornery outburst.\n\n\u201cTrump berated May for Britain not doing enough, in his assessment, to contain Iran. He questioned her over Brexit and complained about the trade deals he sees as unfair with European countries. May has endured Trump\u2019s churlish temper before, but still her aides were shaken by his especially foul mood, according to U.S. and European officials briefed on the conversation.\u201d Read more.\n\nTHE LIST OF THINGS ANGERING TRUMP \u2014 An incomplete tally: Markets are a mess; Growth appears to be slowing; Democrats now control the House and can investigate him; More House races continue to get called for Democrats and the GOP Senate performance looks less and less impressive; Rumors continue to swirl of potential Mueller indictments; Trump's Paris trip was widely panned as a disaster; His replacement Attorney General is mired in controversy; CNN is suing over the ouster of its reporter and looks likely to win.

Pelosi made a surprise appearance at the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u2019 freshman orientation Monday and held a reception Tuesday afternoon at an Italian restaurant by the D.C. waterfront. \u201cOn Wednesday, the members-elect will be introduced to their colleagues at a Democratic Caucus meeting, a lengthy process that will put them onstage with Pelosi,\u201d Bres, Rachael and Kyle report.\n\n\u201cThe California Democrat will follow that up with an appearance at the Congressional Black Caucus, a powerful faction inside the Democratic Caucus,\u201d they continue. \u201cThen, Pelosi will host a private dinner for members-elect and their spouses Wednesday evening in Statuary Hall, right off the House floor.\u201d Democratic Party luminaries, including former Vice President Al Gore, former Secretary of State John Kerry and Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, are making calls on Pelosi\u2019s behalf. Pelosi herself has also made calls -- and held private meetings -- to members-elect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the \u2018Pelosi for Speaker\u2019 blitz, with the California Democrat showing off every trick in her vast arsenal of persuasive tactics as she works to round up the votes she needs to win two upcoming votes: one inside the Democratic Caucus on Nov. 28, and the critical one on the House floor Jan. 3,\u201d they write. \u201cWhile Pelosi will easily get a majority inside the Democratic Caucus, how she handles that vote is crucial. Letting some members and members-elect vote against her so they can say they opposed her, for example, would then free them up to back her on the floor. That will set the stage for the run-up to the Jan. 3 vote, where the stakes will be far higher.\u201d More: https://politi.co/2RUgPvH\n\nRelated: \u201cNine Democrats want promises from Pelosi in exchange for speaker votes,\u201d by The Washington Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis: https://wapo.st/2TalScG ; and \u201cAnti-Pelosi Democrats Claim They Have Numbers to Block Her in Speaker Floor Vote,\u201d from Roll Call\u2019s Lindsey McPherson: http://bit.ly/2qL6Z3J\n\nHOYER HAS THE VOTES -- House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) has already clinched enough votes to become majority leader in the next Congress. \u201cDespite calls for new leadership, Hoyer has faced the least resistance among House Democrats\u2019 big three,\u201d Bres and I note. \u201cHe has the support of at least two-thirds of the incoming Democratic Caucus, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO.\u201d More than 150 Democrats announced their support for Hoyer in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter Tuesday afternoon, casting him as the best person for the job.

Trump believes Jordan would be a ferocious defender, and the Ohio Republican wants the post. \u201cBut McCarthy does not have authority to unilaterally appoint a lawmaker to any ranking member position,\u201d they note. \u201cRather, the decision is up to the Republican Steering Committee, a collection of members who do not like Jordan and may not take their cues from the White House.\u201d More: https://politi.co/2PuBHwQ\n\nRelated read: \u201cStung by election losses, House GOP weighs leadership choice,\u201d from The Associated Press\u2019 Lisa Mscaro: http://bit.ly/2PXwb5j\n\nSHUTDOWN WATCH -- The upcoming government funding fight will center on the president\u2019s border wall and special counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cDemocrats said Tuesday they might insist that language protecting Mueller\u2019s job security be included in a must-pass spending bill due by Dec. 7,\u201d Burgess reports. \u201cWith Mueller\u2019s probe on Russian interference in the 2016 election winding down and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) loath to bring up a standalone Mueller-protection bill, Democrats argue it could be their last chance to shield the special counsel from Trump.

In addition, the polling showed 87 percent of voters agreeing on the ability of incarcerated individuals to get credits for good behavior as well as engaging in training and treatment programs.\n\nCOMMITTEE SHUFFLE -- Grassley is mulling whether to stay atop the Judiciary Committee or chair the Finance Committee. His decision \u201cwill have significant ramifications for his colleagues and for Congress as a whole,\u201d Burgess writes. \u201cGrassley has long said he would make his decision immediately after the midterms, presumably to see who captured the majority.

Such primaries, they claim, benefit political parties while disenfranchising independent voters.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe lawsuit hinges on a specific \u201canti-donation\u201d clause of the New Mexico constitution. But supporters say the case, if successful, could have ramifications beyond New Mexico, serving as leverage to pressure lawmakers in other closed primary states.\n\n\u201cPoliticians, not surprisingly, are reluctant to change a system that they\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d said John Opdycke, president of Open Primaries. \u201cBy raising the basic premise that publicly funded elections should be open to everybody, I think can really help both in the courts, but also in legislatures, to create more momentum.\u201d\n\nThe issue rose to national prominence in 2016, when Bernie Sanders railed against closed primaries as an anti-democratic practice during his unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination. As he campaigned in the New York \u2014 a state with a closed primary \u2014Sanders argued that the practice was \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Though the court that year considered a challenge based on a different part of the state constitution, it nevertheless cast doubt on the argument that independent voters are disenfranchised.\n\nRegistering with a party, the court ruled at the time, \u201cis a reasonably modest burden that furthers the State\u2019s interest in securing the purity of elections and efficiently administering them.\u201d\n\nIn its current lawsuit, Open Primaries argues closed primaries constitute an unconstitutional donation to a private entity.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico\u2019s closed primary elections are exclusionary and held for the benefit of major political parties, which are purely private entities,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cEven though the primary election is closed and exclusionary, primary elections are paid for by public funds and New Mexico taxpayers, while the major political parties reap the benefits.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico is one of nine closed-primary states, while another seven states allow parties to determine whether unaffiliated voters may participate in their nominating contests, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nTwenty-eight states currently hold fully open primary elections or primaries in which unaffiliated voters may participate in any primary they choose, according to the NCSL.\n\n\u201cWhat we hope to bring with this case is renewed attention on how our primary election system in this country, which is often times run for the benefit of private organizations, has been publicly subsidized for years at the expense of the public,\u201d said Jeremy Gruber, senior vice president at Open Primaries. \u201cIf the parties are allowed to be gatekeepers and decide who can and can\u2019t participate, then these are not public elections for the purpose of public funding, and they should no longer be subsidized.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "smurray@politico.com (Stephanie Murray)", "title": "PRESSLEY\u2019S Instagram \u2014 MORSE makes 30 UNDER 30 list \u2014 What about 2022?", "description": null, "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/massachusetts-playbook/2018/11/14/congress-on-instagram-morse-makes-30-under-30-list-what-about-2022-345986", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:51:01Z", "content": "GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.

Up next, he says, is Holyoke's position in the marijuana industry.\n\nAnd as for running for higher office in the future, perhaps governor in four years, Morse says \"it's way too early to think about it.\" The Holyoke mayor was named as a potential 2022 candidate in a Boston Globe story Tuesday afternoon about some very, very early speculation. \"I don't know what the future holds.

Cory Booker, who sites on the committee, avoided questioning Matey on Christie administration scandals, leaving it entirely up to his Democratic colleagues (the only Republican at the hearing was committee Chairman Chuck Grassley). Booker just focused on the poor safety record of University Hospital in Newark, where Matey until recently served as a legal executive.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Booker\u2019s going to say \u2018Aye Matey!\u2019 if and when the nomination comes up for a vote. But if Christie comes before the same committee for his coveted cabinet post, Booker may have a harder time avoiding asking him pointed questions.

The speaker\u2018s efforts could be seen as a road to compromise between Gov. Phil Murphy and Senate President Steve Sweeney on an issue the three Democrats have long agreed was a top priority. During a sit-down interview with POLITICO this week, Coughlin declined to say whom he\u2019d exclude from his bill. But even if some some groups are left out, it doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t eventually see a boost in their pay, he said.

It was the first time that New Jersey has brought legal action against a company based in the state as it struggles to contain a spiraling opioid addiction crisis. And it comes at a time when state attorneys general across the country have intensified their efforts to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for the epidemics of abuse. Gurbir Grewal, the New Jersey attorney general, said the subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, minimized the risks of opioid addiction in its marketing messages, targeted older people and other patients with little knowledge of opioids and mounted a campaign to \u2018embed its deceptions about the viability of long-term opioid use in the minds of doctors and patients.\u2019\u201d Read more here\n\nCOOPER TRAUMA SURGEONS FINALLY GET THAT RAISE \u2014 Cooper Health raising its minimum wage to $15 for all workers, by POLITICO\u2019s Sam Sutton: Cooper University Health Care in Camden will raise the minimum wage it pays its workers to at least $15 an hour, a move that should result in wage gains for 10 percent of the system\u2019s workforce, or roughly 750 employees, Chairman George Norcross announced today.

Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, negotiated it, and the way they rolled it out to the world yesterday \u2014 emblematized a key feature of de Blasio\u2019s mayoralty: the often yawning chasm between his rhetoric and his actions.\n\nThe deal came together despite concerns from de Blasio\u2019s progressive allies, and despite his previous concern that behemoths like Amazon could destroy local stores. \u201cIf you\u2019re like me and you love your local neighborhood stores \u2014 your bakeries, your caf\u00e9, your clothing stores, all these things \u2014 then you need to spend your money there and not at Starbucks and not at other alternative places,\" de Blasio said last year.\n\nYesterday, he had something different to say.\n\n\u201cAmazon was going to have a second headquarters, and better it is us,\u201d de Blasio said. \"Better that a lot of that money ... will help us support small business and support neighborhoods. I feel really, really good about that.\"\n\nAnd the unabashedly pro-union mayor expects the best from the city's new tenants: \u201cAs to Amazon\u2019s much-criticized treatment of its lower-wage workers, de Blasio was optimistic that after imbibing New York City\u2019s special brew of union-friendliness, Amazon would change its ways,\u201d Dana and Gloria wrote yesterday.\n\n\u201cI would start by saying that I am happy Amazon will benefit from being in an environment that is pro-union and will start to see why this union town works so well,\u201d de Blasio said.\n\nDe Blasio and Cuomo agreed to make a secret end run around the City Council\u2019s sometimes cumbersome city planning process, to allay Amazon\u2019s concerns that local officials or City Council members could veto the project.\n\n\u201cYou have a democratically elected mayor and a democratically elected governor saying we had an unprecedented opportunity to add to the number of jobs in this city,\u201d de Blasio said, explaining his decision to simply bypass the city\u2019s typical process for building major projects. \u201cAnd we were not going to let that slip through our hands.\u201d\n\nAlmost three years ago, de Blasio signed a new law to cut noisy helicopter tourism traffic in the city in half, calling it \"a major quality of life issue.\" But the deal to land the Amazon headquarters includes a concession to help the company, headed by the country's richest man, build its own helipad. The deal would allow 120 helicopter landings a year, roughly one every three days.\n\nBefore the selection was announced, local elected officials wondered what Amazon would do for the surrounding community, home to the Queensbridge Houses \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest housing project and part of NYCHA, the crumbling home to more than 400,000 city residents. In the end, the stated terms of the deal include requirements that the trillion-dollar company provide some job training for Queensbridge residents, but do nothing to guarantee that those residents, many of whom are living at or below the poverty line, would fill any of the good-paying jobs the new headquarters will provide.\n\nDe Blasio, who once campaigned on the idea of ending \u201cthe tale of two cities,\u201d just marveled at the contrast:\n\n\"One of the biggest companies on earth next to the biggest public housing development in the United States \u2014 the synergy is going to be extraordinary,\" he said.\n\nIT\u2019S WEDNESDAY.

Amazon\u2019s interest was made known scarcely a week ago, yet brokers say they are already selling units\u2014sometimes sight-unseen\u2014via text message. Others are renting vans and packing them full of clients eager to view multiple buildings, or holding group tours in Chinese. Now, with Amazon\u2019s commitment to the New York City neighborhood, brokers are predicting the apartment market there will surge further..Up until last week, the Long Island City market had suffered from slowing sales and rising inventory. Now, some brokers say the sudden mood shift reminds them of the heady days of New York City\u2019s condo boom just before the housing market crashed during the 2008 financial crisis. \u2018This is the first time in my 20-year career that I have seen the market go from a buyer\u2019s market to a seller\u2019s market overnight, based on a rumor,\u2019 Mr. Smith said..\u201d Wall Street Journal\u2019s Josh Barbanel\n\n\u2014 The New York Times\u2019 Karen Weise and J.

The more than $1.5 billion in direct tax breaks and grants the state is offering Amazon to create jobs here \u2014 $48,000 a job \u2014 would be fine if this were 1978, not 2018. Back then, Gotham\u2019s biggest problem was the loss of hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, as companies and people fled a failing city.

It remains unclear what exactly the deal would entail.\n\n\u201cThe discussions between the president and McCarthy about Jordan, which took place last week, set off a round of speculation among lawmakers inside the Capitol that Trump may try to push Jordan to become the top Republican lawmaker on the House Judiciary Committee, a panel expected to launch an array of Democratic investigations against the president \u2014 and possibly even an impeachment probe.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- THE FREEDOM CAUCUS is all but dead at this point, and McCarthy is going to easily put away Jordan in this leadership race. But they are now viewing how McCarthy treats Jordan as a litmus test. The president has put McCarthy in quite a position by asking him to cut a deal with Jordan, and place him at the top of Judiciary. Insiders thought Jordan would\u2019ve been great at Oversight and Government Reform, where Jordan was next in line. Jordan has to jump Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) and Steve King (R-Iowa) to get to the top of Judiciary -- not a huge lift.\n\nBUT KEEP IN MIND that McCarthy doing anything to help the Freedom Caucus at this point is an internal struggle for the California Republican. There\u2019s a domino effect by putting Jordan at Judiciary: it seems very likely that MARK MEADOWS (R-N.C.) will make a run for his party\u2019s top slot at Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nTHIS WOULD PUT Jordan and Meadows -- two Freedom Caucus guys who have tormented the Republican leadership -- at the top of the two most critical investigative committees.\n\nCALIFORNIA REP. JEFF DENHAM, a close McCarthy ally, lost his Central Valley seat to Democrat Josh Harder yesterday. The California GOP delegation has been absolutely decimated.\n\nHappy Wednesday. SPOTTED: SEN.

Ms. Ricardel had announced the trip before it was fully planned, according to one of the people, and then threatened to pull resources for it after learning that she did not have a seat on Mrs. Trump\u2019s plane.\n\n\u201cAfter the trip ended, Ms. Ricardel made accusations of inappropriate behavior by Mrs. Trump\u2019s most trusted staff members, including Lindsay Reynolds, the first lady\u2019s chief of staff \u2014 claims that a person close to the first lady said were false.\n\n\u201cMrs. Trump then complained to John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, about Ms. Ricardel, and Mr. Kelly raised the issue with Mr. Bolton, two White House officials said. Mr. Kelly is theoretically Mr. Bolton\u2019s boss, but the national security adviser has so far refused to remove Ms. Ricardel, who was spotted in her office late Tuesday afternoon.\u201d NYT\n\n-- CAITLIN OPRYSKO and DANIEL LIPPMAN: \u201cRicardel, along with Bolton ... has \u2018a very closed style.

The state of Maryland on Tuesday filed the first legal challenge seeking to overturn Whitaker\u2019s appointment, while on Capitol Hill newly empowered House Democrats are already making plans to have the acting attorney general appear as one of their first witnesses when the next Congress launches in January.\n\n\u201cThe uproar over the appointment, which effectively removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as Mueller\u2019s primary supervisor, has put Whitaker in a difficult spot, trapped between setting off a political firestorm by clipping Mueller\u2019s wings and angering a president intent on having him do just that.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cWhitaker abandoned taxpayer-funded project in Iowa in 2016,\u201d by AP\u2019s Ryan Foley and David Pitt in Des Moines: \u201cWhile in private business, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker walked away from a taxpayer-subsidized apartment-rehabilitation project in Iowa after years of cost overruns, delays and other problems, public records show.\n\n\u201cThe city of Des Moines ultimately yanked an affordable housing loan that Whitaker\u2019s company had been awarded, and another lender began foreclosure proceedings after Whitaker defaulted on a separate loan for nearly $700,000.

He must be able to do two things at once: Stay on top of the key issues that have made him a leader of the \u201cState of Resistance\u201d against President Donald Trump while simultaneously establishing himself as a power broker in Sacramento who can manage a booming economy and $16 billion in surplus and \u201crainy day\u201d reserves as hungry Democrats push for new spending and initiatives.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs leader of the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy\u2014the state that\u2019s home to Silicon Valley, Hollywood and the nation\u2019s agricultural breadbasket, the vast Central Valley\u2014Newsom will automatically be catapulted into the ranks of future Democratic prospects for the White House. The political pressures of a party eager to unseat Trump may pit him, eventually, against fellow Californians like Sen. Kamala Harris and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.

Edmund \u201cPat\u201d Brown, who has known him since childhood.\n\nAnother is marshaling the sharp elbows Newsom honed in the mosh pit of local San Francisco politics, while forging his own governing style in Sacramento\u2014a town Newsom has never called home.\n\nWillie Brown advises Newsom to make an immediate departure from the press-adverse Jerry Brown and schedule weekly press conferences in Sacramento, both to improve his relations with the media and to dominate the headlines. That approach will be necessary \u201cto gain the same presence that Jerry had by birth,\u2019\u2019 Willie Brown said. \u201cNewsom will have to work for it.\u201d\n\nBrown noted that unlike his predecessor, Newsom isn\u2019t a creature at home in Sacramento\u2019s insular political cultural or statewide Democratic Party machine politics. A business owner and entrepreneur who has enjoyed the backing of the Getty oil family, Newsom has frequently been labeled a \u201cpro-business Democrat.\u201d Early in his political career, he even described himself as a \u201cdogmatic fiscal conservative and a social liberal\u2019\u2019\u2014a profile that has earned him barbs from the party\u2019s far left.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not part of the Democratic Party on a full-time basis. He\u2019s not part of organized labor on a full-time basis. He\u2019s not part of the business world on a full-time basis,\u201d Brown said. While \u201cthere will be all these wannabes\u201d crowding around to get into his circle, he said, \u201cthe lobbyist types will be disappointed. ... Newsom never performed in that way. He has paid no interest to them. But he\u2019s smart enough, and sharp enough, to have talented folks seek him out.\u201d\n\nIn the final days of his gubernatorial campaign, camped out in the back of his big blue campaign bus, Newsom acknowledged that he\u2019d told his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, he\u2019d been feeling \u201cbutterflies,\u201d a combination of exhilaration and a sobering gut check as the reality of that challenge set in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been such a long, multiyear journey,\u201d said a reflective Newsom in the waning hours of a dawn-to-dusk campaign barnstorm across California that would seal his win. And now, the reality is here: \u201cThere\u2019s an ending,\u2019 he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real responsibility. That\u2019s the job.\u201d\n\nNewsom acknowledged that it\u2019s daunting to be following Jerry Brown, a man who\u2019s \u201ca master\u201d of California political dialect, calling him \u201cexceptionally gifted, exceptionally skilled ... one of the best political minds of our generation.\u201d\n\nBut as much as Newsom respects Brown, he has little time to waste\u2014there\u2019s a preliminary budget due on Dec 15, though he won\u2019t be formally sworn in until Jan. 7. \u201cI just want to get to work,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cI\u2019m not going to wait around for the first 100 days ... these transitions are pretty quick.\u201d\n\nNewsom is approaching his first budget, which gets reviewed by the Legislature in May, the way he approaches everything else: with deadly earnestness. It\u2019s \u201cyour first chance at a first impression ... demonstrably a reflection of your values,\u201d he said. And for one who has talked about prioritizing issues like early childhood education, he noted, it will be seen as a \u201cproof point\u201d of his commitments.\n\nFor months, Newsom has been quietly assembling 30 policy teams\u2014experts in academia, tech, business and government; the groups have been examining the challenges ahead in issues ranging from health care and climate change to more granular topics like cybersecurity, job automation and government procurement. Those efforts have produced a series of in-depth policy papers.\n\nSo far, Newsom said, \u201cI\u2019ve been focusing on \u2018how.\u2019\u201d As the governor-elect, \u201cI think the next phase is \u2018who.\u2019 \u2026 You can make big mistakes in a transition\u2014and often they\u2019re attached to personnel.\u201d\n\nJason Kinney, a longtime Newsom adviser, resigned his spot at California Strategies, a powerhouse state lobbying firm, to help the former mayor navigate what he acknowledges will be critical decisions ahead.\n\nAnd Newsom\u2019s first major picks, two veteran women in politics, have already won praise. His chief of staff\u2014and the head of his transition team\u2014will be Ann O\u2019Leary, a former policy adviser to Hillary Clinton. And Ana Matosantos, who served as budget director to both Govs. Jerry Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger, will be his Cabinet secretary\u2014a key post that will serve as the new governor\u2019s chief contact to key government agencies and departments.\n\nFriends say Newsom, while seeking the advice and views of his trusted staffers, relishes the work of governing. He is known to read policy papers from the moment he wakes up, highlighting in yellow and crowding the margins with notes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been looking at these issues for a long time and he is so far ahead of most people coming into this office on a policy level\u2014because he really does love policy issues and he doesn\u2019t jump fast,\u201d said veteran Democratic consultant Gale Kaufman. \u201cHe\u2019s thoughtful in his approach.\u201d\n\nBill Whalen, a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution who was previously an adviser to Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, says the new job will require Newsom to tone down his national profile and go local. \u201cHe has to spend a lot of time talking to lawmakers, staying on top of bills, building relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cSacramento is a lot closer to Davis than to Davos. ... He has to take care of matters at home first.\u201d\n\nStill, Whalen says it\u2019s a good sign that Newsom is one of the few Democrats who in the past year has visited the conservative think tank, in part to explore the views of some of the nation\u2019s most preeminent economists and policy experts on the other side of the aisle. Many came away impressed with the depths of the discussion, he said.\n\nSuch efforts may assist Newsom in a big challenge ahead, Whalen suggests: controlling the pent-up spending demands of California\u2019s Democratic state Legislature, which chafed under Jerry Brown\u2019s trademark frugality and fiscal discipline.\n\n\u201cJerry has been the \u2018alpha dog\u2019 in Sacramento for the last eight years,\u201d pushing back on budget demands with tough vetoes \u2014 an approach that has helped Brown protect a budget that went from deficit to surplus on his watch. Says Whelan, \u201cCan a Gov. Newsom be the same big dog? Are the Democratic leaders of the legislature intimidated by Gavin Newsom or not?\u201d\n\nAssembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, at Newsom\u2019s victory party last week, noted Newsom\u2019s statements that he would not be \u201cprofligate\u201d and would try to follow in Jerry Brown\u2019s footsteps by keeping the Legislature in check when needed. \u201cThat\u2019s the governor\u2019s job\u2014to say no to us sometimes,\u201d he said, adding a pointed warning: \u201cAnd it\u2019s our job to say no to the governor sometimes. ... It\u2019s a balance of power. And I know that Gavin Newsom understands that.\u2019\u2019\n\nDemocrats who\u2019ve known him for years say Newsom won\u2019t have a problem saying no.\n\nThe former San Francisco mayor, during his tenure as the city\u2019s chief executive, gained an understanding of \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to veto legislation that pisses off your friends,\u201d said a longtime friend and adviser, Nathan Ballard, CEO of The Press Shop, a Bay Area media-strategy group run in partnership with veteran Democratic strategist P.J. Johnston.\n\nBut Newsom is also likely to carve out his own signature issues where he goes further than his predecessors. Former state Sen. Fran Pavley, who helped craft a landmark climate-change bill signed by Schwarzenegger, which mandated a cap on greenhouse gas emissions statewide and a 25 percent reduction by 2020, says she sees Newsom already looking ahead on how to advance the environmental agenda forged by Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown.\n\nPavley says she\u2019s both energized and reassured by the news that Mary Nichols, who heads the California Air Resources Board\u2014and has been a key in resisting Trump\u2019s agenda aiming to roll back fuel emissions standards\u2014will stay on through at least 2020, when her current term ends. Nichols, who\u2019s been dubbed the state\u2019s \u201cclean air czar,\u2019\u2019 served as chair of the board under Schwarzenegger and has been widely viewed for decades as the most influential force behind the state\u2019s successful moves to dramatically reduce air pollution\u2014while advancing a cutting-edge climate change agenda. She says Newsom is strongly rumored to be preparing to address the issue of fracking\u2014representing a key departure from Brown, whose continued support made him the target of environmental groups.\n\nIt may be one of the areas where Newsom will immediately be challenged to make an early and bold, game-changing stroke\u2014much as he did in 2004 as a new mayor by legalizing same sex-marriage in San Francisco, says Willie Brown.\n\nThat decision put him on the national political map\u2014and sparked a national uproar. Republicans lambasted Newsom, as did some Democrats, like Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and many more\u2014like then-Sen. Barack Obama \u2014 declined to have photos taken with him in the immediate aftermath. Pundits predicted the end of his political career, but it was Newsom\u2019s prediction that marriage equality would be the law of the land someday \u2014 \u201cwhether you like it or not,\u201d he said \u2014 that turned out to be spot-on.\n\nBut Newsom cautions that recreating that \u201clightning in a bottle\u201d moment will be \u201ctough.\u201d He adds: \u201cThat issue chose me, I didn\u2019t choose it.\u201d\n\nBut even as he sought to tamp down expectations, Newsom noted that his campaign slogan was \u201cCourage, for a Change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to be surprised with what they\u2019re getting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying courage is always noble and righteous\u2014but it\u2019s an expression of a willingness to lean into issues\u201d when others \u201cmay be a little more reticent to do so.\u201d\n\nCarla Marinucci is a reporter."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "bwhite@politico.com (Ben White)", "title": "How the China trade war could get very bad, very fast", "description": "Consumers have not yet felt a major hit from President Donald Trump\u2019s trade battle with China.

And Trump thinks Jordan would be a ferocious defender.\n\nBut McCarthy does not have authority to unilaterally appoint a lawmaker to any ranking member position. Rather, the decision is up to the Republican Steering Committee, a collection of members who do not like Jordan and may not take their cues from the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s request puts McCarthy in a bind as he prepares to succeed Paul Ryan atop the GOP conference, which was crushed by Democrats on Election Day. Jordan derailed McCarthy\u2019s 2015 speakership bid and has been running against the California Republican to lead the House GOP for months. Jordan accused McCarthy, along with other GOP leaders, of losing the majority for Republicans.\n\nJordan is backed by an array of conservative special interest groups who have long been a thorn in leadership\u2019s side, and he also has the ear of the president. But Jordan has little chance of winning the minority leader race.\n\nThe California Republican does not need to strike a deal with Jordan to win the position. McCarthy says he has the votes. And in fact, his allies believe McCarthy benefits if he can show the president that he can defeat Jordan in what\u2019s effectively a popularity contest.\n\nThe vote for minority leader is set for Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJordan and McCarthy both declined to comment for this story. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe rare and unexpected presidential foray into internal House politics could scramble what, until now, had been a fairly low-key fight over the position. Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) is the leading contender to become the ranking Republican on Judiciary \u2014 though Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), a veteran of the Clinton impeachment battle, is also running.\n\nIndeed, the request could put McCarthy in a sensitive situation with some of his members. McCarthy is close with Collins, who is favored for the position and well-liked among his colleagues. Collins has been campaigning for the post for months, flying around the country to help GOP colleagues win re-election, crafting bipartisan bills to showcase his legislative chops \u2014 including a prison reform bill that is important to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 and wooing House leaders.\n\nBut Jordan has won the president\u2019s admiration in no small part because he\u2019s good on TV and is a fierce advocate of the president. Jordan appears regularly on Fox News and other networks to push the pro-Trump line. And the President has gushed that he\u2019s his \u201cwarrior\u201d \u2014 often to the annoyance of other House Republicans.\n\nSome Republicans have suggested there is a way to make all parties happy. Jordan is next in line on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, where Democrats are also readying a series of investigations into Trump and his administration. Jordan, who wanted the position in previous years, could be tapped to be the top GOP member on the committee, the Republicans say.\n\nBut it\u2019s possible Jordan loses out being the ranking Republican on either committee given his unpopularity in the GOP conference for tactics many considered divisive. Jordan espouses a hardline conservative agenda at every opportunity, has pushed for shutdowns and has derailed some of his colleagues\u2019 bipartisan legislative priorities in the name of ideological purity.\n\nHe may need McCarthy\u2019s or Trump\u2019s backing to get either job. McCarthy, as minority leader, has four votes on the Steering Committee.\n\nIt\u2019s an awkward situation for Trump as well as for McCarthy. Trump clearly likes both men, calling McCarthy to talk shop regularly while praising Jordan as well. The two House Republicans, however, have long butted heads.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee is likely to be the forum for the most high-profile investigations Trump will face in the Democratic Congress next year. The panel has a wide-ranging portfolio, and Democrats have signaled they'll use it to look at Trump's potential business conflicts of interest, his decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, allegations that Trump may have obstructed an investigation into his campaign's contacts with Russia and other sensitive matters.\n\nThe panel also has jurisdiction over the impeachment process, which could become a factor if special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation delivers allegations of misconduct. Dozens of Democrats already voted to advance an impeachment debate late last year, although they were in the minority and the vote was guaranteed to fail.\n\nDuring the final days of the campaign, Trump warned that a Democratic House would try to impeach him and used it as a rallying cry to his supporters. While Democrats have downplayed the possibility of impeachment, Trump\u2019s request underscores his intense focus on who will be leading the fight against Democratic investigations into his presidency.\n\nJordan, for his part, has slammed the long-running Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, accusing leaders of the FBI and Justice Department of anti-Trump bias that he said fueled their probe.\n\nDemocrats say Jordan and his supporters are trying to shield Trump from a legitimate investigation, in part by eroding public confidence in law enforcement institutions. Trump has fanned the controversy, often taking to Twitter to pan the Russia probe as a \"witch hunt\" against him.\n\nThe Judiciary committee\u2019s portfolio will include far more than investigations. Some of Trump's signature policy issues \u2014 including immigration \u2014 are overseen by the committee. Gun control legislation is also on the committee's docket, along with prison and sentencing issues, all of which Trump has weighed in on during his first two years in office.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Jenny Ament", "title": "'You fall in love with it': Kim Davis on hockey and her career in the NHL", "description": "Davis had a career in finance before making a leap to sports", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/kim-davis-nhl-hockey-career-987655", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/9f/ca/4161b3544034b7f9c1a0f2ed1274/181113-kim-davis-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T10:05:33Z", "content": "Jenny Ament/POLITICO Subscribe to Women Rule on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Stitcher here.

He did, however, emphasize the importance of a House vote on an option to buy into Medicare.\n\n\"Medicare for all, single payer, is the ceiling that a sizable number believe in, but not everyone is there yet,\" Green said in an interview, describing a Medicare option as a \"floor\" for the party's health care debate. \"At a minimum, we should be projecting that very strong floor to voters, not small-bore, technocratic tweaks\" to Obamacare.\n\nGreen wasn't alone in acknowledging that ambitious progressive goals like Medicare for all have yet to get broad buy-in from Democrats.\n\nIndivisible, the liberal network that gave the party\u2019s candidates valuable grass-roots support during the midterms, released a revamped edition of its popular guide for citizen-activists on Tuesday night that embraces a sense of pragmatism.\n\nIndivisible proposes a two-part \u201clegislative offense\u201d strategy to nudge the party forward: passing \u201cmessaging bills\u201d that spell out a compelling progressive agenda even if they won\u2019t be signed into law, and leveraging \u201cmust-pass bills\u201d to extract occasional wins from GOP senators.\n\n\u201cWe can safely assume that the vast majority of good legislation passed in the House will die in the Republican-controlled Senate,\u201d the former House Democratic aides who founded Indivisible write in the network's new guide. \u201cPlus, we would still need Donald Trump to sign any bill that clears Congress in order for it to become law.\u201d\n\nAnti-Trump groups also appear willing to give the House Democratic majority some space on the legislative front because they know their allies on Capitol Hill can hobble the White House through a litany of investigations. More than a half-dozen prospective committee chairs are sitting members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, its leaders noted at a news conference Monday.\n\n\u201cThere are two big prongs Democrats can pursue. One is resolute oversight and accountability of this administration to uncover lawless behavior and hold officials to account for abusing the public\u2019s trust,\u201d MoveOn.org\u2019s Washington director, Ben Wikler, said in an interview. \u201cThe second is passing unapologetically progressive measures that show the public what Democrats would do if they actually had power, particularly on issues like drug prices or minimum wage or infrastructure.\u201d\n\nNotably, Wikler didn\u2019t mention single-payer health care. Many prominent Democrats have endorsed Medicare for all, including multiple potential 2020 presidential hopefuls, but the party's candidates didn't necessarily embrace the issue in swing districts that proved critical to its new House majority. And Republicans are already working to turn the costly plan into a weapon against Democrats ahead of the 2020 campaign.\n\nNeera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, noted in an interview that \"who supported [Obamacare] and who opposed it was a resonant issue\" in multiple battleground races, rather than Medicare for all.\n\n\"A lot of what people were voting for was a check on Donald Trump,\" Tanden added.\n\nTo that end, an entire section of the new Indivisible guide is devoted to deterring Democrats from the \"dangerous\" appetite to cut deals with Trump and the GOP.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made an early appeal on that front Tuesday in a Fox News op-ed that touted \"opportunities\" to work together on bipartisan legislation next year.\n\n\"What we can make of those opportunities will depend on our Democratic colleagues,\" McConnell wrote. \"Will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? Or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference?\"\n\nWorking with the GOP will be necessary if Democrats hope to get Trump's signature on an infrastructure package or prescription drugs legislation \u2014 two items often discussed as potential areas of agreement between the president and the new House majority next year. But progressive activists, even if they're not making big demands of leadership to tack left, are warning Democrats that reaching across the aisle isn't the best way to make their case to voters ahead of 2020.\n\n\"We\u2019re asking the American public to give us power. It\u2019s more about projecting what we would do with it than expecting that we would do something with Donald Trump and Senate Republicans,\" said PCCC\u2019s Green.\n\nAnd even as some high-profile liberal groups aren't issuing a list of demands, others on the left are putting Democrats on notice that they'll want quick movement next year.\n\n\"We think we should be reminding them of what progressives expect and pushing leadership to make room for folks who came in on that to lead on those issues,\" Heidi Hess, co-director of the left-leaning advocacy group CREDO Action, said in an interview. \"So, yes, we\u2019re going to push, not just on Medicare for all, but across the board.\""}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Nahal Toosi", "title": "Trump taps ex-general for ambassador to Saudi Arabia", "description": "In recent months, the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been unusually turbulent.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/13/saudi-arabia-us-ambassador-trump-white-house-989736", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/05/c3/0be20027498fa04da9ade3661956/181113-johnabizaid-getty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T02:39:22Z", "content": "Trumps pick for ambassador to Saudi Arabia is John Abizaid, a retired four-star general who oversaw U.S. Central Command. | Win McNamee/Getty Images President Donald Trump intends to nominate a prominent former army general to fill the vacant role of U.S. amb\u2026 [+2440 chars]", "fulltext": "Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador to Saudi Arabia is John Abizaid, a retired four-star general who oversaw U.S. Central Command. | Win McNamee/Getty Images White House Trump taps ex-general for ambassador to Saudi Arabia\n\nPresident Donald Trump intends to nominate a prominent former army general to fill the vacant role of U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, a decision that comes nearly two years into his presidency and amid tensions with Riyadh.\n\nTrump\u2019s pick is John Abizaid, a retired four-star general who oversaw U.S. Central Command, a division that deals with the Middle East, according to a statement issued by the White House on Tuesday.

Saudi Arabia is a major producer of oil and a key American ally against Iran. But it is also a deeply conservative Muslim-majority country with a troubling record on human rights and religious extremism.\n\nIn recent months, the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been unusually turbulent. While Trump has gone out of his way to secure Saudi favor, U.S. lawmakers have grown increasingly wary of Saudi actions in Yemen, where fighting has led to dire humanitarian conditions.\n\nThe killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, last month has also badly strained relations. Khashoggi was a dissident Saudi who was living in the United States.

The state of Maryland on Tuesday filed the first legal challenge seeking to overturn Whitaker\u2019s appointment, while on Capitol Hill newly empowered House Democrats are already making plans to have the acting attorney general appear as one of their first witnesses when the next Congress launches in January.\n\nThe uproar over the appointment, which effectively removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as Mueller\u2019s primary supervisor, has put Whitaker in a difficult spot, trapped between setting off a political firestorm by clipping Mueller\u2019s wings and angering a president intent on having him do just that.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s Justice Department is wavering about whether Whitaker will do the deed the president wanted him for.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

With Mueller, it\u2019s such a politically fraught field, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to do anything than try to move it along.\u201d\n\nLanny Davis, the former Bill Clinton White House crisis manager, said that if Whitaker were to follow the president\u2019s wishes and meddle with the Mueller probe, he would be susceptible both to legal fallout and long-term reputational problems.\n\n\u201cThis guy is vulnerable criminally. He\u2019s vulnerable morally. He\u2019s just plain out vulnerable,\u201d said Davis, who is now representing Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen in his criminal proceedings.\n\nThere is also the fact that Mueller\u2019s investigation may be too far along to merely smother it. A Washington-based defense lawyer representing a senior Trump official in the Russia investigation said Whitaker couldn\u2019t make decisions \u201cbased on his seat-of-the-pants preferences.\u201d\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s work is now into its 18th month and includes guilty pleas involving former senior Trump aides and indictments against more than two dozen Russian officials accused of sabotaging the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) told POLITICO on Tuesday: \u201cTo try to stop it when it\u2019s nearly concluded would be a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe new constraints on Whitaker represent a harsh reality check for a White House that helped kick-start his promotion back in August 2017. That\u2019s when the White House counsel at the time, Don McGahn, pressured Sessions into hiring the little-known attorney as his new chief of staff, replacing Jody Hunt, who had just left to run the Justice Department\u2019s civil division.\n\nSessions, stung just weeks before by a series of humiliating Trump tweets , came away from his interactions with McGahn with an impression that he had little choice but to accede to the White House\u2019s demands, according to two sources familiar with Sessions\u2019 thinking.\n\nWhitaker had others pushing for his hiring, too.\n\nThe Federalist Society\u2019s executive director, Leonard Leo, whose stock has been high in the Trump White House for his behind-the-scenes vetting of potential Supreme Court picks, recommended Whitaker to McGahn.\n\nTrump also liked Whitaker\u2019s cable television appearances and his attack-dog style challenging Mueller\u2019s investigation. While working for Sessions, Whitaker used his post to engender the president\u2019s belief that Trump had a friend in him. The two men also bonded over football \u2014 Whitaker was a tight end on the University of Iowa team that went to the 1991 Rose Bowl.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s promotion has been anything but smooth. Trump last Friday told reporters outside the White House that he didn\u2019t even know the new acting attorney general, though in an Oct. 11 interview on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d the president called him a \u201cgreat guy,\u201d adding, \u201cI mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\u201d\n\nSome of the president\u2019s own aides, including members of his legal team, expressed frustration on Monday that neither the White House nor the Justice Department had made any attempt to put an end to the controversy generated by Whitaker\u2019s appointment by issuing a statement about Whitaker\u2019s views on the Mueller probe or his role overseeing it \u2014 making clear he had no intention of curtailing it or providing some window into his thinking.\n\nOthers said that although they believed it was unlikely Whitaker would take aim at Mueller, issuing a public statement saying as much would infuriate the president, who would view it as a betrayal akin to Sessions\u2019 initial recusal from the investigation in early 2017.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\nBut Whitaker\u2019s appointment has created anything but certainty for Trump and the Russia investigation.\n\nThe Maryland motion on Tuesday asking a federal judge to name Rosenstein the acting attorney general argues that Whitaker\u2019s promotion violates a constitutional provision requiring Senate confirmation for top positions like attorney general.\n\nSenate Democrats have said they\u2019re considering their own lawsuit, and the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), has already promised to make Whitaker the first witness when the new Congress convenes in January.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s totally unqualified,\u201d Nadler told CNN on Sunday. \u201cAnd his only qualification seems to be that he wants to be \u2014 that the president wants him to be the hatchet man to destroy the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nThe shakeup at Justice is also creating internal demands on its own lawyers.\n\nThe department on Tuesday was reportedly expected to finalize a legal opinion backing Whitaker\u2019s appointment.\n\nMueller\u2019s office faces its own deadline next Monday to tell a federal appellate court panel what the changes atop the department mean for a lawsuit that seeks to knock the special counsel out of his job on constitutional grounds.\n\nNadler on Tuesday also sent a letter to Whitaker and FBI Director Christopher Wray seeking responses to more than 100 information requests from Democratic lawmakers that have gone unanswered while the party has been in the House minority, including details about \u201cimproper communications\u201d between the White House and Justice Department.\n\nAnd Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the minority leader, made clear on Tuesday the position of Senate Democrats: There are \u201cserious questions,\u201d he said, about whether Whitaker\u2019s appointment \u2014 rather than that of the special counsel \u2014 is constitutional.\n\nBurgess Everett contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "eschor@politico.com (Elana Schor)", "title": "Kyl: No decision on how long to serve in Senate", "description": "The Arizona Republican also praised Martha McSally, who fell short in her own Senate bid.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/13/jon-kyl-senate-989697", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/9b/a5/7a62ef4745c5b4c6337b089c50c0/181113-jon-kyl-gtty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:46:52Z", "content": "When Sen.

But CNN has likely now claimed the advantage by moving the battle to the courtroom.\n\nFirst Amendment lawyers say courts have a history of defending access for journalists, and the White House\u2019s shifting justifications won\u2019t help it in the coming legal fight over the decision to revoke correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass last week. CNN and Acosta filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to have his credentials restored, and a judge has scheduled the first hearing for Wednesday afternoon.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious claim,\u201d said Floyd Abrams, the renowned First Amendment lawyer who represented The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that is likely to lead to a victory for the White House.\u201d\n\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAbrams said there have been a handful of cases over the years in which government officials have sought to bar reporters from public places where access can be restricted, such as courtrooms. He said that in all of those cases, including one from 1977 involving a reporter seeking a White House pass, judges have ruled on the side of journalists.\n\n\u201cThe core principles are you can\u2019t deny access because you disagree with the views expressed in the questions,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny access because you wish to retaliate for past questions.\u201d\n\nThe CNN case is likely to hinge on that very issue: whether Judge Timothy J. Kelly, appointed by Trump in 2017, believes the White House\u2019s claims that it did not strip Acosta of his pass because of objections to his coverage, but for other reasons that could be deemed permissible, such as security concerns.\n\nInitially, Sanders accused Acosta of \u201cplacing his hands on\u201d a White House aide during a news conference, though the contact appeared incidental on video replays. But Trump later stepped on that argument when he said the incident wasn\u2019t \u201coverly \u2026 horrible\u201d and indicated that his real issue with Acosta was a lack of \u201crespect\u201d for the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a statement responding to CNN\u2019s suit, Sanders shifted focus again, saying the issue was that Acosta \u201cphysically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions.\u201d She added, \u201cThis was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional,\u201d she said.\n\nThe government has yet to file any official response to the lawsuit. Per an order from Kelly, the response is due at 11 a.m. Wednesday. But the shifting explanations for why Acosta lost his access could indicate to the judge that these explanations are covers for the true rationale \u2014 that the administration simply didn\u2019t like his coverage or style, said Nathan Siegel, a First Amendment lawyer with Davis Wright Tremaine who previously served as in-house counsel for ABC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely relevant,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cThe fact that the defendants\u2019 explanation shifts is often evidence that it\u2019s a pretext for the real reason.\u201d\n\nAbrams agreed that CNN\u2019s lawyers could exploit this sort of opening, as did Harvard Law School First Amendment professor Rebecca Tushnet, who said, \u201cThe fact that the government\u2019s story keeps changing might raise red flags.\u201d\n\nEugene Volokh, a professor at the UCLA School of Law focused on the First Amendment, agreed that the network is in a strong position. \u201cCNN probably has enough there to argue that the decision to exclude him was based on his viewpoint and not just on supposedly mistreating the intern or hogging the mic,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there needs to be a determination of what the motivation was, and the case should go forward to get that determination.\u201d\n\nThe case could create even more legal headaches for a president already facing a mountain of them. In addition to the Mueller investigation, Trump is embroiled in lawsuits related to his business and other activities before he reached the White House, as well as challenges to his immigration policies. Both he and his top lieutenants \u2014 in addition to Sanders, chief of staff John Kelly, deputy chief of staff Bill Shine and Secret Service director Randolph Alles are also named in the suit \u2014 could be asked for records, like their emails, or deposed as part of the CNN case, lawyers said.\n\nTrump's public comments have complicated his legal fights before. In courtroom arguments over the administration's ban on travel to the U.S. from certain countries, opposing lawyers argued that his tweets about Muslims showed the real motivation behind his policy decisions.\n\nTrump has repeatedly singled out CNN for criticism as he complains about his media coverage. Even before he took office, he dubbed Acosta \"fake news\" during a press conference and refused to take a question from him. But revoking a reporter's press credentials was considered by the White House press corps a dramatic escalation and virtually unheard-of step.\n\nIn the lawsuit, CNN and Acosta advance two main arguments for restoring his credentials. First, they say the White House revoked the reporter\u2019s pass because of his coverage and viewpoint, and not for any of its other stated reasons. Second, they say the White House failed to follow the prescribed process for withdrawing a reporter\u2019s pass, as set out by a 1977 case in which Robert Sherrill, a reporter for The Nation, sued the Secret Service because it denied him access to the White House complex.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Sherrill\u2019s favor, declaring that the Secret Service must have a legitimate reason for barring a reporter and cannot do it \"arbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons.\"\n\nTo ensure that such reasons existed in the future, the court laid out a series of steps that administrations must go through \u2014 including giving reporters written notice and a chance to present their own argument \u2014 before denying a press pass.\n\nIn the complaint filed Tuesday, CNN and Acosta said that they were given no warning of or chance to reply to the decision to pull his pass.\n\nCNN is pushing for the court to restore Acosta's access quickly while it weighs the larger questions in the case.

While it didn\u2019t elaborate, The Wall Street Journal reported that the president had decided to fire Ricardel at Melania Trump's urging after clashes regarding her recent solo trip to Africa.\n\nAnd earlier in the day, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, lashed out at White House trade adviser Peter Navarro after Navarro, a trade protectionist, took aim at Wall Street and corporate influencers pushing a less aggressive stance against China. Navarro did Trump a \u201cgreat disservice,\u201d Kudlow told CNBC.\n\n\u201cPeter very badly misspoke,\u201d he added. \u201cHe was freelancing.\u201d\n\nWhite House aides and advisers have long anticipated an internal staff reckoning once the uneasy truce broke and the dust settled after the elections. But some conceded that the drumbeat of exits, the threat of subpoenas from the Russia probe and anticipated investigations by a newly empowered Democratic House \u2014 along with a raft of negative media attention in recent days \u2014 were taking a heavy toll on not only the president, but also on the aides and advisers' thinning ranks.\n\nTrump himself did not tip his hand on any of the higher-ranking staff moves. But at a diya-lighting ceremony in the White House commemorating the Hindu festival Diwali, he announced the nomination of Neomi Rao, an administrator with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, to fill the vacancy left in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals by Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s move to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn private and on Twitter, Trump succumbed to darker forces, fixating on the media as late midterm returns continued to tilt in favor of Democrats, bolstering their House majority and making what seemed on election night like a history-defying achievement for the president and Senate Republicans a decidedly routine showing.\n\nTrump has kept a light public schedule while stewing over unflattering domestic and international headlines, all amid a First Amendment-focused lawsuit that CNN filed against the president and top administration officials on Tuesday demanding that its correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s access to the White House be restored.\n\nThe internal upheaval came on the heels of Trump\u2019s trip to Paris, where European leaders distanced themselves from his rhetoric and President Emmanuel Macron of France implicitly rebuked Trump in front of 70 other world leaders during an Armistice Day ceremony by criticizing the very idea of nationalism.\n\nAlready dismissive of Trump, Parisians barely paid attention to the U.S. president during his visit except to mock him. Two French tabloids over the weekend ran cover photos of Trump along with the headlines: \u201cWhy Trump threatens us\u201d and \u201cMacron\u2019s other front.\u201d\n\nThe fallout from the Paris trip clearly remains on Trump\u2019s mind, since he tweeted five times on Tuesday morning about Macron, trade with France and his own canceled trip to an American cemetery outside Paris because of overcast, rainy weather.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter . \u201cHe was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!........\u201d\n\nHe blamed the Secret Service for the cancellation of the cemetery visit \u2014 contradicting what his press secretary told reporters over the weekend, that Trump himself did not want to cause a traffic jam.\n\nBut it was the staff machinations that consumed Trump\u2019s orbit, where advisers noted that with a fast-moving and fickle president, few things are certain.\n\nAyers, who is 36 and has three young children, has weighed returning to the private sector in Georgia, where he\u2019s held on to his house. There have also been discussions about moving him to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nNielsen\u2019s pending exit, meantime, seemed as close to a done deal as could be described. One Republican close to the White House characterized her departure as \u201cimminent\u201d \u2014 within the next week or two \u2014 and indicated that once her firing or resignation is announced, she will leave the administration within hours or days, similar to the recent firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nNielsen has clashed with the administration\u2019s hard-line immigration hawks, including Stephen Miller and staffers throughout DHS and the Justice Department. They have been critical of her inability to stem the ongoing flow of immigrants into the U.S., as well as her defense of the administration\u2019s decision to separate migrant parents from children when she appeared at the lectern during a news briefing.\n\n\u201cThere is no love lost between Nielsen and other political appointees,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that has advocated for far stricter immigration laws. \u201cShe and some of her staff have been considered more of an obstacle than a help.\u201d\n\nTrump is considering Thomas Homan, former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to succeed her, POLITICO reported. Other possible replacements include Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and David Pekoske, administrator of the Transportation Security Administration. Another name in the mix is Maj. Gen. Vincent Coglianese, who runs the Marine Corps Installations Command.\n\nInterpersonal conflicts have dogged Ricardel, the deputy national security adviser, since the days of the Trump transition, when she wanted the job of undersecretary for policy at the Defense Department, only to have Secretary Jim Mattis block her, a former transition official said. Eventually, Ricardel gave up landing a job at the Pentagon and found a spot at the Department of Commerce, for which the Senate confirmed her. Then, when Bolton took over as national security adviser, he brought her over to the White House as his No. 2. Her potential departure will be a political boon to Mattis and his team, the transition official added.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has been so consistently off the rails that days like today just blend into everything else,\u201d another former White House official concluded. \u201cThat in and of itself may be the biggest indictment of all.\u201d\n\nAndrew Restuccia, Eliana Johnson, Ben Schreckinger, Gabby Orr, Daniel Lippman and Ted Hesson contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "soverly@politico.com (Steven Overly)", "title": "Amazon\u2019s enemies swarm as its D.C. clout swells", "description": "Bezos\u2019 presence in Northern Virginia and New York will enhance his company\u2019s sway.

But Amazon is increasingly drawing attacks from critics and rivals.\n\nAmazon\u2019s triumphant announcement Tuesday of its moves into the Beltway and New York City called attention to an uncomfortable truth: The online juggernaut has fast become one of Washington\u2019s most-scorned companies.\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019 company has soared as it has expanded into far-flung corners of the economy, from retail, drones and Hollywood movies to cloud computing and facial recognition \u2014 underscored by the billions of dollars in incentives that Virginia and New York agreed to lavish on Amazon to lure its two new headquarters sites.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut its growing influence and power have also made it the target of lawmakers, regulators, labor unions and corporate rivals like Walmart, and even President Donald Trump himself.\n\nThat quickly became apparent as critics slammed the proposed taxpayer subsidies for Amazon \u2014 voiced first by one of the Democratic Party\u2019s rising liberal stars, New York Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who decried the \"race-to-the-bottom competition\" for corporate favors, and then by scholars at George Mason University's libertarian Mercatus Center, who wrote that the winning communities are most likely \"throwing their money away.\"\n\nThe bipartisan range of negative reactions is no accident, said Matt Stoller, policy director at the nonprofit Open Markets Institute, even as praise for the headquarters selection poured in from elected leaders in both regions.\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\u201cThe reason Amazon is getting so big is that it is just so predatory,\" Stoller said. \"And it\u2019s the predatory aspects of it that are causing people to react against it.\"\n\nAmazon did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAmazon still has plenty of fans among U.S. consumers: A survey last year ranked it the most trusted big tech company, and an estimated half of American households have memberships in its premium Prime service.\n\nYet its challenges in Washington just start with the man in the White House, who has threatened antitrust action against Amazon and accused it \u2014 without offering evidence \u2014 of unfairly profiting off the U.S. Postal Service. Trump also regularly rages at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers are seeking an investigation into the company\u2019s connections at the Defense Department, where Amazon is competing for a $10 billion Pentagon contract that would add to its already-massive cloud computing empire. Progressive lawmakers and labor unions have taken aim at the company over workplace safety, employee pay and, indeed, government-subsidized expansions. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) weighed in earlier this year with the BEZOS Act, a bill that would tax corporations for every dollar their low-wage workers receive in government assistance.\n\nAll this comes as the company's fortunes increasingly depend on decisions in Washington: Amazon is still awaiting federal approval to use drones to deliver packages, nearly five years after Bezos announced its plans on \"60 Minutes,\" for example. At the same time, Bezos\u2019 separate company Blue Origin is seeking a role in the president\u2019s push for an American renaissance in space.\n\nAmazon\u2019s industry rivals have weighed in, too. The clothing and footwear lobby wants Amazon declared a \u201cnotorious marketplace\u201d that traffics in counterfeits. Pharmacy companies, big retailers like Walmart and small merchants are all sounding warnings about what they consider predatory practices. The company also has alarmed UPS and FedEx as it lays the groundwork for its own logistics network that could compete with their package delivery services.\n\nAn association of small e-tailers, the Online Merchants Guild, is organizing to fight Amazon in California state court. The group\u2019s first action will be a lawsuit challenging tax collection practices that benefit Amazon and hurt its small sellers, guild founder Paul Rafelson told POLITICO on Tuesday.\n\nEven WikiLeaks has gotten in on the anti-Amazon game, publishing in October a confidential document that purports to map the location of the company\u2019s data centers. For some, the \u201cAmazon atlas\u201d confirmed suspicions that the controversial Pentagon contract proposal was written with Amazon in mind.\n\nEven so, the company's new headquarters in Crystal City and Queens will bring thousands of new employees \u2014 read: voters \u2014 and give Amazon an opening to make new friends in powerful places. Those include some lawmakers with an eye on the 2020 presidential race. As a corporate citizen that employs thousands of constituents in those districts, Amazon will have their attention more than ever before.\n\nNew York is home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who sets the chamber\u2019s Democratic agenda, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a likely contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. In Virginia, Sen. Mark Warner is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee and a proponent of tighter oversight of the tech industry, an issue that will greatly affect Amazon.\n\nSome of those elected leaders were quick to offer praise for Amazon's choice Tuesday.\n\n\"We've seen that major investments like these can bring not only thousands of direct jobs but also lead to job growth in other industries,\" Warner said in a statement. \"As we welcome Amazon's new investment in Virginia, we must commit to implementing this announcement in a way that will benefit the whole region and all of the Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nIn the House, Amazon's Long Island City location will fall within the district of Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the top Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee. Democratic Rep. Don Beyer, the No. 2 Democrat on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, will be the company's representative from Virginia.\n\nAmazon employees also are likely to settle down in districts represented by New York Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, who is making a bid to lead the House Democratic Caucus, and Jerry Nadler, the presumed chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee antitrust hearings.\n\n\u201cThey're going to have a footprint in major areas that have big delegations and have tended to have more influential members,\" said Bruce Freed, president and co-founder of Center for Political Accountability, which advocates for transparency in corporate political spending. \"It means they're going to be much more sensitive to Amazon\u2019s interests or its needs.\"\n\nEven before HQ2 mania, Amazon\u2019s company\u2019s lobbying presence in Washington had expanded rapidly. The company spent $12.8 million to influence federal policy last year, a record it\u2019s on pace to smash again this year. That\u2019s an increase of more than 400 percent since 2012, when the company spent a modest $2.5 million on lobbying.\n\nThe company's policy portfolio has expanded along with its business interests, from entertainment and cloud computing to groceries and self-driving cars. Its traditional e-commerce issues \u2014 online sales tax, electronic payments and data privacy \u2014 have been joined over time by copyright infringement and music licensing, drone testing, artificial intelligence and federal I.T. modernization.\n\nTo up its government game, Amazon has been hosting Washington decision makers at its Seattle headquarters, flooding a company Twitter feed with images of lawmakers at HQ1, including Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Democratic Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington state, and Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) in recent months. State and local lawmakers stop in at Amazon offices and fulfillment centers in Michigan, Indiana, Virginia, Arizona and Georgia, to name a few.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis got his Bezos-led tour in August 2017, as Amazon was being drawn into a war with other tech giants over the $10 billion contract to move Pentagon data to the cloud. In July, the department had solicited proposals on a winner-take-all contract that seemed designed to favor Amazon. Oracle filed a protest on Aug. 6. A few days latter, Mattis was schmoozing in Seattle.\n\n\u201cA pleasure to host Secretary of Defense James Mattis at Amazon HQ in Seattle today,\u201d Bezos wrote on Instagram.\n\nIBM followed suit with a bid protest in August, writing that the contract\u2019s \u201crigid\u201d requirements \u201cserve only one purpose: to arbitrarily narrow the field of bidders.\u201d The companies have launched lobbying and media campaigns that got the attention of lawmakers.\n\nOn Oct. 22, House Appropriations Committee members Steve Womack (R-Ark.) and Tom Cole (R-Okla.) asked for an investigation."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "kcheney@politico.com (Kyle Cheney)", "title": "Pelosi cranks up campaign to win over freshmen", "description": "The California Democrat is using every trick in her book to take back the speakership.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/13/nancy-pelosi-freshman-democrats-987699", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/79/73/7870e84e4991b70fdb41df0439f2/181113-nancy-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:20:45Z", "content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi secretly showed up to the Congressional Progressive Caucuss freshman orientation session on Monday to try to ingratiate herself with about 20 members-elect in attendance. | Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo Nancy Pelosis wooing of t\u2026 [+9095 chars]", "fulltext": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi secretly showed up to the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u2019s freshman orientation session on Monday to try to ingratiate herself with about 20 members-elect in attendance. | Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo Congress Pelosi cranks up campaign to win over freshmen The California Democrat is using every trick in her book to take back the speakership.\n\nNancy Pelosi\u2019s wooing of the incoming Democratic freshmen is in full force, with private meetings, deployment of Democratic bigwigs and lavish dinners with members-elect and their spouses.\n\nSeeking to return to the speaker\u2019s chair now that Democrats have won back the majority, Pelosi has launched a charm offensive for the incoming class of lawmakers in a bid to win its support, even though a number of them promised to vote against her when they were on the campaign trail.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPelosi secretly showed up at the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u2019 freshman orientation session on Monday to try to ingratiate herself with about 20 members-elect in attendance. There, Pelosi played up her role creating the caucus as an original founding member of the group and touted her background working as a progressive community organizer in California.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Pelosi held a reception for all Democrats at Osteria Morini, an Italian restaurant by the D.C. waterfront. On Wednesday, the members-elect will be introduced to their colleagues at a Democratic Caucus meeting, a lengthy process that will put them onstage with Pelosi. The California Democrat will follow that up with an appearance at the Congressional Black Caucus, a powerful faction inside the Democratic Caucus. Then, Pelosi will host a private dinner for members-elect and their spouses Wednesday evening in Statuary Hall, right off the House floor.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania have weighed in, as have former Vice President Al Gore and former Secretary of State and longtime Democratic Sen. John Kerry, according to Democratic aides.\n\nAnd Pelosi has been meeting in private \u2014 and calling \u2014 these lawmakers-to-be, although her aides won\u2019t provide a list of who she\u2019s sat down with this week.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the \u201cPelosi for Speaker\u201d blitz, with the California Democrat showing off every trick in her vast arsenal of persuasive tactics as she works to round up the votes she needs to win two upcoming votes: one inside the Democratic Caucus on Nov. 28, and the critical one on the House floor Jan. 3. While Pelosi will easily get a majority inside the Democratic Caucus, how she handles that vote is crucial. Letting some members and members-elect vote against her so they can say they opposed her, for example, would then free them up to back her on the floor. That will set the stage for the run-up to the Jan. 3 vote, where the stakes will be far higher.\n\nRep.-elect Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) \u2014 who was at the Progressive Caucus session on Tuesday \u2014 is supporting Pelosi's speakership bid. Escobar said their relationship began this summer, when Pelosi visited El Paso and attended a fundraiser for her campaign. Escobar will be meeting one-on-one with Pelosi later in the week.\n\n\"She and I have spoken a lot about border issues, immigration issues, El Paso issues, trade,\" Escobar said.\n\nFor Pelosi, the incoming freshman class \u2014 at least 33 strong right now, but still growing \u2014 is immensely important. Without the backing of an overwhelming majority of this class, she can\u2019t be speaker.\n\nYet a number of Democratic candidates expressed reservations about Pelosi and the entire House Democratic leadership during the campaign. And they\u2019ve repeatedly been pressed this week whether they would vote against her on the floor in the speaker roll call on Jan. 3, either by reporters, their future colleagues or party leaders.\n\nAlready four members-elect have declared publicly that they would oppose her both inside the Democratic Caucus on Nov. 28 and on the floor: Abigail Spanberger (Va.), Jason Crow (Colo.), Joe Cunningham (S.C.) and Max Rose (N.Y.).\n\n\u201cI am not voting for her \u2014 no if, ands or buts, under any circumstances,\u201d Rose said during an appearance on Fox News.\n\nThat comes on top of eight Democratic incumbents who've already declared their opposition to Pelosi, even on the House floor, meaning a dozen no votes are out there already. With a Democratic margin in the next Congress of anywhere from 15 to 20 seats expected next year, Pelosi can\u2019t afford to lose many more.\n\nPelosi has dispatched Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a colonel in the Air Force Reserve, to try to win over veterans who are currently against Pelosi or likely to vote against her, according to multiple Democratic sources. Lieu has been trying to persuade incoming freshmen Crow, Rose, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Chissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania \u2014 all ex-military \u2014 to vote against Pelosi in caucus but for her on the House floor, according to sources familiar with those conversations.\n\nLieu, who is close with VoteVets \u2014 an organization that financially supported these candidates \u2014 is not twisting arms. But Lieu is trying to convince these incoming freshmen that they have options other than going all-out against Pelosi.\n\nPelosi's efforts are paying off, although there remains a lot of work to be done.\n\nRep.-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said she's had two phone conversations with Pelosi, including a congratulatory call after she won her election, and she described those early interactions as \"really positive.\"\n\nBut Tlaib noted she hadn't made a final decision on whether she'll support Pelosi for speaker. \"She\u2019s willing to listen, and that\u2019s what I ask for right now at this point,\" Tlaib said.\n\nRep.-elect Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) said she met with Pelosi on Monday for an introductory discussion and intends to support her. \"It\u2019s hard to believe that the Affordable Care Act that has helped millions and millions of Americans would have passed without her,\" Haaland said. \"I thinks she\u2019s a strong leader, and that\u2019s what we need right now.\"\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/795/1155968404_5859496769001_5859491003001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nRep.-elect Angie Craig (D-Minn.), who knocked off GOP Rep. Jason Lewis, hasn't yet committed to supporting Pelosi but said she intends to support the Democratic Caucus' pick. That will be Pelosi.\n\n\"So far there\u2019s one person running and I\u2019m certainly voting for a Democrat, so there you go,\" Craig said, noting that she had been in contact with Pelosi during the campaign because she was one of the party's featured \"Red-to-Blue\" candidates.\n\nPelosi also showed her deftness in dealing with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the highly touted progressive star who knocked off Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) \u2014 once viewed as potential party leader \u2014 during her run for Congress.\n\nOcasio-Cortez turned up at a Tuesday morning protest by climate change activists right outside Pelosi\u2019s office, with a posse of reporters trailing her. Pelosi \u2014 who has recommended that the House bring back the select committee on climate change she first created eight years ago \u2014 had already talked with Ocasio-Cortez about the issue and moved fast to defuse Tuesday's protest.\n\n\u201cI have spoken with @NancyPelosi about how our commitments to climate change should take shape in the 116th Congress,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez informed her 1 million-plus followers on Twitter. \u201cHer office has responded quickly, and she has recommended the reinstatement of the Select Committee on Climate Change.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez described Pelosi as \"profoundly focused\" on a progressive agenda but said she's waiting to make a final decision on whether to support the California Democrat for speaker. Ocasio-Cortez noted top progressive leaders in the House plan to meet with Pelosi on Thursday to discuss next year's agenda. Ocasio-Cortez said she'd await the results of that meeting and is hoping for more details on the select committee, but also told reporters she's \"looking forward to us working together.\"\n\nWhile Pelosi's future is by far the biggest issue facing the party as they get ready for 2019, she's not the only one lobbying freshmen this week.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who has already locked down the votes to be majority leader next year, held a reception for group at the Library of Congress on Tuesday night, following by a \"candlelight tour\" of the Capitol. Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, and Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado \u2014 who are vying for majority whip \u2014 have also reached out to the new group of lawmakers.

With Mueller\u2019s probe on Russian inteference in the 2016 election winding down and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) loath to bring up a standalone Mueller-protection bill, Democrats argue it could be their last chance to shield the special counsel from Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMeanwhile, the president and his GOP allies are asking for a significant funding boost for border security in order for Trump to sign the government spending bill. Senate Republicans are advocating for $5 billion, while the outgoing House GOP majority has pushed for as much as $25 billion \u2014 figures that Democrats oppose absent a broader deal on immigration.\n\nIf the two sides can't come to terms, part of the government would shut down. Already, each party is heaping blame on the other, and the Senate is in session for only three weeks before the deadline.\n\n\u201cIs [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer going to shut down the government over border security?

Senate Democrats have signaled they could support $1.6 billion in border security money, though Trump and Republicans want more.\n\nCongress took some of the sting out of a potential shutdown earlier this year by agreeing to funding for three-quarters of the government through next fall. But Homeland Security and several other departments were left out, and their funding is set to expire in December.\n\nThe prospect of even a partial funding lapse gives each party significant leverage to fight for its policy goals on two of the most divisive issues facing Congress.\n\nWhen Congress set up the December showdown over some departments' funding, the idea was to postpone a fight over the border wall until after the midterms. But a new issue has emerged in the past week: Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced out and Democrats say they are not confident that acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker will protect Mueller from the president.\n\nSchumer said Tuesday that Democrats will \u201cattempt to add legislation to the must-pass spending bill in the lame duck session that will prevent acting Attorney General Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation.\u201d And other Democrats insisted that a bipartisan bill to protect the special counsel, which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in April, must be on the agenda in the lame duck.\n\n\u201cIt needs to happen now. Every day that goes by the special counsel is at risk,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cThe Republicans assured us that the special counsel would be fully protected. And now the only way that we can guarantee that is if we pass a bill by a huge majority in the House and the Senate.\u201d\n\nWarren and other Democrats said that the Mueller provision doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be in the spending bill. They just want a vote on the proposal during the lame-duck session.\n\n\u201cWhat would be acceptable to me is McConnell bringing our bill to the floor,\u201d said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \u201cThat would make me satisfied.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has said the bill is unnecessary, a view shared by most Republicans. Even Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who supports the measure, said that while he\u2019d vote for it on the floor, he would not insist it come up in the lame duck.\n\nWith McConnell unlikely to take action on the Mueller protection plan on its own, Schumer is suggesting that Democrats use their leverage over spending to ensure it passes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame them, politically they can make a lot of fuss over it. ... To be honest with you, there\u2019s not any reason to worry about it. Any president who would dump [Mueller] would be in real trouble,\u201d said outgoing Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).\n\nAs Democrats maneuver on Mueller, Republicans are eyeing a big border wall funding boost. Hatch said that means more than $5 billion that Senate GOP leaders had previously sought.\n\n\u201cI think everybody wants to do border wall funding in a bigger way,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader who is expected to be promoted to whip during Wednesday\u2019s leadership elections.\n\nHouse Democratic aides say the party will take a stand against a Trump-style, physical concrete wall. But they're open to a border security deal like the one agreed to early this year, which included new fencing that Republicans described as wall money. Plus, Democrats would rather clinch a spending deal now rather than haggle with it in January as they organize their new House majority.\n\nBut Democratic leaders say they aren't willing to go beyond the $1.6 billion that was agreed to earlier this year.\n\n\"We think that's more than adequate for reasonable investment in border security,\" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). \"At this point, [Trump] can't spend it. He can't spend it responsibly. We know it's a lead in to the 2020 cycle.\"\n\nHouse Republicans have already crushed multiple Democratic attempts to protect Mueller\u2019s investigation by adding language to spending bills taken up at the committee level. Since Trump took office, Democrats on the powerful House Appropriations Committee have twice tried to force language that would block the Department of Justice from any attempt to \u201cobstruct, hinder, frustrate, impede, or prevent\u201d Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nHouse Democrats don\u2019t believe House Republicans will go along with the bill to protect the special counsel. But with the House changing hands and unpredictable leadership elections underway, lawmakers are prepared for just about anything to happen ahead of Dec. 7.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the House is going to do,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 3 Democratic leader. \"You\u2019ve been around long enough to know the chaos.\u201d\n\nSarah Ferris contributed to this report."}]
