Bloomberg is a 1964 graduate of Johns Hopkins.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBloomberg\u2019s gift represents the largest-ever donation to a U.S. college or university, according to the university and Bloomberg Philanthropies in a joint press release announcing the gift. A list of the largest university donations since 1967 published by the Chronicle of Higher Education appears to support that claim.\n\n\u201cI want to be sure the school that gave me a chance will be able to permanently open that same door of opportunity for generations of talented students, regardless of their ability to pay,\u201d Bloomberg said in a New York Times op-ed published Sunday.\n\nBloomberg, a billionaire philanthropist who served as both a Republican and political independent while mayor of New York, is registered today as a Democrat. He\u2019s among a large crop of Democrats considering a presidential bid. He spent millions in the 2018 midterms helping House Democratic candidates in the party\u2019s successful push to reclaim the House.\n\nMorning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Amid that, there\u2019s growing concern that America\u2019s top universities are financially out of reach for students from lower- and middle-income families \u2014 the group Bloomberg says the gift is solely targeting.\n\n\u201cThe school will be able to offer more generous levels of financial aid, replacing loans for many students with scholarship grants,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cIt will ease the burden of debt for many graduates. And it will make the campus more socioeconomically diverse.\u201d\n\nIn making the gift, Bloomberg called for improving college advising so \u201cthat more students from more diverse backgrounds apply to select colleges.\u201d He said it was time to persuade more colleges to increase their financial aid and accept more low- and middle-income students. He also encouraged more graduates to direct their alumni giving to financial aid \u2014 even if it\u2019s just a small donation.\n\nBloomberg said he made his first gift of $5 to Johns Hopkins the year after his graduation, but has since donated $1.5 billion to support research, teaching and financial aid. The new gift is in addition to those funds.\n\nThe announcement builds on work Bloomberg Philanthropies has done with the American Talent Initiative, which has a goal of attracting, enrolling or graduating an additional 50,000 lower-income students at the 296 colleges and universities that consistently graduate at least 70 percent of their students in six years.\n\nJohns Hopkins, which has an undergraduate sticker price of about $50,000 annually, will be able to offer no-loan financial aid packages because of the gift, Bloomberg and the university said.\n\nWhile it previously had a lower endowment than many of its peer institutions, Johns Hopkins will rank among the top 10 universities in per-student financial aid support because of the gift, according to the press release."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "mdixon@politico.com (Matt Dixon)", "title": "Scott headed to Senate as Nelson concedes in Florida", "description": "Nelson's political career now comes to a likely end after four decades in various elected posts.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2018/11/18/florida-recount-scott-headed-to-senate-nelson-headed-home-703364", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/61/43/e93d734c486fb00aaf9770e20c20/webp.net-resizeimage%20(8).jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T19:50:48Z", "content": "Sen.

Bill Nelson's defeat represents the loss of the de facto head of the Florida Democratic Party. | AP Photo Elections Nelson concedes to put end to bitter Florida Senate race\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Gov. Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida after two rounds of recounts finalized his razor-thin victory over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, who called the governor to concede Sunday.\n\nNelson's political career now comes to a likely end after four decades in various elected posts.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nScott\u2019s lead after the Nov. 6 general election was just over 12,000 votes, a number that shrank to roughly 10,000 after a machine and hand recount. Always trailing by a thin margin, the Nelson campaign had filed a stream of lawsuits that it predicted would produce thousands of additional votes for the three-term senator.\n\nBut those efforts failed, and Nelson is now set to address the media at 3 p.m. He called Scott to officially concede shortly after 2 p.m.\n\nScott put more than $50 million of his own money into the race, giving his campaign a significant financial advantage over Nelson.\n\nRepublicans have been quick to point out that roughly $50 million from outside Democratic groups was poured into defeating Scott in the closely watched race. On the other side, outside Democratic groups spent about $20 million to try and save the party\u2019s lone hold on power in a third-biggest state in the nation.\n\nIn Nelson\u2019s video conceding the race, he took a more contentious tone than is normally expected when a race comes to an end. He did not mention Scott\u2019s name once, noted he was \u201cheavily outspent,\u201d and listed several policy and political talking points that were used during the nasty race.\n\nThat included again calling elected office a \u201cpublic trust,\u201d a term he used throughout the campaign to imply Scott used his post as governor\u2019s office for self-gain.\n\n\u201cI was not victorious in this race, but I still wish to strongly re-affirm the cause for which we fought: A public office is a public trust,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nThe defeat represents the loss of the de facto head of the Florida Democratic Party, the title Nelson wore because he was the party\u2019s only statewide elected official. Newly-elected Democratic Agriculture commissioner Nikki Fried is the party\u2019s only statewide elected official.\n\nHer race also went through two rounds of recounts, but she ultimately beat Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell by more than 6,700 votes. Fried was losing slightly after election night, but unlike Nelson took the lead after ballots were recounted.\n\n\u201cTo everyone who put their lives on hold and worked to see the recount process through, to protect the integrity of our democracy \u2013 thank you,\u201d Fried tweeted shortly after the manual recount was completed at noon on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m honored to serve as your next Commissioner of Agriculture. Now, we come together and work in union to govern for the people of Florida.\u201d\n\nThough Nelson\u2019s loss is a gut punch for Democrats, getting a foothold in the Florida Cabinet, which has been completely Republican held for eight years, offers something of a silver lining. The Cabinet includes the governor, the agriculture commissioner, CFO and attorney general.\n\nIn another significant state-level race that went to a manual recount, outgoing state House Democratic Leader Janet Cruz knocked off Republican state Sen. Dana Young by just 411 votes, or .2 percent. The race was the most expensive 2018 state Senate race.\n\nTwo Florida House races also went to recounts. In Daytona Beach\u2019s House District 26, Republican Elizabeth Fetterhoff beat Democratic state Rep. Patrick Henry 50.05-49.95; and in Palm Beach County\u2019s House District 89, Republican Mike Caruso beat Democrat Jim Bonfiglio."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "qforgey@politico.com (Quint Forgey)", "title": "Trump blasts 'little Adam Schitt' on Twitter", "description": "&quot;Wow, Mr. President, that\u2019s a good one,&quot; Rep.

And when it is, it\u2019s a very small problem. So I know everybody\u2019s looking at that to that end. And it\u2019s going to work out, it\u2019s going to work out well.\u201d\n\nBut President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 of Finland told Ilta-Sanomat, the country\u2019s second-largest newspaper, on Sunday that he never discussed raking with Trump during their brief meeting in Paris last weekend, where the leaders attended various commemorations marking the centennial of the armistice that ended World War I.\n\n\u201cI mentioned [to] him that Finland is a land covered by forests and we also have a good monitoring system and network,\u201d Niinist\u00f6 said, adding that he recalled telling Trump: \u201cWe take care of our forests.\u201d\n\nThe Camp Fire in Northern California, the deadliest and most devastating wildfire in the state\u2019s history, has resulted in at least 76 deaths and nearly 1,300 people missing. The fire, which is 55 percent contained, has destroyed nearly 10,000 homes and set ablaze 233 square miles, according to The Associated Press.\n\nWhile in California, the president was reluctant to blame the effects of rising global temperatures for a series of increasingly devastating wildfires. Asked by reporters whether his visit to the fire zone had altered his opinions on climate change, Trump replied: \u201cNo. No. I have a strong opinion: I want great climate. We\u2019re going to have that, and we\u2019re going to have forests that are very safe.\u201d\n\nThe president has instead largely attributed the natural disasters to forestland mismanagement by California\u2019s leaders. He was widely criticized by local officials last week for a tweet in which he threatened to withhold the state\u2019s federal funding.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\u201d Trump wrote online. \u201cBillions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the president continued to emphasize the importance of working with environmental groups to improve forest maintenance, and pledged to \u201ctake care of the floors, you know, the floors of the forest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everybody\u2019s seen the light, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have this again to this extent.

I think that the future of the party is with people with an optimistic vision moving ahead. I don\u2019t think that will be me. I think there are better candidates out there.

The full list\n\n-- REP.-ELECT JOE NEGUSE (D-COLO.) tells CBS\u2019 MARGARET BRENNAN on \u201cFACE THE NATION\u201d that he will support NANCY PELOSI: \u201cLook I -- it\u2019s fascinating to me that it\u2019s the question that we got most often, at least the Democrats did, here during orientation, which is particularly interesting since there\u2019s no other candidate that I'm aware of that\u2019s running against Leader Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI intend to support her. You know I think that it\u2019s important that we have steady leadership right now. And I found it pretty heartening over the course of the last week some of the developments around it becoming clear that this leadership team is going to work to try to make sure that everyone has a seat at the table. You saw a message from Leader Pelosi\u2019s office by way of example around making sure that there is progressive representation on key committees in the Congress and the Congressional Progressive Caucus leaders endorsing her shortly thereafter so. So yeah, that\u2019s where I am.\u201d\n\nREP.-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN (D-PA.) also told Brennan she'd support Pelosi: \"Right now she's the only person who's running so it would appear as though that's where my vote would go. And right now I believe that she's an effective person in that job. ... I believe right now it looks as though it's heading in the direction that she will be our speaker. I think she's a pretty powerful person and capable person.\"\n\n-- PELOSI has to be feeling good. People keep coming out in support of her, while the \"rebel\" letter is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Little yellow butterflies flitted across the surface of the crop that filled the once-vacant warehouse with the comforting smell of damp grass clippings.\n\nIt was the middle of October, and aromatic plants represented the first harvest for Vertical, a California company that has already become a serious contender in the rapidly expanding legal cannabis industry. Comer, who just won reelection to Congress with 69 percent of the vote, has promoted hemp, the non-psychoactive sister plant to marijuana, as a jobs-creating crop to replace the state\u2019s vanished tobacco industry. Hemp grown for CBD, a medicinal oil used for complaints from arthritis to epilepsy, fetches as much as $8,000 per acre, compared with less than $600 for the same amount of corn. This processing facility, Comer said, will create 125 jobs when Vertical has it fully operational, a not insignificant boost in a town of 2,600 people.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nVertical\u2019s future, as well as the state\u2019s infant hemp industry as a whole, rests in large part with the passage of the vast farm bill that Congress is expected to finish in the lame-duck session. Thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the bill includes an amendment that would permanently remove hemp from the list of federally banned drugs like heroin and cocaine, freeing hemp from the crippling legal stigma that has made it economically unviable for the past four decades. But that amendment also includes a little-noticed ban on people convicted of drug felonies from participating in the soon-to-be-federally-legal hemp industry.\n\nAdded late in the process, apparently to placate a stakeholder close to McConnell, the exception has angered a broad and bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, hemp industry insiders and religious groups who see it as a continuing punishment of minorities who were targeted disproportionately during the war on drugs and now are being denied the chance to profit economically from a product that promises to make millions of dollars for mostly white investors on Wall Street.\n\nLegalization has made steady progress at the state level since California first approved medical marijuana in 1996. As of election night, 33 states now allow medical marijuana, and 10 states plus the District of Columbia allow fully recreational use. But at the federal level, a sizable headwind remains. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions had vowed to enforce all federal drug laws; the position of his acting replacement, Matthew Whitaker, remains a mystery. And lawmakers like McConnell, who have discovered the economic benefits of relaxing prohibitions on products such as hemp, have nevertheless quietly found ways, like the farm bill felon ban, to satisfy the demands of their anti-legalization constituents, to the chagrin of pro-cannabis lawmakers and activists. After POLITICO Magazine reported on the drug-crime felon ban in August, three senators\u2014Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.)\u2014wrote to Senate leadership demanding the removal of the ban, citing its \u201cdisparate impact on minorities,\u201d among other concerns.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a growing recognition of the hypocrisy and unfairness of our nation\u2019s drug laws, when hundreds of thousands of Americans are behind bars for something that is now legal in nine states and something that two of the last three Presidents have admitted to doing,\u201d Booker told POLITICO Magazine. \u201cIf we truly want to be a just and fair nation, marijuana legalization must be accompanied by record expungement and a focus on restorative justice.\u201d\n\nThe fairness problems inherent in the felon ban are evident even in a predominantly white community like Cadiz. Vertical\u2019s CEO is himself a felon. Todd Kaplan pleaded guilty in 2010 to tax evasion, but because his crime was not drug-related, he won\u2019t be barred from participating in the hemp business. But for many men in rural Kentucky, where illegal marijuana was a staple crop, the lifetime ban included in the proposed farm bill means they\u2019re shut out of a growing industry in which they have have actual job skills.\n\n\u201cIf you exclude him, you put him in that category where he might want to rob a bank or a Walmart. If you ban him from the one thing he knows, what's left for him to do now?\u201d a Kentucky felon and licensed hemp grower told POLITICO Magazine on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe thing is, when Mitch McConnell put that felon ban in, he didn\u2019t follow Kentucky law that caps our ban at 10 years. It should be why a felon should grow this crop, not why he shouldn\u2019t. \u2026 If I was busted for moonshining, would it be illegal under the farm bill for me to grow corn?\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Comer about the felon ban at the ribbon-cutting for Vertical's hemp-processing plant in Cadiz, he said it was not something he endorsed. \u201cI would not have added the language preventing anyone with a prior minor drug-felony conviction from being able to produce hemp. I support the basis for criminal justice reform as it pertains to the sheer quantity of senseless petty drug sentences.\u201d\n\nComer, who approves of the House's plan to force work requirements on recipients of the food stamps program known as SNAP, said he understands a primary reason able-bodied adults aren't participating in the workforce is because of their criminal records. \u201cI\u2019m sure the language was added to appease certain senators,\u201d Comer told me. \u201cBut it really goes against the direction our country is headed with respect to criminal justice reform related to minor drug offenses.\u201d\n\nBut when I asked whether he will vote for the farm bill in spite of the felon ban he professes to dislike, Comer didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nEven Kaplan, Vertical\u2019s chief executive, agrees the felon ban doesn\u2019t make sense. Ten years ago, Kaplan was a CEO of a health care company in the sleep apnea field. A federal prosecutor charged him with 137 counts of Medicare fraud, of which all but one count were later dropped. In 2010, Kaplan pleaded guilty to tax evasion and paid a $100 fine, according to court documents posted to his personal website. I asked him what he thought of the drug-crime felon ban in the farm bill.\n\n\u201cI live out here in California, and L.A. is doing something called a \u2018social equity program,\u2019 where if you were convicted of a drug crime, they\u2019re putting you at the top of the list for licensing\u2014and that\u2019s for THC,\u201d Kaplan told me by phone.\n\nThis once-radical notion that felons ought to gain priority for entry into a newly legal industry\u2014instead of being shut out\u2014has quietly gained bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, albeit not among Republican leadership.\n\nIn the House, this mounting opposition to the continuing punishment of felons first cropped up in September, when the Judiciary Committee passed its first pro-marijuana bill. It would expand access to scientific study of the cannabis plant, a notion agreed upon by marijuana\u2019s supporters and detractors alike. However, Democrats almost killed the bill because it included language that barred felons (and even people convicted of misdemeanors) from receiving licenses to produce the marijuana. Felon bans are commonplace in legal marijuana programs. Every state has some version of it, but most of them have a five- or 10-year limit. But the felon bans in both the Senate\u2019s farm bill and the House\u2019s marijuana research bill are lifetime bans, and the House bill includes misdemeanors, too.\n\n\u201cAny restriction on misdemeanors goes in the exact contrary direction of the Second Chance Act,\u201d said Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who will become chairman of the Judiciary Committee in January. His criticism was echoed by Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), who sought to have the misdemeanor language struck from the bill until its sponsor, Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), promised to address that language when it comes to the House floor.\n\nIn the Senate, the movement to protect the legal marijuana trade has taken the form of the proposed bipartisan Gardner-Warren STATES Act, which would maintain the status quo of federal non-interference in state-legal programs that was upended when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions repealed the Cole Memo, an Obama-era document that outlined a hands-off approach to state-legal programs. Booker\u2019s Marijuana Justice Act would adopt California-style principles and apply them federally, going far beyond the STATES Act, removing marijuana from Schedule I (defined as having no medical value and a high risk of abuse) and eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana. But unlike other pro-marijuana bills, it would also deny federal law-enforcement grants to states that don\u2019t legalize marijuana; direct federal courts to expunge marijuana convictions; and establish a grant-making fund through the Department of Housing and Urban Development for communities most affected by the war on drugs.\n\nBooker\u2019s bill has become popular among Senate Democrats. Ron Wyden, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Merkley and Elizabeth Warren have signed on as co-sponsors\u2014a list that looks a lot like a lineup of presumed candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\n\n\u201cFor too long, the federal government has propped up failed and outdated drug policies that destroy lives,\u201d Wyden told POLITICO Magazine. \u201cThe war on drugs is deeply rooted in racism. We desperately need to not only correct course, but to also ensure equal justice for those who have been disproportionately impacted. People across America understand and want change. Now, Congress must act.\u201d\n\nRecent polling shows that Americans agree with Wyden\u2014to a point. There is a widespread acceptance of legalizing marijuana. Gallup has been tracking this number since 1969, when only 12 percent of Americans believed in legalizing it; in October, Gallup put the number at 66 percent, the highest ever number recorded. Pew says it is 62 percent, also its highest number ever.\n\nBut there is far less acceptance of the idea that the war on drugs has had an adverse impact on poorer, minority communities, or that there should be some form of compensation in terms of prioritized access to the new industry. A poll conducted by Lake Research Partners, a progressive D.C.-based polling firm, earlier this year on the \u201cPolitics of Marijuana Legalization in 2018 Battleground Districts\u201d found that 62 percent of the 800 likely voters surveyed agreed with the idea \u201cwe need legalization to repair the financial and moral damage of the failed War on Drugs.\u201d However, when the pollsters added a racial component to this message\u2014whether the respondents felt that the marijuana prohibition \u201cunfairly target[s] and destroy[s] minority communities\u201d\u2014only 40 percent found that message to be \u201cvery convincing.\u201d\n\nWhile voters might doubt who has suffered because of laws against marijuana, there should be little doubt about who is benefiting from its legalization. In 2017, the North American marijuana industry was valued at $9.2 billion, and it is expected to reach $47.3 billion by 2027, according to Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics. The excitement around marijuana investment is so high that even John Boehner, who as speaker of the House blocked the District of Columbia from implementing its legal marijuana program, has recently joined the board of Acreage Holdings, one of the largest vertically integrated cannabis operators in America. Just before Election Day, he penned an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, which read in part: \u201cI am now one of those Americans [who favors legal marijuana] \u2026. Representatives must use what the people tell them to question constantly which policies are serving the greater good. It\u2019s past time for government to rethink how it approaches cannabis.\u201d\n\nWitnessing such epiphanies, it\u2019s little surprise then that many in the black community are suspicious of the motives of men like Boehner in the legalization lobby. Perhaps this is why many members of the Congressional Black Caucus have been slow to support marijuana legalization. But the CBC finally made its position on this issue clear in June when its 48-member caucus voted in an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d to support policies beyond mere decriminalization: \u201cSome of the same folks who told African-Americans \u2018three strikes and you\u2019re out\u2019 when it came to marijuana use and distribution, are now in support of decriminalizing the drug and making a profit off of it,\u201d CBC Chairman Cedric L. Richmond, a Democrat from Louisiana, said at the time. \u201cThe Congressional Black Caucus supports decriminalizing marijuana and investing in communities that were destroyed by the war on drugs.\u201d\n\nArguments for legalizing marijuana haven\u2019t been entirely persuasive to sway many in the conservative black community, but reframing it in the context of civil rights has brought many around to this new way of thinking.\n\n\u201cWhat is moving conservative black and brown folks is this idea that we\u2019re on the horizon of marijuana legalization,\u201d according to Queen Adesuyi of the Drug Policy Alliance. \u201cSo the idea is in order to do this in a way that is equitable and fair, you have to start on the front end of alleviating racially biased consequences of prohibition while we\u2019re legalizing\u2014and that means expungement, re-sentencing, community re-investment, and looking at where marijuana tax revenue can go, and getting rid of barriers to the industry.\u201d\n\nNow that Democrats have won control of the House, a co-founder of the Cannabis Caucus, Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), is poised to implement his blueprint for how the House under Democratic leadership would legalize marijuana at the federal level. Racial justice is front-and-center in that plan. The memo he sent to Democratic leadership reads in part, \u201ccommittees should start marking up bills in their jurisdiction that would responsibly narrow the marijuana policy gap\u2014the gap between federal and state marijuana laws\u2014before the end of the year. These policy issues \u2026 should include: Restorative justice measures that address the racial injustices that resulted from the unequal application of federal marijuana laws.\u201d\n\nJames Higdon is a freelance writer based in Louisville and author of The Cornbread Mafia: A Homegrown Syndicate\u2019s Code of Silence and the Biggest Marijuana Bust in American History.

Jim Jordan, on Friday began flirting openly with a bid to serve as the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, the panel where a flood of Democratic-led investigations, and potential impeachment, will begin.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"We\u2019re still looking at it,\" the Ohio Republican said when asked whether he would run for the post. \"I\u2019ve always been one who\u2019s going to fight to get the truth out no matter what role I have. So we\u2019ll just wait and see.\"\n\nRepublicans' pick will be critical for Trump and his party. The new House Democratic majority has detailed a long list of targets for investigation, from Trump\u2019s business entanglements to his decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey. Even after Republicans were routed in the midterms, GOP leaders are vowing to aggressively defend against Democratic probes, which they've labeled \"presidential harassment.\"\n\nThe top slot on the Judiciary Committee also comes with a powerful policy portfolio. The committee has jurisdiction over immigration, gun control and abortion, as well as oversight of the Justice Department and FBI. But with Capitol Hill polarized over the president, the next ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee will likely be spending more time fighting for Trump than legislating with Democrats. It\u2019s a reality that is already coloring the jockeying for the job.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

That led to whispers and speculation that Trump wanted Jordan in the Judiciary slot, though Trump has declined to explicitly endorse him.\n\n\"I would like to see Jim in a high position \u2019cause he deserves it,\" Trump told the Daily Caller on Wednesday. \"He\u2019s fantastic, but I haven\u2019t gotten into the endorsement or not.\"\n\nJordan's interest in the role has scrambled the calculus for the other GOP lawmakers eyeing the job, including Rep. Doug Collins, who's widely perceived as the front-runner.\n\nCollins has spent a year maneuvering meticulously to become the lead Republican on the committee. The affable Georgian has crisscrossed the country fundraising for colleagues, forged relationships with Republicans in House leadership and showcased his legislative chops by partnering with Democrats to advance high-profile legislation.\n\nBut since Election Day, when rumors of Jordan's interest in the position began to surface, Collins has taken pains to emphasize all the ways he\u2019s backed up Trump in investigations and on the House floor over the last two years.\n\nCollins' allies note that he has taken on the Justice Department over GOP allegations that senior officials were biased against Trump \u2014 an issue Jordan has championed for a year. And Collins himself says that even as he considers ways to collaborate with Democrats, he'll relish the chance to beat back any \"overreach\" in their investigations of the president.\n\n\"I can fight as hard as anyone on this stuff,\" he said in an interview.\n\nAnd as for Jordan's reputation as a pro-Trump street fighter, Collins said he's better equipped to be a strategic defender of the president. He's been on the Rules Committee, he noted, which gives him expertise on potential tactics to fight Democratic probes.\n\n\"You don\u2019t always have to be the loudest voice in the room,\" he said. \"You just have to be the smartest voice in the room.\"\n\nJordan would likely face an uphill climb to win the post \u2014 even if he got an explicit push from Trump. That's because the coveted slot is awarded by the leadership-dominated GOP Steering Committee, which will meet later this month to nominate committee leaders.\n\nThe committee's recommendations are also ratified by the full House GOP. Jordan, vice chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, has alienated elements of the Republican Conference with hard-line tactics over the years. His opposition to McCarthy's 2015 bid to become speaker helped doom the California Republican's chances.\n\nBut Jordan's looming presence appears to have shifted the Judiciary Committee race.\n\nCollins is working double-time to emphasize his track record of support for Trump's priorities. The day after Democrats won the majority, Collins' first statement was an attack on incoming Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.).\n\n\"Our counterparts across the aisle are giddy about running roughshod over process and weaponizing taxpayer resources against President Trump, the Commander in Chief Americans elected,\" he wrote. \"We're here to remind Mr. Nadler that a House majority doesn't give liberals license to chase political vendettas.\"\n\nThe tone was notable for Collins, who \u2014 despite often sparring with Democrats on the House floor \u2014 had spent much of the year highlighting his outreach across the aisle on a bill to modernize copyright laws for the music industry and, more recently, forge a hard-won deal on prison reform legislation. Trump himself embraced the bill last week and highlighted it at a White House press conference with Collins standing at his right shoulder.\n\nIt was the second time Collins was at the White House for a legislative event this year. He stood alongside the president for the signing of the bipartisan Music Modernization Act.\n\nDespite his harsh words for Nadler, Collins said he and the liberal New Yorker get along.\n\n\"We do have a good relationship in the sense that we can talk,\" he said. Collins added that he sees potential for bipartisan cooperation on issues like intellectual property, criminal justice reform and privacy rights.\n\nThough Collins appears to have an inside track for the post, he also must overcome a bid by a more senior GOP lawmaker, Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, who has been touting his more than two decades of time on the committee in a pitch to colleagues.\n\nChabot is one of two remaining House members who helped manage the GOP impeachment of President Bill Clinton, experience he said would be invaluable if Democrats try to impeach Trump in the next Congress.\n\nIn a phone interview, Chabot noted that he's the dean of the Ohio delegation \u2014 the one from which Jordan also hails \u2014 and has worked to support Republicans in the pivotal swing state. He's also got a long track record of legislating, noting that he helped pass abortion restrictions and victims rights legislation and oversaw hearings on reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. And he noted that he has known Nadler, and served on the committee with him, for decades.\n\nDespite Collins' relationships, Chabot said he's been talking with members of the GOP Steering Committee \"off and on for three or four months\" and says his chances to win the post are \"excellent.\"\n\nChabot, too, noted Jordan's potential entry into the contest. He said he likes Jordan and that they generally vote the same way on legislation. \"Didn't Nancy Pelosi say, 'Come on in, the water's warm?'\" Chabot joked, referencing the Democratic leader's comments welcoming a potential challenge to her position.\n\n\"If we have a dozen people who jump in,\" he said, \"I would stack my credentials and my bona fides against anybody else.\"\n\nDemocrats are warily eyeing the emerging contest to determine who Nadler may be squaring off against next year.\n\nNadler has often noted that the committee attracts some of the most ideological members of Congress because its roster of divisive issues repels moderates and lawmakers in swing districts.\n\n\"While the Judiciary Committee is usually where you find the most partisan debate, some members engage in it more than others,\" said a Democratic committee staffer. \"Hopefully there can be cooperation and opportunities to work together in the new Congress with whomever the Republicans elect.\"\n\nNadler, though, has foreshadowed an aggressive stance that's sure to mean confrontation with Trump and his supporters.\n\n\"@RealDonaldTrump may not like it,\" he tweeted just hours after Democrats secured the House majority, \"but he and his administration will be held accountable to our laws and to the American people.\""}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "kodonnell@politico.com (Katy O'Donnell)", "title": "How Democrats plan to save the agency Republicans love to hate", "description": "Maligned consumer protection bureau gets new allies in Democratic House", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/18/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-democrats-999626", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/56/cb/4f202bea4f08840ca9f866af6ce0/181116-elizabeth-warren-gtty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T11:50:46Z", "content": "Party lawmakers have seethed for the last year at the cutback on enforcement and curtailed funding requests at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the brainchild of Sen.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMulvaney, Trump's budget director, will soon depart as acting CFPB chief to be replaced by his little-known lieutenant at the Office of Management and Budget, Kathy Kraninger, who has no experience in consumer affairs or banking. That could give the Democrats a much stronger hand in defending the Obama-era bureau, by doing everything from securing its independent source of funding to conducting endless oversight hearings.\n\nFending off further GOP attempts to rein in the CFPB \"would be a battle with this administration, and it would be a test of wills,\" said Rep. Lacy Clay of Missouri, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services subcommittee with jurisdiction over the agency.\n\n\"I'm ready to fight that battle,\" Clay said.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMaxine Waters, the California Democrat who will take over as chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, has made clear that shielding the agency will be a key priority. And even if Kraninger is confirmed as CFPB director by the time the gavel switches hands, there will be pressure from consumer advocates to investigate lingering questions from Mulvaney's tenure on how the agency has handled everything from fair lending enforcement to student loans.\n\n\"You can't protect consumers without looking at and investigating the CFPB under Mick Mulvaney,\" said Karl Frisch, executive director of the consumer group Allied Progress.\n\n\"We certainly need to know what motivated decisions that are now in place \u2014 it doesn't matter who's in charge at that point,\" he added.\n\nWaters also introduced a bill last month to \"reverse the harmful changes the Trump administration has imposed.\"\n\nHer bill would limit the number of political appointees at the bureau \u2014 a category Mulvaney dramatically expanded \u2014 and restore the organizational structure of the student loan and fair lending offices, which he folded into larger divisions.\n\nIt would also require that the agency's consumer complaint database remain publicly accessible and restore the panel of Consumer Advisory Board members that Mulvaney dismissed suddenly in June.\n\nThe legislation won't get traction with a Republican Senate, but it provides a road map for Waters' oversight agenda.\n\nUnlike that of most agencies, the CFPB's financing isn\u2019t determined by the congressional appropriations process \u2014 it comes through the Federal Reserve system by a fixed formula instead \u2014 so lawmakers can't throw around funding threats to get their way. There's no legal mechanism for lawmakers to reopen unsatisfactory agency settlements. And as long as Congress is divided, Democrats' CFPB legislation won't go anywhere.\n\n\u201cThey can make life for Mulvaney or Kathy Kraninger less pleasant, but they're not ultimately going to be able to have much of an impact on policy \u2014 they don't have powers that will allow them to do that,\" said Ori Lev, former deputy enforcement director for litigation at the bureau.\n\nStill, the electoral victory by House Democrats itself is a major step to protecting the agency: They\u2019ve denied the GOP a united Congress to pass legislation limiting the bureau's power.\n\nRepublicans have proposed replacing the CFPB director with a bipartisan commission and funding the agency through appropriations \u2014 moves that CFPB defenders say would cripple the bureau and expose it to political pressure.\n\nThere are rare points of potential bipartisan agreement on CFPB oversight \u2014 both parties have called for more transparency on its rulemaking process, for instance, and neither is thrilled with Mulvaney's decision to eliminate routine supervisory exams on lending to members of the military.\n\nFor the most part, though, the Financial Services hearing room will be the setting for a Democratic revenge play.\n\nAt the top of the list for Democrats is the way the bureau has handled its fair lending obligations. The issue burst into the spotlight in late September with the revelation that a top Mulvaney appointee in charge of fair lending, Eric Blankenstein, had anonymously written racially offensive blog posts in 2004.\n\nIf Blankenstein is still in his position come January \u2014 Mulvaney has referred the matter to an inspector general \u2014 he can count on being hauled up to the Hill to explain himself. But it's not just 14-year-old blog posts generating concerns about the bureau's commitment to thwarting discrimination.\n\nOne of Mulvaney's first moves upon taking over in late November 2017 was to move the agency's fair lending office into the supervision and enforcement unit, effectively sidelining the office's Obama-era chief, Patrice Ficklin. No fair lending cases have been announced since then.\n\nMeanwhile, the CFPB rulemaking agenda released in October lists \"re-examining\" its duties under a law policing credit discrimination. And the bureau is expected to release a proposal in March scaling back requirements for its 2015 update to a mortgage disclosure law that helps track discrimination.\n\nDemocrats are also eager to dig into the agency's handling of student loans \u2014 another office Mulvaney downgraded.\n\nWaters penned a letter in October urging Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) to use \"the full range of the Committee's oversight authorities\" to investigate charges by a departed CFPB official that political appointees had repeatedly undermined career staff efforts to police student loan servicers. That included quashing a report on banks allegedly charging students dubious fees.\n\nWaters' bill would require the CFPB to hand over all documents related to the report's suppression.\n\nFinally, the scheduled January release of the agency's planned revision to its payday-lending rule will offer an early opportunity to question Mulvaney on how meetings with industry donors may have influenced his thinking.\n\nThere will be plenty of demands on the agency to \"'show your work,'\" said a former CFPB official who dealt with Republican congressional requests in the past. \"'Let's see your scratch paper.'\"\n\nZachary Warmbrodt contributed to this report.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "srodriguez@politico.com (Sabrina Rodriguez)", "title": "Trump's Mexico-Canada deal hits trouble in Congress", "description": "Liberals and conservatives alike are raising objections that could imperil the president's signature trade agreement.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/18/trump-canada-mexico-trade-deal-congress-1000532", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/20/53/5e2d3b0342cf9830df6d1a27b6e4/181117-trump-gty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T11:43:59Z", "content": "If his trade deal is blocked in Congress, President Donald Trump will be facing a major setback on an issue where hes already been claiming credit for delivering on a campaign promise. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Donald Trump may be touting his \u2026 [+4821 chars]", "fulltext": "If his trade deal is blocked in Congress, President Donald Trump will be facing a major setback on an issue where he\u2019s already been claiming credit for delivering on a campaign promise. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Trade Trump's Mexico-Canada deal hits trouble in Congress Liberals and conservatives alike are raising objections that could imperil the president's signature trade agreement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump may be touting his trade deal with Canada and Mexico as a victory, but emerging complaints from liberals and conservatives are threatening to sink the agreement in Congress.\n\nDemocrats, whose votes Trump needs to pass the deal in the House, say they want to see stronger protections against pollution and climate change, improved labor standards in Mexico and certainty that the U.S. will regain jobs lost to Mexico.

He would be left with the unattractive choices of leaving the North American Free Trade Agreement in place, heading back to the negotiating table, or pulling out of the deal entirely, as he\u2019s repeatedly threatened.\n\nAnd it\u2019s unclear whether the White House can make fixes that will placate enough lawmakers to win approval. The Trump administration plans to sign the pact at the end of November, leaving the president with less than two weeks to persuade Mexico and Canada to agree to any tweaks. After that, Trump could pursue changes through side deals or the legislation to implement the agreement. But both those options would be more difficult and could be a tough sell for Canada and Mexico.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The latest midterm results show the GOP with only 198 House members next year, with six races still undecided. And now even some Republicans are threatening to defect. Forty lawmakers sent a letter to Trump on Friday protesting new protections for LGBT workers, which were included at Canada\u2019s request.\n\nAnd those GOP defections would come on top of Democrats threatening to withhold their votes unless there are changes to labor and environmental provisions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be Democratic votes if those steps aren\u2019t taken,\u201d Rep. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.) told POLITICO. \u201cEveryone needs to face up to that.\u201d\n\nIf the agreement remains on track, it will go to Congress for a simple up or down vote, with no amendments allowed under the fast-track law governing trade deals.\n\nBut House Democrats could jettison the fast-track rules to force the Trump administration to make changes. In 2008, House Democrats led by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi voted to suspend the fast-track timeline on the U.S. trade deal with Colombia over lingering concerns about labor standards and violence in the South American country.\n\n\u201cI warned the administration that they could find themselves in this trap of having some agreement and coming back to Congress as an afterthought expecting ratification,\u201d Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.) told POLITICO. \u201cThat\u2019s not how this place works.\u201d\n\nAnd Democrats aren\u2019t ruling out the idea of reopening the negotiations with Mexico if necessary.\n\n\u201cEverything is going to be on the table if it means trying to find 218 votes. That\u2019s just the nature of this,\u201d Kind said. \u201cIf there has to be some reopening, some renegotiation in order to get there, then so be it. But it\u2019s better than having it fail\u201d in votes.\n\nMeanwhile, Mexico and Canada have already said they don\u2019t see a need to reopen the negotiations. Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo told reporters last week that he didn\u2019t see \u201cany necessity, not even through side letters,\u201d to tweak the deal.\n\n\u201cThe design of this agreement we already have and will be signing considered a scenario where there\u2019d be a Democrat-led House,\u201d Guajardo said.\n\nMexican officials have also signaled that Mexico\u2019s Congress will pass legislation before the end of the year that addresses many of the labor groups\u2019 concerns surrounding rights to collective bargaining and secret votes for members of labor unions.\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), who is expected to chair the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, struck a more optimistic tone. He noted that the Trump administration knows what needs to be changed on labor standards and enforceability.\n\nSome Democrats are also waiting to see a U.S. International Trade Commission analysis on the effect of the new agreement on the U.S. economy and individual industries, Pascrell said. That investigation, required by law, will wrap up with a report due by mid-March. It will outline how the deal affects employment and wages \u2014 two of the chief labor concerns.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going in the right direction,\u201d Pascrell said. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to have a better document.

On the campaign trail, Ocasio-Cortez talked about forming a \"corporate-free caucus\" as a means to push for reform. That type of group, if it forms, could turn out to be the left's counterpart to the Freedom Caucus, which pushed Republican leadership to the right.\n\n\u201cI don't think people who are taking money from oil and gas companies should be drafting climate legislation,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on the call.\n\nAs for which Democrats they will target, the grass-roots organization welcomed its members to submit nominations of candidates and potential districts to target in 2020.

So get your squad together. We are waiting for you,\u201d Tlaib said in a statement.\n\nThe grass-roots group expects to focus more on safe Democratic seats \u2014 as Crowley\u2019s was \u2014 than on the swing districts, largely centered in the suburbs, that the party won en route to the House majority. That\u2019s a slight shift in strategy after all of the group\u2019s candidates, such as Kara Eastman in Nebraska, came up short in Republican-held congressional districts in 2018. Replacing safe Democratic incumbents with more progressives and diverse leaders, the thinking goes, could move the Overton window of what is and is not acceptable in the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of blue districts in this country where communities want to support a new generation of diverse working class leaders who fight tirelessly for their voters and build a movement around big solutions to our country\u2019s biggest problems,\u201d said Rojas.\n\nThere are parallels between this effort and the tea party movement during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, when congressmen in solid Republican seats, like former Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia faced primary challenges from the right.\n\nStill, it is unusual for freshmen Democrats to throw their support behind an organization that is threatening to wage primaries against their new colleagues. And it\u2019s unclear whether it could trigger a backlash from incumbent lawmakers who want to take advantage of their newfound majority to get things done, rather than sweating a primary challenge.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez has already made clear she\u2019s looking to break the mold. During her first week in Washington, she joined a protest in Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office, supporting calls for a \u201cGreen New Deal.\"\n\n\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a very polite move to do,\" Chakrabarti said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said at the sit-in that she was not there to protest Pelosi but to support the activists and their agenda.\n\n\u201cShould Leader Pelosi become the next speaker of the House, we need to tell her that we\u2019ve got her back in showing and pursuing the most progressive energy agenda that this country has ever seen,\u201d she told them. \u201cThis is about unity. This is about solidarity.\u201d"}]
