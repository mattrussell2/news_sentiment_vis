Nowadays, essential products and resources including water, electricity, transportation, gasoline, and toiletries are all in scarce supply, with regular blackouts across major towns and cities.\n\nSuch dire statistics add weight to the growing international concern at Venezuela\u2019s economic and humanitarian crisis, caused in large part by the failed socialist revolution enacted under its late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and continued today under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Many leading figures are calling for a humanitarian or military-based intervention to end the crisis, although all relevant powers have so far pulled back the idea.\n\nThe regime continues to deny the existence of a crisis.

Foods showing the largest decreases this year in addition to turkey were a gallon of milk, $2.92; a 3-pound bag of sweet potatoes, $3.39; a 1-pound bag of green peas, $1.47; and a dozen rolls, $2.25. Several items saw modest price increases this year including cranberries, pumpkin pie mix and stuffing. A 12-ounce bag of fresh cranberries was $2.65; a 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix was $3.33; a 14-ounce package of cubed bread stuffing was $2.87; two nine-inch pie shells came in at $2.47 and a 1-pound veggie tray was $.75. A group of miscellaneous items including coffee and ingredients necessary to prepare the meal (butter, evaporated milk, onions, eggs, sugar and flour) was also up slightly, to $3.01. There was no change in price for a half-pint of whipping cream at $2.08.\n\nThose figures are in nominal prices. Adjusted for inflation, the price of a Thanksgiving dinner is the lowest it has been in a decade, according to the Farm Bureau.\n\nAverage weekly earnings are up 3.4 percent compared with a year ago, making the cheaper Thanksgiving even more affordable."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Charlie Spiering, Charlie Spiering", "title": "Donald Trump: Keeping Alliance with Saudi Arabia Despite Khashoggi's Death is 'America First'", "description": "\"It's America first for me,\" Trump explained, vowing that he would not give up on hundreds of billions of dollars to Russia and China by confronting Saudi Arabia.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/20/donald-trump-keeping-alliance-saudi-arabia-despite-khashoggis-death-america-first/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/afp/19/d79276_le-pr-sident-des-etats-unis-donald-trump-et-le-prince-ritier-saoudien-mohammed-e1542750133732.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:44:10Z", "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s America first for me,\u201d Trump explained, vowing that he would not give up on hundreds of billions of dollars to Russia and China by confronting Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi was killed at a Saudi consulate.

The deaths occurred approximately 80 miles inland from the Texas-Mexico border. The deaths bring the total for this year to 45 for this single county, according to the Brooks County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Tuesday.\n\nBrooks County Sheriff\u2019s Office Deputy Brenda Ligas received a call from Border Patrol agents on November 9, requesting assistance in recovering the body of a deceased migrant. The agent met Border Patrol agents who guided her into an expansive ranch located east of the Border Patrol immigration checkpoint. The area is a known human smuggling corridor where \u201ccoyotes\u201d will guide the migrants on a hazardous march around the checkpoint.\n\nAfter traveling nearly 15 miles into the ranch, the deputy came upon the scene near a water well where the deceased migrant\u2019s body lay face down in the dirt. Two ranch hands checking on the water well made the initial discovery of the deceased man and contacted Border Patrol agents. They detected a foul odor as they approached the well before the found the blackened, decaying body of the man who human smugglers abandoned.\n\nOfficials did not find any identifying documents. Only $8 in Honduran cash remained as a clue for officials to begin their identification process. That task now falls on the Webb County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office who provides autopsy services for Brooks County and several others.\n\nThe body showed beginning signs of decay as animals and insects began to eat away the flesh. The migrant\u2019s hand appeared to be partially removed by animals. Officials found a \u201cyellow colored ring\u201d and some bones from his hand.\n\nA local funeral home provided transportation of the remains, which will eventually make their way to Webb County.\n\nFour days later, Deputy Bianca Mora responded to a call from Border Patrol agents about another deceased migrant. This migrant, a female, died on a ranch located west of Falfurrias, an area located near the end of the smuggling trail where migrants are frequently picked up after making the march around the checkpoint.\n\nAgents escorted the deputy two miles into the ranch where they came upon the deceased migrant laying on her back, covered by a blue jacket, a black trash bag, a black sweater, and a silver space blanket, the Brooks County Sheriff\u2019s Office death inquisition report stated.\n\nBorder Patrol agents apprehended a woman in the area claiming to be the sister of the deceased woman. She identified the migrant as 34-year-old Zulima Guillero-Gaytan, a Mexican national. Agents told Deputy Mora that the sister was with the woman when she became ill and could no longer keep up. The human smuggler made the woman take two pills, the sister claimed. She passed out shortly after taking the pills.\n\nJustice of the Peace Oralia Morales requested an inquest and a toxicology report because of the statements made by the sister.\n\nOfficials did not disclose if the human smuggler or any other witnesses were apprehended along with the sister.\n\nGuillero-Gayton will be turned over to the Webb County Medical Examiner who will determine the cause and manner of death.\n\nThe two deceased migrants raised the death toll for Brooks County to 45, according to Sheriff Benny Martinez. The county accounts for the deaths of more than 20 percent of the 211 migrants who died this year in Texas during or after illegally crossing the border from Mexico.\n\nNationally, at least 348 migrants died in connection to illegal border crossings according to the International Organization for Migrants\u2019 Missing Migrant Project.

The company has partnered with an innovation firm, which previously focused on automated vehicle assembly, to develop a machine to begin harvesting broccoli and iceberg lettuce within two years. All told, the company plans to double the number of automated harvesters, which cost about $750,000 each, in the fields each year \u2014 until nearly everything can be machine-picked. On a recent morning, a machine that employs water-knife technology severed romaine heads as it moved through row after row of a lettuce field that stretched as far as the eye could see. The lettuce traveled on a belt to the machine\u2019s platform, where 12 men and women inspected, trimmed and boxed it.\n\nWithout the machine, a crew of 24 people is used to manually chop the lettuce before handing it over to the vehicle-mounted crew who do the inspections, trimming and boxing.\n\nThe NYT article also mentions Bartley Walker, a company which has developed a robot that can crawl through crops to detect weeds for removal. Without the robot, farmers use migrant laborers \u2014 mostly illegals \u2014 to manually kill weeds with a blade-tipped hoe.

The country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d On the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nTrump also noted America\u2019s strategic and financial relationship with the Saudis and argued that punishing the monarchy with a heavy hand would simply drive it into the waiting arms of America\u2019s great geopolitical adversaries:\n\nAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2013 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nThe president acknowledged the Saudi government presented a case against Khashoggi but said his murder was still an \u201cunacceptable and horrible crime.\u201d\n\nHe portrayed the claims of innocence by King Salman bin Abdulaziz and the practical ruler of the country, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as somewhat dubious, but explained his administration has little choice but to accept them, given the impracticality of taking harsh punitive action beyond the Treasury Department sanctions announced last week:\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body. Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2013 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t! That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nTrump concluded by acknowledging many congressional representatives will disagree with his decision, but he said it was the only course consistent with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy of international relations:\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2013 and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2013 so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\n\nSome of the senators and representatives unlikely to be satisfied with President Trump\u2019s statement are prominent Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who described Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed as \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cunhinged\u201d just a few days ago and declared, \u201cI have no intention of ever working with him again.\u201d\n\nAnother is Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who pronounced on Sunday \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence of the crown prince\u2019s involvement in the Khashoggi murder and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we can sweep this under the rug.\u201d\n\nCongressional leaders skeptical of Riyadh\u2019s story about Khashoggi\u2019s death have suggested punitive measures ranging from sanctions against more high-level officials and royals to suspending arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the very courses of action President Trump rejected in his statement.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Tuesday that President Trump \u201cdictated the sentiment in the statement\u201d because he \u201cwanted to put a comment in a single place that White House aides could refer to when journalists asked about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the sentiment is one Mr. Trump has repeatedly uttered to aides: The United States has a long history of overlooking Saudi misdeeds out of foreign policy concerns, but he felt he was uniquely being picked on publicly.

Jordan illegally occupied and annexed the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem from 1948 until Israel captured the lands in a defensive war in 1967.\n\nThe 1967 Six Day War was launched after Arab countries used the territories to stage attacks against the Jewish state. In 1988, Jordan officially renounced its claims to the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and unilaterally recognized terrorist Yasser Arafat\u2019s Palestine Liberation Organization as \u201cthe sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\nAirbnb\u2019s statement goes beyond the \u201coccupied\u201d canard to suggest Jews displaced Palestinians to build settlements. \u201cUS law permits companies like Airbnb to engage in business in these territories,\u201d Airbnb explained. \u201cAt the same time, many in the global community have stated that companies should not do business here because they believe companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced.\u201d\n\nHere, Airbnb seems to channel the wildly exaggerated Palestinian \u201cNakba\u201d narrative, which falsely claims that hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were expelled from their homes when the Jewish state was founded.\n\nThe reality is quite different. After Israel was founded in 1948, a military coalition of Arab nations immediately formed to wage war on the new Jewish state. Some local Arabs, who did not yet go by the name of Palestinians, left the area in anticipation of the war, others directly responded to the dictates of Arab states to stay out of the way so that invading armies could conquer Israel, and still others fled once the war started so that they were not caught up in the fighting.\n\nArab states waged the war after refusing to accept UN Resolution 181, which called for the partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. The Jews immediately accepted the resolution, but the Arabs forthrightly rejected the plan, launching a war to destroy the Jewish state.\n\nIt should be noted that Israel\u2019s Declaration of Independence called on the local Arab population to remain in place:\n\nIn the midst of wanton aggression, we yet call upon the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve the ways of peace and play their part in the development of the State, on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its bodies and institutions.\n\nIt is true that some Jewish groups, including the Haganah, encouraged local Arabs to flee, however those few documented cases were the exception and not the rule.\n\nThe Economist, for example, reported that the Arab residents of Haifa left their homes in large part because of Arab army warnings:\n\nOf the 62,000 Arabs who formerly lived in Haifa not more than 5,000 or 6,000 remained. Various factors influenced their decision to seek safety in flight. There is but little doubt that the most potent of the factors were the announcements made over the air by the Higher Arab Executive, urging the Arabs to quit. \u2026 It was clearly intimated that those Arabs who remained in Haifa and accepted Jewish protection would be regarded as renegades.\n\n\u201cArab officers ordered the complete evacuation of specific villages in certain areas, lest their inhabitants \u2018treacherously\u2019 acquiesce in Israeli rule or hamper Arab military deployments,\u201d wrote historian Benny Morris.\n\nAirbnb, meanwhile, singles out Jews for living in the West Bank while seemingly ignoring that Israel offered much of the territory to the PA in numerous peace proposals. As this reporter noted yesterday, if the Palestinians wanted a state, they would not have to resort to peddling the BDS movement. Israel attempted to broker a Palestinian state in much of the West Bank with a shared capital in Jerusalem numerous times.\n\nThose offers were made at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007, and more offers were made in 2008 and reportedly in 2014. In each of these cases, the PA refused generous Israeli offers of statehood and bolted negotiations without counteroffers. Many times, the PA launched campaigns of terrorism following the Israeli offers. The PA has since refused to return to the bargaining table, and has already rejected the Trump administration\u2019s forthcoming Mideast peace plan before it is even made public.\n\nIsraeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin slammed Airbnb\u2019s move as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d as well as \u201cdisgraceful and miserable.\u201d Levin called for his office to \u201cformulate immediate measures to limit the company\u2019s activity throughout the country,\u201d and to develop a plan to further promote West Bank tourism.\n\nStrategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan said he will investigate whether the decision violates local U.S. laws against boycotting Israel. He also called on Airbnb to explain why it singled out the Jewish state: \u201cNational conflicts exist all over the world. The heads of Airbnb will have to explain why they chose to take a racist political stance against some of Israel\u2019s citizens.\u201d\n\nKnesset Member Michael Oren, a former Israeli Ambassador to Washington, stated, \u201cAirbnb blacklists Jewish apartments in Judea and Samaria \u2014 not Palestinian apartments, not apartments in Turkish occupied Cyprus, in Moroccan occupied Sahara, not in Tibet or the Crimea.\u201d\n\n\u201cAirbnb\u2019s policy is the very definition of anti-Semitism.

According to mother Laura Hughes, who suffered similar symptoms after spending time in her daughter\u2019s Guangzhou apartment, Werner was diagnosed with \u201cvision, balance and hearing problems along with an organic brain injury.\u201d\n\nHughes told NBC News that she and her daughter heard loud, strange noises in the apartment and repeatedly saw evidence in the house that someone had broken in. The strange sounds, which diplomats in Havana also identified after being diagnosed, are what led researchers to initially refer to the attacks as \u201csonic\u201d in nature, though various theories exist on what has happened to the victim.\n\n\u201cWe heard a very high-pitched sound in Catherine\u2019s bedroom. And we heard a very low, pulsing sound in the living room,\u201d Hughes told NBC. \u201cOur heads would pulse. You would feel like you would want to regurgitate. You could become instantly paralyzed, instantaneously fatigued.\u201d\n\nHughes noted that, in addition to the illness she and her daughter felt, Werner\u2019s two dogs also suffered. The dogs, adopted after Werner repeatedly found evidence of burglary, would sometimes appear to have locked themselves in rooms they were not in when the apartment was left empty and would vomit blood when exposed to the strange sounds.\n\n\u201cYou vomit. You get sick. You feel so sick,\u201d Hughes explained. \u201cYour head is splitting. You\u2019re dizzy. It\u2019s a horrible feeling. It\u2019s indescribable.\u201d\n\nHughes described Werner as a \u201cshell of what she was\u201d after prolonged exposure to whatever was hurting her. She added what has become a familiar complaint from those affected: the U.S. State Department appeared to do little to help, she said.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that our military, our diplomats around the world or here at home are safe \u2026 instead of being helped by the State Department, it\u2019s an atrocity how they\u2019re taking care of this,\u201d she protested.\n\nThe Chinese government has offered very little response to the attacks publicly. The State Department told NBC News that it \u201ccontinues to provide our employees with access to the best medical facilities and doctors in the United States.\u201d\n\nWerner\u2019s is the only \u201cconfirmed\u201d case in the country, though others have come forward complaining of having suffered a similar set of incidents. Mark Lenzi, a worker at the Guangzhou consulate, said in a July interview that he had heard similar loud noises and suffered dizziness, nausea, and other \u201cconcussion-like\u201d symptoms. The State Department reportedly evacuated nine individuals from China and provided medical care to another 250 who feared exposure to the same attacks.\n\nHughes, Werner, and the diplomats attacked in Cuba are all being treated by experts in Philadelphia, where the most advanced studies on the situation are being conducted.\n\nThe Philadelphia team published a study in February definitively concluding that the 26 individuals suffering adverse health effects, including brain injury, in Cuba could not have induced these injuries through stress or psychological factors in any way. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), stated that a \u201cnovel mechanism\u201d had caused the injuries, without being able to elaborate.\n\nThe Cuban communist regime maintains that the true nature of the illnesses is psychological and political. A \u201creport\u201d broadcast on Cuban state television last year concluded that the Americans injured had heard cricket and cicada noises and failed to identify them as insects, instead responding with paranoia. Cuba\u2019s Foreign Minister referred to the attacks as \u201cscience fiction.\u201d\n\nUnlike the U.S. State Department, the Canadian government did not forcibly evacuate any of its diplomats from Cuba and has not confronted the Cuban government about the situation. An estimated dozen Canadian diplomats and family members suffered nearly identical symptoms to those of the Americans. Speaking anonymously to the Globe and Mail, those affected said they were disappointed by their government\u2019s lack of action in their defense.\n\n\u201cWe all love our jobs. We want to represent our country, and we know there is hardship involved in doing that, we know there is a price to pay,\u201d one diplomat told the newspaper. \u201cBut we did not expect to be abandoned, or more precisely, sacrificed \u2013 that\u2019s how we\u2019re feeling now.\u201d\n\nAnother suggested that Canada would never defend them against Cuba because \u201cof Canada\u2019s bid for a U.N. Security Council seat.\u201d\n\nThe diplomats told the Globe and Mail that the only reason they figured out what was happening to them was a private conversation with one of the affected Americans, also unnamed, who warned, \u201cYou know we\u2019re being evacuated. This is not right and you should know this, because our governments are not telling us, you need to know.\u201d\n\nTwo of the Canadian diplomats said they further suspected when two of their children suffered \u201cviolent nosebleeds on the same night at roughly the same time.\u201d\n\nThe Canadians further complain that their government initially blocked them from traveling to Philadelphia to have the medical team there compare their symptoms to the Americans\u2019. After months of bureaucratic roadblocks, some eventually did make it to the United States, where doctors diagnosed them with the same malady as their American peers.\n\nThe Canadian injuries complicate the theory that the Americans were victims of a coordinated political attack. The Cuban government has long engaged in illegal and unethical activities against Americans, in some cases murdering American citizens, but Ottawa and Havana have a long and friendly history. Late mass murderer Fidel Castro served as an honorary pallbearer in the funeral of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, father of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and thousands of Canadians flock to Cuba\u2019s beaches a year. Publicly, neither the American nor Canadian government have offered an explanation that would also account for the injury in China.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "John Hayward", "title": "European Court Orders Turkey to Release Kurdish Party Leader Selahattin Demirtas", "description": "The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on Tuesday urged Turkey to release pro-Kurdish opposition party leader Selahattin Demirtas from detention.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/11/20/european-court-orders-turkey-release-kurdish-party-leader-selahattin-demirtas/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/afp/20/125267_selahattin-demirtas-one-two-co-leaders-leftist-pro-kurdish-peoples-democratic-e1542744081524.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:08:35Z", "content": "Police arrested and detained Demirtas for two years before his trial in September, at which the court sentenced him to four years in prison for allegedly supporting terrorism.

He unsuccessfully ran for president of Turkey from prison in June.\n\nThe France-based ECHR ruled on Tuesday that \u201cjudicial authorities had extended Mr Demirtas\u2019 detention on grounds that could not be regarded as \u2018sufficient\u2019 to justify its duration\u201d and urged Turkish authorities to \u201ctake all necessary measures to put an end to the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cases and charges I was being prosecuted for have completely collapsed. Our battle for law and justice will continue under all circumstances,\u201d Demirtas said upon learning of the European court ruling.\n\n\u201cAfter this decision, every second Mr. Demirtas remains jailed is a restriction on freedom,\u201d his lawyer added.\n\nBefore his imprisonment, Demirtas was the co-chairman and public spokesman for the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP) and a sitting member of parliament. He ran for president as the party\u2019s candidate for president this year from a maximum-security prison cell and came in third place.\n\nThe HDP is the first pro-Kurdish party to meet the threshold of votes necessary to hold seats in the Turkish parliament. Its growing popularity poses a significant threat to the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is not noted for his fondness for Turkey\u2019s Kurdish minority.\n\nDemirtas was arrested in November 2016 along with the co-chair of HDP, Figen Yusekdag, and several other members of parliament. The arrests were exercises of the emergency powers Erdogan claimed after the failed coup against him in July 2016.\n\nThe initial charge against Demirtas was that he failed to cooperate with counter-terrorism investigators but he was later accused of spreading terrorist propaganda and working on behalf of the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a violent separatist organization. Demirtas countered that he was being unfairly prosecuted for attempting to build friendly relations with PKK leadership in 2013, at a time when the Turkish government was engaged in a peace process with the Kurdish separatists. The Erdogan administration sees the HDP \u2013 and most other Kurdish organization in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq \u2013 as little more than a wing of the PKK.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights ruling accepted that police initially detained Demirtas on \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of a criminal offense, but the court said he was detained far too long before receiving a trial and was unfairly prevented from discharging his duties as a member of parliament, which essentially disenfranchised the people who voted for him.\n\n\u201cThe Court found that it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that the extensions of Mr. Demirtas\u2019 detention, especially during two crucial campaigns, namely the referendum and the presidential election, had pursued the predominant ulterior purpose of stifling pluralism and limiting freedom of political debate, which was at the very core of the concept of a democratic society,\u201d the ruling stated.\n\nThe ECHR elaborated that Demirtas did not appear to meet the conditions for extended pretrial detention, such as \u201ca risk of absconding, tampering with evidence, or putting pressure on witnesses,\u201d and noted Turkish prosecutors scarcely made an effort to demonstrate his imprisonment was necessary under those conditions. A perfunctory effort was made at portraying him as a flight risk, but the ECHR found that contention absurd given his status as a sitting member of the National Assembly for almost ten years at the time of his arrest.\n\nThe ECHR also rejected the contention of Turkish prosecutors that the sheer number of charges leveled against Demirtas, good for over 140 years of prison time if he is found guilty on all counts, justified keeping him in prison until a long series of trials could be arranged. The overall tone of the ruling is one of severe disapproval of throwing sitting opposition officeholders in jail without a proper trial, although the court rejected some of Demirtas\u2019 complaints, including his contention that he never should have been arrested at all.\n\n\u201cThe decisions delivered by the ECHR do not bind us,\u201d Erdogan said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere are many things we can do in response. We\u2019ll make our counter-move and finish it off,\u201d he added ominously.\n\nThe Associated Press noted Turkey is legally obliged to respect ECHR rulings because it signed the European convention on human rights. Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul indicated a desire to review the ruling but insisted Turkish courts would decide Demirtas\u2019 fate.\n\nThe EHCR also awarded Demirtas about $30,000 in damages and court costs, although chances of collecting the money appear slim at the moment."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Joshua Caplan", "title": "Report: Actress Mareli Miniutti Claims Michael Avenatti Dragged Her on Floor, Yelled \u2018Ungrateful F*cking B*tch\u2019", "description": "Actress Mareli Miniutti alleged Michael Avenatti dragged her through an apartment and referred to her as an \u201cungrateful fucking bitch.\"", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/11/20/report-actress-mareli-miniutti-claims-michael-avenatti-dragged-her-on-floor-yelled-ungrateful-fcking-btch/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/mareli-miniutti-michael-avenatti.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:54:30Z", "content": "The Blast reports Miniutti \u2014 a 20-year-old Estonian native who has made small appearances in Jessica Jones, Gotham, and Ocean\u2019s Eight \u2014 has been living with Avenatti since January, according to the declaration she made to apply for the restraining order.

Marcia Fudge (D-OH), is under fire for previously defending a judge now accused of brutally murdering his wife.\n\nThe vicious hit on Fudge comes after she had attacked Pelosi as an \u201celitist,\u201d signed a letter with more than a dozen other Democrats vowing to oppose Pelosi for Speaker on the floor of the House early next year, and floated potentially running for Speaker herself against Pelosi.\n\nSpecifically, what has emerged is a letter Fudge wrote in August 2015 defending former Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Judge Lance Mason during his sentencing over brutally beating his wife Aisha Fraser. Mason ended up spending nine months in prison for the 2014 assault on Fraser, and after his release from prison was hired by Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson\u2019s administration in a minority business development role. But the assault was brutal\u2013he punched his wife 20 times, and smashed her head into the dashboard of their car, while their kids were watching in the back seat:\n\nMason in August 2014 punched his then-wife 20 times and slammed her head against the dashboard of his car five times, breaking her orbital bone. The couple\u2019s children were in the back of the car when the attack occurred. Mason, who previously served in the state legislature, was a sitting Cuyahoga County judge when the attack happened.\n\nThis account from Cleveland.com gives more details on the timeline of events, including how Fraser\u2013then going by her married name Aisha Mason\u2013had called 911 and told dispatchers she was afraid her husband would hurt her daughters.\n\nIn the wake of his arrest, indictment, and conviction the still-politically connected, though disgraced, former Judge got Fudge\u2013who had just finished her term earlier that year as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus in the U.S. Congress\u2013to write a letter in favor of his case. In the \u201cletter of support\u201d for Mason dated on August 9, 2015, Fudge writes that her backing of him \u201ccomes as a result of more than 20 years of friendship.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost assuredly, I am deeply saddened and disappointed at where we find ourselves today,\u201d Fudge wrote to Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty. \u201cThe behavior Lance displayed on August 2, 2014, is out of character and totally contrary to everything I know about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI commend Lance for immediately recognizing that he needed help and entered counseling which continues as of this writing,\u201d Fudge continued in the letter. \u201cFurther, he is working diligently to find a way to face what he has done to his family and his reputation. Lance accepts full responsibility for his actions and has assured me that something like this will never happen again.\u201d\n\nFudge continues for another two paragraphs lavishing praise on Mason as a \u201cgood man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lance T. Mason I know is a kind, intelligent man and loyal friend,\u201d Fudge wrote. \u201cThe Lance T. Mason I know is an advocate for the people of his community. Whether as a County Prosecutor, State Senator or Common Pleas Judge. He is well respected and well liked.\u201d\n\n\u201cLance Mason is a good man who made a very bad mistake,\u201d Fudge added. \u201cI can only hope that you see in Lance what I and others see.\u201d\n\nExcept, the problem for Fudge now, is that it does appear to have happened again\u2013and this time it was much worse than the first time. Fraser was brutally stabbed to death and none other than Mason has been taken into custody by police. The Washington Post\u2019s Michael Brice-Saddler reports on Tuesday:\n\nA disgraced former judge who went to prison for beating his then-wife so severely in 2014 that she required facial reconstructive surgery was taken into custody after she was found slain Saturday morning, Ohio police said. The Shaker Heights Police Department said officers responded to a 911 call at a residence in the morning, prompting them to launch an investigation into Aisha Fraser\u2019s killing. Ex-Cuyahoga County judge Lance Mason, Fraser\u2019s former husband, was taken into custody, police said.\n\nFudge\u2019s decision to put her own reputation on the line for this guy in an official congressional letter in 2015, stating emphatically that he assured her this type of abusive behavior would never happen again, is coming back to bite her now that she is putting herself into the national political limelight in the fight for the Speakership of the House.\n\nWe have found a letter of support from @RepMarciaFudge during the 2015 sentencing of Judge Lance Mason after the severe beating of his wife Aisha Fraser. Mason is now the lead suspect in the weekend murder of Fraser. @cleveland19news pic.twitter.com/6Yzgw2gkkD \u2014 Dan DeRoos (@DanDeRoos19) November 19, 2018\n\nBut now that Mason has been arrested in connection with Fraser\u2019s murder, Fudge is distancing herself from the man she defended to prosecutors just a few years ago. In a new statement released after his arrest, Fudge claimed she does not know him anymore:\n\nMy heart breaks for Aisha Fraser. I pray for Aisha\u2019s family, especially her children, as they attempt to deal with this tragedy. My support of Lance in 2015 was based on the person I knew for almost 30 years \u2013 an accomplished lawyer, prosecutor, state legislator and a judge. That\u2019s the Lance Mason I supported. The person who committed these crimes is not the Lance Mason familiar to me. It was a horrific crime. I and everyone who knew Aisha are mourning her loss.\n\nIt is hard to understate how critical this whole development is in the national political picture when it comes to the momentum of anti-Pelosi rebels, of which Fudge was absolutely one and perhaps the leader, in the lead-up to the early January 2019 House floor vote for Speaker of the House. Pelosi has been fending off a battle from inside her own conference, the fight of her life, of 17 Democrats including Fudge signed a letter released on Monday detailing how they intend to vote against Pelosi on the floor and in conference when it comes to who they support for Speaker. There are several more expected to oppose her on the floor who did not sign the letter as well. The conference vote will not be a problem for Pelosi, as all she needs there is a majority of the majority\u2013which she already has\u2013to win the official nomination of the Democrat Party for Speaker of the House. It is on the House floor where Pelosi is running into issues.\n\nAccording to Politico, the Democrats will have anywhere from 233 to 235 seats in their new majority in the House depending on how the last couple races get called. Since a Speaker candidate needs to win a majority of members present and voting for a candidate\u2013the candidate need not be declared or nominated, and eligibility is not confined to current members of the House but is much broader than that\u2013that means Pelosi would need 218 votes assuming all voting members are present and vote for a candidate. Depending on those final House races, Pelosi could only afford to lose anywhere from 15 to 17 Democrat votes and still win the Speakership without GOP votes\u2013even though some Republicans, notably Rep. Tom Reed (R-NY), have suggested they would be open to helping her in exchange for rules changes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has trolled Pelosi\u2019s problems, saying on Twitter that he will get her whatever GOP votes she needs to win:\n\nI can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House. She deserves this victory, she has earned it \u2013 but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away. She will win! @TomReedCongress \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 17, 2018\n\nBut Pelosi has insisted she wants to win with only Democrats, because relying on Republicans would make her weaker among Democrats and strengthen Trump\u2019s and Senate Republicans\u2019 hands in negotiations on major issues between the chambers of Congress and branches of government.\n\nAnother problem the rebels against Pelosi have run into is not being able to field a candidate against her, and that is where Fudge came in. Fudge floated potentially running for Speaker herself against Pelosi in recent days, hitting the once-and-potentially-future Speaker Pelosi as an \u201celitist\u201d who is out of touch with ordinary Democrats because she is so \u201cwealthy.\u201d Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), another leader of the anti-Pelosi rebels, has pushed Fudge as the alternative, saying she was his mentor in Congress and he backs her for Speaker.\n\nBut now, with Mason being arrested on suspicion of the murder of Fraser after Fudge defended Mason so vociferously just a few years ago, Fudge\u2019s shot at the speakership just got a whole lot more complicated. And, if there is anything for the anti-Pelosi rebels to learn from their Tea Party anti-John Boehner rebels from the last generation in Congress, it is that to succeed they would need almost everything to go their way between now and the early January vote on the floor.

Rand Paul (R-KY) said at a conference in Washington, DC, last week that he is beginning to see a \u201cright-left\u201d coalition movement growing, attracting those who want to restrain or end wars the U.S. is waging without congressional authorization.\n\n\u201cThere is a right-left movement out there talking about a more realistic foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some people who are coming together who are saying, \u2018we\u2019ve had too much war for too long.'\u201d\n\nFor example, Paul noted efforts between conservative Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), himself and Sanders, and himself and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough discussion about this,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul was the keynote speaker at a day-long conference hosted on Thursday by The American Conservative that explored the need for a more restrained American foreign policy and how to achieve that. The conference featured lawmakers and foreign policy experts from the right and the left.\n\nPaul argued that the U.S. would have a more modest and restrained foreign policy simply by following the Constitution, which he said gave the responsibility of waging war to Congress versus the Executive Branch.\n\nHe cited founding father James Madison\u2019s words to fellow founding father Thomas Jefferson: \u201cExecutive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in the Legislature.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of it comes back to, how should we be doing it?\u201d Paul asked. \u201cIs this a unilateral decision we leave to the president? Or is this something our founding fathers and the Constitution intended we would discuss?\u201d\n\nPaul argued that Congress has in recent years abdicated the responsibility of waging war to the Executive Branch.\n\nCongress authorized military intervention in 2001 in Afghanistan and 2002 in Iraq. However, both the Obama administration and the Trump administrations have used those authorizations for use of military force (AUMFs) to authorize war today in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen under vastly different circumstances.\n\nPaul spoke at length about his opposition to U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen. In 2015, after Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen overran the capital of Sana\u2019a, the Obama administration began supporting a Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Houthis.\n\nThe U.S. provided refueling, intelligence, and logistical support to the coalition. That support continued under the Trump administration, which has come under increasing pressure to end the policy in the face of Yemeni civilian deaths.\n\n\u201cThere is this old-fashioned notion that we actually vote before we go to war,\u201d Paul said.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cMy main objection in this whole thing is the war in Yemen is a tragedy like most wars, but it\u2019s a particular tragedy because they\u2019re one of the poorest countries on the planet \u2026 I think it is something we should not be participating in.\u201d\n\nPaul said he and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) have tried to stop U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and noted that he has gained support from colleagues over the last two years.\n\n\u201cI think opinion is changing over whether or not we should be arming Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said. He noted public backlash against the regime for its alleged murder of dissident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t help that they chopped up a dissident,\u201d he said, referencing unconfirmed reports in Turkish media that Saudi officials dismembered Khashoggi. Other reports suggested the Saudis dissolved Khashoggi in acid. As the Saudis have not produced a body, no confirmation exists regarding the fate of Khashoggi\u2019s remains.\n\nHe said some Republican colleagues argued that supporting Saudi Arabia was important to check Iran, its regional rival. But Paul said, \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not sure who is more evil, Iran or Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ask me who is the worst at sort of spreading hatred, and sort of spreading and trying to engender terrorism around the world? It\u2019s Saudi Arabia, hands down. And if you say which peoples are probably more likely to come to Western ways and more likely to trade with us, and like, sort of trading with us, it\u2019s probably Iran,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul also slammed the 17-year-old War in Afghanistan, which is costing about $45 billion per year. There are currently about 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan training and advising Afghan forces to fight the Taliban.\n\nHe said the U.S. spent $90 million for a luxury hotel in Kabul seven years ago (reports suggest $85 million) that was never finished and is \u201chalf-empty\u201d today. The hotel is now a danger since the Taliban could use it as a position for their snipers, he said. Now, the Afghan government wants $200,000 to $300,000 to tear it down, he claimed.\n\n\u201cIs that not an insult?\u201d he asked.\n\nIn addition, Paul said the U.S. spent millions on a natural gas station in Afghanistan that is too dangerous to visit. \u201cYou cannot travel in Kabul by car more than a street or two. You go by gunship, if you wanted to visit the natural gas station,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had to go with 300 Marines and they didn\u2019t think it was a wise use of their Marine\u2019s lives to go visit this gas station, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wise use of your money to spend it on a gas station if we can\u2019t even visit it.\u201d\n\nHe said the $45 billion spent in Afghanistan each year could be better spent on U.S. infrastructure. \u201cWhen the president said he wanted a parade, I thought it was a dumb idea, but I said, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m for it if you bring everyone home from Afghanistan, I\u2019ll show up for the parade.'\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t find a foreign policy person, Republican, Democrat or Independent, who thinks there\u2019s a military solution to Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, if you ask them if there\u2019s a military solution to Yemen they don\u2019t think there is. In fact, probably for at least five years, people have been saying there is no military solution to Syria and yet we still react with a military response when we say there is no military solution.\u201d\n\nHe also said the media was also at fault since it favors \u201caction\u201d versus \u201crestraint,\u201d and are too busy focusing on the littlest thing Trump says or does, versus focusing on issues like the War in Yemen.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you step up to the plate, blank network, and talk about real issues?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe slammed both the Republicans and Democrats for their hostility to Russia, which he said prevented necessary work to negotiate weapons treaties. He said Democrats are normally in favor of arms negotiations with Russia, but they think they need to hate Russia because they think President Trump is too friendly with Russia.\n\n\u201cThere truly is a Trump derangement syndrome and they\u2019re caught up in it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that there is a majority of American people who believe as I do and as many of you do that we\u2019ve been at war too long, and in too many places. I think there is a possibility for changing things, and I will continue to agitate for that.\u201d\n\nThe Committee for Responsible Foreign Policy is a 501(c)(4) organization with the mission of pursuing a more restrained foreign policy that adheres to the Constitution.

So you could argue \u2014 not that I would \u2014 that all Boles is really doing here is exposing himself as the kind of out-of-touch, reactionary, patronising, bloviating, pompous, sexist pig that the Conservative Party would like us to think it doesn\u2019t welcome any more.\n\nNow let me present you with exhibit B: an article in today\u2019s Telegraph by a man once spoken of as a future Conservative prime minister \u2014 former party leader William Hague.\n\nHague\u2019s columns are always ineffably dreary and wrong-headed. This one is no exception. Here he is, for example, on Brexit:\n\nCredible, alternative plans to the Brexit deal put forward by the Prime Minister are in short supply. There are plenty of other wishes, hopes, beliefs and passionate speeches, but they are not a plan. By \u201cplan\u201d, I mean something you can actually do, not just want.\n\nWilliam Hague has long marketed himself as a bluff, no-nonsense, straight-talking Yorkshireman who calls a spade a spade. But pretty much every word there is lies, half-truths, and spin.\n\nThe reason there are so few \u201ccredible, alternative plans\u201d to the prime minister\u2019s half-arsed Brexit deal is because she deliberately engineered it that way in cahoots with her civil servants. She didn\u2019t plan for No Deal because, being a Remainer, she never wanted a No Deal. The plan all along \u2014 eagerly embraced by her Brussels counterparts \u2014 was for a Brexit In Name Only \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what she is offering us now.\n\nThat said, contra Hague, there is a credible alternative plan for Brexit. Rees-Mogg, David Davis, and the European Research Group presented a paper on it today.\n\nMy broader point is this. Here are two leading Conservatives, one a prominent backbench MP, one a member of the House of Lords, telling us in their different fancy ways why it is that the government they represent is quite incapable of delivering Brexit.\n\nAnd instead of being embarrassed about it or apologetic they are defiant.\n\nThis is what strikes me as so utterly unforgivable about Theresa May\u2019s useless Conservatives. They\u2019re not all bad, obviously \u2014 the rebel members of the European Research Group being notable exceptions \u2014 but what I find extraordinary is just how utterly oblivious they are to the two values that ought to motivate them above all else: democratic accountability and conservative principles.\n\nLet me deal with democratic accountability first \u2014 and it\u2019s really very simple.\n\nIf you give a referendum to the British people whose result you promise to honour \u2014 and if the result makes it perfectly clear what the people want \u2014 then you cannot in any conscience turn round after the event and go: \u201cActually no. We can\u2019t give you what you asked for because we\u2019re not really convinced you knew what you were doing.\u201d\n\nNow, conservative principles. There are lots of these \u2014 too many to detain us here. But definitely among them are things like \u201cmaintaining the integrity of the United Kingdom\u201d, \u201clooking after the interests of your own people\u201d, \u201ctrying not to be diddled by foreign powers\u201d, \u201cenjoying the benefits of free trade\u201d, \u201cmaking the most of the changing global economy\u201d, \u201cputting Britain first\u201d, and so on. Put it this way, there\u2019s probably not a single Conservative voter who would disagree with any of these aims.\n\nBut guess what? Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May has thrown together a Brexit plan which would shaft every one of these.\n\nAnd guess what else? A significant proportion of her parliamentary party are all over BBC news and social media hailing this abject surrender document as the most glorious and heroic victory since VE Day.\n\nWell, it ain\u2019t. And we can all see it ain\u2019t. Even really stupid people who are so ignorant they don\u2019t even know what houses Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson were in at Eton.\n\nImagine that, eh?\n\nI\u2019m still optimistic by the way. I\u2019m not that bothered if the Tories don\u2019t muster the requisite number of letters needed to call a vote of no confidence in May because I reckon if there were such a vote in the present climate she\u2019d win.\n\nAnd can you imagine how awful that would be? A newly emboldened Theresa May stomping round like the Terminator robot convinced that she now had a stronger mandate than ever for selling out to the EU. It\u2019s too horrible to contemplate.\n\nThe Conservative Party \u2014 at least the parliamentary branch \u2014 is despicable and has been pretty much since Thatcher left. It\u2019s full of cowards, traitors, time-servers, squishes, closet Lib Dems, deranged alcoholic fishwives, and sell-outs with barely a conservative bone in their body.\n\nBut they are still, unfortunately, the best hope we\u2019ve got of getting a decent Brexit.\n\nMy belief is that when push comes to shove and Theresa May\u2019s crappy deal comes before Parliament they\u2019ll vote it down.\n\nAnd then they\u2019ll knife her in the back because it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t know she\u2019s rubbish really. And also because, obviously, if there\u2019s one thing they\u2019re really good at it \u2014 and I respect this, at least \u2014 it\u2019s behaving like unconscionable, double-dealing scumbags."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Chris Tomlinson", "title": "Italy Orders Seizure of Migrant Transport Vessel Accused of Dumping Toxic Medical Waste", "description": "The Italian populist coalition government has ordered the seizure of the migrant transport ship Aquarius after accusing the NGO operating the vessel of dumping toxic materials potentially linked to diseases such as HIV and Tuberculosis.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/11/20/italy-orders-seizure-migrant-transport-vessel-accused-dumping-toxic-material/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/aquarius.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:17:16Z", "content": "The Italians ordered the seizure of the vessel operated by NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which is currently in the French port of Marseille, claiming that MSF had illegally dumped 53,000lbs of waste in 11 different Italian ports, ANSA reports.

Should the CA GOP take advice from a Democratic consultant like Madrid?\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that at no point did Marinucci or Olsen ever take a hard look at how the CA GOP leadership \u2014 those currently pointing fingers at Trump \u2014 personally drove the party into an early grave.\n\nStarting in 2012, GOP Chairman Jim Brulte decided to expand the donor base of the party by inviting the left-wing Service Employees International Union (SEIU) to join the CA GOP in picking off vocal conservatives.\n\nMoreover, it was Brulte who brokered a deal with Charles Munger, Jr.\n\nMunger, the erstwhile son of billionaire Charles Munger, best known as Warren Buffet\u2019s business partner, has attempted to remake the CA GOP in his own image: a weak, bow-tie-wearing version of its former self.\n\nRepublican Party registration began sliding into irrelevancy as soon as Brulte/Munger took over, dropping under 30% and continuing its downward slide on Olsen/Dillon\u2019s watch, bottoming out in 2018 when barely a quarter of the California electorate was willing to identify as Republican.\n\nAfter bailing the CA GOP out of its $3 million debt, Munger dumped about $80 million individually and through his Spirit of Democracy PAC into an effort to transform the GOP into a \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d version of the Democratic Party. Munger funded a civil war between the conservative grassroots activists who make up the party base, and the elitists who make up the donor class.\n\nUsing his money and influence, Munger succeeded in defanging the grassroots by buying control of almost every central committee in each of the 58 counties\u2014seeding some with a few thousand dollars, and pumping close to a million dollars into others.\n\nBy turning the CA GOP into the party of \u201cpale pastels\u201d that Reagan detested, the party ceased to do the most important thing a political party should do: win elections.\n\nUnder the direction of Brulte, the party splintered into two distinct entities, and began to lose everywhere as a house divided \u2014 even races it should have won by a landslide.\n\nBlaming Trump is just a distraction to divert attention away from the latest public relations nightmare of the CA GOP.\n\nThis happened in 2017, when eight Republicans joined the likes of then-State Assembly minority leader Chad Mayes (and rumored deal architect Jay Obernolte) in selling out the Republican stance on climate change and colluding with Gov. Jerry Brown on cap-and-trade renewal.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the CA GOP leadership invested all its political capital in repealing a 12 cent gas tax, while celebrating and defending the \u2018Swamp 8\u2019 even as they were derided statewide on talk radio.\n\nThe Democrats handily turned the \u201cGas Tax Repeal\u201d into the \u201cRoad Repair Repeal\u201d and crushed the feckless GOP at the ballot box.\n\nThe so-called leaders of the CA GOP refused to heed the one unifying message that Steve Bannon delivered at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2017, right after President Trump took office: namely, that when the Republican establishment and the conservative base work together, we cannot be defeated.\n\nThe inverse of that is that if we fail to work together, we cannot win.\n\nWhatever rises from the ashes of the party that birthed the gold standard of Republicanism \u2014 Ronald Reagan \u2014 must understand that the only way to win from the super minority is to wage the kind of political guerrilla warfare waged by the Founders.\n\nAs Samuel Adams said: \u201cIt does not take a majority to prevail\u2026 but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.\u201d\n\nRather than taking the easy road and blaming Trump for its woes, the CA GOP leadership should take a hard look in the mirror, unanimously resign in shame \u2014 and let a real leader step up and take charge.\n\nOnly then will there be any hope for the party of real \u201cResistance\u201d to rise again and become an effective opposition in the People\u2019s Republic of California."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Ben Kew", "title": "Rob Reiner Melts Down over Trump: \u2018Ignorant, Criminal, Mentally Unstable, Racist\u2019", "description": "Film director Rob Reiner used his Twitter account to unload on President Donald Trump on Tuesday morning, insulting him with nearly every derogatory term used in modern politics.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/11/20/rob-reiner-melts-down-over-trump-ignorant-criminal-mentally-unstable-racist/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/RobReiner2.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:16:13Z", "content": "\u201cHypocritical.

I stand in Solidarity with all the Sister March Organizations, to bring the Movement back to its authentic purpose. As Women\u2019s March founder, I am stepping up to bring focus back to the Unity Principles on which our movement began, and with the support of all of those who marched and have continued to march, I pledge to support grassroots, decentralized leadership promoting a safe, worldwide community devoid of hate speech, bigotry and racism.\u201d\n\nIt took less than two hours for the Women\u2019s March to respond on its Facebook page, thanking Shook for her \u201ccontribution to our movement\u201d but chiding her for \u201cirresponsibly\u201d speaking out against the leftist activists behind the march.\n\nThe post admits that the Women\u2019s March has \u201ccaused harm\u201d and \u201churt\u201d but pledged to continue its anti-Trump activism.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for people who HAVE been with us for the past two years, wrestling with the challenges and opportunities of what we are trying to build,\u201d the Women\u2019s March Facebook post said. \u201cOur ongoing work speaks for itself.

I\u2019m disappointed in the leadership of the Women\u2019s March that they haven\u2019t done it adequately,\u201d Milano said.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, Mallory was criticized for not speaking out after she attended an event during which Farrakhan said \u2018The powerful Jews are my enemy,\u2019\u201d Haaretz reported, noting that Sarsour eventually defended Mallory.\n\n\u201cI will not sit back while a strong, bold, unapologetic, committed Black woman who risks her life every day to speak truth to power and organize and mobilize movements is questioned, berated and abused,\u201d Sarsour wrote on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI stand with Tamika Mallory every day, with every fiber of my being because she has so much of what we need in the movement right now to win.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "John Carney", "title": "Futures Market Says Trump Is Right about the Fed and Interest Rates", "description": "The Fed said it expected to hike rates three times in 2019.

Since then, it appears that the factory has not done very much despite costing New York taxpayers $750 million to fund the construction of the production plant. In an article titled \u201cDid Elon Musk Forget About Buffalo?\u201d Bloomberg takes a look inside the Tesla facility. Bloomberg states:\n\nTesla has presented the Buffalo operation as a sort of sequel to the Gigafactory, the company\u2019s enormous battery plant near Reno, Nev. But where that factory employs more than 7,000 people and has helped Musk transform Tesla into a major automotive manufacturer, large portions of Gigafactory 2, as this place is known, resemble an empty Walmart Supercenter. Tesla was supposed to be operating multiple production lines by now. Only one is set up, and it\u2019s not yet fully automated. A mess of wooden crates filled with unused manufacturing equipment sits nearby.\n\nTesla has reportedly even taken to erecting walls inside the Buffalo plant to prevent journalists from seeing the full extent of idled machinery sitting on the factory floor:\n\nFor the factory tour Tesla gave Bloomberg Businessweek in mid-November, a knowledgeable source says the company erected a wall inside the building to block much of its idle machinery from view. Tesla says certain parts of the factory contain confidential operations.\n\nIt would seem that many are growing tired of Musk\u2019s usual gameplan of using taxpayer money to fund his various ventures and facilities. But Musk appears to have one ardent defender in the form of Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo:\n\nAlthough Tesla\u2019s main patron, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, easily won reelection, his opponents have pointed to the Gigafactory 2 deal as a sign of his coziness with moneyed interests. Raymond Walter, a Republican in the New York State Assembly who lost his own reelection bid, says he\u2019s concerned the state has too many \u201ceggs in the Tesla basket, which doesn\u2019t seem like a very strong basket at this point.\u201d When Walter toured the factory in March, he recalls, \u201cit was mostly empty. I would say 10 percent to 15 percent of the floor was being utilized for production. It was not an impressive use of $750 million in taxpayer funds.\u201d\n\nTesla also appears to have failed on their promise to bring more jobs to the area, despite holding job fairs and promising the employment of over a thousand workers, the factory has failed to live up to local resident\u2019s hopes:\n\nOn the other side of the country, workers at the Buffalo Gigafactory were wondering whether it would ever mass-produce anything. From late 2016, when Tesla started holding job fairs at local schools and churches, to the fall of 2017, according to more than a half-dozen former employees, the factory was basically a ghost town, a smattering of people occupying what felt like a chain of airplane hangars. At some points, thousands of massive crates of unused machinery crowded the floors. Tesla declined to comment on the number of crates; the company says there were hundreds of employees in the facility by late 2017.\n\nRead the full article in Bloomberg here.\n\nUpdate \u2014 A Tesla spokesperson provided the following statement about the Buffalo factory to Breitbart News: \u201cTesla is committed to building great products, and Solar Roof is no exception. We are building a product that needs to last decades, and we\u2019ve been very transparent about the fact that we are being thoughtful and deliberate as we gradually ramp up Solar Roof and the pace of production in Buffalo. As we\u2019ve said publicly, we have already started installations and we intend to ramp Solar Roof production in 2019, as well as the continued buildout of Gigafactory 2. We are committed to our continued work with the State of New York and are already significantly above the 2018-2019 employment targets for our efforts in Buffalo with roughly 800 full time employees.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Warner Todd Huston", "title": "Arkansas Suspends Two Players for Fraternizing with Mississippi State Dance Team", "description": "The University of Arkansas has suspended defensive backs Ryan Pulley and Kamren Curl for fraternizing with members of the Mississippi State dance team last weekend.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2018/11/20/arkansas-suspends-two-players-for-fraternizing-with-mississippi-state-dace-team/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/AP-Samantha-Baker.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:01:24Z", "content": "Pulley and Curl apparently left their area, approached the Mississippi dancers,and began chatting them up.

Public health officials hope to better understand what triggers the perplexing condition often characterized by paralysis.\n\nAFM is not a new disease. It targets the body\u2019s nervous system, specifically the spinal cord. According to the CDC, it begins with weakness in the arms or legs. Other symptoms include muscle tone loss, impaired or absent reflexes, facial weakness, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, breathing and/or swallowing difficulties, and gastrointestinal infections. AFM can lead to paralysis and death. CDC officials said no deaths have been reported this year.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s November Morbidity and Mortality Report identified the median age of confirmed AFM patients as four years old. It found 59 percent of cases were male and 86 percent were Caucasian. Most of these patients had a fever and respiratory ailments like coughing or congestion several weeks before they exhibited AFM-like symptoms. Others experienced vomiting and diarrhea. Approximately 48 percent reported weakness in their upper limbs, nearly nine percent had issues with lower limbs, and almost 29 percent had weakness in all four limbs.\n\nIn 2014, AFM cases spiked at 120 cases in 34 states. One year later, the CDC confirmed 22 cases in 17 states. In 2016, they identified 149 cases in 39 states. Last year, the CDC accounted for 33 cases in 16 states.\n\nAlthough the CDC does not know what causes AFM, medical experts have noted cases often coincide with incidences of the potentially deadly respiratory enterovirus (EVD-68). While most EVD-68 symptoms range from a mild cough and fever to a runny nose some patients experience uncharacteristic partial paralysis.\n\nRecently, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the agency\u2019s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, said, this year, they have not seen any increases in EVD-68 or other enteroviruses that may be related to AFM.

Further, asylum is a discretionary benefit given by the Executive Branch only when legal conditions are met and a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted. It is lawful and appropriate that this discretionary benefit not be given to those who violate a lawful and tailored presidential proclamation aimed at controlling immigration in the national interest. And it is absurd that a set of advocacy groups can be found to have standing to sue to stop the entire federal government from acting so that illegal aliens can receive a government benefit to which they are not entitled. We look forward to continuing to defend the Executive Branch\u2019s legitimate and well-reasoned exercise of its authority to address the crisis at our southern border.\n\nThe appeal will likely be decided at the Supreme Court.\n\nDistrict Judge Jon Tigar, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, argues that the president\u2019s authority over the border is insufficient to limit migrants\u2019 right to be allowed into the United States to ask for asylum \u2014 even when the migrants are simply seeking jobs and illegally cross the border carrying children to trigger catch-and-release laws.\n\nAccording to USA Today:\n\nThe 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act states that any foreigner who arrives in the USA, \u201cwhether or not at a designated port of arrival,\u201d may apply for asylum. But on Nov. 9, Trump tried to overrule that law, signing a presidential proclamation ending the ability of migrants to request asylum if they enter the country illegally. \u201cThe rule barring asylum for immigrants who enter the country outside a port of entry irreconcilably conflicts with the INA and the expressed intent of Congress,\u201d wrote Tigar, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama. \u201cWhatever the scope of the President\u2019s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden.\u201d\n\nTigar declared that the agencies cannot implement Trump\u2019s border reforms until at least Dec. 19, when he is expected to deliver his final decision.\n\nIn response, the DoJ and DHS officials noted that the same 1965 act gives the president broad authority to exclude people from the United States:\n\nSection 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act states plainly: \u201cWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d Section 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act similarly states: \u201cUnless otherwise ordered by the President, it shall be unlawful . . . for any alien to depart from or enter or attempt to depart from or enter the United States except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may prescribe.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s November 9 reform allows all migrants who arrive at the ports of entry to apply for full asylum. But the policy penalizes illegal migrants by preventing them from applying for a full asylum once they are caught sneaking over the border.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan allows illegal migrants to apply for a limited asylum, dubbed \u201cwithholding of removal.\u201d Officials say the reform follows the law by providing asylum-like protections to illegal migrants, but it does not allow the migrants to become citizens It also helps border officials quickly deport the migrants.\n\nThe ACLU and its allies argue that all migrants who enter U.S. territory must be allowed to make a request for a full asylum \u2014 even if the U.S. territory is on the Mexican side of the border wall or is in the U.S. half of the Rio Grande.\n\nThis ACLU\u2019s one-foot-asylum policy would help large groups of economic migrants \u2014 such as the progressive-backed caravan of several thousand Hondurans \u2014 legally overwhelm U.S. border defenses. For example, on November 12 and 13, coyotes delivered 654 migrants, most of whom are parents with children, or youths traveling alone, to the U.S. side of the border near Yuma Arizona, according to a DHS statement. Once on U.S. territory, the illegal migrants ask for asylum \u2014 and often get catch-and-release if the local border officials do not have enough detention space.\n\nOverall, Trump\u2019s asylum reform curbs the caravan by pressuring the migrants to wait in line at the official \u201cports of entry,\u201d rather than by just walking over the invisible borderline in the sand or the river to claim amnesty.\n\nAt the same time, officials are also limiting the number of migrants who can apply for asylum each day at the official ports of entry.\n\nThe waiting process, dubbed \u201cmetering,\u201d allows officials to begin processing roughly 100 migrants per day. The complex legal process takes at least 40 days to accomplish, so an intake of 100 people per day adds up to roughly 4,000 people in detention from one entry point.\n\nThe metering process allows officials to keep a manageable number of people in the process, and to perhaps sharply reduce the number of migrants who are being released into the United States via the catch-and-release loopholes.\n\nEnding catch-and-release is vital because it would stop migrants from getting the U.S. jobs which fund the migration process. Without access to jobs, migrants cannot pay their smuggling debts to the cartels, and cannot hire the cartels to bring their spouses and children up to the United States. If the migrants cannot pay their smuggling debts, the cartels\u2019 labor-trafficking business will shrink.\n\nThe catch-and-release rules are enforced by a 2015 decision by an Obama-appointed judge who declared that migrants with children must be released from detention after 20 days \u2014 or three weeks before border officials can complete the deportation process.\n\nThe ACLU and its allies filed the lawsuit against Trump\u2019s asylum reforms. They are also asking a different judge to stop the metering process.\n\nThe establishment\u2019s economic policy of using migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nImmigration also pulls investment and wealth away from heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations living in the coastal states"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "John Nolte", "title": "Nolte: Walmart Demands GOP Sen.

The groups, consisting of nearly 100 family units and unaccompanied minors, surrendered to Border Patrol agents after they illegally entered the U.S. from Mexico in two separate incidents.\n\nAgents assigned to the Weslaco Border Patrol Station came upon a large group of migrants on the morning of November 17. The group assembled after being shuttled across the Rio Grande River by cartel-connected human smugglers. A group of 43 illegal immigrants from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador surrendered to the agents, according to information provided by Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials on Monday evening. The agents took the migrants into custody and transported them to the station where they will be processed under sector guidelines.\n\nThursday evening, Weslaco Station agents encountered another group of 51 migrants who illegally crossed the border. This group also consisted of family units and unaccompanied children, officials said. They traveled to the U.S. through Mexico from the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.\n\nOfficials with the Rio Grande Valley Sector told Breitbart News on Tuesday morning that these migrant groups are not part of the \u201cmigrant caravan\u201d who are currently making their way from Central America through Mexico.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on November 1 that asylum requests would be denied to migrants who illegally crossed the border between ports of entry, Breitbart News\u2019 Neil Munro reported. In part, the proclamation stated:\n\nThe entry of any alien into the United States across the international boundary between the United States and Mexico is hereby suspended and limited \u2026 this proclamation shall not apply to any alien who enters the United States at a port of entry and properly presents for inspection, or to any lawful permanent resident of the United States.\n\nDHS officials told Breitbart News late last week that migrants who were apprehended after illegally crossing the border between ports of entry would be detained for up to 20 days. During this time, the migrants would be under an expedited removal process and would have an immigration hearing before being returned to their country of origin.\n\nHowever, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Trump administration. ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said that people cross the border between ports of entry because \u201cthey\u2019re in real danger.\u201d He explained that danger might be in their own country or in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t condone people entering between ports of entry, but Congress has made the decision that if they do, they still need to be allowed to apply for asylum,\u201d Gelernt stated.\n\nOn Monday evening, U.S. District Court Judge Jon S. Tigar, an Obama appointee from the San Francisco Division of the Northern District of California, issued a temporary restraining order to block the execution of the president\u2019s proclamation.\n\nThe president\u2019s proclamation included a clause aimed at sharply curbing Mexican cartel\u2019s ability to traffic children and minors into the U.S.\n\n\u201cSince 2016, cartel-affiliated coyotes have used the nation\u2019s lax asylum laws to deliver more than 110,000 children and youths from Central America to the United States,\u201d Munro reported. \u201cThe government-aided business has been hidden by media and by Democrats who portray the expensively smuggled young migrants as \u2018Unaccompanied Alien Children.'\u201d\n\nThe policy would remove the nearly automatic approval of asylum requests for those children who were illegally crossed from Mexico into the U.S. between ports of entry by the cartels who control most illegal border crossings in Texas and Arizona. The \u201cWithholding of Removal\u201d status would block the delivery of these children to potential employers, illegal alien parents, or other parties, Munro wrote. The policy could have prevented cartels from getting paid and reduce the number of children being subjected to the dangers of being smuggled by the cartels.\n\nIn the meantime, thousands of caravan migrants continue to arrive in Tijuana, Mexico, Breitbart News\u2019 Robert Arce reported. More than 3,000 arrived on November 17 to join those already queuing up to cross the border into the U.S.\n\nThe massive numbers of migrants arriving in Tijuana sparked fierce protests from Mexican citizens who were offended by the migrants\u2019 disregard for Mexican law. On Sunday, protesters took to the streets chanting calls of \u201ckick them out,\u201d Breitbart Border/Cartel Chronicles editor-in-chief Brandon Darby and border journalist Ildefonso Ortiz reported.

When written well by great creators such as Stan Lee, they make us feel, make us think and teach us lessons that hopefully make us better human beings,\u201d the letter read. \u201cOne lesson Stan taught so many of us was tolerance and respect, and thanks to that message, we are grateful that we can say you have a right to your opinion that comics are childish and unsophisticated.\u201d\n\nThe letter continued:\n\nBut to say that Stan merely inspired people to \u201cwatch a movie\u201d is in our opinion frankly disgusting. Countless people can attest to how Stan inspired them to read, taught them that the world is not made up of absolutes, that heroes can have flaws and even villains can show humanity within their souls. He gave us the X-Men, Black Panther, Spider-Man and many other heroes and stories that offered hope to those who felt different and bullied while inspiring countless to be creative and dream of great things to come. These are but a few of the things we the fans of Stan Lee also consider \u201cadulting,\u201d because life both as a child and grown-up can indeed be a struggle. Stan is the author of millions of happy childhood memories and the provider of so many of the positive tools of adulthood.

According to Australia\u2019s SBS, a crowd of 200 protesters organized at Manila\u2019s Chinese embassy with signs reading \u201cPhilippines not for sale!\u201d and \u201cChina out of Philippine waters!\u201d\n\nPhotos via Getty Images\n\nOpposition lawmakers and other public officials also demanded that Duterte abandon his submissive approach towards China \u2013 Duterte has repeatedly claimed he cannot challenge China because its military is too powerful \u2013 and defend his country.\n\n\u201cWe demand President Duterte to assert and uphold the favorable ruling of the international tribunal in The Hague which recognized the exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea as President Xi Jinping of China arrives in the Philippines,\u201dACT Teachers Rep. Antonio Tinio said in a statement issued in anticipation of Xi\u2019s arrival.\n\nActing Chief Justice Antonio Carpio also issued remarks condemning Xi\u2019s opinion piece in Philippine media, which alleged that a 14th-century Chinese explorer had visited the Philippines, an attempt to lend legitimacy to China\u2019s claims in the region. Carpio asserted that the explorer, Zheng He, \u201cnever visited the Philippines.\u201d Xi and his regime have repeatedly used fabricated ancient and medieval claims to justify their invasion of the South China Sea.\n\nAt press time, the Duterte government appears not to have heeded any of the calls for defiance from the Philippine people. The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday that allows China to explore for oil and gas in the Philippine South China Sea, which allegedly reads that this exploration \u201cshall not affect the respective position on sovereignty and maritime rights and interests of the two parties.\u201d Xi has also promised increased Chinese aid to the Philippines \u201cin many forms,\u201d including infrastructure development and security.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Dr. Susan Berry", "title": "Taxpayers to Fund More Abortions in 2019 in Obamacare State Plans", "description": "Americans will be funding increasingly more elective abortions through Obamacare state exchange plans unless Congress passes the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Law, says Family Research Council (FRC).", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/20/taxpayers-to-fund-more-abortions-in-2019-in-obamacare-state-plans/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/abortion.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:57:00Z", "content": "American taxpayers are funding even more abortions on demand in 2019 than they did this past year through Obamacare state exchange plans even if their states opt out of elective abortion coverage.

That\u2019s just the nature of the Obamacare tax credits.\u201d\n\nWhile most Americans know their tax dollars are funding Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, many are not aware taxpayer monies are funding abortion on demand in Obamacare state exchange plans offered at healthcare.gov.\n\nEach year, FRC and the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) \u2013 the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List \u2013 conduct a comprehensive review of elective abortion coverage in individual and family health insurance plans offered on Obamacare state exchanges.\n\nIn the most recent review, the two groups discovered that 650 Obamacare state exchange plans cover abortion on demand in 2019 \u2013 a 23 percent increase over 2018. According to FRC and CLI, of all the Obamacare exchange plans in the 24 states and the District of Columbia that permit abortion coverage, about 65 percent (650 plans) cover elective abortion \u2013 an increase from 53 percent (527 plans) in 2018.\n\nCLI president Chuck Donovan noted the review reveals \u201cconsumers across nearly half the country have even fewer pro-life policy options to choose from on their state health insurance exchanges in 2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn several states and the District of Columbia, there are no pro-life plans offered at all,\u201d he continued. \u201cGiven this pathetic situation, consumers at least deserve transparency as they shop the exchange for plans for themselves or their families.\u201d\n\nA 2019 fact sheet with detailed information and an interactive map are available online at ObamacareAbortion.com to help consumers find pro-life health plans.\n\nThe two pro-life groups provide some additional findings for 2019.\n\nIn eight states (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont, and Washington) and the District of Columbia, for example, 100 percent of individual and family plans on the exchange cover elective abortion. No pro-life options are available in these jurisdictions.\n\nIn an additional five states (Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, and Rhode Island), between 54 and 93 percent of plans cover elective abortion. In Connecticut, for example, 93 percent of the state exchange plans cover elective abortion, with only one pro-life plan in existence.\n\nAccording to the two pro-life groups, 26 states (see fact sheet) have passed laws to opt out of elective abortion coverage in plans offered on the state exchange.\n\nWhile these states have passed pro-life laws to ensure abortion on demand is not included in any of the plans sold on their state Obamacare exchanges\u200b, their taxpayers are still paying federal taxes the federal government uses to pay for elective abortion coverage in the other states that allow it (tax credits).\n\nThe Trump Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently released a new rule that directs those who sell Obamacare health insurance plans that allow coverage for elective abortions to collect a separate payment for that coverage \u2013 as is required by law. The Obama administration, however, failed to enforce that law and allowed collection of fees for abortion coverage together with regular premiums.\n\n\u201cThanks to this trickery, millions of Americans have unwittingly purchased plans without knowing about the hidden abortion surcharge,\u201d said Susan B. Anthony president Marjorie Dannenfelser. \u201cConsumers deserve to know how Obamacare pays for abortion so they can avoid having their hard-earned dollars used to fund the destruction of innocent lives.\u201d\n\n\u200bPatrina Mosely, FRC director of life, culture and women\u2019s advocacy, noted that as the two groups updated the Obamacare Abortion website, they discovered \u201cthe unfortunate reality\u201d that \u201cthings have gotten worse.\u201d\n\nShe added:\n\nDuring the Obama administration we saw broken promises, a lack of transparency and adherence to the law, and a healthcare system that was programmed in such a way that it would continue to fund abortion coverage long after President Obama left office. No matter the transparency or lack thereof, ObamaCare is still forcing Americans to choose between their healthcare and their conscience. Abortion is not healthcare and the majority of Americans do not want their hard-earned tax dollars subsidizing insurance coverage that includes the taking of unborn human life.\n\nFRC notes that since Republicans did not repeal Obamacare when they had full control of Congress and the White House, they have incentive now to pass the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion law."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Ildefonso Ortiz and Brandon Darby", "title": "Tijuana Police Arrest 34 Caravan Migrants for Drugs, Drunkenness", "description": "Local police officers in Tijuana arrested 34 caravan migrants for misdemeanor charges including drug possession and public drunkenness.

No question. And it is unfortunate they are part of an organization that grows more reprehensible by the day, but come on\u2026\n\nBiases up front\u2026 I have never been a big Fox News fan. My original prejudice, however, was based on my initial disgust with the overall cable news format, which is to ruin your day with nonsense outrage. Honestly, when you\u2019re walking around angry all day because some bureaucrat in Dumbassqua, Ohio, won\u2019t allow some retiree to paint his house trailer red, white, and blue \u2014 seriously, come on. Cable news is dumb.\n\nBut at least in those days, Fox News was still Fox News \u2014 a rebel, a loner, a badass totally in touch with Real America. At least in those days, Fox News was on our side, was a proudly belligerent finger in the eye of the establishment media. So, yeah, that was worth something, maybe even worth $150 a month cable bill. But now?\n\nNow\u2026?\n\nWake up, y\u2019all\u2026 What you are now paying for is to watch the slow-motion suicide of Fox News as it sells you out and hopes you don\u2019t notice. What you are now paying for is being the sucker who stands by your Fox Man as he openly cheats on you with a sleazy creep like Jim Acosta.\n\nThis is Fox News today:\n\nCalled the U.S. House of Representatives race for the Democrats 90 minutes before polls closed in California, which might have cost the Republicans a number of close House seats.\n\nBacked CNN\u2019s lawsuit against President Trump to reinstate a press pass for heckler Jim Acosta.\n\nBuckled to emotional blackmail from CNN and others and stopped airing Trump\u2019s perfectly acceptable ad about the dangers of illegal immigration.\n\nOffered a platform to Jorge Ramos, a left-wing propagandist and open borders extremist.\n\nMocked an actor for working a real job.\n\nSpread the fake news that Senate Judiciary Committee testimony from Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford was \u201cexceptionally credible\u201d \u2014 when the truth is that Ford\u2019s testimony and documentation were riddled with contradictionsand falsehoods.\n\nAttacked Breitbart News after we uncovered smoking gun audio about Google\u2019s election meddling.\n\nThat list doesn\u2019t even include Shepard Smith\u2019s hour of left-wing editorializing or the latest anti-Trump jibberish spewed by Judge Napalotano.\n\nBut there is only ONE way to fire Fox News \u2014 and NOT watching is NOT the way.\n\nYou see, the whole cable/satellite TV game is rigged \u2014 rigged to rob you, to vacuum hard-earned dollars out of your pocket as a means to subsidize your own destruction.\n\nHere is why your cable bill is so obnoxiously expensive: Whether or not you watch CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, MTV, ESPN, and a bunch of other outlets that hate you, you are still subsidizing them.\n\nLet me repeat that.\n\nEven if you refuse to watch CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, MTV, ESPN, and a bunch of other outlets that hate you, every single month, through your cable payment, you are sending them money, you are subsidizing them, you are giving them the power to destroy you.\n\nIt is called a carriage fee, and you pay it every month, and that is why it doesn\u2019t matter if no one watches CNN. And because of these carriage fees, advertising revenue based on actual merit (viewership ratings) hardly matter anymore.\n\nAccording to the latest numbers, whether or not you watch, here is how much money these left-wing companies receive from you every month:\n\nNow multiply that by some 80 million cable subscribers and the answer you get is WHO NEEDS VIEWERS!

He spoke with Breitbart News Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight.\n\nCaddell, a former contributor to Fox News Channel, said, \u201cFox News, the supposed voice for conservative Republicans, announced that Democrats won the House before the actual evidence was in hand and while people in California and other states were still voting.\u201d\n\nMansour replied, \u201cI believe that really had an effect. This was early in the day. People were just getting out of work when Fox called the House for the Democrats. In Orange County, we lost it.\u201d\n\nCaddell noted, \u201cLook how many races in California were lost by a hair. Even with that crazy mail-in system that always keeps voting and voting and voting, which is another thing, but how many seats were so close that [Republicans] lost? What I don\u2019t understand is this would never have happened with Roger Ailes running Fox. They pledged, all of them including Fox, not to call elections while people were still voting; the national outcome.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\nPollak noted that only Fox News prematurely projected a Democrat House majority. \u201cEven CNN didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cCNN and MSNBC, they would love to see Republicans lose, and they didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nCaddell remarked, \u201cI wanted to ask [Jason Chaffetz] \u2014 who quit his seat to be a commentator on Fox \u2014 whether anyone that night raised any hell about this at Fox about doing this [or] allowing this. If I was still at Fox, I would have taken the roof off the building. They made a pledge not to do this stuff. Nobody writes an article. Why hasn\u2019t Breitbart or someone gone to Fox and said, \u2018Who made this decision to do this?\u2019 It violates the agreement that you and all the networks made after 2000 with the Congress on the pledge they took not to do these things, calling elections while the polls are still open.'\u201d\n\nDuring the eve of 2000\u2019s presidential election, television networks wrongly projected Al Gore as the winner of Florida while voters were still voting in the state\u2019s panhandle. Then-Washington Times writer Bill Sammon described the events, \u201cTV networks helped Mr. Gore exploit the debacle in Florida with a bad call that pre-empted Bush voters in the western panhandle.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, the television networks pledged to withhold projections until after polls close.\n\nMansour said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they haven\u2019t been held liable for it. Is it because Republicans are so reliant on Fox News that they don\u2019t want to hold Fox News accountable for this?\u201d\n\nCaddell responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know. When Fox News really screws them, when the Murdoch sons really put it to Fox, or Bill Salmon or whoever was responsible, they decided it\u2019s a cute thing to do. And nobody gets up. I haven\u2019t heard a Republican congressman, leader, or news media go after Fox on this. It\u2019s a huge story.\u201d\n\nMansour noted Breitbart\u2019s Monday publication of, \u201cDid Fox News Cost the GOP Orange County?\u201c, in which Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte examined Fox News\u2019s calling of the election results 90 minutes before polls closed in California. Nolte wrote, \u201cNearly 90 minutes before polls closed in California, Fox Newschose to make the irresponsible announcement that Republicans had already lost the U.S. House of Representatives. Did that early call cost the Republicans Orange County, California?\n\nNolte highlighted several tight races in California, asking if Fox News\u2019s premature projection discouraged California voters from voting on election day:\n\nIn the 28th District, Democrat Linda Sanchez beat Republican Ryan Downing by less than 300 votes. Out of over 140,000 votes cast in the 39th District, the Democrat won by only a little over 4,000 votes with 51.4 percent. This race was so close, it was not called until November 17. In the 45th District, the margin was 51.6 to 48.4 percent with a margin of under 9000 votes out of some 280,000. With margins such as these, it is not unreasonable to ask if Fox News suppressed the Republican vote with its indefensible Election Night call. While Democrat voters prefer early voting, it is well known that Republican voters tend to vote on Election Day \u2014 which means those after-work hours are crucially important when it comes to turnout. But for a crucial 87 minutes, between 6:33 p.m. local time, when Fox announced the election for the U.S. House of representatives was over, and 8:00 p.m., when the polls closed, Orange County was told that voting in an important national race that might have been a motivating factor to get in or remain in line, was futile. Media outlets are supposed to wait until all the polls have closed before calling a race, supposed to wait until all the votes have been cast. For a host of reasons no one should have to explain, this is not only considered good manners, it is an easy way for the media to avoid meddling in elections by discouraging voter participation.\n\nPollak similarly questioned Fox News\u2019s decision the evening of the election in an article entitled, \u201cCritics Question Fox News Calling Election for Democrats with California Polls Still Open.\u201d He wrote, \u201cFox News called the U.S. House of Representatives for the Democrats on Tuesday night just after 9:30 p.m. EST \u2014 with polls still open in California for nearly an hour and a half. \u2026 Fox News\u2019 early call may have discouraged voters from participating in California \u2014 and in other western states whose polls remained open.\u201d\n\nCaddell declared, \u201cThey need to answer for this. That\u2019s the problem with the Republicans. You know what my theory is, they would rather lose than win as long as they get rewarded by their consultants. Their little clique in Washington wasn\u2019t unhappy to lose the House. They don\u2019t know how to fight. Only Trump, apparently, knows how to fight.\u201d\n\n\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "John Carney", "title": "Stocks Crushed: Dow Falls 550 Points, Retail and Tech Wrecked", "description": "The stock market plunged in the first hour of trading after retailers reported disappointing quarterly results.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2018/11/20/stocks-crushed-dow-falls-550-points-retail-and-tech-wrecked/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/wi/ap/29/adf6b6_financial-markets-wall-street-41752-james-denaro-file-in-oct-23-2018-file-e1542727717894.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:29:47Z", "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 585 points.

Phil Bryant in April to replace Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS), who resigned for health reasons, will be sufficient to propel Espy to an upset victory next week.\n\nRepublicans, however, are not taking a Hyde-Smith victory for granted.\n\nOn Monday, President Trump will hold two rallies in the state, one in Tupelo, another in Biloxi.\n\nThe November 27 runoff election was set up by the November 6 general election in which neither Hyde-Smith nor Espy obtained the required 50 percent of the votes needed to win the seat outright.\n\nHyde-Smith received 41 percent of the vote, Espy received 40 percent, and Republican State Senator Chris McDaniel, who narrowly lost the 2014 runoff primary to Cochran, received 16 percent.\n\nIn the two weeks since that election, most of the money that has come into the election has come in opposition to Espy, as the Clarion Ledger reported:\n\nNational GOP heavyweights, business leaders and state political leaders have rallied around Hyde-Smith as the appointed U.S. senator seeks to make her temporary assignment a full-time post. Hyde-Smith has raised nearly $362,000 since the runoff, with notable donors including former Gov. Haley Barbour and Ken Kendrick, owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. . . Although Espy launched his U.S. Senate bid with a $100,000 self-loan, he proved his fundraising power in short time by raising more than $1 million in three months. What\u2019s more, he narrowly out-raised Hyde-Smith during the same quarter. Fundraising numbers show contributions to Espy have topped $370,000 since the runoff. Actress Chelsea Handler and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick are among the notable out-of-state contributors. Outside spending since Nov. 6 Money spent supporting Hyde-Smith: $65,677\n\nMoney spent supporting Espy: $59,515\n\nMoney spent against Espy: $2.68 million\n\nMoney spent against Hyde-Smith: $507,900\n\nDemocrats are hoping that the November 27 runoff election in Mississippi will have the same outcome as the December 2017 special Senate election in Alabama, where Democrat Doug Jones pulled off a stunning upset over the Republican candidate, the embattled Judge Roy Moore.\n\nIn Alabama the entire Republican establishment abandoned Moore. In Mississippi this cycle, however, the Republican establishment is fully in support of Hyde-Smith.\n\nWith 99 of 100 Senate seats in the 116th Congress already decided, Republicans currently hold a 52 to 47 advantage.

Tigar of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, a Barack Obama appointee, blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s new asylum policy on Monday night.\n\nOn Nov. 9, two days after the midterm election, the president issued a proclamation in response to the \u201ccaravan\u201d of thousands of migrants traveling from Central America across Mexico to claim asylum in the U.S. (The date is notable, since Trump\u2019s critics claims his concerns about the caravan were merely an election ploy.)\n\nIn the proclamation, Trump said that his administration would no longer honor requests for political asylum unless migrants entered the U.S. legally, through a port of entry:\n\nCrossing the border to avoid detection and then, if apprehended, claiming a fear of persecution is in too many instances an avenue to near-automatic release into the interior of the United States. \u2026 I am similarly acting to suspend, for a limited period, the entry of certain aliens in order to address the problem of large numbers of aliens traveling through Mexico to enter our country unlawfully or without proper documentation. I am tailoring the suspension to channel these aliens to ports of entry, so that, if they enter the United States, they do so in an orderly and controlled manner instead of unlawfully. Under this suspension, aliens entering through the southern border, even those without proper documentation, may, consistent with this proclamation, avail themselves of our asylum system, provided that they properly present themselves for inspection at a port of entry. \u2026 But aliens who enter the United States unlawfully through the southern border in contravention of this proclamation will be ineligible to be granted asylum under the regulation promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security that became effective earlier today. Those aliens may, however, still seek other forms of protection from persecution or torture.\n\nThe proclamation created what was possibly the most effective deterrent to illegal crossings \u2014 more so than troops deployed along the border, or even a wall, because neither of those two deterrents could stop a migrant from claiming the legal right to stay in the country pending the adjudication of an asylum request.\n\nBut Judge Tigar issued a temporary restraining order, valid until Dec. 19, blocking the administration from implementing Trump\u2019s new policy, saying it conflicted with existing immigration law.\n\n\u201cWhatever the scope of the President\u2019s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\u201d Tigar reportedly said.\n\nPresident Obama routinely used \u2014 or abused \u2014 executive authority to create immigration policies that were against the express intent of Congress, most notably in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nThe Trump administration canceled that policy, but its cancelation was likewise blocked by the courts and is still pending final adjudication.\n\nJoel B.

During the 2000 presidential election, a number of news outlets not only called Florida an hour before the conservative-leaning Panhandle\u2019s polls closed, they called it wrong for Al Gore.\n\nWhile we will never know if Fox\u2019s early call on November 6 cost the GOP Orange County, we do know it was anti-democratic, wildly irresponsible, and another in a ever-growing list of lapses of judgment the cable news network has made of late.\n\nIn just last few months, Fox News has\u2026\n\nBacked CNN\u2019s lawsuit against President Trump to reinstate a press pass for heckler Jim Acosta.\n\nBuckled to emotional blackmail from CNN and others and stopped airing Trump\u2019s perfectly acceptable ad about the dangers of illegal immigration.\n\nOffered a platform to Jorge Ramos, a left-wing propagandist and open borders extremist.\n\nMocked an actor for working a real job.\n\nSpread the fake news that Senate Judiciary Committee testimony from Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford was \u201cexceptionally credible\u201d \u2014 when the truth is that Ford\u2019s testimony and documentation were riddled with contradictions and falsehoods.\n\nAttacked Breitbart News after we uncovered smoking gun audio about Google\u2019s election meddling.\n\nFox News appears to be moving to the left, towards becoming a more establishment news outlet, which would be a massive mistake.\n\nIf news consumers want to be lied to about illegal immigration, want to see working people mocked, want to be misled about Christine Blasey Ford, want to see an obnoxious leftist like Acosta defended in court, what to see the truth about immigration declared racist, or want to see Republican voter suppression in action, they have a whole lot of other options.\n\nFox News is surrendering, not only its Middle America identity, but what makes it unique in an already over-crowded marketplace.\n\nWhat is the point of watching Fox News if it is more interested in earning the affection of its enemies at CNN than those of its loyal viewers?\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

These were preliminary talks, and no agreement was reached on any issue. The representatives of Islamic Emirate discussed the current situation of Afghanistan, insisted on the requirement of an Islamic government and finding a true solution to the problems\u2026predictions by some analysts are all baseless and hold no truth.\n\nThe Taliban spokesman\u2019s comments came after Reuters, citing local media reports, reported Sunday that U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad indicated that he hopes to strike a peace deal with Taliban jihadis by April 2019.\n\n\u201cTaliban leaders have not agreed to any deadline because we are winning on all fronts,\u201d an anonymous Taliban member told Reuters.\n\nWhile in Kabul to push for U.S.-backed reconciliation between Kabul and the Taliban, Khalilzad told reporters he hopes \u201ca peace deal is reached before April 20 next year,\u201d when Afghanistan is planning to hold a presidential election.\n\nKhalilzad, an Afghan national, said he remained \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the peace talks.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019 administration appointed the diplomat to hold direct talks with the Taliban.

He wrongly quoted us, saying that the Taliban admitted that militarily we would not succeed,\u201d a senior Taliban member in Afghanistan told Reuters.\n\nAnother anonymous senior Taliban member said Khalilzad\u2019s move to declare a deadline showed how desperate the U.S. was to withdraw foreign forces.\n\nEchoing President Trump\u2019s strategy to end the Afghanistan war, which was the American commander-in-chief unveiled last year, Khalilzad said Sunday that the end-state of the negotiations would be \u201cpeace and a successful Afghanistan, one that doesn\u2019t pose any threats to itself and to the international community\u201d.\n\nReuters noted:\n\nThe Taliban spokesman was not immediately available for comment but two senior Taliban leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Taliban leaders will present a new set of demands to Khalilzad. The insurgents, fighting to expel foreign forces and defeat the Western-backed Afghan government, last month presented demands to Khalilzad that included a timeline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the release of senior Taliban from jails.\n\nPakistan, which the U.S. has accused of backing the Taliban, released one of the group\u2019s co-founders and another high-ranking commander last month.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has intensified its peace-seeking efforts in recent months, the Taliban has continued to wreak havoc.\n\nDespite an unprecedented bombing campaign against Afghan jihadis under Trump\u2019s watch, terrorists, primarily the Taliban, control or contest about 45 percent of Afghanistan, according to the latest assessment by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR).\n\nThe 28,529 casualties sustained by the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) since former U.S. President Barack Obama declared the American combat mission over at the end of 2014 dwarf the 55 suffered by the United States troops over the same period, a testament to the Afghans commitment against terrorism.\n\nOn Saturday, U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman General Joseph Dunford contradicted Afghan President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s assertion that the Taliban is losing the war.\n\n\u201cWe used the term stalemate a year ago and relatively speaking it hasn\u2019t changed much, but \u2026 we do believe that the Taliban know that at some point they have to reconcile,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has made reconciliation between Kabul and the Taliban the primary goal of its Afghan strategy."}]
