President Trump weighed in on Twitter this week, \u201cthe inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with answers they want.\u201d They\u2019ve gone absolutely nuts? Have you seen any evidence of that? Do you know what the president\u2019s talking about?\n\nBLUNT: I don\u2019t know what the president\u2019s talking about but I do know that that\u2019s not news that the president would have this view of the Mueller investigation. He has engaged in this in that way from the very start, just like virtually every member of the Senate. And I think most members of the House have engaged, saying \u201cMr. President, it would be a huge mistake not to let the Mueller investigation come to a conclusion. We need to get beyond this, we don\u2019t need to start \u2013 have this starting again.\u201d\n\nRADDATZ: So you have confidence in the Mueller investigation?\n\nBLUNT: I do. I do.\n\nRADDATZ: And let\u2019s talk about the acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Lindsey Graham just said on another program this morning, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s the best choice. What do you think about that?\n\nBLUNT: Well, what we need is a permanent attorney general. We need to move as quickly as we can beyond whoever is the acting attorney general to an attorney general that\u2019s going to be there for, hopefully, a much longer period of time. So we\u2019ll see. I don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker well. I\u2019ve known him for some time, met him in Iowa years ago when he was U.S. Attorney. On the occasions I\u2019ve had with him to be \u2014 he\u2019s been very responsive and has seen that the Justice Department responded to the things I\u2019ve asked about. So in terms of an acting capacity, he does not \u2014 he seems to be a person that has the ability to do that acting job and \u2026\n\nRADDATZ: But not a permanent position; is that what you\u2019re saying?\n\nBLUNT: Well, I would think \u2014 I \u2014 I would think not. But that\u2019s \u2014 the president needs to determine who\u2019s going to be permanently at the Justice Department as soon as he can. Now, you know and I know that one of \u2026\n\nRADDATZ: What are you looking for?\n\nBLUNT: \u2026 one of our big challenges in this generally has been that our friends on the other side in the Senate have made it so hard to get anybody confirmed to anything. And so, you know, the president\u2019s unlikely, I think, to make that nomination before the Congress reconvenes and, if he did, we\u2019d be unlikely to be able to do anything with it. We are way beyond the time where you have a hearing and a week later somebody gets confirmed to these jobs, no matter how insignificant they are. And this one, of course, is very significant.\n\nRADDATZ: Just \u2014 just tell me what you\u2019re looking for in an attorney general, if not Matt Whitaker.\n\nBLUNT: Well, I think what the president should be looking for in an attorney general is someone who can manage the Justice Department, who understands the far-ranging impact of that Department, hopefully, has had some experience working with or in the Department before that, and \u2026\n\nRADDATZ: And as for the Mueller investigation?\n\nBLUNT: \u2026 As for the Mueller investigation, I \u2014 I think the Mueller investigation is going forward. I \u2026\n\nRADDATZ: In terms of an attorney general.\n\nBLUNT: \u2026 Well, in terms of an attorney general, you know, the \u2014 the big question here on the Mueller investigation, I think, is whether the Congress has any ability to tell the president who can work in the executive branch. That\u2019s a Constitutional question, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s different than the question of whether Mueller should be allowed to continue, it\u2019s what could you do about that. You know, this idea that we\u2019d have a debate, and have a vote and put a bill on the president\u2019s desk that he wouldn\u2019t sign. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s nearly as impactful as members continuing to say, Mr. President, we need to get beyond this; you need to let this come to a conclusion.

have turned the Franco-German couple into the heart of the United Europe to which other partners have gradually joined who had in the past been our allies or adversaries,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrance has always been on Germany\u2019s side,\u201d said the progressive president of the French Republic, explaining in the ambitious speech of his vision for the European Union that \u201cthe new Franco-German responsibility is to build a modern, effective, sovereign, democratic Europe,\u201d which seeks to \u201cregulate fair trade, protect the environment, and provide a good balance between individual freedom and collective solidarity.\u201d\n\nLaying out clearly his plan for a more federalised EU, a closer union, a United States of Europe, Mr Macron told the parliament: \u201cOf course it causes some anguish because we have to share decision making on policies, migration policies, development policies, and share our fiscal resources.\n\n\u201cWe must have common defence, turn the euro into an international currency with a budget, and create a European asylum office\u2026 all of this is in front of us.\u201d\n\nClaiming that Germany and France \u201cowe it to the world\u201d to develop into a European super-state, he warned that the world was \u201cchanging\u201d and \u201cat a crossroads,\u201d speaking with foreboding of a \u201cnationalism without any memory.\u201d\n\nIt was both in reference to a European defence force and criticisms of \u201cnationalism\u201d that Mr Macron was condemning U.S. President Donald Trump in all but name.\n\nTrump

called for an EU army to protect against China, Russia, \u201cand even the United States of America\u201d \u2014 raising questions as to whether his several references in Sunday\u2019s speech to \u201cpowers that want to eliminate us, attack our democracy\u201d referred to historic ally and NATO partner the United States, besides others.\n\nExpressing an anxiety that Europe \u201cplays only a second role on the world stage,\u201d Macron declared that \u201cThe Franco-German partnership has an obligation not to let the world fall into chaos and to lead Europe to peace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for this reason that Europe must be stronger, more sovereign, because it can only play its role in the world if it takes on more responsibility in the fields of defence.\u201d\n\nMacron Calls for

army in the European Union\u2019s Parliament, with Brussels bureaucrats expressing their \u201cdelight\u201d that Germany and France were leading the charge for a Europe without 27 national armies, but instead one controlled centrally by Brussels.\n\nDespite German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Mr Macron making a show of unity and European leadership Sunday, both politicians are severely weakened in their respective countries.\n\nA poll released Sunday shows that Macron has only 25 per cent of public support, the day after France saw nation-wide protest by more than a quarter of a million people protesting against massive fuel tax hikes \u2014 the largest coordinated civil action against Macron\u2019s policies to date.\n\nMeanwhile in Germany, after suffering in regional elections and her party having the worst election results in the Bundestag since 1949, Merkel has announced that she will step down as leader of the Christian Democratic Union, and after 13 years as Chancellor will not run in the next election \u2014 in 2021."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Bob Price", "title": "Feds Seek Prison Time for Previously Deported Child

By its coda, Jones describes the deaths of his \u201cloved\u201d ones: \u201cWe didn\u2019t commit suicide. We committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world.\u201d\n\nIn the four decades since the occurrence of the most bizarre event in American history, observers uniformly have seen the act Jones described as \u201crevolutionary\u201d as one of submission. The other half of the peculiar phrase\u2014taken from the title of Black Panther Huey Newton\u2019s 1973 book Revolutionary Suicide\u2014provokes a livelier debate.\n\nDid the 908 Peoples Temple members who died along with Jim Jones inside of Jonestown commit suicide? Or, did he murder them?\n\nThe 43-minute death tape recorded at Jonestown suggests the latter. What jars more than Jones\u2019s crazed plea to get \u201cthe vat, the vat, the vat\u201d or his scold of \u201cmother, mother, mother, mother, mother, please\u201d are the sounds the listener never hears.\n\nSave for Christine Miller, a 60-year-old African American who courageously and logically tries to argue Jones out of mass suicide, no adult says anything to stop the carnage. The crowd heckles Miller and at one point rushes her. Nobody seconds her.\n\nClearly, many did not want to die. Fifteen people left Jonestown with Congressman Leo Ryan and a smaller party of eleven fled earlier in the day under the guise of holding a picnic. But just four people out of more than 900 present when the killings started managed to escape or evade the suicide ritual (Jones allowed his lawyers, radical cause celebre attorneys Mark Lane and Charles Garry, and a trio tasked with bringing the Temple\u2019s money to the Soviet embassy to leave). Every other adult, except Miller, does not object on the tape to the group\u2019s assigned fate. And even Miller, who offers migration to the Soviet Union as an alternative to mass suicide, ultimately ceases her lengthy argument and yields to her master.\n\n\u201cI just want to say something to everyone that I see that is standing around and are crying,\u201d one communard announces on the death tape. \u201cThis is nothing to cry about. This is something we should all rejoice about.\u201d\n\nAnother woman exclaims, \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure walking with all of you in this revolutionary struggle. No other way I would rather go than to give my life for Socialism, Communism, and I thank Dad very, very much.\u201d\n\nThe few eyewitnesses to survive supported this characterization of Temple members willingly drinking grape Flavor-Aid laced with valium and cyanide.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t force nobody as far as my knowing,\u201d Grover Cleveland Davis, an elderly African American who hid in a ditch, noted at the time, \u201cand I didn\u2019t see him shooting nobody with no needles, and I didn\u2019t hear nobody say they wasn\u2019t willing to take suicide shots. They were willing to do it.\u201d\n\nBut archers and gunmen surrounded. The knowledge that Jones\u2019s Red Brigade shot Temple members who opted to leave with Congressman Leo Ryan on an airstrip outside of the community surely influenced matters. The dreadful conditions in the jungle\u2014overworked, underfed, deprived of sleep, and barraged by Jones\u2019s incessant propaganda\u2014surely altered decision making, such as it existed in Jonestown on an individual level.\n\nRather than an act of nihilism, Jones masked mass suicide as an act of idealism, a sacrifice for the higher purpose of giving glory to Communism\u2014a characterization that surely made the poison more potable to the hardened ideologues. And for three years prior to the carnage, Jones conditioned his followers through suicide dry runs that resulted in those initially informed of their imminent deaths surviving the acid tests. In Jonestown, the conditioning came in the form of \u201cwhite nights,\u201d staged sieges by invisible forces on the edges of the community.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s there,\u201d Mike Carter, who survived because Jones tasked him to take money to the Soviet embassy, explained to me of \u201cwhite nights\u201d in an interview for Cult City: Jim Jones, Harvey Milk, and 10 Days That Shook San Francisco. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ranting and raving and the world\u2019s coming to an end. There was definitely a lot of Jim going off on tangents. You just wanted it to end.\u201d\n\nOn November 18, 1978, many of the rank-and-file just wanted it to end.\n\nPerhaps the most persuasive voice for murder rather than suicide witnessed the events of Jonestown in microcosm a hundred miles away in Georgetown, Guyana. Thomas Beikman, after fixing a chicken dinner for Jones devotee Sharon Amos and her family, ceded the knife over to her after the meal. She proceeded to slash her children\u2019s throats in a nearby bathroom.\n\n\u201cI think she thought she was so muckety-muck that everybody would follow her example of what to do,\u201d Beikman told me in an interview for Cult City. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize until after it happened. But people didn\u2019t want to die out there. People didn\u2019t want to commit suicide. You can\u2019t shoot people, cut people, and inject people, and then say it\u2019s suicide. That\u2019s the biggest farce I ever heard.\u201d\n\nIn Georgetown, where Jones\u2019s charisma and the threat of gunmen lay far off, Peoples Temple members did not follow his command or Sharon Amos\u2019s example. The dozens of Temple members in Guyana\u2019s capital, save for the deranged Amos and her three kids, survived.\n\nSo, whether Jim Jones murdered his followers or they killed themselves voluntarily remains a debated question with strong arguments on both sides. But the \u201crevolutionary\u201d part of the peculiar phrase seems a settled matter.\n\n\u201cPeople in San Francisco will not, not be idle over this, and not take our death in vain,\u201d Jones insisted on the macabre recording.\n\nBut Mayor George Moscone, Supervisor Harvey Milk, Assemblyman Willie Brown, Congressman Phil Burton, and other power players who elevated Jones\u2019s stature in San Francisco ran from him in the aftermath of Jonestown. Everyone regarded the mass suicide as an act of surrender, not of revolt.\n\nDaniel J.

The consultation occurs because the brush, the vegetation is so dry, and the humidity is so low. And when you have that and then the heat and years of drought, that gets it going. In paradise, there were a lot of buildings that also caught fire, and it just went from one to the other. So it\u2019s a mixture of many things, and the president talked about how our forests are managed. That\u2019s an element. But there is also the way the houses were built, the materials, what kind of vegetation is around, and then there\u2019s also the changing climate and the increasing drought and the lowered humidity and water vapor. All of that is combining to create the tragic situation that we saw today in both northern California and here in southern California.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWhere paradise is, of course, is surrounded by federally managed land. These are national forests. They\u2019re not state parks, and they\u2019re not private property by Californians. So it is the federal government. And the fact is that managing the forest is part of it. They are a lot denser than they were 200 years ago, but on top of that, we have a five-year drought. We have reduced rainfall. We have the vegetation and bushes and houses and trees that turn into timber, so it\u2019s ready to explode. So there is an atmospheric element, which is part of the natural cycle, and then there is an increasing\n\nHe added, \u201cThe only way to assure the long-term forest health is not just, you know, cutting trees, it\u2019s going to require reducing carbon emissions and eventually, sooner rather than later to zero. If we don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re going to see these fires not only continuing but getting worse by the year as they are. The last five years, the fires have never been this bad. This fire in Malibu is the worst we\u2019ve ever seen. This fire in Paradise in Northern California is the worst in the history of California. So, yeah, you can mold the science, but I\u2019ll tell you, every year it\u2019s going to get clearer and clearer so that I think in less than five years even the worst skeptics are going to be believers.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Warner Todd Huston", "title": "Antifa Uses Flyers Mascot \u2018Gritty\u2019 to Protest Proud Boys in Philadelphia", "description": "Left-wingers have adopted Gritty, the mascot of the Philadelphia Flyers, and forced it into service as a symbol of Antifa.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2018/11/18/antifa-flyers-mascot-gritty-protest-proud-boys-philadelphia/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/AP-Tom-Mihalek.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T16:51:23Z", "content": "Gritty, the Flyers\u2019 googly-eyed, orange-furred team mascot, has become a staple at Antifa protests in Philadelphia, appearing on signs, hats, shirts, and fliers handed out by liberals who claim to oppose \u201cfascism.\u201d The mascot originally debuted for the Flyers\u2026 [+1800 chars]", "fulltext": "Left-wingers have adopted Gritty, the mascot of the Philadelphia Flyers, and forced it into service as a symbol of Antifa.\n\nGritty, the Flyers\u2019 googly-eyed, orange-furred team mascot, has become a staple at Antifa protests in Philadelphia, appearing on signs, hats, shirts, and fliers handed out by liberals who claim to oppose \u201cfascism.\u201d\n\nThe mascot originally debuted for the Flyers only a few months ago, and, while some did not like the orange monster at first, it wasn\u2019t long before the hardcore left glommed onto the creature as their own, taking him out of mere hockey mascottery and into the realm of anti-Trump, anti-Conservative politics.\n\nNot long after Gritty\u2019s debut ,the far left-wing magazine Jacobin celebrated Gritty as a \u201cworker\u201d starting the ball rolling for leftists to take Gritty as their own.

He ordered that he be held without bond until further hearings. Officials removed the wanted drug boss to the Cadereyta state prison. As Breitbart News first reported in an exclusive article, detectives with the Nuevo Leon\u2019s State Investigations Agency arrested Ramirez Bautista at a checkpoint after the wanted drug lord left a bar near the Barrio Antiguo neighborhood in Monterrey.\n\nPrior to his arrest, Ramirez Bautista allegedly attempted to run over a law enforcement official at the checkpoint and then resisted the arrest. During the arrest, authorities seized a.38o caliber handgun carried by the wanted drug lord.\n\nThe man known as La Mora is a key boss with a criminal organization that once belonged to the Beltran Leyva Cartel but has since branched off and become independent and highly dangerous. Under orders from his boss Rodolfo \u201cEl Gato\u201d Villarreal, Ramirez Bautista is believed to have played a role in helping mastermind the 2013 murder of Gulf Cartel attorney Juan Jesus Guerrero Chapa. As Breitbart News reported, Guerrero Chapa was gunned down in the ritzy Dallas suburb of Southlake after a long-term surveillance operation. The murder was personal in nature since Ramirez Bautista\u2019s boss El Gato blamed Guerrero Chapa for the murder of his father.\n\nRamirez Bautista is wanted by U.S. authorities in the ongoing case against Villarreal and federal authorities had added him to a most wanted list of fugitive cartel bosses in the Texas border region.\n\n\n\nThe ruling by the judge denying bond for Ramirez Bautista comes as a surprise since in recent months, as Breitbart News has reported, federal judges in Mexico have been releasing an alarming number of cartel bosses by ruling their arrests as illegal or alleging some other bureaucratic error. The man known as La Mora had been arrested in 2017. However, a Mexican federal judge ruled at the time that the raid that led to his capture was illegal and ordered his release.\n\nSoon after the most recent arrest, gunmen from El Gato\u2019s criminal organization murdered 34-year-old Santiago Aaron Urbina Arellano. This man managed Bar Ambria, where Ramirez Bautista visited prior to his arrest. It is believed that the gunmen targeted the bar manager suspecting that he may have tipped off law enforcement.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Pam Key", "title": "Stacey Abrams Refuses to Say Brian Kemp Is the Legitimate Governor of Georgia", "description": "Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Stacey Abrams refused to say the election of Brian Kemp was legitimate after he won the gubernatorial race in Georgia.

Do you think Arizona is winnable for a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020?\n\nFLAKE: It certainly is. Arizona is still nominally a Republican state. We have a voter registration advantage still of 200,000 statewide. But you cannot run as someone who is tied at the hip with the president and win statewide. Voters in Arizona are rejecting that. And I think we\u2019re seeing that elsewhere in the country as well. We\u2019re losing the suburbs. If we had a mass movement from the suburbs, for people to move back to rural areas then perhaps our Republican party would have more of a future but not the way that we\u2019re going now.

But the decision undermined the picture of the Trump administration the media have sought to portray, in three ways:\n\n1. A Trump appointee ruled against Trump. The media, and their Democratic Party allies, have treated President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees as if they can be expected to be slavishly loyal to the administration. That is why, for example, they focused on Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s views on whether a president can be indicted while in office. The left expects judges to vote their \u201cparty,\u201d because that is what left-wing judges do. Kelly, a Trump appointee, did not.\n\n2. Conservatism helped the media. Judge Kelly specifically said: \u201cI must apply precedent as I see it,\u201d even if he did not agree with it. Acosta won \u2014 thanks to the conservative judicial philosophy the president has prioritized in his appointees.\n\n3. The president accepted the decision. President Trump accepted the validity of the decision. He also ordered the White House to develop new rules for press behavior, in conformity with the ruling that Acosta\u2019s due process rights had been violated. Compared with Obama, who often tried to ignore court decisions he lost, Trump\u2019s approach was refreshing \u2014 and the opposite of the \u201cautocrat\u201d image the media have contrived.\n\nThe case has not yet been decided on the merits. Trump could prevail \u2014 or Acosta\u2019s suspension could turn out to be a political mistake.\n\nBut the system of checks and balances works better than ever \u2014 thanks, largely, to Trump.\n\nJoel B.

The organization will prioritize candidates who are women, represent the diversity of communities in their district, and support the major tenets of Justice Democrats platform: rejecting corporate PAC donations, Medicare For All, free college, dismantling mass incarceration and deportations, and a Green New Deal.\n\nOthers backing the campaign include Palestinian American Representative-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), whose views are so hostile to Israel that even the left-wing J Street organization withdrew its support for her campaign.\n\nJoel B.

The solid-colored dresses that the Slovenian-born former model often opts for in her day-to-day White House work can be easily repeated multiple times, as Mrs. Trump has illustrated this week.\n\nOn Friday, Mrs. Trump joined President Donald Trump in the East Room of the White House to present the Presidential Medal of Freedom to several heroic civilians. Mrs. Trump recycled a cobalt blue Roland Mouret sheath dress that features a thick silver zipper up the back.\n\nMrs. Trump first wore the number to a March 2016 Republican primary presidential debate in Detroit, Michigan. For that evening, Mrs. Trump paired the dress with a matching blue clutch and a dark navy coat.\n\nTwo and half years later, Mrs. Trump has brought the sheath dress back out, this time pairing it with no accessories and only her favorite Christian Louboutin slick black stilettos.\n\nAs Mrs. Trump walked out of the East Room, photographers got a glimpse of the stilettos\u2019 red soles and the silver zipper on the dress. You can\u2019t go wrong with a blue, silver, and red color combo.\n\nEarlier in the week, Mrs. Trump gave a speech at the annual Family Online Safety Institute in Washington, D.C. wearing a Ralph Lauren grey knit dress (Perfect for the freezing cold!).\n\nDays after her husband had won the 2016 presidential election, Mrs. Trump wore the Ralph Lauren knit dress to have lunch with her son, Barron, in New York City.\n\nFor the lunch date, Mrs. Trump was Manhattan chic, throwing a rich red jacket over her shoulders, donning a pair of black square sunglasses, carrying a matching red leather Chanel handbag, and black and white snakeskin Christian Louboutin stilettos. So New York!\n\nNearly two years later in Washington, D.C., Mrs. Trump has paired down the Ralph Lauren dress, keeping it simple with just some tan pointed stilettos by Christian Louboutin, a fresh face, and her signature smokey eye.\n\nAnd voila! It\u2019s a new dress!\n\nAnd it is not only dresses Mrs. Trump is re-purposing these days. In March Mrs. Trump strutted out of the White House in a navy coat with a funnel-like collar by French luxury brand Chlo\u00e9 and breathtakingly rich Gianvito Rossi knee-high Italian leather boots.\n\nThe boots tucked under a coat harks back to the styles of the 1980\u2019s that have been revitalized at all the major fashion houses \u2014 think of the recent collections from Celine, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, and Marc Jacobs.\n\nThough she has yet to re-wear the gorgeous, high-collared Chlo\u00e9 coat, Mrs. Trump stepped out to greet U.S. Marines in Washington, D.C. in a black and white flannel winter coat by Danish designer Malene Birger and, once again, the Gianvito Rossi tan leather boots.\n\nThis fashion adaption is merely about keeping the same silhouette, that 1980\u2019s vibe, but switching out something as simple as the color or pattern of the coat.

He said he would try to convince Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and his centrist Kulanu party to stay in the fold.\n\n\u201cIt would be both unnecessary and incorrect to go to elections. We remember well what happened when elements inside the coalitions took down Likud governments in 1992 and in 1999,\u201d he said, noting the past two elections in which the Labor Party came to power.\n\n\u201cWe need to do everything we can to prevent repeating these mistakes,\u201d he added.\n\nThe sudden coalition crisis was sparked by the resignation of Israel\u2019s hard-line Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who had demanded a far stronger response last week to the most massive wave of rocket attacks on Israel since the 2014 Israel-Hamas war. He alleges the truce will put southern Israel under a growing threat from Hamas, similar to that posed to northern Israel by Lebanon\u2019s heavily armed Hezbollah group.\n\nThe departure of Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu party leaves the coalition with a one-seat majority in the 120-member parliament. Netanyahu\u2019s other partners say that makes governing untenable and would leave the coalition susceptible to the extortion of any single lawmaker until elections scheduled for November 2019.\n\nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett, of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, has already threatened to bring down the government if he is not appointed defense minister. Kahlon says another year of such instability will harm the economy.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to convince them to stay, and his Likud allies are already preparing to pin the blame on them if that effort fails.\n\n\u201cI think that there is no reason to shorten the term of a national government, not even for one day, and at this moment it\u2019s in the hands of the education minister and the finance minister,\u201d said Gilad Erdan, the minister of public security.\n\nNo Israeli government has served out its full term since 1988. Since then, elections have almost always been moved up because of a coalition crisis or a strategic move by the prime minister to maximize his chances of re-election.\n\nThough Netanyahu has been reportedly flirting with the idea of moving up elections himself in recent months, the current timing is not ideal for him.\n\nHe has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the Gaza cease-fire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class, rocket-battered towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his Likud Party. But with Lieberman forcing his hand and the other coalition partners appearing eager to head to the polls he may not have a choice.\n\nMost opinion polls show Netanyahu easily securing re-election, which would secure him a place in Israeli history as the country\u2019s longest-serving leader. But several factors could trip him up, including a potential corruption indictment that could knock him out of contention.\n\nPolice have recommended he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases and have questioned him at length on another. The country has long been eagerly awaiting the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether to press charges.\n\nNetanyahu has angrily dismissed the accusations against him, characterizing them as part of a media-driven witch-hunt that is obsessed with removing him from office."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Chris Tomlinson", "title": "French MP Proposes Muslims Adopt French Names to Become Citizens, Extend Ban on Islamic Headscarves", "description": "French conservative Republican MP\u00a0Julien Aubert has put his name behind a series of migrant integration proposals that would include banning the Islamic headscarf in public institutions and make Muslims adopt French names to become citizens.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/11/18/french-mp-proposes-muslims-adopt-french-names-become-citizens-extend-ban-hijab/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/FRANCE-RELIGION-ISLAM.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T12:15:37Z", "content": "The proposals come from a new 50-page booklet entitled the \u201cTricolore Booklet on the Islam(s) of France,\u201d which lists 18 proposals in total, published by the Oser la France movement which was formed by Aubert last year, France3 reports.

The body, however, has faced criticism that governments have abused the \u201cred notice\u201d system to go after political enemies and dissidents, even though its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality and prohibits the use of police notices for political reasons.\n\nTwo years ago, Interpol introduced new measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice\u2019s compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out. Interpol also introduced an appeals body for those targeted with red notices.\n\nChinese authorities say Meng is being lawfully investigated for taking bribes and other crimes. China\u2019s beleaguered rights activists point out that as someone with a seat atop the country\u2019s powerful public security apparatus, Meng helped build the opaque system of largely unchecked power wielded by the ruling Communist Party to which he\u2019s now fallen victim.\n\nMeng\u2019s wife has told The Associated Press from France that the bribery accusation he faces is just an excuse for a lengthy detention and that he is being persecuted for political reasons.\n\nAs more than 1,000 delegates from 192 member-states began filling the main hall for the annual event, Interpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock explained to reporters that the agency\u2019s rules did not allow for Meng to continue acting as president. Meng had been serving as president since November 2016, and his term was due to end in 2020.\n\nHe said Interpol received Meng\u2019s resignation letter from China on Oct. 7 and that Interpol was notified by Chinese authorities that Meng is no longer a delegate to Interpol.\n\n\u201cIt sounds a little technical but again that automatically leads to the fact, according to our rules, that he is not the president anymore,\u201d Stock said. \u201cWe had to take the measures to ensure the functioning of the organization.\u201d\n\nMeng\u2019s representatives say Interpol accepted an unsigned resignation letter without any resistance and without evidence of his consent.\n\nIn Meng\u2019s place on Sunday, senior vice president of Interpol\u2019s executive committee, Kim Jong Yang of South Korea\u2014 who was previously named acting president \u2014 helped open the ceremony for the general assembly meeting.\n\nA little more than a week ago, Stock told reporters in France\u2014 where Interpol is headquartered\u2014 that there was no reason for him to suspect that anything about Meng\u2019s resignation \u201cwas forced or wrong.\u201d\n\nHe said he \u201cencouraged\u201d Chinese authorities to provide information about Meng\u2019s location and legal status but can do no more because the role of Interpol is \u201cnot to govern over member states.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Breitbart Jerusalem", "title": "Hamas Gaza Chief Threatens Tel Aviv Following Truce", "description": "Hamas\u2019s leader in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar on Friday warned Israel \u201cnot to test us again,\u201d saying the next rocket barrage from the territory would target Tel Aviv and other central cities with a potency that would \u201csurprise\u201d Israel.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2018/11/18/hamas-gaza-chief-threatens-tel-aviv-following-truce/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Yahya-Sinwar.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T09:47:54Z", "content": "He also warned that the next time Israeli soldiers entered the Strip, they would only return through a prisoner exchange for thousands of prisoners.

In the words of one now-former resident, the burnt-over town \u201clooked like Iraq.\u201d Or as a fire official said even more succinctly, Paradise, once home to 27,000 people, is now \u201cArmageddon.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump visited the devastated area on Saturday.\n\nOf course, the fire that engulfed Paradise is only one of many raging fires in California; as of November 17, the statewide death toll stood at 71\u2014and will undoubtedly go higher. And property damage is being measured in the many billions of dollars, maybe hundreds of billions.\n\nSo we can see: Californians have suffered a clear defeat\u2014a defeat at the hands of nature.\n\nWhoa, the reader might be saying. Defeat? Is that really the right word?\n\nAnd the answer: Sure, it\u2019s exactly the right word. If you had a house, and now you don\u2019t, you\u2019ve lost something. You\u2019ve suffered a defeat. And for those who were alive, and now are dead\u2014well, they\u2019ve lost even more. Defeated, all.\n\nMoreover, if we follow the principle of John Donne\u2019s famous 17th century devotional, No Man Is an Island, such losses of life are defeats, not just for Californians, but for all of us. As Donne put it, \u201cTherefore, send not to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.\u201d In other words, as human beings, we\u2019re all in this together, and we all must fear the power of nature\u2014earth, wind, water, and, of course, fire.\n\nSo that\u2019s why we build defenses against the elements, including walls, weatherproofing, and water sprinklers. And many of those defenses are best maintained at the civilizational level\u2014as buildings and developments with uniform fire codes, as roads that enable first responders to respond, as public works that store and move water, and as public exhortations about fire safety. As Donne might have put it, If we aren\u2019t looking out for each other, we aren\u2019t looking out for ourselves.\n\nSpeaking of the 17th century, it was another Briton of that era, Sir Francis Bacon, who put the upward path of civilization in proper perspective\u2014as a matter of ultimate victory for humanity. As he wrote, we\u2019re all in a long struggle against the random caprice of nature, and so that\u2019s why we need science and technology. Indeed, Bacon is remembered as the father of the Scientific Revolution\u2013that is, the organized search for solutions to human problems.\n\nAfter all, if we have the right science and technology for the situation at hand, we can win. And if we don\u2019t, we lose. So today, if we\u2019re not at risk from, say, polio, that\u2019s because a latter-day Baconian, Jonas Salk, invented the polio vaccine back in the 1950s, and because the political system, ever since, has arranged for the vaccine\u2019s widespread distribution. Indeed, we can apply this same point to all the inventions and innovations that have improved our personal prosperity, safety, and longevity\u2014a long list!\n\nIn fact, we need all of these gains, because, as the famed 20th century scientist Carl Sagan explained, \u201cExtinction is the rule: Survival is the exception.\u201d In other words, from the tiniest virus to the biggest asteroid, nature is always finding some way to kill us. It\u2019s not that nature is malevolent; it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a different system, not obviously oriented to our flourishing. So if we want to survive, we have to take affirmative steps to survive\u2014we have to defend ourselves. There\u2019s a phrase for this: Survival of the fittest. That is, for the sake of survival, we must adapt, and that means adapting our environment.\n\nTo be sure, not everyone agrees with Bacon\u2019s worldview. Most obviously, green environmentalists view scientific progress with an attitude ranging from skepticism, to suspicion, to outright hostility. The green have all their arguments, of course, and it\u2019s worth listening to them, but at the same time, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that in California today, we are seeing some of the results of their thinking.\n\nFor example, as Trump has argued, in their opposition to logging, the greens have allowed forests to become denser, and thus more vulnerable to the eventual killer fire.\n\nMoreover, the greens have steadily opposed water desalination on the seacoast that could provide water for firefighters.\n\nSo we can see, thanks in no small part to the legal and regulatory structure created by the greens, millions of ordinary people, not just in California, are virtually defenseless against wildfires.\n\nOf course, to the greens, human defenselessness is a feature, not a bug, because for half a century now, they have argued that we have too many people, doing too much damage to the environment. The greens laid out their argument in books such as The Population Bomb (1968) and The Limits to Growth (1972), and they\u2019ve stuck to those mantras ever since. For instance, John Holdren, an advocate of radical population reductions, was appointed in 2009 to be President Barack Obama\u2019s White House science adviser.\n\nAlas for the greens, real people have not always cooperated with the plans the greens made for them. For instance, in California, the population of the state has doubled since 1970, from 19.9 million to 39.8 million. (During that same half-century, the population of the U.S. has increased, too, from 205 million to 326 million.)\n\nWe can all figure out what happens when the population grows; people move to settle more land. Oh sure, the additional people could live in center cities, but most people prefer, if they can, to spread out a little\u2014and this is especially true if they have children. To most folks with families, the idea of a house with a yard is a good thing, not a bad thing. And yet those new homes and neighborhoods need protecting, too.\n\nThus the question: Do we wish to protect our population from the threats of nature, or not?\n\nOf course, we can and should have common-sense zoning and smart land-use rules\u2013as well as, of course, overall protection against environmental toxins and poisons\u2013and yet at the same time, we need an orientation toward making room for population growth.\n\nThat is, we should figure that if the population grows, people will need a place to live. And so, for instance, Paradise, CA, is worth protecting. Those 27,000 souls have rights, too, and a claim on the conscience of all of us. We can further ask: If they are left homeless and destitute, where will they go, and what will they cost?\n\nYet the emerging line, courtesy of the elite chattering class and the Main Stream Media, is that the problem of wildfires is insoluble. For instance, here\u2019s a headline in The Atlantic that reads, \u201cThe Simple Reason That Humans Can\u2019t Control Wildfires.\u201d The answer, according to the article, is that fire is \u201clike an ocean\u201d\u2014that is, too big to contain.\n\nYet in point of fact, the reality of the ocean is what points us to a solution\u2014if we want it. As this author wrote in response to last year\u2019s wildfires, we could be desalinating ocean water on a mass scale, and using that fresh water to easily put out these fires.\n\nYes, seawater desalination is expensive, as is building the necessary delivery infrastructure to places such as Paradise, but such expense must be weighed against the cost of paying for the flaming status quo. That is, if last year\u2019s fires cost $180 billion\u2013and this year\u2019s fires might cost even more\u2013then we can see that even large expenditures on water desalination are still cheaper than fiery devastation. (Breitbart News\u2019s Joel Pollak has written extensively about California water issues, as part of an ongoing series.)\n\nNeedless to say, a plan for actually putting out fires will face opposition. Perhaps most obviously, any effective plan for extinguishing fires will encourage growth in rural areas. And the greens, thinking about, say, the Spotted Owl and the Delta Smelt, don\u2019t want that. As we know, in recent decades, the greens have won a lot more legal and regulatory battles than they\u2019ve lost\u2014and their victories are a big reason why Paradise is no longer a paradise.\n\nMoreover, the greens will think that if we develop a plan for putting out fires, we will be undercutting their core argument\u2014that the only acceptable solution to the problem of wildfires is to \u201ctake action\u201d against climate change. Yes, to many, that will seem like a strange argument, saying that we must make the perfect the enemy of the good. That is, we can\u2019t do anything about wildfires in California until we do something about climate change worldwide. Do we really want to wait that long? And do we really think we can pull that off? Or is talking about climate change in the future just an excuse for crimping the population in the here and now?\n\nSuch a green do-nothing stance might strike many as hypocritical because, after all, we\u2019ve been preventing, and putting out, fires in urban and suburban areas for a long time. So why now should we hold rural\u2014and now, on some occasions, suburban\u2014America hostage to the hopes for radical decarbonization through some some globo-mechanism, such as the Paris Climate Framework?\n\nYes, it\u2019s a bit odd to think that if we can\u2019t solve the problem of protecting a little place such Paradise, that we can then somehow go ahead and save the whole wide world. (It wouldn\u2019t be the first time, of course, that the elites were more interested in saving the world than in helping those closer.)\n\nIndeed, as we dig into the arguments against doing anything about fires, we see the full depths of the opposition to actually stopping fires; the opponents would rather deliver a larger critique of civilization itself. For instance, here\u2019s a recent headline from Bloomberg News: \u201cDon\u2019t Think It Will Be Easy to Fireproof California.\u201d The piece quotes one \u201cexpert\u201d as saying, \u201cThe idea of defensible space strikes me as an intrinsically Western one.\u201d That is, Western Civilization = Bad. (Admit it: You knew that the MSM would get there soon enough.)\n\nWell, actually, here\u2019s some news: Defensible space is a global concept, embraced by peoples around the world. The ancient Babylonians and Egyptians put up walls around their cities, as did the Chinese and the Incas. Indeed, it\u2019s deadly obvious that human beings anywhere won\u2019t last long if they don\u2019t have some sort of shelter, which soon enough becomes \u201cdefensible space.\u201d\n\nMoreover, all these civilizations chose to dig out irrigation channels and build berms to you guessed it\u2014move fresh water around and keep it \u201cdefensible.\u201d\n\nSo we\u2019re back to the ultimate question: Do we want people to win, or not?\n\nRight now, in California, they\u2019re losing.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a political dimension here, too. In 2018, the California Republican Party has been defeated, badly, yet again. So perhaps Republicans will see the value in trying something different. Perhaps Golden State GOPers will embrace a bold agenda of water desalination and infrastructure building, so that Californians can spread out from crowded cities, in which the Democrats have them penned, and live independent and free on homesteads. Such a vision\u2013extending the American Dream to all\u2013would be the sort of tonic that the GOP needs. Let the elite Democrats own, as they seem to want to, the idea of green limits and pessimism. Instead, Republicans will take ownership of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nA strong pro-homesteading policy built the Republican Party in the Midwest in the 19th century. It could do the same for the Republican Party in California (and other Western States, too) in the 21st century.\n\nThe enduring lesson: Putting people first is popular."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Aaron Klein", "title": "Broward\u2019s Brenda Snipes Searches Her Office for Over 2,000 \u2018Missing\u2019 Ballots", "description": "LAUDERHILL, Fla. -- Embattled Broward Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes is personally overseeing the search within her headquarters here for purportedly missing ballots to account for the 2,040-vote discrepancy in the number of votes cast in her county durin\u2026", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/17/browards-brenda-snipes-searches-her-office-for-over-2000-missing-ballots/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/AP_18318138716167.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T01:10:59Z", "content": "The discrepancy came in the difference of total votes registered from the initial machine count and the results from the machine recount numbers reported earlier today.

The workers spoke on condition that their names be withheld.\n\nSnipes herself earlier told the elections Canvassing Board as well as lawyers for the Democratic and Republican parties that the purportedly missing ballots are \u201cin the building\u201d and have not disappeared.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to determine what could have caused the drop. What we believe is that in the recount area \u2026 I believe those ballots were probably mixed in with another stack. The ballots are in the building. The ballots are in the building,\u201d Snipes said earlier today.\n\n\u201cThe ballots are in this building. There would be nowhere else for them to be. But they are misfiled in this building,\u201d she said.\n\nSeveral hours later Snipes said that her team still has not found the ballots: \u201cI really wanted to go on the record that the votes are in the building. I know that sounds trite. It sounds foolish,\u201d Snipes said.\n\nAs of this writing, the ballot discrepancy has not been accounted for. This reporter was embedded inside Snipes\u2019 headquarters for a portion of the evening.\n\nThe issue will soon be turned over to the elections Canvassing Board for a decision on how to proceed given a Sunday deadline for sending the final results to the state.\n\nIf Snipes cannot come up with physical ballots, the discrepancy could potentially be utilized by lawyers to argue for the Broward County machine results to be contested. It also throws into question whether the state should use the original count numbers or those of the recount.\n\n\u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d E. John Sebes, founder of Open Source Election Technology, a nonprofit organization promoting accuracy in the ballot-counting process, told the New York Times. \u201cIf you have an election margin of 0.21 percent and a variance of 0.12 percent, the variance of your machine count is half the margin you are trying to correct. That\u2019s kooky.\u201d\n\nThe discrepancy marks the latest controversy to hit Snipes\u2019 office regarding her handling of the Midterm election.\n\nLast weekend, the Miami Herald reported that Snipes\u2019 office mixed 20 rejected ballots with a sampling of 205 valid provisional ones in the current election. The discrepancy was reportedly found only after uproar from the Republican Party resulted in the Broward County canvassing board inspecting those provisional ballots.\n\nAnother issue has been the increase of 80,000 votes in Broward County following the election.\n\nThe New York Times reported on the issue:\n\nThe vote count in heavily Democratic Broward County increased by about 80,000 in the four days after the election, possibly because of mail-in, provisional, overseas and military ballots that come in late and were legally counted after Election Day. But no other counties showed were identified publicly with such a high number of additional ballots registered after the election, and Broward County\u2019s election supervisor, Brenda C. Snipes, offered few explanations. Noteworthy to outside election experts were the variances in vote tallies, which effectively meant that thousands of votes weren\u2019t counted. \u201cIf I were a campaign, I\u2019d be yelling and screaming,\u201d said Charles Stewart III, director of the Election Data and Science Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cI\u2019d want a hand recount of every single ballot.\u201d\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott, whose senate election is up for recount, called on Florida\u2019s Department of Law Enforcement to investigate possible irregularities in ballot offices in southern Florida amid questions about the slow pace of Broward\u2019s ballot counting and past wrongdoings by Snipes.\n\nA judge ruled that Snipes destroyed ballots too soon in a critical 2016 Congressional race in which former Democratic National Convention (DNC) Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz won reelection.\n\nSnipes was also ordered by a judge earlier this year to change the way she handles mail-in ballots after her office was accused of opening them in secret.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

It is widespread on cable news today and has been a staple of tabloids for more than a century. At scale it can undermine the quality of public discourse and lead to polarization. In our case, it can also degrade the quality of our services,\u201d Zuckerberg continued. \u201cOur research suggests that no matter where we draw the lines for what is allowed, as a piece of content gets close to that line, people will engage with it more on average \u2014 even when they tell us afterwards they don\u2019t like the content.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg then added that it \u201cis a basic incentive problem that we can address by penalizing borderline content so it gets less distribution and engagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy making the distribution curve look like the graph below where distribution declines as content gets more sensational, people are disincentivized from creating provocative content that is as close to the line as possible,\u201d the Facebook CEO explained. \u201cThis process for adjusting this curve is similar to what I described above for proactively identifying harmful content, but is now focused on identifying borderline content instead. We train AI systems to detect borderline content so we can distribute that content less.\u201d\n\nThe category we\u2019re most focused on is click-bait and misinformation. People consistently tell us these types of content make our services worse \u2014 even though they engage with them. As I mentioned above, the most effective way to stop the spread of misinformation is to remove the fake accounts that generate it. The next most effective strategy is reducing its distribution and virality. (I wrote about these approaches in more detail in my note on Preparing for Elections.) Interestingly, our research has found that this natural pattern of borderline content getting more engagement applies not only to news but to almost every category of content. For example, photos close to the line of nudity, like with revealing clothing or sexually suggestive positions, got more engagement on average before we changed the distribution curve to discourage this. The same goes for posts that don\u2019t come within our definition of hate speech but are still offensive. This pattern may apply to the groups people join and pages they follow as well. This is especially important to address because while social networks in general expose people to more diverse views, and while groups in general encourage inclusion and acceptance, divisive groups and pages can still fuel polarization. To manage this, we need to apply these distribution changes not only to feed ranking but to all of our recommendation systems for things you should join. One common reaction is that rather than reducing distribution, we should simply move the line defining what is acceptable. In some cases this is worth considering, but it\u2019s important to remember that won\u2019t address the underlying incentive problem, which is often the bigger issue. This engagement pattern seems to exist no matter where we draw the lines, so we need to change this incentive and not just remove content. I believe these efforts on the underlying incentives in our systems are some of the most important work we\u2019re doing across the company. We\u2019ve made significant progress in the last year, but we still have a lot of work ahead. By fixing this incentive problem in our services, we believe it\u2019ll create a virtuous cycle: by reducing sensationalism of all forms, we\u2019ll create a healthier, less polarized discourse where more people feel safe participating.\n\nZuckerberg also admitted that around one in ten removals on the platform are a mistake.\n\n\u201cToday, depending on the type of content, our review teams make the wrong call in more than 1 out of every 10 cases,\u201d Zuckerberg claimed. \u201cReducing these errors is one of our most important priorities\u2026 It\u2019s important to remember though that given the size of our community, even if we were able to reduce errors to 1 in 100, that would still be a very large number of mistakes.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Kyle Morris", "title": "Texas Representative Brian Babin: \u2018We Cannot Continue to Have Open Borders\u2019", "description": "Texas Republican Rep.

Brian Babin (R-TX) joined Breitbart News Saturday to discuss an array of issues including the dangers of socialism and his resolution to end birthright citizenship, which is one of President Trump\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cI introduced this resolution calling on the president to resume the interpretation of section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution as it was originally intended, and applied as law for a century, and end this birthright citizenship misinterpretation,\u201d Babin stated.\n\n\u201cThere was never an intention to grant citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. It was simply to grant citizenship to the children of former slaves at the end of the Civil War,\u201d Babin explained to Breitbart Washington Political Editor Matt Boyle. \u201cIt was only in the 1960s where it was starting to get this kind of skewed interpretation that it pertained to anyone who stepped foot in our country, legal or illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply not the case. It\u2019s never been tried in court. It\u2019s never been interpreted by the Supreme Court, and I think the president is doing the right thing. This 14th Amendment misinterpretation drives illegal immigration. Absolutely drives this. It\u2019s a magnet for people to try to sneak into the country, have an anchor baby, and then we wind up with families of illegal immigrants becoming citizens and residents of the United States,\u201d Babin added.\n\nListen to Brian Babin on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125:\n\nBabin also spoke on the legality of President Trump ending birthright citizenship with an executive order.\n\n\u201cThe jurisdictional principle is well understood. It\u2019s properly applied in some cases because you know, and I think everyone listening knows, that children born in the United States to foreign ambassadors and consulates, who reside here and are under a certain jurisdiction of foreign governments, are not granted American citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe amendment text in the 14th Amendment includes a residency requirement and surely no illegal alien can legitimately claim legal residency in or be under the legal jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d Babin argued. \u201cNo nation, including the United States, is under any moral obligation, whatsoever, to grant citizenship to people who have come into this country illegally and are subject to a foreign jurisdiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thirty nations with a policy of birthright citizenship, that have this, only two, Canada and the United States, are categorized as first world countries. These are third world countries that have birthright citizenship provisions.\u201d Babin said. \u201cWe cannot continue to have open borders, a magnet to bring more illegals in here and that\u2019s exactly what birthright citizenship interpretation of the 14th Amendment is doing.\u201d\n\nIn concluding the interview, Babin discussed the \u201coutright socialists\u201d that have found their way into the United States Congress.\n\n\u201cThis is another problem that they\u2019re going to have inside the Democratic party because you\u2019ve got outright socialists,\u201d Babin claimed. \u201cThey are all progressives, let\u2019s put it like that, but this outright socialism is a terrible danger to our economy, to our nation, and the future of our kids and grandkids.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocialism does not work. It will destroy our healthcare industry. We will have waiting lines. We will have people dying before they get to see the doctor. They will put off surgeries and not be able to get them because there will be healthcare rationing,\u201d Babin added.\n\n\u201cThank goodness we\u2019ve still got the Senate, so none of this nonsense can get through there. And we\u2019ve got the White House, a president who loves America and wants to see the best happen for the working folks of America,\u201d Babin said.\n\nFollow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris."}]
