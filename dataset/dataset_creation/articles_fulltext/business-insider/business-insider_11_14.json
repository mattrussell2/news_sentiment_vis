Some have even offered up their homes over Twitter.\n\nVenture capitalists, like Redpoint Ventures' Ryan Sarver (formerly Director of Platform at Twitter) and ENIAC Ventures' Nihal Mehta, have offered homes that they own in the area to those displaced by the fire.\n\nAirbnb has opened up doors at scale\n\nAirbnb has been able to do something similar at a much larger scale.\n\nThe company's Open Homes Program, which was created back in 2012 to assist with relief from Hurricane Sandy, allows hosts to offer up their homes to those displaced by the fires.\n\nAirbnb told Business Insider that so far over 2,000 hosts on its platform have offered their homes to evacuees of the Camp Fire and Woolsey's Fires. To date, nearly 1,000 evacuees and relief workers have been housed.\n\nKellie Bentz, Airbnb's Head of Global Disaster Response and Relief, told us over the phone on Wednesday: \"It's always terrible, but also good for us when it's close to home because it allows us to get a lot closer to the situation. In this case, we've been able to do that pretty quickly.\"\n\nThis week, the company improved its mobile sign up process for evacuees and is planning on opening up a hotline by Thursday for those in need of shelter.\n\n\"We're just trying to make it as easy as possible to book,\" Bentz explained.\n\nBentz said she helped one woman book a home on Tuesday who needed to flee her Southern California home with her friend and three dogs.\n\n\"They were literally on the side of the road,\" Benz explains. \"The hard part about wildfires is, we call them 'no notice events.' Typically, it's so fast moving. It's hard to be as prepared as a hurricane where at least you have a few hours to pack up. With [the wildfires], people literally just got what they could and ran out.\"\n\nFacebook, Google, Apple have also responded\n\nFacebook is helping as well.\n\nThe Menlo Park-based company committed to matching up to $500,000 in donations made on Facebook to American Red Cross' California wildfire relief efforts. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed with Business Insider that the match was met as of Tuesday, and in total, including the company's matching contribution, the Facebook community has raised more than $1.7 million for the American Red Cross.\n\nAlso, through Facebook Fundraisers \u2014 which the company announced on Wednesday had helped raise over $1 billion\u2014 users have been able to set up campaigns to help those who have lost their homes and valuables.\n\nOne user, whose brother and 97-year-old grandma both lost their homes in Paradise, California, has helped her family raise over $11,500 over Facebook. Another, who lives in Southern California, has helped raise over $7,500 to provide extra supplies, like water bottles and snacks, for firefighters and victims.\n\nThe Google-owned mapping service Waze, is doing its part in helping where it can. Waze tweeted last week that it is working \"around-the-clock\" to make sure maps were updated with road closures, as well as shelter information.\n\nGoogle.org has also committed $500,000 in grants to organizations helping those displaced by the fires.\n\nApple has announced, via a tweet from CEO Tim Cook, that it would be donating to fire relief efforts as well."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": null, "title": "Frigid planet detected orbiting nearby star - Business Insider", "description": "Business Insider Frigid planet detected orbiting nearby star Business Insider WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A frozen and dimly lit planet, dubbed a \"Super-Earth,\" may be orbiting the closest single star to our solar system, astronomers said on Wednesday, based on tw\u2026", "url": "http://uk.businessinsider.com/r-frigid-planet-detected-orbiting-nearby-star-2018-11", "urlToImage": "http://static3.uk.businessinsider.com/image/5becb3fedde867146c26c4e6-1190-625/frigid-planet-detected-orbiting-nearby-star.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T23:41:00Z", "content": "Handout photo of an artistic impression of a sunset from Barnard's star on the newly detected planet designated Barnard's Star b Thomson Reuters WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A frozen and dimly lit planet, dubbed a \"Super-Earth,\" may be orbiting the closest single s\u2026 [+2053 chars]", "fulltext": "Handout photo of an artistic impression of a sunset from Barnard's star on the newly detected planet designated Barnard's Star b Thomson Reuters WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A frozen and dimly lit planet, dubbed a \"Super-Earth,\" may be orbiting the closest single star to our solar system, astronomers said on Wednesday, based on two decades of scientific observations.\n\nThe planet, estimated to be at least 3.2 times more massive than Earth, was spotted circling Barnard's Star, a type of relatively cool and low-mass star called a red dwarf, about 6 light-years away from our solar system, comparatively close in cosmic terms. It is believed to orbit Barnard's Star every 233 days.\n\nPlanets orbiting stars beyond our solar system are called exoplanets. Nearly 4,000 have been discovered. The newly discovered one is the second closest to our solar system ever found. It is thought to be a \"Super-Earth,\" a category of planets more massive than Earth but smaller than the large gas planets.\n\n\"After a very careful analysis, we are 99 percent confident that the planet is there,\" researcher Ignasi Ribas of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia and the Institute of Space Sciences said in a statement. \"However, we'll continue to observe this fast-moving star to exclude possible, but improbable, natural variations of the stellar brightness which could masquerade as a planet.\"\n\nThe only closer stars than Barnard's Star are part of the triple-star system Alpha Centauri, located a bit more than 4 light-years from our solar system. Two years ago, astronomers announced the discovery of a roughly Earth-sized planet circling Proxima Centauri, part of the Alpha Centauri system, in an orbit that might enable liquid water to exist on its surface, raising the possibility that it could harbor alien life.\n\nThe newly detected planet orbiting Barnard's Star may not be so hospitable, with surface temperatures of perhaps minus 274 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 170 degrees Celsius). Barnard's Star provides the frigid planet only 2 percent of the energy that the sun provides Earth.\n\nThe researchers studied the planet by combining measurements from several high-precision instruments mounted on telescopes around the world.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature.\n\n(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler)"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Meredith Cash", "title": "The Saints won't be able to wear their home jerseys against the Eagles because of a golf bet between their head coaches", "description": "The New Orleans Saints will host the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome for their Week 11 matchup Sunday, but t he two teams will not be sporting their typical home and away jerseys.

While many teammates agreed that Green went too far, according to The Athletic's Marcus Thompson, some felt Green's criticisms of Durant weren't off-base.\n\n\"Durant's free agency has been a low-key issue with the players. It registered as a small irritation. The burden of talking about it, reading about it, hearing about it, grew heavier in Year 3 of the Durant Experience...\n\n\"According to several in the locker room, Durant could have ended this by just saying how much he loves playing with the Warriors and his teammates and leave it at that, even if he departs in the offseason. They are all prepared for him to leave so they just want the cloud hanging over them to go away. Another option would be to reject all questions about free agency and force the media to focus on this season, a way of protecting his teammates.\n\n\"Durant has said he doesn't want to lead anybody on. But Green is part of a contingent that believes Durant has a hand in creating the hype about his free agency, a tangential focus that detracts from their mission of winning a third straight title.\"\n\nSince joining the Warriors, Durant has taken two \"1+1\" contracts \u2014 one year, then a second-year player option. This is the same type of deal LeBron James took with the Cleveland Cavaliers in his second stint. For him, the deals served two purposes:\n\n1. To maximize his earnings. When a player joins a new team, it takes three years before that team has that player's full \"Bird rights.\" At that point, they can re-sign him to a longer, pricier deal than anyone else in the NBA.\n\n2. To apply pressure to the Cavs. With the threat of James leaving each season, the Cavs had to be perpetually in \"win now\" mode and making moves to maximize their chances.\n\nDurant is doing the same thing, and he's part of a tiny set of NBA players who could afford to do it. If possible, players like to lock in long contracts for the security that comes with them. James and Durant are some of the only players who could play on one-year deals and know that teams would still sign them to max contracts, even in the event of a significant injury.\n\nCuriously, though, Durant hasn't been maximizing his earnings as James has. He took less money last offseason to help the team re-sign players like Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston. If Durant had taken his full max, the Warriors wouldn't have had the money to re-sign them.\n\nRead more:Kevin Durant gave up $10 million for the upcoming season, and it could quietly be the most consequential move of the NBA offseason\n\nInstead, Durant's contracts seem to be about keeping his flexibility. Even while helping the Warriors win two titles, winning Finals MVP both times, and finding the higher level of basketball and culture that he craved, Durant has left his future open. There's a sense in the NBA world that the Warriors are still Stephen Curry's team, even with the added boost of dominance that Durant has brought along.\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty There have been hints of uneasiness about the relationship with Durant since he arrived. It took Curry two seasons to learn how to play with Durant (before his recent groin injury, he had figured it out in dominant fashion this year). Last year, Steve Kerr told ESPN's Zach Lowe that he had a crucial, sit-down talk with Durant during the middle of the season because he felt Durant \"drifting.\"\n\nAfter winning the championship, Warriors GM Bob Myers publicly ribbed Durant, saying that Durant couldn't have any contract he wants, adding that only Curry could. Some felt it was an awkward moment.\n\nRead more:The Warriors baffled the NBA world with several awkward comments about Kevin Durant's next contract\n\nAnd now, as Thompson and others have reported, as Durant heads into free agency this summer, the questions about where he may go are hovering above the team.\n\nThough James invited the speculation with the Cavs with his contract structure, last season, on the verge of free agency (the first when people thought he might indeed leave), James shut down all talk until the end of the season. As Thompson noted, Durant has not done that, and it's rubbing some teammates the wrong way.\n\nMost expect that Green and Durant will patch things up and the season will go on. The Warriors are talented enough to survive a rift, even if there are lingering hurt feelings. But as the season goes on, even if Durant were to shut down questions about his future, his free agency will still be approaching, and speculation will continue."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Remi Rosmarin", "title": "23 festive and fun Christmas decorations under $25", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

It's crucial to consider where the warehouse sits in the larger transportation network, like if it's accessible by seaport, multiple highway routes, railways, cargo airlines, and so on.\n\nTake the 80-acre Amazon warehouse that's opening next year in Tucson, Arizona. Marcotte said Tucson is \"ideal\" for such a warehouse, which will employ 1,500 people, because it's on a variety of rail junctions. Freight there can be easily moved between trucks and trains.\n\nRead more: Peeing in trash cans, constant surveillance, and asthma attacks on the job: Amazon workers tell us their warehouse horror stories\n\nCould such a mega-warehouse open in Nashville? \"It would not quite fit my absolute ideal, but it's pretty good,\" Marcotte said.\n\nBryan Ball, supply chain management research director for market intelligence firm Aberdeen, added that it would be \"a bit unusual.\"\n\nOn the plus side, Nashville is close to the seaports in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. (However, these seaports are relatively small.) It's also within a day's drive of major metropolises like Miami, Dallas, New York City, and Washington D.C.\n\nPlenty of companies have distribution centers in the area, Ball said. Amazon alone has four in or around Nashville, according to supply chain consultancy MWPVL International.\n\nAn Amazon fulfillment center. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images\n\nStill, the convergence of highways and railways in the city isn't quite as appealing as, say, Charlotte, North Carolina, Reno, Nevada, or the area between Oklahoma and Texas, Ball said. Louisville, Kentucky would also be an ideal choice, Davis-Sramek said.\n\nExperts kept pointing to a city about 200 miles west of Nashville as an ideal place for an Amazon mega-warehouse: Memphis, Tennessee. That's the city of the largest cargo airport in North America, with 11,000 FedEx employees alone.\n\nBut Nashville wins out for white collar over Memphis or other typical freight cities because, well, it's cooler.\n\n\"If I'm recruiting from outside of the region, Nashville has somewhat more of a cach\u00e9,\" Marcotte said. \"That's just how it's perceived.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kevin Webb", "title": "An Arizona couple will have to pay Nintendo over $12 million for running websites that offered free downloads of classic video games", "description": "Nintendo of America was recently awarded a $12.23 million dollar judgement in federal court against a married Arizona couple accused of copyright infringement.

The test uses 200,000 genetic markers and 100 times more genetic information than its competitors. It checks for over 250 different breed types and 175 genetic health conditions and traits \u2014 and it has partnered with Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine (the leading veterinary school in the country) and a pioneer in consumer genetics \u2014 Spencer Wells \u2014 to combine cutting-edge science and pet care. They're the people who are ecstatic to tell you they recently discovered why some dogs have blue eyes.\n\nKnowing your dog's genetic history is great for the shallow interest of curiosity and dog park small talk, but it can also help you navigate potential health risks, avoid medications they could be sensitive too, and even help you decide how big of a home you're going to need in the future.\n\nHere's how the dog DNA test works:Order the test online, activate it, swab the cheek of your dog, and mail the sample back to the Embark lab in a pre-paid return envelope. In two to four weeks, you'll receive the results. If you're unsure how to swab your dog's cheek correctly, there are video tutorials on the site.\n\nI tried the Embark dog DNA test on our rescue dog, Nellie, to see how it worked in real life. If you keep scrolling down to the bottom of this article, you can see the exact steps we went through in greater detail. But what I liked best was how digestible the information was for non-scientists, and how many resources were provided if you'd like to do further research. I also loved how obviously passionate about dogs the Embark team seemed to be.\n\nNellie, the dog whose results you'll see below, is the furthest dog on the left. Instagram\n\nOn the site, you can engage as little or as much as you want. It was as succinct as \"she's mostly a German Shepherd\" and \"she's clear of all the health risks we check for\" and as granular as links to learn how the process is done and breakdowns of what each genetic condition is as well as which breeds it's commonly found in. There are even linked citations in some sections where research was referred to.\n\nThe Embark dog DNA test is not cheap at $199, but it's information that could improve or extend the life of your dog \u2014 and for most owners, that's not a bad price to pay. Plus, with the holiday discount code \"HOLIDNA\" you can save yourself $40 now through December 31.\n\nAll in all, it's a great tool \u2014 and something most dog owners will probably be excited to learn about. Pets are the slobbery, warm-bodied, loving beings that occasionally care more for you than they do for themselves. Figuring out a bit more about how to responsibly return that love and care is an exciting new opportunity.\n\nIf you have multiple dogs and get tests for them, you can \"add a dog\" to your \"my dogs\" section in your account to keep your family all in one place. If you're going to test multiple, though, you should buy them in a pack to save money. Use the code \"MULTIPACK2\" for 10% off two; \"MULTIPACK3\" for 15% off three; and \"MULTIPACK4\" for 20% off four or more kits.\n\nGet the Embark dog DNA test for your pup here ($159 with the code \"HOLIDNA\") or scroll to see our experience and our dog's results below."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Rob Price", "title": "Sheryl Sandberg and other Facebook execs reportedly investigated if they could ban Trump after Zuck was \u2018appalled\u2019 by his call for a Muslim ban (FB)", "description": "In 2015, Facebook executives investigated whether Donald Trump's call for a ban on Muslim immigration broke the company's rules, according to a bombshell new report from the New York Times.

Parallel parking is just one part of the two-week training that New York City firefighters go through. The end result? They get certified to drive 42-foot-long fire trucks. The training includes lectures, written tests, a virtual driving simulator, and, just as you might expect, an obstacle course.\n\nFrom the first day, firefighters are behind the wheel, but they aren't ready to drive on city streets yet. They practice just like you might in Driver's Ed, at a parking lot. The first challenge is pretty straightforward. Drive in a straight line between two lines of cones. Then, back up the way you came. After that, it gets trickier. Weave in and out of cones without knocking any of them over and then, do that backwards.\n\nMike Jackson: One of the specific things we work on on the EVOC course is when we're maneuvering through the barrels, is we're lining up, let's say, our rear wheel tire. When that rear wheel tire is lined up against one of the barrels, then we can make our turn and we will not hit that barrel. So even though it seems a little simplistic maybe, but it represents, it could be a car out there. It could be the corner we're trying to get into.\n\nNarrator: Once they've gotten that down next up is parallel parking. Which, after the backwards cone weaving, doesn't look too bad. In fact, they use a similar technique to backing through the obstacle course. They line up the back tire with the car they're trying to park behind. After drivers master the parking lot, it's time to hit the streets. Well, sort of. They practice driving on Randall's Island, located right in between Manhattan and Brooklyn. That's where the Fire Department Training Academy is. In some ways, learning to drive a fire truck is like learning to drive any large vehicle but with one major difference.\n\nJackson: A big difference between driving our fire trucks as opposed to driving a large vehicle like a bus or a sanitation truck, is that we're responding to emergencies. There's an added stress on the time to get there and everyone handles that differently. We try to prepare the students to be ready for those emergencies.\n\nNarrator: But you can't do a test run in the middle of the city. So instead, one way firefighters prepare for this is by practicing in a simulator. Trainers can program the simulator to mimic different hazards. They can increase the number of cars on the road, make them drive fast or slow, and add things like roadblocks and pedestrians. But not every firefighter learns to chase down fires in the same truck. In fact, from the very start firefighters are divided into companies: the engine company and the ladder company. And this determines which type of truck each firefighter will drive.\n\nTurns out, the term fire truck isn't a catchall. There are two main types of fire trucks in New York City. The fire truck is the one with a ladder on it and a fire engine is the one used to pump water. Fire truck. Fire engine. The ladder truck is 42 feet long and the engine truck is 30 feet long. So maneuvering either one down narrow city streets requires careful driving skills. But a driver's job doesn't end when they arrive at the fire. Once there, the driver of the engine leads the charge for getting water onto the fire. The driver attaches the hose to the fire hydrant to fill the pump in the truck and then, does calculations to make sure there's enough pressure in the hose line to spray out a strong stream of water. At the same time, the driver of a ladder truck raises and positions the ladder or bucket to reach high stories of the building. And if anyone is trapped in the front of the building, they help get those people out.\n\nSo you might be wondering what happens if a firefighter doesn't pass the final driver's test.\n\nJackson: We've had that in the past, where students have not shown a proficient skill in driving the vehicles. You'll still go back to your firehouse and be, there's many other positions you can do, so sometimes they can come back. They train a little more at the firehouse and they come back, and then they're a little more proficient or they've gotten better where they pass with no problem.\n\nNarrator: So, next time you see a fire truck barreling towards you, just do what you can to get out of the way. The person behind the wheel of the 42-foot-long 40-ton truck will appreciate it."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Sophia Mitrokostas", "title": "15 fascinating things on Earth you had no idea existed", "description": "The Earth is wonderfully weird.

Already, 600,000 customers have come through the door at that location, according to O'Neill.\n\nA portion of the Nike store's floor is dedicated to shoes. Nike\n\nLet's get digital\n\nImmediately apparent when walking into the store is how important digital has become for the company, informing both online and offline initiatives for the brand.\n\n\"What you're seeing happen here is because we've watched how consumers shop online, and we think there's a lot of amazingness there that we can bring to a physical-shopping experience,\" O'Neill said.\n\nOne of the biggest ways it is doing this is allowing customers to interact with the store through the Nike app and Nike Plus, a free digital membership program.\n\n\"This store is built to come alive for members,\" O'Neill said.\n\nEarly response from customers has been positive, as O'Neill said the brand has signed up a new member every two minutes in the Shanghai store.\n\nThat's important, as those members are some of Nike's most loyal customers.\n\nNike Plus members \"shop more, they're more engaged, their average purchase price is higher,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"And it's just because they're having a better experience with the Nike brand.\"\n\nThe Nike Plus lounge is at the top of the store. Nike\n\nNike Plus members get perks like free courier delivery for purchases at the new store, free shipping for online purchases, and \"unlocks,\" which can include anything from exclusive access to in-demand shoes to members-only store hours. In a first for the company, the top floor is dedicated to Nike Plus members. It's where they can book one-on-one appointments with Nike experts or customize products to make them more personal.\n\nFor app users, Nike is launching two new features: shop the look and instant checkout. The store's mannequins are displayed throughout the store with QR codes, which the app can scan. Once the code is scanned, the app can tell you what the mannequin is wearing, which can then be delivered to a fitting room or brought out by an employee.\n\nInstant checkout is exactly what it sounds like. Scan the barcode of the item you're holding with your phone, press purchase, and walk out of the store. There are kiosks with hanger deposits and shopping bags.\n\nNike by New York\n\nThe very bottom of the store is what Nike calls the Speed Shop, which has its own entrance on 52nd Street.\n\nIt's the next evolution of what Nike has piloted with its Nike Live stores, the first of which opened as Nike by Melrose in Los Angeles this summer.\n\n\"For someone that might need to just stop in to pick up a new running shoe \u2014 be in and out or stop at lunch hour \u2014 we have that space,\" O'Neill said. \"That was the insight: to take the neighborhood experience of Melrose and make sure this store wasn't just for the globe. It was for New Yorkers.\"\n\nThe store goes up five flights and has a basement level. Nike\n\nThe bottom floor is packed with popular products that are designed to be grabbed and purchased as quickly as customers desire. Most of what is on the shelves was chosen in part by looking at sales data to determine the most popular products with New York customers.\n\nA sneaker bar, much like the one in the Melrose location, anchors the store, where customers can ask for sizes and checkout.\n\nThe new location comes after almost a year without a flagship store in Manhattan for the brand. Its former flagship, Niketown, closed in March. Niketown opened with a very \"Willy Wonka\"-esque model for shoes, with pneumatic tubes shooting product all over the store.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's gonna miss those,\" O'Neill said. \"Not when you can go to a mannequin, scan, press, and it's here.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Bob Bryan", "title": "Europe's trade chief said the EU is ready to fire back if Trump goes through with tariffs on cars", "description": "Cecilia Malmstrom, the top trade official for the European Union, was in the US on Wednesday.

It's not in-your-face, or gaudy, or any sort of cheap-looking bling; it's not overtly feminine, or overtly masculine. It's just ... luxurious.\n\nIt's hard to capture the color in a photo, but this image gives a hint of how gorgeous the device is:\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nIf you're not able to go to an Apple store to see the phone in person, this can be an understandably tough choice. It's easy to wonder if you'll get sick of the more adventurous color over time, or if it will turn out to look different in real life.\n\nBut as someone who's lived with the gold iPhone XS for going on 10 days now, I can tell you that it's exactly what you'll hope for, if not better.\n\nSo while the black is nice, and the white is tempting, when it comes to the iPhone XS, there's no question: buy the gold.\n\nYou won't be disappointed."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Jonathan Garber", "title": "Stocks slides as Apple enters a bear market", "description": "US equity markets fell for a fifth straight day.

Trump has repeatedly used the term to describe himself in recent weeks. According to The Washington Post, Trump took the comments as a personal attack.\n\nThe frosty meeting culminated in Trump's Twitter attack s on Tuesday that went after Macron's approval rating, France's trade treatment of US wines, and even France's World War II record.\n\nNot the first time\n\nTrump's back and forth with European leaders isn't the only time in recent memory that the president has clashed with the US's closest allies during an international trip.\n\nIn June, Trump fought with a variety of theoretically friendly world leaders at the G7 summit in Canada. During those meetings, Trump held awkward meetings with a slew of foreign leaders, including:\n\nAn encounter with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during which Trump tossed a Starburst candy onto the table and said, \"Here, Angela. Don't say I never give you anything.\"\n\nA meeting during which Trump complained about immigration and told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that if the US were to \"send him 25 million Mexicans,\" the prime minister would be \"be out of office very soon.\"\n\nA battle with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in which Trump made him the target of an extended Twitter tirade before, during, and after the meeting.\n\nWhile the fights add a layer of personal intrigue, they could also have some real world policy consequences.\n\nThe personal animus between Trudeau and Trump appeared to cause a delay in final negotiations over the updated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in August, while Macron and Merkel have ramped up calls for a pan-European defense force in the wake of Trump's NATO skepticism.\n\nWhile these spats are unlikely to undermine lengthy relationships, Trump's brash nature could cause consequential shifts in how the world treats the US.\n\nThe next chance for international fireworks comes at the end of November, when Trump is scheduled to travel to Argentina for the G20 summit. Most importantly Trump is set to hold his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping since the start of the US-China trade war."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kamran Rosen", "title": "Amazon has a no-fee credit card that Prime members should strongly consider opening \u2014 if only for the 5% cash back on all their Amazon and Whole Foods purchases", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nThere is no annual fee for the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card, and the $70 gift card received upon approval provides an immediate cash incentive. Amazon Instagram\n\nWith no annual fee, and an impressive 5% back on all Amazon and Whole Foods purchases (with a Prime membership), the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card is the highest tiered card of the four offered by e-commerce giant.\n\nWhile a $119 annual Amazon Prime membership fee might deter some people (though we think the cost is justified for these 14 reasons), the card has virtually no downsides for existing Prime members. With points redeemed seamlessly for cash on the Amazon site, the earning system is one of the most straightforward of any rewards card and adds instant savings for big users of the site.\n\nBenefits of the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card\n\nWhen it comes to rewards credit cards, the two important factors to keep in mind are how do you earn points and how do you burn points? And when it comes to the Amazon Prime Rewards, the answer for both is by shopping on Amazon Prime.\n\nIf you're not a Prime member, the first question is whether or not you want to pay for the service. Amazon's Prime currently costs $119 a year, or $12.99 a month, and has become tremendously popular, with Amazon disclosing it had reached 100 million subscribers worldwide last year. The free two-day shipping service has grown as Amazon has added streaming services via Prime video and exclusive offers to its members on Prime Day. New subscribers can sign up for a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime here.\n\nWhile the benefits justify the cost for many, we wouldn't argue joining Prime just to earn the 5% on this card (unless you spend over $6,000 a year on Amazon). If you don't plan on enrolling in Prime but still want to earn cash for using the site, we'd recommend checking out the standard Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card, which earns 3% back on Amazon purchases.\n\nHowever, for those who are existing Prime users, the Amazon Prime Rewards is definitely worth it.\n\nThere is no additional cost for the card, and you instantly and seamlessly earn 5% on every purchase made through Amazon and Whole Foods. Your card is automatically linked to your account, and Amazon makes it incredibly easy for you to use your points toward purchases. Available points are displayed at every checkout, where you have the option to put them toward your current purchase with the click of a button. No necessary portals, no redemption process.\n\nIf you're like me, there's no single company you'd rather have this deal with, as Amazon is basically a proxy for the entire online merchant ecosystem.\n\nVirtually everything is available there, and it appears to only be growing in inventory. For frequent shoppers of the platform, this is basically like earning 5% cash back on everything you buy \u2014 clothes, holiday and wedding gifts, or large electronics and furniture purchases. If you are living with roommates, you can order household essentials that are split between everyone and reap 5% while being the roommate who conveniently takes care of everything.\n\nYou can also earn cash back bonuses on certain specific products or categories by exploring the Prime Card Bonus Offers page. When you purchase something through that page, you'll get anywhere from 10-20% back.\n\nThe card also recently added its 5% cash back to Whole Foods purchases after the company was acquired by Amazon. This not only makes it one of the highest earning grocery cards we've seen (to those with loyalty to the brand), but its 2% back, restaurants, drug stores, and gas stations puts it on par with many all-around spending cards.\n\nOther Visa Signature benefits\n\nThe Amazon Prime Rewards is a Visa Signature Card, which grants it a number of travel, auto, and purchase protections you expect from other Visa Signature cards. These include:\n\nTravel accident insurance: When you pay for transportation with your Amazon Prime Rewards card, you are eligible to receive accidental death or dismemberment coverage of up to $500,000.\n\nWhen you pay for transportation with your Amazon Prime Rewards card, you are eligible to receive accidental death or dismemberment coverage of up to $500,000.

Purchase protection and extended warranty: New purchases are covered for 120 days against damage or theft up to $500 per claim and $50,000 per account. Eligible warranties of three years or less are also extended an additional year.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card is recommended for anyone who has an Amazon Prime membership. If you're already paying for the service, it's hard to justify not getting an additional 5% in cash back, unless you have a hard credit card limit.\n\nThere is no annual fee for the card, and the $70 gift card received upon approval provides an immediate cash incentive. Amazon has extended their 5% eligibility to Whole Foods, and it's not improbable to think the card's benefits will extend to other subsidiaries should Amazon continue their acquisition spree. The 2% back at restaurants, drug stores, and gas adds versatility to what is already highly efficient company-specific card.\n\nRead more about Amazon Prime membership benefits:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Graham Rapier", "title": "Winnebago could be one of the most unexpected winners of the self-driving car revolution (WGO)", "description": "Winnebago could seize on the self-driving car revolution by making autonomous pods, Morningstar theorizes.

Strelka Institute/Flickr/Attribution License\n\nWhen you face a problem at work, how you communicate it to your manager can have a big impact on whether or not you move to the next level in your career.\n\nIt's made a big difference in my own career and it's one of the top things I look for when I'm considering promoting people on my team.\n\nI lead research for Business Insider Intelligence and manage over 20 analysts and editors. At some point, everyone on my team has had an issue come up where they asked me to step in and help out. These issues are usually relatively tough to solve \u2014 otherwise they wouldn't need to be escalated. And that means new work and a new time commitment.\n\nA key to getting ahead is understanding that managers often have an overabundance of employees with problems, but the people that they most like to work with are those that solve them. Bringing a solution to the table rather than a problem is an indicator that you are competent and can be trusted to take on more responsibility.\n\nIt's really easy to spot competence. It's all in how you communicate the problems you're facing:\n\nLevel 1: 'I have a problem. What should I do?'\n\nThis is a very junior way to communicate a problem. You are creating more work for your manager because you are asking them to solve the problem for you.\n\nIt's okay for entry level employees or employees who are training for a new role, but if you don't get beyond this type of communication, your career is going to stagnate and you might even be let go.\n\nLevel 2: 'I have a problem. Here are potential solutions.'\n\nJust showing that you've thought about how to solve a problem is an indicator of next level potential. You're still giving your manager work, but if you provide good options for solving the problem, then it's a lot less work.\n\nRelated: Here's exactly how to write an email so your super busy boss gets back to you\n\nLevel 3a: 'I have a problem. Here are potential solutions. This is what I recommend. Here's why.'\n\nIf you can do this habitually and your recommendations are sound, your manager will absolutely love you. No matter what level you are in your career, there are situations where this is the best way to communicate a problem \u2014 some problems are going to be outside of your purview to solve and you need a nod from your manager, or the CEO, or the board before you can act (level 3b wouldn't be appropriate in these cases).\n\nLevel 3b: 'A problem came up. These were my options. I chose to do this, and here's why. It's handled.'\n\n\"It's handled\" is music to a busy manager's ears. This is how to communicate issues that have come up that you have authority to make a decision on. It keeps your manager in the loop, so if they're asked about the issue they aren't caught off guard, and it doesn't create additional work.\n\nRelated: 21 psychological tricks that will help you ace a job interview\n\nLevel 4: 'It sounds like you are having this problem. Here are some options to solve it. Here is how I can help.'\n\nIf you are anticipating your manager's needs and providing solutions, then you'll likely become his or her most relied-upon employee. This is someone who is operating at the next level. The caveat is that in order to do this effectively, your own responsibilities already need to be handled \u2014 otherwise it's going to backfire.\n\nLearning to communicate in a way that will get you to the next level is the easy part. The hard part is developing the skills to solve problems, coming up with good solutions, communicating competence habitually, and following through on what you say you are going to do.\n\nJohn Heggestuen is the Vice President of Research for Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium market research service covering digital transformation.

But learning shouldn't stop at a certain age or even career level. In today's fast-moving digital world, it's important to continually commit to expanding your knowledge base to get further in your current career \u2014 or explore a completely different one.\n\nLuckily, learning these new skills is as convenient as having access to a computer. Udemy, an online learning platform, offers 80,000 courses \u2014 starting at $9.99 for a Black Friday sale\u2014 taught by expert instructors across a variety of subject areas. Here are some to look into if you want to get ahead.\n\n1. Web development\n\nBeing able to design and create websites, along with the back-end technical aspects, is an invaluable skill. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean pay for web developers in 2017 was $74,110 annually and $35.63 an hour, but salaries at the top end of the scale can go as high as $122,320. And the number of jobs is expected to grow by 15% (faster than the average) between 2017 and 2026. Udemy's courses in Web development include programming languages such as HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript, MySQL, and more.\n\n2. Digital marketing\n\nDigital marketing can encompass everything from SEO and email marketing to social media strategy and analytics. And all of these tactics are important for making a business successful. In fact, according to a recent survey, 61% of marketers say improving SEO and growing their organic presence is their top inbound marketing priority. This is just one of the many skills you'll learn in Udemy's digital marketing course. Other topics include driving traffic and sales with YouTube; increasing Twitter followers; and getting likes on Facebook without paying for advertising.\n\n3. Artificial intelligence\n\nOver the past few years, artificial intelligence has officially hit the mainstream, with everything from smartphones to digital assistants incorporating the technology. That ubiquity has resulted in more job opportunities in this area: Since 2013, the number of US jobs requiring AI skills has grown 4.5 times. But understanding AI means combining data science, machine learning, and deep learning to create AI for real-world applications. Udemy offers several courses in AI\u2014 ranging from beginner skills to advanced classes in which you'll learn how to build an AI.\n\n4. Data science\n\nGlassdoor recently cited data scientist as the best job in America\u2014 and with good reason as it has an average base salary of $139,840. There are so many different skills under the data science umbrella \u2014 from programming to statistics and math to data visualization \u2014 that for those who choose to study it, the possibilities are endless. Udemy's classes in data science run from basic to advanced and cover the highs and lows of a career in this field, including corrupt data, anomalies, and irregularities. This gives students the best training and most accurate picture of this career.\n\n5. Photoshop\n\nEven if you're not a professional designer or photographer, knowing how to use Photoshop is a valuable skill to have. Most jobs require employees to make a presentation at some point, and it helps for them to be well designed and incorporate dynamic images. From a Photoshop crash course to a masterclass, Udemy offers courses for all skill levels. But no matter which you choose to take, you'll be taking a step toward impressive presentations.\n\n6. Media training\n\nMedia training is most useful for executives and others who are routinely interviewed by print, online, and TV journalists. But learning how to articulate a thought clearly and concisely is a skill that can transfer to anyone who wants to communicate effectively. That can mean giving a presentation at work or making a sales pitch to a potential client. Udemy's qualified instructors for media training will help you look and sound your best \u2014 whether in front of an audience of millions or a group of 10.\n\nAnd what's good about Udemy is that its courses are offered in a variety of skill levels. For example, aspiring digital marketers can take a 101 class that covers the basics, and programmers can take advanced courses in Python and e-gaming. So, whether it's digital marketing or data science, it's always a good time to keep learning \u2014 and Udemy's sitewide sales make it easy to do so.\n\nTake advantage of Udemy's legendary sitewide sale for Black Friday!

But when it comes to marketing, the startup wants to make sure that every dollar of its advertising spend is working as effectively as possible.\n\nParachute is one of a growing number of direct-to-consumer brands that are not only flipping the business models of big brands, but also the advertising industry. Unlike traditional marketers that love to focus on award-winning creative for TV ads, direct-to-consumer brands are laser-focused on data and use sophisticated tactics to analyze granular reams of data to figure out which ads are most effective at getting someone to either buy something, or visit a website, after seeing an ad.\n\nThat requires a new type of business model that largely centers around in-house teams tasked with creating the bulk of advertising for direct-to-consumer brands, and leaning on agencies and tech partners for project-based work.\n\nAt the same time, marketing clouds like Adobe, Salesforce, and Oracle are on a battle to either acquire or build out powerful tech stacks that help brands store and manage their data and then use it to run and measure targeted marketing campaigns.\n\nRead more: A new type of ad agency is catering to brands born on digital channels - and industry giants need a plan\n\nBut as direct-to-consumer brands continue to grow, the tension between building out cheaper tech and marketing expertise in-house versus working with big software companies is starting to play out, according to a dozen interviews with DTC brands, marketing clouds, agencies, and consultants.\n\n\"We abide by the philosophy that any of the touch points to interact with customers needs to be built out in house \u2014customer service, marketing, tech is in house,\" said Luke Droulez, CMO of Parachute. \"Within CRM and planning, it ultimately is better to tailor make a solution that fits your business model \u2014 the issue is plugging into a Salesforce or an Oracle at this stage in our business would be quite expensive.\"\n\nStill, marketing cloud execs are salivating over direct-to-consumer brands and the opportunity to help data-minded marketers organize their stats and run targeted campaigns.\n\nAccording to research from Salesforce and Deloitte Digital, the average brand uses 39 pieces of technology to handle its so-called consumer engagement.\n\n\"A lot of these new brands didn't inherit an existing marketing organization, structure, or organizational design. Many of these teams built their marketing, advertising, loyalty, CRM data business all tightly aligned,\" said Dave Helmreich, group VP of Oracle Marketing Cloud.\n\nAs a result, many DTC brands built out their technology stacks in-house. As they grow, the pitch from marketing clouds is that they need deep technology chops to help them scale in the market, which they can't get from building their own technology in-house, Helmreich said.\n\nThat can result in a few different models: An \"all-in\" model where brands put all of their technology stack into a marketing cloud, or a hybrid model where brands lean on several tech companies to power different portions of their technology stack and house it within a marketing cloud.\n\n\"They realize when they're getting to significant scale [and] large market footprint, they need an enterprise solution \u2014 many of these companies grow up from engineering and very technical backgrounds,\" he said. \"We see fewer and fewer companies spending their engineering time building tools that exist in the market. They tend to spend that time focused on things that they can control and that actually is of unique value to them and that's in order management and creative.\"\n\nDollar Shave Club, for example, recently picked Adobe's Advertising Cloud as its \"primary demand-side platform\" (or DSP) and plans to use more of the marketing cloud company's tools to handle programmatic advertising, according to Adweek.\n\nDirect-to-consumer brands have been a hot topic recently for media M&A banker Terry Kawaja and CEO of Luma Partners. He gave a talk about the rise of direct-to-consumer brands at the Association of National Advertisers' Masters of Marketing Conference last month about how young direct-to-consumer brands are quickly growing without a lot of capital.\n\n\"They sure as heck come to the table far more sophisticated in the martech side of things,\" he said. \"That's what's attracting the cloud guys.\"\n\nHere's a chart that shows how big the DTC industry is, according to Luma Partners:\n\nThe landscape of direct-to-consumer brands Luma Partners\n\nKawaja said part of the reason why marketing clouds have their sights set on direct-to-consumer brands is because \"it's a sexy category,\" meaning they can build out case studies with direct-to-consumer brands. The companies' pitch \"goes a lot further when it's a DTC brand,\" he said.\n\nMarketers are balancing working with partners versus working in-house\n\nDirect-to-consumer brands are notorious for handling their advertising and marketing in-house, partly because of the cost of outsourcing technology and the lack of ability to create custom tech stacks with individual pieces of technology.\n\nMatt Prohaska, CEO and principal of Prohaska Consulting, added that it can be tough for brands to stitch all of their technology together when going all-in on one marketing cloud. Such deals look \"smart on paper but it's always hard to get the integration down,\" he said.\n\nDollar Shave Club competitor and grooming brand Harry's does not use a single marketing cloud, said Pete Christman, head of acquisition marketing.\n\nHarry's marketing is split between three internal teams: A direct-to-consumer team handles acquisition efforts, a retail group focuses on shopper marketing, and an omnichannel team oversees the brand's marketing across its business. Within the direct-to-consumer team, a group of five is specifically focused solely on growth, which occasionally works with partners but tries to handle the bulk of work in-house.\n\n\"We do have a tech stack that we've built up over time, but we don't work with a single partner that's a full-service marketing cloud provider,\" Christman said. \"Instead, we think about the different types of tech that support the type of marketing that we're doing [that] is going to pay for itself.\"\n\nIn one example, Harry's built an internal tool that allows the brand to test different landing pages and messaging that consumers see after clicking on an ad.\n\n\"In my experience, I found that it's wisest for us not to sign up lots of different tech tools before we're completely confident that adding that tool to our stack will result in improved important performance session,\" he said. \"There's a lot of shiny new things out there and there is a lot of consolidation where a tool that used to just do one thing is now adding dimensions to it that try to account for more of your needs.\"\n\nStartups are scrappier with smaller resources than big brands\n\nChristman is not alone in resisting a single marketing cloud.\n\nBrandless, which is a direct-to-consumer grocery and home essentials company, also does not use a marketing cloud to house all of its data.\n\n\"I don't quite believe that they work fully through,\" Brandless CMO Aaron Magness told Business Insider. \"My focus is on building a team and then we can worry about tools without relying on someone else's stack.\"\n\nBrandless\n\nPart of the problem with buying into big software packages is that direct-to-consumer brands don't have the same positions as big brands have. A Fortune 500 company, for instance, may have a team dedicated to handling enterprise deals with software companies, said Will Flaherty, VP of growth at Ro.\n\n\"It may be easier [for big brands] because there's a big decision maker who can kind of compel the division to use it,\" he said. \"The truth is, in some ways it's almost easier for an emerging company to kind of pick and choose the components of a tech stack that makes sense for that particular brand.\"\n\nInstead, Flaherty said that the crop of emerging data platforms \u2014 think mParticle or Segment \u2014 help wrangle bits of data together and route it to specific channels.\n\n\"Some of those platforms have made it easier to cobble together a bunch of different services rather than going with the marketing cloud, all-in-one approach,\" he said.\n\nSimilar to how brands are wary to go all-in on one agency, marketers may not want to pour resources into one marketing cloud, particularly for new direct-to-consumer brands that are working to build a brand.\n\n\"It's all over the place and that's because these businesses are being built with marketing talent at various levels \u2014 it's kind of the Wild West for the marketing clouds,\" said JB Osborne, CEO and cofounder of Red Antler, an agency that specializes in working with startups and direct-to-consumer brands. \"It's very different than large companies who are mostly worried about creating standards and consistency and getting everyone to do the same thing at the right time and the right way. With startups, it's inherently messy and scrappy regardless of the exact scale of the business.\"\n\nBrands are forking over parts of their technology to tech companies though\n\nHowever, there are certain big parts of business that brands do want to outsource, like analytics, or an e-commerce platform to power their website.\n\nThe direct-to-consumer makeup brand Milk Makeup works with Salesforce's commerce cloud to run its e-commerce site, for example. The brand treats its website similar to a real-time platform to upload and test content instead of relying on a web developer.\n\n\"We're changing our homepages and banners on a daily basis,\" said Morgan Fleming, senior director of e-commerce at Milk Makeup. \"Customers are visiting more pages on our site, the sessions are longer and they're spending more time on our product pages.\"\n\nMilk Makeup is an example of a larger trend that Salesforce is seeing where brands hand off the reins to a technology partner to free up time for longer-term priorities like making products or figuring out distribution logistics.\n\nThe pricing model for powering websites is based on the percentage of e-commerce sales for the brand using a gross merchandising value model.\n\n\"There's so much competition and what brands are looking for is agility to stay one step ahead of the customer and two steps ahead of their competition,\" said Rob Garf, VP of industry strategy and insights at Salesforce. \"We have found that with a more unified approach \u2014 not just in marketing \u2014 in the entire journey, we're finding companies enabling a lot more agility by simplifying their technology environments, consolidating consumer data, and being able to unlock that data and make it actionable.\"\n\nDTC brands are struggling to make Facebook work\n\nFor many direct-to-consumer brands, they built their business on Facebook ads that targeted specific segments of consumers.\n\nAs Facebook's algorithm and ad prices have changed though, many are experimenting with more traditional types of advertising like print, TV, and billboards.\n\n\"Most brands now are wary of being too reliant on Facebook or are finding it harder to make Facebook work the way that it did before,\" said Red Antler's Osborne. \"Most businesses are spending the majority of their money on advertising with Facebook and Google, but that's just the landscape today \u2014 they're actively trying to find as many alternative channels and ways to reach customers.\"\n\nThat means that direct-to-consumer brands are dependent on data from the walled gardens of Facebook and Google, which are notoriously hard for third parties like marketing clouds to measure. If they continue to shift money away from Facebook and Google, DTC brands may find that they need to work more closely with a marketing cloud than they do now, said Sam Appelbaum, general manager of Yellowhammer, a specialist ad agency that primarily works with direct-to-consumer brands.\n\n\"Martech allows for horizontal insights across all of your marketing and media [but] is less effective when the integrations with those platforms are not as tight,\" he said. \"It could be that as direct-to-consumer brands rely less on something like Facebook to drive business, these solutions will make more sense for them.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Thomas Colson and Adam Bienkov", "title": "Read Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal in full", "description": "Theresa May has published the full text of her draft Brexit withdrawal deal.

The acquisition of New York broker dealer ITG for $1 billion, which Virtu announced last week, could position the firm for success in those businesses. It's not its first large deal. In 2017, the firm acquired KCG which opened Virtu up to global quant strategies in equities and futures.\n\nThat acquisition was viewed widely on Wall Street as a success.\n\nAs for the ITG acquisition, which is set to close in early 2019, there are concerns about conflicts of interest. Specifically, market observers are worried about Virtu's stock trading business \u2014 which trades the firm's capital \u2014 peeking into its new broker-dealer business and using that information to trade against clients.\n\nIts an issue that's important to CEO Doug Cifu who said in an interview that the firm is building a committee of global clients to oversee the firm to ensure that data is protected. Cifu also spoke about the firm's future plans for growth and its unique military culture.\n\nFrank Chaparro: Let's get into the reasoning behind the deal. It appears to be part of the game plan to build out the client-facing brokerage business? And what's the logic behind entering that market?\n\nDoug Cifu: Our agency execution services took a huge step forward with our acquisition of KCG in 2017 and our agreement to buy ITG is a natural next step in further expanding our transparent global technology and liquidity solutions for our clients.\n\nThis is the first time a broker has applied performance and scaled financial technology to a traditional brokerage model; this is what banks and brokers had been trying to do. Clients benefit by using the same DNA that we use and develop for ourselves, and ITG's products and offerings will be enriched with the same.\n\nAs I've said publicly, ITG's key offerings comprise a complete suite of agency execution services, including liquidity sourcing, trading algorithms, single stock and program trading, workflow technology, and trading analytics - products and services that its clients rely on to manage their day-to-day operations, risk management and fiduciary responsibilities. Each of ITG's businesses operate in areas that utilize trading technologies which are core to Virtu's businesses and stand to benefit from our common R&D and shared technology plant.\n\nChaparro: What does the deal say about the market for high-frequency trading firms in your opinion?\n\nCifu: The KCG and ITG deals further demonstrate the difference between what most folks consider \"HFT\" and the market's appreciation for the value an electronic market maker like Virtu, who competes to provide risk transference services, brings to the financial markets.\n\nI think the deal also highlights the importance of scale and the role that scaled operators like Virtu will play in future consolidation. As our markets continue to become more connected and more competitive, scale is essential to compete in our technology driven financial services markets. Because of the robust competition in the marketplace and the demand from clients for cutting edge technology, firms like ours must continually invest in technology and talent. In order to operate profitably in this environment, it becomes necessary to operate at significant scale.\n\nChaparro: Are there any other areas the firm is interested in exploring to build out, either organically or through another acquisition?\n\nCifu: The ITG combination gives us a slate of organic growth opportunities. As combined firms, Virtu and ITG have built incredible franchises with very complementary products and geographies. While these businesses are distinct and unique from what Virtu does today, they revolve around a common technology infrastructure - like the one I was just describing. For example, I'm excited to offer Virtu's expertise and access to the global FX markets across ITG's suite of execution services, workflow technology and analytics franchises.\n\nOur first order of business is to take the great ITG products, Analytics, Workflow Technology, and Commission Management Aggregation products and invest in them, and of course, we're going to enhance safeguards and transparency around the protection of client data.\n\nI can't overstate how important it is to me personally that client information is properly protected and, to that end, we're talking to the buy-side about establishing a client data governance committee made up of clients from all over the globe to assist in the oversight, design, implementation, and integrity of logical and physical barriers. It's still early and we are engaging the buy-side, getting their input, but the idea is that clients would oversee the management of their data and be empowered to recommend and engage an outside auditing firm and the meetings will be open to the all clients.\n\nThe committee concept is an extension of our history of always pushing for more transparency and using technology to deliver more transparency. This is a good thing - no other firm gives this much transparency to its clients into how their information is protected.\n\nChaparro: Virtu is known for its unique company culture (hard work ethic, military-esque, virtuous). What's your best piece of advice for the ITG employees who will join after the acquisition for finding success at the firm?\n\nCifu: That's a good question, our culture is a bit unique and it's something we're quite proud of. I'd say, don't worry about titles or who you report to, we're not big fans of titles or org charts at Virtu. Titles and org charts tend to make people think and work in silos, which is not who we are. Virtu is a meritocracy that rewards folks who can identify opportunities, propose and implement solutions, and lead others by example to improve the firm.\n\nFrank Chaparro is a senior correspondent at The Block, a cryptocurrency and blockchain news site.

In fact, I didn't feel comfortable in my own skin \u2014 and I certainly didn't feel like being the center of attention as the birthday girl.\n\nThat was in July 2018. Since getting married in 2014 and facing personal and family struggles over the previous few years, the pounds had slowly accumulated until I barely recognized myself in the mirror. All told, I was about 40 pounds over my ideal weight.\n\nIt was time to make a change \u2014 a lasting change. I was tired of trying fad diets and watching my weight yo-yo. I decided to lose weight the old-fashioned way: diet and exercise.\n\nBut I had an ace up my sleeve: an app that counts calories and provides nutritional advice. A friend of mine had used MyFitnessPal (made by Under Armour) with great success, and it immediately came to mind when I made the decision to diet.\n\nTracking calories with MyFitnessPal\n\nMyFitnessPal; Chelsea Greenwood/Business Insider\n\nThe day after my birthday, I downloaded the MyFitnessPal app, filled out its survey with my current weight and goals, and started keeping track of every calorie I ate. I also committed to working out five or six days a week for an hour at a time on my stationary bike.\n\nAt first, counting calories was hard. I kept forgetting to log snacks \u2014 which made me realize I was snacking too much \u2014 and had trouble meeting my daily calorie goal of 1,200. Considering I'm a writer and math-averse, it was also difficult to figure out the calorie content of foods I'd prepared myself. (Boxed foods are easy, though, because you can just scan the barcode with the app, and it logs all the nutrition info.)\n\nSoon, I got used to tracking my calories \u2014 thanks in part to the regular push notifications from MyFitnessPal to log each meal \u2014 and I started making progress. I lost about eight pounds within the first month and could already see a difference around my midsection. And I don't feel like I'm depriving myself, either.\n\nMyFitnessPal; Chelsea Greenwood/Business Insider\n\nIn addition to being mindful of calories, I pay attention to the fat, carb, and protein content of the foods I'm eating, as noted by MyFitnessPal in a handy pie chart, and adjust accordingly. At one point, I realized my high-protein breakfast sandwich was nearly blowing my daily fat allotment before 9 a.m. and immediately made a switch.\n\nThe app alerts you when you're nearing your fat, carb, sugar, or sodium limit for the day so you can try to avoid foods laden with those for the rest of the day. It also cheers you on with positive messages when you hit milestones, such as losing five pounds or tracking for a certain amount of days in a row \u2014 kind of like a personal diet coach in your pocket.\n\nRead more: 8 free fitness apps that can help you get in shape \u2014 and what they're best for\n\nI've stuck with it as best I can, generally toeing the line during the week and sometimes veering off track on weekends.

If I'm afraid I've gone up in weight and don't want to face the scale for a weigh-in, I just stick to my regimen for another week or two until I feel confident that I've compensated for my transgressions.\n\nSeeing results\n\nIt's been a little over four months now, and I've lost 28 pounds. I feel and look better than I have in maybe a decade, and I find I'm actually enjoying getting dressed and trying new fashions. Now that I'm 35, it's kind of like a new chapter in my life, and I'm deciding what that means for me and the way I present myself to the world.\n\nI still have about 12 pounds left to lose before I hit my goal, but I'm confident I'll get there.

But some activists say toxic chemicals from Santa Susana likely contaminated the surrounding smoke and ash.\n\nIn the 1940s, the US government began using Santa Susana to test nuclear weapons and rockets. The facility spans more than 2,800 acres on the border of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. A partial nuclear meltdown in 1959 caused radioactive material and carcinogens to contaminate the surrounding soil and groundwater, and some reports say the meltdown released more radioactive material than any other nuclear accident in US history.\n\nIn a Friday statement, the Department of Toxic Substances Control said its scientists and toxicologists \"reviewed information about the fire's location and do not believe the fire has caused any releases of hazardous materials that would pose a risk to people exposed to the smoke.\"\n\nA follow-up statement released Tuesday said staff members had tested the site over the weekend and did not find elevated levels of radiation. The department said it would conduct more air and soil testing over the next several days.\n\nA group of physicians says the damage to Santa Susana could affect residents' health\n\nSome activists are concerned that the area surrounding Santa Susana may not be not safe for residents. Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles, a group that advocates for the elimination of nuclear and environmental threats, says the fire likely released toxins into the air.\n\n\"We know what substances are on the site and how hazardous they are,\" Dr. Robert Dodge, the organization's president, said in a statement. \"These toxic materials are in SSFL's soil and vegetation, and when it burns and becomes airborne in smoke and ash, there is real possibility of heightened exposure for area residents.\"\n\nA 1997 study found that workers at the Santa Susana site had elevated rates of cancer in connection with nuclear activity at the complex. If radioactive particles were released into the air, it is possible that similar health effects could be observed among nearby residents.\n\nHowever, Kai Vetter, a professor of nuclear engineering at University of California Berkeley, told the Los Angeles Times that the health effects of smoke inhalation are greater than any potential danger from radioactive particles in the air.\n\n\"Although there is a possibility that radioactive materials \u2014 accounted for or not \u2014 could be dispersed through the fire and the smoke plume, the risk for health effects due to radiation is expected to be small,\" Vitter said.\n\nThis Feb. 12, 2009 photo shows buildings at the old Rocketdyne facility, the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, in the Simi Valley area near Los Angeles. Reed Saxon/AP\n\nThe physicians' group also criticized the California Department of Toxic Substances Control for having \"no public confidence,\" and pointed out that state lawmakers commissioned an independent review panel in 2015 to monitor the department's public outreach, fiscal management, and enforcement of hazardous-waste laws. The clean-up process at Santa Susana has faced delays\n\nMost of the Santa Susana site is owned by Boeing, though NASA oversees one area and the US Department of Energy leases a portion as well. A Boeing spokeswoman told the Los Angeles Times that more than 50% of the company's property at Santa Susana burned.\n\nA 2007 order instructed the three parties to finish cleaning up the site by 2017, but those clean-up efforts have repeatedly hit delays. In August, the Ventura County Star reported another delay: an action plan that was supposed to come out in the first half of 2019 is now behind schedule.\n\nThese delays have drawn backlash from local community members. Last year, a group of parents called for tougher clean-up standards, claiming their children's cancer diagnoses were linked to the nuclear research site. The group delivered a petition with more than 17,000 signatures to state officials.\n\nInvestigators have not yet determined what caused the Woolsey Fire. Last week, however, utility company Southern California Edison told state regulators that an outage was reported at one of its substations a few minutes before the fire began. The outage was in the same area where Woolsey broke out; in fact, the substation is located within the Santa Susana complex.\n\nRead more: Before-and-after photos show the devastating destruction in Malibu as the California wildfires rage on\n\nSouthern California Edison spokesman Steve Conroy told the Los Angeles Times that the company is required to file a report whenever an incident may be connected to another event.\n\n\"The report is preliminary,\" Conroy said. \"We have no other information other than a line went out of service and we don't know why.\"\n\nThe Woolsey Fire has killed two people and burned through more than 150 square miles."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Shana Lebowitz", "title": "Here's exactly how to write an email so your super busy boss gets back to you", "description": "When you email your boss, be sure to start the message with a phrase like, \"Do you think...?\" Then outline a potential solution to the problem.

Juul said on Tuesday that it will not delete its Twitter or YouTube accounts but will confine the content posted on both of those channels to materials about quitting smoking and customer support.\n\nBut Juul's social media presence began years ago, and the results of that campaign, which flourished, may now be difficult to rein in.\n\nA 2016 Juul ad.

He had been working as a successful exec at Google before his brother prodded him into joining Qualtrics instead.\n\nDespite a career full of success, Smith told Business Insider back in 2016 that he doesn't like to work, \"as a matter of principle.\" He likes to travel.\n\nStill, he's so good at what he does \u2014 building tech products and managing people \u2014 that companies from startups to Google have begged him to work for them, turning him first into a millionaire and, as of Sunday, a billionaire, almost in spite of himself.\n\nTeen tech star\n\nHis phenomenal career story began when he was in high school in Utah.\n\nHe got an internship at word-processing-software maker WordPerfect, which was bought by Novell. He worked his way up to product manager by age 18.\n\nBut Microsoft was killing Novell, so Novell hired Eric Schmidt as CEO. That's when the teenage Smith first met him.\n\nAlthough Schmidt didn't end up saving Novell, he did give it a few years of breathing room. Then Novell began tanking again, and Smith quit his high-paying job to go to college in London, studying economics.\n\nQualtrics cofounder Jared Smith. Business Insider While in London he learned he was a \"horrible\" driver. So after he graduated, he took a job in a startup called Juice Software in New York, just to live in a city where he wouldn't have to drive.\n\nJuice was started by Kim Scott (who would later lure him to Google). The company designed software for the financial-services industry.\n\nIt launched on September 10, 2001.\n\nThe next day was 9/11. New York was in tatters, as was Smith's apartment, which was near the World Trade Center towers.\n\nUltimately, the company bounced back and was sold to Microsoft. But as soon as he could \u2014 and before it was sold \u2014 Smith left New York to decompress. He spent a year hitchhiking around South America.\n\nHaving hitchhiked around Africa in college, he was an \"incredibly seasoned traveler\" who wasn't afraid of dangerous situations, he said. Still, his trip ended in Caracas, Venezuela, when he got caught in the \"oil riots and coup against [then President] Chavez. It was really tense,\" he said. \"Tear gas in the plazas and everything else.\"\n\nIt was time to go home to Utah.\n\nA new product and a fistfight\n\nBack home, his dad, BYU professor Dr. Scott Smith, had been diagnosed with cancer. The prognosis wasn't good. His younger brother, Ryan, had moved home to be with his dad. They were working in the basement \"twiddling around on a survey product,\" and they asked Smith to help them sell it.\n\nHe looked at the product, declared it \"worthless\" and built them a new version, which would ultimately become the product used by millions of people and lead the company to big profits and a big valuation.\n\nQualtrics brothers and cofounders CEO Ryan Smith and COO Jared Smith. Qualtrics He also convinced Ryan to change the name of the company to Qualtrics, from a variety of product names it was using. \"Ryan and I got in a fistfight at a restaurant over that,\" he laughed.\n\nThe brothers and cofounders are opposites in every way; they disagree often, but they rarely come to blows.\n\nThey usually fight, dig in, and then compromise, he said. \"Normally, in every argument we're both right.\"\n\nMeanwhile, his dad made a miraculous recovery thanks to the doctors at the Huntsman Cancer Center. (Qualtrics just donated a $1 million to Huntsman and launched the Five for the Fight campaign.)\n\nWith the product built and his dad on the mend, Smith hired the company's first engineer and told his brother he was leaving again.\n\nHe didn't want to work on Qualtrics. That was \"always Ryan's dream,\" he said.\n\nHe wanted to travel. He bought a ticket to New Zealand intending to hitchhike through Asia.\n\nRight before he left, Kim Scott called. She was working for Google and was offering him a job that would change his life, and Qualtrics, forever.\n\nDragged to Google\n\nSmith didn't want to work there. \"I was opposed to work on principal. I was going to go traveling. This tells you how stupid I was,\" he said.\n\nKim Scott. Qualtrics This was the end of 2004, right after the IPO when the stock was trading at under $200 and employees' stock options sold for far less than that.\n\nScott wouldn't give up. She flew him out to Mountain View at Google's expense, where he reluctantly interviewed.\n\n\"I think the only reason I got the job is that I didn't really want the job and they thought I was so humble,\" he says. 'It was like, 'How are you at this?' I was like, 'I suck at this.'\"\n\nFor instance, he says of his programming skills, \"I'm a hacker at best. I have good design skills, but I would not consider myself an engineer. I'm not a computer scientist. I'm an economist. Compared to Google engineers, I would never make it in the engineering department.\"\n\nScott disagrees, calling him a great coder. He saw Google's daunting hiring process as a challenge, and did well, she remembers. And after he was hired, he earned the respect of the Google engineers, who even let him code a few things himself, the first non-engineer at Google given that honor, Scott said.\n\nBut, according to Kim Scott, Smith's real gift is guiding engineers to build products that wowed the business side:\n\nI could go to him with an acorn idea and he would go away for a weekend and come back with the whole oak tree, taking conceptually what I meant, making it look beautiful and actually building it. He gets more work done in a 24-hour period than any other human being I've ever encountered.\n\nFrom Google, to quagmire, to Qualtrics\n\nHe took the job at Google and discovered he didn't fit in, he recalled, thanks to his time at Novell.\n\nDeep Nishar. Business Insider / Matthew Lynley \"I ruffled some feathers,\" he said. \"Google was straightforward and you had to play no games. You just had to use data and be honest. Novell was much more political and all about fiefdoms.\"\n\nWith Scott's help, he learned the Google way and did well. He worked on ad products, then on internal tools for the sales team. He learned how to hire and manage.\n\nHe got stock options, which a New York financial-industry friend advised him not to sell off every month like the other employees did. So he held onto them all.\n\nOne day, he went to lunch with his friend, Deep Nishar, another well-respected product manager. At the end of lunch, Deep asked him to lead Google's products in China.\n\n\"It didn't make sense. How do you lead products if you don't speak the language? So I turned him down. Similarly stupid to turning Kim down,\" Smith said.\n\nDeep was also persistent, and eventually Smith was talked into the China job, working under \"Kai-Fu Lee, the guy we stole from Microsoft,\" he said. (Lee's resignation caused Steve Ballmer to throw a chair at Lee, and declare war on Google and Eric Schmidt, court documents later revealed.)\n\nOnce again, he was scaling an operation from a few people to hundreds, this time in a foreign country.\n\nReuters Under Lee, Google China grew from 9% market share to 30% share \u2014 and to about 900 people, Smith said.\n\nThen Google discovered that hackers, presumably from the government, were attacking Google to help track down dissidents. Google went public about it all, but the PR was terrible all the same.\n\nUnhappy with the situation, Google yanked its operations out of China, moving them to Hong Kong.\n\n\"I had a front-row seat through all of that,\" he remembered. The situation put him, a product manager, in constant contact with some of Google's most senior executives, including Schmidt.\n\nMeanwhile, Qualtrics was taking off, too. It had customers. It was profitable. Ryan now had 40 employees and he was calling Smith regularly for advice, hounding him to quit Google and come back to help at Qualtrics.\n\nRyan pressed: How high did Google's shares have to go before he was willing to sell them all and become wealthy enough to quit Google and come work for his startup? Google had been flirting around the $600 mark.\n\n\"And in a moment of weakness, I gave him the price,\" he says. It was a price that would make Smith financially well off for life.\n\nThe day the shares hit that price, Ryan called Smith. \"I sold all my shares the same day,\" he says. Then Ryan flew out, helped him pack and escorted Smith back to Utah.\n\n'Rude' to VCs\n\nThe truth was the whole China thing had also worn him out. But when he got to the startup, he said, \"I was bored. A 40-person operation, it took me about 20 minutes a day to manage.\"\n\nBut the company \"was a sales machine\" and growing. Soon he was back to hiring and scaling.\n\nVCs had also found Qualtrics and were calling. Ryan was \"rude\" to them, Smith said, and Ryan confirmed. He saw investors like predatory lenders. \"Why would I want to take on a mortgage?\" Ryan Smith remembers telling them. Ryan also turned down a $500 million acquisition offer.\n\nBut eventually Ryan decided that he wanted a board of people who had grown huge tech companies. That meant VCs, and they would want a stake in the company.\n\nSmith hated the idea. \"I thought it was silly to sell any part of the company because it was doing so well, profitably, growing 100% year on year,\" he recalled.\n\nRyan Smith and Jared Smith. Qualtrics So the brothers fought. They dug in. They compromised. \"The detente was if he could raise $100 million, for a small percentage of the company, then we would fund raise,\" Smith said.\n\nRyan got the terms that Smith demanded.\n\nAnd, looking back, Smith said, \"Ryan was incredibly right.\" The cash and the board pushed Qualtrics to grow in new ways. Without it they would have gotten \"fat and lazy,\" satisfied with the old product and the profits it generated, Smith admitted.\n\nAs for the investors, \"They've all done phenomenally well. A dream investment,\" he says.\n\nWhile Qualtrics, a private company, doesn't release revenue, and is officially valued at a billion as of its last raise \u2014 $150 million in 2014, $220 million total raised \u2014 at one point, Smith told attendees at its annual customer conference last month that it was a \"multibillion\" company. It claims over 8,000 customers. In any case, it's still highly profitable.\n\nAs Qualtrics grew, Smith implemented all of the employee-management tools he learned at Google, plus he wrote a few new ones.\n\n\"I really love building systems that transform organizations,\" he said. And since Qualtrics is his company, he's been known to take liberties. \"Imagine Ryan's surprise when one day he walks in and I've coded something that puts all the salespeople on a curve and made it public. That's radical transparency.\"\n\nThe company now has closer to 1,000 employees, including seasoned leaders. It just launched a second generation of survey products and a new set of data-analysis products, retiring the original product Smith built in the basement 12 years ago.\n\nAnd Smith is once again talking about not working.\n\n\"I put all the processes, machinery, and management stuff in place to scale the organization. Ryan is the CEO. I've started to slow down and spend more time at my beach house to give execs more space to work. When I left Google, I thought I was retiring, and I'd like to end up there again,\" he said.\n\nThen again, if Ryan were to call him and insist he take on something new, he could be dragged in, again. \"Everyone knows that eventually I'll get bored.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Meghan Morris", "title": "Private equity hiring has never been hotter, with VPs receiving up to four job offers a week", "description": "Private equity is seeing the most active hiring market ever, as demand increases from new managers and existing firms, according to a new report.

Dozens of Israeli soldiers had reportedly offloaded just before the missile strike. Zilber emphasized it is difficult to prove whether the missile team watched the bus offload, but this could be an attempt to limit casualties.\n\nZilber said with these types of strikes, Hamas is playing a \"clever game.\"\n\n\"Hamas has learned that Israel and [Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu don't really want a war,\" he said.\n\nThe attacks were preceded by a positive week for Gazans, who received the first installation of Qatari financial aid.

Only Proxima Centauri, a three-star system, is closer.\n\nWhat's more, the newly discovered world is close enough to Earth \u2014 yet far enough from its blindingly bright star \u2014 to be photographed by a new generation of giant telescopes.\n\n\"This is probably the first Earth-sized planet we will directly image by future missions,\" Abel M\u00e9ndez, an astrobiologist at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo who wasn't involved in the study, told Business Insider.\n\nThe new world is known as Barnard's star b or, in other circles, GJ 699 b. The team that found it used more than 20 years' worth of telescope observations, and the data suggests the planet is at least 3.2 times as massive as Earth and has a 233-day year.\n\nThe world appears to orbit in Barnard's star's \"snow line,\" a region just on the edge of the habitable zone, where liquid water can exist on the surface of a planet.\n\nFor that reason, scientists consider the possible planet to be a \"cold super-Earth,\" and some are wondering whether alien life might exist there.\n\nWhat it might be like on Barnard's star b\n\nESO/M. Kornmesser\n\nBarnard's star is not like the sun. It's what astronomers call an M dwarf, meaning it's smaller, cooler (and redder), less massive, and billions of years older.\n\n\"M dwarfs are prime targets for planetary searches, because they favor the detection of small companions,\" or planets, Rodrigo F. D\u00edaz, an astrophysicist at the University of Buenos Aires who wasn't part of the research team, wrote in a Nature \"News and Views\" piece.\n\nThis is because M-dwarf stars are small enough to \"wobble\" when rocky planets orbit them. Such wobbling happens because the gravity of the planet and the star mutually tug at each other. (A planet's orbit is rarely perfectly circular.) Some telescopes can detect this behavior.\n\nBarnard's star b took a long time to find because red dwarf stars often have sunspots, which can throw off sensitive measurements. Pooling together more than two decades' worth of telescope observations, however, helped the research team find the signal of a presumable planet in the noise of Barnard's star's light.\n\nAn illustration showing the sun in relation to Barnard's star and the Alpha Centauri triple-star system. IEEC/Science-Wave/Guillem Ramisa\n\nThe newly discovered planet is about as far from its star as Mercury is from the sun. That's fairly close. But being next to a smaller and cooler star puts Barnard's star b at the edge of the habitable zone.\n\nPractically, this means the surface temperature of Barnard's star b is most likely -150 degrees Celsius. That's cold enough to freeze carbon dioxide into dry ice, let alone water into ice.\n\nBut bone-chilling temperatures don't mean the exoplanet is a dead world bereft of liquid water.\n\nCan a cold super-Earth be habitable?\n\nHalf of Jupiter's icy moon Europa as seen via images taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990s. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SETI Institute\n\nThe surface of Europa, an icy moon that orbits Jupiter, is about 10 degrees colder than Barnard's star b. And Enceladus, a smaller icy moon around Saturn, is some 40 degrees colder than Europa.\n\nYet both tiny worlds \u2014 and many more in the solar system\u2014 hide expansive oceans of salt water beneath their crusts. There's also growing evidence that organic molecules are mixed into that liquid too.\n\nThe researchers' estimate of Barnard's star b's temperature also assumes it has no atmosphere. But it very well could.\n\n\"Since the planet is more massive than Earth, it may retain a hydrogen atmosphere,\" Sara Seager, the deputy science director for NASA's TESS mission and an astrophysicist at MIT who wasn't involved in the study, told Business Insider. \"Hydrogen is a potent greenhouse gas and could conceivably keep the surface temperature warm enough for life, if the atmospheric pressure is high enough.\"\n\nIt's not a far-fetched idea. Seager said all planets \u2014 even Earth \u2014 are born with a hydrogen atmosphere. This is because hydrogen is the dominant material in nebulas, the clouds of gas and dust out of which stars (and their planets) form.\n\n\"Assuming it has the estimated minimum mass, then it is probably a rocky or frozen ocean world with a thick atmosphere, maybe like Titan in the solar system,\" M\u00e9ndez said.\n\nOn the other hand, 3.2 Earth masses is a minimum estimate for the new world's size. M\u00e9ndez added that \"its mass could be larger and therefore a mini-Neptune.\"\n\nThe first photo of a rocky exoplanet\n\nA laser on the Thirty Meter Telescope is designed to help the observatory take space-quality images. TMT\n\nAstronomers have already taken photos of very large exoplanets. They're akin to giant Jupiters or failed stars, though, meaning they're all extremely hot, gassy, and uninhabitable.\n\nFuture ground observatories like the European Extremely Large Telescope in Chile, or perhaps even the Thirty Meter Telescope in Hawaii, may be able to capture a small image of Barnard's star b.\n\nAssuming the exoplanet does indeed exist, it may look like a tiny dot or blob in an image. But the data trapped in such a picture could tell scientists whether it's small and rocky like Earth, or big and gassy like Neptune, or somewhere in between.\n\nWhat's more, some of the light that passes through or bounces off the world's atmosphere might even be sampled for indirect signs of life. Such gases might include methane, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and perhaps 14,000 other so-called biosignatures.\n\nRed dwarf stars typically blast out a lot of flares and solar storms, which can harm or destroy planetary atmospheres. They're also very bright in ultraviolet light, which can break down biosignatures. But Seager said Barnard's star, as an M dwarf, is calmer and gives off less UV light \u2014 so its presumable planet may be able to accumulate biosignatures to detectable levels.\n\nBut even if Barnard's star b is a bust for biosignatures, observations may find that it isn't alone.\n\n\"I don't discard the possibility of smaller Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of Barnard's star,\" M\u00e9ndez said. \"Now we know that Barnard has planets, and there is plenty of space between the star and this new planet for a few small ones.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly described Ganymede as a moon of Saturn; it's a moon of Jupiter. We actually meant to describe Enceladus, which is a moon of Saturn, and regret the error."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Sponsor Post", "title": "5 simple ways to transform your financial life", "description": "Managing money isn\u2019t taught in school.

It's just assumed that everyone will figure out the best way to save, spend, and invest once they start earning a real income. But it's not easy, especially as bills and obligations pile up.\n\nThe good news is there are plenty of ways to make your finances less complicated. By taking advantage of some basic money tools and tactics, you can ease the burden.\n\nSo if you find that managing your income and expenses takes up too much time, here are five quick and easy steps to simplify your financial life today.\n\nCut up that phone contract\n\nOne of the longest financial commitments that young adults make is a wireless-phone contract. The trouble is, when job circumstances change or you lose your phone, you get stuck in an expensive contract when you can least afford it.\n\nA smarter way to manage communication costs is to opt for a no-contract wireless plan. For example, SIMPLE Mobile offers 30-day service plans with no contracts starting at $25 a month, plus taxes and fees.\n\nThat means more speed, more data, and more flexibility for less money.\n\nAutomate your budget\n\nTechnology can be a huge help when it comes to managing your finances, and one of the most popular things to do is to automate your bill payments and budgeting.\n\nFor recurring bills, such as rent, gas, and electricity, arrange for providers to charge a credit card or deduct the money from a bank account. This will help avoid any late-payment charges and save time logging in to settle accounts each month.\n\nThen, use a budgeting app like Mint or Wally to automatically download those bill payments and other transactions from your bank accounts. These apps make it easy to access to your budget on the go and ensure it's always up to date.\n\nSimplify your money goals\n\nWhether you want to pay off your student loans, buy a sports car, or travel the world, focusing on one single goal can help you get there faster.\n\nHaving a firm target will help you feel more in control of your money and resist the temptation to overindulge when the opportunity arises. Plus, you'll already be doing better than most people \u2014 just 34% of Americans set specific financial goals in 2017.\n\nSo instead of spreading your money thin chasing several financial goals this year, consider setting one goal to focus your efforts.\n\nCut back to one credit card\n\nOne of the fastest ways to simplify your finances is getting your wallet down to just one credit card.\n\nThis makes it much easier to review each statement. If you have two or three cards, you're much less likely to go through each and every charge to check for errors. One statement makes that an easier process, saving time and money.\n\nA single credit card also means a single debt balance, which can help focus repayment efforts and get you back in the black sooner.\n\nStart a rainy-day fund\n\nFinancial experts recommend that everyone have a rainy-day fund for when life throws a financial curveball. But so few people actually do it.\n\nA simple way to start saving some money to cover unexpected expenses is to automate your savings. Open a savings account separate from your everyday account, and arrange for a fixed amount to be automatically transferred into it each month.\n\nThis will help ensure that you have something to fall back on if you ever need it.\n\nFind out more about how SIMPLE Mobile can help you make the right financial decisions.\n\nDisclaimer: Please always refer to the latest Terms and Conditions of Service at SimpleMobile.com.

Like any characteristic, it exists on a spectrum. We all fall somewhere along the narcissism continuum. In fact, a certain amount of self-centeredness is healthy. Research shows that it contributes to confidence, resilience, and ambition.\n\nHowever, any personality trait taken to an extreme can become pathological. A person who is excessively high in narcissism is said to have narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), which is a diagnosable mental illness.\n\nA person with narcissistic traits may be mildly self-centered at times, but NPD, on the other hand, is a deeply ingrained, pervasive pattern. These people have an extremely fragile sense of self-esteem (masked by an inflated sense of superiority) to the point where it interferes with normal functioning across a wide range of settings beyond work. Studies show that this may be due in part to brain differences. People with NPD often have less brain matter in areas related to empathy.\n\nRelated:How to know if you or someone you know is a narcissist, according to a clinical psychologist\n\nDifficult or disordered\n\nIn other words, there's a difference between working with someone who has narcissistic personality disorder and working for someone who has higher than normal narcissistic traits.\n\nWith the recent rise in narcissism and popularity of the topic, I've also noticed an increased interest in self-diagnosing the difficult people in our lives and careers. Although narcissistic personality disorder is very uncommon (between 0.5-1% of the general population or one in every one hundred people), it seems like everyone now claims to have a narcissist in their lives, especially at work where relationships can get the most heated.\n\nChalking up what you dislike about another person to a mental disorder isn't ethical or fair. You may say things like, \"my boss is absolutely crazy\" or \"she's a raving narcissist\" off the cuff and out of anger, but pathologizing people in this way can be very dangerous. Labeling someone with a psychiatric disorder not only further stigmatizes those who do live with mental health diagnoses, but it also trivializes how serious narcissistic personality disorder can be.\n\nSpotting a real narcissist\n\nBefore you jump to self-diagnosing your boss or co-worker as a narcissist, it's important to understand what differentiates narcissistic traits from full-blown NPD.\n\nSpotting narcissistic personality disorder in the workplace is crucial because it can be very damaging. For example, because they have trouble taking criticism, research suggests that people with NPD are responsible for more work-related lawsuits. Narcissists are also drawn to power, which helps them rise to leadership roles, but their penchant for unethical behavior, need for admiration, and lack of empathy can kill morale and destroy an organization.\n\nRelated:The opposite of a narcissist is an 'empath' \u2014 here are the signs you could be one\n\nSo, how can you tell when narcissistic traits tip over to NPD?

It will be the Russian-made Soyuz-FG's first crewed flight since Oct. 11, when U.S. astronaut Nick Hague and a Russian cosmonaut landed unharmed on the Kazakh desert steppe after the rocket bound for the International Space Station failed in mid-air two minutes after liftoff.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration has relied on Russian rockets to ferry astronauts to the space station since the United States retired its Space Shuttle program in 2011, though the agency has announced plans for test flights carrying two astronauts on commercial rockets made by Boeing and SpaceX next April.\n\n\"I do see the incident that happened on Oct. 11 with our launch abort not as a failure but as a success,\" McClain told Reuters in a telephone interview from Russia. \"It actually bolsters my confidence in the rocket and in the processes that we have.\n\n\"We're confident in the vehicle and getting back to it,\" McClain said of the Soyuz rocket, which she called \"the workhorse of the space program.\"\n\nAfter lifting off from Kazakhstan's Soviet-era cosmodrome of Baikonur last month, a damaged sensor caused one of the rocket's three booster stages to separate improperly, falling inward on the rocket and jolting it off its ascent two miles above ground, Russian investigators announced earlier this month.\n\nVideo from inside the capsule showed the two men being shaken around at the moment the failure occurred, their arms and legs flailing. Russian cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin can be heard saying, \"That was a quick flight.\"\n\nThe accident was the first serious launch problem experienced by a crewed Soyuz space mission since 1983, when a crew narrowly escaped before a launchpad explosion.\n\nIn August, a hole appeared in a Soyuz capsule docked to the ISS that caused a brief loss of air pressure and had to be patched. Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, has said that it could have been made deliberately by someone during manufacturing or while the craft was in space.\n\nMcClain and two other crewmates will launch from the same launchpad in Baikonur, joining the space station's current three-person crew.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Orlando, Florida; Editing by Ben Klayman and Leslie Adler)"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ethel Jiang", "title": "Apple's waning iPhone demand means the big jump in prices won't be enough, analyst says (AAPL)", "description": "Apple 's iPhone revenue grew 18% in 2018, as a higher average selling price offset flat unit growth.

It's your girl Jackie Aina. Thank you so much for joining me on today's video.\n\n[Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie...]\n\nI would go to makeup counters and one, they'd be frantic. \"Oh my God, the black girl's here. What do we do?\" Or they would just like, \"Oh no, we don't have anything for you.\" Or \"I wouldn't do that on your complexion.\" It was always like being the other. I always felt like I was an 'other' box at the makeup counter.\n\nAnd it was so annoying and so frustrating that I was like, \"You know what, I'm just gonna do this stuff myself and then I'll just show people how to do it on YouTube.\" I'm gonna apply that just directly on my eyelid.\n\nPeople were like \"Oh my god, like who's this black girl? This dark-skinned girl, like she wears color, she wears nude lips, she wears all the trends that we never see on people that look like us,\" you know.\n\nMaybe everyone's gonna have a different opinion on this, but you have to get to where you wanna be first before you can really shake the table, right? So I would talk about it, I was very vocal, but also very mindful. I still wanna have a relationship with brands. I still wanna grow my platform. And the day that I get untouchable basically is when you'll really hear it from me. That's when I will really like use my platform in the way that I really want to, you know.\n\n[Just don't appreciate the blatant erasure of like a whole spectrum of people. Like it doesn't even look like they tried.]\n\nI believe if you're gonna for example, critique brands or you know, talk about the negatives, I think you should also be uplifting black-owned businesses, you know, talking about other minority-owned businesses, you know.\n\n[I'm going to be doing a full face using Muslim-owned beauty brands.]\n\nTo me it's like, I have to kinda sandwich the positive with the negative because ultimately that's the goal is to have more people in positions that look like me, you know, filling seats, working for brands, becoming influencers themselves, being voices that need to be heard, starting businesses.\n\nI don't want to call out everything. I don't feel like I need to be the attack dog of every single incident that takes place online, you know. It's also something that a lot of black women can relate to because people look to us to kind of be like the savior of everything, and it's like this isn't something that we can carry on our backs all the time. Like, we need to collectively as a community, be able to say \"Look, this is not okay, this is wrong.\"\n\nWith respect to the conversation of diversity, this is what's so ironic about the topic now because a lot of people like to say that I kind of talk about diversity as like a marketing ploy, and I'm like, if you only knew, five, even six, not that long ago, I was the one that was being told \"Don't talk about that, it's too niche, it's too specific, white people can't relate to that. Lighter people can't relate to that. Asian people can't relate to that.\" These are things that brands will tell me. I was turned down by management companies because they wouldn't want to take on my brand, because they just didn't see the vision. They just didn't see the vision. It's like, \"what's with this diversity thing?\" like you know.\n\n[Today we're going to be talking about my favorite foundation line for women of color.]\n\nOf course there's more to talk about than just that. That's not the only thing that my platform is about, but the struggles of colorism don't just affect the black community. They affect the Latin community. They affect Asian communities. They affect Natives. It's something that a lot of people can relate to, as it relates to makeup. Mind you, this is still a makeup channel. So it's like, you know, even though you don't wear the same foundation as me. It doesn't mean you can't enjoy my videos.\n\n[You can handle the dew. Like I don't think I'm ready for this jelly. Now it does, however.]\n\nIt's crazy seeing now the people that look like me are finally getting a chance to break those glass ceilings and actually grow past a certain number on YouTube. Whereas five years ago, it was not happening. I think that a lot of the work and vocalizing that people of color have done on YouTube and social media in general, like I see viral tweets on Twitter all the time of people being like \"This is unacceptable\" from these brands, you know with these foundation shade ranges, and just their diversity and their brands in general.\n\nAll it takes is one Instagram post for a brand to show their new launch, and God forbid it doesn't run darker than like, you know, tan. People will come for them. And brands see that and they've come to understand \"Like, okay, we can't we can't let this slide anymore. We need to make more people visible.\" And I'm not even just talking about as it relates to color. I mean this could also relate to having Muslims in your campaign. You know, I love what Fenty did with having you know, women actually in hijabs in their campaigns. Seeing someone that looks like you is powerful. That to me is a direct reflection of like I'm accepted, I am beautiful. I'm worthy of being seen.\n\nI actually got reached out by Jerrod Blandino, who at the time was the owner of Too Faced, 'cause now it's an Estee brand. He sat me down in a office with like all his team. And basically was like, \"We have not been doing very good justice to a particular community with our foundations and we want you to expand the Born This Way line and like be the face of it.\" And I was like \"Wow.\" At that time, no one had ever done a campaign like that. You know, it really took me aback because I think it also reminded me of those earlier days in my career of hearing that \"This diversity thing is going to get you nowhere.\" And so it was kind of like a full circle moment for me.\n\n[It's finally here. Oh my god.]\n\nAnd I'm so glad that now the conversation has gone from \"Ugh don't talk about that diversity thing anymore,\" to now like, everybody's stepping it up."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Antonio Villas-Boas", "title": "Google's impressive 'Night Sight' camera feature rolls out today \u2014 here's how it works (GOOG, GOOGL)", "description": "Google's \"Night Sight\" feature for its Pixel smartphone cameras rolls out on Wednesday.

He added that even two of the top performing equities shops, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, wouldn't beef up bonus pools by 20% \"in their wildest dreams.\"\n\nWhat gives?\n\nVolatility jolted back to life in 2018 and equities revenues have surged, totalling $34.6 billion through the first three quarters at the top global firms, according to Bloomberg data. That's a 16% increase from the $29.7 billion over the same period in 2017, and a 14% increase from the $30.4 billion reported in the same period in 2016.\n\nBut there are some caveats to the healthy surface level figures, as the gains weren't evenly spread across banks or equities product lines.\n\nIn earnings calls this year, many banks have called out performance from their derivatives and prime finance teams.\n\nSome stock trading operations made a killing on the volatility spike in February \u2014 especially derivatives teams that were positioned to capitalize on the CBOE Volatility Index spike \u2014 as well as from subsequent bouts of market turmoil in March and more recently.\n\nHedge funds have also been active, so the business of providing them with loans and other services, known as prime brokerage, has been robust as well.\n\nElectronic or algorithmic stock trading has also done well, but that's a commoditized business, McCormack noted, and inherently involves less staff in favor of machines and lines of code.\n\nRead more: Equity traders are crushing it as big banks celebrate a huge six months\n\nThe gains in traditional stock trading for clients via humans, known as cash equities, have been more measured. That business was up 7% through the first half of the year at the 12 largest firms, compared with 35% for derivatives and 17% for prime, according to the most current data from industry consultant Coalition.\n\nThis more human-intensive and less sexy equities business line has in recent years been overlooked and underinvested in, which McCormack says has been mistake.\n\n\"Most banks have made 'cash' their red headed step child, which is unfortunate and a mistake as all these high margin businesses - derivs, prime, electronic - only work with a 'cash' engine,\" he said in the post, adding that that if \"your client franchise isn't strong, the other stuff doesn't perform.\"\n\nSome traders will see 20% bumps come bonus time \u2014 some even 50%, McCormack said. But that will be highly individualized and specific, rather than a rising tide across the field. For every trader pulling in $1.5 million \u2014 the outlier \u2014 there are hundreds that will draw $450,000.\n\n\"I believe most people will be disappointed in comp, meaning it will be flat,\" McCormack wrote. \"Flat is the new up, equities will subsidize other business areas this year and that's the nature of the beast.\"\n\nThe only area where compensation will be in a \"different zip code\" is derivatives, and even then \"not everyone will benefit.\"\n\nAnd of course, derivatives has been one of the hottest hiring sectors of the year. Many of the star traders who brought in tens of millions in profits during the VIX spike parlayed that performance into a job at a new firm\u2014 meaning they likely would have already been well-compensated for the healthy bonus they sacrificed by leaving.\n\nSee also:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alex Lockie", "title": "Trump is fuming angry over the midterms and has ditched several outings honoring veterans", "description": "President Donald Trump has ditched a number of planned activities and exhibited intense spurts of anger since his party lost seats in the midterms.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nThe Surface Pro 6 in laptop mode. Best Buy\n\nMicrosoft has been slowly but surely building itself up as a serious competitor in the PC hardware business, and so far, it's been doing a pretty great job. Recent products include the likes of the Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, which we recently reviewed, as well as the Microsoft Surface Go, which we recently tested as well.\n\nIt all started, however, with the original Microsoft Surface Pro, which was arguably the first product that showed the world Microsoft could truly compete in hardware. These days, Microsoft is up to the Surface Pro 6, the latest and greatest in the Surface Pro line. But does the new Surface Pro 6 live up to the Surface Pro name? We put it to the test to find out.\n\nAs with any new product, the first thing you'll notice about the new Surface Pro is its design, and it's a great-looking device \u2014 but not all that different-looking compared to previous iterations of the Surface Pro. In fact, if you put the Surface Pro 6 next to the Surface Pro 5, or even the Surface Pro 4, you'd be hard-pressed telling them apart \u2014 save for the fact that this time around there's a Matte Black color option.\n\nOn the front of the device, you'll find the 12.3-inch touchscreen, along with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with support for Windows Hello. On the left side, there's a headphone jack, while the right side is where you'll find the full-sized USB port, mini DisplayPort, and Surface Connect charging port. On the top, there's the power button and volume rocker. Then, on the back, there's the kickstand. Despite what it may look like in photos, the kickstand is very sturdy and infinitely adjustable \u2014 so you don't have to live with using the device in one of two positions, like when you use the iPad with Apple's keyboard covers. Like other tablet kickstand-style devices, the Surface Pro 6 isn't overly comfortable to use like a laptop with the Type Cover on your lap \u2014 so if you intend on buying the Type Cover, we recommend sticking with a table of some kind.\n\nThe Surface Pro 6 in studio mode. Microsoft\n\nThe only thing we might have changed about the Surface Pro 6 design is that it would have been nice to include a USB-C port or two.\n\nApple has run full-force into adopting USB-C\u2014 causing some outrage. We get that Microsoft is positioning itself as a kind of anti-Apple by not forcing users to adopt dongles for older accessories, but USB-C is still the future, and not adding a USB-C port immediately dates the Surface Pro 6.\n\nAs mentioned, the display on the Surface Pro 6 comes in at 12.3-inches, and it has a resolution of 2,736 x 1,824 \u2014 and it's beautiful. Sure, it's pretty much the same as the display on last year's Surface Pro 5, but that doesn't take away from the fact that colors were vibrant and bright, making the Surface Pro 6 a great choice for those who appreciate a great display. The display is excellent when it comes to touch features too. We found it to be accurate and responsive to touch, and while you might want to use the Surface Pro Type Cover for some situations \u2014 like writing tech reviews \u2014 many will find using the on-screen keyboard and touch controls perfectly adequate for what they need this device for.\n\nUnder the hood, the Surface Pro 6 is an impressive beast for the form factor that it takes.\n\nThe base model includes an 8th-gen Intel Core i5 processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. From there, options range up to an Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM and a full 1TB of storage. Of course, with those specs you'll have to pay $2,299, but it's an option if you want it.\n\nWe found that our model, which was the base model with a 256GB hard drive, was more than capable enough of handling any day-to-day tasks and could get us through a full day of work, plus some video-watching and other entertainment, perfectly fine. Of course, if you expect to use the Surface Pro 6 for more intensive tasks, like any video or audio editing, then it's worth upgrading.\n\nBeyond shelling out the cash for the tablet itself, there's some extra money you might want to spend \u2014 on the Microsoft Type Cover, which comes at $130, and the Microsoft Surface Pen, which costs $100. Those are expensive accessories. Sure, they're not quite as pricey as Apple's options, but they're expensive nonetheless.\n\nThe Surface Pro 6 in tablet mode. Microsoft\n\nNow, this isn't a review of the Surface Pro's accessories, but we can offer a few details.\n\nIn general, we found the Surface Pro 6's Type Cover to offer a nice, tactile typing experience \u2014 which was perfect for longer typing sessions. The touchpad was also nice, and while it could have been a bit larger, it worked perfectly fine. The Type Cover is only available in black if you want to pay the $130, though if you're willing to shell out $160 you can get a Platinum, Cobalt Blue, or Burgundy model too.\n\nThe Surface Pro Pen is pretty nice too. Now, take this with a grain of salt considering the fact that this tech reviewer isn't much of an artist, but the Surface Pro Pen generally felt nice and reacted well to our strokes. It has 4,096 levels of pressure, which is nice, though it would have been nice if it had a little more gesture control, like the new second-generation Apple Pencil.\n\nUltimately, the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is an excellent device and a great option for Windows fans who want to continue their experience in a more portable and tactile format. We do recommend the Type Cover to those who type a lot, but if you don't then you may not need to factor it into the cost.\n\nBut the question remains \u2014 is there a better option in this price range?\n\nWell, that depends.\n\nFor Windows 10 fans, the Surface Pro line is still the best way to experience the hybrid tablet design that has taken off over the past few years, but we still wish Microsoft would update the design a little, even if just to include more modern ports.\n\nFor those not married to Windows 10 and who don't mind using a mobile operating system, the new iPad Pro range is definitely something to consider, especially given the fact that it has a USB-C port and arguably better stylus. iPad aside, however, there's still nothing that can truly challenge the Surface Pro 6 in this segment \u2014 so if you like Windows 10, and want a hybrid, this is the way to go.\n\nBuy the Microsoft Surface Pro 6, starting at $899, available at Microsoft and Best Buy\n\nBuy the Microsoft Surface Pen, $99.99, available Microsoft and Best Buy\n\nBuy the Microsoft Surface Pro Type Cover, $129.99, available at Microsoft and Best Buy"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Caitlin Foster", "title": "Bored on the border: The military's 'border support' mission is killing troop morale", "description": "The military's border support mission is expected to involve over 7,000 active-duty troops from across the country.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nMen's ThermoBall Eco Hoodie in TNF Yellow, $220. The North Face\n\nIf you haven't heard, The North Face is going \"green\" with ThermoBall \u2014 one of the company's largest lines.\n\nThermoBall is the line that hosts much of the company's famously lightweight, super warm outdoors gear, but the first product to actually go eco-friendly is the ThermoBall jacket ($199-$220)\u2014 an award-winning lightweight down-alternative coat.\n\nIf the name ThermoBall sounds familiar, it's because the line gained a lot of fanfare for its synthetic insulation. The round synthetic fiber clusters trap heat within small air pockets like down. This way, you get both the lightweight warmth and compressibility of down jackets with the wet-weather performance of synthetics. According to the company, Kansas State University showed the ThermoBall has the warmth equivalent to 600 fill goose down.\n\nThe ThermoBall Eco jacket is essentially the same as the original, except that it's made from recycled polyester fabric and recycled Primaloft insulation made from plastic bottles diverted from landfills. And, like all gear from The North Face, it comes with a generous lifetime guarantee.\n\nAs of November 2018, ThermoBall Eco can be picked up in stores and online, though not yet at outdoor retailers like REI. You can find it on the site right now for both women and men, in either an adult hoodie or full-zip version in six colors.\n\nWomen's ThermoBall Eco Jacket in Hyper Blue, $199. The North Face\n\nThe recycling trend is one we're glad to see. Since nothing new is really as eco-friendly as not-new materials, recycled fabrics are a great compromise \u2014 they allow for innovative new styles with less toll on the environment, and, eventually, on us. Companies like Everlane, with its recycled outerwear, Girlfriend Collective, with leggings made from fishing nets, and Reformation, now offering a 70% recycled cashmere line, are just a few other examples. It's a particularly popular trend in the outdoor industry, calling to mind REI and Patagonia's many eco-initiatives and newcomers with strong social missions like Cotopaxi.\n\nThe North Face says it already offsets the environmental impact of shipping to its customers around the world, but reintroducing one of their most popular lines in recycled materials will pack more of a punch. The North Face estimates that material production and manufacturing \u2014 in other words, the making of their clothes \u2014 accounts for 60-80% of the company's total environmental impact. It's a natural next step for any company attempting sustainable change at scale.\n\nAnd it's not really new. The North Face started using recycled fibers across core products like the ever-popular Denali jackets as early as 1996, as well as in its Reaxion and Glacier lines. In 2018, it launched an entire Bottle Source collection made from plastic bottles cleaned out of national parks.\n\nThe new ThermoBall Eco is just its latest step towards phasing in recycled materials to its production line. And it's a good choice \u2014 the ThermoBall garnered such fanfare before for its no-compromise mix of the warmth and compactness of down and the all-weather wearability of synthetics, and while the company (and supporters of more eco-friendly practices) hopes the new Eco version will do well this winter, it's probably how good the jacket is that'll drive people to pick the ThermoBall. A smaller environmental impact is just a big bonus."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Scott Davis", "title": "The Warriors are suddenly imploding in spectacular fashion", "description": "Kevin Durant and Draymond Green's on-court spat on Monday has become a potentially franchise-altering incident for the Golden State Warriors.

As the Warriors returned to the bench to prepare for overtime, Kevin Durant clapped angrily at Green, yelling at him to get him the ball for the final shot.\n\nOnce on the bench, Green appeared to berate Durant, and teammates stepped in-between them as Green shouted at Durant throughout the break. The Warriors would go on to lose in overtime.\n\nAfter the game, reports indicated that things were worse than they appeared. ESPN reported that the dispute carried over into the locker room in one of the most intense exchanges of the Warriors dynasty. The Athletic later reported that the exchange included Green making an over-the-line comment about Durant's impending free agency. ESPN reported on Tuesday that despite the intense exchange in the locker room, it never threatened to get physical.\n\nRead more:Kevin Durant and Draymond Green's spat reportedly carried over into an intense locker-room dispute that centered on Durant's impending free agency\n\nAfter details leaked out, the Warriors suspended Green for their Tuesday game against the Atlanta Hawks, which they won, 110-103.\n\nTeammates fight and argue all the time, but from the sounds of it, this has the potential to be a franchise-altering dispute.\n\nThe Athletic's Marcus Thompson divulged more details on Wednesday, reporting that after Durant told Green to get him the ball on Monday, Green went off on Durant. According to Thomspon, Green repeatedly called Durant a \"b----\" and then attacked Durant for how he's handled his impending free agency, leaving the door open to the idea that he might leave after the season.\n\nVia Thompson:\n\n\"According to multiple sources, Green then went on to make it clear he's been making plays for years. He reminded Durant the Warriors were winning before Durant showed up so he wouldn't stand for Durant talking to him as if he were a scrub. Green accused Durant of making the whole season about him even though he was going to leave after this season. Green let out his frustrations about how Durant has handled free agency \u2014 keeping his options open and keeping the story alive, consuming the Warriors and their season with talk of what Durant will do next.\"\n\nEarlier in the season, Durant told The Los Angeles Times' Dan Woike that he felt free agency was a topic that was off-limits, even among teammates.\n\n\"That's business. We don't get into anyone else's business,\" Durant told Woike. \"There's money involved in that stuff. Everything is involved, your life is involved, free agency, a new contract. I don't think guys overstep those boundaries when it comes to that. We don't even play around about that because we're so locked in on the season.\"\n\nAccording to Thompson, Green expected to be punished for his actions but didn't expect a suspension, which cost him over $120,000. Green and head coach Steve Kerr infamously got into a heated dispute that required both men to be separated in 2016, and Green was only fined. Green thought that dispute was worse than Monday night's with Durant, according to Thompson.\n\nThompson also reported that while many people on the Warriors thought Green's tirade went too far, some even thought there was some truth in his criticism's of Durant. Thompson reported that Green spoke with Kerr and Warriors GM Bob Myers after the dispute and reiterated his stance that Durant's free agency has become a distraction. Stephen Curry also reportedly met with Green after the incident and Green told Curry the same thing.\n\nAfter Tuesday's game, Durant was tight-lipped about the situation. When asked if he and Green had made up, he said, \"Nah.\" When asked if Green had crossed a line, Durant said he would keep things \"in-house\" and said he was sure he and Green would make up at some point, citing the long season ahead.\n\nThe Warriors will rebound from the incident. They remain the most talented team by a long stretch, and they've shown this year that they all have a new comfort level on the court.\n\nBut as Thompson noted, there are ramifications to everything that unfolded. Green and Durant will make amends, but it's worth wondering how much Green's words will linger with Durant.\n\nMeanwhile, management took the side of Durant by suspending Green. Green is two years away from free agency, and it's possible that the issue could affect his feelings for the team, even though he has said he wants to re-sign with the Warriors.\n\nThe Warriors also have to protect against a scenario where both Durant and Green want out. Trading Durant would probably be a non-starter for the Warriors unless they're sure Durant is leaving at the end of the season. But what if keeping Durant hinges on his relationship with Green? The Warriors could theoretically be backed into a corner, but that's only if the issue lingers.\n\nThe Warriors' win-loss record likely won't be affected by this issue, but even some insiders wonder if it's something that could eat at the team. Thompson reported that some players already suspected Durant was leaving after the season. Durant's departure would break up this Warriors dynasty and knock them down a peg. If they fail to win the championship this year, this spat could prove to be a pivotal moment in the team's history."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Peter Sarnoff", "title": "A new web-based AR platform looks promising for retailers", "description": "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Increased tolerance for risk is also thought to be behind banks' decision to reduce covenant quality on loans. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of Australia have all previously sounded the alarm on the decreasing quality of leveraged lending.\n\nThe data also suggests that loan demand is falling citing increases in customers internally generated funds, reduced investment, and customers shifting their borrowing to new lenders as reasons for the slowdown.\n\nAccording to the Fed's survey: \"[Banks are] reportedly narrowing loan rate spreads on C&I loans to firms of all sizes.

It forgoes any advertising, e-commerce, and celebrity endorsements. It rarely grants interviews and very occasionally makes products available to the mass market.\n\nTurns out, a lips-are-sealed tactic is the best way to build buzz.\n\n\"Luxury is a dream, and revealing too much of what goes on behind the scenes would spoil the magic,\" a representative for the House of Goyard told Hypebeast last year, adding: \"We believe that whispering softly in someone's ears is not only more elegant, but also much more efficient than screaming at the top of one's lungs.\"\n\nIts mystery demands desire. Everyone loves a sense of exclusivity, and what's more exclusive than a brand whose heritage and allure is based on discretion, garnering business solely through word of mouth of its influential clients?\n\nAs Sarah Young of the Independent writes of Goyard's anti-spotlight stance: \"Those who know, know. For them, it's all about attracting the people who count.\"\n\nAfter all, high-end brands risk losing their luster and jeopardizing their exclusivity if they fall into the everyday hands of mass consumption. Goyard's under-the-radar reputation is the pinnacle of ultimate indulgence for its buyers.\n\nRich and famous clientele\n\nThe coveted chevron-printed canvas and leather luggage has been seen accompanying everyone from the newly named Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, to the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, to the Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse, who has a custom trunk for his cutlery.\n\nGoyard is also increasingly popular among hip-hop's elite. The rapper A$AP Rocky wore a Goyard messenger bag to the 2016 Grammy Awards, and Kanye West sported a Goyard briefcase during Paris Fashion Week in 2009.\n\nAnd the apple doesn't fall far from the tree \u2014 West's daughter North was spotted in Los Angeles in February with a personalized Goyard St. Louis bag, costing roughly $1,460 after customization. Meanwhile, her aunt Khloe Kardashian jetted to Tokyo with her belongings packed in not one but two customized Goyard bags.\n\nThey're part of an impressive list of clients including Coco Chanel, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Jacques Cartier, Pablo Picasso, Karl Lagerfeld, and the Duchess of Windsor, who collected many Goyard pieces, such as pet accessories and a trunk to accommodate 150 pairs of shoes.\n\nGoyard's owner, Jean-Michel Signoles, purchased much of the duke and duchess' collection when Sotheby's auctioned off the contents of their Paris home in 1997. A document case and monogrammed trunk went for nearly $15,000, while another lot sold for $32,500, Town & Country reported.\n\nThat's nothing compared to one of Goyard's 19th-century-style trunks that fetches $59,315, according to the Business of Fashion. The Palace trunk costs $10,120, with additional customization beginning at $165.\n\nBut not all its prices are so far-fetched for such an exclusive brand, such as the entry-level $300 Saint Sulpice cardholder or the $2,430 Grand Bleu messenger bag. A classic Goyard tote costs $1,150, while a comparable Louis Vuitton is $1,810.\n\nIt's 'all about traveling, distant horizons, escapism'\n\nGoyard's focus on artisanal craftsmanship prevents it from churning out the bountiful merchandise that Louis Vuitton does, arguably helping Goyard hold a higher level of quality and prestige compared with its competitor.\n\nAnd because it's like an heirloom, the brand holds resale value, Rati Sahi Levesque, the chief merchant of the luxury-resale site The Real Real, told Racked.\n\n\"It's an insider's bag,\" Levesque said, \"but it doesn't scream luxury.\"\n\nGoyard's serious collectors prefer individual, custom pieces over the brand's more discernible items, such as the St. Louis tote and or the Saigon handbag.\n\nEvery order \"is the result of a very close creative collaboration between a customer and the Goyard team,\" and the limits are endless, Goyard told Town & Country.\n\nEver authentic, though, the company leaves special orders up to its discretion, eschewing any requests that aren't considered on brand \u2014 even if it's from a recognizable name.\n\n\"We turned down several orders for custom trunks for giant TV screens, for instance,\" the fashion house told Town & Country. \"Goyard is all about traveling, distant horizons, escapism, so a TV trunk by Goyard really sounded like an oxymoron.\"\n\nA bespoke gardening trunk, on the other hand, was deemed whimsical, timeless, practical, and functional \u2014 something that \"truly captures the essence of Goyard.\" Commissioned in 2015, it cost roughly $15,000.\n\nThe brand is so elusive that even historic special orders aren't known to the company.\n\n\"Finding a rare trunk is an extremely complicated hunt, requiring near private investigator's skills ... and a lot of patience,\" a Goyard representative told Town & Country.\n\nAs Deborah Soss, Bergdorf Goodman's vice president of accessories and handbags, told Racked, \"I think there is always an allure to a bit of mystery.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Mary Hanbury", "title": "Bloomingdale's is moving in on Sears' home turf (M)", "description": "Macy's- owned Bloomingdale's is partnering with LG Electronics to open a new store-in-store selling major appliances and TVs at its flagship location in New York.

Only Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and a small handful of administrators were in on the ruse \u2014 the rest of the jail's workforce was told the show was a documentary about jails on the US-Mexico border.\n\nEach of the undercover inmates was tasked with finding out information about a specific aspect of life in jail, including gang life, drug culture, and jail operations. They reported their findings to Lamb at the end of their two-month stint.\n\nPrevious seasons of \"60 Days In\" took place at Atlanta's Fulton County Jail and southern Indiana's Clark County Jail. Lamb said he wanted to bring the program to his Arizona jail in an effort to increase transparency and show people what life behind bars is really like.\n\n\"When this opportunity presented itself, we saw an opportunity to really get an inside look at our facility, and show the people of our county as well what kind of facility we run, and be able to try and address issues that we thought we were having in the facility,\" Lamb told Business Insider.\n\nThroughout the course of the show, the participants are exposed to rampant violence, racism, drug use, and harassment from other inmates.\n\n\"Being in jail is a nightmare. It is just hell,\" one of the undercover volunteers, a real estate agent named Brooke, told Business Insider. \"I think people that are out doing crimes, they don't know what they're signing up for.\"\n\nA group of inmates at Pinal County Adult Detention Center in Florence, Arizona. A&E\n\nIn the men's section of the jail, the volunteers were shocked to learn how big a role race played in everyday life. Within moments of arriving in their units, the volunteers were greeted by members of their respective races, who explained to them where members of each race slept, ate, and used the bathroom.\n\n\"The politics of jail is you stick with your own kind,\" a participant named Abner, a chaplain from New York, said on the show. \"You have to follow your race, your people, and the rules.\"\n\nIn one early episode, the inmates learned that even haircuts are rife with racial tension. When Abner, who is Latino, tried to use the jail-issued hair clippers, he was brusquely informed that white inmates get their hair cut first.\n\n\"I know in my mind this is about power and control,\" he said.\n\nDrug use is another frequent topic of concern on the show. Several participants reported that inmates at the Pinal County jail would frequently smuggle drugs inside their body cavities, while other inmates resorted to unusual and dangerous homemade drugs.\n\n\"One woman, she was in a cell a few doors down, she was literally snorting coffee grounds to try to get a high,\" Brooke told Business Insider.\n\nLamb said after filming wrapped up, a number of changes were made based on the information he got from the undercover participants. For example, one of the volunteers clued him in to a scheme some of the inmates were using to pass notes, or \"kites,\" from one section of the jail to the other.\n\nAccording to Lamb, the inmates would sneak the notes in between trays of food, which would then be delivered to other units by trustees, the group of inmates who distribute food and perform other tasks. Lamb said the inmates knew they could get away with it because they had studied the \"methodical\" way guards would stack the trays.\n\n\"A lot of these people, they're very intelligent, and they have nothing else to do all day but try to figure this out, try to get one over on us,\" Lamb told Business Insider. \"And they're very good at it.

It costs a mere $330, and it offers nearly all of the same high-end specs and features as the top-of-the-line iPad Pros.\n\nIf you own an aging iPad or iPad Mini, the new 9.7-inch iPad is an excellent upgrade. Obviously, if you have an iPad Air 2 or an iPad Pro, you don't need to get the new one. The 2018 iPad is for anyone who has always wanted an iPad, but couldn't afford the $500+ price tag. It's an absolute steal at $329.99.\n\nThe 9.7-inch screen is sharp and clear with its 2,048 x 1,536-pixel resolution, the A10 processor is very capable (even though it's not the iPhone X's A11 chip), the battery life should be great, and you can even buy things on it with Apple Pay, thanks to the Touch ID fingerprint sensor.\n\nBest of all, it supports the Apple Pencil, an incredible stylus with virtually no lag. You will have to pay $100 extra for the Pencil, but if you like to take notes or draw on your iPad, it is well worth it. Naturally, any Bluetooth keyboard also works with the iPad, so if you want to use it as a quasi-laptop, you can pick up a great keyboard.\n\nYou simply can't beat those specs at that price point. Comparable Android tablets cost hundreds of dollars more, and the iPad still has a better app library and accessory support.\n\nThe aluminum build looks and feels premium, and the 9.7-inch screen size makes it a very portable device that's easy to stow away in your bag. It's quite light, too, so you can happily binge-watch Netflix in bed on your new iPad. Tech nerds will say it's a boring old design, but it's tried and true. Plus, the aluminum build is durable.\n\nPros: Incredible price for an iPad, powerful A10 processor, slick aluminum design, Touch ID for security and Apple Pay, gorgeous screen, supports the Apple Pencil, iOS 11\n\nCons: Not the latest A11 processor found on the iPhone X"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Jonathan Garber", "title": "Canada Goose is going nuts after crushing earnings and raising guidance (GOOS)", "description": "Canada Goose reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street estimates.

Conner was convinced she had encountered the next big thing in wellness while on a recent trip to Mexico: eco-friendly yoga mats and equipment made out of cork.\n\nNine months later, 42 Birds was born.\n\nBut the e-commerce brand, which sells its products on its website as well as on Amazon, isn't just another direct-to-consumer startup. Conner and Rednor started it \u2014 and incubated it at Decoded, the independent ad agency they run \u2014 because they wanted to understand what exactly it takes to helm a successful DTC brand.\n\n\"We wanted to start out own DTC brand to build our expertise in e-commerce from the ground up,\" Rednor told Business Insider. \"We could pretend to be experts, or build the expertise ourselves. In order to talk the talk, we wanted to walk the walk.\"\n\nDecoded has a unique approach at cracking the DTC trend, but it isn't alone. The cofounders of public relations firm Azione, Leland Drummond and Michele Thomas, are partnering with The Coveteur co-founder Stephanie Mark to launch The League, a new active-intimates DTC brand, next year, based on what they've learned working with DTC brands over the years.\n\nMore broadly, as hundreds of new brands crop up to upend virtually every industry by selling everything from mattresses to makeup directly to consumers using digital media, a new wave of ad agencies is making inroads in an area where traditional ad giants are still finding their way.\n\n\"Big agencies are not equipped to work at the pace and in a manner that matches the needs of a digitally native vertical brand,\" said Mike Cassidy, partner at private equity firm August Spark, which funds small businesses, including e-commerce agency BVAccel. \"You have to be experts at retail, e-commerce, and digital \u2014 which is a specialty few can master.\"\n\nA roster of new agencies have emerged around the needs of digitally native brands\n\nThe DTC revolution has spawned a roster of agencies over the past decade that have positioned themselves around the needs of digitally native brands, from creative and performance marketing to media buying as well as strategic planning and communications.\n\nThese agencies, from Gin Lane and YellowHammer Media to Derris and BVAccel, to name a few, all pride themselves on having a nuanced understanding of the space and personalized ways of working. Many of them work exclusively with DTC brands, but they differ in the ways they approach the space and actually structure their relationships with them.\n\nRead more: A new type of ad agency is catering to brands born on digital channels - and industry giants need a plan\n\nSome are upending traditional fee structures to cater to DTC brands\n\nWhile Decoded has incubated its own DTC brand, others are upending traditional fee structures and retainer agreements to offer more flexibility to DTC brands.\n\nYellowHammer, which specializes in performance marketing, for instance, operates like an extension of its clients' businesses, which include hot-sauce-subscription seller Fuego Box and luxury-sheets retailer Boll & Branch. And instead of traditional retainer fees, the company gets paid on the basis of the brands' growth. So the more sales it drives for its ad partners, the more money it gets.\n\n\"We have managed to create a service infrastructure that really allows us to be a part of their team,\" Sam Appelbaum, YellowHammer's general manager, told Business Insider. \"Direct-to-consumer marketing is essentially outcome-based marketing, and our thesis is that's where all of marketing is eventually going to go.\"\n\nSimilarly, e-commerce agency Diff offers flexibility to its clients, solving for a string of different problems that its clients may be facing depending on the stage of their growth, according to CEO Ben Crudo. And unlike traditional ad giants, these services don't come with a hefty price tag. A budget between $20,000 and $50,000 could get a DTC brand a pretty decent-sized team, he said.\n\nAn early-stage startup that has just finished raising money on Kickstarter, for example, would probably benefit most from a sleek new website that could be put together by pooling in strategy, user experience, and front-end development resources. But a more mature DTC brand may need more help on its back-end operations to improve shipping.\n\n\"Brands are built not just through nifty marketing but also by filling holes that appear in the business,\" Crudo said. \"We solve for the biggest problem at every stage of maturity for a DTC brand, bringing both technical and business savvy and cutting through the red tape.\"\n\nAnd others are offering their services in return for a stake in DTC brands\n\nMeanwhile, firms like PR, branding, and content agency Derris and creative agency Gin Lane, have a different approach and often end up taking a stake in startups in return for helping them craft their business and marketing.\n\nDerris, for example, has been taking a small ownership stake in most of its DTC clients for years. But last year, it also raised a $10 million fund to invest in future clients by launching a separate wing called Amity Supply. So now, the firm invests money into its clients' startups on top of the stake it already gets for its services.\n\n\"Put simply, we needed an economic model like the ownership-stake approach in order to justify working with early-stage brands,\" founder Jesse Derris told Business Insider.\n\nSimilarly, Gin Lane, which works exclusively with DTC brands and has developed creative identities for brands including Hims and AYR, has also started asking for equity in companies like Quip and Smile Direct Club in return for its services. After all, there are downsides to working with these kinds of brands.\n\n\"Working with early-stage businesses that you're trying to get off the ground is very different than working with a large brand \u2014 and it's very difficult to be really good at both,\" Gin Lane CEO Nick Ling said. \"But we'd rather be a sushi knife than a Swiss Army knife and be really good at one thing versus average at everything.\"\n\nLarger agencies aren't taking the threat lying down\n\nDTC brands are fundamentally different from larger, more traditional brands. They are digital natives, own their first-party customer data, and rely heavily on performance marketing on digital channels to scale their businesses.\n\n\"The problem with the ad world is they work from the outside in \u2014 they are looking in on product, trying to get your attention to connect the product to a consumer's ephemeral craving,\" said Gene Liebel, founding partner at Brooklyn, New York-based product design shop Work & Co.\n\nSo DTC brands are increasingly opting for specialist agencies like those previously mentioned rather than larger, bigger ad companies.\n\n\"When we're navigating things for the first time, they're either willing to jump in and figure it out with us, or they've already done it countless times before with other DTC brands,\" said Rithvik Venna, cofounder and chief operating officer at OROS Apparel. \"This is a special skill set that is not so readily available at a more traditional agency.\"\n\n\"In order to grow, we have to constantly do new things hinged on new areas of opportunity while continuing to do what's working efficiently,\" added Jonathan Newcomb, chief marketing officer at eyewear startup Felix Gray. \"That's the reason we look for specialists that are accustomed to the kind of goals we have.\"\n\nThis has started to put bigger ad companies under major pressure. But they aren't taking the threat lying down.\n\nFull-service digital agency Huge, which set up its own coffee shop in Atlanta three years ago to double up as a retail research and development facility, is now working on a new vending machine tied to a DTC offering set to launch in 2019.\n\nAnd media agency R2C has set up its own proprietary software to track its clients' marketing efforts on a cost-per-acquisition basis. It has also established a separate company called Leavened, which offers a platform and tools specifically for DTC companies.\n\n\"DTC brands have a high expectation for accountability of their marketing spend, including offline,\" R2C president and COO Jane Crisan said. \"We have made heavy investments over the last six years to create a suite of proprietary tools designed for this.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ryan Pickrell", "title": "The US could face a 'decisive military defeat' in a war with China or Russia today, an alarming new report warns", "description": "The US is facing its worst national security crisis in decades, according to a new report to Congress from the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission.

Even though people have been saying this for years, only recently have the world's mainstream automakers really taken this to heart. Sure, relatively affordable EVs have been on the road a decade now. But for far too many brands, going electric was more of a strategically prudent way to satisfy increasingly stringent emissions standards than a true commitment to electric mobility.\n\nThings are different now. Tesla can't make enough of its electric cars to keep up with demand. GM and Nissan are fully committed to production EVs. While luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Porsche have all prepared purpose-built EVs set to hit the market in the near future.\n\nAnd then there's Jaguar.\n\nOnce the byword for stodgy British retro luxury, Jag is now all-in on electric. In fact, Jaguar beat out its rivals to become the first mainstream luxury brand to have an EV with enough range to legitimately compete against Tesla.\n\nThe Jaguar I-PACE enters the market in a unique position in that it's the only car in its segment. Including the I-PACE, there are only four luxury EVs on the market and three of them are the Tesla Model S, Model X, and Model 3.\n\nWith the Model X the only other SUV. However, it should be noted that the Model X is a larger, mid-size three-row crossover SUV and doesn't compete directly with I-PACE that is significantly less expensive.\n\nSpecifically, the Jag will be the only electric compact crossover available until the Audi E-Tron, Mercedes-Benz EQ C, and Tesla Model Y hits showrooms.\n\nRecently, Business Insider spent a week with a 2019 Jaguar I-PACE EV400 HSE test car in Corris Gray. The 2019 Jaguar I-PACE starts at $69,500 while the top-spec HSE variant starts at $80,500.

This has led to Live Nation Productions getting on the ground floor for documentaries like \"Can't Stop Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story\" and Netflix's \"Gaga: Five Foot Two.\"\n\nBut what brought the company an instant jolt of clout in Hollywood was Parry jumping on the most recent remake of \"A Star Is Born.\"\n\nParry, who has a thick Rolodex thanks to her years at MTV and decade running Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company, began working her connections back when Clint Eastwood was still attached to direct and Beyonc\u00e9 was in talks to star in the lead role.\n\n\"I was at a barbecue at Joel Silver's house, and Greg Silverman, who was running production at Warner Bros. at the time, was there, and I started talking to him about it,\" Parry told Business Insider. \"I really wanted to see if Live Nation could be involved.\"\n\nWhat Silverman, or really any executive at any studio, didn't realize was how much Live Nation was connected to artists and music fans.\n\nAlong with Live Nation Entertainment owning over 100 music festivals and venues, as well as owning the huge ticket-sales and distribution company Ticketmaster, Live Nation also houses the managers of some of the biggest acts on the planet.\n\n\"Where I sit, on one side of me is the manager of Miley Cyrus and on the other is [the one] who manages Lady Gaga. It's a good place to be sitting,\" Parry said with a laugh.\n\nParry didn't lock things down at the barbecue (Silverman was ousted at Warner Bros. months later), but she wasn't close to giving up.\n\nBradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in \"A Star Is Born.\" Warner Bros. The next few years passed with \"A Star is Born\" still trying to get off the ground, and in that time, Parry began conversations with Bradley Cooper's agent, then Cooper himself (who would eventually star in and direct the movie), as well as more executives at Warner Bros., where she laid out what Live Nation could provide the movie \u2014 posters of the movie at music festivals; the trailer playing before the biggest acts come onstage; dedicated email blasts thanks to Ticketmaster.\n\nThe momentum was building, but what really clinched it, Parry said, was a chance encounter with \"A Star Is Born\" producer Bill Gerber at a party for a Martha Stewart book.\n\nParry said that while everyone gravitated toward Stewart to get her to sign a copy of their book, she was at the other side of the room with Gerber, talking about the movie.\n\n\"Billy came back around after I met with Warner Bros., and he said, 'Let's go,'\" Parry recalled.\n\nLive Nation came on to produce the movie in a hybrid role of putting in financing while also providing unique marketing to promote its release.\n\nRead more: All of the \"A Star Is Born\" movies ranked from worst to best\n\nBy the time Live Nation came onboard, \"A Star Is Born\" was already in production with Lady Gaga as the lead opposite Cooper. So what Parry focused on was how to get the word out to music lovers.\n\nOver the summer, if you went to a well-known concert, you probably saw big \"A Star Is Born\" posters at the venue. And as the trailer became a meme sensation, it also showed in front of thousands at events like Lollapalooza and Country LakeShake.\n\nAnd then Ticketmaster worked its magic.\n\n\"Ticketmaster has something like 180 million emails, so I got them to send me everyone who bought tickets to Gaga's last tour and everyone who is buying her Vegas residency,\" Parry said. \"So when the trailer was sent out, you really targeted her authentic fans. When I worked for Sandler, we dreamt for this kind of data.\"\n\nAnd in tracking down the \"authentic fan,\" Parry didn't stop there. She spread the net to the fans of others in the movie, like those who bought tickets to Dave Chappelle's recent comedy shows. They even targeted Bruno Mars fans.

The firm plans on using the funding to bring its technology to Asia, Europe, and South America, as well as increase hiring. This funding can propel Poynt to the forefront of an increasingly crowded space.\n\nMerchants want value-added offerings from their POS providers. The line between physical and digital commerce is blurring, causing merchants to demand more from their POS providers, such as business management tools or offerings that enable them to serve customers more broadly. Poynt VP of Business Operation and Strategy Rishi Taparia previously told Business Insider Intelligence that in a digital-first world, merchants are shifting from caring about a provider's payment services to considering how that provider's offerings and tools can best help them service customers beyond payments.\n\nThat's caused immense competition in the space. While Poynt offers one of the most robust suites of features on its platform \u2014 with connectivity, diversity of payment methods, an app ecosystem, and unparalleled developer access \u2014 it's largely been eclipsed by bigger players entering the space. Payments technology provider Stripe recently launched Terminal, a product designed for in-store payment acceptance that offers POS hardware, application programming interfaces (APIs), software developer kits (SDKs), and software to manage connected devices. And Square recently launched the Square Terminal, a mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) device that complements its existing suite of POS hardware. Moreover, other major players like Ingenico and PayPal have been diversifying their offerings and building out full-suite solutions to meet the shifting needs of sellers. But despite flying under the radar, Poynt has still been able to see volume as the space becomes increasingly crowded and puts pressure on the firm to expand."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "John Haltiwanger", "title": "Ian Bremmer explains why Trump can't act on his 'authoritarian leanings'", "description": "President Donald Trump has many \"authoritarian leanings,\" but the structure of America's political system ultimately restrains him from being a full-blown authoritarian leader, Ian Bremmer tells INSIDER.

But now fierce competition from mid-priced phones from makers such as Xiaomi Corp <1810.HK> has become difficult to ignore.\n\nApple's vision of becoming a company driven by paid services such as Apple Music and iCloud rests on building as large a base of device owners as possible, with the iPhone serving as a critical anchor.\n\nWithout volume growth in promising overseas markets such as India, Brazil and Russia, the worry is that Apple has at least parts of its strategy wrong with too much emphasis on its premium brand and the high prices that go with it.\n\nA trio of Chinese smartphone makers - Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo - accounted for roughly a quarter of the global market in the first half of 2018, according to data from research firm IDC, up from just 8.9 percent for all of 2014.\n\nBut with the exception of fiscal 2015, Apple hasn't grown its market share. It had 13.6 percent of the world market in the first half of this year, down from 14.8 percent for 2014, although its share typically rises with full-year results due to strong sales in December.\n\nApple currently has what it calls an active installed base of 1.3 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs, serving as the pool of potential customers for its services - a business which hit $37.1 billion in revenue for the most recent fiscal year.\n\nThat represented 14 percent of Apple's overall revenue, up from 8.5 percent in fiscal 2015 when iPhone unit sales hit their all-time high.\n\nBut IDC expects the global smartphone market to grow only 2.4 percent on a compound basis to 1.6 billion units by 2022, indicating a saturated market in which the Cupertino, California-based firm will be fighting rivals for each customer.\n\nXiaomi, in particular, is gaining fans rapidly. In India, where Apple has only a minor presence, Xiaomi has in some quarters beat Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> to be the country's top phone seller and is also racing up the rankings in European markets where it is opening retail stores.\n\n\"This is the case where it's much different in other parts of the world,\" said Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC's mobile device tracking program.\n\n\"Many of those brands don't play (in the United States), but they're playing in places where they never played before.\"\n\nSUPPLIERS SUFFER\n\nIn its latest earnings this month, Apple shocked investors with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the holiday shopping quarter and with its announcement that it would stop reporting unit sales for its hardware products as has been customary for the last 20 years.\n\nUnderscoring flattening iPhone unit sales, it also said it sold 217.7 million iPhones in its most recent fiscal year, virtually unchanged from the year before and well below a high point of 231.2 million in fiscal 2015.\n\nIts share price, hit at the time of the forecast, has since extended losses after profit warnings from suppliers like Japan Display Inc <6740.T>, British chipmaker IQE Plc and Lumentum Holdings Inc . The stock is now down about 8 percent since its Nov. 1 earnings.\n\nApple declined to comment on the market moves. But its supply chain is vast, and the company's executives have warned investors in the past against fixating on sparse data points from it. And Apple has for more than a decade insisted that its gadgets should not be judged on their specs alone, an argument that sales data suggest Apple made successfully.\n\nApple's newest models such as the iPhone XS and iPhone XR are proving popular with its most loyal fans in wealthy economies. But they range up to $1,449 in price - out of reach for many consumers in less developed markets.\n\nApple's strategy is to lure those consumers to its eco-system with older models at cheaper prices. It has also emphasized that its phones are designed to last longer than the competition, expanded its repair options and crafted its most recent operating system update to speed up older devices.\n\nBut Chinese smartphone makers have been packing their phones with higher-end chips and features like under-the-glass fingerprint sensors that seek to lure consumers who might otherwise give Apple's phones a look.\n\nThose manufacturers are increasingly adopting Qualcomm's most powerful mobile phone chips, said Cristiano Amon, the head of chip operations at the U.S. chipmaker, which is locked in a bitter court dispute with Apple.\n\nThose phones were initially sold in China but \"we've also seen them gaining share outside China, especially in areas such as India and Europe,\" Amon said.\n\nOn its home turf, too, Apple is facing new challenges from at least one Chinese maker, OnePlus, which is creeping into the U.S. firm's traditional pricing territory.\n\nAfter years of being available in the United States only via an online store and developing a following among tech enthusiasts, the OnePlus 6T is being carried by T-Mobile US Inc stores.\n\nAt $549, it sits between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 in terms of pricing. Kyle Kiang, the general manager for North America for OnePlus, said sales are beating internal expectations so far, although he declined to disclose those figures.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Nick Zieminski)"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Nicky Lineaweaver", "title": "Athenahealth has sold for $5.7B (ATHN)", "description": "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \" Digital Health Briefing \" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Demand for Athenahealth's main software products has slowed \u2014 the firm hovered around 10% year-over-year revenue growth in each of the first three quarters of 2018, outpacing expectations but suffering a marked decline from previous growth rates.\n\nMoreover, the company's struggled to sustain growth in a market dominated by top EHR vendors like Cerner and Epic, accordi ng to Bloomberg. The company was also rocked by an unsolicited $7 billion acquisition bid from US hedge fund Elliott Management in May, and the June resignation of its former CEO Jonathan Bush amid controversy.\n\nBut the acquisition could give Athenahealth the turnaround it needs. Athenahealth could lean on Virence's services to ease providers' transition to VBC. The vast majority(79%) of US providers have a negative outlook on VBC, partly due to being overburdened by the time it takes to use EHRs to comply with data-reporting standards. Consolidating with Virence could allow Athenahealth to build out its EHR platform with a suite of VBC services, making its platform more valuable to healthcare providers.\n\nAthenahealth's struggles are indicative of a broader shift in the health IT market. As health systems begin to internalize data and analytics, EHR companies specializing in just a few core services will likely be pushed out of the market. Healthcare providers are demanding increasingly complex health IT solutions, and the successful players will be those that invest in ancillary services and partnerships that provide a full suite of solutions."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alexandra Ma", "title": "China tells Congress to back off after planned legislation looks to sanction Beijing over imprisoning Muslims", "description": "A group of bipartisan lawmakers plans to issue legislation on Wednesday designed to punish China over its persecution of its Muslim ethnic minority, known as the Uighurs.

Every ton of recycled aluminum cans (about 64,000 of them) keeps 10 tons of CO 2 out of the atmosphere, according to Popular Mechanics.\n\nBut recycling is no panacea for climate change.\n\nIf we hope to limit some of the disastrous effects of climate change, we must make drastic cuts\u2014 and soon \u2014 to greenhouse gas emissions in electricity production, transportation, industrial work, farming, and other sectors.\n\n\"There's no stopping global warming,\" Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist who is the director of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies, previously told Business Insider. \"Everything that's happened so far is baked into the system.\"\n\nThat means that even if carbon emissions were to drop to zero tomorrow, we'd still be watching human-driven climate change play out for centuries. Even then, emissions aren't going to stop immediately. The key thing now, Schmidt said, is to slow climate change down enough to allow us to adapt as painlessly as possible.\n\nIn 2016, planet Earth's temperature averaged 1.26 degrees Celsius above preindustrial averages, which is dangerously close to the 1.5-degree-Celsius limit set by international policymakers in the Paris climate accord.\n\nNot exceeding that limit will be significantly more challenging, since President Donald Trump \u2014 who previously called climate change \"a hoax\" \u2014 plans to withdraw the US from the accord.

It's not clear whether existing investors, including Draper Esprit and Index Ventures, would participate in the next round.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nFor context, Revolut raised $250 million only a few months ago, in April, bumping the neobank's valuation to $1.7 billion.

These two moves would mark Softbank's first investments into the UK fintech market, according to The Times.\n\nRevolut has welcomed 3 million customers, likely increasing investor confidence in the startup.

And it's all thanks to Brooklinen. Your favorite place to shop for sheets, linens, and the like on the internet has now turned its attention to the smallest members of your family. Meet Brooklittles, the smaller and gentler version of Brooklinen's already renowned bedding. And if you thought babies were cute, just wait until you see this baby collection.\n\nThe gender-neutral collection combines the same chic elegance that has become synonymous with the Brooklinen name with an even softer material that is gentle on baby's skin. From crib sheets to swaddles to toddler bedding to blankets, Brooklinen now has your baby covered from the moment they come home (and then some).\n\nI love the look of the mini crib sheet set ($32) and crib sheet set ($52), which will fit snuggly on your baby's first bed. Made of 100% long-staple cotton and OEKO-TEX certified chemical-free, these sheets are made in Israel and boast a particularly smooth sateen weave. And thanks to their deep pockets, you won't have to worry about the sheets coming off even if your baby tosses and turns. Really, once you've felt these sheets, you'll wonder why you ever outgrew your own crib. The set comes in four precious patterns, and I'm particularly taken with the New York City option (pictured above), which decorates your baby's sheets with little pizza slices, taxis, pretzels, and all things NYC.\n\nBrooklittles baby swaddle set, $38 Brooklinen\n\nThen, there's the toddler sheet set ($68) and complete toddler bed set ($188), made specifically for small beds (but not a crib). Like the crib set, these sheets are also made of 100% organic cotton in Israel, and are entirely hypoallergenic. The 400-thread-count sateen shell may introduce your child to the lap of luxury a bit too early, but hey, if you're going to spoil your child, might as well do it with bedding, right? The full bed set comes complete with a pillowcase, duvet cover, fitted sheet, comforter, and pillow, so you can take care of all bedding all at once. To avoid any hazardous conditions, there are no buttons to speak of on either the pillow case or the duvet cover (everything uses envelope enclosures and stitches to keep things in place), and both inserts and covers can be machine washed.\n\nMore precious still is the swaddle set ($38), which is constructed with 70% bamboo and 30% cotton. Incredibly soft and gentle, these three swaddle cloths are perfect for wrapping your newborn in what I imagine clouds must feel like. The combination of cotton and bamboo makes for an extremely delicate knit, so it's well-suited for even the most sensitive skin. While you certainly shouldn't leave these swaddle cloths in a crib, you could use them as burp cloths, stroller covers, or a nursing cover. And because they come in a set of three, you'll have a couple extra to keep around if baby loves one of them a little too much.\n\nBrooklittles baby quilt set, $128 Brooklinen\n\nFinally, there's the baby quilt set ($128), which comes with a quilt, a quilted sham, and a sham insert, all in white with grey stitching. Elegant and sophisticated, this is the pattern I wish I had on my own bed. And while the quilt may be more appropriate for summer months given its lightweight nature, for the winter months to come, you could always check out the alpaca baby blanket ($118), otherwise known as \"what I want for the holidays.\"\n\nHonestly, it's unfair that as we grow older, we're expected to grow out of our baby blankets, especially because this is one blanket I want to take with me everywhere.

The oven is Wi-Fi-enabled and connects to an app with hundreds of recipes. The user simply needs to select a recipe on the app or scan the barcode on one of the service's prepared meals, and the oven will then do all of the work.\n\nIn February, Tovala received an undisclosed amount of funding from the food giant Tyson Foods. The capital raised was to be used to support Tovala's growth, including adding staff across all departments, geographic expansion, and investment in product, operations, technology, and marketing, Tovala said in a press release at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tovala launched its new and improved second-generation machine, which is lighter than its predecessor and has a new function that enables users to cook without using the app. The first machine was rolled out in 2017.\n\nFind out how it works below:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Rosalie Chan", "title": "Here's why Walmart is betting on Microsoft's AI to challenge Amazon in online and physical retail (WMT, MSFT)", "description": "Walmart will partner with Microsoft to use artificial intelligence technology for the retail giant's e-commerce site, price adjustments, and expanding its online grocery program.

He discovered that incompetence was the main cause of the crisis, and it was rooted in a toxic culture of bureaucracy and fear of communication.\n\nRecently, at the 2018 New York Times DealBook Conference, Barra told the Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin that the experience changed her leadership style, and in turn changed GM's culture. \"I've become much more impatient about how we do things and how quickly we do things,\" she said.\n\nRead more: How GM went from a government bailout and bankruptcy to being one of the world's best-run car companies a decade later\n\nBarra is a GM lifer, and spent 33 years at the automaker before becoming CEO. In her executive roles leading to the top job, she became familiar with the ways GM's more than 200,000 employees had become accustomed to a slow-moving, overly complicated culture that Business Insider's Matthew DeBord said \"was organized for conflict.\" When Barra was the head of HR in 2009, for example, she reduced a 10-page dress code into two words, \"Dress appropriately,\" empowering managers to interpret that for their particular team.\n\nIn the top role, overseeing the ignition switch crisis, she accelerated this impatience she had with arbitrary rules and processes that restricted employees and their managers. She needed to dismantle the decades-old culture that resulted in employees not voicing concerns and then committees dismissing concerns when they did arise \u2014 to fatal consequences.\n\nAt an internal town hall meeting in 2014, Barra told her company, according to Fortune, \"I never want to put this behind us. I want to put this painful experience permanently in our collective memories.\"\n\nShe also launched the \"Speak Up For Safety\" hotline as a way for employees to easily and quickly report concerns they have about vehicles. \"Because the best time to solve a problem is the minute you know about it,\" Barra told Sorkin. \"Most problems don't get smaller with time.\"\n\nBarra's leadership changed internal and external perceptions of the company. Her first year on the job, GM broke sales records despite the recall scandal. And while GM, with a frustrating lack of stock growth, is still working to prove itself to shareholders, there is no question that Barra has vastly improved the company's management.\n\nAs she told Sorkin, the ignition switch crisis taught her that the best leaders are transparent with their employees and clear about their expectations.\n\n\"We have 200,000 employees at General Motors \u2014 they want to do the right thing,\" she said. \"Just make sure they know you want them to do the right thing.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Mara Leighton", "title": "Allbirds has dropped a brand-new high-top sneaker made with a sustainable foam sole \u2014 here's how it feels in person", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

There's nothing wrong with them; they do one job, and they do it so well they can't do anything else \u2014 like look good.\n\nAnd yet, the merino wool sneakers that snagged the colloquial title of \"the world's most comfortable shoes\" also happened to be really cool looking. Where ergonomic clogs failed in Silicon Valley and New York City, Allbirds runners ($95) flourished with ease.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup knows how to make comfortable shoes that look good. And they opt to do so out of smart, eco-friendly materials: sneakers made from super-soft, merino wool, skippers made from eucalyptus pulp, and flip-flops made from the world's first-ever sugarcane EVA foam.\n\nAs of November 2018, Allbirds has combined all three of its cult-favorite materials into one shoe: the Tree Toppers ($115).\n\nThe classic high-tops have a sugarcane EVA foam for the sole, super-soft merino wool on the inside, and eucalyptus tree fiber on the outside. You can pick a pair up in four colors at the moment: two core colors of Kauri Jo and Charcoal, or two limited edition colors of Zin (red) and Fiddle Leaf (green).\n\nThe new Allbirds Tree Toppers are available in four colors. Allbirds\n\n$115 isn't cheap, but Allbirds are a particularly good place to invest that money if you're willing to buy fewer but better shoes. They're some of the most comfortable, low-maintenance pairs we've ever found, and you'll find at least one of our product viewers \u2014 people with more granular knowledge of products than is probably healthy \u2014 opting to wear one of its styles around the office every day. They travel well, feel good, and a purchase of one Allbirds pair also happens to support better, more sustainable business practices \u2014 as recently seen in the company's decision not to patent the world's first carbon-negative EVA foam so other companies could use it. It's also a bonus that you can throw them in the washing machine and they look like new again 30 minutes later.\n\nWe tested the Tree Toppers ahead of their November 14 launch, and we found them to be pretty great overall. The tree fiber is breathable and flexible, the sugarcane foam responsive and plush, and the super-soft merino wool is warm and comfortable for the interior. All in all, it's a great shoe \u2014 if you like the look, you won't be disappointed by the feel.\n\nShop the Tree Toppers here, or continue to our reviews for the men's and women's versions below:\n\nShown in Zin, $115 Allbirds\n\nAllbirds' Tree Toppers are probably the most comfortable pair of Allbirds I've tested \u2014 probably because they're essentially flexible, secure gloves made from all the materials that have made Allbirds famous.\n\nI was concerned the high-top style may feel stiff or unnaturally thick, but the tree fiber is responsive and flexible throughout \u2014 fitting close around my ankle without any of the chafing that you might expect from wearing ankle socks with high-tops for the first time. It feels effortless. The Tree fiber is as breathable as it was in the Tree Runners, the interior merino wool is still surprisingly soft, and the carbon-negative foam soles as sturdy and bouncy as any other. It's a good mix of the warm and cozy properties of the wool shoe and the light breeziness of the Tree collection. All in all, I love them. I'll probably wear them frequently into work, on the weekends, and for traveling.\n\nShown in Kauri Jo, $115 Allbirds\n\nDavid Slotnick, Insider Picks senior reporter: Men's Tree Topper, $115 (4 colors)\n\nI've been an Allbirds fan for a year or so. My Tree Runners were a summer staple, and I wear my Wool Runners pretty much any time I travel \u2014 they're breathable but warm and comfy, and they're just as well suited to a day walking around a city as they are to spending 10 hours in the air in an economy seat. They're not the best rain shoe, but they compare reasonably well to any other pair of sneakers.\n\nThe Tree Toppers feel like a comfortable middle ground, with the light airiness of the Tree Runners, but insulated enough to wear around on a drizzly November day in New York City. The high-top style lends well to jeans or even chinos, and they feel snug and supportive without sacrificing comfort. I suspect these will become my next staple."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Jonathan Garber", "title": "Macy's reports mixed third-quarter results, raises its full-year guidance (M)", "description": "Macy's reported third-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, and net revenue that just missed.

If you go strictly by stock prices, US tech firms seem to be winning by a landslide, at least lately.\n\nAs the chart below shows, US tech companies are outperforming their Chinese counterparts to the largest extent since 2004. Strategists at BlackRock say this is largely because of the downward revisions to Chinese tech earnings, combined with peak profit growth in the US.\n\nBlackrock\n\nBut BlackRock also notes that this type of divergence is setting the stage for a reversion back to historical norms \u2014 which would mean a significant comeback for Chinese tech firms.\n\nThe chart below shows just how much latent upside may already exist in Chinese stocks.

During this period, the UK will be unable to sign meaningful new trade deals with other countries, because it will be locked into the EU's customs arrangements. It will also have to follow a number of strict EU rules in areas like the environment, employment protection, and state aid.\n\nCrucially there will also not be a fixed end date to the arrangement. Instead, an independent panel of adjudicators will decide when it can come to an end and the UK is free to leave the EU's orbit for good.\n\nHowever, as Politico reports on Wednesday, the EU expects the UK-wide customs union backstop to form the basis of a future trade deal.

AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein\n\nPutting Papua New Guinea on the map\n\nPNG's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill says he expects $85 million will be spent by leaders during the time of APEC alone and that playing host will put PNG on the map.\n\nO'Neill, whose first move as prime minister was to scrap the anti-corruption body Taskforce Sweep that ushered him into power and then began looking into his own affairs, has allocated around $350 million for the event.\n\nResponding to some of the considerable flak that has come his way, O'Neill says PNG is in fact hosting the cheapest APEC meeting compared to other countries.\n\nO'Neill said PNG is on the cusp of hosting one of the cheapest APEC Leaders meetings in history.\n\n\"We were given the green light to host APEC in October 2016 and in the same year, we budgeted ($US7.5 million) K25 million towards APEC.\"\n\nThat seems unlikely considering the summit's APEC house centerpiece is thought to have cost $75 million alone.\n\nStephen Howes, the Director of the Development Policy Centre and Professor of Economics in the Crawford School of Public Policy, ANU says the timing is not so great for a PNG facing mounting debts and rising corruption.\n\n\"Excessive borrowing in the boom years has now come back to haunt the government following a collapse in revenue,\" wrote in the ANU's East Asia Forum.\n\nBut in the second most rural country worldwide, Howes added that there is a stronger, more damning indicator for how things are faring in PNG.\n\nWhat has really caught the public's attention is the return of polio, previously eliminated from PNG about 20 years ago.\n\n\"PNG is one of only five countries in the world experiencing a polio comeback.\"\n\n\"That the other members of this club are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Nigeria and Somalia \u2014 all four wrought by violence \u2014 shows the extent of the health crisis that PNG is facing,\" Howes said.\n\n\"The most recent symptoms of this crisis include the resurgence of malaria and leprosy, and reports of worsening drug shortages.\"\n\nAustralian freelance journalist Jo Chandler herself contracted drug-resistant tuberculosis while investigating the growing crisis.\n\nSo what does Howes expect will come of PNG's APEC?\n\nAPEC he says will deliver a mild economic stimulus, and is expected to be accompanied by a round of \"announceables.\"\n\nThis is perhaps more likely than ever as the four regional pacific powers make their various bids for lasting influence.\n\n\"These may come from China or resource projects. Perhaps PNG will get more aid, but any resource project agreements will be ones that were already in the pipeline.\n\nHowes says that it is widely accepted (including by the government) that PNG needs to get a better deal from its resource projects. Rushing agreements so that they can be announced at APEC only weakens PNG's negotiating hand.\n\n\"By the same token though, APEC is meant to be about reform and development. PNG could have used its hosting of APEC to push through important change in a range of critical policy areas. It hasn't.\"\n\n\"Whatever happens at the leaders' meeting this year, in this fundamental sense APEC 2018 is a lost opportunity for its host.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Rosie Perper", "title": "The 10 most important things in the world right now", "description": "Hello!

Thomson Reuters\n\nFels said Guzman got a modest start in the 1970s, selling marijuana in Mexico before starting to build tunnels into the US. The tunnels distinguished Guzman, allowing him to move large quantities of drugs with such speed that he earned a new nickname, \"Rapido,\" or the quick one.\n\nGuzman was soon sending 10 to 15 planes \"stuffed with cocaine\" a day from Colombia to Mexico, where the drugs could be smuggled into the US, according to Fels.

Like the jurors, their identities are being kept secret for their protection.\n\n\"Why is the government going so far in this case using these gutter human beings as the evidence?\" he said. \"It's because the conviction of Chapo Guzman is the biggest prize this prosecution could ever dream of.\"\n\nEl Mayo's son, Vicente Zambada, who pleaded guilty to trafficking conspiracy in Chicago, has agreed to cooperate \"in any investigation\" as part of his deal and could take the stand as soon as Wednesday.\n\n\"They work together when it suits them, Mayo and the US government,\" Lichtman said. He told the jury the case would force them to \"throw out much of what you were taught to believe about the way government works.\"\n\nJudge Brian Cogan excused the jury for the day after the defense presented its theory and asked both sides to provide written briefs on the claims, suggesting the defense's line of argument will face more scrutiny.\n\nLichtman's remarks were cut short because of the delay needed to pick new jurors.

China for example likes to say it has historical roots to the region established sometime back in the 15th century.\n\nBut their are many other aggravating maritime and territorial factors in this increasingly dangerous part of the world.\n\nAs ASEAN's economic intensity has continued to build under the shade of China's decades-long economic boom, so has the waterway become a critical channel for a growing percentage of global commercial merchant shipping.\n\nChina itself still depends heavily on access through the Malacca Straits to satiate its appetite for energy and resources.\n\nNearby Japan and South Korea, both net importers, also depend enormously on free access to the South China Sea for unhindered shipments of fuel, resources and raw materials for both import and export.\n\nOn top of that, these are oceans rich and unregulated when it comes to natural resources. Nations like Vietnam and China furiously compete through fleets of private fishing vessels organised with state backing in a rush to exploit fishing grounds in dire need of governance.\n\nYet, the source of the most intense friction is the widely held belief that the South China Seas are home to abundant, as yet undiscovered oil and gas reserves.\n\nChina and ASEAN have been discussing changes to a 2002 declaration on the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea that would give the rules legal force.\n\nAs it stands, the declaration has proved wholly unable to stop Chinese island-building in the waters.\n\nThe Spratly Islands, where China has been reclaiming land and building strategic assets, 2016 Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative/CSIS\n\nSouth China Sea nations including China, Vietnam and the Philippines seek opportunities to develop the plentiful reserves of energy that the sea is thought to hold.\n\nBut with the notable exception of China, backed by its heaving state-owned behemoths, like Sinopec and CNOOC these countries independently lack well-developed oil industries.\n\nWhich is where the US enters the frame.\n\nBeijing has obvious and probably well founded concerns that the US will seek to engage and then use joint oil development projects with ASEAN countries to build a legitimate commercial toehold and thus a greater presence in the sea.\n\nThe Nikkei Review noted that the South China Sea's lack of clear maritime boundaries makes it a difficult place to ban oil exploration by outside countries, according to a specialist in international law.\n\nAs part of the code of conduct, China has also proposed barring outside countries from taking part in joint military exercises with ASEAN countries in the South China Sea.\n\nASEAN members including Singapore have not agreed to this provision, creating another obstacle to concluding the negotiations.\n\nASEAN is moving to strengthen ties with China, as shown by last month's first-ever joint military exercises. At the same time, the Southeast Asian bloc plans to hold naval exercises with the US as early as next year.\n\nMeanwhile, this week Chinese president Xi Jinping will travel to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea to meet with the leaders of the eight Pacific islands that recognise China diplomatically and welcome Chinese investment.\n\nBeijing this week warned no country should try to obstruct its \"friendship and cooperation\" with Pacific nations that have already received over $3 billion in Chinese investment."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "Elon Musk's 'Teslaquila' drink clashes with Mexican tequila industry", "description": "AP Tesla co-founder Elon Musk and Mexico's tequila producers may be at odds over the agave-based drink.

In addition, Aston gave the public its first look at the first SUV in company history.\n\nThe first photos to feature the DBX show one of its prototypes powering through the Welsh countryside. Unlike Aston Martin's GT cars and sports cars, the DBX is built in a new factory at St. Athan in Wales as opposed to company headquarters in Gaydon, England.\n\nAston Martin \"Seeing a DBX development prototype in action is a momentous chapter in the story of our first SUV, for it is the moment it really comes alive,\" Aston Martin Lagonda president and CEO Andy Palmer said in a statement. \"DBX is so much more than 'just' an SUV; it will be the first model built at our brand-new facility in St Athan.\"\n\nRead more: We drove an ultra-stylish $273,244 Aston Martin DB11 Volante convertible \u2014 here's the verdict.\n\nAston Martin first introduced the idea of the DBX to the world at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show in the form of a two-door electric crossover coupe. However, the DBX concept that debuted at the show is nothing like the production car that we will see launched sometime in the fourth quarter of 2019. First off, the concept's two-door coupe body has been replaced by a traditional four-door SUV layout.\n\nThe Aston Martin DBX concept car from 2015. Aston Martin While Aston hasn't confirmed the off-roaders powertrain, it'll probably be more conventional than the all-electric unit that powered by the concept car. However, it's likely an EV variant will follow after the initial launch. Especially since the factory where the DBX is slated to built is the \"Home of Electrification\" for Aston Martin.\n\nOfficial pricing for the Aston Martin DBX has not been announced. But expect it to be priced in the $200,000 range along with rivals Bentley Bentayga, Range Rover Autobiography, and Lamborghini Urus."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Mara Leighton", "title": "6 places to buy wine and alcohol online for the holidays", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.
