That typically translates into monthly payments of about $300 \u2014 or about 7 percent of the starting salary of a brand new college graduate (which is more than $50,000 a year). Over time, this percentage declines, as the graduate receives raises. No wonder the overwhelming majority of college graduates repay their loans on time.\n\nI happen to have been an example \u2014 of a college graduate who did not deserve to have his loans forgiven. I grew up in a middle-class family that was doing fine but needed financial aid. My dad worked as a high school teacher, and my mom worked at a local college. I went to Yale with the help of extended family members who pitched in, a scholarship and student loans. In today\u2019s dollars, I graduated with about $22,000 in debt.\n\nAnd I certainly did not enjoy repaying it. I remember grumpily writing the checks. It was a meaningful amount of money for a young journalist. It also became a monthly reminder of how bureaucratically frustrating the Yale financial-aid office had been for my parents and me. If some politician had suggested canceling my debt, I might have signed on to the movement.\n\nBut it would have been a silly movement, one that conflated the real struggles of poor and working-class young adults with the mild discomforts of the professional class. The same is true today. A recent Brookings Institution study by Judith Scott-Clayton found that the loan-default rate for borrowers with a bachelor\u2019s degree was less than 8 percent. The default rate for borrowers without any degree was a miserable 40 percent.\n\nI understand why sweeping ideas like \u201ccancel all debt\u201d or \u201cfree college\u201d seem appealing. And I know that some four-year college graduates really are struggling. But this country has too many big problems to start showering the upper-middle-class with enormous government benefits.\n\nThe right approach is a debt-forgiveness program that helps families who really need it. People whose income is below a certain threshold should have some of their debt forgiven (expanding the income-based repayment programs that already exist). And federal financial aid should expand too, with a focus on poor, working-class and truly middle-class families.\n\nCongressional Republicans, unfortunately, have shown no interest in these issues. Now that Democrats have the House, let\u2019s see what they can come up with."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "SANDRA E.

For the sake of the new majority, now is precisely the time for squabbling over the shape and direction of the caucus \u2014 though Mr. Ryan should seriously rethink his talking points.\n\nWith a large freshman class on its way and the Democratic Party in the midst of a roaring debate about its core values, there will, of course, be clashes about who will have what kind of influence in the caucus, and which voices will lead the way. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the member-elect representing parts of the Bronx and Queens, does not share the political style or the priorities of Representative Conor Lamb, who was first elected in a special election in March from a decidedly Trumpy corner of Pennsylvania. Many incoming Democrats ran on the promise of disrupting the status quo. And there\u2019s a wide range of views about the degree to which the party should try to work with President Trump on issues of shared interest versus pursuing a path of total resistance. Members old and new need to air their grievances, hash out their differences and set a course for how the team can better function over the next two sure-to-be-bonkers years.\n\nFew would deny that the Democratic caucus is overdue for an overhaul. As has been noted repeatedly, it has a hard-earned reputation as a dead end for talented up-and-comers. The senior leadership team is stagnant, having kept a death grip on the top trio of jobs for the better part of a decade. (With 15 years at the top, Ms. Pelosi is the second-longest serving Democratic leader ever.) Committee chairmanships are doled out based heavily on seniority, and, once ensconced, chairmen are tougher to root out than kudzu. This system deprives younger members of the opportunity for growth and, worse still, deprives the entire party of a much-needed pipeline of talent. Republicans have been aggressively working to address this problem for years \u2014 for instance, by term-limiting their committee chairmen \u2014 and many Democratic members look longingly across at the aisle at what they\u2019ve accomplished.\n\nOther types of reform are being sought as well.

It\u2019s just a wonderful thing to have.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the kids were eating the equivalent of a peanut a day pretty much tells you that if they accidentally eat a peanut, they won\u2019t have a life-threatening reaction,\u201d Dr. Baker said.\n\nMichael Perkin, a clinical epidemiologist and pediatric allergy consultant at St. George\u2019s, University of London who wrote an accompanying editorial about the study, said the regimen was \u201cnot a walk in the park\u201d and requires tremendous discipline. Children are required to rest for two hours after receiving their daily dose but cannot fall asleep because of the risk of a reaction.\n\nDr. Perkin said that the long-term side effects of consuming allergens when one has a severe allergy are still unknown. But he described the results as \u201cbeyond exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a cure like an antibiotic that makes a bug go away and it\u2019s not there anymore,\u201d he said. But \u201cpsychologically it makes a massive difference if you can keep your kid from living in fear. These kids can eat enough peanut that parents no longer will have to worry about their teenage daughter kissing someone who\u2019s eaten peanut butter. You cannot estimate what a psychological relief that is.\u201d\n\nFor children like Carter Grodi, a junior in high school in Ocala, Fla., who completed the treatment a year ago and continues to ingest a small amount of peanut every day to maintain his low-level tolerance, the treatment was transformative, making it easier to go out with friends and make plans to go away for college."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "EMILY CHAN", "title": "Apparatchik\uff1a\u673a\u5173\u4eba\u5458\u53d8\u6210\u8d44\u672c\u5bb6", "description": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u6210\u529f\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u662f\u201c\u5b83\u628a\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u673a\u5173\u4eba\u5458\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u8d44\u672c\u5bb6\u201d\u30021980\u5e74\u4ee3\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u793e\u4f1a\u6380\u8d77\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u6ce2\u5b98\u5458\u4e0b\u6d77\u6d6a\u6f6e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5927\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7684\u5f15\u64ce\u7531\u6b64\u7f13\u7f13\u53d1\u52a8\u3002 Bryan Denton for The New York Times", "url": "https://cn.nytimes.com/culture/20181119/wod-apparatchik/?utm_source=RSS", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/world/25china-index-zh-hant/merlin_139116450_3a175e05-5163-4ce4-bd48-cf29b040161a-articleLarge.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:38:59Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1aapparatchik \u673a\u5173\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u515a\u653f\u5b98\u50da\n\n\n\n\u90a3\u4e9b\u66fe\u662f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u969c\u788d\u7684\u673a\u5173\u4eba\u5458(apparatchik)\u5316\u8eab\u4e3a\u6539\u9769\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u201c\u5f04\u6f6e\u513f\u201d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u8fd8\u5851\u9020\u7740\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u8109\u52a8\u683c\u5c40\u3002\n\n\u6539\u9769\u5f00\u653e\u56db\u5341\u5468\u5e74\uff0c\u65f6\u62a5\u63a8\u51fa\u7cfb\u5217\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e13\u9898\u62a5\u9053\u4e2d\u56fd\u89c4\u5219(China rules)\uff0c\u4ece\u65f6\u653f\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u79d1\u6280\u3001\u6587\u5316\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u63a2\u7a76\uff0c\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u5236\u8098\u73af\u7ed5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5d1b\u8d77\u6210\u4e3a\u4eca\u65e5\u4e4b\u8d85\u7ea7\u5927\u56fd\u7684\uff1b\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8f6c\u6298\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u53c8\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER", "title": "Netanyahu, Citing Israel\u2019s Security, Tries to Salvage His Government", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, facing the potential collapse of his governing coalition, said on Sunday, \u201cIn the middle of a battle, we do not play politics.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/19/world/19israel/19israel-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:17:23Z", "content": "Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who leads another party in Mr. Netanyahus coalition the hawkish Jewish Home party then demanded to be named defense minister; he was rebuffed by the prime minister.

A system built by OpenAI, a lab based in San Francisco, analyzed thousands of self-published books, including romance novels, science fiction and more. Google\u2019s Bert analyzed these same books plus the length and breadth of Wikipedia.\n\nEach system learned a particular skill by analyzing all that text. OpenAI\u2019s technology learned to guess the next word in a sentence. Bert learned to guess missing words anywhere in a sentence. But in mastering these specific tasks, they also learned about how language is pieced together.\n\nIf Bert can guess the missing words in millions of sentences (such as \u201cthe man walked into a store and bought a ____ of milk\u201d), it can also understand many of the fundamental relationships between words in the English language, said Jacob Devlin, the Google researcher who oversaw the creation of Bert. (Bert is short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.)\n\nThe system can apply this knowledge to other tasks. If researchers provide Bert with a bunch of questions and their answers, it learns to answer other questions on its own. Then, if they feed it news headlines that describe the same event, it learns to recognize when two sentences are similar. Usually, machines can recognize only an exact match.\n\nBert can handle the \u201ccommon sense\u201d test from the Allen Institute. It can also handle a reading comprehension test where it answers questions about encyclopedia articles. What is oxygen? What is precipitation? In another test, it can judge the sentiment of a movie review. Is the review positive or negative?\n\nThis kind of technology is \u201ca step toward a lot of still-faraway goals in A.I., like technologies that can summarize and synthesize big, messy collections of information to help people make important decisions,\u201d said Sam Bowman, a professor at New York University who specializes in natural language research.\n\nIn the weeks after the release of OpenAI\u2019s system, outside researchers applied it to conversation. An independent group of researchers used OpenAI\u2019s technology to create a system that leads a competition to build the best chatbot that was organized by several top labs, including the Facebook AI Lab. And this month, Google \u201copen sourced\u201d its Bert system, so others can apply it to additional tasks.

And so, I am donating an additional $1.8 billion to Hopkins that will be used for financial aid for qualified low- and middle-income students.\n\nThis will make admissions at Hopkins forever need-blind; finances will never again factor into decisions. The school will be able to offer more generous levels of financial aid, replacing loans for many students with scholarship grants. It will ease the burden of debt for many graduates. And it will make the campus more socioeconomically diverse.\n\nBut Hopkins is one school. A recent analysis by The Times found that at dozens of America\u2019s elite colleges, more students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent of that scale \u2014 even though many of those lower-income students have the qualifications to get in.\n\nAnd until recently, by some estimates, half of all high-achieving low- and middle-income students have not

Moviemakers decided to change the character\u2019s ethnicity early in the process, reportedly to avoid offending the Chinese government.\n\nAs recently as two decades ago, major Hollywood movies were sharply critical of China. \u201cSeven Years in Tibet,\u201d which depicts Chinese soldiers brutalizing Tibetans, was one of the top 100 grossing movies of 1997. Also that year, Disney released Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKundun\u201d \u2014 a sympathetic portrayal of the Dalai Lama\u2019s early life in Mao-era China and his subsequent exile in India \u2014 despite objections from the Chinese authorities.\n\nSeven Years in Tibet, 1997\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see something that\u2019s like \u2018Seven Years in Tibet\u2019 anymore,\u201d said Larry Shinagawa, a professor at Hawaii Tokai International College who specializes in Asian and Asian-American studies. Studios that make films critical of China, he said, risk being banned from releasing movies in the country.\n\nAt stake for China is more than just the validation of Hollywood\u2019s powerbrokers and celebrities. In speeches and at forums, President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well\u201d \u2014 to make sure a coherent, compelling and, most important, Communist Party-sanctioned narrative of China\u2019s rise to power reaches global audiences.\n\n\u201cThere is a notion that its propaganda has not worked well enough,\u201d said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cSo this is where the film industry comes in. There\u2019s a real sensitivity to the blockbuster power of Hollywood.\u201d\n\nChina has raised its influence in Hollywood by bankrolling a growing number of top-tier films.\n\nOf the top 100 highest-grossing films worldwide each year from 1997 to 2013, China helped finance only 12 Hollywood movies: 1997 1999 2000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2010 2012 2013 1997 1999 2000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2010 2012 2013 1997 1999 2000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2010 2012 2013 Sources: Box Office Mojo; IMDb\n\nBut in the five years that followed, China co-financed 41 top-grossing Hollywood films: 2015 2016 2014 2017 2018 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Sources: Box Office Mojo; IMDb\n\nHollywood studios are also eager to grab a slice of China\u2019s fast-growing box office market, which surpassed the United States\u2019 in total revenue for the first time ever in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nSuccess in China can make up for a disappointing box office performance at home or even transform a hit into a global blockbuster. By the same token, getting shut out of the Chinese market can be devastating for a movie.\n\nThat\u2019s a powerful incentive to avoid causing any offense to China.\n\nOne of China\u2019s top movie regulators spelled it out in a speech at the U.S.-China Film Summit in Los Angeles in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge market, and we want to share it with you,\u201d said Zhang Xun, then the president of the state-owned China Film Co-Production Corporation, speaking to a room full of Hollywood executives.\n\nThen came the condition. \u201cWe want films that are heavily invested in Chinese culture, not one or two shots,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see positive Chinese images.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s campaign to push a positive image abroad has extended beyond Hollywood.\n\nThe 2016 film \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d a $150 million China-Hollywood co-production starring Matt Damon, was China\u2019s highest-profile attempt to make a crossover hit. It was, by most measures, an international flop.\n\nSince then, China has stepped away from the big-budget co-production model, focusing instead on making features that cater to its large and still-expanding domestic market. To do that, it has enlisted Hollywood talent \u2014 producers, technical experts and even top celebrities.\n\nBut they have had to walk a fine line.\n\nA number of actors, musicians and other celebrities have been barred from entering the country over behavior deemed inappropriate or critical of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nHere\u2019s why some of them were barred from China: Justin Bieber \u201cBad behavior,\u201d according to the Chinese authorities.

With employees from more than 70 countries and regions working on television channels broadcasting in English, Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian, CGTN\u2019s mission is to report news for global audiences \u201cfrom a Chinese perspective.\u201d\n\nThe difference in the \u201cChinese perspective\u201d was most evident in CGTN\u2019s coverage this year of an unexpected proposal to abolish presidential term limits in China\u2019s Constitution. While Western news media outlets raced to explain why the amendment, which would open the door to President Xi\u2019s indefinite rule, was unprecedented, CGTN\u2019s anchors were calm \u2014 and eerily synchronized \u2014 in their message praising the change.\n\nVideo by Barbara Marcolini\n\nIt is difficult to tell whether China\u2019s push to soften its image through movies, media and cultural projects has been successful."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": null, "title": "CHINA: The Land That Failed to Fail...", "description": "CHINA: The Land That Failed to Fail...

It just had to wait. It\u2019s still waiting.\n\nIn the uncertain years after Mao\u2019s death, long before China became an industrial juggernaut, before the Communist Party went on a winning streak that would reshape the world, a group of economics students gathered at a mountain retreat outside Shanghai. There, in the bamboo forests of Moganshan, the young scholars grappled with a pressing question: How could China catch up with the West?\n\nIt was the autumn of 1984, and on the other side of the world, Ronald Reagan was promising \u201cmorning again in America.\u201d China, meanwhile, was just recovering from decades of political and economic turmoil. There had been progress in the countryside, but more than three-quarters of the population still lived in extreme poverty. The state decided where everyone worked, what every factory made and how much everything cost.\n\nThe students and researchers attending the Academic Symposium of Middle-Aged and Young Economists wanted to unleash market forces but worried about crashing the economy \u2014 and alarming the party bureaucrats and ideologues who controlled it.\n\nLate one night, they reached a consensus: Factories should meet state quotas but sell anything extra they made at any price they chose. It was a clever, quietly radical proposal to undercut the planned economy \u2014 and it intrigued a young party official in the room who had no background in economics. \u201cAs they were discussing the problem, I didn\u2019t say anything at all,\u201d recalled Xu Jing\u2019an, now 76 and retired. \u201cI was thinking, how do we make this work?\u201d\n\nHow China became a superpower\n\nThe Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation. The proposal that Mr. Xu took from the mountain retreat, soon adopted as government policy, was a pivotal early step in this astounding transformation.\n\nChina now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nChina today might be unrecognizable to its Communist founders, but the past still holds a powerful allure. \u201cRed tourism\u201d is a big industry. Bryan Denton for The New York Times It is less worried now about catching up to the West. Instead, it wonders how to pull ahead. Bryan Denton for The New York Times The country leads the world in the number of internet users and college graduates. It is now working to land a person on the moon. Bryan Denton for The New York Times Gone are the days when the state decided where everyone worked and what every factory made. Bryan Denton for The New York Times The world thought it would change China, but China\u2019s success has been so spectacular that it has changed the world. Bryan Denton for The New York Times\n\nAn epochal contest is underway. With President Xi Jinping pushing a more assertive agenda overseas and tightening controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war and is gearing up for what could be a new Cold War. Meanwhile, in Beijing the question these days is less how to catch up with the West than how to pull ahead \u2014 and how to do so in a new era of American hostility.\n\nThe pattern is familiar to historians, a rising power challenging an established one, with a familiar complication: For decades, the United States encouraged and aided China\u2019s rise, working with its leaders and its people to build the most important economic partnership in the world, one that has lifted both nations.\n\nDuring this time, eight American presidents assumed, or hoped, that China would eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization: Prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring China into the fold of democratic nations. Or the Chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot.\n\nBut neither happened. Instead, China\u2019s Communist leaders have defied expectations again and again. They embraced capitalism even as they continued to call themselves Marxists. They used repression to maintain power but without stifling entrepreneurship or innovation. Surrounded by foes and rivals, they avoided war, with one brief exception, even as they fanned nationalist sentiment at home. And they presided over 40 years of uninterrupted growth, often with unorthodox policies the textbooks said would fail.\n\nIn late September, the People\u2019s Republic of China marked a milestone, surpassing the Soviet Union in longevity. Days later, it celebrated a record 69 years of Communist rule. And China may be just hitting its stride \u2014 a new superpower with an economy on track to become not just the world\u2019s largest but, quite soon, the largest by a wide margin.\n\nThe world thought it could change China, and in many ways it has. But China\u2019s success has been so spectacular that it has just as often changed the world \u2014 and the American understanding of how the world works.\n\nThere is no simple explanation for how China\u2019s leaders pulled this off. There was foresight and luck, skill and violent resolve, but perhaps most important was the fear \u2014 a sense of crisis among Mao\u2019s successors that they never shook, and that intensified after the Tiananmen Square massacre and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nEven as they put the disasters of Mao\u2019s rule behind them, China\u2019s Communists studied and obsessed over the fate of their old ideological allies in Moscow, determined to learn from their mistakes. They drew two lessons: The party needed to embrace \u201creform\u201d to survive \u2014 but \u201creform\u201d must never include democratization.\n\nChina has veered between these competing impulses ever since, between opening up and clamping down, between experimenting with change and resisting it, always pulling back before going too far in either direction for fear of running aground.\n\nMany people said that the party would fail, that this tension between openness and repression would be too much for a nation as big as China to sustain. But it may be precisely why China soared.\n\nWhether it can continue to do so with the United States trying to stop it is another question entirely.\n\nApparatchiks Into Capitalists\n\nNone of the participants at the Moganshan conference could have predicted how China would take off, much less the roles they would play in the boom ahead. They had come of age in an era of tumult, almost entirely isolated from the rest of the world, with little to prepare them for the challenge they faced. To succeed, the party had to both reinvent its ideology and reprogram its best and brightest to carry it out.\n\nMr. Xu, for example, had graduated with a degree in journalism on the eve of Mao\u2019s violent Cultural Revolution, during which millions of people were purged, persecuted and killed. He spent those years at a \u201ccadre school\u201d doing manual labor and teaching Marxism in an army unit. After Mao\u2019s death, he was assigned to a state research institute tasked with fixing the economy. His first job was figuring out how to give factories more power to make decisions, a subject he knew almost nothing about. Yet he went on to a distinguished career as an economic policymaker, helping launch China\u2019s first stock market in Shenzhen.\n\nAmong the other young participants in Moganshan were Zhou Xiaochuan, who would later lead China\u2019s central bank for 15 years; Lou Jiwei, who ran China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and recently stepped down as finance minister; and an agricultural policy specialist named Wang Qishan, who rose higher than any of them.\n\nMr. Wang headed China\u2019s first investment bank and helped steer the nation through the Asian financial crisis. As Beijing\u2019s mayor, he hosted the 2008 Olympics. Then he oversaw the party\u2019s recent high-stakes crackdown on corruption. Now he is China\u2019s vice president, second in authority only to Xi Jinping, the party\u2019s leader.\n\nThe careers of these men from Moganshan highlight an important aspect of China\u2019s success: It turned its apparatchiks into capitalists.\n\nBureaucrats who were once obstacles to growth became engines of growth. Officials devoted to class warfare and price controls began chasing investment and promoting private enterprise. Every day now, the leader of a Chinese district, city or province makes a pitch like the one Yan Chaojun made at a business forum in September.\n\n\u201cSanya,\u201d Mr. Yan said, referring to the southern resort town he leads, \u201cmust be a good butler, nanny, driver and cleaning person for businesses, and welcome investment from foreign companies.\u201d\n\nIt was a remarkable act of reinvention, one that eluded the Soviets. In both China and the Soviet Union, vast Stalinist bureaucracies had smothered economic growth, with officials who wielded unchecked power resisting change that threatened their privileges.\n\nMikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, tried to break the hold of these bureaucrats on the economy by opening up the political system. Decades later, Chinese officials still take classes on why that was a mistake. The party even produced a documentary series on the subject in 2006, distributing it on classified DVDs for officials at all levels to watch.\n\nAfraid to open up politically but unwilling to stand still, the party found another way. It moved gradually and followed the pattern of the compromise at Moganshan, which left the planned economy intact while allowing a market economy to flourish and outgrow it.\n\nOnce an impoverished backwater, China is now the most significant rival to the United States. Wuhan, a former river town, has swelled into a metropolis of over 10 million. Bryan Denton for The New York Times A businessman stretched before a round of video golf at a hotel he built in Kunming. Bryan Denton for The New York Times Rising incomes have turned China into a nation of consumers. Bryan Denton for The New York Times In cities like Shanghai, Chinese schoolchildren outperform peers around the world. Bryan Denton for The New York Times Western economists doubted that innovation could take place under China\u2019s rigid bureaucracy. They were proved wrong. Bryan Denton for The New York Times\n\nParty leaders called this go-slow, experimental approach \u201ccrossing the river by feeling the stones\u201d \u2014 allowing farmers to grow and sell their own crops, for example, while retaining state ownership of the land; lifting investment restrictions in \u201cspecial economic zones,\u201d while leaving them in place in the rest of the country; or introducing privatization by selling only minority stakes in state firms at first.\n\n\u201cThere was resistance,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cSatisfying the reformers and the opposition was an art.\u201d\n\nAmerican economists were skeptical. Market forces needed to be introduced quickly, they argued; otherwise, the bureaucracy would mobilize to block necessary changes. After a visit to China in 1988, the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman called the party\u2019s strategy \u201can open invitation to corruption and inefficiency.\u201d\n\nBut China had a strange advantage in battling bureaucratic resistance. The nation\u2019s long economic boom followed one of the darkest chapters of its history, the Cultural Revolution, which decimated the party apparatus and left it in shambles. In effect, autocratic excess set the stage for Mao\u2019s eventual successor, Deng Xiaoping, to lead the party in a radically more open direction.\n\nThat included sending generations of young party officials to the United States and elsewhere to study how modern economies worked. Sometimes they enrolled in universities, sometimes they found jobs, and sometimes they went on brief \u201cstudy tours.\u201d When they returned, the party promoted their careers and arranged for others to learn from them.\n\nAt the same time, the party invested in education, expanding access to schools and universities, and all but eliminating illiteracy. Many critics focus on the weaknesses of the Chinese system \u2014 the emphasis on tests and memorization, the political constraints, the discrimination against rural students. But mainland China now produces more graduates in science and engineering every year than the United States, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan combined.\n\nIn cities like Shanghai, Chinese schoolchildren outperform peers around the world. For many parents, though, even that is not enough. Because of new wealth, a traditional emphasis on education as a path to social mobility and the state\u2019s hypercompetitive college entrance exam, most students also enroll in after-school tutoring programs \u2014 a market worth $125 billion, according to one study, or as much as half the government\u2019s annual military budget.\n\nAnother explanation for the party\u2019s transformation lies in bureaucratic mechanics. Analysts sometimes say that China embraced economic reform while resisting political reform. But in reality, the party made changes after Mao\u2019s death that fell short of free elections or independent courts yet were nevertheless significant.\n\nThe party introduced term limits and mandatory retirement ages, for example, making it easier to flush out incompetent officials. And it revamped the internal report cards it used to evaluate local leaders for promotions and bonuses, focusing them almost exclusively on concrete economic targets.\n\nThese seemingly minor adjustments had an outsize impact, injecting a dose of accountability \u2014 and competition \u2014 into the political system, said Yuen Yuen Ang, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. \u201cChina created a unique hybrid,\u201d she said, \u201can autocracy with democratic characteristics.\u201d\n\nAs the economy flourished, officials with a single-minded focus on growth often ignored widespread pollution, violations of labor standards, and tainted food and medical supplies. They were rewarded with soaring tax revenues and opportunities to enrich their friends, their relatives and themselves. A wave of officials abandoned the state and went into business. Over time, the party elite amassed great wealth, which cemented its support for the privatization of much of the economy it once controlled.\n\nThe private sector now produces more than 60 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output, employs over 80 percent of workers in cities and towns, and generates 90 percent of new jobs, a senior official said in a speech last year. As often as not, the bureaucrats stay out of the way.\n\n\u201cI basically don\u2019t see them even once a year,\u201d said James Ni, chairman and founder of Mlily, a mattress manufacturer in eastern China. \u201cI\u2019m creating jobs, generating tax revenue. Why should they bother me?\u201d\n\nIn recent years, President Xi has sought to assert the party\u2019s authority inside private firms. He has also bolstered state-owned enterprises with subsidies while preserving barriers to foreign competition. And he has endorsed demands that American companies surrender technology in exchange for market access.\n\nIn doing so, he is betting that the Chinese state has changed so much that it should play a leading role in the economy \u2014 that it can build and run \u201cnational champions\u201d capable of outcompeting the United States for control of the high-tech industries of the future. But he has also provoked a backlash in Washington.\n\n\u2018Opening Up\u2019\n\nIn December, the Communist Party will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the \u201creform and opening up\u201d policies that transformed China. The triumphant propaganda has already begun, with Mr. Xi putting himself front and center, as if taking a victory lap for the nation.\n\nHe is the party\u2019s most powerful leader since Deng and the son of a senior official who served Deng, but even as he wraps himself in Deng\u2019s legacy, Mr. Xi has set himself apart in an important way: Deng encouraged the party to seek help and expertise overseas, but Mr. Xi preaches self-reliance and warns of the threats posed by \u201chostile foreign forces.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he appears to have less use for the \u201copening up\u201d part of Deng\u2019s slogan.\n\nOf the many risks that the party took in its pursuit of growth, perhaps the biggest was letting in foreign investment, trade and ideas. It was an exceptional gamble by a country once as isolated as North Korea is today, and it paid off in an exceptional way: China tapped into a wave of globalization sweeping the world and emerged as the world\u2019s factory. China\u2019s embrace of the internet, within limits, helped make it a leader in technology. And foreign advice helped China reshape its banks, build a legal system and create modern corporations.\n\nThe party prefers a different narrative these days, presenting the economic boom as \u201cgrown out of the soil of China\u201d and primarily the result of its leadership. But this obscures one of the great ironies of China\u2019s rise \u2014 that Beijing\u2019s former enemies helped make it possible.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has shown no sign of abandoning what he calls \u201cthe great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u201d The observation deck of the Shanghai Tower, the world\u2019s second-tallest building.

The real game changers, though, were people like Tony Lin, a factory manager who made his first trip to the mainland in 1988.\n\nMr. Lin was born and raised in Taiwan, the self-governing island where those who lost the Chinese civil war fled after the Communist Revolution. As a schoolboy, he was taught that mainland China was the enemy.\n\nBut in the late 1980s, the sneaker factory he managed in central Taiwan was having trouble finding workers, and its biggest customer, Nike, suggested moving some production to China. Mr. Lin set aside his fears and made the trip. What he found surprised him: a large and willing work force, and officials so eager for capital and know-how that they offered the use of a state factory free and a five-year break on taxes.\n\nMr. Lin spent the next decade shuttling to and from southern China, spending months at a time there and returning home only for short breaks to see his wife and children. He built and ran five sneaker factories, including Nike\u2019s largest Chinese supplier.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s policies were tremendous,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey were like a sponge absorbing water, money, technology, everything.\u201d\n\nMr. Lin was part of a torrent of investment from ethnic Chinese enclaves in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and beyond that washed over China \u2014 and gave it a leg up on other developing countries. Without this diaspora, some economists argue, the mainland\u2019s transformation might have stalled at the level of a country like Indonesia or Mexico.\n\nThe timing worked out for China, which opened up just as Taiwan was outgrowing its place in the global manufacturing chain. China benefited from Taiwan\u2019s money, but also its managerial experience, technology and relationships with customers around the world. In effect, Taiwan jump-started capitalism in China and plugged it into the global economy.\n\nBefore long, the government in Taiwan began to worry about relying so much on its onetime enemy and tried to shift investment elsewhere. But the mainland was too cheap, too close and, with a common language and heritage, too familiar. Mr. Lin tried opening factories in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia but always came back to China.\n\nNow Taiwan finds itself increasingly dependent on a much more powerful China, which is pushing ever harder for unification, and the island\u2019s future is uncertain.\n\nThere are echoes of Taiwan\u2019s predicament around the world, where many are having second thoughts about how they rushed to embrace Beijing with trade and investment.\n\nThe remorse may be strongest in the United States, which brought China into the World Trade Organization, became China\u2019s largest customer and now accuses it of large-scale theft of technology \u2014 what one official called \u201cthe greatest transfer of wealth in history.\u201d\n\nMany in Washington predicted that trade would bring political change. It did, but not in China. \u201cOpening up\u201d ended up strengthening the party\u2019s hold on power rather than weakening it. The shock of China\u2019s rise as an export colossus, however, was felt in factory towns around the world.\n\nIn the United States, economists say at least two million jobs disappeared as a result, many in districts that ended up voting for President Trump.\n\nSelective Repression\n\nOver lunch at a luxurious private club on the 50th floor of an apartment tower in central Beijing, one of China\u2019s most successful real estate tycoons explained why he had left his job at a government research center after the crackdown on the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square.\n\n\u201cIt was very easy,\u201d said Feng Lun, the chairman of Vantone Holdings, which manages a multibillion-dollar portfolio of properties around the world. \u201cOne day, I woke up and everyone had run away. So I ran, too.\u201d\n\nUntil the soldiers opened fire, he said, he had planned to spend his entire career in the civil service. Instead, as the party was pushing out those who had sympathized with the students, he joined the exodus of officials who started over as entrepreneurs in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cAt the time, if you held a meeting and told us to go into business, we wouldn\u2019t have gone,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo this incident, it unintentionally planted seeds in the market economy.\u201d\n\nSuch has been the seesaw pattern of the party\u2019s success.\n\nThe pro-democracy movement in 1989 was the closest the party ever came to political liberalization after Mao\u2019s death, and the crackdown that followed was the furthest it went in the other direction, toward repression and control. After the massacre, the economy stalled and retrenchment seemed certain. Yet three years later, Deng used a tour of southern China to wrestle the party back to \u201creform and opening up\u201d once more.\n\nMany who had left the government, like Mr. Feng, suddenly found themselves leading the nation\u2019s transformation from the outside, as its first generation of private entrepreneurs.\n\nNow Mr. Xi is steering the party toward repression again, tightening its grip on society, concentrating power in his own hands and setting himself up to rule for life by abolishing the presidential term limit. Will the party loosen up again, as it did a few years after Tiananmen, or is this a more permanent shift? If it is, what will it mean for the Chinese economic miracle?\n\nThe fear is that Mr. Xi is attempting to rewrite the recipe behind China\u2019s rise, replacing selective repression with something more severe.\n\nFor decades, China has veered between openness and repression, including of the ethnic Uighur minority. Bryan Denton for The New York Times Since the Tiananmen movement, the government has been vigilant about crushing potential threats. Surveillance cameras in Beijing. Bryan Denton for The New York Times China\u2019s high-speed rail network, the largest in the world, has changed the way its people move. In Hangzhou, passengers waited outside the railway station. Bryan Denton for The New York Times As China opened up, farmers were allowed to grow and sell their own crops, while the state retained ownership of the land. Greenhouses filled with bok choy and yellow cabbage abut investment properties and golf courses. Under Mao, many educated Chinese were sent to \u201ccadre schools,\u201d where they did manual labor. In May, these real estate agency employees went for a morning run as part of a company team-building exercise. Bryan Denton for The New York Times\n\nThe party has always been vigilant about crushing potential threats \u2014 a fledgling opposition party, a popular spiritual movement, even a dissident writer awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But with some big exceptions, it has also generally retreated from people\u2019s personal lives and given them enough freedom to keep the economy growing.\n\nThe internet is an example of how it has benefited by striking a balance. The party let the nation go online with barely an inkling of what that might mean, then reaped the economic benefits while controlling the spread of information that could hurt it.\n\nIn 2011, it confronted a crisis. After a high-speed train crash in eastern China, more than 30 million messages criticizing the party\u2019s handling of the fatal accident flooded social media \u2014 faster than censors could screen them.\n\nPanicked officials considered shutting down the most popular service, Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, but the authorities were afraid of how the public would respond. In the end, they let Weibo stay open but invested much more in tightening controls and ordered companies to do the same.\n\nThe compromise worked. Now, many companies assign hundreds of employees to censorship duties \u2014 and China has become a giant on the global internet landscape.\n\n\u201cThe cost of censorship is quite limited compared to the great value created by the internet,\u201d said Chen Tong, an industry pioneer. \u201cWe still get the information we need for economic progress.\u201d\n\nA \u2018New Era\u2019\n\nChina is not the only country that has squared the demands of authoritarian rule with the needs of free markets. But it has done so for longer, at greater scale and with more convincing results than any other.\n\nThe question now is whether it can sustain this model with the United States as an adversary rather than a partner.\n\nThe trade war has only just begun. And it is not just a trade war. American warships and planes are challenging Chinese claims to disputed waters with increasing frequency even as China keeps ratcheting up military spending. And Washington is maneuvering to counter Beijing\u2019s growing influence around the world, warning that a Chinese spending spree on global infrastructure comes with strings attached.\n\nThe two nations may yet reach some accommodation. But both left and right in America have portrayed China as the champion of an alternative global order, one that embraces autocratic values and undermines fair competition. It is a rare consensus for the United States, which is deeply divided about so much else, including how it has wielded power abroad in recent decades \u2014 and how it should do so now.\n\nMr. Xi, on the other hand, has shown no sign of abandoning what he calls \u201cthe great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u201d Some in his corner have been itching to take on the United States since the 2008 financial crisis and see the Trump administration\u2019s policies as proof of what they have always suspected \u2014 that America is determined to keep China down.\n\nAt the same time, there is also widespread anxiety over the new acrimony, because the United States has long inspired admiration and envy in China, and because of a gnawing sense that the party\u2019s formula for success may be faltering.\n\nProsperity has brought rising expectations in China; the public wants more than just economic growth. It wants cleaner air, safer food and medicine, better health care and schools, less corruption and greater equality. The party is struggling to deliver, and tweaks to the report cards it uses to measure the performance of officials hardly seem enough.\n\n\u201cThe basic problem is, who is growth for?\u201d said Mr. Xu, the retired official who wrote the Moganshan report. \u201cWe haven\u2019t solved this problem.\u201d\n\nGrowth has begun to slow, which may be better for the economy in the long term but could shake public confidence. The party is investing ever more in censorship to control discussion of the challenges the nation faces: widening inequality, dangerous debt levels, an aging population.\n\nMr. Xi himself has acknowledged that the party must adapt, declaring that the nation is entering a \u201cnew era\u201d requiring new methods. But his prescription has largely been a throwback to repression, including vast internment camps targeting Muslim ethnic minorities. \u201cOpening up\u201d has been replaced by an outward push, with huge loans that critics describe as predatory and other efforts to gain influence \u2014 or interfere \u2014 in the politics of other countries. At home, experimentation is out while political orthodoxy and discipline are in.\n\nIn effect, Mr. Xi seems to believe that China has been so successful that the party can return to a more conventional authoritarian posture \u2014 and that to survive and surpass the United States it must.\n\nCertainly, the momentum is still with the party. Over the past four decades, economic growth in China has been 10 times faster than in the United States, and it is still more than twice as fast. The party appears to enjoy broad public support, and many around the world are convinced that Mr. Trump\u2019s America is in retreat while China\u2019s moment is just beginning.\n\nThen again, China has a way of defying expectations."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "NICK SUMMERS", "title": "Times Insider: Making Business More Colorful", "description": "A Q. and A. with Wendy MacNaughton, the illustrator of Meanwhile, a new column exploring the people, places and things we usually overlook.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/reader-center/business-section-redesign-meanwhile.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/insider/18meanwhile-1/18meanwhile-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T12:16:22Z", "content": "You travel a lot.

It's going to have to be in some kind of sustainable fashion and it's going to have to be affordable. It's going to have to be accessible. It's going to have to be all of those at scale.

It opened our eyes to the reality that if we really want a better world for pets, the best way to do that is to invest in the veterinary practice.

The video game business, which is now overlapping the home computer business, has been beset by oversupply - and in some cases big losses - ever since. And, it's possible a similar situation could develop in home computers, especially if T.I. decides to unload its excess inventory at prices that would make today's $99 bargains seem high.\n\nWhat is most surprising about the home computer business, said Mr. Purdy and others, is that such price cutting should occur so quickly after the market was born. Before 1982, there really were no ''home'' computers for sale in general retail channels under $1,000. Personal computers, such as the Apple and I.B.M., were generally sold through computer specialty stores and were often used in business.\n\nIt was only last year that the home market started to develop as the price of computers dropped to little more than video games, as department stores and discount houses started carrying the machines and as the average homeowner developed a fear of his family being left behind in the computer age.\n\nThe home computer business is still healthy in the sense that sales are continuing to increase, although there is disagreement over just how strong demand will be. While there were perhaps two million home computers sold last year, some analysts estimate that about five million will be sold this year. Thus, other companies are quickly moving to try to divorce themselves from T.I.'s problems.\n\n''Basically, I don't think we have a disaster in progress in the home computer business,'' said John V. Roach, chairman and chief executive of the Tandy Corporation, which sells its home computer through its Radio Shack chain. Sales are continuing healthy growth, he and other industry executives said. But T.I. produced even more than the growing market could handle.\n\nTHE T.I. fiasco, however, might mark a shift in the way computers a remarketed and used. Fewer suppliers might survive at the low end, where computers sell for $100 or less and can be used for little more than playing video games or learning to program. Timex Corporation's sales of the first $100 computer have slowed despite a price reduction to below $50, and Mattel, a new entrant, is being stalled at the starting gate. Atari, one of the leaders of the market, has never made a profit in home computers.\n\nMore attention might be paid to more expensive machines, selling for a few hundred dollars, which can be used for more than the $100 machines that are mainly designed to play games. Coleco Industries' new $600 machine, Adam, is seen as the start of that trend. I.B.M. is also likely to enter the field later this year with a machine geared toward business-oriented uses in the home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA factor propelling that trend, in addition to the price war at the lower end, is a concern that home computer growth will slow unless the machine is made more useful. ''You'll never get to sell 10 million units a year on the basis of current products,'' said Clive Smith, an analyst with the Yankee Group, management consultants who say that improvements are needed in the amount of software and its ease of use. ''The whole home computer market is a market racing to live up to its own promise.''\n\nFOR Texas Instruments, the loss was a serious blow and raised questions about whether the company will abandon the business as it did digital watches. Even the fear that T.I. might pull out could deter retailers from placing orders, further damaging T.I.'s chances.\n\n''You can't play a defensive game in consumer electronics,'' said Adam F. Cuhney of Salomon Brothers, who thinks T.I. will not recover in the business. ''They are not in control of their own destiny.''\n\nThe company said the loss was caused by an unexpected slowdown in orders, particulary for software, that was brought about by a glut of home computers and video games on the market. T.I. said it was scaling down production and writing off excess inventory.\n\nBut the magnitude and the suddenness of the loss surprised and puzzled analysts. An after-tax loss of $100 million in the second quarter for the company as a whole translates into a pretax loss on home computers alone of $200 million to $250 million.\n\nTexas Instruments officials last week declined to be interviewed. ''Not a chance. Absolutely not a chance,'' said company spokesman Norman Neureiter. Indeed, even the home computer division's public relations manager, whose job it is to talk to the press about that specific T.I. activity, has not been allowed to talk to some publications in the last few weeks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In digital watches and calculators, T.I. helped drive prices so low that it ruined the business, even for itself.\n\nOne of the other companies severely hurt in the calculator wars was Commodore International, which was dependent on other companies for the chips it used and was therefore limited in how much it could cut costs. Since then, Commodore has vertically integrated. When Commodore and T.I. faced off again in home computers, Commodore was the winner. Mistake number one for T.I., analysts and competitors say, was getting into a price war with a more agile, lower-cost producer.\n\nT.I.'s home computer was first introduced in 1979 for $1,150 and was an embarrassing failure. T.I. discovered in 1982 that it could sell large volumes by cutting the price and offering rebates. But the T.I. 99/4A, which was little different from the machine that was originally designed to sell for $1,150, was no match cost-wise for Commodore's VIC-20. As Commodore and T.I. started their downhill race, it was inevitable that prices would get so low that T.I. would start losing money while Commodore stayed profitable. T.I. ''got suckered by Jack,'' said Harry Fox, president of Spectravideo, a new home computer company, referring to Commodore president Jack Tramiel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven that would not have been too bad had T.I. been able to make up for low-priced computers by making large profits on software and peripheral equipment as it had hoped. But there is a flaw in such a razor-and-blade approach to profits in the home computer market.\n\nThe history of the personal computer business, brief as it is, has shown that the successful machines are the ones that have the most and best software available for them. It has also shown that no single company can write all the software itself. It must take advantage of the cottage industry of programmers.\n\nYet if T.I. was to make its profits in software, the software that sold had to be its own, not that of others. That became clear in December, when Atari's profits took a plunge because other companies began making games for its video game machine that were better than the games Atari itself was selling. T.I., trying to balance those contradictory influences, decided to try to get other companies to write software for its machine, but insisted on marketing the software itself. But many software companies would have none of that.\n\nThe result was that T.I. discouraged software companies, putting its computer at a further disadvantage relative to the VIC-20 and other machines. And without other companies competing with it, T.I. did not put enough effort into developing its own software, particularly games, according to competitors and former employees. It also did not license popular arcade games like Zaxxon and Frogger, which are still the best selling programs for home computers. Its peripheral equipment, such as disk drives, were also overly expensive.\n\nTwo other mistakes helped administer the final blow. One was that T.I. became over-optimistic and produced too many machines. While most industry analysts expect about five million home computers to be sold this year, Texas Instruments, at its annual meeting in April, predicted industry sales would total 6.7 million. T.I. geared up to produce three million computers this year, and now might be able to sell only two million, according to Michael Krasko of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. Inventory piled up.\n\nT.I. also had to withdraw its computer from the market for about a month earlier this year to correct a potential electric shock hazard, for which T.I. took an unusually large $50 million charge against earnings in the first quarter. Inventories swelled because production continued while sales halted, and the product never regained its momentum when it reappeared.\n\nWith all that excess inventory, T.I. was stung when it reduced prices and had to make up the difference to retailers and distributors who were holding inventory purchased at the previous prices.\n\nFuture options are slim. The company said in its announcement that it plans to stay in the business. But it needs new products. One, a $100 computer introduced in January that was designed to be used to learn programming never got to market because prices for the more versatile 99/4A had already dropped almost that low by last spring.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe company was expected to introduce a more expensive machine, the 99/8 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago two weeks ago. But the machine, code-named the Armadillo, was not displayed publicly, partly because it would have been upstaged by Coleco's Adam, as well as by new products from Commodore and Atari. Its status is somewhat unclear. Mr. Purdy of Service Merchandise said that when he expressed interest in putting the 99/8 into the company's next catalog, T.I. officials were ''very vague about it.''\n\nIt is also believed T.I. is working on a bundled system, with software, printer and data storage device combined in a package. Indeed, bundling appears to be a new trend. Rather than competing on price for the basic unit, and hoping to earn a profit on purchases of software and peripherals later, manufacturers are starting to package everything together in an effort to recover their profit up front. Coleco's Adam, which will sell for $600, includes 80,000 characters of internal memory, a daisy-wheel printer, a tape storage device, game joysticks, a word-processing program and a game. The package will allow people at home to use the computer in place of a typewriter as well as for playing games.\n\nNot everyone is convinced, however, that bundling is the way to go. Mr. Tramiel of Commodore said that bundling makes the entry price for many consumers too high. Bundling also limits the consumers choice. ''They've made up your mind for you on what kind of printer you should have with your machine,'' said William G. Kelley, president of the American Home Video Corporation, a Denver-based electronics store chain.\n\nOne thing that seems certain is that movement will be away from game playing toward more powerful computers with greater capabilities. Those more versatile machines will drop in price to the point where they slow the sales of computers like the T.I. 99/4A and the VIC-20, just as those two computers dropped in price to the point where they slowed the sales of even less versatile video game machines and of computers like the Timex Sinclair 1000, which is used mostly to learn programming. Already Commodore has reduced the price of the Commodore 64 to about $200 wholesale and has started to deemphasize the less powerful VIC-20.\n\nI.B.M.'S entry into the home computer market, expected this fall with the introduction of Peanut, will accelerate that trend. The Peanut is expected to sell for aout $600 and will be compatible with I.B.M.'s more expensive personal computer. It would have a powerful 16-bit microprocessor, compared to the 8-bit chips in most home computers now. Mr. Smith of the Yankee Group predicts that, within a year, major home computer manufacturers will come out with new computers that can run their existing programs as well as programs written for the new I.B.M. machine. Japanese companies, who last week agreed on standard specifications for home computers, might also make an entrance into the American market.\n\nIronically, the move toward more powerful systems might actually restore in consumers' minds the computer's perceived value that had been damaged in the fierce price cutting. Said Mr. Kelley of American Home Video, ''When they went to $99, people started asking 'What's wrong with it?''

Why, after all, should math and music be connected? Music is an art, mathematics a science. Music poses no problems, mathematics thrives on them. Music has no practical use, mathematics often does. Music is sensuous, mathematics abstract. Analogies may just be vague metaphor or trivial coincidence.\n\nBut fundamental musical elements can be analyzed numerically - as the ancient Greeks knew. Pythagoras, to whom fundamental mathematical discoveries are attributed, believed music to be the expression of number in sound. Aristotle said of the Pythagoreans, ''They supposed the whole heaven to be a harmonia and a number.''\n\nThe musical harmony of the Pythagoreans was constructed with the first four integers. Dividing a vibrating string in ratios formed by these numbers, they discovered, generated ''pleasing'' musical intervals. The ratio 1:2 yields an octave, 3:2 yields the fifth, and 4:3 the fourth.\n\nIn later Western music the interval of the fourth fell out of favor and the sixth was added, but the idea remained the same. The rules of counterpoint, which governed combinations of musical lines, restricted intervals to those formed by such simple ratios. The tonal harmonic system, so familiar to us from the music of the 18th- and 19th-centuries, is also founded on these ratios, and upon ''harmonics'' - higher pitched tones created when any note is sounded. Musics of all cultures involve systematic organization of such ratios.\n\nThe numerical properties of sound have also been subject to more sophisticated analysis, using techniques developed by an 18thcentury mathematician, Jean Baptiste Fourier, and, in our century, computer technology. ''Digital'' recordings, for example, involve exact translations of sound into number. Such precision has also permitted the synthesis and complex organizations of sound found in contemporary electronic music.\n\nBut such numerical properties of sound and the musical systems based on them do not say much about the experience of music. Few listeners care about integral ratios of string vibrations. Few listeners hear a 12-tone series played backwards. Few listen to tonal music for the way harmonic ''rules'' are followed. Music is involved in more than mere combinatorial analysis. And mathematics is more than just a mechanical manipulation of abstract signs. The links between math and music are deeper and more profound.\n\nIn fact, if music displays a certain systematic ''mathematical'' character, there are corresponding ''musical'' qualities to mathematics, esthetic qualities that have been often described by its practitioners.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe mathematician G.H. Hardy wrote of the ''harmonious'' character of mathematics: ''Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.'' The mathematician Henri Poincare also wrote about ''the feeling of mathematical beauty, of the harmony of numbers, of forms, of geometric elegance.''\n\nThis ''harmony'' is difficult to explain. But one ancient example of beauty that offers some clues to the esthetics of mathematics is the ''golden ratio,'' considered by the Pythagoreans to be the most beautiful of proportions. The ''golden rectangle,'' with sides in that ratio, has been linked with the proportions of the Parthenon in Athens and exercised fascination on Renaissance artists. In 1509, a book by Luca Pacioli called ''De Divina Proportione'' was illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci; the painter also used the ratio in his painting. Kepler invoked this ''divine proportion'' as well. Recently, ''The Divine Proportion; A Study in Mathematical Beauty'' by H.E. Huntley has attempted a mathematical and esthetic survey of the ratio.\n\nThe definition of this ratio is rather simple. A line is divided into a ''golden section'' when the ratio of its two parts is the same as the ratio between one part and the whole. The ratio, that is, reproduces itself within itself. The diagonals of a pentagon divide each other in this ratio; it appears in other geometrical configurations as well.\n\nAs a number, the ratio might seem unattractive (it is equal to (-5 -1) / 2). But it can be rewritten in a quite remarkable way, as a fraction composed entirely of 1's layered in an infinite series. Seen in that way, the number becomes a sort of arithmetic ''image'' of the geometric property of the ratio - it is represented endlessly within itself. As the illustration on the front page shows, for example, if a square formed by one side of a golden rectangle is cut off, a golden rectangle remains. If squares are continually removed, there is an infinite spiral of golden rectangles contained within each other.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It is a ''logarithmic'' curve of ''continuous growth.'' Any two segments of the curve are the same shape; they are just different sizes. As a snail grows, it produces shell material in the same formation, only in larger quantities. Similar curves lie in the center of a sunflower, in the shape of a fir cone and in other natural forms that contain the golden ratio.\n\nThe golden ratio provides some insight into the ways in which mathematics works in general. Nature might provide the original model for speculation about the ratio. From observation of a pine cone, a snail's shell, a sunflower, certain similarities are noted and an abstraction is made. This abstraction - a proportion, in this case - is itself studied, revealing other properties. Underlying principles are then recognized in different realms - the golden rectangle, the properties of number, the arts; related structures are found at the foundation of seemingly disparate systems. Mathematical thought processes, of course, are vastly more complex, but they are quite similar in essence.\n\nMusic also involves this type of analytical thinking. It too begins in the natural world - with physical laws and bodily rhythms. Music, like mathematics, then creates abstract systems, like tonality, for its activities. Within such a system, a musical ''element,'' a theme, may be explored, transformed, revealed in different musical contexts. Its rhythm may be isolated. Its intervallic structure may be considered, its harmonic implications examined. When, for example, at the end of a Bach fugue, the theme enters in a cadence, it carries meanings it did not have when first heard. Like a mathematical object, that theme has been explored in various combinations; it has been inverted, expanded, viewed in differing contexts, dissected. A sort of musical knowledge has been achieved. There is a similar sense in Beethoven's piano sonatas that a concentrated exploration of musical elements is taking place before one's ears; when a theme returns in a recapitulation, it is no longer heard as it was in the beginning. In this manipulation of abstract material, which reveals new relations and structures, math and music may have their common formal ground.\n\nBut these processes in math and music also suggest an esthetic that has been central in the West and implicit in the golden ratio. This concept of beauty involves proportion between various elements and a relation between parts and whole - a reproduction of macrocosm in microcosm.\n\nIn music, to give an unusual example, Bartok's interest in such ideas was so strong that he literally reproduced the golden ratio in his compositions. In ''Bela Bartok; An Analysis of his Music,'' the Hungarian musicologist Erno Lendvai demonstrates that in Bartok's music, crucial musical events mark divisions and subdivisions of the work into golden sections. Bartok's unusual harmonic system, Mr. Lendvai argues, is also related to the golden ratio.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut even when parallels are less precise, music often involves a similar esthetic. The classical sonata had an organic character, with musical elements exfoliating into a drama. Heinrich Schenker, this century's most original musicologist, wrote about the ''biological nature of form'' in tonal music and demonstrated how properties of a single phrase are repeated throughout a work and shape its structure. Many composers of ''advanced'' serial music have had similar esthetic ambitions, working outside the tonal system.\n\nThe ideals of mathematics also, of course, include such coherence and proportion. But there is even an esthetic aspect to the process of mathematical activity. It is not simply a search for the ''right'' answers. There are ''styles'' of doing mathematics. A proof can have its own form, its own ''tempo'' in the way it introduces concepts or transforms interpretations or rhythmically follows set rules. Different methods can reveal different -and sometimes surprising - aspects of a problem, pointing out new relations and orders.\n\nThat sort of unexpected insight, to give a simple example, was demonstrated by the mathematician Gauss when he was seven years old. He was asked to give the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100. Instead of laboriously adding them he noticed that in grouping 1 and 100, 2 and 99, 3 and 98, 4 and 97, etc., each pair added to 101. The series from 1 to 100 could be ordered to create 50 such combinations. Thus, the sum of the numbers was 50 x 101. This reordering of the sum is a ''beautiful'' method - surprising, witty, powerful; it provides a glimpse into the universal properties of a series.\n\nIn great mathematics, Hardy wrote, ''there is a very high degree of unexpectedness, combined with inevitability and economy.'' Those are, of course, also the properties of great music. A more profound counterpart to Gauss's solution, for example, is in Beethoven's Diabelli Variations. Instead of customarily varying the banal waltz, the composer considers it in radically different lights. By focusing on an accent, perhaps, instead of on the melodic line, he reorders the music's priorities, revealing a new way of hearing familiar patterns. He transforms the waltz with surprise, wit and power while revealing general properties of musical structure.\n\nWhat is unexpected about such music, and about similarly deep mathematical work, is its revelation - a new vision of the order of things. What is inevitable, is that, somehow, things could not have been any different; such work seems to make an irrefutable statement about the world.\n\nBut the unexpectedness and inevitability of such math and music are powerful because they are not merely formal; they ultimately reflect back to the real world. Music has a concrete emotional meaning, with the capacity to change a listener's feelings. Math also has a concrete meaning; the most abstract brain-spun explorations in mathematics have what one physicist called ''unreasonable effectiveness'' in describing the world. In such a reordered understanding of reality, which seems both surprising and necessary, may lie some qualities of beauty itself.\n\nStravinsky said that the musician should find in mathematics a study ''as useful to him as the learning of another language is to a poet.'' Such knowledge carries the danger - as in much of the musical theory of the 1950's and 60's - of a false ''scientism.'' But right now there seems to be a return to more fundamental questions in musico-mathematical discussion. Some computer researchers are systematically investigating how music is comprehended. In some strains of today's ''avant-garde,'' mathematics is used in service of a sort of Pythagorean mysticism and applied to very basic properties of music. There have been experiments in vocal overtones, in tuning the piano to create perfect consonances, in extracting elemental characteristics from ''natural'' folk musics.\n\nWhatever the particular styles or esthetics are, though, music and math are unmistakably linked. When I worked at learning at a Beethoven Sonata while also trying to understand the Godel Incompleteness Theorem, the affinity between these activities was evident. Both mathematics and music create languages that have compelling force in shaping understanding and feeling. Both are attempts to make sense of things, to shape esthetic universes that bear directly upon our own. John William Navin Sullivan - author of both a biography of Newton and a monograph on Beethoven - put it this way: ''Mathematics, as much as music or any other art, is one of the means by which we rise to a complete self-consciousness.''\n\nStravinsky, in discussing ''the art of combination which is composition'' quoted the mathematician Marston Morse: ''Mathematics are the result of mysterious powers which no one understands, and in which the unconscious recognition of beauty must play an important part. Out of an infinity of designs a mathematician chooses one pattern for beauty's sake and pulls it down to earth.'' Morse, Stravinsky says, could as well have been talking about music. It is not only in the clarity of things, but in their beauty and mystery that the two arts join."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": null, "title": "'SNL' Takes Aim at the Midterm Elections and Jeff Bezos - New York Times", "description": "New York Times 'SNL' Takes Aim at the Midterm Elections and Jeff Bezos New York Times Would this be the week that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d finally got out from underneath its own soap opera and turned its full attention to the world beyond Studio 8H?

But there are some things that I think he will have to discover.\u201d\n\nTackling the state\u2019s election laws is a possibility, given the weaknesses in the system exposed by the roller coaster of a recount."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": null, "title": "White Kansas Official's 'Master Race' Comment Draws Calls for His Resignation - New York Times", "description": "New York Times White Kansas Official's 'Master Race' Comment Draws Calls for His Resignation New York Times The governor of Kansas is among several officials calling for a white county commissioner to resign after he used the term \u201cmaster race\u201d while addressi\u2026", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/17/us/kansas-official-master-race.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/autossell/18xpKansas/merlin_146899977_4bac9518-46f3-47e6-8dde-0034b6a2cb95-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T00:20:20Z", "content": "In November 2017, when the commission was approving a holiday calendar, Mr. Klemp began a monologue during which he lamented that some historical figures were not honored anymore because they once owned slaves.

Lee, the commander of the Confederate Army, a \u201cwonderful part of history\u201d and questioned why Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday should be recognized when there was not a similar day for George Washington. At that same meeting, he later acknowledged the existence of Presidents\u2019 Day.\n\nMr. Klemp also said no one would understand Lincoln\u2019s historical importance because the Confederacy did not win the Civil War, \u201cwhich is all good, I guess.\u201d\n\nDuring the discussion about the holidays, he looked at a calendar in front of him and said: \u201cI didn\u2019t see Oprah on there. No, she\u2019s not on there as a federal holiday.\u201d\n\nMr. Preisinger said the \u201cmaster race\u201d remark was the last straw for many people. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a stain on our community.\u201d\n\nMr. Klemp was not elected to his post but chosen by members of the county Republican Party after the previous commissioner resigned because he was ill, said Rett Rogers, the party\u2019s chairman. Mr. Rogers said Mr. Klemp was voted into the position last year by one vote.\n\nMr. Rogers did not cast his vote for Mr. Klemp \u2014 his wife was also in the running \u2014 but he said he preferred that Mr. Klemp not resign because his term is ending in January.\n\nHe said Mr. Klemp\u2019s recent remark seemed to be intended as a joke. \u201cThat was taken in a completely different way,\u201d he said."}]
