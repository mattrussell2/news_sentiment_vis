Maybe part of it is that there\u2019s something deeply laid back about the Australian accent.

They are ranked 28th in the N.F.L. in scoring offense but they have a winning record thanks to a defense that suffocates its opponents and an offense that slows things down and chews up the clock. Sure, they took a brief foray into more typical dominance last week, crushing the Patriots, 34-10, but their average game score, 18.7-16.8, means fewer total points have been scored in their games this season (319) than the Saints, the Rams and the Chiefs have each scored themselves.

Steve Kornacki\u2019s \u201cThe Red and the Blue: The 1990s and the Birth of Political Tribalism\u201d renders such an experience lively and fulfilling, if not uplifting, by making a mostly convincing case that the brutal 1990s political battles led by Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich had brought the country to its stark divide between \u201cred America\u201d and \u201cblue America\u201d by election night, 2000.\n\nOrganized around searing episodes that defined the decade, the book alternately follows Clinton and Gingrich, starting even before 1990. It traces their early political rises, dwelling on the Democrats\u2019 post-Walter Mondale fissures through which Clinton emerged and describing Gingrich\u2019s initial attacks on the House of Representatives\u2019 polite procedures. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a much tougher and a much more militant Republican Party,\u201d Gingrich said after one 1985 fight, once his colleagues embraced his confrontational strategy. \u201cI think it changes permanently the nature of the Republican Party of the House.\u201d Kornacki, an NBC News and MSNBC national political correspondent, appears to agree.\n\nImage\n\nKornacki, who treats the Republicans\u2019 1990 clash over raising taxes as an inflection point, may focus on Clinton and Gingrich\u2019s well-known battles, but he sprinkles in enough about other characters \u2014 among them Pat Buchanan, Jesse Jackson and Al D\u2019Amato \u2014 to keep the story line going. He suggests the growing difference between right and left can be explained early on by huge conflagrations like Clinton\u2019s scandals and Buchanan\u2019s culture war, but also by short-term political dust-ups like Zo\u00eb Baird\u2019s ill-fated 1993 attorney general nomination. Published just as the political world reckons with the results of the 2018 midterm elections, Kornacki\u2019s book is full of what can be read as nods to today, including its references to Hillary Clinton and its resonant descriptions of Ross Perot, who comes across as a kind of proto-Trump."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "BILL FRISKICS-WARREN", "title": "Roy Clark Is Dead at 85; a Face of Country Music on \u2018Hee Haw\u2019", "description": "Roy Clark, right, performing with Roy Acuff during a taping of the syndicated television show \u201cHee Haw\u201d in 1983.

Don, highly accomplished and educated \u2014 he\u2019s \u201cDr. Shirley\u201d to most, \u201cDoc\u201d to Tony \u2014 is formal and fastidious, an aesthete and an intellectual with no patience for vulgarity or sloppiness.

Yeah, they\u2019re maybe sad because Bob is walking out with a cardboard box. But really they\u2019re asking: Is this systemic? Is the company in trouble?

They have to eat their daily four pounds of Chipotle or they get fussy by 3:30 p.m.\n\nSlack it to Me, Kiddo\n\nMy company has been using Slack for a couple years now. At first it was slightly annoying to have one more thing to monitor, but it did replace some unwieldy email threads. It was a marginally useful piece of software. But at some point Slack became something more complicated. Certain people in the office clearly established themselves as being \u201cgood at Slack.\u201d I don\u2019t mean they used emojis and GIFs well. They were good at a kind of quick-twitch banter that I simply cannot keep up with. I\u2019m not an old person (I\u2019m 35), I\u2019m just not good at instantly being clever in a chat window at work. Recently, some people got promoted and I\u2019m convinced a large part of it was this maddening new \u201cskill.\u201d How do I get \u201cgood at Slack,\u201d or whatever comes next? Am I seriously going to have a worse career because of this?\n\n\u2014 Brooklyn Heights\n\nBecause people who run the tools at companies are not usually the same people who run the culture of companies, and because people who are more senior are generally also locked in senseless endless meetings all day, the adoption of Slack in offices is extremely haphazard and hazardous. Communities of people begin working in different ways in the same workplace. Messy! Some of us Gen Xers and many (most?) millennials grew up chatting online all day, every day, and we have taken to Slack perhaps too enthusiastically, we know. You email people will never be like us!

Oh, and a company that uses robots to make pizza. You wonder why there\u2019s a tech backlash.\u201d\n\nActually no one wonders that anymore, which is why it\u2019s probably time to think about where the industry goes from here. While I can be hard on tech, I still have hope that it can regain its innovation, inspiration and sunny approach to the future.\n\nTo do this, I have five suggestions:\n\nEmbrace Transparency\n\nAs seen in the Facebook mess, the biggest error of all is the slow dribbling out, and outright covering up, of bad news. There is no greater threat to innovation than this kind of behavior, which suggests a company that wants to hold on to its power rather than be honest about its faults. Google has also failed to be transparent enough in regard to its creation of a search engine in China, its payoffs to men accused of sexual harassment and its work with the Defense Department. At Twitter, it is still unclear how it makes decisions about the removal of hateful content on its platform. And it sure would be nice if Uber would release the full Eric Holder report on how that company behaved or, more precisely, misbehaved.\n\nHold Leaders Accountable\n\nThe fact that no one seems to get fired for anything at these companies is really quite breathtaking. Techies are fond of the obviously false bromide that failure is O.K. If it is so fine, one wonders why no one is being held publicly responsible for anything, aside from the tiresome apology tours that are on replay in Silicon Valley. Privacy breaches at Yahoo and Facebook and Google and everywhere? So sorry. Payoffs to alleged sexual harassers all over the system? So sorry. Questionable financing? So sorry. Yeah, I am sorry that they are so sorry, too, but actions should follow words.\n\nAvoid Groupthink\n\nIn early 2017 at an event in Germany, I asked Elliot Schrage, then Facebook\u2019s top policy and communications executive \u2014 who also stars in the Times article \u2014 if there were any \u201cirritants\u201d among the company\u2019s managers. By this, I was asking if there was a consistent effort to bring out the concerns and worries of staff members and to introduce doubt about the company\u2019s products and efforts. He never answered and I knew the answer anyway: Facebook\u2019s ruling class pushed cohesion over disagreement and chastised those who went against the grain. Witness the experience of Alex Stamos, the company\u2019s security chief, who was apparently yelled at for how he moved forward with exploring his early worries about Russian interference, rather than celebrated for what he unearthed.\n\nInvest in Diversity\n\nTech companies\u2019 record on diversity is just abysmal and has not budged in years, despite all the promises. They need to increase diversity because it is the right thing to do. But numerous studies have also proven that a heterogeneous staff \u2014 including differences in age, gender, race and background \u2014 is the best thing for businesses in the long term. Does it happen? It does not.

A little farther along the road, a herd of bison swung their great heads as they rooted for food in the sagebrush steppe, their deep rumbles clear in the quiet, cold air.\n\nIn the United States, Yellowstone National Park is the only place bison and wolves can be seen in great numbers. Because of the park, these animals survive. Yellowstone was crucial to bringing back bison, reintroducing gray wolves, and restoring trumpeter swans, elk, and grizzly bears \u2014 all five species driven toward extinction found refuge here.\n\nBison in Yellowstone.\n\nBut the Yellowstone of charismatic megafauna and of stunning geysers that four million visitors a year travel to see is changing before the eyes of those who know it best. Researchers who have spent years studying, managing, and exploring its roughly 3,400 square miles say that soon the landscape may look dramatically different.\n\nOver the next few decades of climate change, the country\u2019s first national park will quite likely see increased fire, less forest, expanding grasslands, shallower, warmer waterways, and more invasive plants \u2014 all of which may alter how, and how many, animals move through the landscape. Ecosystems are always in flux, but climate change is transforming habitats so quickly that many plants and animals may not be able to adapt well or at all.\n\nYellowstone National Park, established in 1872, is one of the Unesco World Heritage sites threatened by climate change. It is home to some of the country\u2019s oldest weather stations, including one at Mammoth Hot Springs. Data from the park and surrounding area has helped scientists understand and track climate change in the Western United States.\n\nSince 1948, the average annual temperature in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem \u2014 an area of 34,375 square miles that includes the park, national forests, and Grand Teton National Park \u2014 has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Researchers report that winter is, on balance, 10 days shorter and less cold.\n\nAt the northeast entrance, for example, about 60 fewer days fall below freezing than did 30 years ago. The snow that blankets the park each winter is a vital part of the Yellowstone ecosystem. But the snow often doesn\u2019t stay as long, or accumulate the way it used to. Inches of water trapped as snow No Change -2 in. -4 in. or more Colors show projected decrease in snowpack compared to current averages. By mid-century, scientists predict that the snowpack in some areas of the park will decrease sharply.\n\n\u201cFor the Northern Rockies, snowpack has fallen to its lowest level in eight centuries,\u201d said Patrick Gonzalez, a forest and climate change scientist at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nBecause snow is a cornerstone of the park\u2019s ecology, the decline is alarming to some ecologists.\n\nThe Grand Prismatic Spring.\n\nSummers in the park have become warmer, drier and increasingly prone to fire. Even if rainfall increases in the future, it will evaporate more quickly, said Michael Tercek, an ecologist who has worked in Yellowstone for 28 years.\n\n\u201cBy the time my daughter is an old woman, the climate will be as different for her as the last ice age seems to us,\u201d Dr. Tercek said.\n\nYellowstone\u2019s unusual landscape \u2014 of snow and steam, of cold streams and hot springs \u2014 is volcanic. Magma gives rise to boiling water and multihued thermophiles, bacteria that thrive at high temperatures.\n\nThe Grand Prismatic Spring from above.\n\nIn 1883, The New York Times described the park as an \u201calmost mystical wonderland.\u201d\n\nFor many visitors, Yellowstone represents American wilderness: a place with big, open skies where antelope and bison still roam.\n\n\u201cYou run into visitors and they thank you for the place,\u201d said Ann Rodman, a park scientist. \u201cThey are seeing elk and antelope for the first time in their lives.\u201d\n\nAn elk at Mammoth Hot Springs.\n\nMs. Rodman, who has been working in Yellowstone for 30 years, has pored over temperature and weather data. The trends surprised her, as well as the urgency.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started doing it, I really thought climate change was something that was going to happen to us in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is one of those things where the more you study it, the more you realize how much is changing and how fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you begin to go through this stage, I don\u2019t know if it is like the stages of grief,\u201d Ms. Rodman said. \u201cAll of a sudden it hits you that this is a really, really big deal and we aren\u2019t really talking about it and we aren\u2019t really thinking about it.\u201d\n\nAnn Rodman, a scientist at Yellowstone.\n\nMs. Rodman has seen vast changes near the town of Gardiner, Mont., at the north entrance to Yellowstone. Some non-nutritious invasive plants like cheatgrass and desert madwort have replaced nutritious native plants. Those changes worry Ms. Rodman and others: Give invasives an inch and they take miles.\n\nCheatgrass has already spread into the Lamar Valley. \u201cThis is what we don\u2019t want \u2014 to turn into what it looks like in Gardiner,\u201d Ms. Rodman said. \u201cThe seeds come in on people\u2019s cars and on people\u2019s boots.\u201d\n\nPronghorn antelope, with cheatgrass in the background.\n\nCheatgrass can thrive in disturbed soils and can ignite \u201clike tissue paper,\u201d she said. It takes hold after fires, preventing native plants from regrowing.\n\nIf cheatgrass and its ilk spread, bison and elk could be affected. Cheatgrass, for instance, grows quickly in the spring. \u201cIt can suck the moisture out of the ground early,\u201d Ms. Rodman said. \u201cThen it is gone, so it doesn\u2019t sustain animals throughout the summer the way native grasses would.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, elk have lost forage when drier, hotter summers have shortened what ecologists call the green wave, in which plants become green at different times at different elevations, said Andrew J. Hansen of Montana State University.\n\nDrier summers can mean less food for grazing. Elk leave the park to forage on private land. Migration patterns are already changing.\n\nSome elk now stay in valleys outside the park, nibbling lawns and alfalfa fields, Dr. Hansen said. And where they go, wolves follow. \u201cIt is a very interesting mix of land-use change and climate change, possibly leading to quite dramatic shifts in migration and to thousands of elk on private land,\u201d he said.\n\nDrier summers also mean that fires are a greater threat. The conditions that gave rise to the fires of 1988, when a third of the park burned, could become common.\n\nBy the end of the century, \u201cthe weather like the summer of \u201988 will likely be there all the time rather than being the very rare exception,\u201d said Monica G. Turner of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAs the climate is warming, we are getting fires that are happening more often. We are starting to have the young forests burn again before they have had a chance to recover.\u201d\n\nEvergreen forest damaged by bark beetles. Trees, and new growth, after a forest fire.\n\nIn 2016, a wildfire swept through trees in a section near the Madison River that had burned in 1988. Because young trees don\u2019t have many cones on them, Dr. Turner said, they don\u2019t have as many seeds to release to form new forest. The cones they do have are close to the ground, which means they are less likely to survive the heat.\n\nRepeated fires could lead to more grassland. \u201cThe structure of the forests is going to change,\u201d Dr. Turner said. \u201cThey might become sparse or not recover if we keep doing a double and triple whammy.\u201d\n\nForests shade waterways, and those too are experiencing climate-related changes. \u201cWe can very definitely see warming trends during the summer and fall,\u201d said Daniel J. Isaak of the United States Forest Service. \u201cStream and river flows are declining as snowpack declines.\u201d As fish become concentrated in smaller areas, Dr. Isaak said, disease can increase in a population because transmission is easier.\n\nSour Creek.\n\nIn 2016, the Yellowstone River \u2014 famous for its fly fishing and its cutthroat trout, which thrive in colder waters \u2014 was closed to anglers for 183 miles downstream from the park after an outbreak of kidney disease killed thousands of fish. \u201cThe feeling was that this was a canary in the coal mine,\u201d said Dan Vermillion of Sweetwater Travel Company, a fly-fishing operation in Livingston, Mont.\n\nLower flows and warmer water are one consequence of spring arriving earlier. Quickly melting snow unleashing torrents is another. Flooding has affected the nesting of water birds like common loons, American white pelicans, and double-crested cormorants. \u201cAll their nesting is on lakes and ponds, and water levels are fluctuating wildly, as it does with climate change,\u201d said Douglas W. Smith, a park biologist.\n\nFishing for trout in the Gardner River.\n\nAnd Yellowstone\u2019s trumpeter swans are declining. By the early 20th century, hunters had wiped out most of the enormous birds in the continental United States, killing them for food and fashionable feathers. But 70 or so swans remained in the Yellowstone region, some of them safe inside the park. Those birds helped restore trumpeters nationwide. Now only two trumpeter pairs live in the park, and they have not bred successfully for several years.\n\nPart of the reason, said Dr. Smith and a colleague, Lauren E. Walker, may be the loss of nests and nesting sites during spring floods. A pair on Swan Lake, just south of Mammoth Hot Springs, has spurned the floating nest that the Park Service installed to help the birds.\n\n\u201cHeritage-wise this is a really important population,\u201d Dr. Walker said. \u201cIf this is no longer a reliable spot, what does that mean for the places that may have more human disturbance?\u201d\n\nOn the shores of Yellowstone Lake, dozens of late-season visitors watched two grizzly bears eating a carcass, while a coyote and some ravens circled, just a hundred or so yards from the road. \u201cIf they run this way,\u201d the ranger called out, \u201cget in your cars.\u201d\n\nGrizzlies are omnivores, eating whatever is available, including the fat- and protein-packed nuts of the whitebark pine. That pine is perhaps the species most visibly affected by climate change in Yellowstone and throughout the West. Warmer temperatures have allowed a native pest, the mountain pine beetle, to better survive winter, move into high elevations and have a longer reproductive season. In the last 30 years, an estimated 80 percent of the whitebark pines in the park have died by fire, beetle, or fungal infection.\n\nA grizzly bear in Yellowstone.\n\nFor want of the whitebark pine, a great deal could be lost. The trees are a foundation species, meaning they play a central role in the structure of the ecosystem. They colonize exposed mountain sites, allowing other plants to get a root-hold. Their wide canopies protect snowpack from the sun. They are also a keystone species. They provide food for birds like the Clark\u2019s nutcracker, which, in turn, create whitebark pine nurseries by caching nuts. And they are an important food source for squirrels, foxes, and grizzlies.\n\nWhen pine nuts are not plentiful, bears consume other foods, including the elk or deer innards left by hunters outside the park. And that can bring the Yellowstone-area grizzlies, relisted as threatened this September, into conflict with people.\n\nThe loss of the pines \u201chas far-reaching implications for the entire ecosystem,\u201d said Jesse A. Logan, a retired Forest Service researcher.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the landscape, even in the mountainous West, has been so altered that Yellowstone becomes even more important,\u201d Dr. Logan said.\n\nYellowstone provides a refuge for people seeking and delighting in a sense of wilderness. It offers a landscape unlike any other: a largely intact ecosystem rich in wildlife and rich in geothermal features. Yellowstone\u2019s unusual beauty was forged by volcanic heat; heat from humanity could be its undoing.\n\n\u201cPeople think of Yellowstone as representing wildness because it does,\u201d Dr. Logan said. \u201cThis is kind of the last wild place.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "KURT STREETER", "title": "Talent.

Louis in 1991 when he stumbled across one of the most important discoveries of modern brain science. For Buckner \u2014 as for many of his peers during the early \u201990s \u2014 the discovery was so counterintuitive that it took years to recognize its significance.\n\nBuckner\u2019s lab, run by the neuroscientists Marcus Raichle and Steven Petersen, was exploring what the new technology of PET scanning could show about the connection between language and memory in the human brain. The promise of the PET machine lay in how it measured blood flow to different parts of the brain, allowing researchers for the first time to see detailed neural activity, not just anatomy. In Buckner\u2019s study, the subjects were asked to recall words from a memorized list; by tracking where the brain was consuming the most energy during the task, Buckner and his colleagues hoped to understand which parts of the brain were engaged in that kind of memory.\n\nBut there was a catch. Different regions of the brain vary widely in how much energy they consume no matter what the brain is doing; if you ask someone to do mental math while scanning her brain in a PET machine, you won\u2019t learn anything from that scan on its own, because the subtle changes that reflect the mental math task will be drowned out by the broader patterns of blood flow throughout the brain. To see the specific regions activated by a specific task, researchers needed a baseline comparison, a control.\n\nAt first, this seemed simple enough: Put the subjects in the PET scanner, ask them to sit there and do nothing \u2014 what the researchers sometimes called a resting state \u2014 and then ask them to perform the task under study. The assumption was that by comparing the two images, the resting brain and the active brain, the researchers could discern which regions were consuming more energy while performing the task.\n\nBut something went strangely wrong when Buckner scanned the resting states of their subjects. \u201cWhat happened is that we began putting people in scanners that can measure their brain activity,\u201d Buckner recalls now, \u201cand Mother Nature shouted back at us.\u201d When people were told to sit and do nothing, the PET scans showed a distinct surge of mental energy in some regions. The resting state turned out to be more active than the active state.\n\nThe odd blast of activity during the resting state would be observed in dozens of other studies using a similar control structure during this period. To this first generation of scientists using PET scans, the active rest state was viewed, in Buckner\u2019s words, as \u201ca confound, as troublesome.\u201d A confound is an errant variable that prevents a scientist from doing a proper control study. It\u2019s noise, mere interference getting in the way of the signal that science is looking for. Buckner and his colleagues noted the strange activity in a paper submitted in 1993, but almost as an afterthought, or an apology.\n\nBut that passing nod to the strangely active \u201cresting state\u201d turned out to be one of the first hints of what would become a revolution in our understanding of human intelligence. Not long after Buckner\u2019s paper was published, a brain scientist at the University of Iowa named Nancy Andreasen decided to invert the task/control structure that had dominated the early neuroimaging studies. Instead of battling the \u201ctroublesome\u201d resting state, Andreasen and her team would make it the focus of their study.\n\nAndreasen\u2019s background outside neuroscience might have helped her perceive the value lurking in the rest state, where her peers saw only trouble. As a professor of Renaissance literature, she published a scholarly appraisal of John Donne\u2019s \u201cconservative revolutionary\u201d poetics. After switching fields in her 30s, she eventually began exploring the mystery of creativity through the lens of brain imaging. \u201cAlthough neither a Freudian nor a psychoanalyst, I knew enough about human mental activity to quickly perceive what a foolish \u2018control task\u2019 rest was,\u201d she would later write. \u201cMost investigators made the convenient assumption that the brain would be blank or neutral during \u2018rest.\u2019 From introspection I knew that my own brain is often at its most active when I stretch out on a bed or sofa and close my eyes.\u201d\n\nAndreasen\u2019s study, the results of which were eventually published in The American Journal of Psychiatry in 1995, included a subtle dig at the way the existing community had demoted this state to a baseline control: She called this mode the REST state, for Random Episodic Silent Thought. The surge of activity that the PET scans revealed was not a confound, Andreasen argued. It was a clue. In our resting states, we do not rest. Left to its own devices, the human brain resorts to one of its most emblematic tricks, maybe one that helped make us human in the first place.\n\nIt time-travels.\n\nImagine it\u2019s late evening on a workday and you\u2019re taking your dog for a walk before bedtime. A few dozen paces from your front door, as you settle into your usual route through the neighborhood, your mind wanders to an important meeting scheduled for next week. You picture it going well \u2014 there\u2019s a subtle rush of anticipatory pleasure as you imagine the scene \u2014 and you allow yourself to hope that this might set the stage for you to ask your boss for a raise. Not right away, mind you, but maybe in a few months. You imagine her saying yes, and what that salary bump would mean: Next year, you and your spouse might finally be able to get out of the rental market and buy a house in a nicer neighborhood nearby, the one with the better school district. But then your mind shifts to a problem you\u2019ve been wrestling with lately: A member of your team is brilliant but temperamental. His emotional swings can be explosive; just today, perceiving a slight from a colleague, he started berating her in the middle of a meeting. He seems to have no sense of decorum, no ability to rein in his emotions.\n\nAs you walk, you remember the physical sense of unease in the room as your colleague ranted over the most meaningless offense. You imagine a meeting six months from now with a comparable eruption \u2014 only this time it\u2019s happening in front of your boss. A small wave of stress washes over you. Perhaps he\u2019s just not the right fit for the job, you think \u2014 which reminds you of the one time you fired an employee, five years ago. Your mind conjures the awkward intensity of that conversation, and then imagines how much more explosive a comparable conversation would be with your current employee. You feel a sensation close to physical fear as your mind runs through the scenario.\n\nIn just a few minutes of mental wandering, you have made several distinct round trips from past to future: forward a week to the important meeting, forward a year or more to the house in the new neighborhood, backward five hours to today\u2019s meeting, forward six months, backward five years, forward a few weeks. You\u2019ve built chains of cause and effect connecting those different moments; you\u2019ve moved seamlessly from actual events to imagined ones. And as you\u2019ve navigated through time, your brain and body\u2019s emotional system has generated distinct responses to each situation, real and imagined. The whole sequence is a master class in temporal gymnastics. In these moments of unstructured thinking, our minds dart back and forth between past and future, like a film editor scrubbing through the frames of a movie.\n\nThe sequence of thoughts does not feel, subjectively, like hard work. It does not seem to require mental effort; the scenarios just flow out of your mind. Because these imagined futures come so easily to us, we have long underestimated the significance of the skill. The PET scanner allowed us to appreciate, for the first time, just how complex this kind of cognitive time travel actually is.\n\nIn her 1995 paper, Nancy Andreasen included two key observations that would grow in significance over the subsequent decades. When she interviewed the subjects afterward, they described their mental activity during the REST state as a kind of effortless shifting back and forth in time. \u201cThey think freely about a variety of things,\u201d Andreasen wrote, \u201cespecially events of the past few days or future activities of the current or next several days.\u201d Perhaps most intriguing, Andreasen noted that most of the REST activity took place in what are called the association cortices of the brain, the regions of the brain that are most pronounced in Homo sapiens compared with other primates and that are often the last to become fully operational as the human brain develops through adolescence and early adulthood. \u201cApparently, when the brain/mind thinks in a free and unencumbered fashion,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit uses its most human and complex parts.\u201d\n\nIn the years that followed Andreasen\u2019s pioneering work, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a series of studies and papers mapped out the network of brain activity that she first identified. In 2001, Randy Buckner\u2019s adviser at Washington University, Marcus Raichle, coined a new term for the phenomenon: the \u201cdefault-mode network,\u201d or just \u201cthe default network.\u201d The phrase stuck. Today, Google Scholar lists thousands of academic studies that have investigated the default network. \u201cIt looks to me like this is the most important discovery of cognitive neuroscience,\u201d says the University of Pennsylvania psychologist Martin Seligman. The seemingly trivial activity of mind-wandering is now believed to play a central role in the brain\u2019s \u201cdeep learning,\u201d the mind\u2019s sifting through past experiences, imagining future prospects and assessing them with emotional judgments: that flash of shame or pride or anxiety that each scenario elicits.\n\nA growing number of scholars, drawn from a wide swath of disciplines \u2014 neuroscience, philosophy, computer science \u2014 now argue that this aptitude for cognitive time travel, revealed by the discovery of the default network, may be the defining property of human intelligence. \u201cWhat best distinguishes our species,\u201d Seligman wrote in a Times Op-Ed with John Tierney, \u201cis an ability that scientists are just beginning to appreciate: We contemplate the future.\u201d He went on: \u201cA more apt name for our species would be Homo prospectus, because we thrive by considering our prospects. The power of prospection is what makes us wise.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether nonhuman animals have any real concept of the future at all. Some organisms display behavior that has long-term consequences, like a squirrel\u2019s burying a nut for winter, but those behaviors are all instinctive. The latest studies of animal cognition suggest that some primates and birds may carry out deliberate preparations for events that will occur in the near future. But making decisions based on future prospects on the scale of months or years \u2014 even something as simple as planning a gathering of the tribe a week from now \u2014 would be unimaginable even to our closest primate relatives. If the Homo prospectus theory is correct, those limited time-traveling skills explain an important piece of the technological gap that separates humans from all other species on the planet. It\u2019s a lot easier to invent a new tool if you can imagine a future where that tool might be useful. What gave flight to the human mind and all its inventiveness may not have been the usual culprits of our opposable thumbs or our gift for language. It may, instead, have been freeing our minds from the tyranny of the present.\n\nThe capacity for prospection has been reflected in, and amplified by, many of the social and scientific revolutions that shaped human history. Agriculture itself would have been unimaginable without a working model of the future: predicting seasonal changes, visualizing the long-term improvements possible from domesticating crops. Banking and credit systems require minds capable of sacrificing present-tense value for the possibility of greater gains in the future. For vaccines to work, we needed patients willing to introduce a potential pathogen into their bodies for a lifetime of protection against disease. We are born with a singular gift for imagining the future, but we have been enhancing those gifts since the dawn of civilization. Today, new enhancements are on the horizon, in the form of machine-learning algorithms that already outperform humans at certain kinds of forecasts. As A.I. stands poised to augment our most essential human talent, we are faced with a curious question: How will the future be different if we get much better at predicting it?\n\n\u201cTime travel feels like an ancient tradition, rooted in old mythologies, old as gods and dragons,\u201d James Gleick observes in his 2017 book, \u201cTime Travel: A History.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t. Though the ancients imagined immortality and rebirth and lands of the dead, time machines were beyond their ken. Time travel is a fantasy of the modern era.\u201d The idea of using technology to move through time as effortlessly as we move through space appears to have been first conceived by H.G. Wells at the end of the 19th century, eventually showcased in his pioneering work of science fiction, \u201cThe Time Machine.\u201d\n\nBut machines have been soothsayers from the beginning. In 1900, sponge divers stranded after a storm in the Mediterranean discovered an underwater statuary on the shoals of the Greek island Antikythera. It turned out to be the wreck of a ship more than 2,000 years old. During the subsequent salvage operation, divers recovered the remnants of a puzzling clocklike contraption with precision-cut gears, annotated with cryptic symbols that were corroded beyond recognition. For years, the device lay unnoticed in a museum drawer, until a British historian named Derek de Solla Price rediscovered it in the early 1950s and began the laborious process of reconstructing it \u2014 an effort that scholars have continued into the 21st century. We now know that the device was capable of predicting the behavior of the sun, the moon and five of the planets. The device was so advanced that it could even predict, with meaningful accuracy, solar or lunar eclipses that wouldn\u2019t occur for decades.\n\nThe Antikythera mechanism, as it has come to be known, is sometimes referred to as an ancient computer. The analogy is misleading: The underlying technology behind the device was much closer to a clock than a programmable computer. But at its essence, it was a prediction machine. A clock is there to tell you about the present. The mechanism was there to tell you about the future. That its creators went to such great lengths to predict eclipses seems telling: While some ancient societies did believe that eclipses harmed crops, knowing about them in advance wouldn\u2019t have been of much use. What seems far more useful is the sense of magic and wonder that such a prediction could provide, and the power that could be acquired as a result. Imagine standing in front of the masses and announcing that tomorrow the sun will transform for more than a minute into a fire-tinged black orb. Then imagine the awe when the prophecy comes true.\n\nPrediction machines have only multiplied since the days of the ancient Greeks. Where those original clockwork devices dealt with deterministic futures, like the motions of solar bodies, increasingly our time-traveling tools forecast probabilities and likelihoods, allowing us to imagine possible futures for more complex systems. In the late 1600s, thanks to improvements in public-health records and mathematical advances in statistics, the British astronomer Edmund Halley and the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens separately made the first rigorous estimates of average life expectancy. Around the same time, there was an explosion of insurance companies, their business made possible by this newfound ability to predict future risk. Initially, they focused on the commercial risk of new shipping ventures, but eventually insurance would come to offer protection against just about every future threat imaginable: fire, floods, disease. In the 20th century, randomized, controlled trials allowed us to predict the future effects of medical interventions, finally separating out the genuine cures from the snake oil. In the digital age, spreadsheet software took accounting tools that were originally designed to record the past activity of a business and transformed them into tools for projecting out forecasts, letting us click through alternate financial scenarios in much the way our minds wander through various possible futures.\n\nBut cognitive time travel has been enhanced by more than just science and technology. The invention of storytelling itself can be seen as a kind of augmentation of the default network\u2019s gift for time travel. Stories do not just allow us to conjure imaginary worlds; they also free us from being mired in linear time. Analepsis and prolepsis \u2014 flashbacks and flash-forwards \u2014 constitute some of the oldest literary devices in the canon, deployed in ancient narratives like the \u201cOdyssey\u201d and the \u201cArabian Nights.\u201d Time machines have obviously proliferated in the content of sci-fi narratives since \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d was published, but time travel has also infiltrated the form of modern storytelling. A defining trick of recent popular narrative is the contorted timeline, with movies and TV shows embracing temporal schemes that would have baffled mainstream audiences just a few decades ago. The epic, often inscrutable plot of the TV show \u201cLost\u201d veered among past, present and future with a reckless glee. The blockbuster 2016 movie \u201cArrival\u201d featured a bewildering time scheme that skipped forward more than 50 times to future events, while intimating throughout that they were actually occurring in the past. The current hit series \u201cThis Is Us\u201d reinvented the family-soap-opera genre by structuring each episode as a series of time-jumps, sometimes spanning more than 50 years. The final five minutes of the Season 3 opener, which aired earlier this fall, jump back and forth seven times among 1974, 2018 and some unspecified future that looks to be about 2028.\n\nThese narrative developments suggest an intriguing possibility: that popular entertainment is training our minds to get better at cognitive time travel. If you borrowed Wells\u2019s time machine and jumped back to 1955, then asked typical viewers of \u201cGunsmoke\u201d and \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d to watch \u201cArrival\u201d or \u201cLost,\u201d they would have found the temporal high jinks deeply disorienting. Back then, even a single flashback required extra hand-holding \u2014 remember the rippling screen? \u2014 to signify the temporal leap. Only experimental narratives dared challenge the audience with more complex time schemes. Today\u2019s popular narratives zip around their fictional timelines with the speed of the default network itself.\n\nThe elaborate timelines of popular narrative may be training our minds to contemplate more complex temporal schemes, but could new technology augment our skills more directly? We have long heard promises of \u201csmart drugs\u201d on the horizon that will enhance our memory, but if the Homo prospectus argument is correct, we should probably be looking for breakthroughs that will enhance our predictive powers as well.\n\nIn a way, those advances are already around us, but in the form of software, not pharmaceuticals. If you have ever found yourself mentally running through alternate possibilities for a coming outing \u2014 what happens if it rains? \u2014 based on a 10-day weather forecast, your prospective powers have been enhanced by the time-traveling skills of climate supercomputers that churn through billions of alternative atmospheric scenarios, drawn from the past and projecting out into the future. These visualizations are giving you, for the first time in human history, better-than-random predictions about what the weather will be like in a week\u2019s time. Or say that dream neighborhood you\u2019re thinking about moving to \u2014 the one you can finally afford if you manage to get that raise \u2014 happens to sit in a flood zone, and you think about what it might be like to live through a significant flood event 10 years from now, as the climate becomes increasingly unpredictable. That you\u2019re even contemplating that possibility is almost entirely thanks to the long-term simulations of climate supercomputers, metabolizing the planet\u2019s deep past into its distant future.\n\nAccurate weather forecasting is merely one early triumph of software-based time travel: algorithms that allow us to peer into the future in ways that were impossible just a few decades ago, what a new book by a trio of University of Toronto economists calls \u201cprediction machines.\u201d In machine-learning systems, algorithms can be trained to generate remarkably accurate predictions of future events by combing through vast repositories of data from past events. An algorithm might be trained to predict future mortgage defaults by analyzing thousands of home purchases and the financial profiles of the buyers, testing its hypotheses by tracking which of those buyers ultimately defaulted. A result of that training would not be an infallible prediction, of course, but something similar to the predictions we rely on with weather forecasts: a range of probabilities. That time-traveling exercise, in which you imagine buying a house in the neighborhood with the great schools, could be augmented by a software prediction as well: The algorithm might warn you that there was a 20 percent chance that your home purchase would end catastrophically, because of a market crash or a hurricane. Or another algorithm, trained on a different data set, might suggest other neighborhoods where home values are also likely to increase.\n\nThese algorithms can help correct a critical flaw in the default network: Human beings are famously bad at thinking probabilistically. The pioneering cognitive psychologist Amos Tversky once joked that where probability is concerned, humans have three default settings: \u201cgonna happen,\u201d \u201cnot gonna happen\u201d and \u201cmaybe.\u201d We are brilliant at floating imagined scenarios and evaluating how they might make us feel, were they to happen. But distinguishing between a 20 percent chance of something happening and a 40 percent chance doesn\u2019t come naturally to us. Algorithms can help us compensate for that cognitive blind spot.\n\nMachine-learning systems will also be immensely helpful when mulling decisions that potentially involve a large number of distinct options. Humans are remarkably adept at building imagined futures for a few competing timelines simultaneously: the one in which you take the new job, the one in which you turn it down. But our minds run up against a computational ceiling when they need to track dozens or hundreds of future trajectories. The prediction machines of A.I. do not have that limitation, which will make them tantalizingly adept at assisting with some meaningful subset of important life decisions in which there is rich training data and a high number of alternate futures to analyze.\n\nChoosing where to go to college \u2014 a decision almost no human being had to make 200 years ago that more than a third of the planet now does \u2014 happens to be a decision that resides squarely in the machine-learning sweet spot. There are more than 5,000 colleges and universities in the United States. A great majority of them are obviously inappropriate for any individual candidate. But no matter where you are on the ladder of academic achievement \u2014 and economic privilege \u2014 there are undoubtedly more than a few dozen candidate colleges that might well lead to interesting outcomes for you. You can visit a handful of them, and listen to the wisdom of your advisers, and consult the college experts online or in their handbooks. But the algorithm would be scanning a much larger set of options: looking at data from millions of applications, college transcripts, dropout rates, all the information that can be gleaned from the social-media presence of college students (which is, today, just about everything). It would also scan a parallel data set that the typical college adviser rarely emphasizes: successful career paths that bypassed college. From that training set it could generate dozens of separate predictions for promising colleges, optimized to whatever rough goals the applicant defined: self-reported long-term happiness, financial security, social-justice impact, fame, health. To be clear, that data will be abused, sold off to advertisers or stolen by cyberthieves; it will generate a thousand appropriately angry op-eds. But it will also most likely work on some basic level, to the best that we\u2019ll be able to measure. Some people will swear by it; others will renounce it. Either way, it\u2019s coming.\n\nIn late 2017, the Crime Lab at the University of Chicago announced a new collaboration with the Chicago Police Department to build a machine-learning-based \u201cofficer support system,\u201d designed specifically to predict which officers are likely to have an \u201cadverse incident\u201d on the job. The algorithm sifts through the prodigious repository of data generated by every cop on the beat in Chicago: arrest reports, gun confiscations, public complaints, supervisor reprimands and more. The algorithm uses archived data \u2014 coupled with actual cases of adverse incidents, like the shooting of an unarmed citizen or other excessive uses of force \u2014 as a training set, enabling it to detect patterns of information that can predict future problems.\n\nThis sort of predictive technology immediately conjures images of a \u201cMinority Report\u201d-style dystopia, in which the machines convict you of a precrime that by definition hasn\u2019t happened yet. But the project lead, Jens Ludwig, points out that with a predictive system like the one currently in the works in Chicago, the immediate consequence would simply be an officer\u2019s getting some additional support or counseling, to help avert a larger crisis. \u201cPeople get understandably nervous about A.I. making the final decision,\u201d Ludwig says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t envision that A.I. would be making the decision.\u201d Instead, he imagines it as a \u201cdecision-making aid\u201d \u2014 an algorithm that \u201ccan help sergeants prioritize their attention.\u201d\n\nNo matter how careful the Chicago P.D. is in deploying this particular technology, we shouldn\u2019t sugarcoat the broader implications here: It seems inevitable that people will be fired thanks to the predictive insights of machine-learning algorithms, and something about that prospect is intuitively disturbing to many of us. Yet we\u2019re already making consequential decisions about people \u2014 whom to hire, whom to fire, whom to listen to, whom to ignore \u2014 based on human biases that we know to be at best unreliable, at worst prejudiced. If it seems creepy to imagine that we would make them based on data-analyzing algorithms, the decision-making status quo, relying on our meanest instincts, may well be far creepier.\n\nWhether you find the idea of augmenting the default network thrilling or terrifying, one thing should be clear: These tools are headed our way. In the coming decade, many of us will draw on the forecasts of machine learning to help us muddle through all kinds of life decisions: career changes, financial planning, hiring choices. These enhancements could well turn out to be the next leap forward in the evolution of Homo prospectus, allowing us to see into the future with more acuity \u2014 and with a more nuanced sense of probability \u2014 than we can do on our own. But even in that optimistic situation, the power embedded in these new algorithms will be extraordinary, which is why Ludwig and many other members of the A.I. community have begun arguing for the creation of open-source algorithms, not unlike the open protocols of the original internet and World Wide Web. Drawing on predictive algorithms to shape important personal or civic decisions will be challenging enough without the process\u2019s potentially being compromised or subtly redirected by the dictates of advertisers. If you thought Russian troll farms were dangerous in our social-media feeds, imagine what will happen when they infiltrate our daydreams.\n\nToday, it seems, mind-wandering is under attack from all sides. It\u2019s a common complaint that our compulsive use of smartphones is destroying our ability to focus. But seen through the lens of Homo prospectus, ubiquitous computing poses a different kind of threat: Having a network-connected supercomputer in your pocket at all times gives you too much to focus on. It cuts into your mind-wandering time. The downtime between cognitively active tasks that once led to REST states can now be filled with Instagram, or Nasdaq updates, or podcasts. We have Twitter timelines instead of time travel. At the same time, a society-wide vogue for \u201cmindfulness\u201d encourages us to be in the moment, to think of nothing at all instead of letting our thoughts wander. Search YouTube, and there are hundreds of meditation videos teaching you how to stop your mind from doing what it does naturally. The Homo prospectus theory suggests that, if anything, we need to carve out time in our schedule \u2014 and perhaps even in our schools \u2014 to let minds drift.\n\nAccording to Marcus Raichle at Washington University, it may not be too late to repair whatever damage we may have done to our prospective powers. A few early studies suggest that the neurons implicated in the default network have genetic profiles that are often associated with long-term brain plasticity, that most treasured of neural attributes. \u201cThe brain\u2019s default-mode network appears to preserve the capacity for plasticity into adulthood,\u201d he told me. Plasticity, of course, is just another way of saying that the network can learn new tricks. If these new studies pan out, our mind-wandering skills will not have been locked into place in our childhood. We can get better at daydreaming, if we give ourselves the time to do it.\n\nWhat will happen to our own time-traveling powers as we come to rely more on the prediction machines of A.I.? The outcome may be terrifying, or liberating, or some strange hybrid of the two. Right now it seems inevitable that A.I. will transform our prospective powers in meaningful new ways, for better or for worse. But it would be nice to think that all the technology that helped us understand the default network in the first place also ended up pushing us back to our roots: giving our minds more time to wander, to slip the surly bonds of now, to be out of the moment."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "Gardiner Harris", "title": "U.S. Levels Sanctions on 17 Saudis for Alleged Involvement in Khashoggi Killing", "description": "The Trump administration announced sanctions against 17 Saudis accused of involvement in the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/world/middleeast/saudis-sanctions-khashoggi.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/16/us/politics/16dc-sanctions/16dc-sanctions-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:45:39Z", "content": "In Riyadh, the hope is that the latest explanation will protect Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from growing questions about whether he is suited to rule.

In the Minneapolis area, for example, incomes rose 22 percent while home prices rose 46 percent.\n\nThose rising home prices got help from years of very low mortgage rates, which put more expensive homes within reach for people at a given income level. Activity was also probably boosted by some bounce-back effect after the housing market crash of 2007-09, a result of pent-up demand for homes that were not bought while the market was collapsing.\n\nRates bottomed out in late 2012 at 3.31 percent for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. They have been moving upward in fits and starts since, including a full percentage point in the last year alone to nearly 5 percent \u2014 still low by historical standards, but high compared with the ultralow levels that had enabled these huge price gains.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that demographics are favorable for housing demand. The peak birth year for millennials was 1990; it\u2019s a group that is turning 28 this year and thus entering prime years for home buying. As it happens, 28 is exactly the median response in a Bankrate survey that asked adults for the ideal age to buy a home.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter if prices are out of reach relative to incomes. Moreover, lending standards have remained more rigorous than they were during the last housing boom, so it has been harder for people to stretch to buy a home. The inability of people to buy homes they can\u2019t really afford is great news in terms of avoiding another crisis, but not so great for the near-term outlook for housing.\n\n\u201cBuyers can only stomach so many price increases until it gets unsustainable,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at the online brokerage Redfin. \u201cPrices reached a breaking point where buyers were fed up and started to consider other options,\u201d she said, including renting and moving away from the expensive coastal markets where prices are most out of whack with incomes.\n\nAs Economics 101 teaches, price movements are the way that supply and demand match up with each other.

Mr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. \u201c\n\nIts leadership squirmed over Russian meddling investigations:\n\n\u201cMr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of [Sheryl] Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal. \u2018You threw us under the bus!\u2019 she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.\u201d\n\nThe company hadn\u2019t prepared for the worst on its platform:\n\n\u201c \u2018We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u2019 Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.\u201d\n\nBut pushed its messaging hard:\n\n\u201cFacebook also expanded its work with [the P.R. firm] Definers. On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called [Apple\u2019s C.E.O. Tim] Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users.\u201d\n\nAnd Mark Zuckerberg was apoplectic about the criticism:\n\nAfter Mr. Cook publicly derided Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg was so furious that he later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\n\u201cAs evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view.\u201d\n\nThe NYT story has already prompted speculation about how the company will react to it. Recode asks: \u201cWho does Facebook fire?\u201d Facebook has already cut ties with Definers.\n\nFacebook has claimed that there are \u201ca number of inaccuracies\u201d in the report.\n\nMore Facebook news: Morale is reportedly falling inside the company. Human rights groups want it to adopt a \u201cdue process\u201d system for removing content. And Instagram\u2019s former C.E.O., Kevin Systrom, says that policing social media will become increasingly important.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s cabinet approved her Brexit plan. Now, a revolt?\n\nThe British prime minister faced down some of her biggest critics yesterday and won the support of her divided cabinet for a plan to exit the European Union. But she must still confront huge hurdles."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "GLENN KENNY", "title": "\u2018Instant Family\u2019 Review: The Adoption Option, Hollywood Style", "description": "\u201cInstant Family\u201d is a Sean Anders comedy with good intentions that\u2019s not entirely hellish, but is reliably anodyne.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/movies/instant-family-review.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/16/arts/16instantfamilypix1/merlin_146731482_160c938e-494c-432c-be39-a6deb4f60fce-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:00:05Z", "content": "Here is where I might make the usual comment about those good intentions.

Our lives are full of cultural work that requires this kind of give and take, which depends in turn on accessibility, literacy and accountability. Most of the truly beautiful things humans create emerge from that kind of multi-agent process. As we start to work with A.I., we will need to find ways to collaborate with it.\n\nSo how do we go about expanding our thinking?\n\nOne way is to recognize the diversity of work already going on that gets drowned out by the loudest and most powerful voices talking about A.I. It is also important to consider who is in the room when A.I. systems are designed, and how easy it is for those human architects to embed their biases in the systems they build. Additional voices need to be at the table, people from groups underrepresented in Silicon Valley-style innovation, especially women, people of color, and the economically disadvantaged. Bringing more diversity into the design process will improve the outcomes of technologists who seek to design products and solve problems for \u201ceveryone.\u201d\n\nOne great example of bringing diversity into A.I. is the Global A.I. Narratives project from Cambridge University\u2019s Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence, which seeks to understand what stories we are telling about the future of A.I. outside the Anglophone West.\n\nAnother kind of diversity lies in our rich cultural archives. People have been dreaming and writing about A.I. for centuries. Inspired by the work of Mr. Noessel, the Center for the Future of Intelligence and others, I am helping to lead A.I. Policy Futures, a project at Arizona State University and the New America Foundation. Our first goal is to create a taxonomy of A.I. in science fiction literature and film. We hope this will give us a broader view of the possibilities of A.I. by resurrecting good ideas that we have collectively forgotten, while also highlighting the gaps in our collective thinking.\n\nThe best way forward is to commit to the goal of thinking more holistically about A.I. and then orchestrate activities and conversations to advance it. When you bring together science fiction writers, technologists and policymakers, you create a feedback loop in which interesting things tend to happen. People ask one another simple yet surprisingly profound questions. Leaders in these different fields occasionally realize they have been working with impoverished conceptions of what particular words or ideas really mean. New plans and stories get hatched. From the Science Fiction Advisory Council at the X-Prize Foundation to the value that entities like NASA have attached to science fiction, there is growing recognition in the power and potential of this feedback loop.\n\nA.I. is too interesting, too ubiquitous, and too poorly defined to be left to Hollywood mega-franchises or the same old cultural shorthand we\u2019ve been using for 60 years. The thinking machines we should be talking about are not super-intelligences or replicants but rather the just-smart-enough technologies already changing our lives. How will we deal with A.I. that is not alien or omniscient but just a few steps ahead of us, like a good tennis partner?\n\nWe have to tell new stories about \u201clittle\u201d A.I.: machines that aren\u2019t trying to take over the world but just get the job done. Most important, we need more stories about real people in these futures, and how we will adapt to a reality where we share intelligence, work and creativity with our machines.\n\nEd Finn, the author of \u201cWhat Algorithms Want: Imagination in the Age of Computing\u201d and co-editor of \u201cFrankenstein: Annotated for Scientists, Engineers, and Creators of All Kinds,\u201d is the founding director of the Center for Science and the Imagination at Arizona State University, where he is an associate professor.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "THOMAS B.

That\u2019s a terrible omen for Republicans, who spent the month before the election begging voters to vote straight-ticket R. Once voters get in the habit of splitting their ballot, they\u2019re more likely to do so in the future.\n\nHooks reported a conversation he had with O\u2019Rourke last July in \u201ca crummy hotel bar\u201d in Lubbock, Tex. when O\u2019Rourke talked not only about winning, but also\n\nabout the effect he hoped his race would have on the people around him. He would go to places Democrats don\u2019t go, engage people in a politics that was collaborative, spontaneous and felt good, and hope that it gave them tools and encouragement to keep going after he was done. The success of that project was dependent on O\u2019Rourke doing well enough, and proving the haters wrong. He did. Only time will tell what the race left behind. But according to his own terms \u2014 and let\u2019s use a damn cuss here, in tribute to the man \u2014 it looks like he knocked it out of the \u2026 park.\n\nIn the Atlantic, Hooks cautioned that it was too early in the process of partisan transition to suggest that Texas is on the verge of turning blue, but that the Nov. 6 results \u201cjust might be the beginning of the end\u201d of Republican dominance.\n\nHooks compared O\u2019Rourke\u2019s losing bid to that of John Tower \u2014 one of the first Republicans to break the pre-1965 Democratic stranglehold on Texas \u2014 who lost in his first attempt to win a Texas Senate seat in 1960 but went on to win in a 1961 special election.\n\nTower\u2019s victory demonstrated to Texas Republicans that their ambitions were not hopeless, \u201cthat the party could bide its time, be smart, and pick off races when it could,\u201d Hooks wrote. \u201cThat might just be \u2014 with a very strong emphasis on might \u2014 what happened to Texas Democrats in 2018.\u201d\n\nDespite his caution, Hooks appeared to be convinced that the 2018 election marked a turning point:\n\nSomething very strange happened here this year. Like Tower\u2019s bid, the full payoff may not come for many years. But the state party now has what the Republican Party then needed more than anything else: A reason to start building in earnest. That\u2019s not much, doubtless. But it just might be enough.\n\nPerhaps the most trenchant insights concerning Texas politics were offered by a prominent Republican, Joe Straus, who is retiring after serving 10 years as Speaker of the state House of Representatives. Despite a lifetime career in Republican politics, in a postelection interview with the Texas Tribune, Straus described his own distaste for some of the leaders of the party\u2019s right wing.\n\nHe acknowledged that he split his ticket \u201cmore than I ever have before\u201d and cited the\n\ninfectious enthusiasm (in the O\u2019Rourke campaign) which was brighter than what a lot of his opponents were offering.\n\nTrump, who campaigned extensively for Cruz, demonstrated \u201cborderline racism\u201d at times, Straus said. Some of Trump\u2019s \u201crhetoric is extremely divisive\u201d and\n\nIt\u2019s dark. It\u2019s not unifying. It\u2019s not factual in many cases, and I think that\u2019s the wrong direction for the leader of any party.\n\nFor her part, Julie McCarty, the Tea Party stalwart in North Texas, remains firm in her commitment. She wrote her supporters:\n\nI am called to fight for freedom and righteousness, and that is all I know to do. We continue to educate and push back as long as we have the chance \u2026 and we do still have the chance because even though we had some squeakers and some tough losses, TEXAS IS STILL A RED STATE.\n\nStraus was more considered in his assessment of Texas politics: \u201cThe Republican Party and the state of Texas are moving in opposite directions.\u201d\n\nI invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "A.O.

Now, more flu-shot makers are adding a second B strain to create a so-called quadrivalent vaccine that provides a bit more protection.\n\nThe more strains the better, right?

Those possibilities \u2014 and the danger that lethal machine errors could precipitate bloodier conflicts \u2014 will require close cooperative measures between robot-armed nations. Delegations to the United Nations have begun discussions on regulating lethal autonomous weapon systems under an existing Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which governs things ranging from booby traps to blinding lasers.\n\nIn August, a United Nations working group set down principles that could be used to guide future international regulations on lethal autonomy. Chief among them is the idea of ensuring human responsibility for any weapon throughout its life cycle, which could create new liabilities for arms manufacturers. The United Nations group is set to release a formal report, with recommendations for future action, this month. Besides governments, the group\u2019s meetings attract their share of activists, like Mary Wareham of Human Rights Watch, who is the global coordinator for the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, an initiative launched in 2013 with the explicit mission of keeping humans in charge of lethal decisions in war.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve focused on two things that we want to see remain under meaningful, or appropriate, or adequate, or necessary human control,\u201d Wareham says. \u201cThat\u2019s the identification and selection of targets and then the use of force against them, lethal or otherwise.\u201d Those are the key decision points, critics say, where only a human\u2019s judgment \u2014 capable of discriminating between enemies and civilians, and keeping a sense of proportionality in responding \u2014 can be accountable and satisfy the conventions of war.\n\nIs it morally acceptable to delegate decisions of life and death to robots?\n\nThe way in which we tend to justify war or condemn certain acts \u201chas to do with the fact that human beings are making decisions that are either moral or immoral,\u201d says Pauline Shanks Kaurin, a professor specializing in military ethics at the U.S. Naval War College. \u201cIf humans aren\u2019t making those decisions, if it\u2019s literally machines against machines, then it seems like then it\u2019s something else, right?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the ways in which robotic firepower can be harnessed by humans that have spurred some of autonomous weaponry\u2019s sharpest critics. In 2015, Steve Wozniak and Elon Musk, along with Stephen Hawking and more than 1,000 robotics and artificial-intelligence researchers, signed an open letter warning that \u201cautonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs\u201d of the future, \u201cideal for tasks such as assassinations, destabilizing nations, subduing populations and selectively killing a particular ethnic group.\u201d Google, which had several of its senior artificial-intelligence researchers among the letter\u2019s signatories, published a statement of its own principles on artificial intelligence in June 2018, including an outright refusal to develop \u201cweapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.\u201d\n\nFor Work, the question of morality might come down to America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cThere may be a place and time in the future where we\u2019re up against an opponent who is less worried about delegating lethal authority to a machine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s a long way off, and we have a lot of time to think about that and a lot of time to take action and make sure that we can still control all the weapons.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "WESLEY MORRIS", "title": "Critic\u2019s Notebook: Aretha Franklin Didn\u2019t Want You to See This Movie.

Franklin herself often seems modest, girlish (she was 29 at the time), never more so than when she\u2019s being praised by her father, the Rev. C.L. Franklin. She retains her composure through the entire affair. Not even a spiritual ruckus that breaks out toward the end of Night Two can disturb the hold the music has over her. Both nights, she\u2019s covered in perspiration. Yet so strong are her sublimation abilities that the beads of sweat appear to bejewel her.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, before it became a church, New Temple Missionary used to be a different house of worship: It used to be a movie theater. (There\u2019s a painting of Jesus hung where the screen probably was.) So it feels more than right that this album was recorded and filmed there.

I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise.

Blake Snell of the Tampa Bay Rays took the 2018 A.L. Cy Young Award, putting up the next-lowest E.R.A. in the majors after deGrom, at 1.89. He had the wins (a 21-5 record) but not the innings (180\u2154 innings).\n\nSnell\u2019s innings total was the lowest for Cy Young Award-winning starting pitcher in a full season \u2014 partly because he missed two weeks in July with due to shoulder fatigue. The low number was likely a big reason Snell narrowly edged out Houston\u2019s Justin Verlander: 169 to 154 in overall points and 17 to 13 in first-place votes. Verlander, who won the award in 2011, became the fourth pitcher to finish second in the balloting three times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s turning more into the quality of the work than what did you accomplish,\u201d Snell said.\n\nSnell, 25, did not record as many innings or strikeouts as the other A.L. finalists, Corey Kluber of the Cleveland Indians and Verlander, but he was the hardest starting pitcher to hit this season: Opponents posted a major league-worst .178 batting average against him.\n\nSince the league adopted the designated hitter rule in 1973, only four qualified A.L. pitchers have posted an E.R.A. below 2.00: Ron Guidry (1978), Roger Clemens (1990), Pedro Martinez (2000), and Snell. Snell went 9-3 with a 1.94 E.R.A. over nearly 79 innings against playoff teams.\n\nOn a team that regularly employed the strategy of \u201cbullpenning\u201d \u2014 eschewing traditional roles for starting and relief pitchers to take advantage of matchups \u2014 Snell was the lone Rays\u2019 pitcher to remain as a starter from beginning to end, which he said made the award that much sweeter. Others shifted roles, sustained bigger injuries or were traded away, but Snell logged by far the most innings and starts on his team."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "GLENN THRUSH, AUDRA D.

But it signaled the start of another to get across that border, something that President Trump has promised to impede, even for those seeking asylum. Mr. Trump has labeled the caravan an invasion, deployed American soldiers to the border and made changes to asylum rules in efforts to confront it.\n\nA few of the migrants who have made it to Tijuana were already trying to figure out how to get appointments with American border officials to present their cases for sanctuary, migrants\u2019 advocates said. Most, however, appear to be biding their time and considering their options, including seeking sanctuary in the United States, trying to cross illegally or remaining in Mexico.\n\nAbout 800 migrants associated with the caravan have made it to Tijuana so far, according to local officials and advocates, with thousands more still crossing Mexico and expected to arrive in the next several days."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "REBECCA R.
