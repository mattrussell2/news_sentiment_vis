I poked this thing as far as I could, up to the handle, down the drain, wiggled it around and pulled it out. Nothing. Tried again. Still nothing. Did this about four or five more times and still nothing. About this time I figured this thing was a waste of my time and a ripoff.\n\nThen for one last try I put this in from the other side of the drain and wiggled it around. Pulled it out and there was a hairball about the size of a mouse hooked on the bottom end of this thing. Tried again and got a little more hair. The next time nothing so I quit. I filled the sink with hot water and then pushed the lever to drain the sink. Watched the whirlpool as the water went down the drain. Saved the other two for next time.

The Starbucks surprise: \"I used to manage a Starbucks, and one day when one of my baristas asked a guy his name, he just flipped the fuck out, belittling her and calling her stupid, but didn\u2019t give a name. Anyway, I took over the pick-up counter and placed his drink there with no words written on it. (It was a busy store with a lot of people waiting.) I just kept putting drinks out for about 10-15 minutes, and finally the douchebag walked up, picked up his lukewarm drink, and goes, \u201cIs this mine?\u201d I just respond, \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have a name on it.\" \u2014Thejustinset\n\n3.

My friend is so petty, he placed fake for-sale ads with too-good-to-be-true deals, like a nice boat for $1,000, with the guys number. On top of that, our city is big on garage sales, so he posted ads like, \u201cMoving out sale, everything must go, cheap! Will be held inside the house \u2014 just walk in or ring the door bell,\u201d with the guy's address on the ad. He also signed him up for numerous 'free gym memberships' and responded to things like car dealership ads with this guy's phone number.\" \u2014Ash1989\n\n4. The party pisser: \"I lived in an apartment with a roommate, and we had neighbors who would throw crazy weeknight parties pretty frequently. One day my roommate, who had to be awake early, had enough and decided to piss on a metal pizza pan and stick it in the freezer. After a crazy party, he pulled the pan out and flipped it upside down, giving him a frozen disc of piss. He then slid that disc under their door, where it would melt on their fully carpeted entryway. We woke up to them shouting at the people who had crashed there about who pissed on the floor and what the fuck was wrong with them. I wish I could say they toned down their parties, but they didn't and eventually got evicted.\" \u2014Sharcbait\n\nTap to play GIF Tap to play GIF ABC\n\n5. The tech torturer: \"A coworker owed me $50 and refused to pay, so being in IT, I reduced their email storage capacity to hold only around 10 emails, and I removed them from distro groups so they missed important group emails. Also, every day for like three months I went into their account and checked the little box, 'Must change password at next login.'\" \u2014roguemerc96\n\n6. The beach bullies: \"We were kids staying at the seaside on holiday with our family. My little sister would always make a pretty sandcastle, but the next day we'd find that it had been kicked down and she'd cry. We wanted to find out who was doing it, so one day we stayed behind to spy. We watched as a bunch of jerk older boys came by and kicked her castle down, laughing smugly. So the next night, we covered a big beach rock in sand and decorated it. Like clockwork, the jerk kids came with their smug faces and this time kicked a solid rock with all of their might. The yowl and the look on their faces was the best revenge ever.\" \u2014AmyDiaz99\n\n7. The ketchup counterattack: \"My coworker sometimes throws out her lunch in the garbage can at my desk instead of her own, because she claims she can't stand the smell of ketchup that's been sitting out for a couple hours. I've asked her to stop several times, but she now just waits until I get up to go to the bathroom to hide my garbage can \u2014 with her soiled lunch container inside \u2014 under my desk so I won't see it. Every time she does it, I wait until she goes to the bathroom, take out the little plastic container that she had ketchup in, and put it way in the back of her bottom desk drawer. There are six in there now, and the oldest is over a month old. So far, she hasn't noticed the smell. Gonna keep doing it and see how long it takes her to notice.\" \u2014Brunurb1\n\nTap to play GIF Tap to play GIF NBC\n\n8. The popcorn payback: \"I had a boss seven or eight years ago who I hated. She was the fakest and most entitled person I had ever met. One day, she decided that she didn\u2019t like the smell of microwave popcorn, so she waved her magic office wand and had it banned. Fast-forward a month or so, I was browsing Amazon and found one of those USB sticks that emits a smell when plugged in \u2014 the smell of buttered popcorn. I bought it and plugged it into the back of her computer, and she had the sweet smell of PopSecret in her office for six fucking months. She complained almost every day. It\u2019s the sweetest revenge I\u2019ve ever tasted.\" \u2014weshric\n\n9. The shit storm: \"My girlfriend told me that the neighbor across the street was instructing his dog to go shit on our lawn. I doubted it, but was home sick for a few days and saw it for myself. I asked the owner to stop it, and he said the dog wouldn\u2019t 'listen.' When I asked him to at least clean up the shit, he said his dog was only peeing. We had our own dog, and I took a week's worth of his land mines, plus the neighbor's dog's shits for the week, and walked across the street and threw them all over his front yard and walkway one night. Somehow the neighbor's dog listened after that and never shit in my yard again.\" \u2014mysteryslice\n\n10. The roommate retribution: \"My college roommate had a bad habit of leaving her things in piles on our bathroom floor until there was almost no space to walk to the bath or toilet. One day she left $40 scattered with the mess, so I put the money in one of her lesser-used bathroom drawers. Originally I put it there to protect it from our third roommate and her friends. When I came home the next day and noticed that she was clearing her mess in an effort to find it, I decided not to tell her where the money was until our bathroom floor was spotless. Afterwards, I decided it would be too awkward to tell her the truth, so I left the money wadded up in her hamper. She was ecstatic when she found it on laundry day. After that, her bathroom piles never got quite as big.\" \u2014beautifulexistence\n\n11. The birdseed backlash: \"I caught my flatmate telling lies about me to some mutual friends, so I made plans to move out the next month. In the meantime, she went out of town for a week and left her car parked in its usual spot in the parking lot. I threw birdseed on it every morning and evening, so when she came home, the birds wouldn't leave her car alone.\" \u2014otefl\n\nTap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Disney\n\n12. The clown car: \"There's a new truck in my apartment's parking lot that's always taking up multiple spots. I drive a much smaller car, and, being a petty and passive-aggressive person, I've been waiting for my chance to get revenge. Well, a few days ago, I got home quite late, and there were zero spots open in my lot. The big truck was double parked again, but there was juuust enough room on their driver's side for me to sneak in there with my little clown car. I carefully pulled in, making sure not to touch anything. My passenger side mirror was half an inch from their driver's side door. I giggled to myself all the way back to my apartment and set an alarm and waited. The following morning, I woke up before the alarm to loud door slamming and stomping around. I looked out my window, and I saw the double parking culprit walking around both vehicles, taking pictures, texting someone, and taking more pictures. I was shaking with glee. They finally swallowed their pride, climbed in the passenger side and over the center console, and Austin Powers 20-point turned their butts out of the spot. I've never been so proud of myself and my shitty, petty, passive-aggressive ways.\" \u2014Here2Lol\n\n13. The fire hydrant fake out: \"When I was a kid my family lived in a house on a street with GIANT oak trees. Because of the slope of our yard, leaves from half the street would end up in the yard. My mother had really bad asthma and allergies and made us kids rake up the leaves. This was not an easy task. They would get several feet deep if we didn't do it often enough. One day we raked the whole yard into these giant piles for the city to come pick up. It took several hours. The next morning, however, they were scattered all over. We raked them again over several more hours, and it happened again. Apparently the neighborhood bully was knocking them over just to be a dick. The next time we made a super huge pile around the fire hydrant, hoping he'd kick them and hurt his foot. Nope, this time he decided to do a run and jump.\" \u2014kperkins1982\n\n14. The cooking lard cheesecake: \"At my previous job, we had separate refrigerators for different shifts, but our food was constantly being stolen or messed with. One day, my buddy and I decided to make a nice cherry cheesecake \u2014 out of cooking lard. We finished it off with a graham cracker crust and cut a couple of slices out of it since we knew the thief wouldn\u2019t be brazen enough to take the first bite. We never found out who the thief was, but we never had to worry about anyone messing with our food ever again.\" \u2014chiefpompadour\n\nTap to play GIF Tap to play GIF VH1\n\n15. The guessing game: \"My brother did something to his annoy his then-girlfriend, so she took the labels off all his canned food in the cupboard. Are you opening a can of beans? Or a tin of tomato sauce? Or cat food? Kinda hilarious.\" \u2014WhoriaEstafan\n\n16. The arcade avenger: \"I used to go to an arcade and play a certain basketball game. I was climbing the all-time wins leaderboard in said game (very close behind No. 1) when one day my account vanished! None of the other accounts did, and I learned that somehow the No. 1 player \u2014 who worked there \u2014 had a hand in it. I waited until he played another game and watched as he put in his account code. I then waited 30 minutes until he was done, logged into his account, and tanked a game pretty hard. When I was done, his record dropped to 210\u20131. Unfortunately, I didn't see his reaction, but I got way too much satisfaction from it.\" \u2014Nbajamkiller99\n\n17. The reverberating retaliation: \"I had a roommate in college that would blare their TV in their room and talk loudly on speakerphone well into the night. I was young and not confident enough to confront them about it. But after a semester, I had had enough. One time before going out, I put my speakers up against our shared wall and blasted Enya\u2019s 'Only Time' on endless repeat. I also locked my door so they couldn\u2019t come in to turn it off.

We had add-on services people could get. One was Armor All. $5 per region. A guy came in and ordered a full interior and exterior Armor All on his brand new truck. He had King's Ranch seats, so our salesmen didn't add that charge, as we generally didn't Armor All them. (FYI: King's Ranch is a type of suede that's generally a really pretty tan color and super soft. It costs about $3,500 for them. Armor All is essentially a grease that makes leather and vinyl shiny.)\n\nWhen he got back to his finished car, he pitched a fit because we didn't Armor-All his seats. We explained that he didn't pay for that charge, and we wouldn't, in good-conscience, do it. So he threw a huge fit, screaming and cursing and insisting to talk to the manager. We all tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't budge. My boss was a dick, so finally he said, 'Fuck it. Do it. In fact, do it for free.' So we did. I felt like I was committing a mortal sin rubbing greasy solution all over these beautiful suede seats, but the customer is always right, eh?\n\nThe guy walked back to his truck after it was finished with a smug look of satisfaction, until he looked at his seats and his entire face dropped and turned ghostly white. I said. 'Anything else I can do for you?' In shock, he said, 'H-How do I fix this?' I told him, 'Get Armor All on them a few more times to even out the color, but it'll never be the same again. Sorry. This is why we tried to talk you out of it.'

One thing you might notice from this photo is that her skin is straight-up GLOWING. In fact, she always seems to have ~flawless~ skin and makeup.\n\n...see?! Anyway, I recently had the opportunity to jump on the phone with Lea to ask her about her skincare and beauty routine, and she divulged all her secrets. So, of course, I decided to see what it would be like to live by her beauty routine for a week. Could I achieve flawless, celebrity-worthy skin??? One could only hope.\n\nLet's take a look at exhibit B...\n\nTo start off, one of the pieces of advice Lea gave was this: \"Beauty begins from within, and you should always take care of the inside first. Make sure you're drinking enough water, getting enough sleep, and eating well.\" Which is always a great reminder!!! Our skin hates too much caffeine and little sleep.\n\nWashing my face every morning and every night was already a routine for me, so I gave the iS Clinical cleanser a shot. It's a lightweight cleanser that felt refreshing and not too drying on my sensitive skin. I felt ~fancy~ using it.\n\nOn top of getting enough sleep and eating well, Lea believes in taking vitamins in the morning. It was like I got to start my day with TWO pieces of candy since Olly's Women's Multi takes like sour strawberry \u2014 and it's a gummy. I'd rather eat two of these in the morning than swallow a GIANT-ASS vitamin.\n\nLea told BuzzFeed, \"I'll go to Shani Darden for facials \u2014 she's in Los Angeles. I'm a firm believer in taking care of your skin.\"\n\nView this photo on Instagram\n\nThis next part was my favorite by FAR. Because Lea receives facials from esthetician Shani Darden once a month, I contacted her to see if I would be able to experience a facial the way she does. Lucky for me, Shani had time to get me in!\n\nBy the way, Shani's No. 1 piece of skincare advice is to use sunscreen!!!!!\n\nDid I feel pampered? YES. Shani's facials are roughly an hour long, customized for each individual's skin type.\n\nDid I feel pampered? YES. Shani's facials are roughly an hour long, customized for each individual's skin type.\n\nHere's everything that went down during my facial:\n\n1. Skin is cleansed.\n\n2. Shani looks at your skin to see what's going on.\n\n3. Vibration therapy: Tones, tightens, and lifts the skin.\n\n4. Skin peel. (\"The peel will depend on your skin type,\" Shani told BuzzFeed. \"With Lea, I usually do a pretty strong peel. She loves a nice, strong peel.\"\n\n5. Extractions.\n\n6. Mask. (This is also customized depending on what your skin needs.)\n\n7. Microcurrent. (\"It's like exercise for your muscles. It can give you a lift, define your cheekbones.\")\n\n8. Ultrasound to penetrate a product into the skin.\n\n9. LED light. (\"This boosts collagen into the skin, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and helps with acne.\")\n\nShani also noted, \"If Lea's doing a red carpet, I won't do extractions.\""}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Louise Khong", "title": "Just 15 Really Delicious Places To Eat At In Los Angeles", "description": "I'm not drooling; you're drooling.

It's what my parents had, it's what everyone in my family has, and they all love it as much as we do. Our 3-year-old son has autism and severe sensory issues making him the pickiest eater on the face of the planet. That being said, he will drink just about anything we put in his cup as long as it passes the look, smell, and texture tests. If it weren't for the Vitamix I don't know how we would've fed our child and made sure he got the protein, fresh fruits, and vegetables etc. that his little growing mind and body need. We can sneak ANYTHING into his smoothies and he has no idea because the Vitamix works so incredibly well at blending everything flawlessly. No chunks, no pulp, no fuss!

Eu tinha 21 anos e estava em uma loja de conveni\u00eancia. Eu s\u00f3 queria comprar algo gelado para meus irm\u00e3os beberem. Fiquei t\u00e3o surpresa com o modo casual com que ele questionou meu g\u00eanero que acidentalmente respondi: \u201cHomem!\u201d Depois, percebendo meu erro, acrescentei: \u201cN\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u2013 mulher!\u201d Meu rosto corou enquanto eu levava as bebidas at\u00e9 o caixa. O estranho sorriu para mim, como se estiv\u00e9ssemos compartilhando algum segredo. \u201cCaaaara\u201d, falou, colocando seus \u00f3culos escuros, \u201cVoc\u00ea disse homem primeiro\u201d. Voltei em sil\u00eancio para o meu carro. Minha irm\u00e3 me perguntou, v\u00e1rias vezes, o que havia de errado. Contei a hist\u00f3ria a ela, rindo para mostrar que estava bem. Mas, segundos depois, quando dei a r\u00e9 para sair do estacionamento, bati na porta do passageiro de um sed\u00e3 cor creme. Ningu\u00e9m se machucou, mas ambos os carros ficaram bem avariados. Durante mais de uma d\u00e9cada, passei por diversas experi\u00eancias como essa: ser confundida com um homem em p\u00fablico. E, apesar de nem todas terem resultado em um acidente de carro, todas me deixaram desorientada e me perguntando qual pedacinho de minha identidade era respons\u00e1vel pelo \u201cei, mo\u00e7o\u201d equivocado.\n\n\n\nAlgumas vezes, eu dizia para mim mesma que era por causa da minha altura e o modo autom\u00e1tico que a maioria das pessoas associa altura com masculinidade. Outras, me perguntava se essa rea\u00e7\u00e3o era provocada por minha voz grave, minha roupa andr\u00f3gina ou meu cabelo curto. No entanto, sempre tive consci\u00eancia de que minha ra\u00e7a e meu g\u00eanero desempenhavam um papel importante nesses \u201cmal-entendidos\u201d. Vivi tempo o bastante nesse mundo para perceber que raramente as mulheres negras t\u00eam pleno acesso \u00e0 sua feminilidade. N\u00e3o foi coincid\u00eancia o fato de um cara branco qualquer em uma loja de conveni\u00eancia achar perfeitamente normal perguntar para mim se eu era ou n\u00e3o uma mulher.\n\nMpi / Getty Images A ex-escrava e abolicionista Sojourner Truth (1797\u20131883), originalmente Isabella Van Wagener.\n\n\u00c9 poss\u00edvel que Sojourner Truth nunca tenho feito a famosa pergunta que atribuem a ela. Ex-escrava, Truth ficou conhecida por seu discurso inflamado na Conven\u00e7\u00e3o dos Direitos da Mulher em Ohio (EUA), em 1851. Segundo uma transcri\u00e7\u00e3o do discurso feita por Frances Dana Gage, ativista dos direitos da mulheres, e publicada no jornal \"New York Independent\", em 1863, Truth v\u00e1rias vezes repete a pergunta ret\u00f3rica: E n\u00e3o sou uma mulher? No entanto, tamb\u00e9m h\u00e1 outra transcri\u00e7\u00e3o do discurso, escrita por Marius Robinson, rep\u00f3rter e amigo de Truth, em que a pergunta n\u00e3o aparece. Apesar de muitos historiadores acharem que a vers\u00e3o de Robinson \u00e9 provavelmente a mais fiel, ela \u00e9 a menos conhecida pelo p\u00fablico. Em vez disso, \u00e9 a itera\u00e7\u00e3o \u201c\u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d que muitos estudantes leem quando estudam pensamento feminista negro.\n\nA ideia de que mulheres negras n\u00e3o s\u00e3o femininas est\u00e1 enraizado na hist\u00f3ria dos EUA. \u201cSe as mulheres negras s\u00e3o estereotipadas como inabal\u00e1veis nos EUA, nossa pesquisa demonstra que h\u00e1 outro mito intimamente ligado a essa ideia e que ainda persiste: o de que as mulheres negras s\u00e3o menos femininas do que outras mulheres e, na verdade, chegam a ser emasculadoras\u201d, escreveram a jornalista Charisee Jones e a pesquisadora Kumea Shorter-Gooden em Shifting: The Double Lives of Black Women in America (Em Muta\u00e7\u00e3o: A Vida Dupla das Mulheres Negras na Am\u00e9rica, em tradu\u00e7\u00e3o livre). \u201cEsse mito era traduzido em personagens como Tia Jemina [personagem-s\u00edmbolo de uma marca de produtos culin\u00e1rios nos EUA. A figura de Tia Jemina \u00e9 baseada no estere\u00f3tipo das mammys, escravas que trabalhavam como bab\u00e1s e empregadas dom\u00e9sticas para fam\u00edlias brancas, principalmente no Sul dos Estados Unidos. Para efeitos de compara\u00e7\u00e3o, podemos fazer o paralelo com a personagem de Tia Nast\u00e1cia na obra de Monteiro Lobato] e Sapphire [o estere\u00f3tipo da mulher negra raivosa e castradora], depois evoluiu para o arqu\u00e9tipo da menina negra grosseira e atrevida, uma imagem onipresente na cultura popular (...) tais representa\u00e7\u00f5es possuem um peso incomensur\u00e1vel na psiqu\u00ea das mulheres negras, que em seu desejo de serem vistas como \u2018damas\u2019, para combater a no\u00e7\u00e3o de que s\u00e3o menos femininas, acabam adotando um modo de falar e um comportamento que n\u00e3o reflete quem realmente s\u00e3o.\u201d\n\nRichard Shiro / Getty Images Serena Williams representando a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Americana, em Asheville, Carolina do Norte.\n\nMulheres negras s\u00e3o geralmente vistas como possuidoras de atributos associados \u00e0 masculinidade: somos \u201cfortes\u201d, \u201cindestrut\u00edveis\u201d, \u201cinvulner\u00e1veis \u00e0 dor\u201d. Uma pesquisa realizada em 2014 pelo site de relacionamentos OkCupid sobre os h\u00e1bitos de seus usu\u00e1rios revelou que 82% dos homens n\u00e3o negros tinham preconceito contra mulheres negras. Serena Williams (assim como sua irm\u00e3 mais velha, Venus) j\u00e1 foi comparada com um homem e teve de aturar as pol\u00eamicas sobre seu incr\u00edvel e bel\u00edssimo corpo durante quase toda a carreira. Leslie Jones foi alvo de insultos absurdos de cunho racista e sexista antes da estreia do filme Ca\u00e7a-Fantasmas. Uma funcion\u00e1ria p\u00fablica da Virg\u00ednia Ocidental achou que n\u00e3o havia problemas em chamar a ex-primeira dama dos EUA Michelle Obama de \u201cmacaca de salto alto\u201d. Uma mulher negra de 1,60m assustou tanto um homem branco (e bem mais alto) que acabou levando um tiro no rosto. Minha vida como uma mulher alta e de pele escura fez com que eu tivesse de enfrentar constantemente as no\u00e7\u00f5es de g\u00eanero imputadas a todas as mulheres negras, al\u00e9m de encarar o modo como internalizei muitas dessas ideias nefastas. Apesar de hoje poder dizer que exer\u00e7o minha feminilidade de um modo muito menos dependente de valida\u00e7\u00f5es externas, o caminho at\u00e9 essa convic\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o foi nem um pouco f\u00e1cil. Passei muito tempo lutando com a pergunta \u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d \u2013 n\u00e3o por incerteza minha, mas por causa da aparente certeza do resto do mundo.\n\nNunca esquecerei a primeira vez em que fui confundida com um homem. Eu estava na Feira Estadual do Novo M\u00e9xico e era recruta em treinamento de uma academia militar particular em Roswell, Novo M\u00e9xico (EUA). Era nossa primeira folga \u2013 os cadetes podiam passar o dia inteiro fora do campus. Mesmo com a obrigatoriedade da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do uniforme, ainda seria um dia divertido.\n\nPassei muito tempo lutando com a pergunta \u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d \u2013 n\u00e3o por incerteza minha, mas por causa da aparente certeza do resto do mundo.\n\nEu estava andando com Lauren, uma amiga minha bonita, de pele clara e mais baixa, e metade do time de basquetebol masculino estava na nossa cola, todos loucos para pegar o telefone de Lauren. Chegamos at\u00e9 a \u00e1rea da barraquinha do \u201cTeste Sua For\u00e7a\u201d. Eu estava andando \u00e0 frente, os caras ficaram para tr\u00e1s, flertando com minha amiga. \u201cPode vir, cavalheiro!\u201d, gritou o atendente da barraca em minha dire\u00e7\u00e3o, com uma voz que s\u00f3 posso descrever como a de um locutor de circo. Fiquei morta de vergonha, torcendo para os caras n\u00e3o terem ouvido. Mas as risadinhas abafadas atr\u00e1s de mim acabaram com as minhas esperan\u00e7as. O atendente, nervoso, pediu mil desculpas e me ofereceu uma \u201cmartelada\u201d gr\u00e1tis. Acertei o grande bot\u00e3o escuro sem entusiasmo e, apesar de n\u00e3o ter chegado nem perto do \u201cMegaforte\u201d, o atendente me deu o primeiro pr\u00eamio \u2013 um cachorro de pel\u00facia de 1,20 metro. \u201c\u00c9 o uniforme\u201d, disse para mim enquanto eu me afastava, com o cachorro embaixo do bra\u00e7o. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel que dessa vez eu tenha sido confundida com um homem por causa do meu uniforme militar, quadrad\u00e3o e de corte reto. Mas, mesmo antes dessa experi\u00eancia, sempre achei que minha feminilidade nunca foi algo claramente estabelecido. Se as mulheres eram (supostamente) alvo de todas as maldades do mundo, por que nunca me acompanharam at\u00e9 em casa ap\u00f3s o baile da escola, como faziam com minhas amigas brancas no ensino m\u00e9dio? Por que me ensinaram a ser \u201cdurona\u201d e me rotularam como \u201cforte\u201d antes mesmo de eu entrar no ensino fundamental? Na inf\u00e2ncia, eu n\u00e3o entendia isso. N\u00e3o completamente, pelo menos. E as mulheres n\u00e3o precisam ser amazonas de pele escura (como eu) para terem de lidar com o policiamento de g\u00eanero. Em \"Fome\", a mais recente autobiografia de Roxane Gay, a autora detalha as in\u00fameras vezes em que estranhos n\u00e3o a viam como mulher por causa do seu peso. E as mulheres negras trans ou \u201cque parecem l\u00e9sbicas\u201d s\u00e3o as maiores v\u00edtimas de viol\u00eancia, incluindo o risco de morte, por causa do seu suposto g\u00eanero.\n\nKean Collection / Getty Images A feminista, abolicionista e reformista social norte-americana Frances Dana Barker Gage (1808\u20131884), por volta de 1840.\n\nTer sua feminilidade questionada e, posteriormente, desprezada \u00e9 algo que Sojourner Truth conhecia muito bem. Segundo Nell Irvin Painter, historiadora da Universidade Princeton e autora do livro Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol (Sojourner Truth: Uma Vida, Um S\u00edmbolo, em tradu\u00e7\u00e3o livre), Sojourner nasceu no fim da d\u00e9cada de 1790 no norte de Nova York, recebendo o nome de Isabella dos pais, James e Elizabeth Baumfree, dois escravos de Johannes Hardenbergh. Sua vida nunca desviou muito das crueldades flagrantes da escravid\u00e3o na Am\u00e9rica: abuso sexual constante, p\u00e9ssimas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida, separa\u00e7\u00e3o familiar abrupta e arrasadora. Isabella ganhou sua liberdade em 1826 e alterou seu nome para Sojourner Truth em 1843.\n\n\u201cPensamos em Truth como uma presen\u00e7a natural e descomplicada em nossa vida como na\u00e7\u00e3o. Em vez de uma pessoa na hist\u00f3ria, ela funciona como um s\u00edmbolo. Para apreciarmos o significado do s\u00edmbolo \u2013 Mulher Negra Forte \u2013, n\u00e3o precisamos saber quase nada da pessoa\u201d, escreveu Painter. \u201cComo abolicionista e feminista, ela usou seu corpo e sua mente com um \u00fanico objetivo, representar fisicamente mulheres que tinham sido escravizadas. Num per\u00edodo em que a maioria dos americanos achava que os escravos eram todos homens e as mulheres eram todas brancas, Truth personificava um fato que ainda merece ser reiterado: entre os escravos, havia mulheres; entre as mulheres, havia negras.\u201d A maior parte dos relatos sobre Truth que datam daquela \u00e9poca s\u00e3o descri\u00e7\u00f5es impressionadas dos seus atributos f\u00edsicos. Para Harriet Beecher Stowe, autora de \"A Cabana do Pai Tom\u00e1s\", ela era a \u201cSibila L\u00edbia\u201d, uma refer\u00eancia \u00e0 profetisa norte-africana pintada na Capela Sistina por Michelangelo. No seu pref\u00e1cio ao discurso \u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d, Frances Dana Gage escreveu que Truth era uma \u201ccriatura estranha e maravilhosa\u201d, com uma \u201cconstitui\u00e7\u00e3o quase amaz\u00f4nica, chegando perto de 1,80 metro, cabe\u00e7a erguida e olhos que cortavam as nuvens, como em um sonho\u201d. A descri\u00e7\u00e3o de Gage ainda menciona o fato de Truth aparecer de bra\u00e7os nus, at\u00e9 os ombros, diante da multid\u00e3o. Essa \u00e9 a imagem de Truth que a maioria das crian\u00e7as americanas ver\u00e1 durante as aulas do breve M\u00eas da Hist\u00f3ria Negra: uma mulher negra alta e de pele escura, mostrando os m\u00fasculos como um halterofilista na praia. Seu corpo sendo um testamento ao modo como ela subvertia as no\u00e7\u00f5es tradicionais sobre feminilidade.\n\nQuando jogava basquete na faculdade, nos jogos fora de casa, quase sempre aparecia um babaca perguntando ao juiz se eu era realmente mulher, supondo em alto e bom som que eu tomava esteroides. Eu sabia que essas observa\u00e7\u00f5es eram feitas para me desconcentrar e geralmente fingia n\u00e3o ouvi-las, mas a verdade era mais complicada. Isso me magoava, mas tamb\u00e9m me deixava confusa: eu jogava com mulheres brancas t\u00e3o altas e fortes quanto eu. Por que esses caras n\u00e3o direcionavam seus insultos e esse policiamento da feminilidade alheia para elas? O que havia em meu corpo que atra\u00eda tanto esc\u00e1rnio e d\u00favida? \u201cA sociedade continua receosa de qualquer tipo de for\u00e7a feminina, ainda preferindo e abra\u00e7ando donzelas delicadas \u2013 um sentimento antiquado que limita todas as mulheres\u201d, escreveu Tamara Winfrey-Harris, escritora e feminista negra, em The Sisters Are Alright: Changing the Broken Narrative of Black Women in America (As Irm\u00e3s Est\u00e3o Bem: Mudando a Narrativa Deturpada de Mulheres Negras na Am\u00e9rica, em tradu\u00e7\u00e3o livre). \u201cMas como o rosto da donzela ainda \u00e9 visto como branco e feminino, isso torna-se um problema particularmente para mulheres negras. Enquanto a vulnerabilidade e a ternura forem a base do que \u00e9 aceito como feminilidade (e continuarem sendo um requisito para que a vida da mulher tenha valor), mulheres que s\u00e3o enxergadas como sobrenaturalmente indestrut\u00edveis por causa da sua ra\u00e7a n\u00e3o ter\u00e3o sua feminilidade reconhecida.\u201d Mesmo tendo como inspira\u00e7\u00e3o artistas extremamente inovadoras como Grace Jones \u2013 exuberante em seus trajes que desafiavam as conven\u00e7\u00f5es de g\u00eanero \u2013, eu ainda ficava receosa ao atravessar o campo minado da feminilidade. Quando era mais jovem, queria um corte pixie como o de Nia Long, mas ficava nervosa com um poss\u00edvel aumento no n\u00famero de \u201cei, mo\u00e7o\u201d que receberia. Ficava nervosa de ser encarada durante muito tempo durante meus alongamentos no basquete. Porra, at\u00e9 tinha vergonha do fato das iniciais do meu nome serem HE (ELE, em ingl\u00eas). Gostaria de n\u00e3o ter passado tanto desconforto com a representa\u00e7\u00e3o do meu g\u00eanero na \u00e9poca \u2013 al\u00e9m disso ter sido uma fonte significativa de ang\u00fastia, perdi v\u00e1rias oportunidades de comprar smokings irados em brech\u00f3s.\n\nHarry Herd / Redferns / Getty Images Grace Jones no Festival Popular de Common em Southampton Common.\n\nEu tenho de fazer muito para \u201cprovar\u201d que sou feminina e compensar minha \u201cnegritude\u201d (manter o cabelo longo, a voz suave, usar roupas femininas), enquanto as mulheres brancas ou de pele mais clara possuem muito mais liberdade para experimenta\u00e7\u00f5es. Diane Keaton e Cara Delevingne \u201cbrincam\u201d com o estilo tomboy. Quando uma estrela do cinema branca adota um corte pixie ou mais curto, ela \u00e9 gamine ou elegante. Claro, mulheres negras podem e adotam esse visuais e cortes de cabelo andr\u00f3ginos, mas eles s\u00e3o percebidos de uma maneira diferente em nossos corpos: elegante se transforma em militante, boyish vira m\u00e1sculo. A \u201cnegritude\u201d, principalmente quando ligada ao corpo negro de uma mulher, \u00e9 majoritariamente reconhecida como masculina. \u201cEnquanto as mulheres brancas de classe m\u00e9dia do per\u00edodo pr\u00e9-Guerra Civil eram consideradas \u2018anjos da casa\u2019 \u2013 belas, devotas, castas e delicadas \u2013, as mulheres negras eram encaradas como feras das plantations que n\u00e3o precisavam ter seus corpos, sensibilidades e virtudes protegidas. Apesar da economia americana do s\u00e9culo 19, baseada na escravid\u00e3o, ter dependido dessa distin\u00e7\u00e3o, essa vis\u00e3o bestial permaneceu muito tempo depois do fim da servid\u00e3o\u201d, escreveu Winfrey-Harris. Os pilares da feminilidade branca s\u00f3 se sustentam quando somos constantemente lembrados de sua sombra: a mulher negra forte e masculina.\n\nO relato estridente e demagogo de Gage sobre o discurso \u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d de Truth \u00e9 muito diferente do que foi recontado por Robinson, que escreveu sobre o mesmo discurso em 1851, poucas semanas depois da realiza\u00e7\u00e3o da conven\u00e7\u00e3o. Atuando como secret\u00e1rio na conven\u00e7\u00e3o, Robinson escreveu que Truth pediu licen\u00e7a para falar \u2013 muito diferente da postura agressiva retratada por Gage. A verdadeira Sojourner Truth \u201ctinha orgulho de falar um ingl\u00eas correto e opunha-se \u00e0s vers\u00f5es de seus discursos no carregado dialeto sulista\u201d, escreveu Painter. Na verdade, a l\u00edngua \u201cmaterna\u201d de Truth era o holand\u00eas, aprendido na \u00e9poca em que servia \u00e0 fam\u00edlia Hardenbergh, e muito provavelmente ela n\u00e3o teria aprendido o ingl\u00eas se n\u00e3o tivesse sido vendida para a fam\u00edlia Neely, que falava ingl\u00eas, aos 9 anos de idade.\n\nOs pilares da feminilidade branca s\u00f3 se sustentam quando somos constantemente lembrados de sua sombra: a mulher negra forte e masculina.\n\nA aus\u00eancia mais marcante na vers\u00e3o de Robinson do discurso de Truth \u00e9 a pergunta \u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d. Painter observou que, apesar de ser poss\u00edvel que Robinson n\u00e3o tenha prestado aten\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 pergunta uma vez, \u00e9 muito improv\u00e1vel que isso tenha acontecido quatro vezes (o n\u00famero de vezes que ela \u00e9 repetida na vers\u00e3o de Gage): \u201cA interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de Gage do discurso de Truth \u00e9 muito mais dram\u00e1tica do que o relato direto de Marius Robinson em 1851. Por meio da idealiza\u00e7\u00e3o e da elabora\u00e7\u00e3o, ela transforma os coment\u00e1rios de Truth em uma performance espetacular quatro vezes maior do que a vers\u00e3o dele.\u201d Gage queria escrever algo dram\u00e1tico \u2013 n\u00e3o necessariamente relatar a verdade. N\u00e3o foi Truth quem sentiu a necessidade de perguntar \u00e0 multid\u00e3o, majoritariamente branca, se ela era considerada uma mulher \u2013 foi Gage. Escrevendo para competir com Harriet Beecher Stowe e para promover sua pr\u00f3pria causa, como defensora do direito das mulheres, ela criou a caricatura de Sojourner Truth que a maioria das pessoas conhece hoje. Incapaz de vincular um conceito de for\u00e7a \u00e0s mulheres brancas, que eram o foco principal de sua luta, Gage apostou que o corpo negro e \u201cforte\u201d de Truth convenceria seus leitores de que as mulheres n\u00e3o eram t\u00e3o delicadas assim, a ponto de n\u00e3o poderem compartilhar os direitos e privil\u00e9gios dos homens. Ela precisava do s\u00edmbolo de Sojourner Truth para ganhar essa batalha: um relato honesto levando em conta a complicada humanidade de Truth n\u00e3o serviria.\n\nCerta vez, quase briguei com um cara no bairro de Lower East Side, em Nova York, ap\u00f3s ele me chamar de homem. Era 2014, sete anos ap\u00f3s o atentado de 11/9. Eu e outra amiga est\u00e1vamos saindo de um show burlesco em uma noite quente de ver\u00e3o. Um homem come\u00e7ou a nos seguir, berrando sobre sua destreza sexual \u00e0 minha amiga, que o ignorava solenemente. Eu tinha certeza que ele perderia o interesse depois de um tempo, mas aquilo continuou por tr\u00eas quarteir\u00f5es. Ent\u00e3o parei e o encarei. \u201cOlha, cara, ela n\u00e3o quer falar com voc\u00ea\u201d, eu disse. Ele n\u00e3o tirou os olhos de mim. \u201cQue porra, voc\u00ea \u00e9 um homem?\u201d, ele vociferou. \u201cIsso, eu sou a porra de um homem\u201d, respondi. E dei um tapa na cara dele. A \u00faltima vez que eu tinha brigado com algu\u00e9m tinha sido na quinta s\u00e9rie, e aqui estava eu, estapeando um estranho no meio de Nova York. Passamos os pr\u00f3ximos minutos discutindo, eu e o cara. Ele estava constrangido e queria brigar. Minha amiga tentava, sem muito sucesso, me tirar dali. Eventualmente, cada um seguiu o seu caminho, mas passei o resto da noite pensando sobre a pergunta do cara e a minha resposta. Fiquei me perguntando o porqu\u00ea de eu assumir t\u00e3o prontamente a identidade que o cara imp\u00f4s a mim, o porqu\u00ea de eu ter ficado t\u00e3o irritada a ponto de agredi-lo fisicamente. A noite poderia ter acabado de uma maneira muito pior do que acabou. N\u00e3o tinha mais como fingir que esse tipo de coisa n\u00e3o me afetava. No dia seguinte, trabalhei como volunt\u00e1ria em um evento beneficente sem fins lucrativos que ensinava autodefesa. Coincidentemente, neste ano o evento seria uma \u201cmaratona de socos\u201d no Prospect Park: uma grande roda de pessoas, a maioria mulheres, socando o ar ritmadamente. Enquanto eu socava o ar, pensava sobre a noite anterior. Nos \u00faltimos sete anos, me identifiquei verbalmente como homem duas vezes. Na primeira vez, foi um equ\u00edvoco. Mas, na \u00faltima, foi porque eu sabia que o homem parecia n\u00e3o me ver de outra maneira.

They have both been charged with aggravated sexual assault, causing actual bodily harm and depriving liberty, over the alleged events early in the morning of March 27 at the Shangri-La Hotel in Sydney.\n\nOn Wednesday Local Court magistrate Beverley Schurr denied an application for the woman at the centre of the case, who cannot be identified, to be compelled to give evidence at the committal hearing.\n\nThe committal hearing in the Local Court will determine whether Gao and Wang stand trial over the charges in the District Court.\n\nLawyers for Gao had argued they needed to cross-examine the woman over matters including what they say are inconsistencies between her police statements about the alleged assaults, and inconsistencies between her account and security camera footage from the night.\n\nThey also said they wanted to question her over when she said Gao had left the hotel room, and whether or not she had in fact consented to sex with Gao and Wang.\n\nThe prosecution argued that inconsistencies either did not arise, or were irrelevant to the alleged events in the hotel room, and the other issues did not amount to special reasons.\n\nSchurr ruled that the woman did not have to give evidence at committal as none of Gao\u2019s arguments met the legal test, which requires special reasons for the alleged victim to testify in the interests of justice.\n\n\n\nShe said footage from the karaoke club allegedly showed consensual kissing and cuddling between the woman and Wang, and noted that consent to one kind of sexual behaviour is not evidence of consent to another kind of sexual behaviour.\n\nShe also said that unlike some similar cases in which the complainant had been compelled to give evidence at committal, there was \"no evidence of retraction by the complainant\" in this case.\n\nAfter Schurr handed down her judgement, Gao\u2019s barrister John Korn said he would consider whether or not to apply to the Supreme Court to review the decision.\n\nInternational media and curious onlookers have descended on the various hearings in the case over the past six months, leading to courtrooms so full that people have sat on the floor or stood around the edges of the room.\n\n\n\nAs people entered Sydney\u2019s Central Local Court on Wednesday afternoon, they were warned by sheriffs to not film on the courthouse stairs, and repeatedly asked to turn off their mobile phones while in the courtroom.\n\nKorn also told Schurr that the sheriff\u2019s department had made clear the unusual amount of interest in the matter and was wondering \u201cif we can assist them\u201d by excusing Gao from court mentions.\n\nThe court registry told BuzzFeed News Gao will not be required to appear at the next mention so long as his lawyers are there.\n\nGao was granted bail in July this year under conditions including electronic monitoring, and resides in a Chatswood apartment with his wife Xuan Dong, also an actor, and their young daughter. Wang was refused bail.\n\nThe matter is next in court on November 23."}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Abby Kass", "title": "28 Way To Win At Parenting While Being Somewhat Lazy", "description": "Parenting is hard, so you might as well try to make it as easy as you possibly can!

I used a small food processor to puree them and then froze them all into cubes for easy storage. This steamer makes homemade baby-food making so simple!

It was voted down 32 to 12. During the debate Greens senator Larissa Waters said O'Sullivan should be ashamed of himself. \"Senator O'Sullivan needs to get his hands and his rosaries off my ovaries and those of the 10,000 Queensland women who have an abortion each year, 10,000 women who have the right to make a decision about their own bodies without the opinion of senator O'Sullivan getting in their way,\" Waters said during the debate.\n\nShe later withdrew the comment after Liberal senator Eric Abetz objected. O'Sullivan claimed it was these comments, which he characterised as \"attacks\", that prompted him to declare himself a woman on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI am going to declare my gender today, as I can, to be a woman and then you'll no longer be able to attack me.\u201d\n\nThe Queensland senator said that centre-right conservative politicians, such as himself, can't say the word abortion without being \"attacked\" by the Greens. \"We can't open our traps, you cannot say the word abortion without being attacked by this mob of almost \u2014 I'd say grubs if I didn't think you were gonna make me withdraw it, Mr Acting Deputy President, but it's out there now,\" O'Sullivan told the Senate. \"These people come and attack me for my religious basis the other day, using words like rosary beads, because I had the audacity to raise issues around late-term abortions where babies that are only minutes away from getting a smack on the arse and a name are being aborted under the policies of the Australian Greens.\" A later-term abortion is one performed at or after 24 weeks' gestation. According to the most recent figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 0.7% of abortions were carried out at or after 20 weeks. Most (94.6%) abortions in Australia take place before 13 weeks of gestation. O'Sullivan said the purpose of his comments was to \"call out\" the \"vomit\" and \"vitriol\" of the Greens.\n\n\"I will not stand silent, I will not stand mute while these people continue to marginalise policies and ideas ... that I think are largely supported still by the majority of the nation.\" O'Sullivan claimed making the gender \"declaration\" wasn't the reason he came into the chamber, but BuzzFeed News understands he was telling people that he was planning the stunt on Tuesday.\n\nHere's the video of Nationals senator Barry O'Sullivan saying he is declaring his gender \"to be a woman\" so the left-wing people can no longer \"attack\" him over his anti-abortion views. https://t.co/YzbOCWp0YC"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Andrea Hickey", "title": "Design The Ultimate Winter Look And We'll Tell You Your Birth Month", "description": "Show me that LEWK!

Ele nunca saiu do papel.\n\n\n\nO respons\u00e1vel pelo Gisa \u2013 e alvo da Procuradoria que apura desde fraude em licita\u00e7\u00e3o a favores ilegais do fornecedor \u2013 \u00e9 o deputado Luiz Henrique Mandetta (DEM-MS), ex-secret\u00e1rio municipal e favorito para assumir o Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade no governo Bolsonaro.\n\n\n\nMandetta teve os sigilos banc\u00e1rio e fiscal quebrados e est\u00e1 com os bens bloqueados h\u00e1 cinco anos. A Procuradoria afirma que o fornecedor, que n\u00e3o entregou o servi\u00e7o, pagou uma viagem do ent\u00e3o secret\u00e1rio a Portugal e teria bancado ainda despesas de Mandetta com a loca\u00e7\u00e3o de avi\u00e3o privado durante a campanha eleitoral de 2010, quando ele foi eleito deputado federal pela primeira vez.\n\n\n\nNesta ter\u00e7a, o presidente eleito, Jair Bolsonaro, refor\u00e7ou a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de favorito de Mandetta, elogiando-o: \"Ele \u00e9 muito benquisto pelos m\u00e9dicos de todo o Brasil, a Frente Parlamentar da Sa\u00fade \u00e9 simp\u00e1tica a ele, que deixou um rastro de bons servi\u00e7os l\u00e1 em Mato Grosso do Sul.\"\n\n\n\nA informatiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos prontu\u00e1rios em n\u00edvel nacional \u00e9 uma das promessas de Bolsonaro.\n\nO rastro de mau uso do dinheiro p\u00fablico no Gisa, com suspeita de fraude, come\u00e7ou a aparecer em uma sindic\u00e2ncia da Prefeitura de Campo Grande em 2013, depois que o grupo de Nelson Trad Filho (PTB-MS), primo de Mandetta, deixou a prefeitura.\n\nA sindic\u00e2ncia sobre o Gisa, que reuniu oito volumes de documentos, foi o ponto de partida para uma investiga\u00e7\u00e3o do Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico Federal. Em 2015, a Procuradoria apresentou as den\u00fancias, mas at\u00e9 hoje elas n\u00e3o foram analisadas pela Justi\u00e7a.\n\n\n\nPrimeiro, subiram ao STF porque o deputado do DEM tem prerrogativa de foro, e, este ano, retornaram \u00e0 primeira inst\u00e2ncia porque os fatos se deram antes de ele ter sido eleito para o Congresso. Os bens dele e de outros suspeitos foram bloqueados em 2013 por meio de medida cautelar (provis\u00f3ria).\n\n\n\nDe acordo com o Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico Federal, houve favorecimento no edital para a implanta\u00e7\u00e3o do programa ao cons\u00f3rcio liderado pela empresa Telemidia & Technology International Com\u00e9rcio e Servi\u00e7os de Tecnologia Ltda.\n\nSegundo a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, a empresa teve acesso \u00e0s regras da licita\u00e7\u00e3o, antes mesmo do edital ser publicado. Um dos ind\u00edcios de fraude \u00e9 que o or\u00e7amento apresentado pela empresa na licita\u00e7\u00e3o era exatamente igual ao montante de verba repassada pelo Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade, que j\u00e1 estava dispon\u00edvel pela Prefeitura de Campo Grande, naquele ano: R$ 8,1 milh\u00f5es.\n\n\n\nOutros concorrentes tamb\u00e9m foram desabilitados. A den\u00fancia afirma que a cl\u00e1usulas restritivas limitaram a concorr\u00eancia e a Telemidia venceu e assinou o contrato com a prefeitura, mesmo sem preencher requisitos do edital e at\u00e9 de ter apresentado documenta\u00e7\u00e3o falsa. Logo depois de assinar o contrato, a Telemidia subcontratou a empresa portuguesa Alert, embora o edital vetasse a terceiriza\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nSegundo a Procuradoria, foi a Telemidia que pagou uma viagem de Mandetta a Portugal, em 2010, onde ele se encontrou com executivos da Alert. Menos da metade do servi\u00e7o pago pela Prefeitura de Campo Grande foi entregue pela Telemidia/Alert. Dos 12 m\u00f3dulos previstos no Gisa, somente dois tinham sido entregues plenamente em 2015 e outros dois de forma parcial. O programa acabou engavetado.\n\n\n\n\n\nA vers\u00e3o de Mandetta\n\nO BuzzFeed News n\u00e3o conseguiu falar com Mandetta. Em ocasi\u00f5es passadas, o deputado disse que o Gisa n\u00e3o ficou operacional por causa de briga pol\u00edtica com o prefeito Alcides Bernal, que sucedeu Trad na Prefeitura. Ele nega que tenha favorecido ou sido favorecido pela empresa contratada.Mandetta disse ao jornal Folha de S.Paulo que informou o presidente Jair Bolsonaro que existem as a\u00e7\u00f5es de improbidade, mas que n\u00e3o \u00e9 r\u00e9u porque a Justi\u00e7a. Segundo ele, o presidente teria dito: \u201cP\u00f4, voc\u00ea ficou seis anos numa secretaria de sa\u00fade e tem s\u00f3 um processo?\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Jenna Guillaume", "title": "Praise Odin, Chris Hemsworth Shared Another Video Of Him Working Out", "description": "Mark me down as tired and thirsty.

This gives them a delicious caramelized flavor and makes them nice and tender.\n\nSo what makes his pie so special? Well, for starters, he CARAMELIZES his apples in a pan before he fills his pie with 'em.\n\nHis trick? He uses a tart dough instead of a pie dough \u2014 which is made with softened butter, eggs, sugar, and flour. The dough is much softened than a typical pie dough and bakes into the crispiest pie crust you've ever had.

Mix the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together. Peel, quarter, and core the apples, then cut into thick chunks. Place in a bowl and sprinkle with the spiced sugar to coat. Fry the apples in two batches: Melt half the butter in a wide, nonstick frying pan, add half the apple chunks, and fry over high heat until golden and caramelized around the edges, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining apples and butter. Let cool completely.\n\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Roll out about half of the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about \u215b-inch thickness. Overturn an 8-inch pie pan on top of the pastry and cut out a rough circle slightly bigger than the pan. Line the pan with the pastry, lightly pressing down to remove any air pockets, then trim off the excess pastry. Roll out the remaining pastry into another circle, again slightly larger than the pan, for the top crust.\n\nSpoon the cooled apples evenly into the pie shell. Brush the rim of the bottom crust with a little water, then drape the top crust over the pie. Press down lightly to seal and trim off the excess pastry. Crimp the edges and brush the top with the egg wash to glaze. Use the tip of a knife to cut a small cross in the center so that steam can escape during cooking. Sprinkle with a little sugar.\n\nBake until the crust is golden brown and crisp, 35 - 40 minutes.
