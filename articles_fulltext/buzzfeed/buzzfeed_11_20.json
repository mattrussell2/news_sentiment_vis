And while Imake the intrusive questions or awkward dynamics go away, Isuggest some little tricks, icebreakers, conversation topics , and games that'll make everyone have fun (?!). Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash\n\nGetty Images\n\nAnd work in an icebreaker or several. A few \"Name one interesting fact about yourself\" prompts too many have sullied the good name of icebreakers, but it's not too late to rehab their reputation. It doesn't help that the word \"icebreaker\" itself is a misnomer. Like, surely the ice has been broken (albeit perhaps re-frozen) among family? Regardless, if you think of these questions instead as room-warmers, maybe you'll feel more positively toward them. If not, surely these specific room-warmers will appeal to you: \u2022 If you could, would you have a personal trainer, personal chef, housekeeper, or personal glam squad? \u2022 If you could pick up a new skill in an instant, what would it be? \u2022 What's your favorite word? \u2022 What song would you pick to play as you walked up to bat at a professional baseball game? \u2022 We all know about red flags, but what do you consider to be a \"green\" flag when you meet a new person? \u2022 Ignoring your actual age, is there an age you feel like you're stuck at? \u2022 What's your favorite condiment? \u2022 How do you like your eggs? \u2022 Would you rather only be able to use toilet paper as paper towels, or vice versa? \u2022 What's one place you've never been that you'd like to travel to, and one you've been to and want to go back to? Basically, make it light, unexpected, and narrow enough that it won't take forever for people to think of an answer. And if none of those work for you, one of these or these will surely do. You can try these out in one-on-one conversations, or kick off the whole event with one. It's really your call. And if you're feeling awkward about launching one out of the blue with a family that doesn't really do things like this regularly, you can always lead with something like, \"Some of my friends/coworkers and I were discussing this question the other day and I'm still thinking about it\" to make it feel a little more natural.\n\nViewapart / Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes time for dinner, guide the conversation with a topic that's deep, weird, thought-provoking, or maybe all three. Room-warmers are great and all, but they aren't designed to sustain an engaging conversation for more than a few minutes. Beyond that, they generally don't get too deep \u2014 and really, we often don't know our family or friends as well as we think we do (or want to). These topics might help, though: \u2022 Ask everyone to share what they're proud of, but never have an excuse to talk about. Sure, this sets things up to be a bragging contest, but it also sets up a way for people to share what really matters to them. Sometimes, it can be hard to understand people's motivations, which can lead to conflict and frustration, but this can be a way to hear what they consider to be a foundational part of what makes them them. And if they say something cool, then you\u2019ll get to brag/talk about their story in the future. \u2022 If that seems like a guaranteed way to to turn everyone into intolerable braggarts, go around and say your favorite thing about each person in the room. My friends and I did this at a gathering a few years ago, and it was so earnest and heartwarming. I found out that I spend shockingly little time thinking about the specific things that make me like each of them individually, and this was a delightful way to spread warm-fuzzies and feel gratitude for loved ones. \u2022 15 Toasts: As Priya Parker explains in her book The Art of Gathering , this is when everyone in a group of people (it can be more or less than 15, FYI) shares a toast to a particular theme. The theme can be the good life, friendship, values, trust, the list goes on. Each person's toast can be as short or long as they'd like, but the kicker is that the last person to give a toast has to sing theirs. You'll be surprised at the depth and variety you'll get from each person's story, and thanks to the singing aspect, people will be eager to share.\n\nAnd when there's some downtime, opt for a game or activity that actually everyone will enjoy, I promise. There's bound to be people of all ages and abilities, but keeping some go-to diversions in your back pocket will come in handy when you're bored, overstimulated, annoyed, or if you're really lucky, all three! Some favorites: \u2022 Celebrity: This is a fantastic group game, and all you need for it is some pens, paper, and a bowl/hat/vessel that can hold a bunch of slips of paper. Each person writes down 3-5 names on pieces of paper, and the names can be anyone \u2014 family members, celebrities, fictional characters, historical figures, just anyone that everyone in the group will know. All of the papers go into the bowl, the group divides into two teams, and then everyone takes turns describing the name on each piece of paper to their team until the bowl is empty. Then, they all go back in the bowl, and in round two, everyone describes the names on the papers using just two words. In round three, people act out the names using charades. \u2022 Codenames: I've spent a majority of 2018 bullying everyone I know into learning how to play this game, and not one person hasn't loved it. It's a word association game that's ideal for 4-10 people, it's relatively easy to learn how to play, and it gets even better when you're really on the same wavelength as someone else on your team. I can't do the rules justice, so read them here. \u2022 Create a quiz to see who knows a beloved family member best. Cup of Jo recently shared a template of this sweet way to honor and celebrate someone in your family (and complete for prizes based on who knows the most). \u2022 Any of these fun, silly family party games. \u2022 A puzzle...but if there are little kids with grabby fingers loitering around, maybe think twice about this option (or put it on a really high table). \u2022 Have everyone take a personality test and discuss their results. Some favorites include 16Personalities, Enneagram, and 5 Love Languages. \u2022 Or you can have everyone figure out their astrological birth chart.

It doesn't fade, or crack and stays on through sleeping, or tears. Very very smudge proof and it does not flake AT ALL. It dries quickly and even though it is waterproof (as long as you don't touch it excessively) it stays. It's also easy to clean off at the end of the day. No hard scrubbing to get it off, makeup wipes will take it off easily. It's amazing for creating perfect wings, or drawing artfully for Halloween. It's perfect for everyday from subtle looks, to more creative and wild. I usually use black eyeliner, so I decided to get a more expensive, higher end brand, popular eyeliner. I most was not disappointed. I can use this eyeliner for months at a time (at least doing wings every day or so) without having to repurchase because it has dried out or was empty. Just shake before using each time, and it should last for several months, (2-5) depending on the usage daily and if it is stored/used properly.\" \u2014Chick\n\nThis won best mid-price liquid eyeliner on BuzzFeed Reviews!"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Remee Patel", "title": "Stay In A Luxury Hotel And We'll Give You A Vacation Idea", "description": "Practice for the real thing.

Logan Nolin / Unsplash Parece que, para criar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es ideais para dormir bem, precisa levar em considera\u00e7\u00e3o um milh\u00e3o de coisinhas, desde a temperatura at\u00e9 a ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o, passando pelo que comemos e bebemos antes da hora de dormir. Mas como seria esse tal ambiente IDEAL para o sono? O dr. Charles Czeisler, diretor da Divis\u00e3o de Transtornos Circadianos e do Sono do hospital Brigham and Women de Boston, e a dra. Rebecca Robbins, da Universidade Langone em Nova York, para descobrir tudo o que precisamos fazer para ter a melhor noite de sono da nossa vida.\n\n1. Fa\u00e7a o poss\u00edvel para manter o barulho do ambiente abaixo dos 60 decib\u00e9is. \"Qualquer som acima de 60 decib\u00e9is pode interferir seriamente no seu sono,\" segundo Robbins. Isso significa que qualquer som mais alto do que uma conversa em voz baixa, o zunido de uma geladeira ou um aparelho de ar-condicionado precisa ser interrompido ou bloqueado o m\u00e1ximo poss\u00edvel. (Para dar ainda mais contexto, a sirene de uma ambul\u00e2ncia tem cerca de 120 decib\u00e9is, portanto, se voc\u00ea regularmente as ouve de dentro do seu quarto, a chance de ter dificuldades para dormir \u00e9 grande.) \"Muita gente acredita dormir melhor com a televis\u00e3o ligada, mas durante os est\u00e1gios mais leves do sono, qualquer um pode ser perturbado at\u00e9 mesmo pelo ru\u00eddo mais baixo,\" disse Robbins. \"Se voc\u00ea acha mais f\u00e1cil pegar no sono ouvindo o som de uma TV, m\u00fasica ou podcast, n\u00e3o esque\u00e7a de programar ele para que desligue sozinho depois de um tempo, para que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o seja perturbado enquanto passa pelos est\u00e1gios mais leves do sono durante a noite.\"\n\n2. E caso isso n\u00e3o seja poss\u00edvel na sua casa, experimente usar protetores auditivos ou colocar um \"ru\u00eddo branco\" para tocar. Protetores auditivos s\u00e3o uma \u00f3tima solu\u00e7\u00e3o para a polui\u00e7\u00e3o sonora, pois sua fun\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 abafar sons em vez de mascar\u00e1-los com ainda mais barulho, mas nem todo mundo consegue dormir com eles. Caso n\u00e3o consiga, Robbins sugere colocar pra tocar um ru\u00eddo branco ou rosa. \"O ru\u00eddo branco \u00e9 essencialmente ru\u00eddo de fundo, enquanto o ru\u00eddo rosa \u00e9 um som mais natural, como sons de floresta, chuva ou vento. Tamb\u00e9m h\u00e1 evid\u00eancias que sugerem que o ru\u00eddo rosa possa ser algo realmente ben\u00e9fico de se ouvir, mesmo que o barulho n\u00e3o esteja atrapalhando seu sono,\" disse Robbins. Voc\u00ea pode encontrar esses sons no Spotify ou no YouTube.\n\n3. N\u00e3o tome banho quente imediatamente antes de se deitar. Tomar um banho muito quente pode causar um pico na sua temperatura corporal, o que significa que logo depois seu corpo ter\u00e1 que se esfor\u00e7ar para se regular e encontrar de conforto t\u00e9rmico natural.\n\nMink Mingle / Unsplash\n\n4. Decore seu quarto com cores suaves e neutras que transmitam sensa\u00e7\u00f5es de aconchego e relaxamento. \"As cores podem fazer uma grande diferen\u00e7a,\" diz Robbins. \"Quando voc\u00ea est\u00e1 no seu quarto, voc\u00ea realmente quer relaxar, portanto pense em tons neutros como bege, azul claro ou tons past\u00e9is. \u00c9 bom evitar quaisquer cores vivas ou excessivamente berrantes como verde vivo ou vermelho, por exemplo.\"\n\n5. E ao dormir, mantenha seu quarto o mais pr\u00f3ximo poss\u00edvel da escurid\u00e3o completa. \"Um quarto escuro diz ao seu c\u00e9rebro que \u00e9 hora de dormir. Quando voc\u00ea for apagar as luzes, \u00e9 bom garantir que o quarto esteja completamente escuro,\" diz Robbins. \"\u00c9 melhor tentar bloquear qualquer luz vinda da rua ou at\u00e9 mesmo a luz piscante do aparelho de TV ou do computador. Os pequenos detalhes realmente importam, portanto, tente escurecer seu quarto o m\u00e1ximo poss\u00edvel.\" Caso isso n\u00e3o seja poss\u00edvel para voc\u00ea, opte por uma m\u00e1scara para dormir sob a qual voc\u00ea possa piscar, de modo a n\u00e3o atrapalhar o movimento ocular que ocorre durante os diferentes per\u00edodos do sono.\n\nBelchonock / Getty Images\n\n6. E prefira l\u00e2mpadas quentes de baixa voltagem a LEDs excessivamente brilhantes no quarto. Segundo a Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do Sono dos EUA, LEDs n\u00e3o s\u00e3o ideais para o quarto ou banheiro, apesar de economizarem energia. Essas luzes brilhantes emitem luz azul nociva (que nem seu celular e outras telas) que pode interferir seriamente na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de melatonina, fazendo seu c\u00e9rebro pensar que ainda \u00e9 dia. No lugar delas, a sugest\u00e3o \u00e9 usar l\u00e2mpadas incandescentes, que emitem uma luz quente e suave, ou instalar l\u00e2mpadas vermelhas ou cor-de-rosa \u2014 ou at\u00e9 mesmo luzes de Natal \u2014 no seu quarto.\n\nWarchi / Getty Images\n\n7. Em vez de dormir at\u00e9 tarde nos fins de semana, prefira tirar uma soneca \u00e0 tarde. Se voc\u00ea trabalha de segunda a sexta, \u00e9 prov\u00e1vel que acorde todos os dias na mesma hora quando precisa estudar ou trabalha. Mas, nos fins de semana, a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 bem diferente. Contudo, dormir at\u00e9 tarde no s\u00e1bado e no domingo n\u00e3o \u00e9 o ideal para um sono saud\u00e1vel. Em vez disso, Robbins sugere acordar na mesma hora que voc\u00ea acordaria durante a semana e ent\u00e3o tirar uma soneca \u00e0 tarde caso precise dormir mais. \"Mesmo que voc\u00ea tenha ido dormir mais tarde do que de costume e esteja exausto, se force a sair da cama no hor\u00e1rio normal e depois tire uma soneca durante a tarde,\" disse Robbins. \"Isso vai te ajudar muito, porque seu rel\u00f3gio biol\u00f3gico ir\u00e1 iniciar pela manh\u00e3 e far\u00e1 a contagem regressiva at\u00e9 a hora de ir dormir, mantendo seu hor\u00e1rio de sono consistente. A soneca vai compensar o seu d\u00e9ficit de sono sem a consequ\u00eancia de desregular seu hor\u00e1rio.\"\n\n8. Tente ficar de olho na vida \u00fatil do seu colch\u00e3o e travesseiros, e troque quando eles j\u00e1 estiverem muito gastos. Mesmo quem dorme mal ainda passa bastante tempo na cama, seja lendo, assistindo ao Netflix ou, sabe como \u00e9, deitadas se virando de um lado pro outro esperando o sono finalmente chegar. Todo esse tempo na cama desgasta e deforma seu colch\u00e3o e travesseiros, o que afeta sua qualidade e conforto. \"Muita gente nem lembra quando foi que comprou seu colch\u00e3o,\" disse Robbins. \"Um bom colch\u00e3o n\u00e3o dura para sempre, a vida \u00fatil dele \u00e9 por volta de oito anos. Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 importante pensar em renovar seus travesseiros, porque at\u00e9 o melhor deles s\u00f3 se manter nas melhores condi\u00e7\u00f5es por mais ou menos um ano e meio.\"\n\nToa Heftiba / Unsplash\n\n9. Tenha uma rotina de prepara\u00e7\u00e3o pro sono, e fa\u00e7a com que ela seja o mais aconchegante poss\u00edvel. Uma boa rotina antes de ir dormir n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas algo que acontece, mas que exige inten\u00e7\u00e3o e pr\u00e1tica. Ela pode, contudo, fazer toda a diferen\u00e7a ao preparar sua mente e seu corpo para dormir. \"Tire um tempo para se dedicar a uma rotina bem relaxante antes de ir dormir: acenda uma vela cheirosa ou leia algumas p\u00e1ginas de um livro. Pense bem:qual a melhor forma de relaxar e me preparar para a noite adiante?,\" disse Robbins.\n\n10. Fa\u00e7a exerc\u00edcios f\u00edsicos regularmente, mas n\u00e3o imediatamente antes de ir dormir, se for algu\u00e9m que n\u00e3o consegue relaxar \u00e0 noite. \"Exerc\u00edcio \u00e9 \u00f3timo, pois libera endorfinas, que tamb\u00e9m elevam o humor e reduzem o estresse. Provavelmente seja por isso que as pessoas que se exercitam dormem melhor regularmente,\" disse Robbins. \"Quanto a que horas se exercitar, h\u00e1 evid\u00eancias de que realmente n\u00e3o importa se voc\u00ea se exercitar antes de ir dormir. Mas, caso tenha dificuldades para relaxar e desacelerar seus batimentos card\u00edacos \u00e0 noite, talvez seja melhor fazer seu treino mais cedo durante o dia.\" Basicamente, ou\u00e7a o seu corpo, e caso tenha dificuldade para dormir ap\u00f3s um treino noturno, experimente mudar sua rotina e se exercitar durante a manh\u00e3 ou o in\u00edcio da tarde.\n\nGuillermo Nolasco / Unsplash\n\n11. N\u00e3o beba \u00e1lcool antes de ir para a cama, mesmo que isso te ajude a pegar no sono. \"O \u00e1lcool \u00e9 um depressor do sistema nervoso central, portanto apesar de ele realmente ajudar a relaxar, ele tamb\u00e9m perturba o sono e leva a despertares noturnos. Caso planeje beber, seria melhor consumir \u00e1lcool mais cedo durante o dia e ao entardecer, de forma que na hora de ir dormir voc\u00ea tenha um n\u00edvel zero de \u00e1lcool no sangue,\" disse Czeisler.\n\n12. Tamb\u00e9m procure evitar alimentos e bebidas ricos em a\u00e7\u00facar Quanto mais a\u00e7\u00facar ingerir durante o dia, maior \u00e9 a chance de voc\u00ea acordar ou sair do est\u00e1gio de sono profundo durante a noite, j\u00e1 que ele causa picos nos seus n\u00edveis de energia.\n\nJessica Knowlden / Unsplash\n\n13. Deixe seus bichinhos de estima\u00e7\u00e3o do lado de fora. Animais s\u00e3o \u00f3timos! Melhor coisa! Mas uma coisa na qual eles s\u00e3o especialmente \u00f3timos \u00e9 perturbar o seu sono. Como a buzina de um carro ou uma luz piscante, um c\u00e3o ou gato pulando ou se mexendo na cama pode e vai te acordar, ent\u00e3o \u00e9 melhor eles passarem a noite fora do seu quarto.\n\n14. E para melhorar mesmo a qualidade seu sono, o jeito \u00e9 n\u00e3o fumar cigarros. O fumo n\u00e3o s\u00f3 torna mais dif\u00edcil pegar no sono, como tamb\u00e9m dificulta o despertar durante a manh\u00e3, uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o realmente terr\u00edvel. Estudos descobriram que fumar cigarros pode intensificar os pesadelos e a sonol\u00eancia excessiva durante o dia. Caso esteja procurando por mais um motivo para parar de fumar, a\u00ed est\u00e1.\n\nA prop\u00f3sito, caso esteja tendo dificuldade persistente para dormir, vale a pena consultar um m\u00e9dico. V\u00e1rias coisas causam ins\u00f4nia, desde o estresse at\u00e9 certos transtornos, e o um m\u00e9dico \u00e9 a pessoa mais indicada para te ajudar a descobrir o que est\u00e1 acontecendo e a ter o sono de que voc\u00ea precisa.\n\nVeja tamb\u00e9m:"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Maitland Quitmeyer", "title": "29 Products That'll Make You Say \"Damn, I Didn't Know Cleaning Was So Easy!\"", "description": "Clean homes, full hearts, can't lose!

I like the fact that this product is 100% distilled rose water \u2014 no other chemicals or ingredients. My face is ultra sensitive and EVERYTHING causes inflammation, so I wasn't sure how I was going to react to this product. I am pleased to say that after only using this for one day, my redness decreased by about 40%. The acne began to dry up, but my skin did not!

This little appliance helps expand our menu and I have learned to do so much with it. I will sum up in a nutshell, I love how easy it is and how when I throw everything in, it comes out done. No stirring and not many messy dishes. I still don't love it for meats (which I don't eat much of anyway), but I think that's just a matter of needing to experiment more with them.
