I knew I wanted to get stickers of my husband's face, but that wasn't enough. I needed MORE. As I scrolled through the pictures on my phone, I saw it. It was fate. There before me was the screenshot I had taken of one of my little sister's most embarrassing Snapchat selfies. I knew in that moment that this beautiful image had to be immortalized in sticker form! When the stickers came in the mail, I ripped open the package as fast as I could. What greeted me was the face of an angel! I have not laughed that hard in a very, very long time. Every time I look at these stickers, I can't help but smile. I plan to put the largest sticker on a mug for my sister's husband. I know a lot of people get these stickers made of their pets faces, but think outside the box! Do you have an embarrassing photo of a friend or family member where they're making a funny/weird face?

Aprendi a costurar vendo minha m\u00e3e e depois implorei por uma m\u00e1quina de costura no meu anivers\u00e1rio de 14 anos. E adorei costurar. A atividade me permitia meditar com meus pr\u00f3prios pensamentos e me concentrar em algo criativo. Confesso: nunca fiz nenhuma pe\u00e7a maravilhosa do zero, mas esse n\u00e3o \u00e9 o ponto. O ponto \u00e9 ter um kit de costura que voc\u00ea saiba usar.\n\nImagine as pequenas emerg\u00eancias que podem ser facilmente resolvidas se voc\u00ea tiver apenas um kit de costura \u00e0 m\u00e3o. Quando sa\u00ed de f\u00e9rias, por exemplo, o el\u00e1stico do meu biqu\u00edni saiu e ficou para fora. Adivinha quem estava l\u00e1 para me salvar? O meu humilde kit de costura, que comprei por menos de dez reais. Meu doce e lindo kit de costura e a minha habilidade b\u00e1sica de costura fizeram com que eu deixasse de ser uma pessoa que n\u00e3o usaria mais biqu\u00edni pelo resto das f\u00e9rias.\n\nMesmo em situa\u00e7\u00f5es mais comuns, costurar \u00e9 crucial porque, na verdade, faz voc\u00ea economizar dinheiro. Fazer a bainha das sua pr\u00f3pria cal\u00e7a n\u00e3o leva muito tempo e \u00e9 relativamente f\u00e1cil \u2013 e voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisar\u00e1 pagar algu\u00e9m para fazer isso. Al\u00e9m disso, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem que sair da sua casa para consert\u00e1-la, um privil\u00e9gio e tanto se voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m sofre de pregui\u00e7a, assim como eu.\n\nCosturar far\u00e1 voc\u00ea economizar de formas que nem esperava. Voc\u00ea pode comprar roupas levemente maiores porque sabe que pode faz\u00ea-las ficarem bem em voc\u00ea. Se seu corpo mudar de tamanho, voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 ajustar suas roupas, em vez de se desfazer delas. N\u00e3o termina a\u00ed: voc\u00ea ver\u00e1 como z\u00edperes quebrados podem ser substitu\u00eddos, como o forro pode ser refeito, como bolsas rasgadas podem ser consertadas, e, \u00e9 claro, pode come\u00e7ar a cobrar seus amigos para consertar as roupas deles para uma graninha extra.\n\nSe isso ainda n\u00e3o for motivo suficiente, que tal costurar para ajudar o planeta? Em vez de jogar fora suas roupas, voc\u00ea pode aprender como consert\u00e1-las. Parece dif\u00edcil, mas na verdade n\u00e3o \u00e9, j\u00e1 que existe o mundo dos tutoriais do YouTube.\n\nDe acordo com a Ag\u00eancia de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental dos EUA, os aterros receberam 10,5 milh\u00f5es de toneladas de t\u00eaxteis em 2015. Voc\u00ea ver\u00e1 que suas roupas durar\u00e3o muito mais tempo quando aprender a mant\u00ea-las. Consertar o forro e substituir os el\u00e1sticos significar\u00e1 roupas com vida \u00fatil maior, ou seja, voc\u00ea diminuir\u00e1 sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o de lixo.\n\nEntendo que nem todo mundo tem tempo, energia ou habilidade para costurar suas pr\u00f3prias roupas, mas da pr\u00f3xima vez que um bot\u00e3o cair do seu blazer favorito ou voc\u00ea precisar fazer a bainha da sua cal\u00e7a, por favor, considere comprar uma agulha e uma linha. Voc\u00ea economizar\u00e1 dinheiro, contribuir\u00e1 para a preserva\u00e7\u00e3o do planeta e se distrair\u00e1 um pouco enquanto aprende algo novo."}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Jame Jackson", "title": "Prepare A Thanksgiving Meal And We'll Reveal What City You Are Destined To Live In", "description": "Thanksgiving prep says everything about you.

Ele \u00e9 dois anos e meio mais velho do que eu e trabalha como ginecologista e obstetra em Paradise, Calif\u00f3rnia (EUA), duas horas ao norte da cidade onde moro. N\u00f3s nos vemos com frequ\u00eancia, e os tr\u00eas filhos dele costumam brincar com os meus quatro. Somos mais do que irm\u00e3o, somos amigos. Amigos muito, muito pr\u00f3ximos. Minhas m\u00e3os tremiam. Meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o acelerava. Eu j\u00e1 estava preparada para a morte. Eu j\u00e1 estava preparada para algo que n\u00e3o deveria acontecer. Eu odiei minha m\u00e3e por me contar aquilo. Eu a odiei por n\u00e3o me contar mais nada. \u201cEle est\u00e1 vivo?\u201d \u2013 eu mal conseguia falar, mas sabe-se l\u00e1 como gritei. \u201cEle conseguiu sair? O que ele vai fazer?\u201d \u201cEu n\u00e3o sei\u201d, ela respondeu. \u201cA liga\u00e7\u00e3o caiu.\u201d Ele contou \u00e0 minha m\u00e3e que o para-choque do carro estava derretendo diante dos seus olhos. Ele disse que estava a poucos metros de pr\u00e9dios em chamas e que a fuma\u00e7a havia feito o dia parecer noite. Ele disse que estava na Pentz Road. Que estava com muito medo. E ent\u00e3o a liga\u00e7\u00e3o caiu.\n\nVoc\u00ea volta ao in\u00edcio do amor, da hist\u00f3ria, at\u00e9 que a pessoa que pode morrer \u2013 ou morreu \u2013 toma conta de todo o seu ser.\n\nEu nos vi ainda crian\u00e7as. Ele n\u00e3o era mais um homem crescido: ele era meu irm\u00e3o mais velho de d\u00e9cadas atr\u00e1s, antes de termos quarenta anos, antes de termos filhos. Ele era o menino com quem eu brincava na praia, com quem eu jogava Tetris no Nintendo, o que fazia macarr\u00e3o de forno para n\u00f3s nas noites em que mam\u00e3e n\u00e3o estava em casa. Nos vi vendo os Beastie Boys na MTV. Roubando o sinal da TV a cabo dos vizinhos quando n\u00e3o t\u00ednhamos condi\u00e7\u00f5es de pagar por isso. Caminhando uma eternidade at\u00e9 nossa casa \u2013 pelo menos era o que parecia \u2013 quando sa\u00edamos da escola. As coisas s\u00e3o assim. Voc\u00ea volta ao in\u00edcio de tudo, \u00e0 origem. Voc\u00ea volta ao in\u00edcio do amor, da hist\u00f3ria, at\u00e9 que a pessoa que pode morrer \u2013 ou morreu \u2013 toma conta de todo o seu ser, transformando-se no sangue que corre em suas veias, como se fosse voc\u00ea no cadafalso, como se fosse voc\u00ea que estivesse ficando sem ar. E voc\u00ea tenta se segurar e implora para que tudo volte atr\u00e1s. Volte a como era antes. A poucos minutos antes. S\u00f3 voltar ao que era. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o volta \u00e0s coisas do cotidiano, \u00e0 amizade fr\u00edvola com o papo furado, \u00e0 dist\u00e2ncia e \u00e0s briguinhas. Voc\u00ea volta ao in\u00edcio do amor, para e fica vendo aquilo sendo destru\u00eddo. Sab\u00edamos que a mulher e os filhos do meu irm\u00e3o estavam a salvo, j\u00e1 no caminho para a nossa cidade (Chico). Mas ele estava preso, e sab\u00edamos disso tamb\u00e9m. Liguei para o meu marido e dirigi at\u00e9 a casa da minha m\u00e3e, onde ficamos sentadas como animais enjaulados. Eu checava compulsivamente o Twitter, chorando enquanto via um v\u00eddeo que mostrava a Pentz Road, naquele exato momento, queimando de maneira apocal\u00edptica. Voc\u00ea fica dizendo para si mesma que ele foi um escoteiro condecorado. Voc\u00ea fica dizendo para si mesma que ele \u00e9 sensato. Voc\u00ea fica dizendo para si mesma que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel encontrar uma maneira de escapar de um grande inc\u00eandio. Voc\u00ea fica dizendo para si mesma essas coisas todas, mas n\u00e3o acredita em nenhuma delas. Durante cinco horas, ficamos esperando. Durante cinco horas, ligamos para toda a fam\u00edlia, nos sentimos impotentes. Porque mesmo em momentos assim, ainda somos n\u00f3s. Apenas uma fam\u00edlia. Eu s\u00f3 me desesperei depois de ouvir a voz do nosso pai, uma voz de confian\u00e7a inabal\u00e1vel. \u201cEle est\u00e1 dirigindo por uma \u00e1rea que j\u00e1 queimou, Janelle. Ele est\u00e1 s\u00e3o e salvo.\u201d Isso era evidentemente infundado. Algo criado por um pai aterrorizado, uma certeza imagin\u00e1ria na qual se segurar, porque a alternativa parecia imposs\u00edvel.\n\nTenille Gates O playground na Escola Prim\u00e1ria de Paradise ap\u00f3s o inc\u00eandio.\n\nAp\u00f3s passar duas horas e meia sentado em sua caminhonete, Ross dirigiu 800 metros, lentamente, seguindo no meio da estrada. Ele sabia que o calor do fogo aumenta exponencialmente quanto mais voc\u00ea se aproxima dele, o que significa que 3 metros de dist\u00e2ncia para as chamas consumindo os pr\u00e9dios ao seu redor \u00e9 bem diferente de 1 metro e meio. Por isso, ele n\u00e3o saiu do centro da estrada. Outras pessoas n\u00e3o sabiam disso \u2013 eu mesma n\u00e3o saberia \u2013 e desviavam para o acostamento, para ultrapassar os outros carros ou para ver o que estava acontecendo \u00e0 frente. E, quando faziam isso, \u00e0s vezes seus carros pegavam fogo, for\u00e7ando os ocupantes a abandonarem o ve\u00edculo e correrem. Um dos ve\u00edculos tomado pelas chamas no acostamento era uma ambul\u00e2ncia levando uma mulher que havia acabado de fazer uma ces\u00e1rea no Feather River, o hospital onde meu irm\u00e3o trabalha. Quando a ambul\u00e2ncia pegou fogo, a equipe m\u00e9dica e os pacientes fugiram para uma garagem pr\u00f3xima. L\u00e1, uma enfermeira subiu no telhado e usou uma mangueira para manter as chamas afastadas. Tanto a m\u00e3e quanto o beb\u00ea sobreviveram. Meu irm\u00e3o tirou uma foto da ambul\u00e2ncia em chamas de sua caminhonete. Ao fim dos 800 metros, ele foi direcionado pelos bombeiros para uma via que levava ao estacionamento de um supermercado, onde estacionou a caminhonete (junto com dezenas de outros carros) e ficou aguardando. Um bombeiro estava de p\u00e9 em um caminh\u00e3o de bombeiros, \u00e0 frente de todo mundo, usando sua enorme mangueira para jogar \u00e1gua a leste, circular ao redor de todos os carros para mant\u00ea-los resfriados e depois jogar \u00e1gua a oeste, mantendo as chamas afastadas. Esse era o plano. Se mesmo assim as chamas se aproximassem, os bombeiros construiriam uma barricada com os trailers queimados e fariam todos se amontoarem atr\u00e1s dessa barricada, para tentar bloquear o calor. E era isso. Esse era o \u00fanico plano.\n\nSegurei o rosto do meu irm\u00e3o em minhas m\u00e3os. \u00c9 dif\u00edcil explicar o que senti no momento.\n\nNo dia seguinte, segurei o rosto do meu irm\u00e3o em minhas m\u00e3os. \u00c9 dif\u00edcil explicar o que senti no momento. A fam\u00edlia dele havia perdido a casa, mas n\u00e3o tinha perdido tudo. Pelo menos 79 pessoas morreram no inc\u00eandio Camp Fire, o inc\u00eandio mais avassalador e mortal da hist\u00f3ria da Calif\u00f3rnia. Centenas de pessoas ainda est\u00e3o desaparecidas. Podemos nos considerar pessoas de sorte. Tr\u00eas dias ap\u00f3s o inc\u00eandio, minha cunhada me enviou as fotos compartilhadas por uma amiga que havia voltado \u00e0 cidade com seu marido, um policial. As fotos eram da Escola Prim\u00e1ria de Paradise. Bem, do que havia sobrado dela. A escola foi completamente incinerada \u2013 todos os pr\u00e9dios, todos os brinquedos, todas as salas de aula. Encostado em uma \u00e1rvore no playground da escola prim\u00e1ria, ficava o \u201cBanco da Amizade\u201d. Era o banco para onde as crian\u00e7as iam quando precisavam de um amigo, quando precisavam de algu\u00e9m com quem brincar. Voc\u00ea se lembra dessa sensa\u00e7\u00e3o? De andar sem rumo, vendo as crian\u00e7as brincando ao seu redor, querendo entrar na brincadeira, mas n\u00e3o tendo a coragem de se aproximar? E agora, entre as cinzas e os escombros do playground onde as crian\u00e7as do jardim de inf\u00e2ncia brincavam, entre uma faixa cada vez maior de objetos cinzentos, mortos e indecifr\u00e1veis, ficou esse banco, imaculado.\n\nTenille Gates O Banco da Amizade\n\nDezenas de milhares de hectares ao redor de Paradise foram destru\u00eddos pelo fogo, mas o Banco da Amizade resistiu \u2013 at\u00e9 mesmo a \u00e1rvore na qual ele fica encostado n\u00e3o foi queimada. \u00c9 quase debilmente po\u00e9tico, excessivamente meloso. E \u00e9 silenciosamente importante. Aquele banco parecia gritar algo, de um local muito distante, talvez uma caverna profunda: \u201cIsto \u00e9 o que voc\u00ea tem, cidadezinha nas montanhas. Tem um banco onde pode encontrar algu\u00e9m que tamb\u00e9m precisa de voc\u00ea. Onde voc\u00ea pode sentar quando estiver com medo e ter a certeza de que algu\u00e9m vir\u00e1 em seu aux\u00edlio\u201d. Enquanto o fogo consumia Paradise nas primeiras horas daquele dia, as pessoas foram incr\u00edveis indo ao aux\u00edlio das outras e tendo a certeza de que algu\u00e9m apareceria para ajud\u00e1-las: a treinadora de cavalos, amiga do meu irm\u00e3o, que anotou o n\u00famero do seu telefone no corpo dos cavalos antes de solt\u00e1-los, j\u00e1 que n\u00e3o conseguiria transportar todos. Os homens, mulheres e crian\u00e7as que pegaram carona com algu\u00e9m que tamb\u00e9m estava dirigindo pela estrada em chamas. A enfermeira que deu meia-volta e voltou para Paradise para ajudar os outros. Os 600 estranhos que retu\u00edtaram o tu\u00edte sobre meu irm\u00e3o quando n\u00e3o t\u00ednhamos not\u00edcias dele. As v\u00edtimas do inc\u00eandio do ano passado na Calif\u00f3rnia que enviaram m\u00f3veis e vale-compras para o povo de Paradise. Eu continuo pensando sobre aquele banco que sobreviveu \u00e0s chamas \u2013 um cora\u00e7\u00e3o selvagem no meio de tudo aquilo, ainda de p\u00e9 e bizarramente solit\u00e1rio em um mundo destru\u00eddo, pedindo a n\u00f3s que nos sentemos juntos. Quando minha filha de 8 anos viu o tio, ficou olhando para ele em sil\u00eancio, com os olhos enchendo-se de l\u00e1grimas, at\u00e9 que falou: \u201cTio Ross, eu fiquei com muito medo por voc\u00ea.\u201d Ao que ele respondeu: \u201cEu tamb\u00e9m fiquei.\u201d Ele ent\u00e3o a colocou em seu colo, e os dois ficaram sentados juntos por um bom tempo. \u25cf\n\nJanelle Hanchett \u00e9 a fundadora do blog Renegade Mothering.

Her mother, who had drug and alcohol problems, left Kate and two younger siblings with people she called babysitters. But they were actually just \u201csome of her drunk friends\u201d, Kate says.\n\n\u201cShe left us there for a week or so,\u201d Kate told BuzzFeed News. \u201cBut when they couldn\u2019t look after us any more, they dropped us off out the front of our house.\u201d\n\nKate managed to find a way into the house, but her mother didn\u2019t return home. After a few days neighbours found the kids, who were placed into foster care soon after. Kate says she later found out that her mum had been gang-raped in the meantime, suffering injuries that required surgery.\n\nIn the years since, Kate \u2013 who is Aboriginal \u2013 has lived in 14 foster homes and about seven residential houses. None of her foster families were Indigenous. She\u2019s legally in the care of the NSW family and community services minister Pru Goward.\n\nIn Sydney\u2019s CBD last week she came across a protest outside parliament against amendments to the state\u2019s child protection laws proposed by Goward. The government says the amendments will help children like Kate who bounce from foster home to foster home.\n\nThe law would make it easier to find a permanent placement for children in care by setting a two-year limit on the time families have to win their children back after removal, and making it easier for guardians to adopt kids they\u2019re looking after.\n\nEven though she\u2019s been through so many different homes, Kate is hoping the law doesn\u2019t pass. It scares her, because she is expecting a child of her own in next July.\n\nShe plans to raise the baby with its father, who is also 15 and Aboriginal. He wants to find work in construction, and they\u2019re planning to get an apartment, with the help of an Aboriginal youth services program.\n\n\u201cBy the time we get an apartment we will know the gender and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll start buying nappies and clothes and stuff,\u201d she said. They\u2019ll be supported by the father\u2019s family and the youth services program.\n\nBut as Kate enters her second trimester of pregnancy, the debate around the child protection law is making her nervous.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a DOCS kids myself I\u2019ll be on what they call the danger zone, DOCS will be on me 24/7,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because me and my partner are Aboriginal, it\u2019ll probably be taken.\u201d\n\nHer Aboriginal identity \u201cmeans a lot\u201d, she says. \u201cEveryone pictures us as bad. So I want to show people that Aboriginals aren\u2019t just bad.\" She thinks raising a happy family is one way to do that.\n\nThe debate about the law makes her \u201cscared\u201d of what will happen if her baby is removed. She\u2019s afraid that if it passes, she won\u2019t be able to win her child back or keep in contact if it\u2019s taken.\n\nWhen Kate posted a flyer from the rally on Facebook, she says her other Aboriginal friends in the care system reacted with fear and anger.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason why she is sceptical of the plan to make adoptions easier. Kate\u2019s youngest two siblings, who are seven and four, have been adopted into the same family (her other two siblings live together with another foster family). She didn\u2019t know about the adoption before it happened, and she\u2019s not allowed any in-person contact with them. With a lawyer\u2019s help, she\u2019s considering going to court to try to gain access to them.\n\n\u201cThey mean a lot,\u201d she said of her siblings. \u201cI\u2019d do anything to have a family.\u201d\n\nKate has been living in a residential house in Western Sydney for the last month \u2013 she says it\u2019s the best she\u2019s been in so far \u2013 after running away from her last residential house and spending a few weeks on the streets and in crisis accommodation. She has no contact with her mother, who is in and out of jail.\n\nIf she pictures the best version of her future in a year or two, this is what Kate says she sees: \u201cI have a nice, happy family, and my siblings can all come together and I get to see them.\u201d\n\nThe Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Amendment Bill passed the upper house last week, and is expected to return to the lower house for debate later today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Sarah Han", "title": "Time To Upgrade Your Skincare Routine, Because Foreo Products Are Up To 30% Off!", "description": "Your skincare goals are in reach and cheaper than ever.

Reports stated that after landing Lawrence ran through the airport to a car, where she was joined by family and friends before leaving the airport.\n\nNSW Police said last week there were \"two outstanding warrants\" for a 41-year-old woman related to a high speed chase in a stolen car from before Lawrence travelled to Bali in 2005, but police did not detain her at the airport on Thursday.\n\nNSW police commissioner Mick Fuller indicated on Tuesday that police would negotiate with Lawrence's lawyers \"to bring her in and have those warrants satisfied\".\n\nLawrence was freed from prison by the Indonesian government on Wednesday. She was caught with 2.7kg of heroin at Bali airport in 2005, and was subsequently sentenced to 20 years in jail as part of a conspiracy to import 8.2kg of the drug. Lawrence's good behaviour behind bars led authorities to cut almost seven years off her sentence.\n\nBali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed in 2015, despite pleas from the Australian government and campaigns in Australia to spare the men.

The listeners who heard these recordings rated the credibility of the researcher and the studies they were discussing as significantly less favourable than recordings with higher audio quality.\n\nThe study involved 97 participants, who were instructed to listen to recordings of different pieces of science news and assess the quality of the research and the researcher who was reporting it.\n\nA study published in March found that people were less likely to believe an academic researcher on the radio if the audio quality of the recording was poor or glitchy.\n\nA mounting body of scientific evidence is showing that people's assessments of whether or not something is true is really easily manipulated by cues as simple as photographs, or good-quality audio.\n\nNewman's research focuses on the idea of \"truthiness\" \u2013 a term borrowed from the 2005 pilot episode of Stephen Colbert's Comedy Central TV show The Colbert Report.\n\n\n\nThe concept of \"truthiness\" is all about intuition: believing something to be true doesn't rest on critical analysis, it is mediated by automatic cognitive processes.\n\n\"Truthiness\" is less about thought and more about emotional response \"because that's where the truth comes from ladies and gentlemen, the gut,\" said Colbert.\n\n\"What we find in our research really robustly is that we can push around people's feelings of truth using things like photographs and audio quality, and even the ease of pronouncing someone's name,\" said Newman.\n\nIn 2012 Newman co-authored another paper with studies that found photographs can inflate the sense of \"truthiness\" that people get from reading a statement.\n\nThe sort of photographs that the researchers used for this research were \"non-probative\", meaning that they didn't actually contain any information about the claims being made.\n\nOne study included in the paper found that if participants were given a trivia statement such as \"Macadamia nuts are in the same evolutionary family as peaches\", they were more likely to believe the statement was true if a photograph of macadamias simply appeared alongside the sentence.\n\nNewman said the effects of the photographs surprised her because they weren't using images that were helpful at all.\n\nIn 2014 Newman led another study that found if claims came from authors with names that were easier to pronounce, people were more likely to believe those statements as fact.\n\nWhile this could be construed as a product of xenophobia, the ease of pronounciation effect was seen across the globe and even within different regions of the same country.\n\nOur criteria for judging truth appears to come from social consensus (if others believe it), compatibility with what people already believe, coherence of the story, the source of the information, and supporting evidence.\n\n\n\nThe ease of cognitive processing when it comes to digesting a statement also has a huge impact, and that's why photographs, audio quality and the author's name can all factor into people's decisions about truth, says Newman.\n\nNewman is worried about the consequences that these biases have as people increasingly consume their news on social media platforms.\n\n\n\n\"I think the speed at which we're processing information is a huge factor here. People are more likely to make errors when they're making quick decisions about what they encounter.\"\n\nAs it turns out, people are also really poor at self-regulating their decisions about whether or not to believe statements.\n\nNewman notes that in her research, she asks participants at the end of experiments to assess whether or not they were manipulated by imagery or the quality of audio, and that people are rarely aware of these biases in their decision-making.\n\n\"It's quite insidious in the way that it forces people's decisions, that's what scares me,\" she said.\n\nNewman says this makes it difficult to produce guidelines on how to avoid believing fake headlines.\n\n\"Last year I saw this happening a lot, the media were coming out with a recipe to detect fake news ... things like, 'Think more critically', and when you give people that advice, as it turns out it doesn't actually protect them from some of the cognitive biases we see.\"\n\nNewman and a team of researchers at ANU are now conducting studies on how to combat these manipulations and make people more discerning about their choices around belief."}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "sjh7628", "title": "We Know Which 2018 Ariana Grande Lyric You Are Based On Your Fave Movies Of The Year", "description": "\"I'm so f*ckin' grateful...\" View Entire Post \u203a", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/sjh7628/we-know-what-2018-ariana-grande-lyric-you-are-base-3lhzy", "urlToImage": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-11/22/13/tmp/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/e22a08f552084a6127ca665d9f31af3b-4.jpg?crop=623:326;2,0", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T02:13:57Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?
