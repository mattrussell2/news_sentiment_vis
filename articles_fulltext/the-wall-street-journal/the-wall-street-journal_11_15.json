Restaurants and new infrastructure are likely to follow\u2014what some Seattleites call the Amazon prosperity bomb\u2014but the invasion of workers will also bring traffic jams and a jump in housing prices.\n\nCustomers browse an Amazon Go store in downtown Seattle, near the company\u2018s sprawling headquarters. Photo: lindsey wasson/Reuters\n\nThe company announced Tuesday that it will divide its second headquarters evenly between New York\u2019s Long Island City and Northern Virginia, with some 25,000 employees in each location. In a more than yearlong public contest, metro areas across the U.S. had offered the company lucrative financial incentives, lured by the prospect of investment, high-wage workers and a surge of businesses to support them.\n\nIn Seattle, Amazon rewrote the book on how a big company makes its home in an urban area, putting thousands of employees in the downtown core rather than a suburban campus.\n\nNew York and Arlington, Va., traded billions of dollars in incentives for a shiny new Amazon HQ2. But the arrival of the new corporate headquarters could mean some serious challenges for the two cities.\n\nAs Amazon\u2019s workforce in the city center has increased more than ninefold over the past decade, to 45,000, the number of restaurants and other food-service businesses in the city has jumped 27%, according to data from the Washington State Department of Revenue.\n\nOverall, Amazon\u2019s workforce accounted for roughly 8% of the 581,780 total jobs in Seattle in 2017, according to data from the Puget Sound Regional Council.\n\nLines of workers waiting for burgers, sandwiches and burritos stream down city streets at lunchtime. Mr. Douglas says the Amazon workers who flood his downtown restaurants skew young and eschew lavish meals and expensive cocktails.\n\nAmazon offers free bananas near its sprawling campus in downtown Seattle. Photo: Paul Gordon/Zuma Press\n\nAmazon\u2019s campus, which spans over several city blocks, has its own banana stands that hand out thousands of free bananas. Some workers have said there is a shortage of bananas at nearby grocery stores as a result.\n\nAmazon\u2019s arrival is likely to strain any city\u2019s mass transit\u2014which could mean much-needed upgrades. The company paid for a fourth streetcar to ease downtown congestion, as part of a deal with Seattle. But riders there have found that buses packed with Amazonians, who receive transit passes from the company, zip past stops during rush hour, unable to fit more passengers.\n\nA Seattle streetcar is wrapped in an ad for Amazon. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press\n\nThat may not bode well for the New York headquarters site. Long Island City\u2019s rush-hour commutes are already nightmarish, with overcrowded subway cars and delays. Another 25,000 employees could further hobble the system, though New York has promised infrastructure upgrades.\n\nThe most striking change Amazon has brought to Seattle is a new skyline. Amazon moved into a ramshackle neighborhood north of downtown called South Lake Union, transforming it from a hodgepodge of parking lots, tire shops and small warehouses into a collection of modern office buildings, apartments and teeming restaurants.\n\n\u201cIt was a pit,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington and author of \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America,\u201d due out next year. \u201cThey are having an impact on the city that\u2019s positive and generative.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the rapid growth of Amazon\u2019s footprint downtown has created its own set of challenges, Ms. O\u2019Mara said. Unlike Microsoft Corp. , which built its main campus in the suburb of Redmond, and Boeing Co. , whose factories are in nearby Everett and Renton, Amazon\u2019s offices are close to Seattle\u2019s sports venues, museums and auditoriums. About 15% of Amazon\u2019s Seattle workforce live within the same ZIP Code as their office, and 20% walk to work, according to the company. While their presence has spurred the arrival of bike-share services in the city center, traffic barely budges at the end of most work days.\n\nAmazon\u2019s offices are close to many Seattle downtown attractions, snarling traffic on many weekdays. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press\n\nAs Amazon has outgrown South Lake Union, it has expanded into office towers closer in the city center. The company now uses 10 million square feet of Seattle office space, spread out over more than 40 buildings.\n\nSeattle\u2019s economic boom, fueled in part by Amazon\u2019s growth, has put home prices out of reach for many. Seattle led the nation in home-price increases for nearly two years\u2014prices grew 12.8% in the year ending in June\u2014until Las Vegas passed it this summer, according to the monthly S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index.\n\nAmazon\u2019s growing footprint is making it a local political target. It\u2019s not uncommon to see protesters outside Amazon buildings, raising issues from the company\u2019s sale of facial-recognition software to law-enforcement agencies to cargo pilots contracted by the company seeking better pay.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nUltimately, as the so-called HQ2 contest showed, having Amazon come to town is a test cities were more than willing to take on. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has said it would be \u201cthe single biggest economic development deal in the history of New York City.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges that Amazon\u2019s rise has created in Seattle, many politicians there are eager to keep it happy.\n\nIn May, the city passed an \u201cAmazon tax,\u201d a per-employee levy on big companies to fund homeless services, only to repeal the measure a month later after pressure from Amazon and other businesses.\n\nCity leaders don\u2019t hide their pride that Amazon calls Seattle home. So much so that Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said last week, when The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon was splitting HQ2 in two, that was \u201cgood news.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d call those branch offices,\u201d Ms. Durkan told a local television news reporter.\n\nWrite to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Micah Maidenberg", "title": "MoviePass Sheds Subscribers as Troubles Mount", "description": "MoviePass experienced a significant decline in subscribers in the third quarter, the latest sign of trouble for majority owner Helios & Matheson Analytics.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/moviepass-sheds-subscribers-as-owners-troubles-mount-1542321380", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37372/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:36:21Z", "content": "While Helios flagged the drop in a securities filing Thursday, it didnt provide an exact figure.

MoviePass had 3.2 million subscribers as of Aug. 10, compared with 1 million in December 2017, according to an August filing. A spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe decline came after the movie-theater subscription service started limiting customers to viewing three movies a month for $9.95. That is a much more restrictive policy than what the service offered when it launched last year: one movie a day.\n\nHelios said each subscriber, on average, saw 0.77 movies a month in September, down from 0.85 in August and 2.23 in March.\n\nMoviePass also faces rising competition. Movie-theater owner AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. said earlier this month it expects to soon enroll more than half a million people in a service that offers three movies a week at a monthly price of about $20.\n\nOverall for the quarter, Helios lost $130 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with a loss of $43 million, or $5.79 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenues topped $81 million, compared with $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2017.\n\n\u201cWithout raising additional capital, there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern through November 15, 2019,\u201d Helios said in Thursday\u2019s filing.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Helios\u2019s MoviePass segment reported $80.5 million in revenue, up about 10% from the second quarter, according to a statement. The unit reported a gross loss of $28.5 million, improving on the $104.7 million loss in the prior quarter.\n\nAs a result of the decline in subscriptions, Helios recorded an impairment charge of $39 million against the goodwill of the MoviePass unit. Goodwill measures the difference between how much a company paid to buy another firm and the value of the target firm\u2019s hard assets.\n\nShares of Helios closed at 2 cents on Thursday. In October 2017, the company\u2019s stock topped $8,000, but that was before a 1-for-250 reverse stock split, which occurred in July.\n\nAs MoviePass has struggled financially and with service outages, the company has been forced to take out a high-interest loan.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company said in a securities filing it would cancel a shareholder meeting to discuss another stock split because it didn\u2019t expect to have the votes to approve it.\n\nMoviePass has tried to expand into adjacent businesses, acquiring stakes in movies, such as one about New York crime boss John Gotti. The company believes it can draw on its MoviePass subscriber base to drive viewers to such films.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jacob M.

The unemployment rate is at a 49-year low of 3.7%.\n\nTom Thurlow, of iRiS Recruiting Solutions near Indianapolis, said a client hired a systems engineer in August after one phone call and some notes Mr. Thurlow provided. The candidate had experience with software few are familiar with, and the client, in the automotive industry, had to replace a critical employee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had some pretty quick hires, but this is the first time a client hired someone sight unseen,\u201d he said.\n\nCVS Health is piloting a program in which workers at some distribution centers don\u2019t meet with a human until the day they start their jobs. Recruiters base hiring on candidates\u2019 performance in a \u201cvirtual job tryout\u201d and online assessment.\n\nCVS still requires in-person interviews for jobs such as cashiers and corporate positions, said Jeffrey Lackey, vice president of talent acquisition at CVS Health. Reducing the time it takes to hire a qualified employee is critical when an applicant could snag a job elsewhere, he says. \u201cAny recruiter worth their salt knows that time kills all deals.\u201d\n\nMalik Bruce, an 18-year-old who lives near Atlanta, applied in August to work for in-flight caterer Gate Gourmet. The company asked him for a phone interview, but to his surprise, there was no human on the line. Mr. Bruce recorded answers to questions from an automated system asking him to describe himself and his future plans.\n\n\u201cI was confused,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a conversation with a robot.\u201d\n\nHe was invited for an in-person interview, but said when he arrived, he and other applicants were informed they had landed jobs. \u201cWe all kind of looked around at each other, like, I thought this was an interview,\u201d Mr. Bruce said.\n\nMalik Bruce answered questions from an automated system. Photo: Michael Satchwell\n\nTheir offers were conditional on background checks and drug tests, said Mr. Bruce, who has since left the job to pursue a degree in graphic design. Gate Gourmet wouldn\u2019t comment.\n\nAmong the downsides: Phone interviews mean companies don\u2019t know how an employee may interact with colleagues or customers. In addition, \u201cyou aren\u2019t verifying that the person who is on the phone is the person who\u2019s going to show up\u201d for the job, said Kristin Miller, a director of recruiting in Atlanta.\n\nPeter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, said multiple personal interviews are overrated. Most companies, he said, are \u201cso bad at interviewing, and the interviews are so full of bias, that it\u2019s not crazy to just ignore them altogether.\u201d\n\nEven companies with a history of hiring by phone find themselves trying to speed up the process. Wisconsin-based Roehl Transport Inc. hires 2,000 truck drivers annually. Recently, recruiters began pulling driving records and transportation-employment histories while interviewing experienced drivers by phone, to clarify discrepancies in the moment.\n\n\u201cIt is so competitive, we\u2019ve got to be able to make an informed decision as quickly as possible,\u201d says Tim Norlin, the company\u2019s vice president of driver employment."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Lillian Rizzo", "title": "The Wall Street Journal: Judge approves Sears plan to sell its best-performing stores", "description": "Sears Holdings Corp. won court approval to pursue a sale of its best stores, a process that would be the retailer\u2019s only hope of avoiding liquidation.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sears-gets-court-approval-to-sell-stores-1542316919", "urlToImage": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GY673_sears1_ZG_20181115171715.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:25:35Z", "content": "Sears Holdings Corp. won court approval to pursue a sale of its best stores, a process that would be the retailers only hope of avoiding liquidation.

They were targeted under the U.S. government\u2019s authority to target human rights abusers.\n\nLawmakers reacting to the sanctions said the measures were a welcome first step, but only that. Legislators from both parties have urged the Trump administration to take tougher steps against the kingdom, a key U.S. ally.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cEveryone who had a hand in [Mr.] Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder should be subject to strict sanctions, and, as I review this list, it\u2019s clear that it is not comprehensive,\u201d said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.).\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) agreed, saying he urged the Trump administration to continue investigating the killing of Mr. Khashoggi and hold anyone else linked to the case accountable.\n\nMr. Khashoggi was a columnist for the Washington Post and a critic of the Saudi government. He was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 by a team of operatives dispatched by Riyadh. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Mr. Qahtani was intimately involved in the operation.\n\nSaudi Arabia released details about how government critic Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside its consulate in Istanbul. Turkey says there are still many unanswered questions. Photo: AP\n\nHuman rights activists also weren\u2019t satisfied. Rob Berschinski, senior vice president for policy of Human Rights First, said Riyadh is likely sighing with relief at the U.S. sanctions announcement.\n\n\u201cThe administration isn\u2019t taking a particularly strong stand in terms of accountability\u2026no one should describe today\u2019s actions as a win for accountability or human rights,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. officials said Thursday that their probe continues, and they signaled more action could come. The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets of the 17 targeted, block their entry to the U.S. and bar Americans from doing business with them.\n\nRep. Eliot Engel, (D., N.Y.) said the issue isn\u2019t yet put to rest. \u201cIt remains unclear whether the Trump administration has determined who is responsible for this horrific incident. Until responsibility is confirmed, this matter is unresolved and deserves Congress\u2019 scrutiny,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. sanctions came hours after the Saudi kingdom\u2019s prosecutor said he would seek the death penalty for five people it had charged in the case. The office of the prosecutor didn\u2019t release the names of the 11 people charged, and it said another 10 people remain under investigation. The five who face the death penalty confessed to their involvement, the prosecutor said.\n\nThat prosecutor also released more details about what led to Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing, saying the continuing Riyadh investigation had completely exonerated the crown prince.\n\nQuestions over Mr. bin Salman\u2019s involvement, or the lack thereof, has led to some calls for sanctions against the crown prince. But such a step at this point, could be too politically sensitive for the U.S. to take, said Scott R. Anderson, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cSanctioning the deputy head of state of a foreign country, let alone an ally, is a major step and something [the U.S.] wouldn\u2019t pursue without strong evidence and a willingness to see through the political consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at samuel.rubenfeld@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Micah Maidenberg", "title": "Dell Sweetens Tracking-Stock Deal After Facing Shareholder Pressure", "description": "The purchase of DVMT shares would help return the PC maker to public markets after it was taken private in 2013.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dell-sweetens-tracking-stock-deal-after-facing-shareholder-pressure-1542290117", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37216/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:47:00Z", "content": "Dell Technologies Inc.

That is 20.8%, or one out of every five high-school students.\n\nMore than a quarter of those students used e-cigarettes regularly, the survey found. Flavored e-cigarettes, one target of a larger Food and Drug Administration crackdown announced Thursday, grew in popularity.\n\nThe number of U.S. middle schoolers using e-cigarettes rose 48% to 570,000, or 4.9% of that overall student population.\n\nVaping helped drive use of tobacco products overall up 38% among high-school students and by 29% among middle-school students between 2017 and 2018, reversing declines reported over the past several years, the survey showed.\n\n\u201cThe use of any form of tobacco product among youths, including e-cigarettes, is unsafe,\u201d the authors of the study wrote. The survey is conducted annually by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data were published Thursday in the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nThe upward trend in teen use coincided with a sudden increase in the popularity of the Juul, a small, discreet vaporizer made by Juul Labs Inc. that looks like a flash drive and delivers a powerful dose of nicotine from liquid-filled pods, including pods in flavors such as mango and mint. U.S. sales of Juul took off in the second half of 2017 and have been climbing rapidly since then.\n\n\u201cThese products can be used discreetly, have a high nicotine content, and come in flavors that appeal to youths,\u201d the authors of the survey wrote.\n\nThe FDA announced sharp restrictions Thursday on the sale of sweet-flavored, cartridge-style e-cigarettes, limiting them to areas of stores that minors can\u2019t access, or to online sites with strict age verification. The agency is also seeking a ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.\n\n\u201cI will not allow a generation of children to become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said. \u201cWe won\u2019t let this pool of kids, a pool of future potential smokers, of future disease and death, to continue to build.\u201d\n\nBut mint and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes will remain exempt from restrictions, because those flavors are more popular with adults than with teens, and may be important for adult smokers trying to switch to less harmful products, Dr. Gottlieb said.\n\nHe added, though, that if teen use of mint or menthol e-cigarettes doesn\u2019t decline, \u201cI\u2019ll revisit this aspect.\u201d\n\nData show those flavors are popular with kids. More than half (51.2%) of high-school vapers used mint or menthol e-cigarettes in 2018, up from 42.3% in 2017, according to the federal survey.\n\nJuul\u2019s mint was the third most popular flavor among 12- to 17-year-olds, making up 16% of users, in an April survey conducted by the Truth Initiative, an antitobacco group. It was the most popular flavor among 18- to 21-year-olds, making up 32% of users, the group found.\n\nMint or menthol was the flavor that more than a quarter of teens and young adults tried in their first use of pod-based e-cigarettes, according to a study of California teens published in JAMA Network Open, an open access journal published by the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nMint makes up about 35% of Juul Labs\u2019 sales, while menthol and tobacco combined make up 10%, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Lavery.\n\nA Juul Labs spokeswoman said the company has implemented an action plan to combat underage use and is committed to working with the FDA and other agencies and organizations to reduce underage e-cigarette use. Juul Labs said this week it would stop selling flavors such as mango, cucumber and fruit at bricks-and-mortar stores.

First, our current health-care spending per capita is twice that of the average industrialized nation that provides universal health care. That is, there is already more than enough money to go around. The $32 trillion cost he cites would be more than offset by the elimination of insurance and other costs. Second, his frightful narrative about waiting lists ignores that our health outcomes are sometimes worse than in the countries he references. A true advocate for health-care choice within a free market would have no objections to a public option. Why not let the people choose what is best?\n\nFred Kuhar\n\nWickliffe, Ohio\n\nDr. Atlas claims that Medicare for All would provide inferior service, yet Gallup Polls tell us that Medicare and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries approve of their systems by 79% versus the roughly 65% approval of those in the private, non-Medicare system and 41% of the uninsured. Dr. Atlas need not look to Europe to justify his claim. The U.S. provides proof enough of Medicare\u2019s adequacy.\n\nAs the party of fiscal responsibility, Republicans should jump at the chance to offset the next decade\u2019s budget deficits threefold and simultaneously solve the unsustainable situation of the Medicare trust fund. This is surely preferable to ObamaCare\u2019s shameless giveaway to the insurance and health-care industries.\n\nNonetheless, there will be pain transitioning to a Medicare for All system. Millions of medical coders, insurance adjusters, actuaries and salespersons would be displaced from their jobs. Countless medical marketers and their enormous downstream support industry would also be displaced. Since we all currently pay for health care one way or another, all of these jobs are on our collective payroll, without material benefit. To quote our president, let me be the first to say: \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d\n\nTony Asch\n\nWarren, N.J.\n\nWhile I wholeheartedly agree with Dr. Atlas\u2019s conclusions, he and most other commentators misdiagnose the problem when they blame \u201csingle-payer systems.\u201d Medicare has a single-payer\u2014the government\u2014but uses multiple providers who compete on the basis of service and surgical outcomes, though not on price. Single-payer can also describe the GI Bill, which lets veterans choose any college and doesn\u2019t lock them into attending a government-run school.\n\nBritain\u2019s National Health Service and our VA hospitals should be called \u201csingle-provider systems,\u201d since the patient has very limited choices for treatment. The doctors in the single-provider systems are on salary, have no incentive to work longer hours and don\u2019t have to worry about online reviews because their customers have very limited choices. The problem is not so much with single-payers but with single-providers and lack of consumer choice.\n\nDennis Fulmer\n\nCanton, Ohio\n\nThe Brits spend about $4,200 per person to cover everyone adequately. Nobody in Britain worries about becoming impoverished if they become ill. The U.S. spends $3.7 trillion per year, or about $11,400 per person, to cover a few very well, some adequately and many very poorly. For all our spending, the Brits have the higher life expectancy.\n\nBurr and Jane Lechevet\n\nTampa, Fla.\n\nThe average wait time to see a specialist in the Boston area is 52 days, mostly because of insurance requirements that create a series of steps that a patient must take in perfect sequence or be denied full coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to fix the problem. Restrict all government health-care dollars to direct patient care only\u2014no more incentives, no more meaningless measures. Isolate the budget from other competing needs like housing or defense. And let everyone have the choice to buy Medicare or contribute to their health-savings account.\n\nIt seems like we already have the worst of both worlds. Why pay even more to keep waiting?\n\nPaula Muto, M.D., FACS\n\nLawrence, Mass.\n\nIn Switzerland, arguably one of the best run countries in the world, all medical care is private. Each Swiss citizen is required to get his or her own private, individual health-insurance plan at age 18.\n\nWith Medicare for All, U.S. physicians, who are increasingly employees, would be constrained by compliance and best-practice issues set forth by the medical bureaucracy.

Photo: anatoly maltsev/epa-efe/rex/Shutterstock\n\nSo far so good with the ongoing U.S. experiment in expanded economic liberty. Americans are confident about their financial prospects and enjoying a strong jobs market. And it shows. The Journal\u2019s Harriet Torry reports today:\n\nThe Journal\u2019s Justin Lahart adds that \u201cwhile there were some special factors that helped boost the overall number\u2014higher gasoline prices increased service-station sales and hurricane-related sales helped hardware stores\u2014business was generally good all over. Clothing stores and sporting goods stores both registered sales growth of 0.5% on the month, for example, and department store sales were up 1.3%.\u201d\n\nDespite a weakening global economy and concerns about how President Trump\u2019s trade stare-down with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping is going to end, the U.S. economy appears to be logging another solid quarter.\n\nYet polls find that young adults in the U.S., perhaps scarred by a decade of financial crisis and then sluggish growth, are disturbingly open to socialist central planning of the economy. Vermont\u2019s socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders is the most influential policy maker in the Democratic party, though he\u2019s still not a member. Now, having succeeded in centrally planning Amazon\u2019s warehouse wages, Mr. Sanders wants to do the same to Walmart . Yet history counsels deep skepticism regarding claims that such government coercion will lead to higher living standards.\n\nModern readers may naturally think of contemporary economists like Paul Krugman when they think of botched economic forecasts. But Mr. Krugman\u2019s errors look rather small compared to those made by the inventor of socialism. Columbia University b-school professor Charles Calomiris writes:\n\nIt is worth remembering that Karl Marx regarded socialism as an economic necessity that would emerge out of the ashes of capitalism precisely because capitalism would fail to sustain wealth creation. Marx made many specific, and erroneous, predictions about capitalism, including its declining profitability and rising unemployment. His analysis did not consider permanent economic growth in a capitalist system to be a possibility. And his \u201chistorical materialist\u201d view of political choice claimed the rich and powerful would never share power voluntarily with their economic lessers, or create social safety nets. Writing in the mid-19th century, Marx fundamentally failed to understand the huge changes in technology, political suffrage, or social safety net policies that were occurring around him.\n\nOnly 135 years after the death of Marx, profits are surging in the world\u2019s largest economy. Lindsey Bell of CFRA Research notes that third-quarter earnings growth of 28.3% for S+P 500 companies is among the best in decades. Ms. Bell adds that \u201cthe overall sales growth rate of 9.3% for the S&P 500 in the quarter was impressive as top-line momentum continued for the fourth quarter in a row. In the second quarter, sales were 10.3% higher year-over-year, up from about 9% in the prior two quarters and significantly higher than the average growth rate of 4.0% since the emergence from the Great Recession.\u201d\n\nMarx doesn\u2019t just own the biggest blown earnings call in the history of markets. Prof. Calomiris notes that many of Marx\u2019s other predictions also turned out be catastrophically off target:\n\nNot only has socialist theory been wrong about the economic and political fruits of capitalism, it failed to see the problems that arise in socialist governments. Socialism\u2019s record has been pain, not gain, especially for the poor. Socialism produced mass starvation in eastern Europe and China, as it undermined the ability of farmers to grow and market their crops. In less extreme incarnations, such as the UK in the decades after World War II and before Margaret Thatcher, it stunted growth. In most cases, socialism\u2019s monopoly on economic control also fomented corruption by government officials, as was especially apparent in Latin American and African socialist regimes. The adverse economic consequences of socialism led the Scandinavian countries to dial back their versions of socialism in the past decades.\n\nThe good news is that despite the resurgence of Marxist chic among young people in the U.S., people seeking the wealth that American youngsters can take for granted already know that Marxism doesn\u2019t work. Mr. Calomiris adds:\n\nSocialism has been abandoned in virtually all of the developing world. Countries today do not seek to emulate the disasters of North Korea, Cuba, or Venezuela. They also avoid high taxation of the rich. That reflects the recognition that countries compete with each other for capital. Expropriating the rich tends to make them leave, and when they leave they take their wealth with them.\n\nThis philosophical shift in the developing world is a major change since the 1980s when socialism was still fashionable among some. The shift away from socialist thinking was grounded in the growing body of empirical evidence about the kinds of policies that produced growth and poverty alleviation\u2014that is, policies that used markets as a lever of economic development. Now developing countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, India, China, South Africa, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia are known as \u201cemerging economies,\u201d a description that recognizes their need to emerge from state control of their economies through privatization, free trade, and the creation of viable private financial intermediaries to promote growth and poverty alleviation. All around the developing world, socialism is understood as a false promise, an ideological opium that repressive elites use to retain and expand power. Capitalism, in contrast, is seen as the force that has lifted over a billion people out of poverty worldwide since 1990.\n\nIndeed it has. And as for the alternative, this column will go out on a limb and predict that Marx will continue to be wrong for the next 135 years.\n\n***\n\nIn Other News\n\nBut He\u2019s Got Great Instincts\n\n\u201cJapan cybersecurity and Olympics minister: \u2018I\u2019ve never used a computer\u2019,\u201d Reuters, November 14\n\nAnd He May Be the Happiest Person in Japan\n\n\u201cA new study finds that cutting your time on social media to 30 minutes a day reduces your risk of depression and loneliness,\u201d Business Insider, Nov. 12\n\nBetter Call Yoshitaka\n\n\u201cCybersecurity \u2018moonshot\u2019 panel sends recommendations to White House,\u201d The Hill, Nov. 15\n\nStill Another Cyber Threat\n\n\u201cWhy Amazon tech bros will ruin the NYC dating scene,\u201d New York Post, Nov. 15\n\nGood Thing Foreign Cyber Threats Are Receding\n\n\u201cMacron to Trump: \u2018I do not do policy or diplomacy by tweets\u2019,\u201d Politico, Nov. 15\n\nWhy Not Give All the Other Genders a Chance?\n\n\u201cInsurgents seek female challenger to replace Pelosi,\u201d The Hill, Nov. 15\n\nPeace Agreement Definitely Right Around the Corner\n\n\u201cPalestinian police chief suspended for helping Israelis fix flat tire,\u201d Associated Press, Nov. 15\n\nAlternative Headline: Trump Names Entrepreneur Fluent in Afrikaans and Xhosa as South Africa Ambassador\n\n\u201cTrump Names Handbag Designer and Mar-a-Lago Club Member as South Africa Ambassador,\u201d Newsweek, Nov. 15\n\n***\n\nFollow James Freeman on Twitter.\n\nSubscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.\n\nTo suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.\n\n(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.

Filled with locals and die-hard skiers, these small towns exude a low-key coolness you just won\u2019t find around the fire pits at the luxury resorts. Here, four under-the-radar destinations for ski season.\n\nAbout 40 miles north of Salt Lake City International Airport, Ogden makes a swell base for skiing at both swank Snowbasin and scruffy Powder Mountain. A former rail hub that hit a rough patch, it\u2019s rebounded in recent years by banking on an active nightlife that upends Utah\u2019s staid reputation. Most of the action centers around Historic 25th Street, lined with several bars and restaurants. One culinary standout is Hearth on 25th, where that titular hearth turns out yak meatballs and oven-roasted rabbit (195 25th St., hearth25.com). For accommodations, the Bigelow Hotel (built in 1891) clings proudly to its 1920s heyday; the d\u00e9cor is all art-deco chandeliers and ornate ceilings reliefs (from $120 a night, bigelowhotelogden.com). Come weekend mornings, you\u2019ll find some of the biggest crowds in Ogden milling around Grounds for Coffee, a good place to quiz locals about their favorite double-diamond runs (111 25th St., groundsforcoffee.com). Want a break from the slopes? Check out the indoor Salomon Center, home to a wave pool, a rock-climbing wall and the \u201ciFly\u201d skydiving experience (2261 Kiesel Ave.).\n\nFrisco, Colo.\n\nSeveral top Colorado resorts, including Vail and Breckenridge, are within a 30-minute drive from Frisco, sitting pretty at 9,000 feet next to the Dillon Reservoir. And it takes just 10 minutes to reach underrated Copper Mountain. Right within city limits is the Frisco Adventure Park, where you can go tubing, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. A former beneficiary of the local silver-mining boom, Frisco retains some of that frontier-town appeal, starting with a cinematic Main Street lined with mom-and-pop businesses, including the 40-year-old Butterhorn Bakery and Caf\u00e9, which serves a killer breakfast (408 Main St., butterhornbakery.com). But Frisco has its share of lively new spots, too, such as the HighSide Brewing craft-beer bar (720 Main St., highsidebrewing.com). Built in 1885 as a stagecoach stop, the Frisco Lodge Bed and Breakfast is smack in the middle of downtown (from $194 a night, friscolodge.com).\n\n20 MINUTES AWAY Wyoming\u2019s Grand Targhee Resort, a quick drive from the small town of Driggs, Idaho. Photo: Grand Targhee Resort\n\nDriggs, Idaho\n\nTucked in the Teton Valley, Driggs sits near two great Wyoming ski areas: Grand Targhee is a 20-minute drive away while Jackson Hole is an hour. With fewer than 2,000 inhabitants, Driggs lacks the hotel bounty found in larger cities, but both Airbnb and VRBO list an ample supply of affordable lodging options. Bonus: You can stock up for groceries at Driggs\u2019s excellent supermarket, Broulim\u2019s. Alternatively, Warbirds Caf\u00e9, nestled inside the tiny Driggs airport, prepares some of the tastiest food in town, skewed toward local products\u2014think grilled bison chile tamale or seared steelhead trout (675 Airport Rd., warbirdscafe.com). For apr\u00e8s-ski cocktails back at your rental\u2014or for a curious Idaho souvenir\u2014stop in at the Grand Teton Distillery to pick up a bottle of huckleberry-flavored vodka (1755 N. Highway 33, tetondistillery.com).\n\nTruckee, Calif.\n\nA few miles inland from the north shore of Lake Tahoe, Truckee is about a 15-minute drive from the major Sierra Nevada areas such as Squaw Valley/Alpine Meadows and Northstar, and about 30 minutes from Homewood Mountain Resort. Unsurprisingly, thanks to its location, this old logging town has morphed into a sporty tourist center over the years. These days it\u2019s better equipped to wine and dine those tourists. The farm-to-table ethos rules at Truckee Philosophy, specializing in sous-vide meats and colorful salads (10412 Donner Pass Rd., truckeephilosophy.com), while beer aficionados can bar crawl between Truckee Brewing Company, FiftyFifty Brewing and Alibi Ale Works. Last year, the latter opened a second location, dubbed the Truckee Public House (10069 Bridge St., alibialeworks.com), that offers live music and chimichurri beef nachos. As for accommodations, the Cedar House Sport Hotel is a decidedly modern take on the rustic mountain lodge (from $180 a night, cedarhousesporthotel.com).\n\nCorrections & Amplifications You can\u2019t go dog-sledding in the Frisco Adventure Park in Frisco, Colo.

In \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d an episode in the sitcom\u2019s fifth season, Jason Alexander\u2019s curmudgeonly character waddles into Jerry\u2019s apartment in a poofy black Gore-Tex jacket.

This winter, two decades after that episode aired, high-fashion brands like Jil Sander, Givenchy, Rick Owens and Burberry are overstuffing their own outerwear\u2014with a difference. The shells are matte, not glossy; the shapes are longer, even debonair. These suddenly stylish inflated coats aren\u2019t just being created by labels with inflated price tags: Affordable brands such as Uniqlo and Zara are flinging out their own fluffy puffers. Then there are the stalwarts: Outdoor labels like Patagonia and Marmot have long marketed practical marshmallowy parkas, and this year the North Face re-released its poofy Nuptse puffer from 1996, which, like many bubble coats, was popular among rappers and their fans in the waning 20th century.\n\n\u201cIn the early \u201990s I lived in Wisconsin and it was cold, and all of the hip hop kids, all the streetwear kids, wore really big puffy jackets,\u201d said Jeremy Smith, 41, the owner of Standard and Strange, a denim store in Oakland, Calif. Along with chunky sneakers, rugby shirts and bucket hats, the renaissance of chubby parkas aligns with a larger \u201990s fashion revival. That may shed light on why jackets are expanding, but the larger question remains: Does any man actually require a coat that huge?\n\nSERIOUSLY? A new ultra-bloated look by 5 Moncler Craig Green.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily need a giant puffy jacket unless you\u2019re somewhere really, really cold [like] Manitoba or Saskatchewan in the middle of winter at -40 degrees Celsius,\u201d said Renata C. Mannino, the product line manager at Arc\u2019teryx, a Vancouver, Canada outerwear company. Since the amount of insulation does roughly relate to how warm a jacket is, in most cases an extravagantly inflated puffer constitutes overkill.\n\nIn Burlington, Vt., where 28-year-old digital strategist Tyler Sandoval lives, many locals own \u201ccomically large\u201d the North Face puffers for skiing and backcountry hiking. Yet they pose problems off the mountain, he said: Bigger is not necessarily always better, especially when most spaces are vigorously heated throughout winter. \u201cWalking around it\u2019ll be cold in the winter,\u201d said Mr. Sandoval, \u201cbut then you go into every store and it\u2019s warm as hell.\u201d And in a restaurant or movie theater, a gigundo down jacket takes up so much space you might as well pay for an extra seat. Mr. Sandoval finds his slender Patagonia down jacket plenty warm on most days, though he did qualify that its thinner shell is more susceptible to snags (\u201cmine\u2019s covered in duct tape\u201d) and so he primarily wears it underneath a Barbour jacket, which works as a scratch-proof cover.\n\nPuffiness also hinders mobility and scope for styling. \u201cWhen you have a very bulky jacket it\u2019s definitely warm, but you can\u2019t do a lot of things in it\u2014you definitely can\u2019t layer it,\u201d said Kim Smith, head of product at Everlane, which just launched its first recycled synthetic-down jacket, made with Primaloft. Unlike down, this environmentally friendly fill is not plucked from animals and reuses existing materials. Everlane\u2019s puffer, added Ms. Smith, is \u201clightweight so you can go for a run in it, do a long walk in it,\u201d tasks that George Costanza\u2019s restrictive Gore-Tex juggernaut would render mighty challenging.\n\nGAINING WEIGHT / The Season\u2019s Puffer Coats, Ranked From Thin to Kingpin\n\n1.

There\u2019s never a tough day at work after a paddle home.\u201d\n\nHard-charging, driven types have found myriad new ways to wedge fitness into a day at the office. Whether it\u2019s attending shorter versions of cult boutique classes, lifting heavier weights less frequently or streaming fitness apps, disciplined exercisers are getting creative about their workouts. How to take a page from their reps logs:\n\nBe efficient \u201cSpending an hour in the gym is old-school thinking,\u201d said Amy Shapiro, a registered dietitian and founder of nutritional counseling service Real Nutrition NYC. \u201cFor my clients who work a lot, I recommend shorter, more intense workouts of 20 or 30 minutes.\u201d Fitness purveyors are increasingly creating quickie versions of signature classes. SLT\u2019s 30-minute \u201cExpress\u201d individual session, offered at its SLT/X location in Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron district, shaves 20 minutes off what its website calls its \u201cslow-paced, fat burning\u201d original. Type-A Angelenos flock to a 25-minute class at Lagree Fitness Studios\u2019s Westwood and West Hollywood locations that equips each user with a patented Space Age-ish contraption called the Supra, which both inclines and tilts.\n\nBe more stringent With the goal of doing more in less time, many quickie workouts incorporate heavy weights. Publicist Dianne Vavra, 51, swears by once-a-week sessions at InForm, a Manhattan-based pioneer of the 20-minute workout. Ms. Vavra, who lifts the heaviest weight she can handle, said, \u201cThey work you to failure. This is the only time when failure is good.\u201d Another New York studio, Shock Therapy Fitness, deploys Electro Muscle Stimulation, the exercise technology used by in-flight astronauts, for its high-intensity, 30-minute classes.\n\nBe digital With the explosion of streaming fitness services, excuses not to exercise are so mid-aughts. Ms. Shapiro, the dietitian, enthused about Aaptiv, an audio fitness app that offers workouts as short as five minutes. Trainiac ($50 a month, trainiacfit.com) is a new app that pairs members virtually with a personal trainer, who works around your schedule. Still not app-y? Just flick on your TV. With the growing roster of speedy fitness classes served up on Amazon Prime, including the popular BeFIT Transform, that \u201cHomecoming\u201d binge may just have to wait."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Harriet Torry", "title": "Economists Split on Whether Midterms Outcome Will Increase or Decrease Uncertainty", "description": "Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were roughly split on whether the outcome of the recent midterm elections would dispel or increase uncertainty for the economy and financial markets in the coming months.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-split-on-whether-outcome-of-midterms-will-increase-or-decrease-uncertainty-1542294000", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-27675/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:24:09Z", "content": "Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were roughly split on whether the outcome of the recent midterm elections would dispel or increase uncertainty for the economy and financial markets in the coming months.

And in these states, the researchers\u2014Michele Baggio and David Simon of the University of Connecticut and Alberto Chong of Georgia State University\u2014found an uptick in marijuana use.\n\nAnd when more people smoke marijuana, they get friskier and, apparently, more careless. After legalization, there\u2019s \u201cincreased frequency of sexual intercourse, decreased purchase of condoms and suggestive evidence on decreased condom use during sex,\u201d the authors wrote in the paper.\n\n\u201cIn the specific case of marijuana, it is typically believed that its consumption heightens sensory perception, increases relaxation, reduces stress and diminishes anxiety,\u201d the paper says. \u201cA feeling of relaxation may change attitudes toward taking sexual risks by becoming less concerned about the consequences of sexual intercourse, including reducing protection or taking on more sexual partners.\u201d\n\nThe result is a baby boomlet.\n\n\u201cWe find that the enactment of any medical marijuana laws increases the birth rate by 0.40 or approximately 4 births per quarter for every 10,000 women of childbearing age,\u201d the paper said. \u201cThese results provide evidence that marijuana use has a considerable, unintended, and positive effect on fertility.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. general fertility rate in 2017 was 60.3 births per 1,000 women aged 15 years to 44 years, down from 62.0% in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe authors looked at data from 2004 through 2014. They drilled down to county-level condom sales, although the paper does not consider how other forms of birth control might have influenced their findings.\n\nKasey Buckles, a University of Notre Dame economics professor who studies demographics and family issues, said the paper does indeed suggest \u201ca large effect\u201d on births tied to medical marijuana laws. The paper indicates that \u201cif we went from marijuana being illegal everywhere in the U.S. to being legal everywhere, you would get about 120,000 more births per year, as there are roughly 4 million births each year in the U.S.,\u201d Ms. Buckles said.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Chong noted that any uptick in births comes in a climate where overall U.S. fertility rates have been under pressure. The general U.S. fertility rate has declined every year but one since 2007.\n\nBut he and his coauthors don\u2019t believe that full legalization of marijuana will much affect the overall trend of this key demographic measure.\n\nOthers agree. Brad Wilcox of the National Marriage Project, a nonpartisan effort at the University of Virginia, said the research finds \u201ca modest effect at the margin.\u201d But he added, \u201cI don\u2019t see the legalization of marijuana as a silver bullet in pushing fertility rates up.\u201d\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nA previous version of this post misspelled Kasey Buckles's first name.

But as American production scales up, those frackers are losing ground to Big Oil.\n\nGiant companies such as Chevron Corp. CVX -3.38% and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM -2.67% are increasing shale production faster and with fewer complications than their smaller rivals. Their superior size and deeper pockets give them an edge in planning large drilling projects and locking in the pipeline and labor deals needed to ensure profitability.\n\nExxon doubled its shale rigs across the U.S. from the end of last year through September and became the most active driller in the country, according to industry tracker RigData. Chevron\u2019s output in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico rose 80% for the year ended in September, eclipsing some of the small producers that spent years building up their fracking positions.\n\n\u201cYou need scale once you\u2019re in development mode to be able to succeed at the margins that you have,\u201d said Jeff Shellebarger, Chevron\u2019s president of North America exploration and production.\n\nSize also helps larger companies weather volatility in the oil markets, where U.S. crude prices have plunged more than 20% in the past month to about $56 a barrel. The bigger companies kept spending in check as oil rallied earlier in the year, making them less vulnerable to the recent selloff. As a result, Exxon shares have fallen only 4% in the past 30 days, compared with the 17% decline in the index of smaller producers, according to FactSet.\n\nSmaller exploration and production companies recently reported their best third-quarter performance in five years, thanks to higher oil prices earlier in the year. Of 27 independent producers, 23 were profitable, including EOG Resources Inc. and Continental Resources Inc. The companies\u2019 collective net income totaled about $6 billion, compared with $2 billion in losses a year ago.\n\nBigger producers also reported strong quarters. Global oil companies including Exxon, Chevron, BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Occidental Petroleum Corp. and ConocoPhillips made almost $5 billion in the quarter from their North American drilling units, up from a $373 million loss. While those results include areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, most companies said shale production was a significant factor.\n\nThe bigger companies have benefited in shale drilling from being able to ramp up production with fewer obstacles from Texas to North Dakota. Smaller operators, meanwhile, faced challenges such as pipeline bottlenecks that forced some to scale back drilling plans or move rigs away from areas where the constraints were most severe.\n\n\u201cScale is so important in shale,\u201d said Uday Turaga, chief executive of ADI Analytics, an energy consulting firm. \u201cYou can drive down costs from suppliers, secure pipeline access more quickly and get better contracts.\u201d\n\nIndependent exploration and production companies also hedged much of their oil production to protect themselves from the downside risk of falling oil prices. That was crucial protection for many smaller, less well-financed shale companies, but it prevented them from fully capitalizing on the upswing in oil prices.\n\nAbout three-fourths of the smaller companies have spent more cash than they have generated from drilling so far in 2018, a metric many investors track to monitor the financial sustainability of the industry. Collectively, they have outspent their cash intake by about $5 billion, according to FactSet data.\n\nWhile many big oil companies were slow to fracking, bigger companies have tended to benefit as technology matures and drillers shift from exploration to large-scale production.\n\nThat trend is most apparent in the Permian Basin. Large companies including Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and Occidental this year are set to produce an average of about 600,000 barrels a day of crude in the region, up 54% from last year. By 2021, their output there will exceed 1.1 million barrels a day, or about 20% of the area\u2019s total shale-related output, according to consulting firm Rystad Energy.\n\n\u201c \u2018Scale is so important in shale. You can drive down costs from suppliers, secure pipeline access more quickly and get better contracts.\u2019 \u201d \u2014Uday Turaga, CEO of ADI Analytics\n\nChevron\u2019s Permian Basin production soared to more than 330,000 barrels of oil and gas a day during the third quarter, an 80% increase from a year earlier. By comparison, it took Parsley Energy Inc., a smaller operator, four years to boost its production to 100,000 barrels from 10,000 barrels.\n\nLarger, integrated companies have managed to avoid many challenges that have plagued independent producers, whose U.S. production increased by an average of 17% in the past year, according to a review of company disclosures.\n\nHedging is projected to cost top drillers more than $5 billion this year, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis of the larger companies that hedge their oil and gas production.\n\nThe recent drop in oil prices is likely to mitigate hedging losses. However, on average, the companies\u2019 hedging programs don\u2019t begin to generate gains unless crude prices fall below $56 a barrel, Wood Mackenzie analyst Andrew McConn said.\n\nOil giants generally avoid those kinds of futures contracts. Because their market size dwarfs small drillers, they face limited pressure from lenders to hedge, and their hedging losses have been muted.\n\nPipeline access is another area where bigger companies fared better. As U.S. oil production soared above 11 million barrels a day, growth exceeded existing pipelines, forcing smaller companies to sell their oil at a discount. Crude sold in the Permian Basin was discounted by an average of $14 a barrel during the third quarter, according to S&P Global Platts. That differential has since contracted to about $5.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nLarger oil companies have historically secured enough pipeline capacity from any oil field in which they are boosting production to avoid having to sell crude at such discounts. Many own or build pipelines outright.\n\nThat helped Occidental, one of the largest Permian Basin producers, realize nearly $800 million in profit from its pipeline and trading business during the third quarter, more than three times the income from its U.S. drilling business. Vicki Hollub, the company\u2019s chief executive, said the company\u2019s integrated business model proved advantageous.\n\nWrite to Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com and Rebecca Elliott at rebecca.elliott@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": null, "title": "In the Elevator With Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi", "description": "WSJ's Joanna Stern \"bumps into\" Uber's CEO in the WSJ elevator and gets the scoop on Uber's drone program, flying cars and its workplace culture.

We're also monitoring signs of a global slowdown, the cost of \"free\" social media, and the fate of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government after two senior members quit over Brexit. Let us know what you think by replying to this email.\n\nTO HAVE AND HAVE NOT\n\nAmazon.com and Google's decisions to add tens of thousands of jobs to New York and the Washington area reflect a growing divide in the U.S. A few big cities, particularly on the coasts, are soaking up high-tech talent and are also becoming wealthier, more liberal and more ethnically diverse\u2014shifting the economic, political and cultural landscape of the nation, Shayndi Raice and Janet Adamy write.\n\nSmaller cities are also pulling in educated workers, but are having trouble competing for the nation\u2019s most prized jobs and biggest projects, while rural areas are falling behind.\n\nBRIGHT LIGHTS, BIGGER CITY\n\nAs global competition dried up manufacturing jobs in small towns, the U.S. became more dependent on the growth of knowledge and service jobs that tend to proliferate in dense places. Five cities\u2014New York, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco\u2014accounted for a third of all Fortune 500 headquarters and half of Fortune 500 firms\u2019 profits last year, according to the University of Toronto's Richard Florida. The Washington area, which had just four corporate headquarters in 1975, was home to 17 last year. New York had 70, more than any other U.S. city.\n\nIn the past 10 years, employment in U.S. cities has grown 7% and the number of businesses has grown 11%, while employment has contracted in nonmetro areas and the number of businesses there has barely changed.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH TODAY\n\nU.S. retail sales for October, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, are expected to rise 0.5% from the prior month.\n\nU.S. import prices for October, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, are expected to rise 0.2% from the prior month.\n\nU.S. jobless claims, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, are expected to remain low.\n\nThe New York Fed Empire State manufacturing survey for November, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to fall to 20 from 21.1 a month earlier.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey for November, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to fall to 20 from 22.2.\n\nIt's another day chock full of Fed talk. Fed vice chairman for supervision Randal Quarles testifies before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET, Chairman Jerome Powell reviews post-Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts in Houston at 11:30 a.m. ET, Atlanta's Raphael Bostic speaks at a banking conference in Madrid at 1 p.m. ET, and the Minneapolis' Neel Kashkari participates in a Q&A with the Minnesota AgriGrowth Council at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nRED FLAGS\n\nThe Federal Reserve is keeping a close eye on the global economy. \u201cYou still see solid growth, but you see growing signs of a bit of a slowdown. And it is concerning,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday.\n\nThe global growth outlook was one of a number of challenges Mr. Powell flagged. He didn\u2019t say that any of them were strong or surprising enough right now to change the Fed\u2019s current policy path of gradually lifting rates, and he said he remains optimistic about the U.S. economy, Nick Timiraos reports. \u201cI\u2019m very happy about the state of the economy now,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cOur policy is part of the reason why our economy is in such a good place right now.\u201d\n\nSO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?\n\nThe global economy has hit a soft patch, putting the U.S.\u2019s robust growth at risk should it persist. Economic output in Japan and Germany contracted in the third quarter, while in October consumer spending in China hit its slowest pace in five months and bank lending fell, William Boston, Josh Zumbrun and Nina Adam report.\n\nOne-time events played a role in some of these bumps. But across the globe, economists and business executives warned about a common denominator that is hurting growth: trade battles among the U.S., China and others. Tariffs are hitting some businesses, and worries about the impact of worsening trade discord are also weighing on sentiment.\n\nTARIFFS ON MY MIND\n\nInternational companies in the U.S. say potential tariffs on automobile and auto-parts imports would be the most damaging of the Trump administration\u2019s trade actions, surpassing the tariffs that have been imposed between the U.S. and China, and the global tariffs on steel and aluminum, Josh Zumbrun reports.\n\nCompanies, even outside the automobile industry, are closely watching as the administration debates whether to impose the auto tariffs, a new survey from the Organization for International Investment shows. Asked to rate the impact on U.S. competitiveness of various policies, CFOs said the auto tariffs\u2014if implemented\u2014would nearly cancel out all the positive impact of the administration\u2019s 2017 tax overhaul.\n\nTHERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH\n\nGoogle and Facebook make their money by giving away their products and then selling ads. Unfortunately, the zero-price business model is a source of many of the problems plaguing the Internet. It\u2019s no coincidence that Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc.\u2014which garner more than 80% of their revenue from advertising\u2014are the ones most often accused of propagating toxic content and eroding privacy, while Microsoft Corp. and Apple, whose revenue comes from selling software, hardware and services, fly under the radar, Greg Ip writes.\n\nThink about why price matters: It\u2019s how the market rations precious resources. When it comes to generating volume, free is a dream; when it comes to quality control, it\u2019s a nightmare. To generate ads, search and social media platforms must maximize users and engagement. To target those ads, they must learn as much about their users as possible. This pits volume and revenue against quality and privacy.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nUltimately, you deserve a Brexit Secretary who can make the case for the deal you are pursuing with conviction. I am only sorry, in good conscience, that I cannot.\u2014Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, in his resignation letter to Prime Minister Theresa May\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY\n\nWHAT ELSE WE'RE READING\n\n\u201cDoes a big bazooka matter?\u201d The European Central Bank asks the question in a new research paper. The conclusion, when it comes to exchange rates, is yes. The authors found that the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing program\u2014which led to a big rise in the ECB\u2019s balance sheet\u2014weakened the euro-dollar rate by 12%. The takeaway: \u201cWe find that QE measures have large and persistent effects on the exchange rate, and that they materialize through a change in interest rate differentials, partly reflecting expectations of the future monetary policy stance.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic Church\u2019s Jesuit order founded religious missions in modern-day Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay in 1609. Until they were booted out in 1767, they instructed the indigenous Guarani in reading, writing, and various crafts. \"I show that in areas of former Jesuit presence\u2014within the Guarani area\u2014educational attainment was higher and remains so (by 10%-15%) 250 years later. These educational differences have also translated into incomes that are 10% higher today,\" Felipe Valencia Caicedo writes in The Quarterly Journal of Economics. \"The enduring effects observed are consistent with transmission mechanisms of structural transformation, occupational specialization, and technology adoption in agriculture.\"\n\nUP NEXT: FRIDAY\n\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi speaks in Frankfurt at 3:30 a.m. ET.\n\nEurozone consumer prices for October are out at 5 a.m. ET.\n\nU.S. industrial production for October, out at 9:15 a.m. ET, is expected to rise 0.2% from a month earlier.\n\nThe Kansas City Fed's manufacturing survey for November is out at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nThe Chicago Fed's Charles Evans speaks on the economy and monetary policy at 11:30 a.m. ET."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Laurence Norman", "title": "European Officials to Meet to Approve Draft Brexit Deal - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal European Officials to Meet to Approve Draft Brexit Deal Wall Street Journal BRUSSELS\u2014European leaders are set to meet in Brussels on Nov. 25, with European Council President Donald Tusk calling on them to sign off an exit agreement with Br\u2026", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/european-officials-to-meet-to-approve-draft-brexit-deal-1542269504", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37189/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:18:54Z", "content": "U.K. Prime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit secretary has resigned, signaling turmoil within her government over her plan for the country to exit from the European Union.

CPB 2.56% could use a little outside help.\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services Inc. recommended that the food maker\u2019s shareholders vote for all five of activist hedge fund Third Point LLC\u2019s director nominees, according to a report released to ISS clients Wednesday and viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nProxy advisers\u2019 recommendations can influence which way some institutional shareholders vote. ISS\u2019s nod toward Third Point will likely sway some votes in the hedge fund\u2019s direction or give it additional leverage in settlement discussions as it faces an uphill fight to gain influence over the company.\n\nISS said that even when accounting for headwinds in the packaged-food industry, Campbell has substantially trailed its peers, making board-level change warranted.\n\nDaniel Loeb\u2019s Third Point is waging a high-profile proxy fight at Campbell, where it says the current board has done little to lift a slumping stock price and falling soup sales. It is working with George Strawbridge Jr., a descendant of the company\u2019s founder. Together, they own a roughly 10% stake.\n\nBut they are up against at least four other descendants\u2014including three current board members\u2014who together control roughly 41% of Campbell shares and plan to vote in favor of the company. Campbell has said it was already undertaking many of the actions Third Point has suggested before it revealed its stake.\n\nISS is recommending Third Point\u2019s entire slate, which includes Third Point partner Munib Islam, former Blue Buffalo CEO Kurt Schmidt, comScore Inc. President Sarah Hofstetter, former Uber Technologies Inc. executive Bozoma Saint John and former Hostess Brands Inc. CEO William Toler.\n\nGlass Lewis, the other primary proxy adviser, recommended soon after that shareholders support three of five Third Point nominees, but not Mr. Islam or Ms. Saint John. It argued Campbell could benefit from Ms. Hofstetter\u2019s branding experience and the operational experience of Mr. Toler and Mr. Schmidt.\n\nCampbell said it disagrees with ISS\u2019s conclusion. It reiterated last week that Third Point rejected a settlement offer for Ms. Hofstetter and Mr. Schmidt to join its board, which would have expanded its size to 14. It also repeated that it wouldn\u2019t consider adding a Third Point employee to its board, because it believes it could limit the ability to maintain board confidentiality.\n\nThird Point last week backed off a bid to replace Campbell\u2019s entire 12-person board and cut its slate to five nominees. Such a maneuver could increase the chance of gaining proxy adviser support and, in turn, potentially prompt the two sides to reach a settlement.\n\nThe shareholder vote is scheduled for Nov. 29.\n\nISS centers its recommendations around whether the activists have made a compelling case that change is warranted and, if so, which nominees are more likely to succeed at effectuating the change.\n\nThird Point\u2019s most recent proxy fight was in 2014, when it launched a contest for three seats on Sotheby\u2019s board. In that case, ISS recommended supporting two of Third Point\u2019s three nominees, including Mr. Loeb. The two sides settled the day before the vote, expanding the auction house\u2019s board to add all three of Third Point\u2019s nominees.\n\nWrite to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Mike Bird", "title": "Tencent Stock Rallies on Strong Earnings", "description": "Tencent stock rose 4.2% after it reported a 30% rise in profits, more than analysts expected.

Once a symbol of high cost and dysfunction, Denver soared in rankings of reliability, value and convenience.\n\nThe rankings scored the 20 largest U.S. air depots in 15 categories, from on-time reliability to longest walk. The rankings are designed to reflect what matters most to travelers, including categories like security-line wait times, Wi-Fi speed, average Yelp scores for restaurants, average fares, Uber cost to the local convention center, rental-car taxes and fees, number of nonstop destinations and market dominance of the largest airline.\n\nInside the Airport Rankings The Journal has ranked the 20 largest U.S. airports after weighing 14 key factors plus a survey of over 4,800 readers. Below are the overall rankings, as well as their rankings in groups of measurements labeled most reliable, best value and most comfortable. Click on the airport name to see more details. (1) The average of an airport's reliability, value and convenience scores. (2) Includes on-time arrival percentage, flight cancellation percentage, average arrival delays, average time between gate departure and takeoff and TSA screening times. (3) Includes domestic fares, market share of airport's largest airline, cheapest on-site parking rate, car-rental taxes and UberX fare to convention center. (4) Includes Wi-Fi speeds, Yelp restaurant ratings, maximum walking distances, non-stop destinations and a WSJ reader satisfaction score.\n\nThe rankings also relied on an extensive survey of WSJ readers whose input on overall experience, ease of use, security, restaurants, shopping, airline clubs, bathroom cleanliness, electric charging outlets and other categories was graded and scored.\n\n[Need a winter coat?

Register here.\n\n\u201cMost or even all U.S. airports have made huge strides over the past decade,\u201d noted reader Bob MacLeod of Orlando, Fla. \u201cI love flying through an airport I have not been to in a while just to see what\u2019s new.\u201d\n\nIn the total rankings of all 15 measures, Denver edged Orlando and Phoenix for the top spot with high scores in reliability value and convenience categories. Denver was the only airport to place in the top four in each of those three broad categories.\n\nOrlando, which ranked second among the 20 airports overall, scored high in convenience\u2014walking distance is low, for example. Phoenix, third-best overall, benefited from a low percentage of canceled flights, short average delay and taxi time for departing aircraft and cheap on-site parking rates.\n\nTwo giant hub airports\u2014Atlanta, the world\u2019s busiest, and Dallas-Fort Worth\u2014scored very well in the 15-category WSJ rankings. Big congestion often means big inconvenience and higher cost at airports, but ATL and DFW overcame their size disadvantage. At the bottom of the comprehensive rankings? No surprises: the three New York-area airports, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark. Among the woes: delays, cancellations, high fares and lousy food.\n\nDenver International Airport is located a ways from downtown, but the rail system has helped make the trip into the middle of town easier. Photo: Gary A. Conner/Getty Images\n\nThe top three airports\u2014Denver, Orlando and Phoenix\u2014have one major factor in common: strong competition among airlines. Denver is one of the few airports with three major airlines connecting customers: United, Southwest and Frontier. In Phoenix, American and Southwest compete with connecting hubs. In Orlando, the largest airline, Delta, controls only 28% of passenger traffic.\n\nAll three airlines big in Denver compete head-to-head on some routes, and so far, it\u2019s working. \u201cEach has found its niche with a different sort of customer, and all three are growing,\u201d says Kim Day, chief executive officer at DIA.\n\nThe Fare Is Fair Tourist destinations Las Vegas and Orlando offered the best average domestic ticket prices for the first quarter of 2018. Lowest average fare Las Vegas $242 Orlando $247 Denver $299 Miami $319 New York LaGuardia $320\n\nSince no airline has more than 50% of Denver\u2019s traffic, \u201cno one gets to dominate the discussion and tell us what to do,\u201d she notes. That frees airport management to spend on improvements even when airlines might prefer cost-cutting.\n\nDenver, Phoenix and Orlando are all strong business and leisure destinations that benefit from ample airline service and low fares. All three airports spend heavily on improvements. (Airports in the U.S. can charge each departing passenger $4.50 built into the ticket price. That helps pay for major construction projects.)\n\nOrlando now has a customer-service department that trains all airport employees, from fast-food workers to skycaps to TSA officers, on how to make eye contact, be productive and pick up trash. The airport hands out recognition awards.\n\n\u201cOur challenge is we\u2019ve got frequent fliers and we\u2019ve got infrequent fliers and sometimes that\u2019s a volatile mix, because the frequent fliers never want to get [stuck waiting] behind the infrequent fliers,\u201d says Phillip Brown, CEO of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority. \u201cWe really need to try and figure out better ways to accommodate both.\u201d\n\nJournal readers voiced particular fondness of smaller, less-crowded airports, but the rankings focus only on larger airports that dominate travel and together share unique challenges of accommodating 30 million to 100 million passengers a year each.\n\nAmong big airports, readers graded Detroit, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Denver highest. Bringing up the rear? New York LaGuardia, Los Angeles, Newark, New York Kennedy and Philadelphia.\n\nUber-Expensive No airport averaged a higher cost of an UberX ride to city center than New York\u2019s JFK. Charlotte and Phoenix tied for the lowest, with just under $13. Most expensive UberX fares from airport to convention center New York JFK $67 Newark $49 Chicago $48 New York LaGuardia $44 Seattle $42\n\nBig hubs dominated by a single major airline would seem to be at a disadvantage in the WSJ rankings because they typically suffer from delays and higher fares. But Atlanta, where Delta carries 73% of passengers, and DFW, where American controls 69% of traffic, proved much stronger in other categories than other large hubs.\n\nAtlanta benefits from Delta\u2019s strong reliability\u2014it had the second-best on-time arrivals rate among all airports. Both ATL and DFW have expanded with low-fare carrier competition and spent heavily on refurbishing terminals and improving services. Atlanta, for example, invested in a new Wi-Fi system that scored third-fastest in Ookla\u2019s Speedtest for airports conducted January to April this year.\n\nReaders praised Atlanta\u2019s clean and modern amenities, appreciating the ease of catching flights and making connections even though the airport is the world\u2019s busiest. High on the list: food options, efficient underground train service and good airline clubs.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to get to parking, terminals and gates, and there is usually a good flow through TSA checkpoints,\u201d says reader Thaddeus Roppel of Auburn, Ala. \u201cGround transportation is reasonably easy to access and the nearby freeway infrastructure makes getting to downtown or suburbs fairly straightforward. If only Atlanta traffic were as well-managed.\u201d\n\nDFW has flights to more cities nonstop than any other U.S. airport, the third-lowest average TSA wait time and, after major effort by the airport to boost offerings, the second-highest food ranking. The airport has recently spent $2 billion updating its three oldest terminals.\n\nBut DFW CEO Sean Donohue says sometimes what matters most to travelers are the simple things. The airport made a decision three years ago to spend $5 million more to raise janitorial wages and the frequency of bathroom cleaning. Another recent improvement: High-tech glass that helps lower the temperature in terminals on hot Texas days. After installation, sales at one bar doubled.\n\nReader Jeff Terry scored DFW best in his evaluation. \u201cShortest car to gate. Most destinations. Great amenities. Many entry points thru security. Good inter-terminal transit. Easy to get to. #1 globally no doubt,\u201d he says.\n\nExplore the Airports\n\nAtlanta | Boston | Charlotte | Chicago | Dallas-Fort Worth | Denver | Detroit | Houston | Las Vegas | Los Angeles | Miami | Minneapolis-St. Paul | Newark | New York JFK | New York LaGuardia | Orlando | Philadelphia | Phoenix | San Francisco | Seattle-Tacoma\n\nWrite to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nDenver posted high scores in reliability, value and convenience in the WSJ Airport Rankings.

The stock had climbed 85% over the past year through Tuesday\u2019s close.\n\nMacy\u2019s Chief Executive Jeff Gennette told analysts on a conference call that the company was seeing improved results in its brick-and-mortar stores as well as e-commerce, which increased sales by double-digits compared with a year ago.\n\nHe said he felt confident heading into the important year-end quarter because consumer confidence and spending remained high, and many of Macy\u2019s strategic initiatives are starting to pay off.\n\nThe company has been investing in a group of stores it calls magnets, adding new lighting, fixtures, a better assortment of merchandising and technological innovations, while embarking on an experiment to shrink other less-promising locations.\n\nMr. Gennette said sales at the 50 magnet stores that have been renovated so far this year are running ahead of the company average and in some cases, sales in those stores have returned to positive territory after several years of declines.\n\nMacy\u2019s is also getting a lift from adding its Backstage discount concept to existing department stores and rolling out new ways for consumers to shop, including allowing them to buy online and pick up items in stores. Mr. Gennette says shoppers tend to spend an additional 25% when they pick up their online orders in a store.\n\nTwo-thirds of Macy\u2019s customers rated their shopping experience as good or very good, up from 59% a year ago, according to research firm GlobalData Retail.\n\n\u201cOur data also show that for the first time in over eight years, the number of people saying they will visit Macy\u2019s to do holiday shopping has risen,\u201d Neil Saunders, a GlobalData managing director said.\n\nAnalysts warned that despite the progress in the current quarter, Macy\u2019s faces a tough sales comparison in the current quarter given that same-store sales in the year-ago period increased 1.3%.\n\nMacy\u2019s raised its sales and earnings guidance for the year. The company now expects sales to increase 0.3% to 0.7% up from previous guidance of a flat to 0.7% increase. Earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 versus previous guidance of $3.95 to $4.15.\n\nWrite to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jay Greene", "title": "Cisco Revenue Rises as Company Avoids Tariff Effects", "description": "Cisco Systems is one of a few tech giants under threat from the U.S.\u2019s trade fight with China, but the company said it has evaded damage from tariffs so far.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cisco-revenue-rises-as-software-business-grows-1542231022", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37065/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T02:45:42Z", "content": "Cisco Systems Inc.

Now, JPMorgan JPM -0.92% Chase & Co. wants them to tap at checkout instead.\n\nThe bank will soon begin issuing cards with a contactless feature, allowing consumers the option of tapping them at stores\u2019 payment terminals rather than inserting them. The bank said the change, announced Wednesday, is meant to simplify and speed up the in-store checkout process.\n\nJPMorgan isn\u2019t the first U.S. bank to issue such cards, but its move could be a tipping point for the rest of the industry to follow suit. The bank is among the biggest U.S. credit-card issuers by purchase volume, and it plans to add the feature to all its Visa Inc. credit cards and debit cards. More broadly, the change underscores the card networks\u2019 campaigns to encourage consumers to ditch cash, even for small purchases.\n\nA big change to the card industry came about three years ago, when issuers began rolling out chip-based cards in the U.S. Those cards, with embedded security chips, are more secure compared with cards that can only be swiped. But they also led to consumer complaints about the slowness of in-store transactions. Major card networks later decided to stop requiring consumers\u2019 signatures, in part to save time at checkout.\n\nAbeer Bhatia, president of card marketing, pricing and innovation of JPMorgan\u2019s credit-card division, said inserting chip cards at checkout wasn\u2019t customer friendly. The new contactless cards will retain a chip, which generates a unique one-time code, that will still be read at the terminal.\n\nTransactions that involve inserting chip cards take an average of about 10 seconds, according to Visa, and tap transactions take an average of a second.\n\nOnly about half of chip-based terminals at U.S. merchant locations accept contactless payments, according to research and advisory firm Aite Group, though that is up from 33% in 2016.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a flood of contactless cards in the market next year, that may drive up interest by the merchants\u201d to accept card payments with a tap, said Thad Peterson, senior payments analyst at Aite.\n\nVisa is the largest U.S. debit and credit card network, and J.P. Morgan is among its largest card issuers. Visa said that no other large bank on its network has moved to make the switch for all its cards.\n\nThe new cards could also deal a blow to the mobile wallets that have launched in recent years. One of their main selling points has been that they are easier to use for in-store payments than chip cards, though they have largely failed to take off with consumers.\n\nJPMorgan customers whose credit cards are up for renewal and those who sign up for new credit cards will be among the first to receive contactless cards starting in the coming weeks. The bank will also make this switch for debit cards starting in the second half of the year.\n\nOther issuers in the Visa and Mastercard Inc. networks already have the feature on some cards. A Mastercard spokesman said issuers representing two-thirds of its U.S. consumer purchase volume have committed to reissuing contactless cards over the next two years.\n\nCitigroup Inc.\u2019s Costco credit card has been contactless enabled since it was introduced in 2016. Capital One Financial Corp. began adding contactless technology to some of its credit cards last year. American Express Co. has added the contactless feature to its Hilton credit card and some others and is changing cards for U.S. consumers who request it.\n\nWrite to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Nick Timiraos", "title": "Fed Tracking World Growth Worries, Powell Says", "description": "\u201cYou still see solid growth, but you see growing signs of a bit of a slowdown,\u201d Jerome Powell, chairman of the central bank, said at a Dallas event. \u201cAnd it is concerning.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-tracking-world-growth-worries-chairman-powell-says-1542242914", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37151/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T02:35:55Z", "content": "DALLASFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was closely monitoring a modest deceleration in global growth, whose strength last year had provided an important tailwind for the U.S. economy.

WYNN -1.32% , wrongly delivered to gambling regulators communications that they said were privileged and should have stayed private.\n\nThey first filed the request for an injunction and damages last week, followed Tuesday by a motion for a temporary restraining order that would stop Massachusetts from releasing a report that they said they believed will rely in part on the attorney communications.\n\nElaine Driscoll, director of communications for the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, said in a statement that the commission has retained legal representation in Nevada to defend against Mr. Wynn\u2019s claims, which she called baseless.\n\nMr. Wynn\u2019s attorneys, who include Donald Campbell, said in correspondence with representatives of the casino commission that Mr. Campbell had been working privately for Mr. Wynn and had an implicit joint-representation agreement with Wynn Resorts when Mr. Wynn ran the company. Mr. Campbell filed that correspondence in Nevada court alongside his initial complaint against Massachusetts regulators and the company.\n\nMassachusetts regulators responded that Mr. Campbell seemed to be working for the company for some matters and that he hadn\u2019t met the burden of proving that a joint-defense agreement existed.\n\nMr. Campbell didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMichael Weaver, a spokesman for Wynn Resorts, said the company had no comment. In a letter sent to Mr. Campbell, a lawyer for Wynn Resorts said the company hoped Mr. Wynn could resolve the matter directly with the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.\n\nThe Massachusetts commission oversees a casino-resort that Wynn Resorts is building outside of Boston. It announced its investigation in January, triggered by an article in The Wall Street Journal that detailed allegations that Mr. Wynn had paid $7.5 million to a manicurist at his Wynn Las Vegas resort who in 2005 told people Mr. Wynn had forced her to have sex with him, and other allegations that cumulatively would reflect a decadeslong pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Wynn.\n\nMr. Wynn has said the idea that he would assault a woman is \u201cpreposterous.\u201d An attorney for Mr. Wynn has previously sent a statement on his behalf saying he \u201cdeclined to participate in The Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting because it is clear that the Journal has no intention of treating him fairly.\u201d\n\nMr. Wynn, who once was synonymous with the company he founded, resigned and sold his ownership interest in it. That meant that he no longer was the subject of investigation by gambling regulators regarding the Boston resort.\n\nMassachusetts regulators, however, continued to conduct a robust investigation into how the company and other licensed executives handled the misconduct allegations, interviewing numerous current and former employees. The agency has also combed through internal company emails, according to Mr. Wynn\u2019s recent court filings.\n\nIt is completing its investigative report now, and had planned to show the report to commissioners and then hold hearings about its contents in early December, making them public then, according to a person familiar with the matter. That could be delayed while the current dispute is resolved.\n\nMr. Wynn\u2019s effort is unusual, according to gambling regulatory experts. However, in Nevada, where Mr. Wynn has done much of his business over the years, gambling regulators don\u2019t release investigation reports. If the state takes action against companies or individuals, then it releases complaints that outline allegations of wrongdoing. The company and the regulators often settle, resulting in a fine without public hearings.\n\nWrite to Alexandra Berzon at alexandra.berzon@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Mark Maremont", "title": "Whitaker Said to Demand Website Remove Posts About Patent Firm", "description": "The owner of a consumer website that published criticisms about the patent firm that acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker once served as an adviser said Mr. Whitaker called up angry about the posts\u2014and demanded they be taken down.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whitaker-said-to-angrily-demand-website-remove-posts-about-patent-firm-1542240851", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37088/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T02:02:11Z", "content": "In early 2015, an anonymous comment accusing a Florida company of being a scam was posted on a consumer website called RipoffReport.com.

Extracts from the plant are often featured in supplements marketed as combating memory loss. Photo: Zhu Zheng/Xinhua/Zuma Press\n\nA third product the watchdog tested, which was marketed as a fish-oil supplement, contained fish oil as advertised, though at higher levels than stated on its label.\n\nThe GAO, which conducted the tests at the request of two U.S. senators, said it would send the results to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for review and potentially further investigation. The GAO declined to identify the manufacturers of the products.\n\nThe problematic Ginkgo biloba products don\u2019t represent the supplement industry\u2019s products as a whole, said Duffy MacKay, senior vice president of science and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group whose members include supplement companies.\n\n\u201cWe are just as upset by any fraudulent material that might enter the supply chain,\u201d he said. \u201cOur consumer is our most important resource.

Some 80,000 kinds of supplements were sold in 2016, up from about 4,000 in 1994, the GAO said in its report. Nearly $133 billion in supplements were sold in the U.S. in 2016, according to the most recent data from Zion Market Research.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe benefits\u2014and safety\u2014of their use have long concerned doctors and public-health professionals, and triggered government probes.\n\nOregon\u2019s attorney general filed a lawsuit in 2015 against GNC Holdings Inc. for allegedly selling dietary products containing illegal ingredients. Last April, the FDA ordered a Las Vegas company to recall its supplements made from powdered kratom, a plant native to Southeast Asia, due to salmonella risk.\n\nSupplements aren\u2019t regulated like medicines and other products taken to improve health. The FDA doesn\u2019t review supplements\u2019 safety or effectiveness, as it does with prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines. Supplement manufacturers and distributors are subsequently responsible for ensuring the safety of their products.\n\nPieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston who studies the safety of supplements, said inaccurate labels are a common problem and show the need for greater oversight of the products.\n\n\u201cRight now the FDA doesn\u2019t even know how many different products are out there,\u201d Dr. Cohen said.\n\nSupplements containing Ginkgo biloba extract, made from one of the world\u2019s oldest living tree species, are often bought by consumers trying to prevent or treat age-related memory loss, the GAO said. The supplements had $78 million in sales in 2015, according to the GAO.\n\nThere is no \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d the extract is helpful for any health condition, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, a part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nAn FDA spokeswoman said the agency plans to review the GAO report and take any appropriate action afterward.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nSome 80,000 kinds of dietary supplements were sold in 2016, up from about 4,000 in 1994, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a report.
