A core of a few dozen old friends and relatives, enlivened by surprise guests\u2014once we had an Indian maharajah in a turban\u2014gather with their children for Thanksgiving. It\u2019s a varied, bubbling, modern crew: former spouses, co-workers, step children, the woman across the street. Every year after dinner we put on a play about Thanksgiving. Everyone takes part\u2014a broadcast journalist is Samoset, a grade-schooler is a Pilgrim woman, a businessman is Lincoln.\n\nThere is a narrator, whose job it is to intone: \u201cIn the year of our Lord 1609 a hardy group of dissenting Christian Protestants, called Pilgrims, left their native England in hopes of finding religious freedom abroad. They tried Holland, but it didn\u2019t work. And so they decided to leave old Europe, and journey to what was called . . . the New World.\u201d\n\nIn September 1620 they set sail from Plymouth, England, on a ship called the Mayflower. Aboard were about 100 passengers, among whom roughly were 40 were Pilgrims, who came to call themselves Saints. The remaining were called Strangers, not religious dissenters necessarily but a mixed lot of tradesmen, debtors, dreamers and I hope a brigand or two. If you\u2019re going to start a new nation it might as well be an interesting one.\n\nThe journey would be long, just over two months, and hard. The seas were high, the wind against them, hunger spread, disease followed. People got on each others\u2019 nerves. Disagreements arose among Saints and Strangers.\n\nHere the kids read their parts with great enthusiasm.\n\nSAINT: \u201cStranger, you do not worship as I do or dress as I dress. You are odd! This makes me want to ignore you, and forget to give you bread at dinner.\u201d\n\nSTRANGER: \u201cSaint, you people wear funny hats, and strange buckles on your shoes. You take your religion seriously, which is nice, but God wanted us to have a sense of humor, too. Please don\u2019t be so stern and righteous.\u201d\n\nAt this point of course comes forward Pilgrim leader William Bradford. He\u2019s usually played by a distinguished guest.\n\nBRADFORD: \u201cGentlemen and ladies, there is no need to fight. We are not enemies, but friends. We are fleeing Old Europe\u2014together. We journey to a new home\u2014together. We will make our lives on the new continent\u2014together. Let\u2019s think things through and create a new arrangement to better order our relations.\u201d\n\nAnd so they did. Meetings were held, debates ensued, agreement reached. There would be full equality between Saints and Strangers. They would govern themselves by majority rule. They would mark their unity by calling themselves by one name: Pilgrims. All the Pilgrim gentlemen signed this agreement, which they called the Mayflower Compact.\n\nIt was the first, great founding document of what would become the United States of America.\n\nHere sometimes someone goes, \u201cHear, Hear!\u201d\n\nNow land is sighted, Cape Cod. A Pilgrim girls shouts \u201cLand ahoe! Hard to starboard! Mainfast the jibney!\u201d She\u2019s talking gibberish because she\u2019s excited: It\u2019s the New World!\n\nThe Mayflower eventually finds a small natural harbor, named years before by Captain John Smith. It is called Plymouth. In time, one by one, the Pilgrims disembark and step upon Plymouth Rock.\n\nHere\u2014hokily, happily\u2014we have a brief moment of silence.\n\nBuilding a settlement is hard going, snow and sleet slow things. Almost half the Pilgrims died.\n\nThen springtime, and a miracle. A lone Indian brave walked into the settlement. The Pilgrims were afraid\u2014they\u2019d never seen an Indian up close. The brave, Samoset, sensed and understood their fear, and said to them the one word he knew in English: \u201cWelcome.\u201d\n\nThey invited him to stay the night. He did, and later returned with another Indian named Squanto.\n\nOur young friend George usually plays this part, because of his ebullience.\n\nSQUANTO: \u201cHello. Good to meet you! I have known many English over the years. In fact I\u2019ve been to England. The Captain of one of his majesty\u2019s vessels took me there a few years ago. I learned the King\u2019s English and people were good to me, and now I return the favor. I will teach you how to tap maple trees for sap to turn into syrup. I\u2019ll show you which plants can be turned into medicine, and which are poisonous. I\u2019ll teach you how to grow and harvest Indian Corn. I\u2019ll show you where to fish.\u201d\n\nSquanto saved their lives. Harvests improved, and in time the Pilgrims had enough food to put away for winter\u2014vegetables, fish packed in salt and cured over fires.\n\nThe Pilgrims wanted to thank God. And so their new governor\u2014William Bradford, of compact fame\u2014proclaimed a formal day of gratitude.\n\nHere in the play Bradford stands and ringingly invites everyone\u2014the settlers, Indians, parents and children, to meet, pray and thank Providence for the abundance with which they\u2019ve been blessed.\n\nBradford\u2019s speech gave us our sweetest memory of the play. Our friend Harry, editor and Englishman, had become an American citizen. He was so moved by Bradford\u2019s words his voice broke. His wife hugged him, and we all went AAHHHHH.\n\nEveryone came to the first Thanksgiving\u2014Squanto and 90 braves and their families. There were foot races and games. The braves demonstrated their prowess with the bow and arrow, the Pilgrims with their muskets. One man played a drum. Everyone ate together at big tables and on blankets.\n\nYears later, George Washington proclaimed a day of thanksgiving, as America won it\u2019s war of independence. But it was Abe Lincoln who, in 1863, formally declared Thanksgiving a national holiday. In our play, as in his proclamation, he readily acknowledges the horror of the Civil War, but then takes a very American turn. There is much to celebrate. Peace has been preserved between America and all other nations. Harmony has prevailed everywhere except the theatre of direct battle. Our population has increased. We have every reason to expect a \u201clarge increase of freedom.\u201d No human hand has done this. \u201c(These) are the gracious gifts of the most high God.\u201d\n\nAt the end, the players declare their hopes for the future:\n\nSAMOSET: \u201cFor the broad establishment of peace,\u201d\n\nPILGRIM GIRL: \u201cFor the spreading of prosperity,\u201d\n\nSQUANTO: \u201cFor increases in human health, and great strides in the areas of human inquiry and invention,\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON: \u201cFor the continuance of our Republic,\u201d\n\nLINCOLN: \u201cAnd the deepening of our democracy,\u201d\n\nBRADFORD: \u201cThat ye remember with special gratitude Squanto and his little ones and tribe, who were so very kind to the Pilgrims in those hard days long ago.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAnd so our little play, put on again this year, in the heart of sophisticated Manhattan. I\u2019m always struck: there\u2019s such division in America, and so much country-love. I don\u2019t know the political views of all our players. I\u2019d put most as moderate liberals, with me a confessed conservative. But halfway through our show we are captains and Indians and presidents. We are moved by the story of how we began. We honor it. And we are not saints and strangers but pilgrims, together."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Joseph C.

Should the social-media giant remove misleading and vile content, opening itself to charges of censorship? Or is it better to take a laissez faire approach and let falsehoods spread unchecked, even if it invites criticism from politicians?\n\nNow chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg find themselves at the center of a viral fake-news story. The New York Times last week published a story purporting that Facebook executives whitewashed Russia\u2019s use of their platform to spread misinformation during the 2016 election, among other lapses, and then employed crude tactics to deflect public furor.\n\nThe left\u2019s reaction has been as overblown as the story. \u201cEmbattled and in over his head, Mark Zuckerberg should\u2014at least\u2014step down as Facebook chairman,\u201d read a Washington Post column. A Times media columnist chimed in: \u201cThe Facebook Movie Told Us What We Needed to Know About Mark Zuckerberg.\u201d Hint: It isn\u2019t flattering.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal proclaimed the Times story another \u201cchilling reminder that big tech can no longer be trusted.\u201d Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Mr. Blumenthal and two other Democratic Senators demanded that the Justice Department investigate whether Facebook hid information and retaliated against critics.\n\nBoth Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have sidestepped responsibility for Facebook\u2019s alleged transgressions. \u201cThe reality of running a company of more than 10,000 people is that you\u2019re not going to know everything that\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. Perhaps, but Facebook\u2019s root problem seems to be that its leaders refuse to assume responsibility or control over anything.\n\nFacebook\u2018s Sheryl Sandberg testifies on Capitol Hill on Sept. 5. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Times, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare alerted former chief security officer Alex Stamos in spring 2016 that hackers were using the platform to search for people connected to the presidential campaigns. Mr. Stamos directed an internal security team to probe Russian activity on the platform, but he didn't inform Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg until December 2016\u2014after the CEO called the idea that Russian ads influenced the outcome of the election \u201ccrazy.\u201d Not until September 2017 did Facebook publicly disclose their discoveries.\n\nBut there\u2019s still zero evidence that Russian Facebook ads were a decisive factor, or even a significant one, in the outcome of the election. Justice officials at the time also played down the extent of Russian intervention for fear their warnings would be perceived as partisan.\n\nThe Obama administration refrained from retaliating against Russia until December 2016 because officials were ostensibly worried about provoking Vladimir Putin. Not until earlier this year did special counsel Robert Mueller\u2014armed with information shared by Facebook\u2014charge Russian agents involved in the social-media misinformation conspiracy. So Facebook shares responsibility with the government for delaying disclosure and action against Russia\u2019s political intervention.\n\nAmid a political backlash, Facebook enlisted a conservative public-relations firm, Definers Public Affairs, to push back against criticisms and defuse the fury. \u201cOn a conservative news site called the NTK Network,\u201d the Times notes, \u201cdozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices\u201d and \u201cplayed down the impact of the Russians\u2019 use of Facebook.\u201d The firm also linked liberal groups protesting Facebook to George Soros.\n\nEmploying PR firms to shape media narratives and challenge the credibility of opponents\u2014whether competitors or critics\u2014is a standard business practice. Liberals use the same ugly tactic of smearing opponents by linking them to the Koch brothers. More disturbing is Ms. Sandberg\u2019s claim last week that she was unaware that Definers had been hired.\n\nThe Times story also makes much of how Facebook executives tried to win favor with Democrats in Congress. For instance, while all other tech companies were opposed to Sen. Blumenthal\u2019s legislation making platforms liable for sex-trafficking ads, Facebook last fall endorsed it. Facebook has also endorsed Sen. Klobuchar\u2019s Honest Ads Act that requires more stringent disclosures for political ads.\n\nAll of this underscores the futility of trying to mollify politicians. But more troubling than Facebook\u2019s charm offensive is its executives\u2019 apparent preference for being regulated by Washington rather than regulating themselves. Mr. Zuckerberg even recently suggested that a Supreme Court \u201cmade up of independent folks who don\u2019t work for Facebook\u201d could be trusted to \u201cultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community.\u201d Facebook\u2019s problem is that its executives take the same hands-off approach to running their company as they do to managing the platform.\n\nOne irony is that Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg are now being pilloried by the same sort of liberal mob they have allowed to rule their company. After Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global public policy, appeared at his friend Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate interrogation in October, employees protested. Andrew Bosworth, Facebook\u2019s virtual reality head, then told employees \u201cIf you need to change teams, companies or careers to make sure your day-to-day life matches your passions, we will be sad to see you go, but we will understand.\u201d Following worker complaints of insensitivity, Mr. Bosworth apologized.\n\nIf Facebook executives don\u2019t want to take ownership of what happens in their company or on their platform\u2014if they would prefer to yield control to their workers, users and the government\u2014then perhaps they should go.\n\nMs. Finley is a member of the Journal\u2019s editorial board."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Daniel Lee", "title": "Could the Internet Power a Small-Town Renaissance?", "description": "Online retailers are doing to the mall what the mall once did to my hometown of Princeton, Indiana.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/could-the-internet-power-a-small-town-renaissance-1542844575", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CL082_LEEDAN_SOC_20181120113443.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T23:56:17Z", "content": "This time of year, the late-night sky southeast of the city sparkles with what looks like a long line of evening stars: transport jets carrying thousands of boxes of online purchases to the FedEx hub at Indianapolis International Airport.

They rumble overhead at 90-second intervals, wingtip navigation lights blinking in festive red and green. The planes are essentially airborne department stores flying in to replace the brick-and-mortar retail shops gradually giving way to internet shopping. By 2022, Credit Suisse has estimated, 1 in 4 U.S. shopping malls will close.\n\nOn the Indianapolis southside, where I live, the Greenwood Park Mall\u2019s Sears is greeting the Christmas season with cheery \u201cStore Closing\u201d banners. It\u2019s one of about 500 stores the legacy retailer has closed since 2008.\n\nThere\u2019s good news: 2018 holiday hiring should reach 704,000 new employees, according to Chicago-based job-placement firm Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, Inc. The record, from 2014, was 696,000. The bad news for traditional retail is that Amazon will get about 100,000 of those workers and FedEx 55,000. Seasonal hires used to hand goods to customers with a smile; these days, many work in warehouses shipping goods far away.\n\nGrowing up in Princeton, Ind., the seat of Gibson County in the southwest corner of Indiana in the 1960s, I saw local commerce undergo a different transformation. I was reminded of it last Christmas, when somebody on Facebook posted a grainy film snippet of Princeton\u2019s courthouse square on Christmas Eve, 1953. Men in flapping long coats clutched unironic fedoras against a biting wind. Women in headscarves protecting holiday hairdos shooed their excited children along. Farmers and workmen hurried through the frame, giving jerky, self-conscious waves before ducking into Beckner\u2019s Jewelers, Shelby Stevens Fine Clothes, The Model, G.C. Murphy, Western Auto, J.C. Penney \u2014all gone now.\n\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images\n\nVillages like Princeton\u2014population about 8,000 when I knew it\u2014were worlds almost unto themselves right up until midcentury. In the 1950s, when that Christmas Eve was caught on film, U.S. 41 went four-lane and soon drained most local trade 30 miles south to Evansville, which had a shopping mall and a riverfront museum. It also had a McDonald\u2019s , whose urbane, skinny french fries made our plump hometown fries look like fat peasant fingers. Stores closed, one by one, until courthouse square was a desert of T-shirt imprinting shops, here-and-gone cafes, Bible bookstores, antique malls, and\u2014the final stop\u2014consignment stores.\n\nBut now it\u2019s the city retailers\u2019 turn to watch their livelihoods going away, as the internet has paved a new kind of highway, with many more than four lanes, sucking away their share of possibly the most covetous consumer culture in history. Thirty minutes on Amazon.com accomplishes what used to take a logistically complicated day, including two hours wedged into a station wagon fighting heavy traffic and sometimes daunting weather.\n\nGeographically remote communities are now on a level playing field when it comes to shopping. It\u2019s one of the paradoxes of the internet age\u2014the social isolation of outlying rural communities from their nearby metropolitan centers, even as they connect digitally with the entire world.\n\nMeanwhile, the decline of the mall is creating new opportunities as entrepreneurs refashion abandoned retail space into parks, apartments, walk-in health clinics and even bowling alleys. The Greenwood Park Mall\u2019s owners demolished the wing that had housed L.S. Ayers, a now defunct department store, replacing it with a line of Main Street-style shops and several midmarket restaurants. They put in a fountain, and there\u2019s live music in the summer. At Christmas, shoppers bustle out of the winter wind into the haven of warm, candle-scented shops. Sometimes it looks and feels a little like that grainy 1953 film.\n\nNow that small-town shoppers are finding their way home again\u2014online and in faux small-town scenes\u2014it would be poetic if the trend rebounded back to America\u2019s actual small towns. People won\u2019t travel an hour to buy a sweater when they can do it on their laptop at home, but they\u2019ll drive 20 minutes to eat at a nice bistro in a pleasantly rustic, county-seat storefront\u2014perhaps with a fountain and some live music.\n\nSmall towns like Princeton need to recognize the opportunity and gear up for the effort, or watch it slip away. Last December there was precious little information on the town\u2019s website about holiday events. Christmas was misspelled.\n\nSigh.\n\nThere\u2019s work to be done.

Even those who journey through its Northeastern complex, into the Southern lands, across the central plains and to its Western slopes can only glimpse a measure of the bounty of America.\n\nAnd a traveler cannot but be struck on his journey by the thought that this country, one day, can be even greater. America, though many know it not, is one of the great underdeveloped countries of the world; what it reaches for exceeds by far what it has grasped.\n\nSo the visitor returns thankful for much of what he has seen, and, in spite of everything, an optimist about what his country might be. Yet the visitor, if he is to make an honest report, must also note the air of unease that hangs everywhere.\n\nFor the traveler, as travelers have been always, is as much questioned as questioning. And for all the abundance he sees, he finds the questions put to him ask where men may repair for succor from the troubles that beset them.\n\nHis countrymen cannot forget the savage face of war. Too often they have been asked to fight in strange and distant places, for no clear purpose they could see and for no accomplishment they can measure. Their spirits are not quieted by the thought that the good and pleasant bounty that surrounds them can be destroyed in an instant by a single bomb. Yet they find no escape, for their survival and comfort now depend on unpredictable strangers in far-off corners of the globe.\n\nHow can they turn from melancholy when at home they see young arrayed against old, black against white, neighbor against neighbor, so that they stand in peril of social discord. Or not despair when they see that the cities and countryside are in need of repair, yet find themselves threatened by scarcities of the resources that sustain their way of life. Or when, in the face of these challenges, they turn for leadership to men in high places\u2014only to find those men as frail as any others.\n\nSo sometimes the traveler is asked whence will come their succor. What is to preserve their abundance, or even their civility? How can they pass on to their children a nation as strong and free as the one they inherited from their forefathers? How is their country to endure these cruel storms that beset it from without and from within?\n\nOf course the stranger cannot quiet their spirits. For it is true that everywhere men turn their eyes today much of the world has a truly wild and savage hue. No man, if he be truthful, can say that the specter of war is banished. Nor can he say that when men or communities are put upon their own resources they are sure of solace; nor be sure that men of diverse kinds and diverse views can live peaceably together in a time of troubles.\n\nBut we can all remind ourselves that the richness of this country was not born in the resources of the earth, though they be plentiful, but in the men that took its measure. For that reminder is everywhere\u2014in the cities, towns, farms, roads, factories, homes, hospitals, schools that spread everywhere over that wilderness.\n\nWe can remind ourselves that for all our social discord we yet remain the longest enduring society of free men governing themselves without benefit of kings or dictators. Being so, we are the marvel and the mystery of the world, for that enduring liberty is no less a blessing than the abundance of the earth.\n\nAnd we might remind ourselves also, that if those men setting out from Delftshaven had been daunted by the troubles they saw around them, then we could not this autumn be thankful for a fair land.\n\nThis editorial has appeared annually since 1961."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Nina Sovich", "title": "Europe in Winter: 35 Reasons to Visit Off-Season", "description": "Insider advice on how to spend the winter season in some of Europe\u2019s top destinations\u2014from Paris to Stockholm.

The shops stay open unusually late. Holiday decorations are abundant. Each country honors traditions that date back a thousand years\u2014fish for Italians on Christmas Eve, bearded Tomte bearing gifts in Sweden, Sinterklaas in the Netherlands. For one month the common cause of Christmas unites a continent that\u2019s often at odds with itself.\n\nFinding pleasure in the months of January and February is another matter entirely. The decorations come down and reality sets in. For most of Europe, that means rain. It rains in Rome, it drizzles in Berlin, it showers in Paris and London. Escaping above the clouds to the (sometimes) sunny Alps helps, but ski holidays are a temporary balm on a deep wound.\n\nFor visitors, however, the down season brings opportunity. You can find cheaper flights, easily book hotels and wander museums practically alone. Restaurants are still filled, but with locals as opposed to annoying tourists. Spontaneity becomes an option. I once spent a week in the South of France in January driving between Aix en Provence, Avignon and Arles. I ate in tiny restaurants in tiny villages, slept in any hotel I wanted and received discounts without even asking for them. I didn\u2019t make a single reservation.\n\nLater I moved to Paris, where I lived for 10 years with a busy husband and small children. Some winters, I was blue. Eventually, I found that I needed to lean into the season. I went to see the Winged Victory of Samothrace in the Louvre and stood before the sculpture, just me and her, for an eyebrow-raising amount of time. I blew off my gym membership for months at a time. I shopped the markets with real purpose and no thought at all to my waistline. Mont d\u2019Or cheese for dinner three nights a week. Fresh hazelnuts in a bowl in the living room for anyone to crack. I still remember the excitement that came when oranges from Egypt arrived in January. The entire neighborhood was abuzz.\n\nI sat for hours on trains racing across gray and frosty countryside and thought about the arc of my life in deep and philosophical terms. I skied in the French Alps, in the Austrian Alps. I learned to avoid the difficult runs and stop in cafes by wooded trails and eat my body weight in fondue. I ate dinner outside while my children sledded down mountainsides lit only by bonfires and tiki torches. I began to see the late winter as a time to think, be with my family, enjoy all that was dark and quiet.\n\nFor pointers on how to spend the off season, as well as the Christmas holidays\u2014and how not to spend them\u2014in some favorite European cities, we asked eight insiders for winter highlights and lowlights.\n\nIllustration: SANNA MANDER\n\nVienna\n\nLilli Hollein\n\nDirector of Vienna Design Week\n\nWINTER PERK: If a city could be a season, Vienna would be winter. It can be covered in glamorous white that makes the gold on buildings like Kirche am Steinhof even shinier. It can be grumpy and gray. It is cold. You always have an excuse to go to the next kaffeehaus. I love Caf\u00e9 Pr\u00fcckel in winter (prueckel.at). You can eat heavy food at Gasthaus Wolf\u2014they serve mostly intestines and take \u201cnose to tail\u201c seriously (gasthauswolf.at). You need something substantial to eat because you spend your nights waltzing, as it is the ball season. I absolutely recommend the annual Vienna Philharmonic Ball (if you can get tickets).\n\nA DRIVE YOU DON\u2019T NEED TO SHOVEL Belvedere Palace and Museum in Vienna in February 2018. Photo: Pan Xu Xinhua/Eyevine/Redux\n\nWINTER GRIPE: Between November and Christmas you\u2019ll find dozens of little huts in front of many of my favorite Vienna museums, like the Mumok or the Kunsthistorisches Museum. These huts smell of disgusting alcoholic drinks, wurst and sweaty winter coats. They are loud, overcrowded, tasteless. Leaving a museum often calls for a moment of contemplation. Not at this time of the year.\n\nFAVORITE GETAWAY: Altaussee, Austria. It only takes about 90 minutes to walk around the lake. When it is really, really cold you can skate on the lake. Models and other celebrities go to Viva Mayr wellness resort for a detox holiday (vivamayr.com).\n\nCHEER CENTRAL London\u2019s Fortnum & Mason department store in December 2017.

Next spring she\u2019ll be profiled on the sixth season of \u201cChefs Table\u201d on Netflix.\n\nWINTER PERK: My first winter in London I went to Fortnum & Mason because people told me that was the place to go. I had taken the bus to see the city at Christmas and I bought an apple-shaped marzipan. It\u2019s become a ritual now to buy marzipan at Fortnum & Mason every winter.\n\nWINTER GRIPE: Riding the tube is the worst thing about London in winter. Everybody expands with their coats and hats and umbrellas.\n\nFAVORITE GETAWAY: Paris. I love the romance of walking across the bridges there in winter. I\u2019m just so mad that you can\u2019t put locks on the Pont des Arts anymore.\n\nThe Eiffel tower during Christmas illuminations on November 22, 2017 in Paris, France. Photo: Getty Images\n\nParis\n\nWendell Steavenson\n\nParis-based novelist, food writer, war correspondent\n\nWINTER PERK: December is easily my favorite month in Paris. The night draws in and the leaves rustle. Particularly around 6:00 in the evening when you are a little sore from Christmas shopping, you stop in to have a glass of red wine or grog, maybe at Le Nemrod (51 rue du Cherche Midi). Every once in a while, if you are very lucky you can turn a corner and there is the Eiffel tower shimmering and glittering\u2014better than a Christmas tree.\n\nWINTER GRIPE: I once went to Strasbourg for the winter fair and it was, like, I don\u2019t want to spend huge amounts of money on baskets of decorated gingerbread.\n\nFAVORITE GETAWAY: I went to Venice one February and it was genius. We sat al fresco and it was a complete joy to have no tourists, to feel a little bit the old Venice. You don\u2019t have to queue to get on the vaporetto in February. There aren\u2019t hordes of people going over the Accademia. You can linger at the fish market without looking like a complete idiot.\n\nRome\n\nKeith Christiansen\n\nJohn Pope-Hennessy chairman, European Paintings, Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nWINTER PERK: An ideal time for visiting Rome is late February or March. Tourism is still at its low point, but the weather can be amazingly mild and even if it\u2019s chilly, the skies are marvelous and many cafes have space heaters so you can sit outside.\n\nWINTER GRIPE: The short days mean you have to plan your days. The Christmas fairs are kind of a waste and spoil entirely the Piazza Navona. But Christmas mass at Santa Maria in Aracoeli is pretty wonderful.\n\nFAVORITE GETAWAY: Andalusia\u2014Seville, Cordoba, Granada. The smell of oranges, the sun, the mild weather and the freedom from the tourist crush. Naples in winter can be fabulous, and the crazy New Year\u2019s is something to be experienced.\n\nBerlin\n\nAnna Winger\n\nBerlin-based writer and creator of TV series Deutschland 83/86\n\nWINTER PERK: A few years ago friends started this December tradition called the G\u00e4nsemarch\u2014Goose Walk. We take a ferry out to the Pfaueninsel, an island in Wannsee with roaming peacocks and an 18th-century castle (pfaueninsel.info). We walk the perimeter of the island in the cold to work up an appetite then head to the local pub for gluhwein, red cabbage and roasted goose.\n\nWINTER GRIPE: Don\u2019t bother waiting in the long line to get into world-famous techno club Berghain, unless you want to go home with a serious cold. Instead, go see a concert at the new Frank Gehry-designed Pierre Boulez Saal concert hall (boulezsaal.de).\n\nFAVORITE GETAWAY: Hotel Post, Susanne Kaufmann\u2019s family hotel in Bezau, Austria. Kaufmann is well known in Europe for her organic skin care products and spas. This hotel was started by her grandmother in an old post office. The skiing nearby is fantastic and the hotel balances traditional coziness (big fireplaces, great food, saunas) with modern design. The spa is beautiful\u2014and there are indoor tennis courts (hotel-post.co.at).\n\nMadrid\n\nBarbara Lennie\n\nActress appearing in the upcoming film \u201cEverybody Knows\u201d (Feb. 2019)\n\nWINTER PERK: I love buying roasted chestnuts and sweet potatoes from the street vendors, or having hot chocolate and churros in a cafe like San Gin\u00e9s (chocolateriasangines.com) and escaping the cold for a few hours with a movie at the Cine Dor\u00e9 (Calle de Santa Isabel, 3).\n\nWINTER GRIPE: Night comes way too early in Madrid, and at Christmastime the sidewalks of the city center become impossible to navigate due to the crowds.\n\nFAVORITE GETAWAY: Porto in Portugal. It\u2019s home to one of my favorite museums in the world, the Serralves Foundation. It\u2019s set in a garden and has artfully placed windows so no matter how nasty the weather you feel like you\u2019re surrounded by nature (serralves.pt).\n\nSnowy day in Ortakoy, Istanbul, Turkey.

Some of the restaurants along the Bosporus have heated terraces or big windows so you can enjoy the view, and you\u2019ll be surrounded by locals, very few tourists. Two of my favorites are Park Fora (parkfora.com) and Yenik\u00f6y YaliEr (Koybasi Caddesi 145)\u2014both serve fantastically fresh fish.\n\nWINTER GRIPE: The meyhanes [taverns] along \u0130stiklal Caddesi used to be very lively in winter. Now they\u2019re a little sad-looking.\n\nFAVORITE GETAWAY: Florence. In summer, it\u2019s too crowded, but in winter, there\u2019s this special coziness and you can really absorb the city. And all that hearty Florentine food at places like Il Latino (illatino.com) and the Mercato Centrale (mercatocentrale.it) just tastes better in winter. And the service is much better too.\n\nStockholm\n\nSune Malmstr\u00f6m\n\nHotel developer\n\nWINTER PERK: After ice skating at the Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden (the Kings Garden), where the ice rink overlooks the Royal Palace, finish off with some gl\u00f6gg, similar to mulled wine. Of all the winter festivities in Stockholm, my favorite is the celebration of Sankta Lucia at Seglora church. During the peak of winter darkness [in mid December], choirs dressed in white, with candles in their hands, sing winter carols.\n\nWINTER GRIPE: We Swedes indulge in numerous Christmas buffets during the month of December. Overall they tend to be delicious, but it\u2019s super easy to overindulge, so my recommendations to all first timers would be to skip the lutfisk (this dry tasteless overcooked fish) and instead focus on the yummy Swedish meatballs and gravlax.\n\nFAVORITE GETAWAY: Lech am Arlberg in the Austrian alps has amazing skiing conditions set in a very gem\u00fctlich alpine environment. After a full day on the slopes, stop by the Hotel Montana in Oberlech for goulash soup. Sit outside on the spacious deck and wrap yourself in plaid blankets (montanaoberlech.at).\n\n\u2014Edited from interviews by Nina Sovich, Andrew Ferren, Jay Cheshes and Deborah Dunn\n\nCold Calling\n\nChernobyl in January and four other European trip ideas for travelers who actually relish the chill.\n\nHELSINKI Tourists don\u2019t just pack mittens and scarves for winter trips to the Finnish capital, they pack swimsuits for a visit to one of the city\u2019s 13 talviuintipaikat, or winter swimming places\u2014often just holes cut into the ice atop a lake or the Baltic itself. hel.fi/helsinki/en/culture/sports/outdoor/winter-swimming\n\nChernobyl in the winter.

But this Arctic Circle city doesn\u2019t use winter darkness as an excuse to sleep in; if anything, its cultural and sporting opportunities only increase in the depths of winter. Under a sky frequently illuminated by aurora borealis, visitors can set off by sea to watch whales, or across the tundra to visit the indigenous Sami people and attempt to endear themselves to reindeer. Within the city, the Northern Lights cultural festival and the Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival are two bright spots. visittromso.no\n\nEASTERN POLAND The Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, which straddles the Polish-Belarusian border, is one of the last remaining stands of primeval woods in Europe. Visiting it with tour company Wild Poland during their weeklong Winter Wildlife Festival (Jan. 19-26) affords travelers the opportunity to see the continent\u2019s largest population of wild bison, along with more elusive fauna like wolves and lynx. Winter makes for an ideal spotting season because thinner foliage and snow- covered ground makes these animals easier to spy.

The two men, who haven\u2019t been formally charged with any crime, are now in custody at a Tokyo jail and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nMr. Kelly, a U.S. citizen, was one of the few Americans to hold senior leadership roles at a company led mostly by European and Japanese executives. He was also the first and only American to become a senior-ranking director on Nissan\u2019s board when he joined it in 2012, putting him alongside Mr. Ghosn and Hiroto Saikawa, who took over Nissan as CEO last year.\n\nAuto executive, Carlos Ghosn, was the architect of an alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, a rare success story of auto makers working together.

Mr. Saikawa didn\u2019t elaborate on the findings of the investigation, which Nissan brought to prosecutors.\n\nAt the time of their arrest, Messrs. Ghosn and Kelly were in Japan for a board meeting, but they didn\u2019t arrive together, according to people briefed on their plans.\n\nMr. Kelly was viewed within Nissan as wielding considerable influence at the auto maker, where he at one point served as Mr. Ghosn\u2019s most senior aide and controlled his daily schedule; former executives described him as a sort of chief of staff.\n\nThe 62-year-old company veteran was known for being fiercely loyal to Mr. Ghosn, who often turned to him to troubleshoot problems and deal with personnel matters, these people said.\n\n\u201cHe was Carlos Ghosn\u2019s shield.

His other roles as head of corporate communications and the legal department at Nissan gave him some control over the information flow within the company.\n\nThe dramatic arrest of celebrity-CEO Carlos Ghosn is rocking the automotive industry.

As head of human resources in North America, Mr. Kelly hired many of their replacements.\n\nIn 2008, he moved to Japan to run the legal department for Nissan and became the head of the CEO\u2019s office later that year, a job for which he ran board meetings. In 2009, he added the roles of global human resources chief and communications director for Nissan. He joined the board in 2012.\n\nHe would occasionally join close colleagues for a drink after work during his time in Japan, former colleagues said. He limited interactions with most staff in the office to troubleshooting problems, they said.\n\nMr. Kelly was a very professional, \u201cstand-up guy,\u201d and could be extremely cordial, but could be tough when things went sideways, said one of the former executives who worked with him.\n\nMr. Kelly was very close to Mr. Ghosn and worked with him around the clock, even while keeping a low profile, a former executive said.\n\nAs human resources chief, he helped his boss decide on promotions\u2014a role Mr. Kelly\u2019s former subordinate said made employees nervous about crossing him.

At the same time, it plans to open 30 new stores in city centers, and invest in delivery and digital, creating 11,500 new jobs over the next two years. IKEA employs about 160,000 staff.\n\n\u201cThe retail landscape is transforming at a scale and pace we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said Chief Executive Jesper Brodin.\n\nThe restructuring is a rare event for IKEA, which has so far appeared largely immune from the troubles that have hurt big department stores and shopping malls. The last time it cut a large number of jobs was during the financial crisis.\n\nRetailers selling clothing, homeware, digital appliances, toys and even food have struggled to make up for few visitors to their stores as customers increasingly prefer the bargains and convenience of shopping online. Once indomitable retailers like Sears and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us have been felled by the shift.\n\nTolga \u00d6nc\u00fc, IKEA\u2019s head of retail, said in an interview that the job cuts would cut red tape and speed up decision making. He said the new jobs would be focused on enhancing IKEA\u2019s online and delivery offerings as well as the in-store experience.\n\n\u201cSo far as we can recall we haven\u2019t had this before,\u201d he said of the restructuring. \u201cWe do it because we want to secure IKEA for the future.\u201d\n\nMr. \u00d6nc\u00fc said growth in the number of customers visiting its existing stores has stalled, prompting IKEA to change how they look.\n\nThe company\u2019s research has shown that 80% of customers research their planned purchases online before visiting a store. In response, IKEA is cutting the number of products it displays, freeing up space for more mocked up living rooms and bedrooms. Mr. \u00d6nc\u00fc hopes the change will motivate more customers to visit stores.\n\nIKEA plans to open its biggest city-center store to date in Paris in the spring at 5,000 square meters. It also intends to eventually open a city-center store in New York, but this is still at the exploratory stage. If New Yorkers take to the concept, IKEA plans roll out similar stories in cities such as Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco, Mr. \u00d6nc\u00fc said.\n\nFounded in 1943, IKEA initially sold pens, wallets, table runners, watches and nylon stockings. Over the years, it evolved into the world\u2019s largest furniture retailer, selling sleek Scandinavian designs relatively inexpensively and in easy to transport flat packs.\n\nThe company has for decades followed a successful model of opening sprawling, out-of-town stores that act as showrooms, storage depots and restaurants. IKEA opened its first 72,000-square-foot store in 1958 in the Swedish village of \u00c4lmhult, discovering that people were prepared to travel long distances to visit the shop.\n\nMore recently, the company has said that 70% of the world\u2019s population will live in cities by 2050, forcing it to rethink its decades-old strategy. IKEA has tried to make its furniture accessible to more people, opening centrally located stores and click-and-collect sites, improving delivery and rolling out websites in more countries. Last year it bought online marketplace TaskRabbit to make it easier for customers to assemble its shelves, sofas and beds. It has also said it would test selling its furniture on third-party websites.\n\n\u201cWe see of course that the world around us is changing and we want to be part of that,\u201d said Mr. \u00d6nc\u00fc.\n\nLast month, IKEA reported its retail sales for the financial year of \u20ac34.8 billion ($39.69 billion), up just slightly from the \u20ac34.1 billion it reported the prior year.\n\nWrite to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Robert Wall", "title": "Airbus Finalizes New Executive Lineup", "description": "European aerospace giant Airbus appointed two outsiders to key executive jobs, completing a generational overhaul of its executive ranks as it faces challenges building all the planes it has promised.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbus-finalizes-new-executive-line-up-1542791039", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38245/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:54:29Z", "content": "European aerospace giant Airbus SE on Wednesday appointed two outsiders to key executive jobs, completing a generational overhaul of its executive ranks as it struggles to build all the planes it has promised.

Mr. Asam currently holds the top finance job at German semiconductor maker Infineon Technologies AG.\n\nMichael Schollhorn, 53, is set to join from BSH Home Appliances to become chief operating officer at Airbus\u2019s plane-making business.\n\nAirbus is boosting output for some of its most popular planes to meet strong demand. But building all those aircraft has been a problem. Airbus this year cut its plane-delivery forecast, in part because of engine supplier hiccups. Delayed plane deliveries have angered airline customers and weighed on cash flow.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAirbus had at the end of October delivered 584 jetliners against an already lowered full-year target of 800. Many of the planes have already been built, but still need to be fit with their engines before being handed over to customers.\n\nBoeing Co., the world\u2019s No. 1 plane maker, underwent a similar management overhaul a few years ago. It has stuck to its target of handing over 810 to 815 airliners in 2018, despite production difficulties.\n\nAt Airbus, the two latest appointments represent some of the final elements of a revamp that kicked off last year when Chief Executive Tom Enders announced he would retire in 2019 and the head of the plane-making unit, Fabrice Br\u00e9gier, departed. The plane maker\u2019s long-serving chief salesman, John Leahy, retired this year, while other senior executives have left or announced retirement plans.\n\nAirbus last month named the head of the plane-making unit and its effective No. 2, Guillaume Faury, to replace Mr. Enders in April, when Mr. Asam will also join.\n\nNot all of the management changes have been smooth. In September, Airbus named a new chief plane salesman for the second time this year.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Asam, a German, also helps restore the national balance at a company where the passports of top managers are closely monitored. The French and German governments remain the largest shareholders in Airbus. The nationality of the chief executive has switched between French and German after the company in 2007 abandoned a co-CEO structure representing both nationalities.\n\nWith the announcement that Mr. Faury, a Frenchman, would replace Mr. Enders, a German, Airbus also said Frenchman Denis Ranque wouldn\u2019t seek an extension of his role as chairman after 2020. A German is widely expected to be named to the post.\n\nInfineon said the search for a successor to Mr. Asam as CFO has begun.\n\n\u2014Cristina Roca contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jeff Slate", "title": "Was Ringo Starr the Original Instagrammer?", "description": "The former Beatles drummer on how he invented the social-media trope of taking photos of your food and almost chased his country music dreams.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/was-ringo-starr-the-original-instagrammer-1542820050", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CL234_20ODD_SOC_20181120164030.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:50:09Z", "content": "RELAXED IN black, a backward cap and his ever-present sunglasses, Sir Ringo Starr, 78, is quick to unleash his trademark wit, as droll as it was when the Beatles first touched down in the U.S. in 1964.

I\u2019ve been asked to do an autobiography, and they\u2019ve offered me a lot of money, but they\u2019re really only interested in the 8 years from 1962 to 1970.

When we would hang out, we\u2019d have a shot of whiskey, then we\u2019d take pictures of each other. Then another shot and more pictures. We were having fun and I like that attitude for most creative things in life.\n\nThe key to shooting good photos is to: be in the moment. My friend Henry Diltz is a great photographer, but his best shots are casual. He captures you as you are. I like that, rather than scrambling to set up a shot and making sure the lighting\u2019s right.\n\nI\u2019m not a photographer: I\u2019m a guy who takes photos. It\u2019s not a hobby but I\u2019m no pro. It\u2019s part of the things I love to do.\n\nI invented: the craze of taking pictures of food. I really did. I was first. I love Instagram, but I\u2019ve got loads of pictures of plates of food and empty chairs going back to the 1960s and \u201970s. You can tell a whole story from them.\n\nPentax Asahi camera. Photo: Alamy\n\nI miss: real cameras. In the \u201960s, as soon as I could afford one I went for a Pentax. I was the guy who bought the fisheye lens. All the lenses! All the craziness you could put on the front of the camera, I had it.\n\nNow I shoot with: my iPhone. Nobody has a camera anymore.\n\nIf you\u2019re a good musician: you\u2019re probably also a good cook. Because your senses are open and that creativity carries over into every part of life.\n\nI\u2019ve learned: not to be too hard on myself. I\u2019m still a work-in-progress.\n\nAmerican jazz singers Sarah Vaughan and Billy Eckstine circa 1945. Photo: Metronome/Getty Images\n\nMy best childhood memory: is of my stepdad, Harry. He loved big band records but when I was a teen playing my records he never said, \u201cTurn that sh-t off.\u201d He\u2019d say, \u201cHave you heard this?\u201d And then he\u2019d pop on Sarah Vaughan, or he\u2019d play Billy Eckstine.\n\nI recommend: Transcendental Meditation. I\u2019ve done it nearly every day\u2014depending on the time zone, or the plane, or where I\u2019m going\u2014since 1992.\n\nI wish I still had: my lost 8mm movies from the Beatles early tours. But a lot of them were just shots of cows. I come from the city\u2014a downtrodden part of Liverpool\u2014so when we were in the country, I was like, \u201cWow, look at this space!

You don\u2019t have to be a professional.\n\nMy role models are: Buddy Guy and the late B.B. King. All those old blues guys play forever. Now people say, \u201cOh god, you\u2019re still playing!\u201d I\u2019m going to play as long as I can hold those two bits of wood.\n\nMy first love was: country music. I loved the sentiment of it. And the blues, too. How things could\u2019ve been different! I actually tried to emigrate to Houston at 19 because I was inspired by Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins.\n\nZildjian sticks, his \u2019two bits of wood.\u2019 Photo: Zildjian\n\nI\u2019ve tried: to play with several drummers, and their style is just too busy. No one plays the drums quite like me.\n\nI relax by: binge-watching Hulu and Netflix. I\u2019m not a news junkie\u2014that\u2019ll bring you down. But I love bingeing TV.

From the Ebates site, shoppers click through to a retailer to make a purchase. Retailers pay commissions to list on the site, and Ebates gives a percentage back to shoppers, usually between 1% and 10% of the purchase price. Companies beyond retailers have started working with the site, including ride-share company Lyft and food delivery firm DoorDash.\n\nHoney: A browser extension that finds coupons, cash-back offers and tracks prices on a number of retail websites including Amazon.com , Target.com and Walmart.com. Honey offers a feature where shoppers can receive an alert when the price drops on a specific product. Black Friday might not be the best day to buy, said co-founder Ryan Hudson: \u201cDecember 12th or something might be a great day because the retailer is trying to get rid of some product.\u201d A Honey mobile app is on the way, Mr. Hudson said.\n\nDosh: Once shoppers have linked their credit card to the service, they earn cash back whenever they shop in a store or eat at a restaurant that has negotiated a deal with Dosh, which currently includes large retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. , as well as restaurants and gas stations. Earning back up to 10% of the value of the purchase, shoppers can receive a text message when money hits their account.\n\nCamelCamelCamel: This price-tracking website allows shoppers to see the pricing history of most items on Amazon. To see a product\u2019s pricing history and gauge the best time to buy, users can enter a product\u2019s webpage or set up an alert for a price drop. The site also allows shoppers to import their Amazon wish list to track price movements.\n\nIbotta: A mobile app that offers shoppers cash rebates from thousands of brands, travel companies and retailers. Ibotta will offer daily deals Thanksgiving week, with some retailers and brands increasing the commissions they pay Ibotta to fund higher rebates during that period, said an executive.\n\nLolli: If you\u2019ve been wondering how to shop at Walmart.com while earning bitcoin, this browser extension is the answer.

By choosing to wear a plastic G-Shock, the Police frontman was as much ahead of his time as he was in embracing world music and using celebrity as a platform for activism. G-Shocks, a then-little-known line of Casios, anticipated casual, abuse-proof watches to come.\n\nHaving hit stores just a few years prior and far from an immediate hit, the Japanese digital watch represented some of the most advanced horological innovations of its day. G-Shock inventor Kikuo Ibe once said that he destroyed more than 200 prototypes in his pursuit of the \u201cTriple Ten,\u201d which refers to the watches\u2019 ability to survive a 10-meter fall, stay waterproof for 10 bars (a maritime unit of pressure) and boast a 10-year battery life.\n\nAt the star-studded 1986 Sport Aid event, Sudanese champion runner Omar Khalifa was greeted by Margaret Thatcher and Princess Diana. In this image (right) Sting wears a notably low-key navy blue sweater to photograph the action, but his almost aggressively functional Casio stands out. The hardy watch clearly departs from the polished timepieces you\u2019d expect a celebrity to wear in the mid-80s at the height of his fame.\n\nA new-gen G-Shock and rival digital watches.

Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nG-Shock\u2019s reputation as the toughest watch was cemented by the 1994 thriller \u201cSpeed,\u201d in which a Los Angeles police officer (played by Keanu Reeves) disarms bombs, dodges shotgun shells and decapitates a disgruntled psycho while wearing a G-Shock. After military and law enforcement sorts adopted the watch, skaters and streetwear enthusiasts followed suit in the late 1990s, making it a style staple.\n\n\u201cSo much of what streetwear was and is involves reinterpreting classic sportswear and military styles with more of a fashion look,\u201d said Greg Rivera, vice president of the streetwear label Mishka, which is preparing to release a collaboration with G-Shock in 2019. \u201cThe G-Shock is something a soldier would wear, so it makes sense that a street soldier would wear it, too.\u201d\n\nWhile Apple turns its timepieces into high-tech personal assistants and rappers tout traditional timepieces like those from Patek Philippe, digital watches remain a nostalgic style standard. And G-Shocks continue to maintain a fan base among active guys. \u201cIf you surf, skate, climb or dive, the G-Shock will withstand the rigors of your lifestyle much better than almost any connected watch,\u201d said John Cote, an Indianapolis-based director on the board of the National Association of Watch & Clock Collectors. \u201cIn the world of mechanical watches, dive watches like the Rolex Submariner do sort of the same thing, but for a lot more money.\u201d\n\nToday, you\u2019ll find far more G-Shock options than when Sting wore his in 1986, from $50 basic sport watches to colorful collaborations with high-end designers like Martin Margiela and artists like Takashi Murakami. New York menswear designer Robert Geller, who put his own spin on the timepiece, said, of the G-Shock\u2019s timelessness: \u201cIt is just a classic. It reminds me of my teenage years.\u201d\n\nMr. Ibe, the watch\u2019s inventor, insisted there\u2019s no right way to wear a G-Shock: \u201cWear it any way you want as long as it makes you feel confident and happy.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Katie Honan", "title": "Half of Jobs at Amazon's Two New Headquarters Won't Be Tech Positions - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Half of Jobs at Amazon's Two New Headquarters Won't Be Tech Positions Wall Street Journal Initially, Amazon had planned to build one new headquarters with 50,000 employees.

In my own kitchen, her books are among the most dog-eared. So when Ms. Greenspan rethinks a recipe, I take note.\n\nReading her latest cookbook, \u201cEveryday Dorie,\u201d I paused when I came to a recipe for apple custard crisp. From the title, I\u2019d assumed the custard would be poured on top of the crisp. I was wrong.\n\nAs it happened, custard had been on my mind. When I was researching a cookbook of my own in London a few years ago, I found custard on nearly every menu in the city, most often in lieu of the whipped cream that commonly garnishes desserts in the U.S. and the dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ubiquitous in France. A cooked sauce of milk, cream, egg yolks and vanilla, custard is poured onto nearly every warm dessert in the British repertoire, from Christmas pudding to gingerbread. Apple crisp is no exception. While a baker on the left side of the Atlantic might serve this sweet with a scoop of ice cream, in the U.K. it nearly always wears a coat of custard, drawing the whole dessert together in a warm, mellow embrace.\n\nScanning Ms. Greenspan\u2019s recipe, I noted that her crisp not only leans British in calling for custard but goes a step further. No mere garnish, the custard is baked right into the apple base. This way, the crisp topping maintains its defining crispness. And it streamlines the recipe, as the custard cooks along with the dessert.\n\nMs. Greenspan also adds a shot of Calvados or rum to the mix. And, true to her American roots, she finishes the crisp with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, offering an appealing dance of hot and cold in every bite. Who, on either side of the pond, could possibly argue?\n\nApple Custard Crisp\n\nACTIVE TIME: 30 minutes TOTAL TIME: 2\u00bd hours SERVES: 8\n\nFor the crisp topping:\n\n\u00be cup all-purpose flour\n\n3 tablespoons sugar\n\n1 tablespoon brown sugar\n\n\u00bc teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n\u00bc teaspoon fine sea salt\n\n5\u00bd tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed\n\n\u00bd teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nFor the apple-custard base:\n\n1\u00bd pounds Golden Delicious apples\n\nZest and juice of 1 juicy lemon\n\n\u00bd cup heavy cream\n\n\u00bc cup packed brown sugar\n\nPinch of ground cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger or cardamom\n\n1 large egg\n\n1 large egg yolk\n\n1 tablespoon Calvados or dark rum (optional)\n\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n\nVanilla ice-cream, for serving\n\n1. Make the crisp topping: In a bowl, whisk together flour, both sugars, cinnamon and salt. Drop in cubes of cold butter and toss with fingers until butter is coated. Squeeze and rub ingredients together to form moist clumps and curds. Sprinkle with vanilla and toss to blend. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 days.\n\n2. Make the apple-custard base: Preheat oven to 375 degrees and set rack in center position. Place a deep-dish 9-inch pie plate on a baking sheet lined with parchment to catch spills.\n\n3. Peel, halve, core and cut apples into 1\u00bd-inch cubes. Transfer apples to pie plate. Stir in lemon zest and juice.\n\n4. In a medium bowl, whisk together cream, brown sugar, spice, egg and egg yolk to blend thoroughly, about 1 minute. Whisk in Calvados and vanilla. Pour custard over apples and jiggle pie plate to encourage custard to slide into all the spaces.\n\n5. Scatter the apple-custard base with crisp topping and tap topping lightly with your fingers so it sticks.\n\n6. Transfer to oven and bake until crisp is golden brown and apples are tender, 50-60 minutes. If crisp appears to be browning too quickly, tent loosely with foil.\n\n7. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack and let crisp rest at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.\n\n\u2014Adapted from \u201cEveryday Dorie\u201d by Dorie Greenspan (Rux Martin/ Houghton Mifflin Harcourt )"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "The Wall Street Journal", "title": "Amazon pay accepted here?

That may not matter.\n\nTax cuts, a strong economy and, for most retailers, improved operations, drove stocks higher this year. Even with the selloff this week, the S&P Retail Index has beaten the overall market by 17 percentage points.\n\nYet the lesson from the selloff, which knocked down some big retail stocks by as much as 10% this week, is that factors such as rising inventory, tariffs and higher labor costs will drive stock performance through the holidays and into next year.\n\nThe first two issues are connected but investors are clearly struggling to understand the dynamic. Most U.S. companies accelerated imports to beat the 10% tariffs on Chinese-made goods that are already in effect. And many are rushing to beat the 25% tariffs on the same goods that are expected in January.\n\nThe obvious result is higher inventories. But it was only last year that retailers got their inventory problem in check and improved their pricing power. That has boosted them throughout 2018.\n\nSo investors are understandably skittish about higher inventories, worried that retailers will need to slash prices to clear out their warehouses.\n\nThat is likely a mistake. First, the economy is strong so consumers can spend. Second, higher tariffs will mean higher prices, so goods imported before tariffs hit will sell at higher profit margins, offsetting the cost of carrying inventory. Or so the retailers hope.\n\nEven with stepped-up imports, tariffs will still hurt retailers. MoffettNathanson calculates that a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports could cut retail EPS growth in half in 2019.\n\nRetailers\u2019 costs are also rising, particularly wages. Amazon\u2019s recent decision to raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour puts pressure on others, who are struggling to protect their own sales from the e-commerce behemoth. Amazon is on track to seize one-third of U.S. retail growth in 2018.\n\nAnalysts still expect retailers to do well this Christmas. Consumer spending is healthy enough to drive 5% sales growth in the fourth-quarter, and general merchandise retailers will benefit from the demise of Toys R Us and Sears. Target is expected to get the biggest lift from toy sales. Meanwhile, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of Sears\u2019 bankruptcy.\n\nBut the momentum of 2018 may not carry into 2019\u2014or not for everyone. Winning stocks will be those retailers that have pricing power, the ability to manage labor costs, and the ability to battle Amazon. That favors home improvement and loyalty models such as Costco, writes Greg Melich, a retail analyst at MoffettNathanson.\n\nAfter a year of industrywide growth, investors will have to pick judiciously."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Douglas Belkin", "title": "At Penn State, Field Trips Go Virtual", "description": "More universities are adding virtual reality to their courses, allowing students to take field trips to rain forests, dissect cadavers and visit ancient cities.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-penn-state-field-trips-go-virtual-1542796201", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38102/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:36:27Z", "content": "Students at Pennsylvania State University taking introduction to geoscience have for decades piled into a bus and driven 12 miles to study the Bald Eagle sedimentary rock formation.

The deep partnership ranks as the world\u2019s second-biggest car maker behind Volkswagen AG .\n\nMr. Ghosn\u2019s surprise arrest in Japan earlier this week has underscored long-simmering rifts between the two sides of the alliance. Admirers say Mr. Ghosn helped bridge those rifts, while critics say he has exacerbated them.\n\nVideo Analysis: Carlos Ghosn\u2019s Legacy Takes a U-Turn WSJ reporters analyze the impact on his legacy following his arrest over financial misconduct. Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe detention has also drawn in the governments of France and Japan. Nissan is one of the country\u2019s most iconic industrial companies. The French government, meanwhile, is a major Renault shareholder, owning over 15%.\n\nFrench Finance and Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said he would meet his Japanese counterpart Hiroshige Seko in Paris on Thursday to discuss the Renault-Nissan alliance. Mr. Seko spoke to Mr. Le Maire by phone on Tuesday, and the Frenchman told him Paris was seeking information on the allegations and evidence against Mr. Ghosn, according to a French official.\n\nMr. Le Maire held an unusual news conference in Paris Wednesday morning, standing with senior executives at Renault, a day after the car maker appointed an interim chairman and CEO to temporarily take over Mr. Ghosn\u2019s roles there.\n\nMr. Le Maire stopped short of outright defending Mr. Ghosn, but said the government hasn\u2019t yet received evidence backing up allegations against him leveled by Japanese prosecutors or Nissan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a country subject to the rule of law,\u201d said Mr. Le Maire. \u201cWe believe in the presumption of innocence. We don\u2019t have any evidence at this point justifying the accusations brought against Carlos Ghosn.\u201d\n\nMr. Ghosn, one of the auto world\u2019s most prominent executives, was arrested Monday in Tokyo on suspicion of understating compensation in Nissan\u2019s financial reports. Nissan, where he serves as chairman, has also accused him of misstating expenses and misusing company assets. Nissan and fellow alliance member Mitsubishi has said they would move to oust him as their respective chairman later this week.\n\nMr. Ghosn hasn\u2019t been formally charged with any crime. Since his arrest, though, he has been held in a detention center with limited access to the outside world. In Japan, suspects can be held and questioned without the presence of their attorney, though they are allowed to meet with counsel. It couldn\u2019t be determined whether Mr. Ghosn has a lawyer.\n\nFrance\u2019s ambassador to Japan visited Mr. Ghosn, a French citizen, on Tuesday, a French embassy spokesman said. He declined to give details.\n\nAs is typical for detainees undergoing interrogation, Mr. Ghosn is being held at the main Tokyo detention center in the northeastern part of the city. According to the Justice Ministry, a single room at the detention center is about 75 square feet to 85 square feet. Detainees normally wake up at 7 a.m. and go to bed at 9 p.m. They can exercise about 30 minutes a day and take a bath two or three times a week. An official at the detention center said it serves three meals a day consisting of rice\u201470% white rice and 30% barley\u2014and side dishes.\n\nAfter authorities make an arrest in Japan, they can interrogate the suspect for two or three days without court approval. To extend the detention for 10 days, they must seek court approval. They can then seek an additional 10-day extension, after which they must release the suspect unless charges are filed.\n\nWrite to Chieko Tsuneoka at chieko.Tsuneoka@dowjones.com, Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com and Noemie Bisserbe at noemie.bisserbe@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Bradley Hope", "title": "Goldman Sachs Sued Over 'Central Role' in 1MDB Scandal - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Goldman Sachs Sued Over 'Central Role' in 1MDB Scandal Wall Street Journal An Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund accused Goldman Sachs GS 0.66% Group Inc. in a lawsuit Wednesday of playing a \u201ccentral role\u201d in an international corruption scand\u2026", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sovereign-fund-sues-goldman-sachs-over-1mdb-scandal-1542811084", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38267/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:10:00Z", "content": "An Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund accused Goldman Sachs GS 0.66% Group Inc. in a lawsuit Wednesday of playing a central role in an international corruption scandal and enabling bribes to former top executives at the fund.

Those derivatives contracts on average begin protecting top drillers, if oil dips below $56 a barrel, according to energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.\n\nHedging was a drag on profits earlier this year, preventing many companies from fully benefiting from a rise in oil prices during much of 2018. But it could now insulate the companies from a recent plunge that pushed prices for West Texas Intermediate down 6.6% Tuesday to $53.43, the lowest level in more than a year.\n\nShale drillers even stand to wring a little money from the derivatives contracts now that oil is lower than the average hedging price. However, not all of their production is insulated from price swings, and many of those protections expire next year.\n\nWhile current oil prices aren\u2019t low enough for companies to put off fracking wells near-term, sustained lower prices could prompt companies to dial back next year\u2019s capital spending plans.\n\nPrice Protections Many frackers hedged their oil production to insulate themselves from lower prices.

EOG would scale back its production if oil falls below $50 a barrel, Lloyd Helms, Jr., the company\u2019s chief operating officer, said last week at an industry conference.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to maintain our discipline in how we allocate capital,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re building a business that\u2019s going to be sustainable through the commodity price whether the oil price is $40 or $80.\u201d\n\nFrackers generally are more exposed to price volatility next year than they were this year. U.S. drillers have used derivatives contracts to protect about 25% of their output in 2019, compared with 45% this year, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis of the larger companies that hedge their oil and natural gas liquids production.\n\nSome also hedge much more than others. Concho Resources Inc., a company active in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, has among the largest hedging programs, with about two-thirds of next year\u2019s oil and natural-gas liquids output covered, according to Wood Mackenzie.\n\nContinental Resources Inc., an Oklahoma-based company that is among the pioneers of North Dakota\u2019s Bakken Shale formation, doesn\u2019t currently hedge its oil production.\n\nMatthew Portillo, a managing director at energy investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., said sustained cheap oil likely would disproportionately impact drilling plans in places like North Dakota and Canada. Producers there are far from export markets and are already having to sell some of their crude at a discount because of pipeline bottlenecks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very minimal price protection in place,\u201d he said, speaking of the sector as a whole.

He said the new jobs would be focused on enhancing IKEA\u2019s online and delivery offerings as well as the in-store experience.\n\n\u201cSo far as we can recall we haven\u2019t had this before,\u201d he said of the restructuring. \u201cWe do it because we want to secure IKEA for the future.\u201d\n\nMr. \u00d6nc\u00fc said growth in the number of customers visiting its existing stores has stalled, prompting IKEA to change how they look.\n\nThe company\u2019s research has shown that 80% of customers research their planned purchases online before visiting a store. In response, IKEA is cutting the number of products it displays, freeing up space for more mocked up living rooms and bedrooms. Mr. \u00d6nc\u00fc hopes the change will motivate more customers to visit stores.\n\nIKEA plans to open its biggest city-center store to date in Paris in the spring at 5,000 square meters. It also intends to eventually open a city-center store in New York, but this is still at the exploratory stage. If New Yorkers take to the concept, IKEA plans roll out similar stories in cities such as Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco, Mr. \u00d6nc\u00fc said.\n\nFounded in 1943, IKEA initially sold pens, wallets, table runners, watches and nylon stockings. Over the years, it evolved into the world\u2019s largest furniture retailer, selling sleek Scandinavian designs relatively inexpensively and in easy to transport flat packs.\n\nThe company has for decades followed a successful model of opening sprawling, out-of-town stores that act as showrooms, storage depots and restaurants. IKEA opened its first 72,000-square-foot store in 1958 in the Swedish village of \u00c4lmhult, discovering that people were prepared to travel long distances to visit the shop.\n\nMore recently, the company has said that 70% of the world\u2019s population will live in cities by 2050, forcing it to rethink its decades-old strategy. IKEA has tried to make its furniture accessible to more people, opening centrally located stores and click-and-collect sites, improving delivery and rolling out websites in more countries. Last year it bought online marketplace TaskRabbit to make it easier for customers to assemble its shelves, sofas and beds. It has also said it would test selling its furniture on third-party websites.\n\n\u201cWe see of course that the world around us is changing and we want to be part of that,\u201d said Mr. \u00d6nc\u00fc.\n\nLast month, IKEA reported its retail sales for the financial year of \u20ac34.8 billion ($39.69 billion), up just slightly from the \u20ac34.1 billion it reported the prior year.\n\nWrite to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "WSJ Staff", "title": "WSJ Wealth Adviser Briefing: Comp Push-Back, Energy Losses, Expensive Kitchens", "description": "Some brokers at Merrill Lynch are pushing back against a compensation plan, energy losses prompt an emotional video to options firm\u2019s clients, and inside the kitchens of America's most expensive homes.", "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/11/21/wsj-wealth-adviser-briefing-comp-push-back-energy-losses-expensive-kitchens/", "urlToImage": "https://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:00:20Z", "content": "Some brokers at Merrill Lynch are pushing back against a compensation plan they claim rewards them for increasing debt their clients take on and in some cases can punish them for reducing it.

But markets tumbled Tuesday, wiping out yearly gains for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. Just some jitters or do investors know something we don't?\n\nGood morning. Jeff Sparshott here to take you through the day's top economic news. We have Greg Ip's exclusive interview with investor Stan Druckenmiller, look at pressure on the Fed to stop raising rates, and check in on economic growth. There's also the latest White House accusations against China and some good news for multimillionaires.\n\nTHAT SINKING FEELING\n\nThe U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders\u2014job growth is strong, wages are climbing, factories are humming and inflation is on target. Yet stocks are sinking, yields on corporate bonds are rising and commodity prices are tumbling, all typical precursors of a slowdown or recession. The causes: Growth outside the U.S. is deteriorating and the Federal Reserve is steadily withdrawing the unprecedented monetary stimulus that buoyed the economy and almost every asset class over the last decade.\n\nThe question is whether markets, in adjusting to these new realities, will overreact to the point that they endanger the expansion, on track to become the longest ever next summer. The answer for now appears to be no, but the trends are troubling, Greg Ip writes.\n\nHEDGE FUND LEGEND IS WORRIED\n\nStan Druckenmiller is a legend among hedge fund managers, as lieutenant to George Soros and head of his own firm. The market has him worried. \"The defensive stocks have been going straight up since May. All the economically sensitive stocks have been going down since May. They\u2019re predicting we\u2019re in a very, very late cycle,\" he said Tuesday. The signs are the \"same stuff I screamed about in 2007.\" He's not saying the Fed shouldn't tighten, ever; but it should wait, and \"see what happens.\" The time to tighten was a few years ago; now, it's more dangerous: \"The leveraged loan market is two times what it was in 2007.\" He pins the blame on the Fed's quantitative easing which \"encouraged more malinvestment...than at any time I can ever remember. We\u2019re in the most economically disruptive period since the 1880s and there\u2019s been no bankruptcies. As quantitative easing turns to quantitative tightening, all these zombies are going to be exposed.\"\u2014Greg Ip\n\nWHAT TO WATCH TODAY\n\nU.S. durable goods orders for October, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, are expected to fall 2.6% from the prior month.\n\nU.S. jobless claims, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, are expected to inch down to 214,000.\n\nU.S. existing-home sales for October, out at 10 a.m. ET, are expected to rise to an annual pace of 5.19 million.\n\nThe University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for November, out at 10 a.m. ET, is expected to register at 98.2, little changed from its preliminary reading.\n\nThe Conference Board's leading economic index for October, out at 10 a.m. ET, is expected to be unchanged.\n\nJapan's consumer-price index for October is out at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nSTEADY AS SHE GOES, MR. POWELL\n\nPresident Trump and some investors are calling on the Fed to halt its campaign of interest rate increases, but the selloff in stocks and corporate bonds is unlikely to stop the central bank from raising rates when it meets again next month. Fed officials have signaled in recent days they plan to proceed with another quarter percentage point increase in their benchmark short-term interest rate when they meet Dec. 19, marking their fourth rate increase this year. The market pullback does underscore the uncertain outlook for what the Fed will do after that, Nick Timiraos and Gregory Zuckerman report.\n\nUnder pressure: \"I'd like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate. I think the rate is too high. I think we have much more of a Fed problem than we have a problem with anyone else,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.\n\nSHADOW OF A DOUBT\n\nThe Federal Reserve has flagged that it plans to raise short-term interest rates three times next year. Bond traders are increasingly skeptical that it will. A market-based measure of interest-rate expectations for 2019 fell to its lowest level in months. Federal-funds futures showed the market pricing in a 10% chance of the Fed raising rates at least three times next year. That\u2019s down from 21% a week ago and 28% a month ago, Akane Otani reports.\n\nIT'S THE ECONOMY, SMARTY PANTS\n\nOne reason markets may worry that growth is fading: Growth is fading. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is tracking a 2.5% annualized rate of growth in the fourth quarter, respectable but well short of 3.5% in the third quarter and 4.2% in the second. J.P. Morgan is forecasting 1.9% for all of 2019, an all-too-familiar pace for the current expansion. The triple whammy: \"Monetary, fiscal and trade policies all are turning somewhat less friendly for growth next year,\" J.P. Morgan economists write. In other words, interest rates are rising, the boost from tax cuts is fading and tariffs are acting like a tax increase.\n\nCENTRAL PLANNING\n\nCentral banks are out of ammo. So it's up to governments to prepare spending plans they can roll out quickly and in concert should the global economy slow sharply, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said. The OECD still expects the global economy to experience a soft landing over the coming years, but warned Wednesday of a growing risk that higher barriers to trade, capital outflows from developing economies, and higher oil prices could push it off track, Paul Hannon reports.\n\nCentral banks did most of the heavy lifting during the last recession. But interest rates are already negative across much of Europe and Japan while central banks\u2019 balance sheets have been swollen by purchases of government bonds and other securities. Fiscal policy would likely have to come to the rescue.\n\nUNFAIR AND UNREASONABLE\n\nLess than two weeks ahead of a China-U.S. summit, the U.S. Trade Representative accused Beijing of failing to change economic policies that threaten U.S. industry. \u201cChina has not fundamentally altered its unfair, unreasonable and market-distorting practices,\u201d U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said.\n\nThe trade representative\u2019s office Tuesday released a 50-page report on Chinese trade practices, an update on a March study that alleged Beijing used various techniques to coerce U.S. firms to hand over leading-edge technology. The Trump administration has used the March report as the basis for levying tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, about half of what Beijing sends to the U.S. annually, Bob Davis reports. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in Buenos Aires around Dec. 1.\n\nSKIP THIS ONE UNLESS YOU'RE RICH\n\nMultimillionaires would get more flexibility to make tax-free gifts to their heirs under a Trump administration proposal released late Tuesday. Under the regulation, people would have an easier time taking advantage of the temporary increase in the gift- and estate-tax exclusion that Congress passed last year. Before Tuesday\u2019s proposal, some tax lawyers worried that making significant tax-free gifts now could cause an estate-tax bill for some people dying after the changes expire at the end of 2025. Once the regulation becomes final, it is likely to spur a wave of wealth transfers from people worth more than $5 million to their children, Richard Rubin and Laura Saunders report.\n\nQUOTES OF THE DAY\n\n\"I mean, I'm reading some of the weirdest stuff, how a recession is around the corner. Nonsense. My personal view, our administration's view, recession is so far in the distance I can't see it.\"\u2014White House Economic Adviser Lawrence Kudlow on Tuesday\n\n\"You can call it Goldilocks 2.0. But you can\u2019t call it a recession.\"\u2014Mr. Kudlow in December 2007\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY\n\nThe stock market outperformed the economy in recent years. It wasn't a sign things were secretly better than we knew.\n\nNow that the stock market is sliding, count me skeptical that it's a sign of hidden weakness in the domestic economy. \u2014 Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) November 21, 2018\n\nWHAT ELSE WE'RE READING: BLACK FRIDAY EDITION\n\nGift-giving can be a bit of an economic drag. \"In many developing countries, gift expenses escalate with income growth and account for a substantial share of household expenditure. We develop a theoretical model to demonstrate how (unequal) income growth may trigger \u2018gift competition\u2019 and drive up the financial burden associated with gift exchange,\" Erwin Bultea, Ruixin Wang and Xiaobo Zhang write in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization. The results include potential adverse welfare effects and crowding out of spending on other items.\n\nFor charities, Christmas can\u2019t come too soon. \"First, the month of December is associated with a 14% increase in the probability to make a donation, thereby providing strong support to the notion of seasonal altruism. Second, exploiting a reform that changed the price of giving, I find that this December effect is equivalent to a 32% discount on charitable giving. Finally, half of the December increase in generosity persists into January before returning to the baseline in February,\" Mathias Ekstr\u00f6m writes in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Asa Fitch", "title": "Interpol Defies Russia to Elect South Korean as President - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Interpol Defies Russia to Elect South Korean as President Wall Street Journal DUBAI\u2014Interpol elected a South Korean police official as its president Wednesday, rejecting a Russian general whose candidacy had drawn strong opposition from We\u2026", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korean-official-beats-russian-rival-to-become-interpol-president-1542786257", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38242/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T07:44:51Z", "content": "DUBAIInterpol elected a South Korean police official as its president Wednesday, rejecting a Russian general whose candidacy had drawn strong opposition from Western politicians and rights groups.

Ronald Reagan especially pursued a hard-line, often controversial, foreign policy against Soviet Communism, but he did so with a balance of unblinkered realism and American idealism. Mr. Trump seems incapable of such balance.\n\nIt is startling to see a U.S. President brag in a statement about a bloodthirsty murder that, in his \u201cheavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia\u201d last year, he did $450 billion in commercial deals, including $110 billion to benefit Boeing , Lockheed Martin , Raytheon and \u201cmany other great defense contractors.\u201d From Mr. Trump\u2019s point of view, U.S. interests in the Middle East can be reduced to arms deals, oil and Iran. That is crass; no other word suffices.\n\nWe don\u2019t mean to join the critics who through moralizing glasses seem to be suggesting that the U.S. has no choice other than to sever its relationship with Saudi Arabia over this murder. That wouldn\u2019t cause the Saudis to change their behavior or serve U.S. interests. The Saudis, as Mr. Trump asserted, are important allies in a still-dangerous war against Middle Eastern terror fomented and supported by the mullahs in Iran.\n\nBut Crown Prince Salman\u2019s misjudgments have sometimes made protecting U.S. interests in the Middle East more difficult. He has shown himself to be reckless in his prosecution of the war in Yemen and willful in his dispute with Qatar. Even if he did not sanction Khashoggi\u2019s murder, it\u2019s clear he was aware that the journalist would be kidnapped and brought back to the Kingdom.\n\nThat too is bad judgment that should raise doubts about the Crown Prince\u2019s reliability and effectiveness as an ally. The risk is that Mr. Trump\u2019s public reduction of the relationship to crass interests is that the Crown Prince will feel he can do anything and suffer no diminution of U.S. support. We hope Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton are delivering a much tougher message in private.\n\nLike any President, Mr. Trump also needs domestic allies in pursuit of a foreign policy that sometimes requires hard choices. Instead, Mr. Trump\u2019s statement isolates him from his natural supporters on Mideast policy, such as Senator Lindsey Graham or Senator-elect Mitt Romney, who both separated themselves Tuesday from the President\u2019s position.\n\nThe reality is that few members of Congress will align themselves with a statement bereft of asserting America\u2019s abhorrence for the murder of political opponents. Without political or public support, Mr. Trump diminishes the odds that his Middle East strategy will succeed."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "The Editorial Board", "title": "The Trade Canary", "description": "The 2018 decline in the rate of growth in trade volume is a warning to the White House.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trade-canary-1542758721", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38181/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:27:32Z", "content": "With another 2% or so decline on Tuesday, U.S. stock indices have given up their gains for the year.

The rout that started in tech stocks has moved to oil shares amid worries about global demand, as well as to retail stocks, which suggests concern about whether consumers will continue their pace of spending as asset prices fall.\n\nIt\u2019s a legitimate worry. The job market has been strong, and small business confidence remains high, but those tend to be lagging indicators. With the world economy showing strains, the chances of a significant U.S. growth slowdown can no longer be ruled out. We\u2019d note that our contributor Donald Luskin, the financial adviser and long-time growth optimist, has put himself on recession watch.\n\nPotomac Watch Podcast\n\nAnother reason to worry is the nearby chart, which tracks the quarterly change in world trade volume from 2015 through mid-2018. Note the sharp decline in the rate of growth in global trade in the first half of 2018.\n\nTrade flows aren\u2019t a perfect proxy for GDP, but trade in an expanding economy tends to increase at a faster pace than overall growth. The average annual increase from 1987-2007 was 7.1%. Trade volume naturally fell during the recession but rebounded to 12% growth in 2010. But it stagnated at 3% from 2012-2014, and then went below 2% in 2015 when the economy barely escaped another recession.\n\nTrade flows revived along with growth in 2017, but they fell again this year as Donald Trump unveiled his global tariff assault after tax reform passed. The World Trade Organization hasn\u2019t yet reported third quarter trade data, but a fair guess would be continuing doldrums, as global growth has slowed and the threat of more tariffs hangs over supply chains, investment decisions and confidence.\n\nWe hope someone at the White House is listening to this trade canary. Mr. Trump is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month at the G-20 meeting, and the world will be watching to see if they strike a trade truce. The chances of a deal have seemed slim, but the logic of a truce grows stronger as the stock market falls further."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "The Editorial Board", "title": "Reviving Due Process on Campus", "description": "DeVos restores the right to cross-examination.

No other conclusion is possible after seeing the reaction to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019s long-awaited regulatory proposals last week on handling accusations of sexual abuse on campus.\n\nFrom California Democrat Maxine Waters: \u201cBetsy DeVos, you won\u2019t get away with what you are doing. We are organizing to put an end to your destruction of civil rights protections for students.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said on Facebook that the proposal \u201cwould return us to the days when schools swept rape and assault under the rug and survivors were shamed into silence.\u201d\n\nThe centerpiece of the proposed regulations is\u2014hold your fire\u2014restoring the right of cross-examination, one of the oldest and most hallowed elements of due process.\n\nThe Obama Department of Education, responding to legitimate concerns about sexual abuse on campus, issued guidelines that went overboard, casting away many basic protections for the accused. The result has subjected victims and the accused to a system of campus justice often controlled by amateurs and political activists.\n\nFor more than four decades the Department of Education has set Title IX policy by issuing \u201cguidance,\u201d which circumvents the normal rule-making process. The Obama-era sexual abuse guidance was essentially an administrative diktat. The public had no chance to comment, and universities, which understood federal funding was at risk, opted to dilute standard legal protections for accused students.\n\nSecretary DeVos has instead followed normal rule-making to create a balance between protecting victims and the rights of the accused. The proposals include \u201cthe right of every survivor to be taken seriously and the right of every person accused to know that guilt is not predetermined.\u201d Both the alleged victim and the accused would be able to inspect and review all evidence.\n\nAll Title IX hearings would include cross-examination, which could occur in-person or by live stream, with campus adjudicators allowed to observe the demeanor of witnesses as they assess credibility. The statements of anyone who refuses cross-examination could not be considered in the final determination. Title IX judges would be required to consider both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.\n\nThe proposed rule acknowledges how schools\u2019 \u201ctreatment of both complainant and respondent could constitute discrimination on the basis of sex.\u201d Both the alleged victim and the accused would enjoy the same opportunities for appeal, and, if both parties agreed, administrators could offer informal resolution processes like mediation.\n\nOne troubling aspect remains. Universities could still use a weaker \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d as the standard of proof, similar to civil cases, rather than a higher \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard. Ms. DeVos mitigates this somewhat by barring universities from using this lower standard for only sexual assault or harassment if they rely on a higher standard for comparable disciplinary cases.\n\nThis is an attempt at compromise, but Mrs. DeVos will get no credit from the Democratic Party\u2019s identity-politics police. Their standard now is essentially that the accused must prove his innocence no matter the lack of evidence against him, as we learned during the Senate\u2019s Brett Kavanaugh crucible.\n\nThe proposed protections are nonetheless progress, and would go a long way to restore basic norms of fairness and justice to campus courts."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Tony Perrottet", "title": "A Weirdly Fascinating Cold-War Tour of Havana", "description": "For travelers hooked on Cold War intrigue, following the trail in the Cuban capital is bizarrely pleasant\u2014from moody museums to a Soviet-themed bo\u00eete.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-weirdly-fascinating-cold-war-tour-of-havana-1542744003", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CL127_CUBA_SOC_20181120142922.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:13:13Z", "content": "NOT A BAD VIEW for a bunker, said a young American traveler named Andria as we peered through a grim, concrete gun-slot at the blue waters of the Straits of Florida.

The underground chamber, Fidel Castro\u2019s headquarters during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, was dug beneath the gardens of the Hotel Nacional. The grande dame of Havana hotels, the property occupies the most commanding headland in the city. To either side of our million-dollar view stretched the arc of the Malec\u00f3n, Havana\u2019s waterfront boulevard, poetically crumbling beneath a wash of sea spray.\n\nThe hotel was a seductive spot to start exploring the residue of the Cold War, memories of which are fresher in Havana than in the rest of the world. I had just finished researching a book about the guerrilla uprising of the late 1950s, when Fidel, Che and their barbudos, \u201cbearded ones,\u201d forced the dictator Fulgencio Batista to flee on New Year\u2019s Day in 1959, nearly 60 years ago. Now I wanted to understand the aftermath, when the idealism of the revolution descended into near-Armageddon with the Soviets and decades of U.S.-Cuban enmity.\n\nA hotel guide leads through the Cuban Missile Crisis-era trenches in front of Havana\u2019s Hotel Nacional. Photo: ROSE MARIE CROMWELL FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nThe bunker and its unlikely setting were my first indication that it was going to be bizarrely pleasant to follow the Cold War trail in Havana. The Hotel Nacional\u2019s elegant outdoor bar, patrolled by emerald peacocks, evoked the romantic 1950s. It\u2019s easy to imagine Ava Gardner and Errol Flynn just finishing their frozen daiquiris while American mob boss Meyer Lansky huddled over a card game by the potted palms. And yet, at the end of the manicured lawn, steps lead abruptly down into the austere post-revolutionary world, with reinforced trenches and gun emplacements. The hotel seems in no hurry to pave over the relics of the Cold War heyday. As he led us through Fidel\u2019s subterranean command post, the bunker\u2019s elderly attendant, Eduardo, a retired hotel bellboy who works for tips, pointed out the olive-drab military binoculars on a tripod pointing due north. \u201cThat way, Miami Beach!\u201d he rejoiced.\n\nTo most of us, the Missile Crisis\u2014which pushed the world the closest it has ever come to nuclear war\u2014is ancient history. Not in Havana. The clammy gray walls of the bunker are still hung with military maps and aerial photos of Soviet missile silos faded from decades of salt air. Tickled to meet two Yanqui travelers, Eduardo opened a rusty grille and led us into a maze of dark tunnels, where flickering lightbulbs revealed old Cuban uniforms and a shards of the American U-2 spy plane shot down during the standoff. The tunnels extend for 800 yards under the strategic hotel, Eduardo said proudly, to shelter the Cuban volunteers who intended to fight to the death against a U.S. Marine assault.\n\n\u201c \u2018Flickering lightbulbs revealed shards of an American U-2 spy plane.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTo get a broader view of the Cold War saga, I headed for the Museum of the Revolution on the edge of the colonial Old Town. It\u2019s hard to miss, now occupying the dictator Batista\u2019s old Presidential Palace, a fairy-tale Neo-Classical confection with stained glass by Tiffany and a reception room based on the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles. Outdoors, the most renowned display is the Granma, the yacht Fidel and his 81 followers used to crash-land on the Cuban coast in 1956 and start their shoestring rebellion. Their against-all-odds success in 1959 bathed the guerrillas in a romantic aura\u2014U.S. newsmen compared Fidel to Robin Hood and Simon Bol\u00edvar\u2014but the artifacts scattered around the Granma show the violent fallout. Among them: the surface-to-air missiles from the CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, and at the museum\u2019s entrance, the tank Fidel commanded to repel the landing.\n\nAfter the Bay of Pigs, Cuba\u2019s course was set as an outpost of the Eastern Bloc in the Caribbean. Vestiges of the Communist influence, when Moscow subsidized Cuba\u2019s sugar industry and propped up the economy, remain on Havana\u2019s horizons, including monolithic Bucharest-style apartment blocks, entirely unsuited for the tropical climate, and the brutalist former U.S.S.R. Embassy, designed to look like the hilt of a sword plunged into the earth. Wandering the alleys of Old Havana, I could still find faded graffiti with Bolshevik stars, hammers and sickles that nobody has bothered to erase. The good times, of course, did not last. The Soviet collapse in 1989 soon turned off aid like a tap, but official hostility with the U.S. did not ease, trapping Cuba in growing isolation.\n\nChip off the Old Eastern Bloc The remnants of the Cold War in Havana The office of the former Cuban president Fulgencio Batista at Havana\u2019s Presidential Palace, now the Museum of the Revolution.

ROSE MARIE CROMWELL FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nTo witness the freshest example of anti-Americanism, I hopped a taxi to another government-run museum called the Memorial de la Denuncia, the Denouncement Memorial. Even that made an oddly charming excursion: It was housed in a finely restored mansion in the leafy, upscale neighborhood of Miramar. The museum opened last year on Aug. 13, which would have been Fidel\u2019s 91st birthday (he died in late 2016, age 90). Perhaps coincidentally, perhaps not, U.S.-Cuban relations were then sliding into a 21st century low after mysterious accusations of \u201csonic attacks\u201d on U.S. diplomats in Havana; soon after, President Trump slowed the Obama-era thaw of 2015-16.\n\nA wall sculpture in the Denouncement Memorial, a new museum in Havana, Cuba. Photo: ROSE MARIE CROMWELL FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nInside the museum\u2019s \u201cCIA Room,\u201d interactive computers recount decades worth of covert U.S. operations alongside panels filled with dense historical documents. Inscribed on one wall was \u201c637\u201d\u2014the number of attempts on Fidel\u2019s life according to the Cuban government. Elsewhere, a projector showed gory silent footage of the 1960 La Coubre disaster, when two explosions destroyed a French freighter in Havana Harbor, killing some 100 dock workers and rescuers. (Fidel charged that the U.S. was behind the disaster, although its cause remains a mystery.) One glass case held rusty ammunition, another displayed bloodstained shirts like conceptual art objects. Two walls were covered with sculpted faces of ghostly, anonymous men\u2014spies and counterintelligence agents, the attendant explained. (Nobody at the museum seemingly took any of the CIA plots personally: As everywhere in Havana, the staff were delighted to meet a New Yorker.)\n\nIn the Memorial\u2019s boxy library, containing its \u201cMarxist-Leninist Collection,\u201d I encountered a librarian in her 20s with nose piercings, dyed pink hair and a jumpsuit with a guerrilla motif. When I asked her how many visitors she\u2019d had that day, she looked at me as if it were an absurd question: \u201cNone!\u201d She, like other young Cubans, seemed to have forgotten old scores and was trying to move on. After all, the revolutionary dream has long faded. In 2011, the first halting steps to dismantling the Socialist system began, though the U.S. trade embargo imposed in the early 1960s remains largely in place.\n\nOn my last night I went to Nazdarovie, a Russian restaurant whose name means \u201cTo Your Health!\u201d Located up a narrow staircase off the Malec\u00f3n, its walls were covered with ironic Soviet posters, and the menu offered borscht, dumplings and blinis. The restaurant\u2019s outdoor balcony has one of the best sunset vistas in the city, so I ordered a vodka shot with caviar and took a table. As the sun bathed the Gulf of Florida in golden light, I raised a glass to Cuba\u2019s future, hoping that the island nation would maybe\u2014one day\u2014untangle from its past. The view, I thought, was even better than from Fidel\u2019s bunker.\n\nBLINI SPOT The interior at Havana\u2019s Russian Nazdarovie restaurant.

NSANY -0.88% , whose chairman is Mr. Ghosn, and whether it was properly disclosed in financial filings, according to a person familiar with the matter. Nissan, meanwhile, informed the board of Renault SA, where Mr. Ghosn serves as both chairman and chief executive, that it had evidence of potential wrongdoing at a Dutch-based joint venture between the two auto makers, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nLate Tuesday, Renault said it had named a deputy CEO and interim chairman to temporarily take over Mr. Ghosn\u2019s responsibilities at the French auto maker. Renault said it was seeking evidence from Nissan of the financial misconduct it and Japanese prosecutors allege against Mr. Ghosn.\n\nThe 64-year-old businessman was arrested in Japan earlier this week after Nissan told authorities that an internal probe found that the executive\u2019s income allegedly had been underreported in the company\u2019s financial statements.\n\nRepresentatives and family members of Mr. Ghosn weren\u2019t available to comment.\n\nNissan shares fell nearly 5.5% on Tuesday, their first day of trading since news of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest. Renault shares have shed almost 10% in the two trading sessions following the arrest.\n\nMr. Ghosn, who forged the alliance as a top Renault executive and later as leader of both auto makers, is credited with turning it into a successful partnership, a rarity in the auto industry. He recently stepped down as chief executive of Nissan; in addition to his roles at Nissan and Renault, he is chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. , another alliance member. He is also chairman and chief executive of the Dutch venture, which serves as a corporate bridge for the nearly two-decade operational alliance\u2014and is now part of Nissan\u2019s internal probe.\n\nMr. Ghosn\u2019s role has been a source of growing tension as executives at Nissan and Renault look toward the future, including the long-speculated possibility of a full-blown merger. The Wall Street Journal reported in May that executives on both sides were informally exploring such a combination. Nissan\u2019s senior Japanese leadership has strongly opposed the idea. Mr. Ghosn has publicly said a merger isn\u2019t the best option, though people familiar with the matter told the Journal that privately he was more open to a deal.\n\nOn Monday, Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa sent a message about the findings regarding the Dutch entity to Renault\u2019s lead independent director, Philippe Lagayette, the people familiar with the matter said. It wasn\u2019t clear exactly what Nissan communicated about its findings.\n\nThat entity, Renault-Nissan BV, jointly owned by Renault and Nissan, doesn\u2019t make cars, but instead is intended to coordinate the broad partnership between the two companies. Its board consists of executives from both companies, according to Dutch corporate filings.\n\nThe unit owns subsidiaries responsible for such activities as joint purchasing and information-technology services.\n\nIts expenses, which totaled more than \u20ac150 million ($171 million) in 2016, include management fees for executives, services provided to alliance partners and payments to outside consultants, according to the Dutch filings.\n\nGreg Kelly, a Nissan director who was arrested in Japan along with Mr. Ghosn, is also lead director of a separate financial-holding company based in the Netherlands, according to Dutch corporate filings. The company was formed as a subsidiary of another Nissan unit in 2010, according to filings. It was intended for investing in startup companies but was largely dormant for years, said one person familiar with the matter.\n\nAfter arresting Mr. Ghosn on Monday, Japanese prosecutors said that he was suspected of understating his income, resulting in Nissan\u2019s issuing inaccurate financial reports in the five fiscal years ending March 2015.\n\nProsecutors said they believed Mr. Ghosn received just shy of \u00a510 billion ($89 million) in income over those years, but the income reported by Nissan to the Tokyo Stock Exchange totaled about \u00a55 billion.\n\nDuring those years, Nissan reported that several of its executives received share-appreciation rights, a form of compensation similar to stock options that rewards executives when the company stock price rises above a certain level. However, Nissan reports showed Mr. Ghosn didn\u2019t receive any share-appreciation rights.\n\nProsecutors believe that Mr. Ghosn, in fact, did receive such income and that Nissan failed to report it, according to the person briefed on the investigation. Such a move, if borne out, would account for a chunk of the income prosecutors allege wasn\u2019t reported.\n\nEven if those suspicions prove accurate, it remains unclear how the income came to be underreported in Nissan\u2019s financial filings, or why accountants didn\u2019t flag the discrepancy. Nissan has said a whistleblower triggered its internal probe, and that it shared its findings with the authorities.\n\nNissan also accused Mr. Ghosn of improperly filing expenses and using company assets for his private use. The alleged improprieties occurred over many years, Nissan said.\n\nMr. Ghosn, who holds French citizenship, hasn\u2019t been formally charged with any crime. But if he is treated like a typical Japanese detainee, the auto executive is likely to spend the next few weeks in a small cell in Tokyo and undergo daily interrogation by prosecutors without a lawyer present.\n\nProsecutors must decide this week whether to hold him for up to an additional 20 days. Such a request is typically granted. During that period, the suspect isn\u2019t entitled to bail.\n\nAfter a meeting late Tuesday, Renault\u2019s board said it had appointed the firm\u2019s No. 2 executive, Thierry Bollor\u00e9, to serve as deputy CEO on a temporary basis and Philippe Lagayette, Renault\u2019s lead independent director, to act as interim chairman.\n\nBy deputizing Mr. Bollor\u00e9, Renault\u2019s board empowered him to wield Mr. Ghosn\u2019s voting rights on the board of Renault-Nissan BV, according to people familiar with the matter. That move is crucial, the people said, because it preserves the balance of power that Renault and Nissan share in the joint venture.\n\nIn a memo posted to the company\u2019s intranet late Monday, Mr. Bollor\u00e9, who is currently chief operating officer, expressed his \u201cfull support\u201d for his boss, but also said the company\u2019s \u201cgovernance bodies are playing their full role in defending Groupe Renault\u2019s corporate interest.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sam Schechner in Paris and Phred Dvorak in Tokyo contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com and Peter Landers at peter.landers@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Khadeeja Safdar", "title": "Gap Looking to Close Hundreds of Weaker Stores", "description": "Gap Inc. said it is exploring whether to close hundreds of underperforming stores at its namesake brand, after the unit reported a 7% decline in quarterly comparable sales.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gap-looking-to-close-hundreds-of-weaker-stores-1542758345", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38217/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:02:47Z", "content": "Gap Inc.

These days the global police agency has too often become a weapon that dictators use against political critics. On Wednesday in Dubai delegates from Interpol\u2014the International Criminal Police Organization\u2014are expected to ratify this descent by choosing an agent of Vladimir Putin as its new president.\n\nThe man is Alexander Prokopchuk, a Russian police general who has worked at the Kremlin\u2019s Interior Ministry and is now chief of Interpol\u2019s National Central Bureau in Russia. This makes him one of Mr. Putin\u2019s enforcers, and putting him in charge of Interpol would give him new authority to do the bidding of dictators around the world.\n\nInterpol is an international association that helps nations track down criminals and terrorists who are beyond their borders. It issues \u201cred notices\u201d so culprits can be arrested and detained overseas pending extradition. In recent years authoritarian nations have manipulated red notices and \u201cdiffusions\u201d (a lower form of alert) to harass businessmen, journalists and others who criticize their regimes.\n\nNo one has done this more than Mr. Putin. Even as delegates from the 194 Interpol nations were preparing to vote for a new president, Russian prosecutors this week announced new charges against Bill Browder. Mr. Browder is the American-born businessman who has earned Mr. Putin\u2019s wrath for urging the U.S. Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act.\n\nThat law allows the U.S. to sanction human-rights offenders overseas by freezing their financial assets and banning them from travel to the U.S. It is named for Russian tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky, an associate of Mr. Browder who died in prison in 2009 after finding evidence of tax fraud by Russian officials. Interpol has issued red notices and diffusions for Mr. Browder, and Russian prosecutors now claim he is part of a \u201ctransnational criminal group\u201d and probably killed Mr. Magnitsky himself.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used Interpol in August to issue a red notice against Dogan Akhanli, a German writer of Turkish origin and a critic of Mr. Erdogan. Spanish authorities detained Mr. Akhanli until a Spanish court ordered his conditional release, prompting German Chancellor Angela Merkel to warn Turkey not to \u201cmisuse\u201d Interpol.\n\nThere\u2019s a vacancy at the top of Interpol because its former president is Meng Hongwei, a former Chinese public-security official who went missing in September while visiting China. Beijing has since accused him of bribery. Mr. Meng\u2019s wife says the charges are untrue and politically motivated, but his fate shows the folly of putting someone answerable to an authoritarian regime in charge of a law-enforcement agency.\n\nInterpol notices aren\u2019t international arrest warrants, so each nation can decide which to act on or ignore. But Mr. Prokopchuk\u2019s ascension raises the question of whether the world\u2019s democracies should work with Interpol at all. On Monday a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators issued a joint statement saying that electing Mr. Prokopchuk would be \u201cputting a fox in charge of a henhouse.\u201d That\u2019s unfair to foxes."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "The Editorial Board", "title": "Pass the Cronyberry Sauce", "description": "Millions of pounds of fruit will be destroyed to prop up prices.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pass-the-cronyberry-sauce-1542759031", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38205/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:19:12Z", "content": "As you dip into the Thanksgiving cranberry sauce, heres a tart story that may make you want to drain the bog.

This fall the U.S. Agriculture Department gave cranberry growers its approval to dump a quarter of their 2018 crop. Tons of fruit and juice\u2014in the ballpark of 100 million pounds\u2014will be turned into compost, used as animal feed, donated or otherwise discarded.\n\nThe goal is to prop up prices. Cranberries are in surplus, with millions of pounds already in storage. President Trump\u2019s trade war hasn\u2019t helped. About a third of production usually goes overseas. But in June the European Union put a 25% tariff on U.S. cranberry-juice concentrate in retaliation for U.S. steel tariffs. A month later, China bumped its tariff on dried cranberries to 40% from 15%. Mexico and Canada also added duties.\n\nAs a negotiating strategy against Mr. Trump, this makes sense: The top cranberry-producing state is Wisconsin, which voted for Mr. Trump and elected Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nThe root of the problem is flat demand and rising supply, which has pushed prices to break-even or below. Normally in such a situation, losses would induce some growers to find another line of work. Instead the Cranberry Marketing Committee, which represents the industry, asked the USDA for what is termed \u201cvolume regulation.\u201d In most businesses, colluding to restrict supply is illegal, but farmers enjoy carve-outs to antitrust law.\n\nLast season the USDA blocked 15% of cranberries from being sold. At the same time, the industry suggested a 25% diversion for this year. The theory was that acting early, before the 2018 season began, would at least give farmers a chance to cut production. But Washington, ever helpful, didn\u2019t provide its go-ahead until this September, by which point the harvest was nearly on. Now fruit and juice\u2014along with hard work\u2014will be going down the drain.\n\nThe USDA rule caps growers\u2019 production based on their historical output, with some exemptions. Small cranberry processors aren\u2019t covered, and neither are those that don\u2019t have inventory left over from last year. The trouble is that this reduces everyone\u2019s incentive to downsize in hopes that cranberry prices eventually get popping again. So the glut may go on, while the industry tries to juice demand with overseas trade missions and creative recipes. \u201cCranzy Chicken Taco,\u201d anyone?\n\nAmong the many economic perversities of agricultural policy, this is merely a vignette. Still, America is growing 100 million pounds of cranberries and then throwing them away to raise prices per government order. Wouldn\u2019t it be better\u2014and easier\u2014to let the market work?"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Dan Frosch", "title": "A Blue Wave Wiped Out Republicans in the Largest County in Texas", "description": "Energized Democrats couldn\u2019t beat Sen.

Whether sailing into the Chesapeake Bay in the early 17th century, waiting in line at Ellis Island in the early 20th, or crossing the South Texas border in the early 21st, immigrants to the U.S. have had to bid farewell to the familiar and enter a strange land with strange customs and, often, a strange language. That took\u2014and still takes\u2014courage and tolerance for risk, traits that are very much part of the American gene pool.\n\nSometimes the risk was to one\u2019s life. About 25% of immigrants to Virginia in the 1620s died within a year. In the late 19th century, about 1 in 7 didn\u2019t survive the trans-Atlantic voyage. Crossing the border illegally remains dangerous.\n\nThe first wave of immigration to the U.S. came between 1620, when the Mayflower arrived in Plymouth, Mass., and 1642, when the English Civil War began. About 25,000 Puritans, seeking to worship God in their own way, traveled to New England during those decades. The war brought the Puritan migration to a close, but other religious and ethnic groups, such as the Quakers and Huguenots, took up the slack in the late 17th century.\n\nThe Dutch came to New Amsterdam in the early 1600s to trade fur, tolerating all religions. New York has been America\u2019s most commercially minded and religiously pluralistic city ever since.\n\nThe next wave of migration began in the mid-18th century, when Scots-Irish from Ulster began to immigrate in numbers. Many arrived in Philadelphia and made their way westward and then down the Appalachians, populating the Southern upcountry. Their descendants have formed the backbone of a number of populist movements, from Andrew Jackson to Donald Trump.\n\nThe American Revolution changed immigration patterns in two ways. First, German immigration increased markedly when many of the Hessian mercenaries Great Britain had hired to help put down the colonial rebellion decided to stay. Some deserted; others returned to Germany only long enough to collect their families and return. Second, Britain, which had transported between 50,000 and 120,000 criminals to the American colonies, could no longer do so. As a result it founded Australia in 1788.\n\nAfricans first appeared in Virginia in 1617 as indentured servants. But soon they were arriving as slaves, surviving an ordeal utterly beyond modern imagination and passing that strength down the generations.\n\nColonial immigration had been unrestricted. The first restriction of any kind came in 1808, when the federal government outlawed the slave trade. While this reduced that odious commerce, it continued illegally until the Civil War. Altogether about a million Africans were brought to the U.S. against their will.\n\nThe first mass migration after independence began in the 1840s when the Irish potato famine drove about one million Irish to the New World, many to New York and Boston. This in turn sparked the first major opposition to immigration. Until then, the U.S. had been an overwhelmingly Protestant country. Now Catholics were flooding in, many willing to work for extremely low wages. An anti-immigrant political party, remembered as the Know Nothings, did well enough in the 1850s to elect a speaker of the House.\n\nImmigration largely ceased during the Civil War, but in the late 19th century one of history\u2019s greatest migrations began. People from Southern and Eastern Europe poured in, often at the rate of more than a million a year. As with the Irish, this wave encountered major political resistance.\n\nChinese immigration to the West Coast was increasingly restricted until 1882, when the Chinese Exclusion Act banned it altogether. After World War I, the U.S. passed its first comprehensive immigration restrictions. A 1921 law installing country-specific quotas greatly restricted immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe but left Western Europe inflows largely unchanged. Immigration from Latin America, however, was not restricted.\n\nThe Great Depression reversed the flow. For the first time more people emigrated from the U.S. than immigrated to it. Immigration was a mere 23,000 in 1933. But the return of prosperity brought renewed immigration\u2014including of seasonal workers from Mexico. In 1954 the federal government began, with the cooperation of the Mexican government, a highly effective program to deport illegal Mexican workers. More than a million were deported in the first year of \u201cOperation Wetback.\u201d\n\nIn 1965, amid the civil rights revolution, the national origin quotas were abolished. This resulted in greatly increased immigration from non-European countries, once again changing the character of the American population. With the advent of cheap air travel, the nature of illegal immigration changed. Today many illegal immigrants are people who came into the country legally but overstayed their visas. Modern opposition to immigration is for the most part not to immigration per se, nor to particular ethnic groups, as it was in the past, but to the perception that illegal immigration has undermined the rule of law.\n\nAmerica\u2019s prosperity, freedom and entrepreneurial spirit will always be a magnet for the ambitious and talented. It will remain one of the country\u2019s greatest strengths. But that doesn\u2019t mean the U.S. shouldn\u2019t decide who gets to come in.\n\nMr. Gordon is author of \u201cAn Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power.\u201d"}]
