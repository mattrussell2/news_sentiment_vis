But producers and distributors have yet to hit on a solid model for making money.\n\nSpotify and Pandora say they are well-positioned to do so, in part by tackling one of the medium\u2019s biggest challenges: It remains tricky for listeners to discover new podcasts.\n\n\u201cWhen you contrast it to music discovery, it\u2019s like it\u2019s in the Stone Age,\u201d Pandora Media Inc. Chief Executive Roger Lynch said. \u201cWe think we can expand our audience by bringing people in to listen to a certain podcast and keeping them on the platform with the music we have,\u201d he said.\n\nOver time, profit margins would grow because podcasts cost less than music, Mr. Lynch said.\n\nNeither Pandora nor Spotify Technology SA would disclose details of their nascent podcast businesses, including how much money they pay for programming or earn from it, or how much time listeners spend on the medium.\n\nEach company pays roughly three quarters of its revenue to license music, according to their financial filings, making profits elusive.\n\nSpotify says it carries 150,000 podcasts; Pandora says it has hundreds. Analysts estimate podcasts represent less than 1% of listening time on either service. Monthly podcast listenership in the U.S. has more than doubled over the past five years to 73 million, according to Edison Research.\n\nAlthough merger activity among podcast publishers has picked up in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented. Spotify and Pandora are expanding into a market with many distribution players yet no clear moneymaker, despite the huge potential audience.\n\nApple Inc. \u2014with over 600,000 podcasts available via its Apple Podcasts app\u2014has dominated the distribution market but doesn\u2019t collect revenue on them.\n\nThe most-innovative podcasting apps tend to be small and lack the kind of money the big streaming services can spend on engineering and discovery, Stifel analyst John Egbert said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where Spotify and Pandora come in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have very strong machine-learning and AI capabilities that have been focused on music for a long time.\u201d Both companies see podcasts as a natural fit: Music is the most popular genre of podcast, according to Nielsen.\n\nTop Podcast Publishers Podcast publishing and distribution remains highly fragmented Top publishers for October 2018 Unique monthly audience in the U.S.* NPR 18.9 million iHeartRadio 14.0 This American Life/Serial 9.9 Wondery 7.8 PRX 7.2 The New York Times 7.0 WNYC Studios 6.6 ESPN 6.4 Daily Wire 3.4 Barstool Sports 3.2\n\nAlthough podcasts have been available on both Spotify and Pandora for years, they have become a priority only in recent months. That has meant building out capabilities to fast forward and host longer-form content, as well as feature podcasts prominently on the platforms.\n\nBoth services are experimenting with ways to make money from podcasts, which are generally available free to consumers and supported by advertising. And both see podcasts as central to their goal of moving listeners off broadcast radio\u2014an industry that continues to command hundreds of thousands of weekly listeners and some $14 billion in annual ad revenue.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the minutes that are being spent on radio today haven\u2019t yet moved online. So our opportunity really is gigantic,\u201d Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said earlier this month. \u201cAs part of that, obviously, we think nonmusic content has a very important place.\u201d\n\nAd revenue from podcasts in the U.S. grew an estimated 86% last year to $313.9 million and is expected to top $402 million in 2018, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. Typically, a host reads sponsorship messages, or ads play during the podcast. Spotify so far sells ads only for its original, exclusive podcasts. Pandora plans to extract some or all of the ads in a podcast and replace them with its own.\n\nRadio Days According to a recent survey, Americans spend an average of 3 hours and 49 minutes each day consuming audio.

But from a longer-term competitive perspective, they are essential, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t lose a customer to someone else because you don\u2019t have podcasts,\u201d he said.\n\nSpotify and Pandora are testing different types of advertising deals with podcasters, exploring fixed fees versus payment based on listenership. They also are exploring content exclusives, either for a limited time or permanently.\n\nSpotify has struck deals to distribute an exclusive weekly podcast hosted by rapper Joe Budden and the first podcast from Vice News, \u201cChapo,\u201d about the Mexican drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n. Spotify\u2019s original podcasts include one with Amy Schumer that will be distributed broadly in its first year before becoming exclusive to Spotify, as well as branded podcasts with sponsors.\n\nJoe Budden, left, at the Joe Budden Podcast Live in New York City in 2017, has signed with Spotify to host an exclusive weekly podcast.

For now, they are about attracting and retaining customers.\n\nPandora last week unveiled a preview version of its new podcast offering, backed by what it calls the Podcast Genome Project.

So maybe Justice Department lawyers should have worn Barack Obama and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch masks this month when they announced their latest bank stickup.\n\nThat would have been fitting given the 202-page lawsuit, filed in New York federal court, that accuses the Swiss bank UBS of misleading investors about the risks of mortgage-backed securities before the financial panic of 2008. The case rests on an avant-garde legal interpretation from the Obama Administration, and UBS, to its credit, has decided to fight.\n\nThe lawsuit says UBS knew that many of the mortgages it securitized didn\u2019t meet lending criteria, and that the bank didn\u2019t perform the due diligence it promised investors. The government quotes a 2006 instant message from a UBS trader who said \u201cour crack due diligence effort is a joke.\u201d\n\nOther bank employees characterized two pools of loans, originated by Countrywide and WMC Mortgage Corp., as \u201ca bag of s---\u201d and \u201cbetter than little besides leprosy spores.\u201d Hardly a good look, but the Securities and Exchange Commission closed its investigation of UBS\u2019s mortgage-backed activities in 2013 without taking action.\n\nNow the Justice Department wants a second bite under an expansive reading of the 1989 Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (Firrea). Passed after the savings-and-loan crisis, Firrea penalizes those who harm a federally insured financial institution. But the Obama Administration decided to use Firrea against financial institutions.\n\nThis has resulted in farcical claims. Barclays was accused of defrauding those financial naifs at Citibank\u2014even while Justice claimed that Citibank perpetrated the same scheme. Wells Fargo was accused of committing fraud that harmed Wells Fargo, under a \u201cself-affecting\u201d interpretation of Firrea. If that\u2019s true, then does Wells deserve compensation from Wells?\n\nThe danger is that if the Obama Administration\u2019s broad reading of Firrea prevails, the Justice Department could act as a shadow securities regulator. Prosecutors are enamored with Firrea because it has a low burden of proof and 10-year statute of limitations, as opposed to the five-year stricture on the SEC.\n\nFirrea\u2019s limits haven\u2019t been fully tested in court, since most banks have preferred to sign billion-dollar settlements to make these cases go away. The Swiss appear to be made of stronger stuff.\n\nSimilar to its Firrea claims against other banks, Justice accuses UBS of misleading the institutions that bought its securities, such as the hayseeds at Merrill Lynch. The government also says UBS hurt liar-loan factories like IndyMac, because the bank\u2019s \u201csecuritization machine primed the pump for these loans, creating demand.\u201d\n\nThis is a strange claim, and not merely because we\u2019re supposed to feel bad for IndyMac. Everywhere else in the case files the government paints UBS as a victim of shops like IndyMac. Sloppy mortgage originators, the lawsuit says, \u201cfrequently pressured UBS to accept poor diligence results and defective loans under the threat of ending their business relationships.\u201d So who was really harming whom?\n\nUBS hasn\u2019t yet filed a formal legal response, but in a statement last week it argued that it lost billions during the mortgage crash, including nearly $900 million on the specific deals cited by the government\u2019s complaint: \u201cThis fact alone negates any inference that UBS engaged in an intentional fraud that was flatly against its own economic interest.\u201d\n\nThe bank adds that for the Justice Department to win under Firrea, the feds must prove that the alleged fraud is what caused investors\u2019 losses. \u201cThis theory flies in the face of the history of the housing crisis,\u201d UBS says. \u201cThe historic, market-wide downturn is commonly understood to be the result of a range of factors that created a housing bubble, including low interest rates and government policy.\u201d\n\nA deeper question is why the Trump Administration is continuing Mr. Obama\u2019s blame-the-banks campaign. Maybe it\u2019s inattention, given that the Justice Department\u2019s top personnel have lately been, well, distracted. In any case political appointees should now take notice: Having the Justice Department oversee banks isn\u2019t on President Trump\u2019s agenda. Bernie Sanders may think \u201cthe business model of Wall Street is fraud,\u201d but Republican administrations are supposed to know better."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "The Editorial Board", "title": "Florida's Close Election Call", "description": "Marc Elias is foiled in his attempt to change vote-counting rules.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/floridas-close-election-call-1542579560", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37747/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T22:19:22Z", "content": "The Democratic candidates for Governor and U.S. Senate in Florida finally conceded on the weekend, 11 days or so after the final votes were cast.

But that possibility was closer than it should have been as Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias tried to have tens of thousands of ballots counted in violation of normal election rules.\n\nMr. Elias used the counting follies in Democratic Broward and Palm Beach counties to demand that the legal deadlines be extended for vote counting and for mail-in ballots. Broward elections had to be ordered by courts to disclose how many votes they had left to count and what kind of votes they were. Mail-in ballots are valid if they arrive within 10 days of the election as a concession to voters serving in the U.S. military, but Mr. Elias was hoping to extend the election indefinitely as Democrats hunted for more votes somewhere, anywhere.\n\nFederal Judge Mark Walker was right to enforce regular vote-counting order. In the end Mr. DeSantis won by a little more than 33,000 votes and Mr. Scott led by 10,033 after the manual recount on Sunday.\n\nOne lesson is that Florida needs to tighten up on its absentee and provisional ballot rules.

It\u2019s impressive engineering, but it makes zero economic sense, according to Virginia\u2019s utilities regulators. They\u2019ve issued a scorching order that . . . approves the project. Yes, the surprise ending is that their factual analysis doesn\u2019t matter under a green fiat from the state Legislature.\n\nDominion Energy , Virginia\u2019s biggest utility, plans to spend $300 million to build the two turbines 27 miles off the coast. Together they will produce 12 megawatts of power, enough for 3,000 homes. This first pair of turbines is a \u201cdemonstration project\u201d to let Dominion gather data and experience. Then, as soon as 2024, it could begin dotting the adjacent waters with hundreds more, enough to generate 2,000 megawatts and light 500,000 homes.\n\nThis summer Dominion asked Virginia\u2019s State Corporation Commission, which regulates electric utilities, to deem the plan \u201cprudent.\u201d As reason to act swiftly, it cited pressure to cut carbon emissions. Senate Bill 966, championed by Dominion and signed in March by Gov. Ralph Northam, set a state objective of 5,000 megawatts of solar and wind power by 2028.\n\nThe commission\u2019s 20-page order, issued Nov. 2, is a takedown from front to back. \u201cDominion\u2019s customers will pay the costs of this Project,\u201d it says. The two turbines will generate electricity at 78 cents a kilowatt-hour\u2014compared with 9.4 cents for new onshore wind, 5.6 cents for new solar, and around three cents for energy bought on the open market.\n\nOther utility companies, the order adds, have pursued offshore wind by signing agreements to buy power from outside developers. Instead Dominion \u201cproposes a construction model, which places essentially all the risk on Dominion\u2019s customers.\u201d\n\nWhat about the $300 million cost? \u201cThe proposed Project is not the result of a competitive bidding process,\u201d says the commission. Dominion admits that it lacks \u201cdetailed information\u201d on the cost of other wind projects, and if overruns occur, \u201cit may seek additional cost recovery from customers.\u201d\n\nTrying to justify the two turbines as proof of concept doesn\u2019t work either, given that big offshore wind farms generate electricity at 13.1 cents per kWh. Since that\u2019s still higher than alternatives, what\u2019s left to prove? \u201cCustomers will pay at least $300 million (plus financing costs) to demonstrate a large-scale project that, based on Dominion\u2019s own studies, will not be a competitive option for the next 25 years,\u201d the commission says.\n\nNot that reality matters. \u201cAs a purely factual matter,\u201d the commission says, the proposal \u201cwould not be deemed prudent.\u201d But the Legislature has declared that offshore wind is \u201cin the public interest.\u201d Voil\u00e0, the petition is approved. That same day the utility issued a jaunty press release: \u201cDominion Energy Virginia customers are one step closer today to getting power from a new, renewable form of energy. The State Corporation Commission ruled in favor of plans to build two six-megawatt wind turbines.\u201d\n\nThis could hardly be improved as an illustration of environmental logrolling\u2014among a Republican state Legislature, a Democratic Governor, green activists and a utility company with a regulated monopoly. The State Corporation Commission deserves credit for calling attention to the fiasco. But if its hands are tied, then who\u2019s looking out for Dominion\u2019s 2.6 million customers?

Add that the U.S. has no extradition treaty with the South American cocaine producer, which has a history of refusing to send drug kingpins north to face justice, and the riddle becomes an enigma.\n\nEven the left-leaning United Nations Human Rights Committee ruled last week that the 45-year old center-right Colombian politician has been denied fundamental liberties recognized in international law. So what gives?\n\nTo clear things up, let\u2019s first stop pretending this is about the rule of law. This is politics.\n\nIn demanding the extradition, the weak center-right Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque is following the orders of the notoriously politicized Colombian Supreme Court. It convicted Mr. Arias on trumped up charges in 2014 to knock off a popular politician it viewed as an adversary. Now it\u2019s determined to see him locked up.\n\nSince the high court authorizes extraditions to the U.S., it is blackmailing the Trump administration: If Justice, State and the Drug Enforcement Administration expect Colombian narcos to be extradited in the future, the price is Mr. Arias on a platter. That\u2019s the trade.\n\nThis disgraceful bargain could be a new low even for U.S. government cynics. It\u2019s also an embarrassment for President Trump, who likes to say that no one pushes him around.\n\nIn 2009 Mr. Arias, a UCLA-trained economist and ally of former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, was the favorite to win the 2010 presidential election. That\u2019s when unsubstantiated allegations arose in the Colombian media that he had misappropriated funds in the agriculture ministry.\n\nIn sworn testimony in U.S. court in 2017, Mr. Arias said he was \u201cscared\u201d when the government of Juan Manuel Santos came after him. With the help of the U.S. embassy in Bogot\u00e1, which shared his concerns, Mr. Arias fled to Miami in 2014 and then applied for asylum. Two days after he left the country, the Colombian Supreme Court pronounced him guilty of embezzlement, though with no evidence that he benefited from any crime.\n\nColombia has signed and ratified the U.N.\u2019s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Last week the 18-member Human Rights Committee in Geneva ruled unanimously that, in the case of Mr. Arias, Colombia has failed to uphold its obligations under the covenant.\n\nThe committee said the Colombian high court\u2019s refusal to grant Mr. Arias an appeal violates international law. It also said Colombia violated Mr. Arias\u2019s rights by permanently prohibiting him from holding public office. The committee noted that Colombia has made a commitment to comply with committee findings and it called on Bogot\u00e1 to rectify the injustice within 180 days.\n\nNumerous reviews of the case, aired here and in other places, including in a paper published in August by Mr. Arias\u2019s international lawyer Jared Genser, find glaring irregularities in the conviction.\n\nA long, dark shadow of suspicion hangs over the Supreme Court that convicted Mr. Arias in 2014 by a vote of 7-1. One justice recused himself. Five of the seven assenting justices carry baggage that strains their credibility.\n\nThe president of the court at the time of the trial, Leonidas Bustos, along with Justice Gustavo Malo, are currently under investigation by Colombia\u2019s congress for allegations of bribery. The probe is looking into a huge judicial corruption scandal known as the \u201ccartel of the robe,\u201d which originated with a DEA wire investigation in Miami. Both maintain their innocence. Mr. Malo was suspended from the court; Mr. Bustos\u2019s term has ended.\n\nJustice Mar\u00eda Del Rosario Gonz\u00e1les claimed she had been a political target of Mr. Uribe and therefore couldn\u2019t be impartial. She asked to recuse herself but her request was denied. Justice Jos\u00e9 Luis Barcel\u00f3, also a political adversary of Mr. Uribe, is known for his partisanship from the bench. Justice Patricia Salazar Cu\u00e9llar wasn\u2019t even on the court when the Arias trial ended in February 2014. Nevertheless, she signed the court\u2019s sentence against him.\n\nJustice Department lawyer Robert Emeryargued in federal court in Miami in September 2017 that \u201cbased on the principles of international comity\u201d Mr. Arias needs to be sent back to Colombia out of \u201crespect\u201d for the Colombian Supreme Court. Knowing even a little of what the DEA must know about the court that convicted Mr. Arias, that\u2019s laughable. It\u2019s doubtful even Mr. Emery believes it.\n\nThe case is now before a federal appeals court in Atlanta. Mr. Duque could send instructions to the court clarifying there is no extradition treaty.

Mr. Mnuchin is right that a weak dollar would be good for U.S. exports, but he\u2019s wrong if he thinks it would benefit the economy as a whole. On the contrary, a weak dollar would impoverish the country.\n\nWealthy nations have strong currencies. A strong dollar allows Americans to buy goods, services and resources from other countries at low prices. Foreigners want to hold strong currencies, so they give goods in exchange for dollars that cost the Fed almost nothing to print.\n\nSeveral industries do stand to gain by pressuring for a weak dollar. That would make U.S. products cheaper and more attractive for foreign buyers, meaning U.S. manufacturers would export more, creating jobs and perhaps higher wages for their workers.\n\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images\n\nBut the country would be worse off. A weak dollar would increase inflation, and require Americans to pay more for what they buy from other countries. Americans also would have to pay more for products that the U.S. exports, as elevated foreign demand would increase prices at home. Additionally, U.S. businesses\u2014and indirectly, their investors\u2014would receive less value when they export goods and services, many of which are high-tech products foreigners can buy only from the U.S.\n\nIn short, with a weaker dollar, the U.S. would pay more for everything it buys and receive less for everything it sells. That\u2019s not how countries become or stay wealthy.\n\nOf course, the benefits of a strong dollar are not equally distributed. The rich consume more imported products, so they gain more. But this doesn\u2019t mean we need to hurt the country with a weak dollar to help the working class. A strong dollar expands the economic pie, allowing the government to transfer some of the resulting benefits from the rich to the working class, leaving everyone better off.\n\nAny such redistribution policy must be crafted carefully to avoid reducing incentives or opportunities to work. The best approach is to provide subsidies to employers for hiring low-income workers. Wage subsidies would ensure that more of these workers would be employed and earn higher wages\u2014a central object of weakening the dollar achieved at a far more reasonable cost. Wage subsidies also ensure that all recipients are working, making the country wealthier and more productive. The government should also support training programs to help the unemployed and underemployed acquire the skills necessary to produce the high-tech products that the U.S. exports.\n\nAlthough right-leaning Americans often oppose such government interventions, they are preferable to the alternatives. We would be worse off if voters used the ballot box to skew the exchange-rate policy or elect socialist politicians making dangerous promises.\n\nMaking the economic pie bigger is always better than fighting over how to cut it up. And the American pie is largest when the dollar is strong. Transferring some benefits of a strong dollar to the working class is the price the wealthy in this democratic country must pay to stay wealthy.\n\nMr. Harris is a professor of finance at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business.

The vision is gaining momentum, propelled in part by Donald Trump\u2019s diplomacy of rudeness against America\u2019s European allies.\n\nThere\u2019s one complication: European strategic autonomy, while it may be politically appealing, is military unrealistic. There are superior options for enhancing the Continent\u2019s role in international security.\n\nMr. Macron wants Europe to become \u201ca natural sovereign power.\u201d Militarily, this would require at least three core capabilities, says German Lt. Gen. Heinrich Brauss, a longtime North Atlantic Treaty Organization official who retired this summer: \u201can independent European nuclear deterrent, the ability to ensure collective defense of Europe, and the ability to carry out military-crisis interventions anywhere in the world.\u201d But Europe lacks the capacity to guarantee its own defense, and to act independently against major rivals.\n\nFor decades, Europe\u2019s nuclear umbrella has been provided by the U.S. Even if France were prepared to extend its nuclear deterrent to other nations, no European ally would want to forgo U.S. protection. Europe\u2019s militaries simply don\u2019t have enough of the large weapons systems necessary to credibly deter Russia or China. \u201cA large share of the military high-end capabilities and strategic enablers for NATO\u2019s full mission spectrum is provided by the United States,\u201d Gen. Brauss notes.\n\nReplacing such American capabilities as well as manpower would force European governments to dramatically increase military spending from an average of less than 2% of GDP. In 2016 EU member states spent about \u20ac200 billion ($226 billion) on defense, compared with America\u2019s $664 billion. And despite Mr. Trump\u2019s insolence, U.S. spending on the European Deterrence Initiative\u2014funding earmarked for European security, on top of the Pentagon\u2019s regular budget\u2014has increased from $789 million in 2016 to a requested $6.5 billion for next year.\n\nMr. Macron\u2019s \u201cEuropean army\u201d would require an integrated ground force, air force, and maritime force operating under a central command rather than under national governments. \u201cFor a true European army we\u2019d need a European government, and currently that\u2019s not in the realm of the possible,\u201d says retired-Adm. Giampaolo di Paola, a former chief of defense and defense minister of Italy who also served as chairman of NATO\u2019s military committee. The much more modest European Intervention Initiative, which Mr. Macron proposed in 2017, is already stalling. Germany suspects France is less interested in boosting European security than having allied troops relieve its forces in Africa.\n\nBut Mr. Macron is right that European defense is too fragmented, and there are realistic ways to address that problem. Some are already under way. Sweden and Finland have been integrating select air force and naval units since 2013. Sweden, Norway and Finland\u2019s air forces conduct joint exercises nearly every week and use one another\u2019s air bases. Belgium and the Netherlands maintain a shared naval fleet, and the Baltic states are considering building a combined navy. Together, France and Germany maintain a longstanding brigade. Parts of the Dutch Army are integrated into the German Army, and similar efforts are under way with German and Polish forces. Such pooling improves efficiency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very useful that the commander of the Dutch army has completed both the Dutch and the German general staff officer training,\u201d says Gen. Bruno Kasdorf, a former commander of the German army. \u201cReal European defense integration is only possible if future top commanders are well versed in other armed forces\u2019 distinct aspects.\u201d\n\nPeanuts? Perhaps. But incremental improvements are far more workable than visions of strategic autonomy. Adm. Di Paola argues that more bilateral integration is possible, with France, Germany, Italy or the U.K. as the senior partner.\n\nEuropeans must also strengthen their long-term security partnership with the U.S. Gen. Brauss notes that European allies should fulfill their commitments to enhancing the size, quality and readiness of their forces. \u201cImproved capabilities, along with more investment and more cooperation, would strengthen both NATO and Europe\u2019s ability to act,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would also improve trans-Atlantic burden-sharing.\u201d Mr. Trump would have considerably less fodder for angry tweets.\n\nThe danger of loose talk about strategic autonomy is that it becomes a botched self-fulfilling prophecy. The U.S. might take Europe at its word and disengage. Unless European politicians are willing to ask their voters to fund troops and weapons currently provided by the U.S., they should stop daydreaming about going solo.\n\nMs. Braw directs the Modern Deterrence project at the U.K.\u2019s Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "KC Johnson", "title": "DeVos Keeps Her Promise on Campus Due Process", "description": "Proposed new Title IX regulations aren\u2019t perfect, but they vastly improve on Obama-era guidance.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/devos-keeps-her-promise-on-campus-due-process-1542577788", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CK343_JOHNSO_SOC_20181116122235.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:49:50Z", "content": "Betsy DeVos kept her promise.

As the education secretary vowed in September 2017, the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights last week formally proposed new regulations designed to create a more just process when campus tribunals adjudicate sexual-misconduct allegations. The proposed rules closely track recent court rulings favoring accused students.\n\nIn 2017 interim guidance, Mrs. DeVos had invited schools to develop fairer procedures under the law known as Title IX. But nearly all retained the Obama administration\u2019s approach, which was heavily tilted against accused students. (The University of Kentucky was the most prominent exception.)\n\nThe most significant proposed change involves cross-examination, a fundamental element of due process. The Obama administration had strongly discouraged schools from allowing cross-examination of an accuser. \u201cIf someone tells their story and then they need to be questioned on it, that can be an incredibly invasive and traumatizing experience,\u201d Anurima Bhargava, an Obama Justice Department official, told the Journal this August. That\u2019s a presumption of guilt.\n\nState and federal courts alike have held that the resulting processes are unconstitutional. In a case from the University of Michigan this September, the federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of an accused student. \u201cNot only does cross-examination allow the accused to identify inconsistencies in the other side\u2019s story,\u201d Judge Amul Thapar wrote, \u201cbut it also gives the fact-finder an opportunity to assess a witness\u2019s demeanor and determine who can be trusted.\u201d The Supreme Court, quoting legal scholar John Wigmore, has repeatedly described cross-examination as \u201cgreatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u201d\n\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images\n\nThe proposed regulations would apply that principle nationally. They would require live hearings in all Title IX cases, with lawyers or other advocates for the accused conducting cross-examinations of witnesses. Cross-examination can\u2019t be effective unless accused students as well as accusers have access to all evidence\u2014routinely denied to accused students under current practice.\n\nThe proposed regulations would require that accuser and accused alike have access to all evidence gathered in the investigation. If witnesses chose not to participate in the hearing, their statements would be discounted. The new rules would also dismantle the transparently unfair \u201csingle investigator\u201d model, in which many colleges have allowed a single person, usually hired by the Title IX office, to be investigator, judge and jury.\n\nOne critical provision would mandate that schools turn over the materials they use to train adjudicators to either party on request. Washington\u2019s Obama-era guidance required that Title IX adjudicators receive training in \u201cthe effects of trauma, including neurobiological change.\u201d In practice, that is prejudicial: Many schools treat virtually any behavior by the accuser\u2014including actions that real courts properly interpret as evidence of deception\u2014as consistent with truthfulness. The University of Mississippi claims that \u201clies\u201d by an accuser shouldn\u2019t necessarily cast doubt on her credibility, arguing that lying simply is one of the \u201cdifferent responses\u201d a victim can have to a sexual assault.\n\nThe proposed rules include provisions favorable to accusers as well. They stress that institutions must provide accommodations to students who allege sexual assault on campus or within school programs. The Obama administration notoriously mandated that schools apply the low \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard in adjudicating claims. The new rules will permit them to continue doing so, and most almost certainly will. The regulations would impose limits on questioning about an accuser\u2019s sexual history, in line with rape shield laws. They would retain an Obama-era requirement that schools allow accusers to appeal not-guilty findings.\n\nIn the past two years, groups representing sexual-assault accusers have insisted that they only want a fair process, not one that railroads accused students. Their response to the regulations proposed will provide a test of their sincerity.\n\nThe procedures that result from these new rules won\u2019t be entirely fair to accused students. Unlike courtroom advocates, colleges lack subpoena power. And universities will still have strong incentives to favor accusers, if only to pre-empt media criticism or appease campus activist groups. But as the proposed regulations note, when a university \u201cestablishes an equitable process with due process protections and implements it consistently, its findings will be viewed with more confidence by the parties and the public.\u201d\n\nMessrs.

But conflicts with federal law will make state-level health-insurance mandates ineffective or unduly onerous, and governors and legislatures would do well to steer clear.\n\nWhile states can require citizens to purchase health coverage, they will have trouble ensuring compliance. Federal law prohibits the Internal Revenue Service from disclosing tax-return data, except under limited circumstances. And there is no clear precedent allowing the IRS to disclose coverage data to verify compliance with state insurance requirements.\n\nPhoto: Richard B. Levine/Zuma Press\n\nAccordingly, mandates enacted in New Jersey and the District of Columbia earlier this year created their own coverage-reporting regimes. But those likely conflict with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, which explicitly pre-empts \u201cany and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d The point is to protect large employers who self-insure workers from 50 sets of conflicting state laws.\n\nNo employer has used Erisa to challenge Massachusetts\u2019 2006 individual mandate, which includes reporting requirements, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s legal. Last month a Brookings Institution paper conceded that \u201cstate requirements related to employer benefits like health coverage may be subject to legal challenge based on ERISA preemption.\u201d\n\nA 2016 Supreme Court ruling would bolster such a challenge. In Gobeille v. Liberty Mutual, the court struck down a Vermont law that required employers to submit health-care payment claims to a state database. The court said the law was pre-empted by Erisa.\n\nWriting for a six-justice majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy noted the myriad reporting requirements under federal law. Vermont\u2019s law required additional record-keeping. Justice Kennedy concluded that \u201cdiffering, or even parallel, regulations from multiple jurisdictions could create wasteful administrative costs and threaten to subject plans to wide-ranging liability.\u201d\n\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s opinion provides a how-to manual for employers to challenge state-level insurance mandates. A morass of state-imposed insurance mandates and reporting requirements would unnecessarily burden employers with costs and complexity. It cries out for pre-emptive relief.\n\nUnfortunately, policy makers have ignored these concerns. Notes from the working group that recommended the District of Columbia\u2019s individual mandate never mention the reporting burden or Erisa pre-emption. And in August the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved New Jersey\u2019s waiver application that relied in part upon funding from that state\u2019s new individual mandate, even though money from the difficult-to-enforce requirement may never materialize.\n\nStates already cannot require federal agencies to report coverage. This means their mandates won\u2019t track the 2.3 million covered by the Indian Health Service, 9.3 million receiving health care from the Veterans Administration, 8.8 million disabled under age 65 who are enrolled in Medicare, 9.4 million military Tricare enrollees and 8.2 million federal employees and retirees.\n\nIf a successful Erisa challenge also exempts some of the 181 million with employer-based insurance from coverage-reporting requirements, state insurance mandates become farcical. States would have to choose between mandates that run on the \u201chonor system\u201d\u2014thus likely rife with cheating\u2014or taking so much time and energy to verify coverage that administration becomes prohibitively expensive.\n\nStates should take the hint and refrain from even considering their own coverage mandates. But if they don\u2019t, smart employers should challenge the mandate\u2019s reporting requirements.

At least 73 people have died and more than 1,300 are missing.\n\nThe fire was reported at 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 8. The flames moved swiftly, driven downhill toward Paradise by winds reaching 55 miles an hour. By 8 a.m. the town was engulfed. Though conditions were harrowing, most were able to flee to safety.\n\nThe Camp Fire bears striking similarities to a wildfire that killed 99 people in Mati, a wooded coastal suburb of Athens, Greece, this summer. It is highly likely that both the Paradise and Mati fires were caused by electric lines downed by high winds. In both countries, fire crews fought heroically to contain the fires, but were stretched thin and had difficulty maintaining situational awareness. In both countries, planning was insufficient because officials thought the probability of a devastating wildfire appeared remote. \u201cNobody thought this could happen,\u201d said President Trump on Saturday.\n\nAlthough a fraction of the Camp Fire\u2019s size, the Mati fires killed a much larger share of the affected population. That\u2019s because residents of Mati had never participated in an evacuation drill and so were unprepared to flee in an orderly fashion. Many of Mati\u2019s 5,000 residents panicked and ran to the coastline, where high coastal cliffs protected 800 people who managed to hike down to the beach. Without the cliffs, the death toll would have been even higher.\n\nIn both Mati and Paradise, survivors disproved dire predictions about how long it takes to get out of harm\u2019s way in a natural disaster. Computer models showed that Mati could be evacuated in about 60 minutes. In reality the most severely burned area self-evacuated in about 30 minutes, even though no evacuation order was given. People simply ran for their lives. A full evacuation order was issued in Paradise around 9 a.m., while the town was already burning.\n\nGovernment officials often delay ordering mandatory large-scale evacuations, either out of a belief that panic will cost lives or that there will be a political cost for causing inconvenience if the threat ends up being overstated. People get angry when they are forced to leave home for a disaster that doesn\u2019t materialize. In both California and Greece, most people heard about the fire not from government emergency-alert systems but from neighbors or friends.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s first responders saved an untold number of lives last week. The state\u2019s Office of Emergency Services\u2019 key focus on managing a robust mutual-aid system among jurisdictions helped reduce losses and ameliorate suffering. But looking ahead, this may not be enough.\n\nWildfires will become more intense and frequent in the coming decades because of climate change, overdevelopment and poor forest management. Mediterranean climates will be especially vulnerable. Governments and utilities must find the money to bury electricity wires in fire-prone areas. Officials must also prepare people to evacuate their homes and workplaces when\u2014not if\u2014life-threatening weather or fire approaches. In at-risk areas, everyone needs to adopt the assumption that such a deadly natural disaster could happen tomorrow and that they might need to leave immediately.\n\nMr. Synolakis is a professor of civil engineering and an expert on natural disasters at the University of Southern California."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Suzanne Kapner", "title": "Black Friday Shoppers Beware: Online Shopping Gets More Complicated", "description": "As Americans gear up for the year-end shopping spree that marks its start with Black Friday, those who order online will have some tough choices to make.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/black-friday-shoppers-beware-online-shopping-gets-more-complicated-1542556800", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37119/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T20:41:20Z", "content": "As Americans gear up for the year-end shopping spree that marks its start with Black Friday, those who order online will have some tough choices to make.

Now, investigators are examining how plane maker Boeing Co. BA -1.58% heeded those earlier warnings.\n\nThe latest investigation has expanded to delve into whether Boeing\u2014as well as regulators specifically responsible for certifying the sensor system\u2014fully incorporated those earlier safety lessons into the final design of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, the model that crashed in Indonesia, according to industry and government officials.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw the design and testing of the suspect sensor and related hardware, has said it is reviewing risk analyses and pilot-training requirements originally developed by Boeing. These actions are part of the crash investigation led by Indonesian authorities, according to the agency.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Boeing said it \u201ccontinually learns from its fleet experience, which includes closely following aircraft incidents and airworthiness directives that are issued, and then strives to incorporate lessons learned into its designs and recommended procedures.\u201d Regulators issue airworthiness directives to mandate safety fixes, and typically aircraft operators are given firm deadlines by which they need to finish the inspections or other required actions.\n\nThe company also reiterated it continues to provide technical assistance to investigators examining the Lion Air crash.\n\nCalled angle-of-attack indicators, the system on the 737 MAX 8 models sends data to flight-control computers about how high or low a plane\u2019s nose or wings are compared to level flight. But if erroneous information is transmitted in certain situations while pilots are flying manually, the plane\u2019s computers will automatically and repeatedly push the nose down. Investigators have said publicly this is what they believe occurred on Lion Air Flight 610, because some apparent problem with the sensor system incorrectly indicated the plane was on an excessively steep climb at a relatively slow speed.\n\nOn MAX 8 models, under certain conditions, pilots may be unable to pull the plane out of a dive unless they react quickly and proceed to the most relevant portion of their emergency checklist. One fundamental question is how the FAA gave the green light for a system in which one malfunctioning sensor\u2014called a \u201csingle point failure\u201d in engineering lingo\u2014can lead to a catastrophic dive.\n\nFlip the Switch Pulling back on the yoke won't stop a stall-prevention system in Boeing's new 737 MAX planes from pushing the nose down if it is getting bad sensor data. But turning off the system will. In Boeing's older 737 models, a common practice of pulling back on the control column (yoke) will stop cockpit systems from automatically pushing down the plane's nose. In Boeing's new 737 Max models, pulling back the yoke won't work if its stall- prevention system is getting faulty data from sensors. But an existing procedure works for both: pilots flip switches to keep the plane from pushing the nose down. Windshield Throttle quadrant Yoke Yoke Cutoff\n\nInvestigators haven\u2019t determined exactly what role erroneous angle-of-attack data played in the Lion Air tragedy, and other potential malfunctions or factors may have contributed. In addition, since the crash, Boeing has said its flight manuals and training materials adequately addressed the risks, privately telling pilots and airlines that any pilot who follows required procedures can avoid a crash, according to government and industry officials familiar with the discussions.\n\nIn addition to sensor hardware, investigators also are looking into operation of separate software used to digitally process signals from sensors.\n\nAs far back as 2013, however, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic issued safety directives mandating emergency pilot responses to ensure that failures of the same type of sensors on long-range Airbus SE A330 and 340 models didn\u2019t result in an uncontrolled dive. Concluding that in some cases an aircraft\u2019s nose couldn\u2019t be raised even with maximum pilot manual commands, regulators ordered that suspect parts be replaced.\n\nThe following year, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an emergency order revising certain cockpit procedures to deal with blocked angle-of-attack sensors on thousands of Airbus wide-body and narrow-body jets. And just last month, U.S. regulators increased the number of Airbus A319 and A320 models included in a different safety directive also focused on the dangers of blocked sensors.\n\nThose previous actions primarily covered angle-of-attack sensors that were blocked or rendered temporarily inoperative by icing. The Lion Air probe is assessing other potential causes for problems with the sensor.\n\nRegarding Boeing aircraft, the FAA in 2013 proposed a safety directive mandating inspection and possible replacement of angle-of-attack sensors affecting a total of more than 1,000 747 jumbo jets and older 737 models. The agency determined malfunctioning sensors could result in false stall warnings to pilots during takeoffs.\n\nAs the latest investigation gains steam, safety experts increasingly are paying attention to the same category of dire consequences that confronted Airbus crews: forceful, automated nose-down commands while flying manually, which can be particularly dangerous if pilots are surprised and confused about how to counteract them.\n\nSome of the data-processing units for angle-of-attack sensors and others measuring airspeed on the Lion Air jet were manufactured by Honeywell International Inc. A spokesman said the company has been contacted by the National Transportation Safety Board and is cooperating. The probe is expected to examine whether possible problems with those units may have contributed to the crash.\n\nThe sensors themselves were supplied by a United Technologies Corp. unit, which didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIntroducing new systems, even those meant to enhance safety such as the MAX 8\u2019s stall-protection features, can come with pitfalls as teething difficulties are addressed, according to safety experts.\n\nWhen a previous upgrade to Boeing\u2019s 737 plane entered service, it also created problems. A British Midland 737-400 crashed in England on Jan. 8, 1989, after an engine failure, killing 47 of the 126 people onboard. Investigators determined new cockpit instruments, though not the cause of the accident, made it more difficult for the crew to manage the situation. They recommended enhanced training for pilots.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for manufacturers is to introduce the sorts of technology which have made aviation as safe as it is\u201d while simultaneously \u201cminimizing the conversion training that is required to fly different aircraft of the same family,\u201d said Graham Braithwaite, who teaches safety and accident investigation at Britain\u2019s Cranfield University.\n\n\u2014Andrew Tangel contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com and Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Sam Goldfarb", "title": "Debt-Market Slowdown Troubles Investors", "description": "When businesses have sold debt recently, they have often struggled to attract much interest, triggering worries that borrowing costs for U.S. companies might go up.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-market-slowdown-troubles-investors-1542568103", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37705/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T19:43:41Z", "content": "Signs of stress are mounting in the corporate-bond market, where rising interest rates and lackluster demand for new debt have investors questioning whether a long run of favorable borrowing conditions for U.S. companies is ending or merely hitting a rough pa\u2026 [+6370 chars]", "fulltext": "Signs of stress are mounting in the corporate-bond market, where rising interest rates and lackluster demand for new debt have investors questioning whether a long run of favorable borrowing conditions for U.S. companies is ending or merely hitting a rough patch.\n\nThe amount of extra yield, or spread, that investors demand to hold investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds instead of benchmark U.S. Treasurys in recent days reached its highest level in nearly two years, while spreads on junk-rated bonds hit a 19-month high.\n\n..."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Erich Schwartzel", "title": "Less-Than-'Fantastic' Start for Harry Potter Spinoff - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Less-Than-'Fantastic' Start for Harry Potter Spinoff Wall Street Journal LOS ANGELES\u2014Harry Potter's spell on moviegoers is proving more effective overseas. \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,\u201d the latest installment in J.K.
