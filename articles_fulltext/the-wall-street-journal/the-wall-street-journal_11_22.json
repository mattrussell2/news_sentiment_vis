The U.S. is also considering increasing financial aid for telecommunications development in countries that shun Chinese-made equipment, some of these people say.\n\nOne U.S. concern centers on the use of Chinese telecom equipment in countries that host American military bases, according to people familiar with the matter. The Defense Department has its own satellites and telecom network for especially sensitive communications, but most traffic at many military installations travels through commercial networks.\n\nThe international effort extends the battle lines of a U.S. campaign to keep Huawei electronics out of the U.S. Some officials see the initiative as part of a broader technological Cold War between U.S.-led allies and China for control of a world that is increasingly digitally connected\u2014and thus increasingly vulnerable to surveillance and malfeasance. They fear the rise of technological giants that could benefit authoritarian governments, including irritants or outright foes of the U.S.\n\nThe initiative also coincides with rising tensions between Washington and Beijing on other fronts this year as the Trump administration moves to counter what some U.S. officials say they see as years of unbridled Chinese aggression. Washington has placed tariffs on some imports from China, drawing retaliation from Beijing. The U.S. has also tightened up foreign-investment rules targeting Chinese deal making.\n\nOfficials familiar with the current effort say concerns about telecom-network vulnerabilities predate the Trump era and reflect longstanding national-security worries.\n\nThe overseas push comes as wireless and internet providers around the world prepare to buy new hardware for 5G, the coming generation of mobile technology. 5G promises superfast connections that enable self-driving cars and the \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d in which factories and such everyday objects as heart monitors and sneakers are internet-connected.\n\nU.S. officials say they worry about the prospect of Chinese telecom-equipment makers spying on or disabling connections to an exponentially growing universe of things, including components of manufacturing plants.\n\n\u201cWe engage with countries around the world about our concerns regarding cyberthreats in telecommunications infrastructure,\u201d a U.S. official said. \u201cAs they\u2019re looking to move to 5G, we remind them of those concerns. There are additional complexities to 5G networks that make them more vulnerable to cyberattacks.\u201d\n\nThe briefings are aimed at dissuading governments and telecom executives from using Huawei network components in both government and commercially operated networks. A core focus of the briefings is Beijing\u2019s ability to force Chinese corporations to comply with government requests from government authorities, a U.S. official said.\n\nSome major carriers say Huawei\u2019s broad offering of components, lower costs and high quality make it a difficult provider to do without. Photo: Michael Hanson for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe talking points also emphasize how wireless and internet networks in a few years could be more susceptible to cyberattacks or espionage, people familiar with the briefings said. Today\u2019s cellular-tower equipment, for instance, is largely isolated from the \u201ccore\u201d systems that transfer much of a network\u2019s voice and data traffic. But in the 5G networks telecom carriers are preparing to install, cellular-tower hardware will take over some tasks from the core\u2014and that hardware could potentially be used to disrupt the core via cyberattacks. For that reason, U.S. officials worry that Huawei or ZTE cellular-tower equipment could compromise swaths of a telecom network.\n\nHuawei is the world\u2019s No. 2 smartphone maker behind Samsung Electronics Co. It is the global leader for telecom equipment, such as the hardware that goes into cellular towers, internet networks and other infrastructure that enables modern communication.\n\nThe company has been all but shut out of that market in the U.S. after a 2012 congressional report labeled it a national-security threat. American officials say the company could be compelled by Beijing to use its knowledge of its components to snoop on or disrupt telecommunications networks.\n\nHuawei has long said it is an employee-owned company and isn\u2019t beholden to any government, and has never used its equipment to spy on or sabotage other countries. It said its equipment is as safe as that of Western competitors, such as Finland\u2019s Nokia Corp. and Sweden\u2019s Ericsson , because all manufacturers share common supply lines.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Huawei said it has its customers\u2019 trust and was \u201csurprised by the behaviors of the U.S. government\u201d detailed in this article. \u201cIf a government\u2019s behavior extends beyond its jurisdiction, such activity should not be encouraged,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Trump administration and Congress this year initiated a multipronged push to tighten up restrictions on Huawei and other Chinese telecom-equipment manufacturers, including ZTE Corp. The Federal Communications Commission, for instance, moved to restrict federal subsidies to some carriers if they buy Chinese gear.\n\nEven without U.S. business, Huawei dominates the world\u2019s telecom-equipment market. Last year, the company held a 22% share globally, according to research firm IHS Markit Ltd. Nokia had 13%, Ericsson had 11% and ZTE was in fourth at 10%.\n\nSome other members of the \u201cFive Eyes,\u201d a five-member intelligence pact among English-speaking countries that includes the U.S., have also publicly challenged Huawei. The Australian government in August banned Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks. In October, U.K. authorities said they were reviewing the makeup of its telecom-equipment market, a move industry leaders said was clearly aimed at Huawei.\n\nStill, there is a big hitch to U.S. efforts to curb Huawei overseas: The company is already popular among carriers in allied countries, including some of America\u2019s closest military partners. Some major carriers in these places say Huawei offers the most products and often customizes them to fit a carrier\u2019s needs. They also cite lower costs and high quality.\n\n\u201cThere is only one true 5G supplier right now, and that is Huawei,\u201d said Neil McRae, chief network architect for large British carrier BT Group PLC, at a Huawei event in London earlier this week. \u201cThe others need to catch up.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to narrow that advantage in some countries, Washington is considering ways to increase funding from various U.S. government sources to subsidize the purchase and use of non-Chinese equipment, according to people familiar with the matter. Countries buying Chinese telecommunications equipment would be ineligible for such subsidies.\n\nIn the past year, U.S. officials, including representatives from the National Security Council and Commerce, Defense and State departments, worked together to produce briefing notes about why they believe Chinese telecom equipment poses national-security risks, people familiar with the matter said. One U.S. government official said they focused on Huawei but also included ZTE, a Chinese rival with a much smaller business outside China.\n\nA ZTE representative declined to comment on the U.S. effort.\n\nWashington has circulated the notes to national-security officials as well as to embassies, with the idea that they can deliver the message to foreign officials and telecom executives, some of the people said.\n\nA spokesman for the Commerce Department said it would \u201cremain vigilant against any threat to U.S. national security.\u201d Spokesmen for the National Security Council and the State Department declined to comment. The Defense Department didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\n\nU.S. officials have briefed counterparts in Germany, which has signaled a new wariness toward Huawei, according to people familiar with the matter. Huawei this month opened a lab in Germany similar to one it already operates in Britain, where Huawei products are inspected for security flaws. The U.K. government said in July it found shortcomings in the process.\n\nGermany\u2019s Federal Office for Information Security declined to comment.\n\nAmerican officials have also briefed Japanese officials about Huawei, people familiar with the matter said. A Japanese government official said \u201cwe share various information with the U.S.,\u201d but declined to comment on specifics. Japanese officials in August said they were studying restrictions on Huawei.\n\nIn Italy, U.S. officials met with executives of one of the country\u2019s major telecom carriers to explain the risk of using Huawei and ZTE equipment, according to a company board member. He said his carrier was aware of the risks but planned to keep using Huawei.\n\n\u201cWe cannot ignore Huawei because they are a leading telecom-equipment provider world-wide, and that\u2019s a very tough call,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014Giovanni Legorano in Rome, Mayumi Negishi in Tokyo, Dan Strumpf in Hong Kong and Sara Germano in Berlin contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com and Kate O\u2019Keeffe at kathryn.okeeffe@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "The Editorial Board", "title": "Putin Loses One", "description": "Interpol rejects the Russian-backed candidate for president.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/putin-loses-one-1542868805", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38013/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T21:58:06Z", "content": "Sometimes even Vladimir Putin doesnt get his way.

Sixty percent of employer-insured Americans are covered though self-insurance arrangements, meaning their employer bears the risk of their health-care costs. An insurance company merely processes the claims, paying for care from the employer\u2019s bank account.\n\nEmployers have good reason to prefer self-insurance. Most don\u2019t think politicians should decide what benefits they cover for their employees, and self-insurance plans are exempt from the state regulations that constrain insurer-provided options, such as rules mandating coverage for freezing eggs. With insurer-provided coverage, employers would have to cope with as many sets of regulations as the number of states in which they operate. And unlike self-insurance, insurer-provided coverage is subject to state taxes, adding to its cost.\n\nThe downside is that most self-insurance plans cover care through open-ended fee-for-service payments, meaning they have no capped budget within which doctors and hospitals agree to deliver all necessary care. Attaching payments to each test and treatment gives doctors an incentive to resolve all doubts about a patient\u2019s condition by providing more and more costly services, whether or not they are necessary or beneficial. Therefore they have little reason to hold down prices or innovate to reduce the cost of care.\n\nA better alternative to fee-for-service is \u201cprepaid group practice.\u201d Under PGP plans, employers pay hospital networks fixed, periodic payments agreed to in advance. This means doctors can\u2019t run up employers\u2019 bills. PGPs also can be structured to reward prevention of diseases and injuries. Within that model, doctors prosper by keeping their patients well, or by managing chronic conditions so costs are kept low\u2014not by offering expensive, unnecessary services. Some of the nation\u2019s largest PGPs are operated by Kaiser Permanente, which covers nearly 12 million members in eight states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe National Academies found in 2012 that about 30% of U.S. health-care spending is wasted, providing no benefit to patients. The PGP model provides an incentive to reduce or eliminate waste. The RAND Health Insurance Experiment from 1974-82 estimated that Group Health Cooperative, a PGP now part of Kaiser Permanente, provided high-quality care to randomly assigned patients for 28% less than the cost of fee-for-service care in the same community. They accomplished this mainly by focusing less on intensive hospital care and more on outpatient care, preventing patients from reaching the point where costly hospital treatments were necessary.\n\nSo why haven\u2019t PGPs taken over more of U.S. employer-provided health care? One reason is that PGPs typically build their own facilities and recruit their own doctors to train them in their more economical style of care, all of which takes time and capital. Another reason is that they bear the risk of the cost of care, meaning state laws define them as insurance companies rather than providers of self-insurance. As part of a future health-care reform, Congress could exempt PGP benefits from regulation by the states, allowing employers to negotiate over coverage details.\n\nPrice competition among plans is another simple way to encourage savings. Some employers\u2014including my own, Stanford University\u2014offer multiple options in which the employer pays only the price of the low-cost plan, and employees who choose more costly plans must pay the full difference. But many employers shy away from such competition, because workers accustomed to having their plans fully covered see it as a \u201ctakeaway.\u201d Most companies therefore offer a single traditional health-insurance plan.\n\nA few employers do offer employees competing choices, and they have reaped the benefits. Operating since 1960, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program offers hundreds of choices, though less in any one location. Employers contribute a fixed dollar amount set at 72% of the average premium, giving employees a reason to be cost conscious in their choices.\n\nThe health-benefits division of the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System offers 15 plans. The University of California offers six choices and typically pays for the lowest-price plan serving each campus, again encouraging savings. Similar systems have been adopted from Stanford to the state of Wisconsin.\n\nIn competitive coverage models the employer contributes a fixed-dollar amount, aligning the incentives of providers with the interests of consumers and producing better care at a lower cost. Consumers benefit from making economical choices, and providers are rewarded with more customers for delivering good value. Employers paying for the low-price plan save money they would have spent on a more expensive single option.\n\nSome very large employers like Boeing , with big concentrations of workers across a few locations, have created health-care systems of their own that blend self-insurance and competition. But most smaller employers lack the size and expertise to do this.\n\nAnother model has emerged over the past decade: the accountable care organization. In an ACO, doctors, hospitals and coverage providers strike a voluntary agreement to share responsibility for quality and cost. The ACO can be seen as a step on the path to a PGP, shifting some of the risk from insurers or employers to providers, and giving the providers an incentive to control costs.\n\nThis year more than 10.5 million Americans are beneficiaries of ACOs. Understanding the limitations of typical self-insurance, businesses should continue to explore emerging models of care, which have the potential to expand choice, increase quality and find savings for their employees.\n\nMr. Enthoven is a professor emeritus in the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "David B.

Now the IRS is at it again. Earlier this year it issued a rule suppressing huge swaths of First Amendment protected speech. The regulation appears designed to hamper the marijuana industry, which is still illegal under federal law although many states have enacted decriminalization measures. But it goes far beyond that.\n\nThe innocuously named Revenue Procedure 2018-5 contains a well-hidden provision enabling the Service to withhold tax-exempt status from organizations seeking to improve \u201cbusiness conditions . . . relating to an activity involving controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the Controlled Substances Act) which is prohibited by federal law.\u201d That means that to obtain tax-exempt status under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s Section 501\u2014whether as a charity, social-welfare advocacy group or other type of nonprofit\u2014an organization may not advocate for altering the legal regime applicable to any Schedule I or II substance.\n\nMarijuana is a Schedule I substance, meaning the Food and Drug Administration has found it has \u201cno currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\u201d Schedule II drugs include such widely prescribed medications as Adderall, Vyvanse, codeine and oxycodone. The IRS can deny tax-exempt status to any organization that seeks to improve the \u201cbusiness conditions\u201d of a currently prohibited activity involving these medications. That could include simply advocating for a change in the law or regulation forbidding the possession, sale or use of marijuana or other Schedule I substances. It would also encompass advocacy for relaxing the regulatory regime currently governing the production, distribution or prescription of Schedule II medications.\n\nThe rule does not apply to all speech dealing with the listed substances, only that involving an \u201cimprovement\u201d in \u201cbusiness conditions,\u201d such as legalization or deregulation. Efforts to maintain restrictions or impose additional ones are fine by the IRS. This is constitutionally pernicious viewpoint discrimination. As the Supreme Court stated in Rosenberger v. University of Virginia (1995): \u201cWhen the government targets not subject matter, but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant.\u201d\n\nDefenders of the IRS may argue that tax-exempt status is a privilege, not a right. But the court has held that the government cannot require recipients of governmental largess to relinquish constitutional rights in return\u2014particularly free-speech rights.\n\nThe IRS may point to Bob Jones University v. U.S. (1983), in which the high court upheld the denial of tax-exempt status to a private school with racially discriminatory practices that were \u201ccontrary to settled public policy.\u201d But public policy on drugs, especially marijuana, is far from settled. A majority of states have enacted legalization measures contrary to federal law; Michigan, Missouri and Utah all did so this month. And Congress has already defunded Justice Department prosecutions of medical cannabis businesses that are legal under state law.\n\nMore important, Bob Jones involved not advocacy but action\u2014discriminatory policies that constrained the university\u2019s students. The case would likely have come out differently if the schools complied with public policy while arguing that it should change.\n\nAlthough no constitutional right is absolute, governmental policies that burden First Amendment rights are strictly scrutinized by the courts and will be upheld only if based upon a compelling governmental interest.\n\nThe framers of the Bill of Rights had experienced the full brunt of British antisedition laws, which were used to punish political advocacy. They were determined that this never happen again. Banning or even burdening the freedom to advocate for changing governmental policies, no matter how unpopular or odious the message may be, violates not only the First Amendment but the idea of government by the people. Impeding such advocacy cannot have any legitimate governmental purpose, much less a compelling one.\n\nAccordingly, while government has been able to justify limiting activities or conduct even when it has an expressive or religious component, the Supreme Court has sanctioned limits on the content of speech only in extreme circumstances. In Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (2010), for instance, the justices upheld a ban on policy advocacy undertaken under the direction of, or in coordination with, certain terrorist groups. This narrow prohibition was constitutional only because the coordinated speech amounted to a \u201cmaterial support\u201d to terrorist groups. The same speech, if conducted independently, would have been fully protected.\n\nHere, by contrast, the IRS seeks to control independent policy advocacy. That\u2019s something the federal government may not do. Yet it\u2019s the second time this decade for the IRS.\n\nMessrs.

Yet the children likely won\u2019t know that a tax collector is, once again, on the prowl. And that their Sunday schools and churches are targeted.\n\nA little-noticed provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 now looms over faith communities in America, raising serious questions about religious freedom and the First Amendment. While this provision is a relatively small piece of the overall package, the effect of the policy it created will be felt by the faithful around the country.\n\nThis change is a new policy to tax nonprofit organizations\u2014including houses of worship, like the Southern Baptist churches I serve\u2014for the cost of parking and transit benefits provided to employees. This effectively creates an income tax on churches. As Michael Martin of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability has noted, that has never happened in U.S. history.\n\nThe imposition of a tax burden on churches, religious schools and other charities is a shocking change in the federal government\u2019s orientation toward these organizations of goodwill. The new tax requires institutions to file federal Form 990-T and possibly pay taxes every year\u2014regardless of whether they engage in any unrelated business activity. In addition to the new federal requirements, many nonprofits will then face the requirement to file state returns and possibly pay state income tax.\n\nFurther, in the name of taxing parking lots, the new regulations created a new tax liability. In turn, this creates new operating costs for proper accounting and regulatory compliance at every nonprofit organization. For many nonprofits, these operations costs could exceed the amount of money actually collected by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThis new tax would extract $1.7 billion from the charities over 10 years. Whatever purpose Section 512(a)(7) was intended to serve, it simply cannot justify taking this $1.7 billion toll on churches and charities. Ultimately, this isn\u2019t a levy on the organizations. It is a tax on the people and vulnerable communities they serve.\n\nBeyond the practical downsides, Congress should also consider first principles. Taxing houses of worship is deeply un-American\u2014no matter how large or small the tax burden. The proper separation of the state from the church is at the heart of the American project. As the Founders understood, the power to tax is the power to destroy. Tax laws don\u2019t exist to give special privileges for religious organizations. They are meant to recognize that, unlike in other places and at other times, the state here doesn\u2019t regulate, or subsidize, the worship of God.\n\nThis summer Rep. Mark Walker introduced H.R. 6460, the LIFT for Charities Act, which would repeal Section 512(a)(7) from the code. James Lankford of Oklahoma introduced a Senate version of the bill in August. The two pieces of legislation move the conversation closer to a sensible change in course from the current detrimental path of taxing nonprofits. By striking this new section of the code, the LIFT Act would eliminate this new tax burden and operational impediment on churches and nonprofits.\n\nThis sizable shift in the treatment of charitable organizations by the federal government may well have been unanticipated but the negative effects are as clear as they are unacceptable. This provision in the tax-reform legislation has pushed religious communities into uncharted waters, and it ought to be repealed. Congress can take up and pass the Walker and Lankford bills during the lame-duck session.\n\nSunday school children can tell the tax collector: Jesus loves you. He\u2019s happy to have you at church. But he doesn\u2019t work for you.\n\nMr. Moore is president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Michael Saltsman", "title": "A $15 Minimum Wage Goes National", "description": "Nancy Pelosi wants to boost the wage floor far higher than the historical average.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-15-minimum-wage-goes-national-1542918020", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38096/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T20:20:22Z", "content": "The Fight for $15 minimum-wage movement has fought its way to the top of Democrats 2019 agenda.

Don\u2019t be so sure. Two of the last three minimum-wage increases were signed by GOP presidents.

If these Republicans want to avoid a fight, Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s 100 hours may not be necessary.\n\nFor the past five years, Democrats have been radicalizing on the minimum-wage issue. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Barack Obama identified a $9 federal minimum wage as the ideal; by the following year, Democrats had rallied around $10.10. In 2015, Rep. Scott\u2019s Raise the Wage Act proposed a $12 minimum wage. In 2017, 23 Senate Democrats led by Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced their own Raise the Wage Act, embracing the $15 figure popularized by the Service Employees International Union.\n\nHistorically, the federal minimum-wage standard has been more modest. Established by the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, the first federal minimum was $0.25 an hour, or $4.20 in 2015 dollars. It began primarily as a skilled minimum wage, applied to industries such as mining, manufacturing and transportation. As it expanded to include jobs in the service industry, the minimum wage in effect became a wage floor for unskilled labor.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, again in 2015 dollars, the federal minimum wage has been as high as $10.90 an hour, in 1968, and as low as $3.93, in 1948. But the average federal minimum wage over its 80-year history in the U.S. has been $7.40 an hour, with a median of $7.33, both just slightly higher than the current federal standard of $7.25.\n\nToday, less than 3% of the hourly workforce earns the minimum wage. By contrast, a forthcoming analysis from Miami and Trinity University economists shows that a $15 minimum wage would cover 44% of the hourly workforce in 2020. An estimated 2.3 million jobs would be at risk of elimination, while skilled employees who already earn $15 an hour could find their efforts devalued.\n\nIn an unguarded moment in 2014, SEIU organizer Kendall Fells acknowledged that the labor union plucked the $15 number out of thin air: \u201cTen dollars was too low and $20 was too high, so we landed at $15.\u201d Not surprisingly, the handful of locales that have implemented this arbitrary standard have found it to be extremely disruptive. A 2017 analysis of more than a dozen cities in the San Francisco Bay Area from researchers at Harvard and Mathematica Policy Research found each $1 increase in the minimum wage was associated with a 14% increase in closures for median-rated restaurants.\n\nDemocrats claim the federal minimum wage and the people who earn it have been \u201cstuck\u201d since 2009. In fact, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the number and percentage of people earning the minimum has dropped every year since 2010. Today, thanks to a tight labor market and tax reform, thousands of employers, including Amazon, Target , McDonald\u2019s and Walmart , have voluntarily raised their base pay as high as $15 an hour\u2014without the government mandate labor groups swore was necessary.\n\nMr. Saltsman is managing director at the Employment Policies Institute, which receives support from businesses, foundations and individuals."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "The Editorial Board", "title": "Parsing the Gender Pay Gap", "description": "A new study suggests choices, not sexism, explain wage disparities.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/parsing-the-gender-pay-gap-1542917969", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CL504_3gap_SOC_20181121170500.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T20:19:31Z", "content": "Progressives claim that the pay difference between men and women is caused by sexism that government must redress.

But a new study offers compelling evidence that the choices and priorities of women account for much of the disparity.\n\nThe study examined data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority because it is a union shop with uniform hourly wages in which men and women adhere to the same rules and enjoy the same benefits. Workers are promoted based on seniority, not performance. Male and female workers of the same seniority have the same options for scheduling, routes, vacation and overtime. Under such rigid work rules, even a sexist boss or manager would have little ability to give men preferential treatment.\n\nPotomac Watch Podcast\n\nYet even at the Transportation Authority, female train and bus operators earned less than men. To explain why, Harvard economists Valentin Bolotnyy and Natalia Emanuel looked at time cards and scheduling from 2011 to 2017, also factoring in sex, age, date of hire, tenure, and whether an employee was married or had dependents.\n\nThey found that male train and bus operators worked about 83% more overtime hours than their female colleagues and were twice as likely to accept an overtime shift on short notice. About twice as many women as men never took overtime. The agency pays time and a half for overtime, so these choices have a significant effect on earnings.\n\nMale bus and train operators also took 48% fewer unpaid hours off under the Family Medical Leave Act each year. Female employees were disproportionately willing to take less preferable routes if it meant working fewer nights, weekends and holidays.\n\nParenting amplified the difference in priorities for male and female employees. More than childless colleagues, fathers wanted the extra cash from overtime, and mothers more time off. These choices were more pronounced among single parents. Unmarried mothers took 59% fewer last-minute overtime hours than did unmarried fathers.\n\nMr. Bolotnyy and Ms. Emanuel conclude that \u201cwomen, especially single women with children, value both time and the ability to avoid unplanned work much more than men.\u201d The study doesn\u2019t explore whether those decisions are motivated by personal preference or necessity, but even in a highly equitable workplace like the Massachusetts agency \u201cthese differences in choices\u201d are \u201cat the core of the gender earnings gap we observe,\u201d they write.\n\nThe study also looked at two policy changes that unintentionally narrowed the pay gap\u2014and found they made life tougher for female employees. In 2016 the Transportation Authority made it more difficult to take unpaid time off under the Family Medical Leave Act. The next year it redefined overtime from \u201cany time in excess of 8 hours worked in a day\u201d to \u201cany time worked in excess of 40 hours in a week,\u201d which made it harder for workers to game the system by working fewer hours but making the pay up with overtime.\n\nAs women took less unpaid time off and men earned less overtime, the pay gap narrowed from 89 cents on the dollar in 2015 to 92 cents in 2017. But all employees had less flexibility over work schedules. Even as their relative pay rose, some women began taking unexcused time off instead, which put them at risk of suspension or even termination.\n\nThe study ratifies the common-sense observation that men and women often have different priorities, and the best way to accommodate them is through the marketplace, not the untender mercies of government."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "The Editorial Board", "title": "A 'Military Option' for Sick Venezuelans", "description": "The USNS Comfort sets sail with aid for people fleeing a failed state.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-military-option-for-sick-venezuelans-1542917917", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CL476_2comfo_SOC_20181121143426.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T20:18:39Z", "content": "The U.S. Navy is sending a 900-foot ship to within about 50 miles of Venezuela, but this isnt a typical show of strength.

Two years ago, he launched his own wellness app called Jiyo, which helps users monitor their daily habits. He broadcasts Facebook and Instagram videos and posts every morning, using a camera on his dining room table.\n\nLong a believer in self-awareness as a path to spiritual enlightenment, he says that technology can expedite the journey. Lately, Mr. Chopra has been looking into the ways that health apps and virtual reality technology can not only help people track sleep, exercise and nutrition but also help treat conditions such as anorexia and depression. Watching oneself in virtual reality as a healthy person could \u201cpossibly rewire neural networks,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see yourself as a healthy person or you can see yourself as ideal weight.\u201d He grants that none of these techniques work so far, but he thinks that they will \u201cby the next generation.\u201d\n\nMr. Chopra says that his experience as a doctor in seeing the benefits of lifestyle changes and alternative treatments fueled his own embrace of them. Photo: Sally Montana Photography for The Wall Street Journal\n\nBorn in New Delhi, India, to a cardiologist father and homemaker mother, Mr. Chopra initially trained as a practitioner in traditional medicine. He went to medical school in New Delhi and moved to the U.S. in 1970 to take a job at a hospital in New Jersey. He worked at several hospitals in Boston and obtained his board certifications in internal medicine and endocrinology and metabolism. By 1980, he was chief of staff at the now-closed New England Memorial Hospital in Stoneham, Mass.\n\nAs an endocrinologist, he studied the emotional effects of dopamine, serotonin and other neurotransmitters. Back then, he says, his research connecting those chemicals with psychology was controversial, as was his belief in the efficacy of lifestyle and alternative treatments. \u201cThirty years ago we were suggesting these were molecules of emotion, and now that\u2019s accepted,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he left the hospital to branch out on his own, first running a meditation center and later co-founding the Chopra Center in 1996. He says that his experience as a doctor in seeing the benefits of lifestyle changes and alternative treatments fueled his own embrace of them. \u201cYou recognize you have two patients and they have the same illness\u2026but they have different outcomes,\u201d he says. \u201cThis person lives and this person dies, so for me that was the opening.\u201d He started writing books, hosting workshops and hiring researchers and employees to spread his gospel.\n\nToday, he picks up his iPhone to show the many apps that he uses to track his own health. He calls selfies \u201cwellfies\u201d and thinks that someday soon our devices will be able to diagnose our health issues just by looking at an image of our face and hearing the tone of our voice.\n\nHe lives in New York and San Diego, spending much of his time with his wife, two children and three grandchildren. He says that he spends most of his time thinking, practicing yoga for one hour a day and meditating for two hours. \u201cThese days I meditate on my death, because we all have to die,\u201d he says, but he\u2019s \u201cin very good health\u201d with what he says is a \u201cbiological age\u201d in his 40s.\n\nHis next book, \u201cMetahuman,\u201d which will be published next year, explores Mr. Chopra\u2019s belief that we are living in virtual reality, merely creating our experiences in our minds. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as the real reality,\u201d he says. \u201cThe universe is a human construct.\u201d He considers the body purely a perceptual experience too.\n\nBaffled, I ask if there\u2019s no reality, why people are motivated to write books or make money. \u201cMoney is a construct,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s been going on for thousands of years so it\u2019s our collective virtual reality.\u201d He quotes the Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein: \u201cWe are asleep. Our life is a dream. But we wake up sometimes, just enough to know that we are dreaming.\u201d\n\nI ask: If our lives are just a form of virtual reality, then what\u2019s the point of all the exercises in self-awareness, sleep tracking and yoga that he recommends? He smiles and says, \u201cSo when you\u2019re in the dream, you upgrade the dream.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": null, "title": "Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi: Was Carlos Ghosn Too Powerful?", "description": "The dramatic arrest of celebrity-CEO Carlos Ghosn is rocking the automotive industry.

The Pilgrims didn\u2019t have to travel enormous distances to see their loved ones; they lived right down the street. Nor did their Native American liaison Squanto and his preposterously accommodating brethren ever need to fly out of LaGuardia.\n\nMoreover, Thanksgiving can be fraught with bitter family tension. With politics now banned from the agenda at many family gatherings, the question is: What are the things that all of us\u2014 left or right, black or white, young or old, smart or really, really, dumb\u2014can agree to celebrate at this momentous November banquet? What are the things we can all be grateful for? Well, mostly all.\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\nWe don\u2019t have Putin. Okay, okay, you may not like the phalanx of poltroons and second-story men we have running this country. But our guys don\u2019t get rid of the opposition by sticking plutonium in their teacups. This is not something to be taken lightly. Every day you spend in a country that doesn\u2019t have Vladimir Putin in it is a great day. Especially if you like tea.\n\n\u201c Yeah, our kids are whiny and annoying. But compared to adults, they\u2019re a laugh a minute. \u201d\n\nVery few of us have to root for the Lions. As the result of a publicity stunt cooked up in days of yore, the Detroit Lions always play a football game right around lunchtime on Thanksgiving Day. Nobody cares. The Lions, who last won a championship when Richard Nixon was riding shotgun with Dwight D. Eisenhower, are usually appalling, as they are this year. If you live in or around Detroit, you are probably honor-bound to watch this game. Everyone else in the United States can sleep late.\n\nWe don\u2019t have Brexit. We don\u2019t even know what Brexit is. Neither do the Brits.\n\nTwenty-four hour diners. Take that, Estonia. Take that Burkina Faso. Take that, France.\n\nOur kids. Yeah, they\u2019re whiny. Yeah, they\u2019re entitled. Yeah, they\u2019re annoying. But compared to adults, they\u2019re a laugh a minute. If you\u2019ve got kids, even first-class jerks, be grateful for every second you get to spend with them. Well, maybe not if they insist on watching the Lions game because they\u2019ve got Matt Stafford on their Fantasy Football squad.\n\nBaseball season is finally over. Thank you, Higher Power. Thank you.\n\nThere is only one film about Robin Hood this year. As if that\u2019s not reassuring enough, there are no plans to make a biopic about REO Speedwagon or Weezer. Another positive: All plans to bring back Claire Foy as an abused, implausibly undersized, butt-kicking Swedish mega-hacker have now been put on hold.\n\nThe Canadians have got our back. Through thick and thin, come hell or high water, our patient, refreshingly sane neighbors to the north still like us. We mock them, we accuse them of practicing dairy industry gangsterism, we ridicule their daft national sport, but these guys never take it personally. The numbers don\u2019t lie: The Canadians are the best neighbors in the history of the world. Take that, Belgium. Take that, Liechtenstein. Take that, Nepal.\n\nDivas. Beyonce. Bette Midler.Lady Gaga. Streisand. Without our irrepressible divas we\u2019d be stuck with a bunch of preening clowns in megalithic ten-gallon hats who grew up in Dayton, Ohio. As anyone who saw Mamma Mia 2 will tell you, without Cher, life itself would not be worth living.\n\nThere are many other great things about living in this country that we should never take for granted. Musicals. Lipitor. Anything else? Sure. Social Security. The Rockies. Tony Bennett. Cranberry sauce. Samuel L. Jackson. Overnight free-shipping everywhere. Complimentary salad bar. The certainty that Tom Brady can\u2019t play forever, and neither can Steph Curry.\n\nOh yeah, one other thing to be happy about: Most of us don\u2019t live in Broward County.

Except that another Toledo native, Urban Meyer, is the coach of Ohio State, Michigan\u2019s archrival.\n\nDespite leading the Buckeyes to a national championship in 2015, Mr. Meyer has yet to receive the ceremonial key. As the teams head to their annual clash on Saturday, the glass trinket represents Mr. Harbaugh\u2019s lone triumph over Mr. Meyer, whose team has beaten Michigan all three times since Mr. Harbaugh became the Wolverines\u2019 coach.\n\n\u201cIt was like, \u2018Look at this SOB, I can\u2019t believe this, I\u2019m voting against him!\u2019\u201d Mr. Kapszukiewicz said, describing the reaction of Ohio State fans on social media.\n\nMaking matters worse, officials from the University of Toledo grumbled that if any football coach should receive a key to the city, it should be theirs.\n\n\u201cMy emotions exude disappointment,\u201d one University of Toledo trustee wrote in a scolding letter to the mayor. Giving Mr. Harbaugh the key \u201cwas a confusing gesture that embarrassed many people across the community.\u201d\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh, left, and Ohio State coach Urban Meyer following a game last November, which the Buckeyes won, 31-20. Photo: Tony Ding/Associated Press\n\nMr. Kapszukiewicz has been trying to navigate the politics of football fandom ever since. Following a peace summit with University of Toledo leaders, the school flag hangs from the front of his house.\n\nIn a bid to mollify Ohio State fans, he has also taken the rare step of publicly mocking the coach he honored. When presenting another key to Ohio congresswoman Marcy Kaptur in July, Mr. Kapszukiewicz cracked, \u201cI normally only give this to mediocre college football coaches.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Kapszukiewicz said the key presentation came at the request of a local group that provides legal services to the poor. Mr. Harbaugh\u2019s appearance at the group\u2019s spring dinner function helped raise more than $100,000.\n\n\u201cThis really wasn\u2019t about performance on the football field,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were, Jim Harbaugh wouldn\u2019t get one.\u201d He proceeded to recite a list of previous coaching jobs in which Mr. Harbaugh failed to win a championship, most recently with the San Francisco 49ers and Stanford, though he had winning records at both.\n\nMr. Kapszukiewicz, 47 years old, has a graduate degree from Michigan but said he roots for Ohio State.\n\nMr. Harbaugh, whose team is 10-1 this year and a national playoff contender, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment through a spokesman. Mr. Meyer, whose team is also 10-1 this year, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nToledo, just south of the Michigan line, has been at the heart of the Ohio State-Michigan \u201cborder war\u201d since it was an actual border war. The city was the subject of a territorial dispute in the early 1800s, with both states claiming it fell inside their federally approved boundaries.\n\nThe argument escalated into the Toledo War in 1835, which turned bloody when a Michigan sheriff ventured into a Toledo tavern to arrest an Ohio partisan named Two Stickney. Mr. Stickney stabbed the sheriff with a penknife, causing a minor wound.\n\nOhio won the dispute in 1836. Sixty-one years later, the states found a new outlet for violent confrontation: college football.\n\nOhio State\u2019s Terry McLaurin leapt for a pass above Michigan defender David Long last November. Photo: Gregory Shamus/Getty Images\n\nToledo\u2019s loyalties remain so split that a suburban store\u2014the Buckeye Wolverine Shop\u2014sells the clothing of both schools. Ohio State and Michigan items are displayed on opposite sides of the store. Families with split allegiances reunite at the checkout line, but are often reluctant to combine purchases.\n\n\u201cThey want them bagged separately so they don\u2019t touch,\u201d said Chris Mason, one of the store\u2019s owners.\n\nMessrs. Harbaugh and Meyer were not merely both born at the epicenter of the rivalry. They were born at the same Toledo hospital, just seven months apart in 1963 and 1964. Mr. Meyer grew up in Ashtabula, on the other side of Ohio. Mr. Harbaugh attended high school in Ann Arbor, Mich., near the University of Michigan, where he later played quarterback.\n\nStill, Mr. Harbaugh\u2014who has expressed a desire to recruit more players from Ohio\u2014regaled a crowd of hundreds at the legal aid group\u2019s dinner in May with his childhood memories.\n\n\u201cI rode my bike to school every day. It was great,\u201d he said, according to the Toledo Blade. He wore the cap of the local minor-league baseball team, the Toledo Mud Hens.\n\nMr. Kapszukiewicz presented him with a frame displaying the key, the first he had handed out as mayor.\n\nThe key itself, which signifies Toledo\u2019s history as a glass-manufacturing hub, has caused political faux pas before. While running for vice president in 1952, Richard Nixon thanked the city for awarding him \u201cthis beautiful plastic key,\u201d leaving local officials aghast.\n\nThe Harbaugh kerfuffle caught Mr. Kapszukiewicz by surprise. He was only vaguely aware of his unilateral power to award the keys when one was requested for the Michigan coach. His staff discovered a stash of around a dozen of them left over from the previous administration.\n\nThere are still more to be handed out, Mr. Kapszukiewicz said, should any other prominent Toledo natives return to raise money for charity.\n\n\u201cIf Urban Meyer wants to come to Toledo to do that,\u201d he said, \u201cI have a key right here for him, too.\u201d\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nThe last name of Ohio congresswoman Marcy Kaptur was incorrectly given as Kaptor in an earlier version of this article.

Gone are hundreds of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Sears and Bon-Ton department stores.\n\nThe disruption is delivering a silver lining to surviving chains, which are picking up business from displaced shoppers hunting for new places to find deals on toys, washing machines and clothes.\n\n\u201cThe shakeout in the retail space has been ongoing for many years,\u201d Best Buy Co. Chief Executive Hubert Joly said this week. \u201cWe see an increasing difference between the winners and losers.\u201d\n\nU.S. retailers have announced the closure of 5,468 stores this year through Nov. 16, according to Coresight Research. That compares with 6,765 closures during the same period in 2017, when familiar names like RadioShack and The Limited disappeared from American cities.\n\nRetailers from department-store chain Macy\u2019s Inc. to electronics specialist Best Buy Co. all pointed to the closing of competitors as one reason for the lift in their recent quarterly sales\u2014and an opportunity to capture new spending this holiday season.\n\nTo capture market share as Sears and others retreat, Best Buy said it has been expanding its appliances and improving its ability to deliver such products to homes. This year Best Buy also sent out toy catalogs and boosted its assortment of Barbies and Lego sets to win over shoppers that used to visit Toys \u201cR\u201d Us for holiday gifts. The big-box toy chain liquidated its U.S. business earlier this year, closing 881 stores.\n\n\u201cWhenever I go Black Friday shopping Toys \u2019R\u2019 Us was at the top of my list,\u201d said Maxine Dalada, 31, a technology consultant in Sacramento, Calif.\n\n\u201cMy kids and I talked about it,\u201d said the mother of two boys. \u201cI had to say \u2018Listen, we don\u2019t have a store like that anymore.\u2019 It\u2019s going to have to be Walmart or Target.\u201d\n\nMacy\u2019s said its Midwestern stores are getting a sales lift from the failure of Bon-Ton Stores , a regional chain that filed for bankruptcy and closed all its locations earlier this year. Macy\u2019s CEO Jeff Gennette said the company is targeting Bon-Ton shoppers with its marketing and hiring former Bon-Ton store managers and sales associates.\n\n\u201cWe believe approximately one-third of our store base is being favorably affected by department-store-competitor store closings,\u201d Bruce Besanko, the finance chief of Kohl\u2019s Corp. , told analysts on Tuesday when the company reported rising sales.\n\nEven J.C. Penney Co. , which has been struggling with losses and falling sales, said it was picking up business from the demise of Babies \u201cR\u201d Us, which was part of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. In a direct challenge to Sears, J.C. Penney reintroduced appliances two years ago, after exiting the category in 1983.\n\nAre You a Retail Worker? The WSJ wants to hear from people who work in retail and how their jobs have changed. Tell us here.\n\nWhile the shift to online shopping has had an effect, so have long-simmering competitive factors. Department stores, for instance, have been losing ground to fast-fashion retailers and discount chains for three decades. And even before the rise of Amazon.com Inc., a heavily indebted Toys \u201cR\u201d Us was struggling to hold its ground against Walmart Inc. and Target Corp.\n\nDespite the thousands of store closures in recent years, there are still too many brick-and-mortar stores in America, according to some retail executives, landlords and analysts. The U.S. has 23.6 square feet of retail space per capita, compared with 2.7 square feet for Europe, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.\n\nGap Inc. CEO Art Peck said he is looking at whether to close hundreds of Gap stores in locations that don\u2019t generate enough profits or foot traffic. He said some had deteriorated to the point where they were hurting the brand\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my strong belief that we\u2019ve kicked the can down the road on this,\u201d Mr. Peck told investors on Tuesday, \u201cand offered a deteriorating customer experience, and it does have a negative effect on the health of the brand.\u201d\n\nSears Holdings Corp. , which has closed hundreds of Sears and Kmarts in recent years, is liquidating about 200 more this holiday season after the long-struggling department store chain filed for bankruptcy protection in October. Earlier this year, Best Buy closed all 250 of its mobile-phone stores in the U.S., saying the smartphone market had matured and the smaller formats were more expensive to operate than its big boxes.\n\nEven as some chains have shut stores, others have opened them. So the net loss of capacity has been much less. According to Coresight, U.S. chains have announced 3,060 store openings so far this year in addition to 3,408 openings in 2017.\n\nDollar General Corp. has plans to open 900 stores this fiscal year. Other retailers that are expanding include Dollar Tree Stores Inc., supermarket chain Aldi, teen-retailer Five Below Inc., and Ulta Beauty Inc.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about having an equilibrium between closures and openings, and we are starting to see that gap close a bit,\u201d said Michael Brown, a partner in consulting firm A.T. Kearney\u2019s consumer products and retail practice.\n\nNot all retailers will benefit from the demise of competitors. Some experts are predicting a shakeout among chains adding toys to their lineup such as sporting-goods retailers and grocery stores.\n\n\u201cConsumers need to think of the retailer as an expert in the category for the share gains to be sustainable,\u201d said Rod Sides, the leader of Deloitte LLP\u2019s retail consulting practice. \u201cIt\u2019s likely some of the chains jumping into toys this year won\u2019t be there next year.\u201d\n\n\u2014Inti Pacheco contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com and Khadeeja Safdar at khadeeja.safdar@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Corinne Abrams", "title": "American's Fatal Missionary Trip Was a 'Misplaced Adventure,' Police Say - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal American's Fatal Missionary Trip Was a 'Misplaced Adventure,' Police Say Wall Street Journal The tribe that allegedly killed an American missionary on a remote Indian island has a long history of violent resistance to outsiders.

A number of veteran aviators, government safety officials and independent experts said the differences have sparked confusion within the aviation community.\n\nSome of the questions regulators, safety experts and pilots have addressed to Boeing and the airlines relate to a system that has been a focus of investigators since early in the probe. That system automatically pushes down the nose of an aircraft that is approaching an aerodynamic stall, a condition that occurs when a plane is flying dangerously slow with its nose too high, threatening a loss of lift.\n\nThe system that helps prevent Boeing\u2019s new 737 Max 8 plane from stalling is potentially linked to the fatal Lion Air jet crash in Indonesia. WSJ\u2019s Robert Wall explains what we know about the safety feature. Image: Getty\n\nSince the accident, some pilot-union leaders and others have publicly criticized Boeing for failing to highlight the operating principles, and potential hazards, of that system, known by the acronym MCAS.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has denied the company intentionally withheld information about the stall-prevention feature and said Boeing had described its relevant function in its manual. A spokesman added Boeing has discussed MCAS functions with more than 60 operators at several conferences around the world since 2016. The company has said it is working to fully understand what happened in the Lion Air crash.\n\nThe second automated feature, which hasn\u2019t previously been reported as part of the overall crash review, is intended to prevent cockpit crews from mistakenly further pulling up the nose of an aircraft that is already in a stall. That system, called elevator feel shift or EFS, is described differently in aircraft manuals used at Southwest Airlines , American Airlines and United Airlines, according to pilots, other safety experts and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has denied the company intentionally withheld information about the MCAS antistall feature. Photo: Richard Drew/Associated Press\n\nEFS uses hydraulic pressure to make it harder for pilots to pull back on the control yoke for a plane that is in a stall, as such a maneuver could make the problem worse. Descriptions of the amount of manual force required to overcome EFS commands and raise the nose under some conditions vary from manual to manual for older and newer 737 models. So does the language describing the EFS\u2019s hydraulic forces.\n\nIndonesian investigators have tentatively concluded the nose-down command function became activated on Lion Flight 610 before it plunged into the sea. It isn\u2019t clear whether the EFS function also became activated before the fatal dive.\n\nA spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, which is participating in the overall crash probe, declined to comment on the investigation\u2019s status or functions of the automated systems. He said the agency \u201cmay take further actions depending on the results of the investigation.\u201d\n\nAirline manuals are based on technical information and checklists provided by manufacturers such as Boeing but can be tailored for individual carriers. Federal regulators ultimately sign off on the contents.\n\nA Boeing spokesman didn\u2019t have any comment on specifics of the systems, how they are described in manuals or the latest focus of the crash probe. He said the company remains confident in the 737 MAX\u2019s safety.\n\nBoeing officials have so far refrained from publicly addressing questions or concerns raised privately by pilots and FAA officials about the EFS system. The Chicago-based plane maker also faces escalating criticism from some pilots and agency managers who say Boeing was too slow in providing important details.\n\nThese people question whether pilots may be confused about the exact circumstances when each automated system could kick in, and how the two may interact during certain types of emergencies.\n\nBoeing has faced criticism for not saying more publicly, including from a Wall Street analyst weighing the potential damage to the company\u2019s brand.\n\nData Error The Boeing 737 Max 8 features a new stall-prevention system that may have contributed to crash of Lion Air flight 610. Erroneous information sent from data probes to the plane's flight control system may have triggered a sharp descent. If the sensor reading shows the nose of the plane is rising too far, the automatic stall-prevention kicks in, pushing the nose down. But on the Lion Air flight, the faulty data may have activated the system even though the nose wasn't rising. Pilots would have had to quickly switch off the system to recover. Sources: Federal Aviation Administration; Indonesian crash investigators\n\n\u201cThere is too much silence coming from the company right now,\u201d CFRA Research stock analyst Jim Corridore said in an interview. \u201cWe all need to hear more from the company about why we shouldn\u2019t be worried.\u201d\n\nGordon Bethune, a former Boeing executive who oversaw development of an earlier 737 model and was later CEO of Continental Airlines, said the plane maker is likely being cautious in the interest of accuracy. Pilots should generally know about all the systems on aircraft they fly, he said, adding the situation appeared to involve \u201ca failure of communication.\u201d\n\nBut he said Boeing officials acted in good faith and didn\u2019t mean to keep pilots in the dark. \u201cThey didn\u2019t intentionally do it,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the company under heightened scrutiny, Boeing officials canceled a Tuesday conference call with airline officials meant to respond queries about the 737 MAX\u2019s automated features.\n\nA Boeing spokesman said the company was in close contact with customers and regulators, and was instead planning a series of sessions in different time zones with 737 operators to accommodate more attendees and questions.\n\nFlip the Switch Pulling back on the yoke won't stop a stall-prevention system in Boeing's new 737 MAX planes from pushing the nose down if it is getting bad sensor data. But turning off the system will. In Boeing's older 737 models, a common practice of pulling back on the control column (yoke) will stop cockpit systems from automatically pushing down the plane's nose. In Boeing's new 737 Max models, pulling back the yoke won't work if its stall- prevention system is getting faulty data from sensors. But an existing procedure works for both: pilots flip switches to keep the plane from pushing the nose down. Windshield Throttle quadrant Yoke Yoke Cutoff\n\nSouthwest, United and American are the only three U.S. carriers that operate the particularly fuel-efficient 737 MAX models, which are a small portion of the global fleet of thousands of workhorse twin-engine 737 jetliners.\n\nA Southwest spokeswoman said \u201cpilots are aware of and trained on stall identification and associated aircraft systems, including EFS.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for United Continental Holdings Inc. said that the 737 MAX is safe and that pilots are properly trained to fly it. An American Airlines Group Inc. spokesman said work with the FAA and Boeing is ongoing, and \u201cwe will continue to keep pilots informed of any updates.\u201d\n\nIndonesian investigators are expected to release a preliminary report in coming days. Boeing is expected to announce a software fix to the MCAS system before the end of the year, according to government and industry officials.\n\nDifferences in flight manuals also occur overseas. At least one European 737 MAX operator said it was briefed on the MCAS system before delivery of the plane. In regulatory documents, Brazilian authorities identified MCAS as a system that differs on the 737 MAX from earlier versions, but Canadian authorities didn\u2019t break it out separately.\n\n\u2014Robert Wall in London contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com and Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jess Bravin", "title": "Chief Justice Rebuts Trump's Attacks on Judges, and President Tweets Back", "description": "President Trump and Chief Justice John Roberts engaged in an extraordinary debate over the independence of federal courts, issuing dueling statements that publicly exposed the judiciary\u2019s long-simmering distress with Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the legal system.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chief-justice-roberts-rebuts-trumps-attacks-on-judges-1542827385", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38355/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T03:28:13Z", "content": "WASHINGTONPresident Trump and Chief Justice John Roberts engaged in an extraordinary debate Wednesday over the independence of federal courts, issuing dueling statements that publicly exposed the judiciarys long simmering distress with Mr. Trumps attacks on t\u2026 [+5010 chars]", "fulltext": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump and Chief Justice John Roberts engaged in an extraordinary debate Wednesday over the independence of federal courts, issuing dueling statements that publicly exposed the judiciary\u2019s long simmering distress with Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the legal system.\n\nFor years, Chief Justice Roberts remained silent as Mr. Trump goaded the judiciary with tweets on individual judges and cast aspersions that political agendas rather than legal reasoning had prompted courts to rule against him.\n\n..."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Becky Yerak", "title": "Bankrupt iHEARTMEDIA Wants to Pay Top Brass Up to $33 Million in Bonuses...", "description": "Bankrupt iHEARTMEDIA Wants to Pay Top Brass Up to $33 Million in Bonuses...

But the growing use of air conditioning among India\u2019s 1.3 billion people is among its biggest energy problems. Demand also is rising across other developing countries, where climates tend to be hot and incomes and populations are growing. That puts India at the epicenter of a global conundrum: How to accommodate the escalating needs for electricity without setting off an unsustainable tidal wave of energy use?\n\nA cadre of Indian bureaucrats is pursuing one of the most promising responses: more-efficient air conditioners. Energy efficiency is the unsexy side of the world\u2019s energy debate. It gets little attention compared to efforts to install solar and wind farms. It is particularly critical in the developing world, where most of the energy growth over the next generation will take place. Developing countries, which consumed less than half the world\u2019s energy in 2000, now account for 58%, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency. By the year 2040 they will account for 67%, the IEA projects.\n\nIn these countries\u2014especially populous nations such as India and Indonesia\u2014most of the homes, offices and public buildings where energy will be consumed in 2030 have yet to be built. With an emphasis on energy efficiency, there are huge savings to be had not only in future energy consumption, but also in greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of energy generation and transmission infrastructure that needs to be built.\n\n\u201c Electricity consumption from air conditioning in India is expected to multiply 30 times from 2010 to 2030 if it isn\u2019t made more efficient. \u201d\n\nA lot of the growth, and therefore potential savings, is in air conditioning. The 900 million residential air conditioners in the world today are expected to rise to between 2.5 billion and 3.7 billion room units by 2050. If little is done to improve efficiency, air conditioning will account for 40% of global growth in energy consumed in buildings by 2050\u2014an amount of energy equivalent to all the electricity used today in the U.S. and Germany combined, according to the IEA. \u201cBusiness as usual is really, really scary,\u201d says Iain Campbell, a longtime executive with air conditioner manufacturers who is now a senior fellow at the Rocky Mountain Institute.\n\nIndia is already the world\u2019s fastest growing market for air conditioners. By 2050, the IEA projects it will be the largest. There\u2019s likely to be no stopping Indians from buying air conditioners; as China\u2019s middle class emerged between 1992 and 2007, homes with air conditioning in many urban areas went from approximately zero to nearly 100%. What could change is the amount of energy those air conditioners use, if more efficient versions become the norm.\n\nAnnual electricity consumption from air conditioning in India is expected to multiply 30 times from just eight terawatt hours in 2010 to 239 terawatt hours by 2030 without more intensive efforts to improve their efficiency, according to a study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That would equal about one-seventh of India\u2019s total annual energy load today, but the real threat is peak-time usage. Air conditioners would take up half of India\u2019s expected peak capacity at that point if they don\u2019t become more efficient. Increasing the efficiency\u2014and thus the annual load and the peak demand\u2014by 40% would avoid the need to build the equivalent of more than 100 new coal-fired power plants of 500 megawatts each, according to the study.\n\nAs part of India\u2019s effort to convert the country to power-saving LED bulbs, U.S.-born Meera Vashisht distributed free bulbs in New Delhi in July 2016. The bulbs were bought with funds raised in the U.S. Photo: AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor precedent, India had surprising energy-savings success with another electricity-guzzling fixture of modern life: the light bulb. In lighting, by promoting use of high-efficiency bulbs through bulk purchasing, Indian energy officials pushed manufacturers to drive down bulb prices by more than 90%. In turn, the availability of cheaper bulbs in that large a market helped encourage a global switch to more energy-lean LED bulbs.\n\nThe light-bulb effort began five years ago when a former tax department official named Saurabh Kumar went to work for an arm of the Indian government called Energy Efficiency Services Ltd. He convinced the tiny state of Puducherry to order 600,000 high-efficiency, long-lasting bulbs with a plan to sell them to consumers for 10 rupees (about 14 cents) upfront and 10 more rupees each month for 10 years added to their electricity bill. EESL fronted the bulk purchase, to be paid back over the decade life of the program. Then in October 2014, the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh was devastated by a cyclone, and every streetlight in its largest city, Visakhapatnam, needed replacing. EESL installed 90,000 new high-efficiency street lights in just weeks, and soon Andhra Pradesh and other states were ordering tens of millions more of the bulbs. The price, once 500 rupees, dropped to as little as 38 rupees per bulb through the EESL\u2019s programs. In the private market, bulb prices dropped almost as much.\n\nTo date, about one billion high-efficiency light bulbs have been sold in India \u2014close to one for every person\u2014accounting for 12% of the global demand for LED bulbs, according to Mr. Kumar. The Indian government pegs its savings on electricity for light bulbs at 41 terawatt hours per year, or the equivalent of what 4 million homes in the U.S. use.\n\nPushing this many bulbs into the market that fast once seemed as daunting as the colossal challenge of air conditioning seems today. EESL, which has grown from just a dozen employees to 1,200, is aiming to achieve the same virtuous cycle. But air conditioners are much bigger purchases than a light bulb; the highest-efficiency models hover between 31,000 and 35,000 rupees.\n\nIn 2016, EESL started a pilot program approaching banks, which use air conditioners to keep their ATMs from overheating, using the same bulk-purchase strategy paid back from electricity savings. Then the agency began replacing 50,000 air conditioners in 6,000 government buildings. Now EESL is working with companies such as Mahindra Automotive, which has ordered 1,100 of the super-high efficiency air conditioners to replace aging units in its offices. The company expects a 15%-30% energy savings over the next 18 months, according to Vijay Kalra, CEO of the company. \u201cWe want to do it as fast as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether EESL can drive down the price of super-efficient air conditioners as far as it did with high-efficiency lighting. Unlike with light bulbs, ACs are considered a luxury item for the rich, one governments are wary of being seen as directly subsidizing. EESL is looking into arranging financing plans and getting manufacturers to build units designed specifically to raise efficiency in India\u2019s unusually high humidity. Still, companies and consumers are increasingly receptive to the idea that efficiency can lead to savings, in part because they saw the success of the light bulbs. \u201cBefore this,\u201d says EESL head Mr. Kumar, \u201cenergy efficiency was a foreign idea for them.\u201d\n\n\u2014Vibhuti Agarwal contributed to this article\n\nWrite to Bill Spindle at bill.spindle@wsj.com and Russell Gold at russell.gold@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Paul Vieira", "title": "Canada Unveils Tax Incentives", "description": "Canada revealed billions in economic measures aimed at jump-starting lackluster business spending and countering the risk of lost investment to the U.S.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-unveils-tax-incentives-to-offset-trump-effect-1542837471", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38407/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T02:41:11Z", "content": "OTTAWACanada on Wednesday unveiled billions in economic measures aimed at jump-starting lackluster business spending and countering the risk of lost investment to the U.S. stemming from the Trump administrations tax reform.

The last time GE shares got this low was at the depth of the financial crisis when there was a real chance that its huge financial arm, GE Capital, would bring down the whole enterprise. Investors willing to take that risk could at one point snap up its valuable industrial operations for free.\n\nIndustrial companies don\u2019t implode the way financial firms do. So, despite the 40% selloff in the past month, the chances of catastrophe at the largely industrial GE are much less likely.\n\nThe odds of a bankruptcy recently topped 15% if credit-default-swap prices were to be believed. On the other hand, GE\u2019s industrial operations are now a mixed bag\u2014booming aviation and health care units, a listed oil-and-gas unit trading near multiyear lows and a horror show in its largest unit, power.\n\nIt is little wonder that optimists who saw the glass as at least 85% full have been burned by abortive rallies. Just seven weeks ago, there was a 21% gain in six trading sessions topping out at $13.61 a share on optimism over Chief Executive Larry Culp\u2019s appointment. GE shares closed Friday at $7.57.\n\nBuying GE because you think its shares are destined to return to that last, or any other recent high, is a mistake. This is called anchoring and it is one of the psychological foibles that part fools from their money. The rational approach is to value GE as a going concern, acknowledging that there is at least a small chance of losing everything. If you like your odds, then buy it.\n\nIt is never easy to pull the trigger on a beaten-up stock. GE requires even more fortitude. Government investigations into its accounting, a massive write-down in its power division and the possibility it will have to pour more cash into its discontinued long-term-care insurance operation are just the known unknowns. While its debt isn\u2019t rated junk, it trades like it is\u2014hence the elevated price of credit default swaps.\n\nImagination at Work Sum-of-the parts valuation of GE based on peer groups, dollars a share Power $6.59 a share Aviation 4.68 Healthcare 4.39 Baker Hughes 3.35 Renewables 1.38 Transportation 1.13 Lighting 0.19 Finance less debt -3.15 Net industrial debt -4.64 Other* -2.07 Tuesday share price: $11.84 Sum of the parts $7.65\n\nNew York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran, who literally wrote the book on valuation, recently used two different approaches that rely on each of GE\u2019s division\u2019s past operating income and the multiples of close peers to arrive at per-share values of $11.84 or $10.92 a share. It was an exercise not without frustration.\n\n\u201cI have always described my vision of hell as having to value GE over and over and over again, for eternity,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBuying GE based only on its past accounting earnings, now under investigation, could have fairly hellish results if it turns out they were overstated. An alternative to Mr. Damodaran\u2019s approach is to focus on cash, which is harder to fudge. GE\u2019s free-cash-flow margin since 2000, a period encompassing two deep recessions, has averaged 11.2%. Plug in actual analyst cash-flow forecasts for the next two years and apply the historical margin to GE\u2019s revenue from 2021 onward, assuming sales just grow in line with the economy. Discount those cash flows and subtract liabilities such as GE\u2019s pension deficit, net debt and a further $15 billion contribution to long-term-care insurance produces a value per share of $19.42. GE fetched as much a little over a year ago.\n\nBut that is still optimistic. One reason is that before the last recession, high-margin businesses like entertainment and finance combined for nearly half of GE\u2019s revenue. Last year, that was just 7%. Meanwhile, GE management can\u2019t pin down when its biggest division, power, will turn around. Finally, a long-term cash-flow valuation is pretty useless for a company that goes bust in the short term.\n\nThere is no easy way to account for all of that except to build in a margin of safety. One approach would be to assign equal odds to the company going bankrupt or earning its historical free-cash-flow margin\u201415% each\u2014and placing 70% odds on it earning just three-quarters of its historical free-cash-flow margin. On a probability-weighted basis, the stock should be worth $10.90 or 42% more than it is today.\n\nValuation is as much art as science. Faulty assumptions in a financial model, as analysts say, equals \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d Even so, there is reason to believe that there is treasure to be found in this corporate dumpster fire.\n\nWrite to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Bojan Pancevski", "title": "U.S. Weighs Inviting German Auto CEOs to White House to Press for More U.S. Production", "description": "The Trump administration is considering inviting the CEOs of Germany\u2019s three largest car makers to the White House amid growing impatience in Washington at the slow pace of trade talks with the EU.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-weighs-inviting-german-auto-ceos-to-white-house-to-press-for-more-u-s-based-production-1542825899", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38350/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T00:45:52Z", "content": "BERLINThe Trump administration is considering inviting the CEOs of Germanys three largest car makers to the White House amid growing impatience in Washington at the slow pace of talks with the European Union on forging a trans-Atlantic trade deal, according t\u2026 [+3194 chars]", "fulltext": "BERLIN\u2014The Trump administration is considering inviting the CEOs of Germany\u2019s three largest car makers to the White House amid growing impatience in Washington at the slow pace of talks with the European Union on forging a trans-Atlantic trade deal, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe chief executives of Volkswagen AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG could meet with Chief White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer within days, according..."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Matthew Kitchen", "title": "Passwords Aren't Enough.
