Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, likely chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has indicated he\u2019s not going the let the biggest sleeping dog of the 2016 race lie.\n\n\u201cTotally,\u201d he told CNN when asked whether he would probe FBI actions during the campaign. \u201cThe oversight function will be very much front and center.\u201d\n\nOn the Democratic side, Rep. Adam Schiff told the Los Angeles Times that his first goal is to restore \u201ccomity\u201d to his own fractious House Intelligence Committee. (Presumably the Times reporter didn\u2019t mishear the word \u201ccomedy.\u201d) Less felicitously, Mr. Schiff added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be defending the independence of the Justice Department,\u201d by which he meant protecting special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired by President Trump.\n\nExcept the Mueller investigation is expected to wrap up soon, and it appears to have found nothing particularly exciting. Meanwhile, Mr. Schiff has finally shown some interest in the truly explosive unfinished business of 2016. He told the New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer that if former FBI chief James Comey\u2019s account of his actions during the 2016 race is accurate, then his intervention likely represents the \u201cmost measurable\u201d and \u201cmost significant way in which the Russians may have impacted the outcome of the election.\u201d\n\nMr. Schiff\u2019s acknowledgment is especially interesting because, unlike the rest of us, he would have seen a classified Justice Department report on this episode, which remains withheld from the public.\n\nMr. Comey, we now know, was acting on dubious, possibly planted Russian intelligence when he intervened in the Hillary Clinton email matter. He was acting from a counterintelligence motive (he was worried about a Russian effort to discredit Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory), not the criminal investigatory motive he pretended at the time. In adopting this spy vs. spy rationale, he surely would have consulted with his Obama administration colleagues, CIA Director John Brennan and National Intelligence Director James Clapper.\n\nAnd when Mr. Comey intervened a second time, reopening the investigation days before the election, he did so to protect the credibility of the original operation. This step, even Mr. Comey now concedes, may have tipped the Electoral College to Mr. Trump.\n\nAll this the press now ignores. When Mr. Comey, for public consumption, claimed in early 2017 that it was the Bill Clinton-Loretta Lynch tarmac meeting that triggered his intervention, the Washington Post thundered on its homepage, \u201cNow we know: Bill Clinton cost his wife the presidency.\u201d\n\nSince the truth came out, no headline has appeared proclaiming, \u201cNow we know: Trump\u2019s victory was the product of an intelligence operation that went wrong.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s own critical report on Mr. Comey\u2019s actions refers 17 times to a \u201cclassified appendix\u201d addressing these matters. Existence of this classified appendix has gone virtually unmentioned in the media.\n\nThe department\u2019s own inspector general voiced dissatisfaction that the information is being kept from the American people. His words went unreported in the press. In Senate testimony, he plainly stated that he had entreated the \u201cdeputy attorney general\u201d (presumably Rod Rosenstein) \u201cto go back to the intelligence community and let us know how we can address whatever caused this to be classified at that high level.\u201d\n\nUnfortunate, given the abdication of the media, is the lack of any other institutional champion for getting at the truth. Mr. Trump, however impressive his accomplishment in 2016, doesn\u2019t wish to hear that the FBI\u2019s opportunistic use of questionable Russian intel may have pushed him over the top. Messrs. Comey, Brennan and Clapper don\u2019t want investigation of actions that were clearly colored by contempt for Mr. Trump and a desire that Mrs. Clinton be elected. About this there\u2019s no doubt: All three men have openly vented their contempt since the election, plus we have the contemporaneous text messages of Mr. Comey\u2019s key counterintelligence deputy, Peter Strozk.\n\nYou would have to be a dope, moreover, not to suspect that, since Election Day, much of the mau-mauing of Mr. Trump by ex-intelligence officials has been meant to keep the focus off their own behavior. Whether you regard Mr. Comey\u2019s actions as legitimate or illegitimate, they were hugely consequential\u2014magnitudes more consequential than the trivial Facebook messages that people keep going on about. Which makes even more curious the press\u2019s lack of interest in this story.\n\nJust eyeballing it, most media professionals seem to consider the 2016 outcome a travesty yet avert their eyes from its decisive intrigue. At best, the press prefers to treat the whole matter as one man\u2019s whim (i.e., Mr. Comey\u2019s) despite mounting evidence that it would be better characterized as a counterintelligence scheme gone awry."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Paulo Trevisani", "title": "Brazil Signals Hawkish Approach on Its Big Budget Deficit", "description": "Brazil\u2019s president-elect has put together a team of fiscal hawks to lead the economy, winning cautious approval from markets worried about the country\u2019s ballooning debt.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-signals-hawkish-approach-on-its-big-budget-deficit-1542387732", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CK337_brazec_SOC_20181116111620.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:45:15Z", "content": "BRAS\u00cdLIABrazils president-elect has put together a team of fiscal hawks to lead the economy, winning cautious approval from markets worried about the countrys ballooning debt.

So its a good time to ask what weve learnedespecially about the causes\u2026 [+10026 chars]", "fulltext": "Basel, Switzerland\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough decade for most developed economies, as businesses, politicians, policy makers and voters have struggled with the aftermath of a global financial panic and deep recession. So it\u2019s a good time to ask what we\u2019ve learned\u2014especially about the causes and cures of the financial instability that caused so many problems. Claudio Borio\u2019s answer is sobering: We know less than we think we do, and our ignorance could cost us.\n\nMr. Borio is worth heeding from his unique perch running the economic-research department at the Bank for International Settlements. The BIS is an informational clearinghouse for the world\u2019s central banks, providing data, convening meetings, and guiding debates on financial regulation. So he can draw on the practical insights that come from extensive contacts with policy makers\u2014a distinct advantage over many academic economists. But in contrast to economists who\u2019ve served in governments, Mr. Borio is not politically invested in one policy choice or another.\n\nThat allows him to start our conversation on a crisp autumn morning with a startling observation: \u201cThe state of knowledge is that we\u2019re all struggling!\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t mean that as a criticism of central banks, which, Mr. Borio says, acted quickly and correctly 10 years ago to stabilize the financial system. \u201cThe response to the crisis worked very well,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was central banks pulling out all the stops and coordinating with each other. That helped at preventing the situation from running completely out of the control, stabilizing the financial system, stabilizing the economy,\u201d and staving off a depression.\n\nThe problem is that politicians have come to rely too heavily on central banks to stimulate growth since the crisis. Mr. Borio describes the institutions as \u201coverburdened.\u201d At the same time, central banks are constrained by economic theories that offer little meaningful guidance for how to sustain growth and financial stability.\n\nHere, broadly, is what mainstream monetary economists think they know: Inflation, employment and economic growth change in relation to each other in predictable ways. The central relationship between inflation and employment is described by a concept called the Phillips curve: As unemployment falls, inflation rises. The theory has been poked and prodded, bashed and battered since it was first proposed in the 1950s, but all variations share the belief that deflation is a result of economic slack.\n\nCentral banks can\u2019t tolerate deflation because it signifies slower-than-natural growth in which too few people have jobs. Yet they have limited scope to influence the economy, according to the dominant theory. Over the longer term, financial, product and labor markets find their own equilibriums. Central banks can provide only limited jolts by tweaking short-term interest rates.\n\nMr. Borio thinks there\u2019s a better approach. \u201cMonetary policy has been reduced to very, very simple relationships that are built on a system that is self-equilibrating,\u201d independent of anything central banks do. \u201cFinancial factors don\u2019t really fit into it, and therefore monetary factors don\u2019t really fit into it. The only thing you really have is an interest rate, for instance, that in the short run may affect output but in the long run ends up affecting only inflation.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the dominant theories of monetary economics omit the most interesting, and important, consequences of monetary policy. When this model \u201ctalks about financial aspects like the financial system,\u201d he says, \u201cthe only thing the financial system does is to allocate resources, given resources.\u201d Yet financial systems also create resources by extending credit in response to monetary-policy incentives.\n\nNor can one elide the question of exactly how those resources are distributed. At the heart of Mr. Borio\u2019s work is an insight most contemporary theorists miss: One needs to examine \u201chow resources are allocated across different sectors in ways that may not be optimal.\u201d It\u2019s very different from the orthodox view that a rising tide of new money lifts all boats.\n\nWith that point in mind, economists need to go back to the drawing board. Another way of thinking about the breakdown of the Phillips curve \u201cis that there may be longer-term structural forces that are in play here,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd personally, I\u2019ve always felt that the way in which structural forces may actually be reflected in the failure of the Phillips curve to work has not been given the attention it deserves.\u201d The big structural force Mr. Borio identifies is globalization, under which international competition puts sustained downward pressure on inflation.\n\nSimilar observations underlie the next big thing in monetary orthodoxy: \u201csecular stagnation.\u201d A 1930s-era Keynesian theory dusted off in late 2013 by Harvard economist and former Obama adviser Larry Summers as an explanation for the slow recovery, secular stagnation has gained academic currency as a way to revise the Phillips curve by incorporating more variables. Aging populations are consuming less and productivity is growing more slowly, the argument goes, leading to a sustained period of slack demand. But Mr. Borio interprets \u201cstructural forces\u201d differently. The main drivers of deflation at the moment \u201care good forces,\u201d he says. \u201cThey improve the capacity of the economy to produce and boost growth. Think of it as a benign increase in supply.\u201d\n\nIn a 2015 paper Mr. Borio and colleagues examined 140 years of data from 38 countries and concluded that consumer-price deflation frequently coincides with healthy economic growth. If he\u2019s right, central banks have spent years fighting disinflation or deflation when they shouldn\u2019t have, and in the process they\u2019ve endangered the economy more than they realize.\n\n\u201cBy keeping interest rates very, very, very low,\u201d he warns, \u201cyou are contributing to the buildup of risks in the financial system through excessive credit growth, through excessive increases in asset prices, that at some point have to correct themselves. So what you have is a financial boom that necessarily at some point will turn into a bust because things have to adjust.\u201d\n\nHe describes this as a \u201cpincer movement\u201d in a working paper he wrote with several colleagues this year. On one hand, globalization and other (often benign) factors make it harder for central banks to gin up inflation by cutting interest rates. On the other hand, by slashing rates in pursuit of that hard-to-attain inflation target, they create imbalances in the financial system that lead to crises like the one in 2008.\n\nIt\u2019s not that other economists are blind to financial instability. They\u2019re just strangely unconcerned about it. \u201cThere are a number of proponents of secular stagnation who acknowledge, very explicitly, that low interest rates create problems for the future because they\u2019re generating all these financial booms and busts,\u201d Mr. Borio says. Yet they still believe central banks must set ultralow short-term rates to support economic growth\u2014and if that destabilizes the financial system, it\u2019s the will of the economic gods.\n\nMr. Borio thinks monetary economists and central bankers need to take more responsibility\u2014that especially after 2008, such indifference to financial markets ought to discredit an economic theory. If economists think \u201cstructural forces\u201d dictate policies that destabilize financial markets, that should be a clue that they misunderstand the forces in play: \u201cHow could financial and macroeconomic stability be in tension?\u201d\n\nThe financial panic caught experts by surprise because they had assumed that the financial system (and the economy as a whole) would, through the inscrutable workings of the invisible hand, find a sustainable balance of saving, investment, consumption and other variables independent of central-bank policies.\n\nMr. Borio, in contrast, can explain exactly where dangerous financial imbalances come from: the incentives policy makers accidentally create for bad decisions on Main Street about borrowing and investment. The misallocation of resources during the booms requires a prolonged and miserable process of reallocation during and after a recession.\n\nWe should expect any serious monetary theory to explain a financial crisis, Mr. Borio insists. The only time he sounds genuinely dismissive of conventional wisdom during our conversation is on this point: \u201cYou know, in many of these models, how do they explain the Great Financial Crisis? They explain it as a meteorite coming from nowhere\u2014it\u2019s an exogenous shock, it\u2019s productivity that all of a sudden for some unexplained reason collapsed, or people all of a sudden decided to save more, but without an explanation. In my most cynical moments, I say \u2018shocks\u2019 are a measure of our ignorance, not a measure of our knowledge.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s a central banker to do? \u201cI think that if I were a policy maker actually in charge of making policy, I would find it extremely challenging,\u201d Mr. Borio says puckishly before offering a few ideas:\n\nAbove all, \u201cit\u2019s important to be thinking of these things all the time.\u201d Policy makers should keep a constantly watchful eye on financial conditions, not only in the depth of a crisis or the height of a worrisome bubble. The problem comes when \u201c95% of the time you carry out your policy as if these factors didn\u2019t matter, and then when you see that the economy is running red hot and you see obvious signs of financial imbalances, you start moving.\u201d\n\nCentral banks and other authorities have tended to approach financial stability from a regulatory perspective, and this is the thrust of the high-profile Basel standards the Bank for International Settlements has helped craft. Mr. Borio says this is necessary but far from sufficient. There\u2019s a limit to how successfully such rules can row against the broader policy tide. The entire monetary-policy framework needs to be reoriented toward financial stability.\n\nMr. Borio\u2019s work amounts to an argument that monetary economists need to acknowledge how little they know about the economies they seek to manage. Central bankers themselves have grown more modest over the past decade. If only more economists shared the maestros\u2019 appreciation for the limitations of current theories and the need to rethink them.\n\nMr. Sternberg, a London-based member of the Journal\u2019s editorial board, is writing a book on millennials in the post-2008 economy."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Tunku Varadarajan", "title": "A Mayor Seeks to Stymie His City's Only Successful School", "description": "In struggling New Bedford, Mass., the Alma del Mar charter faces opposition to its expansion plan.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-mayor-seeks-to-stymie-his-citys-only-successful-school-1542411672", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CK040_CCTunk_SOC_20181115145846.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:41:13Z", "content": "New Bedford, Mass.

The names on the bulletin board of a kindergarten classroom reveal the notably Hispanic demographics of Alma del Mar, a K-8 charter public school in this blighted city that was once America\u2019s foremost whaling port. In fact, the majority of the school\u2019s kindergarten is comprised of students whose first language is Spanish. By the time they get to first or second grade, many will speak better English than their parents.\n\nHoused in a sprawling new building, the school\u2019s interior is a clean, hushed hive of industrious students and teachers. There is no obvious indiscipline, no unruly children bouncing off the walls. At the playground outside, students hop off monkey-bars and swings to greet the principal, who accompanies me on a tour of the school. She greets them back by name.\n\nAlma del Mar (which means \u201csoul of the sea\u201d) is a success story in a city that badly needed one. Started in August 2011, it now has 446 children on its rolls\u2014and even more than that on a waiting list, clamoring to be admitted. There is a lottery every year, explains Kaitlin Goldrick, the school\u2019s 30-year-old principal. Every child at Alma del Mar \u201cis here because their families want them here,\u201d she says. \u201cThe lottery can be a heartbreaking night,\u201d says Ms. Goldrick. \u201cThere are families that enter the lottery year after year, and never get in.\u201d\n\nFamilies are drawn to Alma del Mar\u2019s record as well as its optimistic spirit. \u201cThey want their children to get a good, serious education, and they know they\u2019ll get it here,\u201d says Ms. Goldrick. That seriousness is evident in the almost obsessive insistence at the school that its students be referred to as \u201cscholars.\u201d On a three-hour visit there I heard a teacher say \u201cstudents\u201d only once\u2014followed by a sheepish \u201cOops, I mean scholars.\u201d\n\nThe majority of New Bedford\u2019s students must endure dysfunctional district schools that are among the worst in terms of performance in all of Massachusetts. By contrast, says Will Gardner, Alma del Mar\u2019s founder and executive director, \u201cour third-graders performed last year at the same level as a third-grader in Wellesley on the state\u2019s test in math.\u201d (Wellesley is among the most affluent suburbs in Massachusetts.)\n\nFor all its success, Alma del Mar is embroiled in local controversy. In August, the school applied to the state to get 1,188 more seats for students, the entire quota for new charter seats for the school district of New Bedford. (Massachusetts, like many other states, puts caps on the numbers of students in charter schools.) The school aims to add two new campuses, one next year and another in 2020. Yet the city\u2019s mayor, Jon Mitchell, has declared he will fight Alma del Mar\u2019s expansion.\n\n\u201cI intend to oppose it,\u201d the mayor said recently, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t believe that this is the right thing for the city.\u201d He added, without supporting evidence, that Alma del Mar \u201chas demonstrated itself not to be a constructive partner with the school district.\u201d A recent article in CommonWealth magazine by supporters of the mayor and the teachers union criticized Alma del Mar for getting political support from \u201cthe think-tank crowd\u201d\u2014a reference to the Boston-based free-market Pioneer Institute, which has promoted the school.\n\nAt the root of the resistance, supporters believe, is a panic in the mayor\u2019s office about relinquishing control over education in the city. Alma del Mar reports directly to the state, not to the city\u2019s elected school committee. There are competing petitions online\u2014one for and one against the school\u2019s expansion.\n\nThe state will rule on Alma del Mar\u2019s application in February, but the opposition to her school leaves Ms. Goldrick more perplexed than indignant. Speaking of opponents of the expansion, she says, \u201cTheir perspective is that they want all of the money to go to the district, because they feel, \u2018How can we get better if we aren\u2019t getting the money we deserve?\u2019 They say they need time to get better, and that charter schools make it harder for that to happen.\u201d (Each student at Alma del Mar brings state funding with him, subtracted from the district\u2019s share of state aid. Massachusetts is required to compensate the district.)\n\n\u201cMy response to this,\u201d says Ms. Goldrick, \u201cis, \u2018Why should these families have to wait for things to get better?\u2019 For our families, New Bedford is a failing school district. So if something doesn\u2019t change, why should a child have to wait 10 or 15, or who knows how many, years? By then they\u2019ll be out of school.\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d she adds, \u201cisn\u2019t it important that our families\u2014and all the families in New Bedford\u2014have a choice?\u201d\n\nMr. Varadarajan is executive editor at the Hoover Institution."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Heather Mac Donald", "title": "Sorry, Feminists, Men Are Better at Scrabble", "description": "Nothing stops women from competing at the game\u2019s highest levels, but almost none of them do.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sorry-feminists-men-are-better-at-scrabble-1542411642", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37012/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:40:44Z", "content": "The 2018 World Scrabble Championship was held last month in London.

This was Mr. Richards\u2019s fourth world title in English Scrabble; he also took the French Scrabble title this year for the second time, even though he doesn\u2019t speak French.\n\nIf Mr. Richards\u2019s dominance of competitive Scrabble is clear, there is a less noticed but more significant pattern in the game: Since the World Scrabble Championship began in 1991, all winners have been male. The North American Scrabble Championship has had one female winner (in 1987) since its founding in 1978. All eight finalists in this year\u2019s French World Scrabble Championships were men.\n\nCompetitive Scrabble constitutes a natural experiment for testing the feminist worldview. According to feminist dogma, males and females are identical in their aptitudes and interests. If men dominate certain data-based, abstract fields like engineering, physics and math, that imbalance must, by definition, be the result of sexism\u2014whether a patriarchal culture that discourages girls from math or implicit bias in the hiring process.\n\nBut there are no cultural expectations that discourage females from memorizing dictionaries\u2014a typical strategy of competitive Scrabble players, often in a foreign language that the player doesn\u2019t speak. Girls are as free as boys to lap up vocabulary. Nor are there misogynist gatekeepers to keep females out of Scrabble play; the game, usually first learned at home, is open to all. According to Hasbro , 83% of recreational Scrabble players 25 to 54 are female.\n\nChampionship Scrabble, however, rewards typically male obsessions: strategy, math, a passion for competition, and a drive to memorize facts. Mr. Richards\u2019s mother told the Guardian in 2015 that he \u201crelated everything to numbers\u201d when he was growing up. Feminists will need to employ circular logic to conjure forth a discriminatory barrier in Scrabble: Males\u2019 excellence at a certain activity itself keeps females out. But that leaves unanswered the question of how males came to excel at Scrabble\u2014or any other abstract, competitive activity\u2014in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, the feminist explanation for sex disparities in science, technology, engineering and math has spread to countless public and private institutions. The prestigious National Academy of Sciences released a 312-page report this summer primarily blaming \u201cgender harassment\u201d for the lack of gender proportionality in STEM. \u201cGender harassment,\u201d which the NAS defines as \u201cverbal and nonverbal behaviors that convey hostility, objectification, exclusion, or second-class status about members of one gender,\u201d is a relatively new concept, deployed to compensate for researchers\u2019 failure to find much traditional sexual harassment in STEM environments.\n\nThe NAS report recommended additional sex-discrimination bureaucracy in STEM workplaces, new state and federal laws, female-friendly evaluation structures, and \u201cexplicit steps\u201d to increase female hiring. The National Science Foundation pours millions of taxpayer dollars into intersectionality and microaggression studies to smoke out invisible STEM sexism and to promote diversity in research labs. Academic deans and campus diversity bureaucrats pressure faculty hiring committees to regard being a woman as a STEM job qualification.\n\nOther natural experiments suggest that this massive social-engineering project is based on a fiction. Like competitive Scrabble, Wikipedia has no gatekeepers. Anyone can compose or edit an entry; participation is largely anonymous. There are no centuries-old Wiki traditions shoring up male Wiki dominance. Yet only 13% of Wikipedia editors are female, according to the Wikimedia Foundation, even though no one would know the sex of a female editor to be able to discriminate against her. Entries for typically \u201cfemale\u201d subjects are skimpy compared with typically \u201cmale\u201d ones. The implication is unavoidable: Females aren\u2019t as obsessively driven as males to nail down facts, correct errors, and dominate a field.\n\nThe National Geographic Geography Bee shows similar results. Since 1989, boys have won 27 times, girls twice. Nothing prevents or discourages girls from vacuuming up the details of an atlas. But the National Geographic Society has already been sued for discriminating against girls based on that winner ratio alone, as economist Mark Perry has noted. Expect a similar attack on Mattel , sponsor of the World Scrabble Championship, if the Scrabble numbers become widely known.\n\nFeminists have persuaded policy makers that only patriarchal inequity can explain the male dominance of Silicon Valley and of pure research.

Yet while the Yemen war is a human catastrophe, it is often misunderstood as merely a civil war, or an exercise in Saudi adventurism.\n\nIt fact, Yemen is the latest theater of the decades-old conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has been intensifying since Iraq fell into the Iranian orbit in the wake of the 2003 regime change in Baghdad. By the time U.S. troops left Iraq in late 2011, the Arab Spring was well under way. Amid the turmoil, Iran not only consolidated its position in Iraq but projected its power much further in pursuit of its goal: a contiguous sphere of influence from its western border to the Mediterranean.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not been able to do much to block Iran\u2019s expanding footprint across the northern Middle East. But Tehran\u2019s efforts to exploit conflicts on the Arabian Peninsula are a red line for Riyadh. That explains the kingdom\u2019s unprecedented, and successful, move to crush a Shiite uprising in Bahrain in early 2011. Four years later, when the Iranian-backed Houthi movement seized power in Yemen, the Saudis launched a massive war to prevent Iran from establishing an outpost on its southern flank. But unlike in Bahrain, the Saudi intervention in Yemen turned into a quagmire.\n\nThere is a dire need to alleviate the human suffering in Yemen. But a negotiated settlement that leaves the Houthis in a dominant position would turn the country into an Iranian proxy. That would be bad not only for the Saudis but for the broader international community, especially the U.S. Ansarallah\u2014Arabic for \u201cHelpers of God\u201d and the formal name of the Houthi movement\u2014is unabashedly anti-American. A Tehran-dominated Yemen would only breed further conflict in the region.\n\nSaudi Arabia miscalculated when it went to war in Yemen, and the Khashoggi murder is an affront to civilized norms. Even so, it is critical that the West not press so hard on Saudi Arabia that Iran emerges as the beneficiary.\n\nMr. Bokhari is a Washington-based national security and foreign policy specialist with the University of Ottawa\u2019s Professional Development Institute."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Erica Snow", "title": "Fed's Evans Supports Higher Interest Rates", "description": "Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans suggested the central bank needs to raise short-term interest rates further, but didn\u2019t say how much or for how long.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-evans-supports-higher-interest-rates-1542402223", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37615/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:37:30Z", "content": "Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans suggested Friday the central bank needs to raise short-term interest rates further, but didnt say how much or for how long.

Ever since, the pair of Facebook Inc. alums-turned-startup founders have been living a case of life imitating art imitating life.\n\nHBO\u2019s comedy series, which began its run in 2014, tells the story of scrappy startup Pied Piper, which hits on a brilliant algorithm for compressing information so it can zip through the pipes of the internet more quickly.\n\nWaveOne Inc., the startup founded by Messrs. Bourdev and Rippel, is using an artificial intelligence technique to improve upon existing real-life compression technology. And they are finding early success, according to a paper they submitted to an academic conference on Thursday. WaveOne hopes its progress will help it recruit engineers and excite potential customers.\n\nJust like their fictional analog, which faces stiff competition from tech giant \u201cHooli,\u201d the WaveOne team fears its toughest test could be competing against what some argue is Hooli\u2019s real-life corollary: Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.\n\nThe search giant has a team of researchers working on similar video compression technology, a Google spokesman confirmed. Other companies are also working on the technology.\n\nAn HBO spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe six-person team at WaveOne says it isn\u2019t very much like Pied Piper\u2019s band of brilliant weirdos, which includes a self-described Satan-worshipping software engineer; his sparring partner, a Pakistani-born nerd with dry wit; a curly-haired pot smoker totally lacking in self-awareness; a skinny, self-sacrificing organizer who will go to extreme lengths to please the boss; and their naive, anxiety-crippled leader.\n\nA scene from the comedy show \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 about a startup called Pied Piper.

Mr. Anderson, 28, loves Bollywood and hip-hop dancing. Steve Branson, 37 and another research scientist, is an expert rock climber. Mr. Rippel, 30, once taught the Israeli martial art Krav Maga after his postcollege service in the Israel Defense Forces. He declines to discuss details: \u201cA lot of that is classified.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s single conference space in its small, whiteboard-walled offices is called \u201cThe Interrogation Room.\u201d There they interview potential recruits, \u201cpeople who we suspect will infiltrate our org,\u201d jokes Mr. Bourdev, 43.\n\nWhile keeping the company\u2019s work secret from rivals is a priority, he says, Mr. Bourdev\u2019s attempts to do so could probably inspire their own \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d episode.\n\nThey once had a rival researcher over to the office for a social call, they say. Everywhere it said \u201cvideo compression\u201d on an office whiteboard, someone jokingly scribbled the word \u201cNot\u201d in front of it, hoping the engineer wouldn\u2019t notice.\n\nAt a conference Mr. Bourdev attended, he hatched a plan to tell anyone who asked whether his company was working on video compression, \u201cWe could tell you but then we\u2019d have to hire you.\u201d The only person who asked was a senior Google researcher too advanced in his career for the startup to offer a job.\n\nVideo compression is used to encode video files so they take up less storage space and are easier to transmit over the internet, mostly by eliminating redundant information. The hope with artificial intelligence is that it can eliminate more data by making accurate predictions about video frames that are coming next, meaning consumers could get the same picture quality from fewer bits sent through the pipe.\n\nAfter reviewing WaveOne\u2019s paper, Alan Bovik, director of the laboratory for image and video engineering at the University of Texas, said its early results \u201cseem pretty fantastic,\u201d but cautioned the company needs to show its techniques work with more kinds of data.\n\nThe WaveOne team has had fun with its fictional counterpart. Its first academic paper on more basic image compression, published at a 2017 conference, included a nod to the show and its creator: \u201cPied Piper has recently claimed to employ [machine learning] techniques in its Middle-Out algorithm (Judge et al., 2016), although their nature is shrouded in mystery.\u201d\n\nThe reference was spotted by a commenter on the website Hacker News, who accused WaveOne of being a marketing stunt by the show\u2019s creators to drum up interest.\n\nGoogle, meantime, has acknowledged comparisons to the show\u2019s tech giant Hooli. The company hid a link to Hooli\u2019s satirical website in the 2015 blog announcing its reorganization.\n\nSometimes \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d gets even closer to reality.\n\nIlir Sela, owner of online pizza-ordering service SliceLife, was floored in March when the Season Five premiere featured a fictitious pizza company named SliceLine stealing engineers from Pied Piper.\n\nMr. Sela knew to watch the show since his product manager Finn Borge told co-workers to tune in. Mr. Borge swears he had no idea what was coming, that a friend of his girlfriend knew the writers, was aware of the similarities, and got word to him to alert his team. After the episode aired, someone from the show delivered a SliceLine pizza to the SliceLife office.\n\nA person familiar with the SliceLine episode says the name similarity was purely a coincidence.\n\nEmployees at online pizza ordering service SliceLife received pizza from the 'Silicon Valley' show. Photo: Trisha Roiniotis\n\nOne of the show\u2019s creators, Mike Judge, is no stranger to inspiring real-life business plans. His movie \u201cOffice Space\u201d made red Swingline staplers so famous the company had to start making red ones to meet demand. Mr. Judge didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Bourdev says he was once chatting with his old Facebook boss, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, and reminded him that his startup was working on better compression. He says Mr. Zuckerberg cracked that if the WaveOne team could demonstrate a high Weissman score\u2014a fictitious test of compression efficiency developed for the TV show\u2014their technology might interest them. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe pair\u2019s a-ha moment nearly fizzled that day they were first watching the show together.

It was dangerous professionally (and sometimes personally) even to raise the possibility of genetic influence. We were taught, for example, that schizophrenia was caused by what your mother did to you in the first few years of life.\n\nSince then, a mountain of evidence from twin and adoption studies has convinced most scientists that disorders like schizophrenia and traits like cognitive ability run in families for reasons of nature (genetics) not nurture (environment). What is new in the last few years is the DNA revolution. Our ability to read the genetic blueprint of individuals and to predict, from birth, their psychological dispositions is growing by the day. It promises to transform not just how we understand ourselves but how we deal with a range of personal and social problems.\n\nAbout 99% of the 6 billion steps in the spiral staircase of DNA\u2019s double helix are the same for all of us. This is what makes us human. Behavioral geneticists are interested in the 1% of DNA that makes us individuals. A century of research has found that these inherited DNA differences account for about 90% of the differences in people\u2019s physical traits, such as height and eye color. What may come as a surprise is that DNA also accounts, on average, for about 50% of our differences in such psychological traits as personality, mental health and illness, and cognitive ability and disability.\n\nConsider the documentary \u201cThree Identical Strangers,\u201d which was released this summer. It tells the true story of identical American triplets who had been separated at birth in 1961 and intentionally placed with blue-collar, middle-class and upper-class adoptive parents\u2014none of whom were told that their child had identical siblings (therein lies an evil tale of an unethical psychiatrist). The triplets met by chance when they were 19, and the film shows how strikingly similar they were not just in looks but also in personality (outgoing), psychopathology (depressive) and interests (acting), despite the very different environments in which they were nurtured.\n\nDNA is the major systematic influence making us who we are as individuals. Environmental influences are important too, but what look like systematic effects of the environment are often genetic effects in disguise: Parents respond to their children\u2019s genetically driven traits, and children seek, modify and even create experiences correlated with their genetic propensities.\n\nBut knowing that traits are heritable is different from showing which actual differences in DNA are responsible for them. Only in the last decade have we found the necessary tool, a technological advance called SNP chips, which make it possible to map out hundreds of thousands of DNA differences across an individual\u2019s genome quickly and cheaply. (They are called SNP chips because a single-nucleotide polymorphism is the most common type of inherited difference in a double helix of DNA.)\n\nIllustration: Harry Campbell\n\n\u201c Polygenic scoring can predict significant differences across individuals in educational aptitude. \u201d\n\nBy 2017, more than 10,000 significant SNP associations had been reported across many hundreds of traits, as summarized in a 2017 article in The American Journal of Human Genetics by Peter M. Visscher of the University of Queensland. Most of these traits were physical or physiological, though some were psychological.\n\nIn psychology, a remarkable collaboration emerged, called the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, which now includes over 800 researchers from 38 countries. The consortium\u2019s work was summarized in a 2018 paper in The American Journal of Psychiatry by Dr. Patrick Sullivan, who leads the group and splits his time between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.\n\nFocusing on major psychological disorders, the consortium has proved that bigger is better when it comes to studies of heritability. For example, a 2014 paper on schizophrenia included 30,000 cases and netted more than a hundred significant SNP associations. By 2017, the number of cases had doubled, which increased the catch to 155 associations. For bipolar disorder, going from 2000 cases in a 2007 study to 20,000 cases in 2017 increased the number of significant associations from zero to 30. The largest of these individual effects is minuscule, however; each one increases risk infinitesimally.\n\nBut what good are such tiny effects? The answer is that summing the effects of thousands of SNPs can create powerful DNA fortunetellers. These are called polygenic (\u201cmany gene\u201d) scores, and they are the stuff of the coming DNA revolution in psychology.\n\nWith polygenic scores, we can predict psychological traits from inherited differences in DNA without knowing anything about the long and convoluted developmental pathways between genes and behavior, pathways that meander through gene expression, proteins and the brain. Unlike other predictors, this DNA fortuneteller can predict from birth because inherited DNA differences do not change from cradle to grave, from the single cell with which we begin life to the trillions of cells in our adult bodies.\n\nThe biggest revelations so far from polygenic scoring have come in the field of education, which has until recently ignored if not reviled genetics. Almost all of the genetic heritability studies done to date have asked their participants how much education they\u2019ve had. Researchers realized that by pooling all of these samples they could conduct an analysis of educational attainment that reached the daunting sample sizes needed to detect SNP associations.\n\nIn 2013, in a paper in the journal Science, Daniel J. Benjamin of the University of Southern California and his colleagues in the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium used a sample of 125,000 individuals to produce a polygenic score that predicted 2% of the variance of educational attainment. In 2016, they used a sample of 294,000 and predicted 3% of the variance, as reported in the journal Nature Genetics. In 2018, with a sample of 1.1 million, the predictive power of their polygenic score jumped to more than 10% of the variance, as reported in Nature Genetics.\n\nIllustration: Harry Campbell\n\n\u201c A clear genetic risk of alcoholism can act as an alert to anticipate the problem. \u201d\n\nYears of education is a coarse but interesting variable because it captures what it takes to finish university, but the consortium also found that the polygenic score from their largest sample predicts up to 10% of the variance in general cognitive ability (that is, intelligence or IQ). My own research team, led by Andrea Allegrini, showed that this score also predicts 15% of the variance in nationwide tests of school performance in the compulsory subjects of English, mathematics and science given to all U.K. students at the age of 16, a finding that we previewed in the journal BioRxiv earlier this year.\n\nThis prediction of school performance is the most powerful polygenic score reported to date in the behavioral sciences. Predicting 15% of the differences in school performance might not seem like much, but it is a better predictor than the educational attainment of the students\u2019 parents. My team showed that children with the 10% highest polygenic scores are five times more likely to go to university than children with the 10% lowest scores.\n\nIn the behavioral sciences, we can rarely explain more than 5% of the variance of traits. Ratings of school quality, for example, explain less than 2% of the differences in children\u2019s school performance. Although polygenic scores only burst on to the stage in the last few years, they are already the best predictors we have for certain traits.\n\nNo specific policy implications necessarily follow from finding that inherited DNA differences are by far the most important source of individual differences in school achievement and that schools make so little difference. Regardless of the predispositions of their students, schools should be supportive places for children to spend more than a decade of their lives, places where they can learn basic skills but also learn to enjoy learning.\n\nPolygenic scores make these genetic findings more real and personal because they can predict problems and promise for individuals. Polygenic scores for educational attainment not only predict performance in school but also success later in life, such as mate choice, occupational status, social mobility and even financial planning for retirement, as shown by Daniel W. Belsky and colleagues at Duke University in a paper called \u201cThe Genetics of Success\u201d that was published in the journal Psychological Science in 2016. The reason for the wider effects of the polygenic score for educational attainment is that it taps into other traits needed to succeed in higher education, not just intelligence but also qualities such as conscientiousness, grit and mental health.\n\nWhat if you found out that one of your children has a low polygenic score for educational attainment? It\u2019s just a probabilistic prediction\u2014genes are not destiny and heritability describes what is, not what could be\u2014but it might still be hard to accept. It is important that parents are not fatalistic about their children. On the other hand, polygenic scores might help parents understand that a child\u2019s lack of interest in higher education is not necessarily a sign of recalcitrance or laziness. Learning is more difficult and less enjoyable for some children than for others.\n\nIllustration: Harry Campbell\n\n\u201c Knowing of a gene-based tendency to gain weight can spur preventive strategies. \u201d\n\nThis is just the beginning of the era of polygenic scores. They are currently available for hundreds of physical and physiological traits and for dozens of psychological traits, including personality (extroversion and neuroticism, for example), adult mental illness (schizophrenia and depression) and childhood behavior problems (hyperactivity and anxiety). Research has been done for hundreds of other traits that will soon lead to polygenic scores for them, and bigger and better studies will continually produce more powerful polygenic scores. It is a safe bet that the predictive power of most of these scores will at least double in the next few years.\n\nPolygenic scoring makes it possible to identify problems on the basis of underlying genetic causes rather than behavioral symptoms. Its moves psychology away from binary diagnoses\u2014yes or no for schizophrenia?\u2014and toward assessments along a spectrum, because scores are continuous from low risk to high risk.\n\nThere is no point at which genetic risk tips over into pathology. We all have thousands of DNA differences that predispose us to schizophrenia; genetic risk depends on how many of these differences we have. It\u2019s all quantitative, a matter of more or less. Genetically speaking, there are no disorders, just dimensions.\n\nAnother transformative impact of polygenic scoring on psychology is to shift the focus from treatment to prevention. Polygenic scores are the perfect early-warning system. The predictive power of polygenic scoring promotes interventions to prevent problems, in stark contrast to what we do now, which is to wait until problems emerge and then try to fix them.\n\nWould you not want to know that you or your child is at genetic risk for alcohol problems? Knowing that you are at risk might make you more likely to heed the message for all of us to be mindful of our alcohol consumption, because you can\u2019t become alcoholic unless you drink a lot of alcohol. Forewarned is forearmed.\n\nA further benefit of polygenic scoring is self-understanding. Last year, my research team produced the world\u2019s first comprehensive polygenic score profile for an individual: It was for me. I discovered, for example, that my polygenic risk for weight\u2014that is, body mass index (BMI)\u2014is at the 94th percentile. Seeing me, you wouldn\u2019t need my DNA to know that I am on the portly side, but my DNA would have predicted this at birth, which offers the possibility of early intervention, long before weight in childhood becomes predictive of adult BMI.\n\nThe author, seen here on the grounds of the Glyndebourne Opera House, learned that his own polygenic score showed him at risk for obesity at the 94th percentile for body mass index. Currently at only the 70th percentile, he was motivated to fight going any higher Credit: Courtesy Robert Plomin Photo: Courtesy Robert Plomin\n\nPeople might worry that having a DNA fortuneteller will lead them to give up on improving themselves. But did learning of my high polygenic risk for obesity mean that I must resign myself to being overweight? To the contrary, I find it motivating to know that I am in for a lifelong battle of the bulge.\n\nOne general message that we should take from genetics is tolerance for others and for ourselves. Rather than blaming people for being overweight, we should recognize and respect the huge impact of genetics on individual differences. Genetics, not lack of willpower, is the major reason why people differ in BMI and in various other traits. Success and failure, credit and blame, in overcoming problems should be calibrated relative to genetic strengths and weaknesses.\n\nPolygenic scoring represents a major scientific advance and, like all scientific advances, it can be used for ill as well as good. The use of these scores to predict individuals\u2019 genetic propensities requires clear warnings about the probabilistic nature of the predictions: Our genes don\u2019t determine our fates.\n\nBut it would be paternalistic to prevent people from learning, if they so choose, how their genome shapes their lives and prospects. The DNA genie is out of the bottle and, even if we tried, we cannot stuff it back in.\n\n\u2014\n\nThis essay is adapted from Dr. Plomin\u2019s new book, \u201cBlueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are,\u201d published by The MIT Press.

Photo: jonathan ernst/Reuters\n\nLast week Democrats took the U.S. House and thereby captured the subpoena power they\u2019ve been craving to torment President Donald Trump for at least the next two years. But voters declined to deliver a full-throated repudiation of Mr. Trump and appear to have expanded the Republican majority in the Senate. Voters have also shown Mr. Trump the path to a 2020 re-election. And he\u2019s about to gain a nearly perfect adversary.\n\nAmid the celebrations surrounding dozens of new House seats, Democrats have also been expressing their ongoing concern that the people who have been instructed by the media to hate Mr. Trump and his party aren't falling into leftist line.\n\n\u201cOne Lesson From The Midterms: The \u2018Latino Vote\u2019 Is Up For Grabs,\u201d says the headline on a commentary published by Boston public broadcaster WBUR. The author is Josiane Martinez, a political consultant who this year helped progressive leftist Ayanna Pressley win a House seat which used to belong to a more centrist Democrat.\n\nMs. Martinez discusses Florida, \u201cwhere 44 percent of Latinos voted for Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis, who famously appeared in a campaign ad helping his young child build President Trump\u2019s border wall out of play bricks.\u201d She adds:\n\nIn Massachusetts, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker won re-election in a 34-point landslide, winning diverse voters who usually turn out for Democrats in our blue state. Baker tied Democratic opponent Jay Gonzalez with 48 percent of the Latino vote, according to exit polls.\n\nNearby at the Boston Globe, Renee Graham recently drafted a \u201cMemo to black men: Stop voting Republican.\u201d Ms. Graham writes:\n\nBrothers, we need to talk.\n\nIn the midterm elections, about 17 percent of black men voted to give Texas Republican Ted Cruz another term in the Senate. Around 11 percent supported Georgia gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp...\n\nThese aren\u2019t huge percentages, but enough to disrupt Democratic strategies that have been premised for years on overwhelming support among African-Americans. Ms. Graham is particularly concerned that younger black men are more open to voting Republican than their elders.\n\nThe point is that Mr. Trump has room to grow his support among minority voters. And regardless of color, there are plenty of voters who already like his program but aren\u2019t sold on him. This column noted last month that Mr. Trump appears to be setting a modern record in the share of the electorate saying that they don\u2019t like the President personally, but approve of most of his policies. This category of voters currently stands at 20% of the electorate, according to a recent WSJ/NBC survey. For most recent Presidents such readings were generally in the low-to-mid single digits, though Bill Clinton\u2019s share did climb into the teens.\n\nWhether or not voters like Mr. Trump personally, the big policy area where Democrats enjoyed a huge edge last week was health care.\n\nTo summarize, Mr. Trump is not doomed to a shrinking demographic and his policies are generally popular, but he has what might be called a likability gap and his party needs to give voters better answers on health care. Fortunately for the President, he now has an outstanding opportunity to address his key weaknesses.\n\nCongressional investigations will no doubt be taxing, but Mr. Trump will now have a political foil virtually guaranteed to present policies that are anathema to large swaths of the electorate. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is a San Francisco liberal who helps elect Republicans all over Middle America. Her emerging rival for the Speaker\u2019s gavel, Rep. Marcia Fudge (D., Ohio) stands even further to the left. The 2018 Almanac of American Politics rates the Fudge record on social issues in the last Congress as 100% liberal. On economics she scored 98% liberal and just 2% conservative.\n\nJoshua Jamerson and Natalie Andrews note in the Journal that Ms. Fudge is \u201ca member of the progressive caucus, which represents the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing.\u201d More moderate rivals may emerge. But given that most Democrats in the current Congress have already endorsed socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 government-run health care plan that ends private insurance, what are the odds that a centrist can collect 218 votes and claim the gavel?\n\nA Democratic majority means that the party cannot simply accuse Republicans of wanting to take away benefits. Democrats must now put their plans on the floor and vote on them. This creates new opportunities for Republicans to point out the flaws in Democratic plans to enlarge the bureaucracies already stifling American medicine.\n\nFor example, ObamaCare requires that insurance plans include various benefits that consumers may not want, driving up costs. And consumers would welcome the chance to customize their coverage. Pollster Scott Rasmussen writes today:\n\nSeventy-eight percent (78%) of voters favor letting each worker choose how much health insurance they are willing to pay for. They could have less expensive insurance and more take home pay or more expensive insurance and less take-home pay. A ScottRasmussen.com national survey found that just 21% oppose giving workers that choice.\n\nIf they had the choice, two-thirds of workers (65%) would opt for less-expensive insurance and more take home pay. Black and Hispanic voters who receive insurance from their employer are even more likely to prefer a higher paycheck. So are workers earning less than $75,000 a year.\n\nPresident Trump can now present himself as the architect of successful economic policies protecting consumers against a Democratic House bent on raising their costs and limiting their choices. Voters may decide that\u2019s a very good reason to like him.\n\n***\n\nBottom Stories of the Day will return on Monday.\n\n***\n\nFollow James Freeman on Twitter.\n\nSubscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.\n\nTo suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.\n\n(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.)\n\n***\n\nMr. Freeman is the co-author of \u201cBorrowed Time,\u201d now available from HarperBusiness."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Vivian Salama", "title": "Trump Awards Medal of Freedom to Republican Donor, Presley, Sports Legends - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Trump Awards Medal of Freedom to Republican Donor, Presley, Sports Legends Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, to a prominent Republican donor, a \u2026", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-awards-medal-of-freedom-to-republican-donor-presley-sports-legends-1542406574", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37639/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:20:54Z", "content": "WASHINGTONPresident Trump presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nations highest civilian award, to a prominent Republican donor, a veteran lawmaker, and music and sports icons at a White House ceremony Friday.

From a $90.3 million David Hockney painting that set a record for a living artist to an estimated $40 million Vincent van Gogh that failed to sell at all, collectors gave wildly differing signals about where they think art values should go.\n\nSotheby\u2019s , Christie\u2019s and Phillips sold roughly $1.9 billion worth of art combined during the weeklong series, on par with expectations, but a roller-coaster atmosphere defined the latest round that may make it harder for the houses to parse the market\u2019s trajectory moving forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all highs and lows,\u201d said Chicago collector Stefan Edlis midway through the week.\n\nTrophies Are Still in Trouble\u2026\n\nDuring the recession a decade ago, collectors coped by shying away from lower-priced goods and splurged instead on the priciest\u2014and seemingly safest\u2014masterpieces in the auction catalogs. The strategy pushed up prices for Pablo Picasso and Alberto Giacometti while second-tier artists languished. Now, collectors are reversing tack by competing aggressively for works below $20 million yet squinting hard at trophy art, with some exceptions. Dealers said newly wealthy collectors are no longer announcing their art-world arrival by buying up the top lots at auctions; increasingly, newcomers show up with art advisers who can steer them from overspending or urge them to give second-tier artists a chance.\n\nRen\u00e9 Magritte, \u2018The Principle of Pleasure.\u2019 Photo: Sotheby's\n\nTo stoke bids for its Hockney, 1972\u2019s \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures),\u201d which carried an $80 million estimate, Christie\u2019s took the unusual move of opening the bidding for the work at $18 million\u2014a starting price that would have been shockingly low a few years ago when bids for similarly priced works tended to kick off at $60 million. But the gambit paid off as four bidders took the lower bait and chased the work up to its intended estimate and beyond. The telephone bidder for the Hockney remains anonymous.\n\nSotheby\u2019s set a record for Ren\u00e9 Magritte when it initially opened bids for \u201cThe Principle of Pleasure,\u201d a surrealist view of a man in a suit with a glowing orb for a head, for $11 million, allowing bidders to push it up to $26.8 million, over its $20 million high estimate.\n\nOther works with hefty price-tags landed like a thud, though. Dealers said the estimated $40 million van Gogh, \u201cGarden Corner with Butterflies,\u201d that stalled at Christie\u2019s on Sunday may have suffered because the painting showed a row of shrubs rather than his signature imagery like a colorful sky or wavy field. But no one wanted Claude Monet\u2019s unmistakable 1881 view of a flowery garden, \u201cThe Staircase at V\u00e9theuil,\u201d from the same sale, which Christie\u2019s had estimated would sell for at least $12 million. It stalled at $7.5 million and went unsold.\n\nVincent van Gogh, \u2018Garden Corner with Butterflies.\u2019 Photo: CHRISTIE\u2019S IMAGES LTD.\n\nPicasso\u2019s rainbow-colored portrait of his blonde mistress, 1937\u2019s \u201cWoman in an Orange Beret and Fur Collar (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se),\u201d was the peak of fashion a few years ago, but it also stalled below its $15 million estimate and went unsold.\n\nSotheby\u2019s guaranteed the seller of Marsden Hartley\u2019s \u201cPre-War Pageant\u201d that the abstract would sell for at least $30 million\u2014but didn\u2019t sell at all\u2014and other works by Wassily Kandinsky, Gerhard Richter and Yves Klein sold following a single bid, a sign of thin interest.\n\n\u2026But There\u2019s Froth in the Middle Market\n\nBeneath the trophies sit the middle-market, where works can hover from $10,000 to $10 million, and this segment continues to heat up so quickly that there are signs of froth, as buyers compete for less-expensive examples by artists whose values seem poised to climb. All three houses said their daylong sales of lower-priced goods enjoyed major turnouts, with Christie\u2019s selling 100% of its $11.5 million Giacometti design sale on Monday and Phillips\u2019 $25.5 million contemporary-art day sale logged as the highest in company history.\n\nArtists who benefited from the extra attention include Philip Guston, whose 1969-70 drawing, \u201cWindow,\u201d sold at Christie\u2019s for $3.1 million, six times its high estimate, and Dana Schutz, whose 2003 figure holding a guitar, \u201cHer Arms,\u201d drew nine bidders and sold for a record $795,000. Kaws also survived his market test with works selling above the auction houses\u2019 high estimates at both Christie\u2019s and Phillips, including a $2.7 million painting, \u201cUntitled (Fatal Group),\u201d that was only expected to sell for up to $900,000.\n\nPhilip Guston, \u2018Window.\u2019 Photo: CHRISTIE\u2019S IMAGES LTD.\n\nBargains Abounded for the Sharp-Eyed\n\nAmerican collectors dominated the fall auctions once again, and their tastes largely determined which artists soared\u2014like Edward Hopper\u2019s $91.9 million \u201cChop Suey\u201d at Christie\u2019s\u2014but others said they mined the thick catalogs and found some deals. Dealer Marc Glimcher said he was \u201cshocked\u201d that a collector won Joseph Stella\u2019s 1919 \u201cTree of My Life\u201d at Christie\u2019s on Tuesday for $5.9 million, under its $6 million low estimate.\n\nJackson Pollock also looked like a potential steal when his 1950 \u201cComposition with Red Strokes\u201d sold for $55.4 million, just over its $50 million low estimate at Christie\u2019s, but another drippy example at Phillips, \u201cNumber 16,\u201d stalled at $15.7 million and went unsold. Its proceeds were earmarked to help Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Museum of Modern Art.\n\nJoseph Stella, \u2018Tree of My Life.\u2019 Photo: CHRISTIE\u2019S IMAGES LTD.\n\nAsian Bidders Showed Up\n\nIt helped that Asian collectors from Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia showed up to bid across the sales, despite the fact that dealers and advisers had said they might stay home amid roiling macroeconomic fears. Their presence was best felt in the impressionist and modern art sales, where Christie\u2019s said Asians bid or bought at least a dozen works in its evening sale on Sunday\u2014including its top lot, a $32 million Monet \u201cWater-lily Pond;\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said roughly 16 works in its impressionist and modern sale were bid or won by Asian collectors.\n\nSotheby\u2019s expert Patti Wong said Asian collectors are branching out beyond Picasso and Monet. During the latest round, Asians took home pieces by Chaim Soutine, Camille Pissarro, Elizabeth Peyton, Donald Judd, Rudolf Stingel and Kaws.\n\nClaude Monet\u2019s \u2018Water-lily Pond.\u2019 Photo: CHRISTIE\u2019S IMAGES LTD.\n\n\u2026So Did Bidders for African-American Artists\n\nCollectors also continue to recalibrate prices for African-American artists like Jacob Lawrence, whose 1947 painting, \u201cThe Businessmen,\u201d sparked a nine-minute bidding war at Sotheby\u2019s and sold for $6.2 million, tripling its high estimate and setting a new auction high bar for the artist. Christie\u2019s said at least eight bidders vied for Robert Colescott\u2019s 1987 \u201cCultural Exchange,\u201d with the winner paying $912,500, more than doubling its high estimate and a record auction price for the artist.\n\nWrite to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Wall Street Journal", "title": "Will California Fires Promote Better Policy? - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Will California Fires Promote Better Policy?

Even Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) has a television ad showing millions of dead trees that need to be cleared and turned into lumber before they are unusable. California used to have a thriving lumber industry until politics killed it. Our representatives are aware of the problems but do very little about them. Instead they want a carbon tax to give them even more money to waste. I wonder how much carbon and other chemicals are being released by these terrible fires. Politicians fiddle, while California burns.\n\nPoliticians fiddle, while California burns. Of course the problem isn\u2019t just about trees but brush as well. To get brush cleared can be difficult due to the expense as well as obtaining the required permits and getting past people who object because they want a \u201cnatural\u201d environment.\n\nGary Oetting\n\nKing City, Calif.\n\nThe larger lesson is the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of government regulatory interference in the environment and so many other aspects of our lives that have become a systemic hazard. The conceit of the progressive agenda is that knowledgeable, objective regulators can manage most aspects of our lives better than we can individually. There are few, if any, examples of government regulation or management being effective and efficient. Those who support regulatory structures rarely look at the overall impact, and none of those who impose or implement the regulatory agendas are held accountable for the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe politicians who brought us the housing disaster were able to blame the banks. Gov. Jerry Brown has recently blamed climate deniers for the California fires and the state regulatory apparatus is hard on the heels of PG&E executives because they are not able to deliver 100% safe electrical power to remote areas of the state.\n\nCullen Coates\n\nLincoln, Calif.\n\nAfter more than 150 years of raping our timberlands, draining our water supply and mining our natural resources to death on federal land, it\u2019s comical that blame is being placed on conservation as the culprit.\n\nCalifornia is in the sixth year of a drought. Beetles, fires and drought have killed millions of trees; over a million dead trees have been removed. The recent fires started in dry grass and scrub which was on urban private property and raced through very well-managed parklands. It\u2019s an annual occurrence, but the high winds, dry air and location of the fire outbreak allowed a 30-mile path of destruction to burn in less than two hours.\n\nClimate change has made each fire season more treacherous, and there is no reasonable method of prevention short of plowing the forest into the dirt. Fires are part of the natural ecosystem in California, but more destructive fires are the new normal.\n\nJohn Tobin\n\nWoodland Hills, Calif.\n\nConsidering that every video shot of the burning homes includes trees and bushes, it seems another problem is poor landscaping management on the part of California homeowners.\n\nDavid W.R. Brown\n\nSun City, Fla.\n\nIf other states sued California over air quality, maybe it would be inclined to manage its forests and brushland better. The residents in Boulder, Colo., would love to be plaintiffs for this cause. I\u2019m sure they get California\u2019s smoke. What is the EPA doing about holding California responsible for this massive carbon and particulate assault on the environment?\n\nSteve Juhan\n\nTucson, Ariz."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jeffrey A.

Now a New Yorker, Mr. van Wyck said his entertaining skills took root when he was a child living \u201ctwo hours away from anything,\u201d spending Christmas Eve dinner at his grandmother\u2019s home which was handsomely trimmed with magnolia-leaf garlands. \u201cHer table featured Red Aves china from Royal Crown Derby,\u201d he said, as well as bird feathers and abandoned nests, which they filled with pomegranates. \u201cShe mixed it all up, and made it beautiful.\u201d Recently, we chatted with him about traditions old and new.\n\nThe most common mistake I see in table settings is: overmatching. I went to a dinner recently with beautiful china from Bernardaud. The flatware was Herm\u00e8s. Everything was perfect, everything was the best. But it looked like a showroom setting.\n\nI always put a few things on the table that: have a back story. I\u2019m from a state that produces a lot of rock crystal, so I\u2019ve got that from home. I always have obelisks from somewhere. If somebody asks, everything has a story.\n\nI learned about using candles on the table from: my grandmother, who had all kinds of candlesticks, all old silver. She had a river of them at different heights running down the table, which is flattering for people, because the light hits them at different heights.\n\nOne of my favorite holiday decorations is: magnolia garland. You put it up for Thanksgiving and it dries and looks great through Christmas.\n\nFrom left: Royal Crown Derby Dinner Plate Red Aves, $115, replacements.com; Russian Malachite Obelisks and Gilt Bronze, $18,728, 1stdibs.com; Original Magnolias Garland, $64 for six feet, themagnoliacompany.com.

Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal\n\nMy latest go-to greens d\u00e9cor strategy is: mixing juniper and jasmine, because I love the scent of jasmine. Juniper is easy to find at holidays, but you need a florist or someone to find you the jasmine.\n\nTrees look best in lights that: are one color, two colors or three colors, typically in the same family, like dark blue, pale blue and turquoise.\n\nMy team uses glass paint to make: Christmas lights in unusual colors\u2014warm cinnamon red, wintry loden green, goldenrod. Like dying Easter eggs, it\u2019s fun to do together. Remove the bulbs from the strand, and use a Q-Tip to hand color them.\n\nTo survive the holidays, I rely on: several handles of tequila\u2014Herradura silver to mix and Clase Azul Reposado to sip.\n\nMy current hostess gift is: fantastic umbrellas with wooden handles from Plain Goods\u2014particularly great if you\u2019re going somewhere rainy.\n\nFrom left: Handmade umbrella, $220, plain-goods.com; Pomegranate; Clase Azul Reposado Tequila, $100.

It\u2019s mutual.\n\nA successful kid\u2019s table involves: an activity, like the children decorating gingerbread cookies before and while they are eating. And they don\u2019t get to eat the gingerbread cookies until the end of the meal, so it\u2019s an incentive to eat dinner too.\n\nMy general rule for buffets and holiday meals is: everything should be prepared in advance and served at room temperature or require only heating up.\n\nFoods that taste good at room temperature include: roasted or smoked meat, a turkey, ham or tenderloin. Seasonal salads, Brussels sprouts, cranberry sauce.\n\nMy \u2018prepare in advance and heat up\u2019 foods include: mashed potatoes, gravy, biscuits, mushrooms and grains.\n\nI do accessorize: my dog, Cat (for Catherine of Cambridge) for the holidays.

PCG -1.89% rallied Friday on hopes that California officials would move to rescue the utility from potential wildfire liability costs that threaten to drive it into bankruptcy.\n\nBut state legislators gave little indication of whether they would propose a way to let PG&E pass costs from liability lawsuits stemming from this year\u2019s fires to customers, a likely necessity to ensure the company\u2019s solvency.\n\nThe stock\u2019s rebound came after California\u2019s top energy regulator late Thursday indicated an openness to letting the utility bill customers for some of those costs, a signal that boosted PG&E by nearly 38% on Friday, to close at $24.40.\n\nThe share price had fallen for six consecutive days on concerns that PG&E, already facing billions of dollars in potential liability costs from 2017 wildfires, could face even higher costs related to this year\u2019s Camp Fire in Northern California, which has killed more than 60 people, making it the deadliest wildfire in state history.\n\nMichael Picker, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in an interview Thursday that he preferred that PG&E not enter into bankruptcy because it could raise its cost of borrowing, which could end up raising energy costs for its customers. \u201cIt is generally not good policy for utilities to go into bankruptcy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe utility, which is based in San Francisco, disclosed late last week that a problem occurred on one of its high-voltage power lines in Northern California 15 minutes before the start of the Camp Fire was reported in the area on Nov. 8. No definitive connection between the line outage and the fire has been made, and California fire investigators will likely take months to make a final determination.\n\nPG&E, which has stressed that the cause of the fire hasn\u2019t been determined, welcomed the state\u2019s efforts to help it stabilize. Spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo said, \u201cWe agree with CPUC President Picker\u2019s statement that an essential component of providing safe electrical service is long-term financial stability. Access to affordable capital is critical to carrying out safety measures and meeting California\u2019s bold clean-energy goals.\u201d\n\nThe state earlier this year passed legislation allowing utilities to seek approval from the Public Utilities Commission to securitize a portion of wildfire-related liability by issuing bonds that would be paid off by their customers.\n\nBut as written, the measure applies only to liabilities arising from wildfires that occurred in 2017. It also offers utilities expanded protections for liabilities for events in 2019 and beyond, under certain circumstances. But that leaves a gap for fires this year.\n\nSearch Teams Sift Through Torched Neighborhoods in Northern California In Paradise, Calif., investigators combed through neighborhoods reduced to ash, searching for human remains after the Camp Fire wildfire swept through the town.

In a private conference call hosted by Bank of America on Thursday, he indicated such an extension could occur without help from the state legislature\u2014which helped kick-start the rebound in PG&E shares.\n\nHowever, analysts said an extension would almost certainly require California lawmakers to revise their earlier legislation.\n\n\u201cThe utilities are looking to the legislature to resolve the 2018 hole, not the CPUC,\u201d said Timothy Fox, vice president at ClearView Energy Partners. \u201cYou can\u2019t interpret a date differently.\u201d\n\nThus far, California\u2019s top lawmakers have remained mostly silent on what steps the legislature might take to mitigate the liability costs PG&E could face in the wake of the Camp Fire.\n\nFire liability has become a major problem for utilities in the state due to a provision of the California constitution known as \u201cinverse condemnation.\u201d Among other things, the rule puts utilities on the hook to pay damages resulting from fires sparked by their equipment, even if they aren\u2019t found negligent.\n\nMr. Picker on Thursday also pledged a review of PG&E\u2019s corporate governance and operations, expanding an existing probe into its safety practices. He said his agency would consider breaking up the utility if warranted.\n\nCalifornia state Sen. Jerry Hill, the only Democrat in the legislature\u2019s upper house who voted against the measure to help utilities earlier this year, said he believed the breakup question should be explored in light of the potential for new liabilities arising from the Camp Fire.\n\n\u201cThe legislature thought PG&E was too big to fail, but I think they\u2019re too big to succeed,\u201d Mr. Hill said Friday. \u201cTheir motive for business is profits for shareholders, not safety for ratepayers.\u201d\n\nMr. Hill added, however, that he thinks the legislature will likely move to enact a new bill extending the 2017 protection measures to include damages incurred this year.\n\nDespite Friday\u2019s rally, shares in PG&E are trading well below levels prior to the outbreak of the Camp Fire. The stock is off more than 45% this year, putting it on track for its worst year on record.\n\n\u2014Jim Carlton and Kimberly Chin contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Russell Gold at russell.gold@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Allison Duncan", "title": "How the Design Biz Is Courting Millennials", "description": "Four ways the design and housewares businesses are catering to a generation that wants to mix and match and will buy (nearly) anything online.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-design-biz-is-courting-millennials-1542382075", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CJ674_MILLEN_SOC_20181114130400.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:56:57Z", "content": "ITS A TRUISM THAT millennials are more comfortable with technology and shopping from home than older generations, and direct-to-consumer design brands are capitalizing on this ease via e-commerce.

But his first impulse is not to fight crime and avenge injustice\u2014it\u2019s to cash in. The future superhero wants to go into show business and earn some money, so that his doting Aunt May and Uncle Ben won\u2019t have to struggle just to get by.\n\nMr. Lee, who died this week at the age of 95, was an editor, writer and art director who helped to create the beloved (and lucrative) characters of the Marvel Comics Universe, including Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the X-Men. But while Lee was a master of fantasy, he and his colleagues\u2014especially Ditko and artist Jack Kirby\u2014were also children of the Great Depression who knew what it meant to fight for economic survival. Their superheroes dealt with financial anxieties that made Marvel\u2019s stories more relatable than those of their competitors. DC Comics\u2019 Superman never seemed to worry about paying the rent on his Fortress of Solitude. Marvel\u2019s Fantastic Four, on the other hand, once went bankrupt and were evicted from their skyscraper headquarters.\n\nLee was keenly aware of the economic realities of his industry. He knew that the comics Marvel published had to be good, but they also needed to be promoted. In the 1960s, Marvel was a small company with only two full-time employees and no publicity department, so Lee set about doing the publicity himself\u2014and, in the process, transformed the business of comics. With Marvel now a pillar of Hollywood\u2014in 2018 alone, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d grossed $1.3 billion in world-wide ticket sales, while \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d took in more than $2 billion\u2014Lee\u2019s strategies have become integral to how the entertainment industry operates.\n\nLee\u2019s most important move was to \u201cage up\u201d the audience for comic books, without losing the young readers who were the industry\u2019s bread and butter. In the 1950s, the arrival of television and a moral panic about the supposed bad influence of comics had dealt the business a serious blow, and comic books had come to be seen as almost exclusively a children\u2019s medium. According to a story that Lee often told, he realized that older people were also reading comics when he heard from some Columbia University students that the Hulk was their dorm mascot. He seized the market opportunity, becoming the first comic book creator to do personal appearances at colleges all over the country. Marvel was no longer just trying to appeal to children for a few years; it aimed to create lifelong fans.\n\n\u201c In the 1960s, buying Marvel Comics merchandise became a sign that you were with it, in the know. \u201d\n\nLee took Marvel\u2019s college-age readers and shaped them into a community whose core identity had to do with buying Marvel comics. He worked with many writers and artists who earned their living in advertising (or hoped to)\u2014Marvel\u2019s offices, from the late 1950s through the early 1980s, were on Madison Avenue\u2014and he adopted the latest branding strategies, turning Marvel merchandise like T-shirts and posters into must-have items. In the 1960s, buying Marvel Comics merchandise became a sign that you were with it, in the know, just like listening to an album by Mike Nichols and Elaine May or reading a novel by Kurt Vonnegut.\n\nTo really be part of the Marvel community, of course, you had to buy comic books\u2014a lot of them. To ensure that readers would keep coming back for more, Lee mastered the concept of \u201ccontinuity\u201d\u2014the idea that different comic book titles were interconnected, all taking place within a single \u201cMarvel Universe.\u201d He was able to do this because, in the early 1960s, he was editing and scripting the stories of practically every Marvel character, including the Fantastic Four, Thor and Spider-Man.\n\nThis was, in part, a creative decision, allowing characters and story lines to cross over from one comic book to another. But it was a business decision as well: Those interconnections\u2014signaled by asterisked footnotes within the comics\u2014alerted fans that they would be missing out if they didn\u2019t buy all of Marvel\u2019s titles. Today, the same model applies to Marvel movies, where an \u201cEaster egg\u201d scene in the credits might be used to tease an upcoming film or new character.\n\nLee was also a pioneer in turning Marvel\u2019s writers and artists into personalities in their own right. By bestowing nicknames on those who made the comics and relating anecdotes about them, he created the image of a band of merry pranksters and outsiders. Formerly anonymous creators, whose signatures were tucked in the corner of a page, many became beloved, idiosyncratic figures with their own followings. Lee thus set the stage for the rise of individual creative entrepreneurs in comics, which would lead to huge changes in profit-sharing and intellectual property rights. In the early 1980s, for instance, a penciler named Frank Miller who began working for Marvel was quickly lionized by the fans. Before long, he was writing and drawing independent, creator-owned material such as \u201cSin City,\u201d which has been adapted for a film and a sequel, both co-directed by Mr. Miller.\n\nWhat was perhaps Lee\u2019s most notable business decision came in 1980, when he relocated to California before any other major comics executive. The move allowed him to focus on adapting the intellectual property that he and the company had developed for other media. Though Marvel\u2019s comics offices are still in New York (DC\u2019s moved to L.A. several years ago), today it also has a large presence in Hollywood, and the company makes many of its creative decisions with an eye to next year\u2019s summer blockbuster.\n\nStan Lee lived to see Marvel dominate a TV and film business where it had enjoyed only limited success in the past. He reveled in the knowledge that his innovations and insights had made the company not only a purveyor of iconic myths but a media titan.\n\n\u2014Mr. Dauber, a professor at Columbia University, is at work on a history of American comics. Mr. Fingeroth was a longtime writer and editor at Marvel Comics and is the author of a biography of Stan Lee that will be published next year."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Daniel Akst", "title": "What Doctors Don't Tell You About Cataract Surgery - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal What Doctors Don't Tell You About Cataract Surgery Wall Street Journal Leigh Palmer, an artist in Hudson, N.Y., is thrilled that he had cataract surgery to replace the cloudy lenses in his eyes.

Bell\u2019s holdout poked at a question much greater than one player\u2019s value: How much is a running back worth in the modern NFL?\n\nThe smartest NFL teams have realized in recent years that committing major resources to a running back may not be the savviest move. The New York Giants spent the second pick of the draft on Saquon Barkley, and it has done nothing to lift the team\u2019s malaise. The Arizona Cardinals signed David Johnson to a long-term deal and still have the worst offense in the league.\n\nThen Bell held out for a long-term deal that he didn\u2019t get and now he\u2019ll sit out for the entire 2018 season.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe problem for running backs is that they aren\u2019t the game changers they once were. Teams are passing more, which means they\u2019re running less. Even the best running backs are often on the wrong side of the age curve by the time they hit free agency. And more and more, there\u2019s reason to believe it\u2019s one of the most replaceable positions in the sport.\n\nThe drama around Bell, arguably the best running back in the NFL, explains this best. From 2014 through last season, no player in the league had more combined rushing and receiving yards than Bell. And the only two running backs even within 1,000 yards of his 6,737 both played at least 10 more games than he did. But with the two parties unable to agree on a long-term deal, and Pittsburgh holding control over him through the franchise tag\u2014a lucrative, but one-year deal teams can use to hold on to players\u2014Bell held out.\n\nThat holdout lasted through training camp, the preseason and into the regular season. When he didn\u2019t show up this week, a league-mandated deadline, it sealed his fate: Bell would sit all year, making him the first holdout on a franchise tag to sit an entire season in more than two decades. When the deadline passed, video surfaced of Pittsburgh players rummaging through his former locker to collect gear.\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason the Steelers weren\u2019t wallowing in the disappointment that a star teammate, one who made the Pro Bowl in three of the previous four seasons, wasn\u2019t returning for their playoff run. That\u2019s because Pittsburgh became ground zero for realizing a running back\u2019s fungibility. Bell\u2019s replacement has performed just like Bell.\n\nJames Conner, who was slated to be Bell\u2019s backup, is near the top of the leaderboards now that he\u2019s the Steelers lead back. Conner is third in the league in rushing touchdowns, third in rushing yards and second in total yards from scrimmage.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers running back James Conner has filled the void left by Le\u2019Veon Bell. Photo: Brian Kunst/Zuma Press\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t clear how much Bell loses in the outcome\u2014he gives up the nearly $15 million he would have earned this season but could still net a megadeal in free agency\u2014the Steelers won their end of it. They resisted committing a lot of money to a running back. And they\u2019re 6-2-1 on the season, averaging the fourth most points per game in the NFL. They aren\u2019t hurting.\n\nBut some teams that are hurting made a different calculation. Last spring, the Giants had the No. 2 pick in a quarterback-rich draft and had an aging quarterback that most people believed needed replacing. Instead of drafting Eli Manning\u2019s heir, though, they decided to support him with the consensus top running back prospect. Barkley became the highest running back selected since 2006.\n\nBarkley is the paradox who explains the state of running backs in the NFL at a time when teams pass more than ever. His selection has been a success and a failure.\n\nBarkley is unquestionably one of the best running backs in the NFL, and a modern one at that. He is on pace for more than 1,000 rushing yards and could become just the third running back ever, and the first since Marshall Faulk in 1999, with more than 1,000 rushing and receiving yards in the same season.\n\nThe problem for the Giants is that it\u2019s unclear how much better he has made them. They are 2-7 and headed for a second consecutive season toward the bottom of the standings. They still don\u2019t have a long-term answer at quarterback. And the cost of drafting Barkley was that they didn\u2019t take Sam Darnold, Josh Allen or Josh Rosen\u2014the three quarterbacks who went later in the top-10 of the draft.\n\nNew York Giants running back Saquon Barkley tries to elude San Francisco 49ers cornerback Jimmie Ward. Photo: cary edmondson/Reuters\n\nThe Giants weren\u2019t the only team to splurge at the position this off-season. The Cardinals did too, locking up Johnson for the long-term with one of the richest deals for a running back. And he has done little to move the needle for an offense averaging the fewest yards per game in the NFL.\n\nThe other side of the coin is Todd Gurley. The Rams locked up their star this off-season and made him the highest-paid back in the game. And Gurley has led the NFL in almost every statistical rushing category.\n\nBut the Rams aren\u2019t quite like the Giants or the Cardinals. They were a playoff team a year ago. They were in prime position to splurge on a luxury because they had the most important things already figured out. And they also could distinctly understand how much a running back is dependent on an offense\u2014and not vice versa: In 2016, behind a puttering offense, Gurley was one of the least effective running backs in the league."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": null, "title": "David Hockney Painting Sells for a Record $90.3 Million at Auction", "description": "A painting by British artist David Hockney sold for $90.3 million at Christie\u2019s in New York, a record for a living artist at auction.

With political uncertainty climbing, \u201cpeople are becoming much more aware of it,\u201d she said.\n\nBritain is slated to leave the EU on March 29. It would represent the first departure of a major economy from a comprehensive free-trade bloc in decades. On Thursday, a preliminary deal Mrs. May struck with Brussels on the terms of the exit triggered cabinet resignations. That heightens uncertainty about whether she can get the agreement through Parliament, or even retain power amid a revolt over the deal from a bloc inside her Conservative Party.\n\nThe government still has options, and parliamentary approval of the current draft deal isn\u2019t impossible. But with less than five months to go, the costs and logistical challenges for businesses of a no-deal Brexit are coming into sharper focus. The British pound, a sort of barometer for how Brexit talks have fared in recent months, fell sharply against the dollar on Thursday.\n\nU.K.\u2019s Theresa May Faces Turmoil Over Brexit Deal Less than 24 hours after a draft Brexit deal was announced, the U.K. prime minister faced resignations from senior ministers and strong vocal opposition from lawmakers in all corners of the U.K. Parliament. Image: Getty\n\nUnder an extreme no-deal scenario, companies in the U.K. will suddenly no longer get seamless access to EU markets. Executives and government officials on both side of the English Channel have warned of huge backlogs if customs officials must start inspecting goods moving between the U.K. and Europe. The U.K. government has warned that without a deal, goods that now move duty free would be subject to default World Trade Organization tariffs.\n\nThe transport, manufacturing and pharmaceutical sectors would be the hardest hit by a disorderly Brexit, some analysts say. BMW AG , which makes its Mini in England, is stockpiling parts and scouring the U.K. and Europe for warehousing space and parking lots\u2014in case trucks hauling cars or parts get stuck traveling between the two. Pharmaceutical firms have been ordered to stockpile drugs, and food companies are hoarding ingredients.\n\nThe British government has published dozens of technical papers outlining the different sectors affected once the U.K. exits the regulatory umbrella of the EU. They range from U.K. imports from Danish sperm banks to how London\u2019s massive derivatives market could be affected if suddenly cut off from EU clients.\n\nA shipping document sits behind the windscreen of a BMW-made Mini Countryman automobile in Killlingholme, U.K. Photo: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg News\n\nBut given the uncertainty about how Brexit plays out, a large number of smaller businesses aren\u2019t doing anything to prepare. A recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry found that 42% of British businesses had made no contingency plans for Brexit. Many can\u2019t afford the cost of making detailed fallback plans for something that may never happen.\n\nMany others are, though. James Flahavan, the seventh-generation owner of Edward Flahavan & Sons Ltd., an Irish maker of oatmeal, said his company is doubling stockpiles at warehouses in the U.K. ahead of the Brexit deadline.\n\nIrish businesses are especially vulnerable. Britain is Ireland\u2019s biggest export market after the U.S., but Irish businesses also move much of their non-U.K. destined orders through British ports. Multihog Ltd., an Irish tractor maker, has spent \u20ac5 million ($5.7 million), a third of the company\u2019s annual revenue, on preordering parts and stockpiling them, just in case.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to store parts,\u201d said Jim McAdam, Multihog\u2019s chief executive. But if a no-deal Brexit triggers new tariffs, or delays shipments at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., \u201cour whole business has to be turned off.\u201d\n\nIn some instances, the possible business repercussions of a no-deal Brexit are rippling beyond Europe. Kevin Hopper, managing director of Brian Yeardley Continental Ltd., a trucking company that specializes in transporting musicians and their gear, is flying this week to meet music executives in New York. Huge waits at British ports could make it slower to bus rock stars between gigs in London and Paris if Brexit goes badly, he plans to warn them. The situation is \u201cvery difficult to explain to American production managers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.K. government is drawing up its own contingency plans\u2014moves that seemed far fetched a year ago. The transport ministry is looking at leasing ferries to help bring in food and medicine, should London and Brussels fail to agree on customs regulations that would ensure exports and imports continue uninterrupted. The British army says it will help if need be.\n\nSome issues probably can\u2019t be mitigated by businesses alone. Take the trucking industry, for example. Once outside the EU, British truckers will need special permits to drive in the bloc. There are around 1,000 such permits allocated to the U.K. but some 38,000 trucks that regularly cross the English Channel, said Rod McKenzie at the U.K.\u2019s Road Haulage Association.\n\n\u201cThere is a disgraceful lack of government guidance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been left too late.\u201d Resolving the issue would likely require a bilateral treaty with France and Belgium, something that could take a while to negotiate.\n\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Dan Gallagher", "title": "Why PCs Still Compute - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Why PCs Still Compute Wall Street Journal In an era of folding smartphones, who knew the plain old personal computer could still be interesting?

Evidence of that came In the recently wrapped earnings season, where the strongest reports among large-cap techs came from the old \u201cWin-tel\u201d pair of Microsoft and Intel Corp.\n\nDespite a production shortage, Intel\u2019s PC chip division saw revenue jump 16% year over year to a record level above $10 billion. Investors may be focused on Microsoft\u2019s growing cloud business, but the division that includes licensing from its Windows operating system and sales of its Surface computing devices also saw revenue rise 15% year-over-year to $10.6 billion.\n\nPCs aren\u2019t exactly returning to their days of heady growth. According to IDC, global shipments in the first nine months of this year rose only 0.6% compared with the same period last year. But that comes after several years of declines. And it drives home the fact that for all the new types of computing devices that have emerged over the last decade, PCs remain the primary way most people get work done.\n\nConsider the reactions to Apple Inc.\u2019s unveilings last month of redesigned versions of its MacBook Air and iPad Pro. The latter is squarely aimed at business users, with Apple touting its performance capabilities against top-of-the-line laptop computers. But reviewers have been nearly unanimous in their reactions that even with all the tablet\u2019s enhancements, the device still can\u2019t quite replace a laptop for many tasks.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nWhich is not to say that tablets don\u2019t have their place. In fact, the decline of the PC market roughly coincides with the birth of the tablet market. Apple launched its first iPad in 2010, with several Android devices following soon after. PC shipments peaked globally at about 367 million units in 2011 and are now tracking about 29% below that number, according to IDC. For those who were buying lower-end PCs simply for the purpose of tasks like email and media consumption, the tablet offered a compelling and easier alternative.\n\nThat said, most of the corporate world still runs on Windows, Microsoft\u2019s ubiquitous operating system. And the life cycle of that platform still drives sales, even if on a somewhat delayed basis. According to Mika Kitagawa of Gartner, much of the recent uptick in PC sales stems from many businesses finally deciding to cycle out of Windows 7\u2014which Microsoft first issued in 2009\u2014to Windows 10, which has now been on the market for more than three years.\n\nThose businesses aren\u2019t just settling for the cut-rate towers of old. Shipments of what Gartner defines as premium ultramobile PCs\u2014a segment mostly made up of thin, top-of-the-line laptops\u2014jumped 16% last year and will grow another 8% this year, vastly outpacing the broader PC market.\n\nPC makers HP, Lenovo and Dell, which together comprise more than 60% of that market, finally took a page from Apple\u2019s design playbook and are now selling their own premium laptops. Many critics consider HP\u2019s Spectre series and Lenovo\u2019s Yoga series to be on par or even superior to Apple\u2019s MacBook devices. Premium PCs also tend to be better moneymakers. Gartner estimated in 2016 that gross margins on PCs priced over $1,000 can be as high as 25%, compared with 5% for PCs priced under $500.\n\nLenovo reported an 18% jump in sales for its PC division for the September quarter. HP and Dell\u2019s fiscal quarters ended in October.\n\nInvestors may rightly wonder if the PC market\u2019s current uptick is a blip. Alternative devices like tablets still pose competition as their capabilities improve. But PCs are benefiting from growing demand for premium devices, which helps raise average selling prices. And enterprise demand seems likely to keep up for a while, especially as Microsoft will be ending extended support for Windows 7 by early 2020.\n\nThe company said on its last earnings call that more than half of its enterprise installed base has now switched over to Windows 10, which also means plenty of upgrades remain to be done. For Intel, analyst Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research projects demand for the company\u2019s PC processors will grow in the low single digits.\n\nShares of Microsoft and Intel have also performed better than their large-cap tech peers, rising 6% and 8% since their respective earnings reports. Apple, Amazon.com and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. have averaged a loss of 8% since their own reports. The PC business may be aging, but it\u2019s not ready for retirement quite yet.\n\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jeffrey Sparshott", "title": "Real Time Economics: Taxes, Trade and a Troubled Brexit", "description": "This is the web version of the WSJ\u2019s newsletter on the economy.

Photo: Ian Vogler/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThis is the web version of the WSJ\u2019s newsletter on the economy. You can sign up for daily delivery here.\n\nInflation indexing is a mighty boring topic of conversation. But here's something interesting: Congress and the IRS are using it to get you to pay more taxes.\n\nGood morning. Jeff Sparshott here to take you through the day's top economic news. We also look at who's winning the U.S.-China trade fight, how to phone in a job interview, Theresa May's Brexit mess, and the link between marijuana and more babies. Let us know what you think by replying to this email.\n\n'CAUSE I'M THE TAXMAN\n\nLast year\u2019s big tax cut is about to start shrinking. The Internal Revenue Service is implementing a new method for making inflation adjustments that will cost Americans $133.5 billion over a decade. The tax law enacted last year lowered tax rates and reduced tax burdens for most households. It also required the IRS to switch to a different, slower-moving measure of inflation to adjust a variety of tax-code features, Richard Rubin reports. The standard deduction, tax brackets and other items will still increase most years, but now they will usually climb more slowly than they would have under the old formula.\n\nThe result: More income gets taxed, or taxed at higher rates. In 2019, for example, the standard deduction for a married couple will be $24,400. The deduction would have been $24,550 under the old inflation-adjustment method. The discrepancy will likely expand over time.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH TODAY\n\nU.S. industrial production for October, out at 9:15 a.m. ET, is expected to rise 0.2% from a month earlier.\n\nThe U.S. quarterly services survey for the third quarter is out at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThe Kansas City Fed's manufacturing survey for November is out at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nThe Chicago Fed's Charles Evans speaks on the economy and monetary policy at 11:30 a.m. ET.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nIMPORT SURGE\n\nImports into U.S. seaports are surging over usual seasonal patterns in an apparent push by retailers and manufacturers to pull orders forward ahead of a new round of tariffs set to hit U.S.-China trade in January. Ports in Southern California, Georgia and Virginia reported double-digit growth in import volume from September to October, setting monthly records as furniture, apparel, auto parts and other goods streamed in, Erica E. Phillips reports.\n\nDistortions caused by tariffs and other trade tensions could make it harder to get a true read on underlying economic trends. Separate data show China's exports to the U.S. jumped last month and the U.S.-China the trade gap is on track to be the widest on record this year. It's not entirely clear if that's because of stockpiling, a weaker yuan, strong demand or a mix of factors.\n\nWE ARE THE CHAMPIONS\n\nSo who's winning the U.S.-China trade spat? By President Trump's preferred measure, the trade deficit, China has the upper hand.\n\nFinancial markets are leaning toward the United States.\n\nWhich is right? \"It is very likely that Chinese exporters (and US importers of Chinese goods) will have front-loaded deliveries to the US in the months leading up to the US imposing the latest round of tariffs, thus flattering the figures. Once this process has finished, trade flows are likely to slow sharply,\" Oxford Economics's Adam Slater writes.\n\nOne possible leading indicator: China's official purchasing managers index, a gauge of activity in the critical manufacturing sector, dropped in October to its lowest level in more than two years. New orders for export are contracting.\n\nYOU'RE HIRED\n\nWant a job? Just pick up the phone. Eager employers trying to lure workers in the tightest job market in decades are hiring some candidates sight unseen, at times after one phone interview. The practice has become most common in seasonal work, particularly retail, although it is spreading among certain in-demand white-collar roles, such as engineers, IT professionals and teachers, Chip Cutter reports.\n\nCase study: Ashley Jurak, a 19-year-old student at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, offered to drive 90 minutes to her hometown of Dallas for an in-store interview with Bath & Body Works as she tried to nail down a position for the holiday break.

How do you write more eloquently than a man who wrote prose so fine it was deemed worthy (in 1953) of a Nobel Prize in literature?\n\nUnlike the politicians of today, Churchill wrote his own words. Those words were patriotic, humane and fortifying, and they united his nation in times of ordeal. They were also linguistically impeccable, and frequently handsome, even when he was writing purely for money. Churchill\u2019s language was the lifelong fruit of his having learned English grammar from a talented schoolmaster at Harrow. \u201cThus I got into my bones the essential structure of the ordinary British sentence,\u201d he wrote in \u201cMy Early Life,\u201d \u201cwhich is a noble thing.\u201d By the time of his death in 1965, at age 90, he had published 6.1 million words in 37 books\u2014more than Shakespeare and Dickens put together. And that\u2019s not counting his speeches, letters and memoranda.\n\nPortrait of Winston Churchill by David Jagger (1939). Photo: Estate of David Jagger\n\nChurchill: Walking With Destiny By Andrew Roberts\n\nViking, 1,105 pages, $40\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nBy some accounts, 1,000 biographies exist already of the man who was voted the greatest Briton of all time in a poll 16 years ago. And yet, forcing his way into this teeming herd of Churchill biographers, is another one, Andrew Roberts, whose \u201cChurchill: Walking With Destiny\u201d weighs in at 1,100 pages and cannot be read (as this reviewer will testify) without the support of a table.\n\nNo one\u2014not even Mr. Roberts, I suspect\u2014can possibly claim to have read every single Churchill biography. I have read six, including two notable duds (by Roy Jenkins and Boris Johnson, respectively); and there may well have been a sense among readers, until this latest book arrived, that tackling the Churchill story had become a matter of dwindling returns. We now have two reasons to be grateful to Mr. Roberts: the first is that his is unarguably the best single-volume biography of Churchill (and so good that it makes redundant Martin Gilbert\u2019s multi-volume labors); the second is that, as a result, no reasonable person will write a Churchill biography for years to come.\n\nIn his many public conversations about the book, Mr. Roberts has sought to justify adding to the Churchill pile by pointing to his access to sources hitherto unavailable, particularly the notes written in his diary by King George VI after his weekly lunches with Churchill during World War II. That is a gracious doff of the hat by Mr. Roberts to Britain\u2019s upright but dull-witted wartime king; in truth, the excerpts from the diaries tell us more about George VI than they do about his prime minister.\n\nAn example, from May 10, 1940: Neville Chamberlain is about to resign. When the king summons Churchill to ask him to become prime minister, he says to him: \u201cI suppose you don\u2019t know why I have sent for you?\u201d To which the mischievous Churchill responds: \u201cSir, I simply couldn\u2019t imagine why.\u201d As Mr. Roberts writes, \u201cit is clear from the King\u2019s own diary account that he genuinely thought Churchill did not know why he had been sent for, and took seriously Churchill\u2019s reply to what Churchill had thought was a joke.\u201d (The diary entry reads: \u201cI sent for Winston and asked him to form a government. This he accepted and told me that he had not thought this was the reason for my having sent for him.\u201d)\n\nMr. Roberts need not oversell the allure of his new regal sources, welcome though they may be. The book is a brilliant feat of storytelling, monumental in scope, yet put together with tenderness for a man who had always believed that he would be Britain\u2019s savior. At age 16, in 1891, Churchill told a friend that he could see \u201cgreat upheavals, terrible struggles; wars such as one cannot imagine.\u201d London, the disconcertingly clairvoyant young Churchill continued, \u201cwill be in danger, and in the high position I shall occupy, it will fall to me to save the capital and save the Empire.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe Gathering Storm,\u201d the first volume of his war memoirs, Churchill recalled the evening he became prime minister, only hours after Hitler launched his Blitzkrieg on Western Europe. \u201cI felt as if I were walking with destiny,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand that all my past life had been but a preparation for this hour and for this trial.\u201d Mr. Roberts has inhaled deeply of this Churchillian spirit, and his book is, in many ways, a chronicle of a life foretold.\n\nChurchill\u2019s childhood was a mix of the despondency and exhilaration that stayed with him till he died. Neglected by his beautiful American mother and treated callously by his aristocratic father (a direct descendent of the 1st Duke of Marlborough), he was loved and raised by his nanny (whom he called \u201cWoom\u201d and who called him \u201cWinny\u201d). He was a mutinous schoolboy, once telling the head-boy of Harrow, who was beating him on the bottom, that \u201cI shall be a greater man than you.\u201d In an early act of courage and chivalry, he took his nanny on a guided tour through his elitist school, eliciting jeers from the boys who stood by. \u201cThis lack of friendly support from conventional and priggish contemporaries,\u201d Mr. Roberts writes, \u201cwas to dog Churchill for almost the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nMr. Roberts\u2019s narrative structure follows an unfussy chronological pattern from birth to death, with everything in between. But there\u2019s not a moment\u2019s dullness in this book, with every account of his subject\u2019s many character flaws riveted to a larger context. \u201cHis obsession with the Empire,\u201d Mr. Roberts writes, \u201cwould help to bind its peoples together as it came under unimaginable stress, and his chauvinism left him certain that . . . the British would prevail over the Germans.\u201d\n\nChurchill was often disparaged for his pushiness\u2014in which judgment, Mr. Roberts says, there was an undercurrent of anti-Americanism. (Given Churchill\u2019s American mother, the writer Hilaire Belloc felt entitled to call him a \u201cYankee careerist.\u201d) Mr. Roberts explains Churchill\u2019s assertiveness as a product of his fear of dying young, which led him to live life at full pelt. \u201cChurchill believed he had only a short time to live, and regularly referred to his father\u2019s death at forty-five as the explanation for his own thrusting nature.\u201d\n\nFor all his erudition, Mr. Roberts is a popular historian, not an academic one, and he writes with the flair of a man who has made a living wielding his words for newspapers and magazines. His account of Churchill \u201cseizing the premiership\u201d in May 1940 is as compelling a tick-tock\u2014journalists\u2019 jargon for a blow-by-blow account of an event of a defined period of time\u2014as anything written for the front page of this newspaper.\n\nMr. Roberts stitches together with sublime skill the sequence of events that led to the passing of the baton of leadership from Chamberlain to Churchill\u2014bypassing Lord Halifax, the foreign secretary, who was also in contention for the prime minister\u2019s job, but whose membership of the House of Lords posed political problems. Halifax, writes Mr. Roberts, put national interest above personal ambition in ceding the premiership to the energetic, ambitious but not (at the time) widely liked Churchill.\n\nThe book is an unapologetic tribute to Churchill but not a hagiography. Mr. Roberts does not duck the difficult issues, such as the currently fashionable attribution to Churchill of responsibility for the horrific Bengal Famine of 1943. \u201cI hate Indians,\u201d he apparently told Leo Amery, his secretary of state for India and Burma. \u201cThey are a beastly people with a beastly religion.\u201d And yet, Mr. Roberts points out, the same Churchill praised \u201cthe unsurpassed bravery of Indian soldiers and officers.\u201d To those who assert that Churchill was responsible for a genocide-by-starvation in Bengal, Mr. Roberts says \u201cthe truth could not be more different.\u201d\n\nIn response to this and other morally awkward episodes in Churchill\u2019s life, Mr. Roberts plays the role not of apologist but of explicator. He goes to lengths to explain how shipping grain to Bengal in wartime\u2014whether from Canada or Australia\u2014was fraught with naval peril; besides, Churchill \u201csimply could not spare the shipping\u201d due to its need in military operations. \u201cTo reduce the desperately difficult moral decisions that Churchill and many others had to take to the level of accusations of deliberate genocide is biased and unhistorical,\u201d Mr. Roberts writes, while also raising questions that Indians themselves are inclined to duck in the general rush to pin blame on Churchill: What was the role played by Indian merchants who hoarded grain in the hopes of making a killing (as it were) as prices rose in a time of scarcity? And why did grain-rich Indian states not help to feed the people of Bengal?\n\nMr. Roberts\u2019s concluding chapter offers an admirably honest catalog of Churchill\u2019s many mistakes, culled from the longer treatment each one receives in the main body of the book. These include supporting the paramilitary Black and Tans in Ireland; backing Edward VIII during the abdication crisis; fighting against Indian self-government; rejoining the Gold Standard; and failing to appreciate the martial determination of the Japanese. Even as late as September 1941, Mr. Roberts writes, \u201cChurchill was still saying that the Japanese would climb down in the face of the Western oil embargo, whereas in fact it may have been the need for oil that drove the bellicose elements in the Japanese Government to put the Empire on the road to all-out war.\u201d\n\nAlongside this litany of errors, Mr. Roberts counterposes Churchill\u2019s many achievements, not least of which was, if one may put it this way, the salvation of Britain. \u201cThe important point about Churchill in 1940 is not that he stopped a German invasion that year,\u201d Mr. Roberts writes, \u201cbut that he stopped the British Government from making peace.\u201d And when it came to the three \u201cmortal threats posed to Western civilization, by the Prussian militarists in 1914, the Nazis in the 1930s and 1940s and Soviet Communism after the Second World War, Churchill\u2019s judgement stood far above\u201d that of those around him. Churchill, says Mr. Roberts, was \u201cthe last aristocrat to rule Britain.\u201d He may not have been of the people; but he was, in his own mind, always with them.\n\n\u2014Mr. Varadarajan is executive editor at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Paul Hannon", "title": "Theresa May Urges Unity Amid Brexit Turbulence - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Theresa May Urges Unity Amid Brexit Turbulence Wall Street Journal LONDON\u2014U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday appealed to her cabinet to stick together, a day after a wave of resignations thrust her terms for a departure from the Eur\u2026", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/theresa-may-urges-unity-amid-brexit-turbulence-1542359997", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37451/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T09:22:35Z", "content": "LONDONU.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday appealed to her cabinet to stick together, a day after a wave of resignations thrust her terms for a departure from the European Union into jeopardy.

But an existing procedure works for both: pilots flip switches to keep the plane from pushing the nose down. Windshield Throttle quadrant Yoke Yoke Cutoff\n\nJust eight days later, shortly after the Lion Air jet took off from Jakarta on Oct. 29, an angle-of-attack sensor on that flight sent incorrect data to flight-control computers, according to Indonesian and U.S. investigators. Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration later sent out high-priority safety warnings highlighting that the problem occurred. The resulting sequence of events is at the core of the international crash probe.\n\nBoeing and the FAA didn\u2019t have any immediate comment on the Southwest maintenance documents. The Southwest spokeswoman said the carrier replaced the two sensors in October on the same aircraft, and determined they weren\u2019t the source of the auto-throttle problem. Two other Southwest 737 MAX 8s had an angle-of-attack sensor replaced as part of routine maintenance due to external damage, such as an in-flight bird strike.\n\nSafety experts stress it\u2019s too early for definitive answers about the LIon Air tragedy because a host of other factors were at play. But so far, investigators suspect angle-of-attack problems may have touched off a flurry of interactions between various flight-control computers and pilot actions leading to the crash.\n\nWithin the next few weeks, Boeing and the FAA are expected to agree on a mandatory safety fix modifying some MAX 8 flight-control software, according to industry and government officials involved in or tracking the process. The most likely change, they said, will turn off automated nose-down commands in the event there is a wide disparity between angle-of-attack data flowing to the captain\u2019s and the co-pilot\u2019s cockpit displays. Some officials anticipate action as soon as two weeks.\n\nAs part of the cooperative American-Indonesian effort to unravel that complex interplay between automated systems and the Lion Air cockpit crew, investigators are now delving into lessons learned over the years about potentially dire consequences of defective or unreliable angle-of-attack indicators, according to U.S. government and industry safety experts.\n\nPlane makers and air-safety regulators have long realized and dealt with flight-control hazards stemming from such malfunctions on a number other models, including long-range Airbus SE A330 and A340 aircraft, as well as widely used A320 and A321 narrow-body jets from the European manufacturer.\n\nAn important aspect of the Lion Air probe is to examine whether Boeing engineers and technical managers\u2014overseen by the FAA\u2014fully incorporated those earlier lessons in designing cockpit automation for the 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 fleet. There are currently over 200 Max variants that have been delivered world-wide, out of thousands of 737s in total.\n\nCertification processes for new models \u201cinclude consideration for applicable lessons learned from in-service incidents and events,\u201d an FAA spokesman said in a written statement Thursday, but \u201ccare must be taken when making comparisons as aircraft systems are not all the same and respond differently to sensor inputs.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman confirmed that a look back at past safety events, including those prompted by angle-of-attack issues\u2014and how the agency responded to them\u2014is \u201cpart of the ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nSince the October crash, Boeing officials have declined to discuss specifics of the probe or the flight-control system now under scrutiny, saying they are helping and cooperating with investigators and regulators.\n\nWithout elaborating, the Chicago plane maker has said the latest 737 models are safe and pilots previously were provided adequate checklists to counteract hazards of repeated and automated nose-down commands. Boeing also has said it is \u201ctaking every measure to fully understand all aspects\u201d of the crash.\n\nBut at this point, much of the investigative work\u2014led by Indonesian authorities but assisted by U.S. crash investigators, regulators from the FAA and Boeing itself\u2014appears focused on potential hazards stemming from problematic angle-of-attack values.\n\nLion Air pilots have indicated that prior to the crash they weren\u2019t informed of the new flight-control system that has been implicated by investigators.\n\n\u201cNot just me, but others too,\u201d said Yusni Maryan, a senior pilot for the airline in Indonesia who flies the MAX jets. \u201c[Boeing] didn\u2019t specifically mention it.\u201d\n\nBoeing hasn\u2019t commented on communications with specific airlines or their pilots.\n\n\u2014Ben Otto contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com and Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Andy Pasztor", "title": "Southwest Air Replaced Flight-Control Sensors of the Kind Implicated in Lion Air Crash", "description": "During the three weeks before Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into waters off Indonesia, Southwest Airlines replaced two malfunctioning flight-control sensors of the same type that has been publicly implicated in the crash, according to a summary of Southwest mai\u2026", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/southwest-replaced-flight-control-sensors-of-the-kind-implicated-in-lion-air-crash-1542330689", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37414/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T04:32:39Z", "content": "During the three weeks before Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into waters off Indonesia, Southwest Airlines Co.

Windshield Throttle quadrant Yoke Yoke Cutoff\n\nJust eight days later, shortly after the Lion Air jet took off from Jakarta on Oct. 29, an angle-of-attack sensor on that flight sent incorrect data to flight-control computers, according to Indonesian and U.S. investigators. Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration later sent out high-priority safety warnings highlighting that the problem occurred. The resulting sequence of events is at the core of the international crash probe.\n\nBoeing and the FAA didn\u2019t have any immediate comment on the Southwest maintenance documents. The Southwest spokeswoman said the carrier replaced the two sensors in October on the same aircraft, and determined they weren\u2019t the source of the auto-throttle problem. Two other Southwest 737 MAX 8s had an angle-of-attack sensor replaced as part of routine maintenance due to external damage, such as an in-flight bird strike.\n\nSafety experts stress it\u2019s too early for definitive answers about the LIon Air tragedy because a host of other factors were at play. But so far, investigators suspect angle-of-attack problems may have touched off a flurry of interactions between various flight-control computers and pilot actions leading to the crash.\n\nWithin the next few weeks, Boeing and the FAA are expected to agree on a mandatory safety fix modifying some MAX 8 flight-control software, according to industry and government officials involved in or tracking the process. The most likely change, they said, will turn off automated nose-down commands in the event there is a wide disparity between angle-of-attack data flowing to the captain\u2019s and the co-pilot\u2019s cockpit displays. Some officials anticipate action as soon as two weeks.\n\nAs part of the cooperative American-Indonesian effort to unravel that complex interplay between automated systems and the Lion Air cockpit crew, investigators are now delving into lessons learned over the years about potentially dire consequences of defective or unreliable angle-of-attack indicators, according to U.S. government and industry safety experts.\n\nPlane makers and air-safety regulators have long realized and dealt with flight-control hazards stemming from such malfunctions on a number other models, including long-range Airbus SE A330 and A340 aircraft, as well as widely used A320 and A321 narrow-body jets from the European manufacturer.\n\nAn important aspect of the Lion Air probe is to examine whether Boeing engineers and technical managers\u2014overseen by the FAA\u2014fully incorporated those earlier lessons in designing cockpit automation for the 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 fleet. There are currently over 200 Max variants that have been delivered world-wide, out of thousands of 737s in total.\n\nCertification processes for new models \u201cinclude consideration for applicable lessons learned from in-service incidents and events,\u201d an FAA spokesman said in a written statement Thursday, but \u201ccare must be taken when making comparisons as aircraft systems are not all the same and respond differently to sensor inputs.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman confirmed that a look back at past safety events, including those prompted by angle-of-attack issues\u2014and how the agency responded to them\u2014is \u201cpart of the ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nSince the October crash, Boeing officials have declined to discuss specifics of the probe or the flight-control system now under scrutiny, saying they are helping and cooperating with investigators and regulators.\n\nWithout elaborating, the Chicago plane maker has said the latest 737 models are safe and pilots previously were provided adequate checklists to counteract hazards of repeated and automated nose-down commands. Boeing also has said it is \u201ctaking every measure to fully understand all aspects\u201d of the crash.\n\nBut at this point, much of the investigative work\u2014led by Indonesian authorities but assisted by U.S. crash investigators, regulators from the FAA and Boeing itself\u2014appears focused on potential hazards stemming from problematic angle-of-attack values.\n\nLion Air pilots have indicated that prior to the crash they weren\u2019t informed of the new flight-control system that has been implicated by investigators.\n\n\u201cNot just me, but others too,\u201d said Yusni Maryan, a senior pilot for the airline in Indonesia who flies the MAX jets. \u201c[Boeing] didn\u2019t specifically mention it.\u201d\n\nBoeing hasn\u2019t commented on communications with specific airlines or their pilots.\n\n\u2014Ben Otto contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com and Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Douglas Belkin", "title": "Dartmouth Lawsuit Says School Allowed 'Animal House' Culture", "description": "Seven current and former Dartmouth students filed a lawsuit in federal court, alleging the Ivy League school ignored an \u201cAnimal House\u201d atmosphere created by three professors.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dartmouth-lawsuit-says-school-allowed-animal-house-culture-among-professors-students-1542311799", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37308/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T03:27:30Z", "content": "Seven current and former Dartmouth College students filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Ivy League school on Thursday, alleging it ignored an Animal House atmosphere created by three professors in the schools department of psychology and brain scienc\u2026 [+3466 chars]", "fulltext": "Seven current and former Dartmouth College students filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Ivy League school on Thursday, alleging it ignored an \u201cAnimal House\u201d atmosphere created by three professors in the school\u2019s department of psychology and brain sciences.\n\nThe lawsuit, which seeks $70 million in damages, claims the professors \u201cleered at, groped, sexted, intoxicated and raped female students.\u201d It alleges the professors conducted meetings at bars, invited students to late-night hot tub parties in their homes and invited..."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Peggy Noonan", "title": "NOONAN: Misstep and Mystery...", "description": "NOONAN: Misstep and Mystery...

It\u2019s not formally defined yet entails many demands; it has an impact on history but no formal powers; it\u2019s the focus of all eyes, but people like to make it clear nobody elected you. Its locus is the East Wing, which the West Wing considers the silly place. You must be guided by tradition but be open to novelty so no one accuses you of being boring.\n\nMelania Trump has been a figure of sympathy, at least in this space, lauded for her grace, elegance and stoicism. She\u2019s married to a man who, emotionally and intellectually, is not exactly in the middle of the bell curve. She wound up in a job she never particularly wanted, in a time of unprecedented national division. She has done it pretty well. She has brought chic, American glamour and beautiful manners to the world\u2019s capitals. (There was the \u201cI Really Don\u2019t Care Do U?\u201d jacket, but at least that was spirited.) She humbly presented a gift in a Tiffany box to the Obamas on Inauguration Day, while her husband forgot to help her out of their car. She has self-control, and the independence to disagree with her husband\u2014when she said separating families at the border is no good, when she stood up for LeBron James after the president called him stupid. She\u2019s slapped his hand away when he gropily attempts to portray normal unity. She\u2019s put up with many scandals, some personally mortifying.\n\nSo it was a surprise to see her issue a hissy-fit of a statement about the deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel. \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\u201d Yowza.\n\nGranted, Ms. Ricardel\u2019s public reputation suggests she\u2019s quite a blunderbuss. But Mrs. Trump\u2019s statement added to\u2014and included her in, for the first time\u2014the White House\u2019s reputation for chaos, the sense that nobody\u2019s in charge, that it\u2019s all factions, head-butting and rumors about who\u2019s going to get fired next. Wednesday Politico had a quote from an unnamed former White House staffer describing the atmosphere: \u201cIt\u2019s like an episode of \u2018Maury.\u2019 The only thing missing is a paternity test.\u201d\n\nAlso it was kind of a Hillary Clinton move. It is not the first lady\u2019s job to hire and fire national-security staffers, any more than it was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s to design a new health-care system.\n\nModern first ladies are rarely sissies, but when they make their moves, they do so privately, not publicly. When Nancy Reagan didn\u2019t want someone around, she was peerless at planting the seed and upping the pressure. But she never made a public declaration that forced the public to have a view.\n\nThe oddest thing about Melania\u2019s statement is that it lessens her power. The essence of her power is that she is a mystery. No one knows what she\u2019s thinking. No one knows how she really views her husband and his presidency. She keeps herself apart and carries an air of deliberate opacity. She\u2019s never made the mistake of asking to be understood.\n\nNow, in moving aggressively, she has shocked Washington and provided an opening for already bubbling stories that actually she\u2019s rather willful and ignores good advice. Those stories will come.\n\nUnforced error.\n\nHere is what is for me the mystery of Michelle Obama: Like Melania she is glamorous and elegant, a beautiful woman and a disciplined one. I read her autobiography this week mostly to find the answer to a question.\n\nI always wondered, knowing something of her life: Did she understand how fortunate she was? She won the Trifecta. Does she know it?\n\nShe came from a good family, solid and stable, which successfully transmitted love. Her parents\u2019 economic circumstances were modest but stable\u2014it wasn\u2019t all foreclosures and moving and divorce and no money. And she was born with a solid, attaining mind, able to excel in academic work.\n\nThat is the Trifecta. People with that background these days are, no matter their color or economic level, almost American aristocracy. Solid family, solid framework, solid mind, built to rise\u2014a lot of working-class Americans, white or black, would thank their lucky stars to come from that background. Most of them have to deal with brokenness, chaos, love that never coheres. And those things make it so much harder to live healthy constructive lives.\n\nLove, stability and talent for something\u2014there are a million kinds of talent to have\u2014will set you firmly into the future. The rest is effort and luck, and Mrs. Obama had these too, working diligently and meeting a man with whom she could share an interesting life.\n\nI had this question because when she was first lady, she often seemed to me to carry with her an air not of gratitude but of grievance.\n\nThe book makes clear she did know how fortunate she was, though she has struggled to incorporate it into her attitudes.\n\nThe best part focuses on her childhood. Her parents were fabulous. \u201cMy father, Fraser, taught me to work hard, laugh often, and keep my word.\u201d Her mother, Marian, \u201cshowed me how to think for myself and use my voice.\u201d They provided guidance, order and affection. The Robinson family lived in the upstairs apartment of a tidy, two-story brick bungalow that was owned by a relative who taught piano and directed a church choir. It was in a middle-class, racially mixed neighborhood where people owned their homes. There were relatives all around.\n\nShe remembers sitting on her father\u2019s lap hearing him narrate a Cubs game. He loved jazz and art, had a solid union job for the city of Chicago, and wore a uniform to work. Her mother taught her to read early and took her to the public library.\n\nThis was an aspirational family.\n\nIt was hard for her to go from a racially mixed grade school to largely black classrooms, and later to a 90% white university, where she felt a differentness that was painful\u2014\u201cpoppy seeds in a bowl of rice.\u201d She was demoralized by assumptions she was there because of affirmative action.\n\nBut I wondered if she knows how universal, how apart from race, some of her more painful memories are. She had a terrible experience in high school with her college-placement counselor. Her heart was set on Princeton. The counselor looked at her record\u2014top 10% of her class, National Honor Society\u2014and issued a swift, dismissive judgment: \u201cI\u2019m not sure that you\u2019re Princeton material.\u201d Michelle was crushed, traumatized\u2014then galvanized: I\u2019ll show you.\n\nWhen I was entering high school my guidance counselor looked at my messy self, my up-and-down grades, and told me that in the future I might, if I applied myself, become a clerk or a secretary. College was not for me. I\u2019ll never forget that either. Even then, with nothing behind me, I was dreaming of something different. I didn\u2019t feel \u201cI\u2019ll show you!\u201d; I felt shame and confusion. It seemed early to write me off.\n\nAnd yet here we are.\n\nNever let idiots stop you.\n\nShe went to Princeton."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jon Kamp", "title": "Democrat Jared Golden Declared Winner in Maine House Race", "description": "Democratic challenger Jared Golden beat Republican incumbent Bruce Poliquin in a closely contested race for Maine\u2019s second congressional district, the secretary of state determined after running the state\u2019s unique ranked-choice tabulation process.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrat-jared-golden-apparent-winner-in-tight-maine-house-race-1542303849", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-35663/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T02:37:17Z", "content": "Democratic challenger Jared Golden beat Republican incumbent Bruce Poliquin in a closely contested race for Maines second congressional district, the secretary of state determined Thursday after running the states unique ranked-choice tabulation process.

A bipartisan proposal would correct some unfair federal sentencing practices, and Congress should grab the chance.\n\nOn Wednesday President Trump endorsed the First Step Act, which passed the House this year 360-59. Chuck Grassley and other Senators want to add reforms to mandatory minimum sentences, and the White House and Senators have been negotiating a version that might pass.\n\nThe main point of the bill is to offer federal convicts a better shot at returning to life as productive members of society, as most won\u2019t be in prison for life. The bill would open more opportunities for education or job training. Certain prisoners could earn good-behavior credits that would allow them to, say, move to a halfway house earlier. This is distinct from shaving time off a sentence. Fentanyl kingpins, terrorists and the most violent felons wouldn\u2019t be eligible for credits.\n\nOne reality of incarceration is the disruption to families and social connections that can encourage inmates to make better choices, and by one count 1 in 4 federal prisoners are more than 500 miles from home. The bill would try to move inmates closer to support networks.\n\nThe broader goal is to reduce recidivism, and the model is Texas, which implemented some of the same reforms like assessing how risky a prisoner is to society. Both violent crime and incarceration rates are falling in the Lone Star State, and Indiana, Kentucky and Mississippi are trying similar reforms.\n\nLong overdue is fixing mandatory sentences that have produced some outrageous results. One well-known case is Weldon Angelos, sentenced to 55 years for selling marijuana because a gun on the scene that wasn\u2019t used in the crime \u201cstacked\u201d more years on top. The judge, forced to issue the punishment, called it cruel and unjust. Another provision would offer retroactive relief to those punished more harshly for crimes involving crack than powder cocaine, an arbitrary distinction.\n\nMore controversial is a reduction in the mandatory minimum for a third drug offense to 25 years from life. By that time an inmate would be close to 50 years old or older, and locking up older inmates can be a waste of scarce resources. The change would only apply to sentences going forward, so the Bureau of Prisons won\u2019t release drug dealers en masse.\n\nTougher punishments like mandatory minimums have reduced the violent crime rate to the lowest in decades, but the public loses confidence in the system when punishment seems too severe for the crime. Judges could use the increased discretion the law would allow for, say, those with no history of violence who are cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nPolitical support ranges from GOP Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina to Democrat Chris Coons of Delaware\u2014and the proposal is likely to clear the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has seemed strangely cool on the prospect as he tries to allocate precious floor time before the end of the year.\n\nSome on the left don\u2019t think reform goes far enough, but why not take some progress when you can? It would also be instructive to find out how, say, New Jersey Democrat and presidential aspirant Cory Booker would vote. Would he oppose improvements on one of his own ostensible priorities because Mr. Trump might get a scintilla of credit?\n\nMr. Booker and Senator Kamala Harris of California sent around a letter earlier this year complaining about the bipartisan effort, which House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries derided as \u201criddled with factual inaccuracies.\u201d\n\nPassing these discrete measures would make it easier for Congress to build later on what works. Such incremental progress used to be standard procedure in Congress, and both parties now have a moment to put aside political cynicism and pass something that could improve American justice."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "The Editorial Board", "title": "The Ungracious Mr. Gillum", "description": "The Democrat loses the recount for Florida Governor but still won\u2019t concede.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ungracious-mr-gillum-1542329873", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37403/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:57:54Z", "content": "Florida finished its machine recount of close election races on Thursday, and Republican candidate for Governor Ron DeSantis retained his lead outside the 0.25% threshold for a hand recount.

But the German economy shrank 0.2% in the latest quarter, the first contraction since 2015.

Beijing last month said China\u2019s economy grew a surprisingly slow 6.5% year-on-year in its latest quarter, and that official figure is usually an overstatement.\n\nSome of this is due to such one-time factors as bad weather, but anxious markets are signaling larger concern. German auto exports are weak, and China is trying to sustain growth without adding to its debt overhang. The high-yield bond market has the jimmy legs, and oil prices are down on weaker demand.

Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government in London is hanging by a thread as she struggles to sell a European Union divorce deal to Parliament.\n\nThe world\u2019s fifth-largest economy could crash out of its most important trading relationship with no alternative in place. A disorderly Brexit could also usher in a socialist Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn, and watch the pound fall if that happens.\n\nAll of this is a warning for Mr. Trump and others in Washington: No moat can protect the U.S. economy, and they need to adapt.\n\nStart with the Fed, which should rethink its December rate increase. No other major central bank is likely to raise its rates soon. The Fed needs to weigh whether it should expand the gulf between U.S. and foreign monetary policies at a fragile moment as global investors demand more dollars.\n\nMr. Powell will be wary of seeming pliable amid Mr. Trump\u2019s demands for lower rates, but tighter credit conditions and low inflation support a pause independent of Mr. Trump\u2019s bluster. Now is not the time for a doctrinaire march toward \u201cnormalcy,\u201d which the Fed can resume in 2019 if the data warrant.\n\nMr. Trump should also settle his trade tempests. He wants Germany to export less, and look at the result after a quarter of soft auto sales abroad. Trade uncertainty is weighing on business investment much as Barack Obama\u2019s regulatory assaults did. If you\u2019re a CEO and don\u2019t know how global supply chains will be affected by tariffs or new trade deals, you delay investment.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s steel tariffs are still hitting Mexico and Canada even after the revised Nafta deal, and his 25% car tariff reappears now and again like Freddy Krueger. Adviser Peter Navarro suggested a long trade war with China last week, and stocks promptly sold off.\n\n***\n\nMr. Trump claims the U.S. economy is strong enough to ride out his trade wars. Well, how lucky does he feel? Last week the President suffered a bruising midterm election defeat even with a strong economy. If the U.S. starts to slow like its major economic partners, he\u2019s going to lose the 2020 election before anyone has time to \u201cwin\u201d a trade war.\n\nThis month\u2019s G-20 summit is a chance for Mr. Trump to show some economic statesmanship and look for a trade truce. This needn\u2019t be a show of weakness as he can continue negotiations to press market reforms abroad on China\u2019s intellectual-property theft or Europe\u2019s tax assaults on American tech companies. But he needs to signal that the U.S. won\u2019t continue punitive tariff attacks on allies.\n\nWith his polarizing political style, Mr. Trump even more than most Presidents will succeed or fail based on economic results. He should appreciate that a recession in the rest of the world is a threat to the U.S. economy and his Presidency."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Riva Gold", "title": "U.S. Stocks Close Higher Following Tech Rebound", "description": "U.S. stocks bounced back Thursday as technology shares staged a rebound, helping the S&P 500 snap a five-session losing streak.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-show-signs-of-stabilizing-1542271984", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37191/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:21:55Z", "content": "U.S. stocks bounced back Thursday as technology shares staged a rebound, helping the S&amp;P 500 snap a five-session losing streak.

He said the company\u2019s decision to compensate its former chief executive after PG&E was found negligent for a large 2010 gas explosion that killed eight people as well as its failure to replace its board \u201cleft us wondering is anyone ever accountable for failing to provide safety at PG&E.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI am very concerned that they don\u2019t have accountability in place.\u201d\n\nHe said his expanded review of the company could include whether to break it up into smaller utilities. \u201cWe will put all these things on the table,\u201d Mr. Picker said.\n\nThe commission had begun a review of whether PG&E\u2019s \u201corganizational culture and governance prioritize safety\u201d in 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Thursday evening downgraded the ratings of PG&E Corp.\u2019s debt, as well as the long-term ratings of the company\u2019s main utility subsidiary, Pacific Gas & Electric Co, and said all of the ratings for both are on review, which could result in a multi-notch ratings downgrade.\n\nThe developments capped a wild trading day in which shares of PG&E fell for the sixth straight day, then rebounded in after-hours trading, as investors grappled with the volatility that now comes with owning California\u2019s largest utility.\n\nPG&E shares fell more than 30% to close at $17.74 on Thursday amid investor concerns that the utility, already facing huge potential liability costs from 2017 wildfires, could be hit with even more costs related to a current fire in Northern California that has become the deadliest in state history, killing more than 50 people.\n\nBut the shares then shot up and recovered after hours in a roller-coaster ride for investors.\n\nPG&E has disclosed that a problem occurred on one of its high-voltage power lines in Northern California 15 minutes before the start of the Camp Fire was reported in the area Nov. 8. No definitive connection between the line outage and the fire has been made, and California fire investigators will likely take months to make a final determination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the cause of the fire has not been determined,\u201d PG&E spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo said in a statement. \u201cWe will cooperate with any investigations, and support the development of best practices and new policies to help prevent wildfires and protect the public.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s stock has been on a downward trajectory over the past six days as concerned investors confront yet another fire-related risk for the company, which is already grappling with more than 800 civil lawsuits from the 2017 fires. State investigators have concluded that PG&E equipment helped spark at least 16 of those fires last year.\n\nPG&E said it \u201cwasn\u2019t going to speculate or comment on what factors may or may not be impacting the stock market.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the new normal,\u201d said Michael Wara, head of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford University\u2019s Woods Institute. \u201cInvestors believe and are pricing in and acting as if PG&E will lose a few billion every year because of wildfire liability.\u201d\n\nEquity analysts estimate PG&E could face more than $10 billion in lawsuits and fines from fires in 2017 and from the Camp Fire this year. The company only has about $1.4 billion in insurance coverage for fires and about $13.2 billion in annual revenue from electricity sales.\n\nThursday\u2019s drop was the worst in the S&P 500, and the preliminary trading volume was the highest on record for the company. The steep fall in PG&E shares suggests investors believe the company may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, a move that would almost certainly wipe out shareholders.\n\nIn Paradise, Calif., investigators combed through neighborhoods reduced to ash, searching for human remains after the Camp Fire wildfire swept through the town. Photo: Erin Ailworth\n\nThe outlook for bond investors is more complicated. Many PG&E bonds were trading at discounts to their par value, indicating some concern about the company\u2019s prospects. But, in general, the selling was less intense in the bond market, as many bond investors expect the company to be able to largely pay its debts regardless of what happens with wildfire-liability claims.\n\nThe price of PG&E\u2019s most active issue, some $3 billion in 6.05% bonds which mature in 2034, gained more than 3 cents Thursday to 92.5 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess. Other PG&E bonds, which had been trading at distressed levels, also saw gains. The company\u2019s 4% bonds due in 2046 were up almost 4 points to 77.25 cents on the dollar.\n\nEarlier this week, PG&E drew down its full bank line of credit, a move many analysts saw as a sign its access to debt and equity markets might be limited. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether the company will have access to the capital markets at this time,\u201d said Jeffrey Cassella, an analyst with Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\n\nDespite the uptick in its bond prices Thursday, PG&E Corp., the parent of the utility, will be shut out of the market for bonds because it is now clear that highly destructive wildfires may be an annual event, said Andrew DeVries, a high-yield bond analyst at CreditSights. That raises the risk that lawsuits related to the wildfires would become a regular occurrence, he added.\n\nThe company\u2019s financial situation has led to speculation that it might need a bailout of some sort from the state of California. \u201cAs the company\u2019s cash position diminishes, the risk of bankruptcy could increase unless politicians intervene,\u201d wrote Mizuho Securities USA LLC analyst Paul Fremont.\n\nEarlier this year, California passed legislation that would allow utilities to securitize wildfire liability by floating bonds and passing on the costs to ratepayers under certain circumstances. But the law takes effect in January, leaving utilities exposed to liabilities that could occur as a result of fires in 2018.\n\nCiti analyst Praful Mehta said the stock selloff reflects investors\u2019 concerns that California might not act to help PG&E offset potential liability costs arising this year if the move is viewed as a bailout. \u201cPolitically, it could be very challenging,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the political will isn\u2019t there, the only way this could get resolved is to push it into restructuring.\u201d\n\nUtility stocks are usually seen as somewhat boring investments that deliver predictable dividends. But PG&E has become a stock without a dividend or the prospect of one for the foreseeable future. The company cut the dividend earlier this year to preserve cash in anticipation of mounting liability costs after the 2017 fires.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually considered a safe investment,\u201d said David Spence, a professor who teaches energy law at the University of Texas, referring to PG&E stock, \u201cbut it\u2019s not looking very safe right now.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sam Goldfarb, Patrick Thomas and Soma Biswas contributed to this article.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to PG&E Corp. as PGE Corp. in one instance.

Walmart executives said same-store results, which exclude volatile gasoline sales, will show growth of at least 3% for the full fiscal year ending in January.\n\nOther major U.S. chains are reporting mixed results, a sign that not all retailers are benefiting from the strong job market and rising wages. The Commerce Department said Thursday that American consumers picked up their spending in October after two consecutive months of declining retail sales.\n\nShares of Walmart and other retailers declined on Thursday as investors worried that profits aren\u2019t keeping pace with sales gains because companies are investing in workers\u2019 wages and lowering prices to compete with Amazon. Despite its sales growth, Walmart\u2019s profit margins narrowed in the latest quarter.\n\n\u201cProfitless growth is now the best case\u201d for most retailers this year, Simeon Gutman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a note to clients.\n\nAmong traditional retailers, there is a divide between those that are adapting to the rise of online shopping and those still struggling to attract customers. Sears Holdings Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection last month capping years of declining sales and store closures.\n\nOn Wednesday, Macy\u2019s Inc.

Penney Co. on Thursday reported lower sales and a $151 million quarterly loss. Penney\u2019s chief executive, Jill Soltau, who joined the department store last month, said it needs to do a better job clearing excess inventory and understanding what its customers want.\n\nNordstrom Inc., JWN -0.81% which caters to higher-end customers, said same-store sales rose 2.3% but the gains were driven by its off-price Nordstrom Rack chain. The increase at its full-price department stores was just 0.4%\n\nNordstrom\u2019s net income fell to $67 million from $114 million a year earlier, hurt by a charge to repay credit-card holders with delinquent accounts who were improperly charged higher interest rates beginning in 2010.\n\nAt Walmart, total quarterly revenue was $124.9 billion, an increase of 1.4% as lower international sales and currency translations slowed the overall gains.\n\nWalmart shed control of its operations in Brazil and is merging its U.K. operations with a rival to focus on its domestic business and e-commerce operations.\n\nProfit attributable to Walmart was down 2.2% from the year-earlier quarter at $1.71 billion, or 58 cents a share.\n\nRelated Video The retail industry is undergoing another major shift\u2014to e-commerce.

The company\u2019s online segment currently operates at a loss.\n\nWalmart\u2019s stock slipped 2% to $99.54 on Thursday. The shares had been trading near their record high of $109.98, and yet are little changed from where they started the year.\n\nIn the U.S., Walmart said sales growth was driven by market-share gains in groceries, household goods and other categories.\n\nExecutives highlighted demand for fresh food and apparel, including Walmart\u2019s house brands, as well as toys as the company expanded its selection after the collapse of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. It is selling 30% more toys in stores and 40% more toys online this fall versus last year.\n\nWalmart expects its e-commerce operations to record a slightly greater operating loss next year.\n\nCEO Doug McMillon said it aims to get closer to profitability by selling more items that are higher-margin, if infrequent, purchases, in addition to common household goods. \u201cThe process takes time, and we\u2019re making progress,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile most of its U.S. sales come from groceries, Walmart has added trendy fashion to its online assortment. In the past year, it has struck a deal to sell apparel from Lord & Taylor through Walmart.com and acquired online lingerie seller Bare Necessities and plus-size clothing brand Eloquii. Walmart previously acquired men\u2019s fashion site Bonobos and women\u2019s clothing seller ModCloth.\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest retailer is reviewing every item expected to be subject to tariff-related increases in the coming months, discussing with suppliers ways to reduce costs, executives said. \u201cThe teams are hard at it,\u201d and merchandising executives are traveling overseas to study the issue, said Walmart\u2019s U.S. chief, Greg Foran, on a call with reporters.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nIn the U.S., Walmart aims to use its position as the country\u2019s largest grocery seller to outpace Amazon.

A speech last week by Peter Navarro, director of the White House\u2019s Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, helps explain why. The author of \u201cDeath By China\u201d invoked a real-estate analogy to justify his protectionism.\n\n\u201cRunning up a trade deficit every year . . . of over half a trillion dollars,\u201d Mr. Navarro said, is \u201ca pure transfer of wealth abroad: jobs, factories, money. That\u2019s like a reverse mortgage on this country.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s encouraging that President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has since criticized Mr. Navarro\u2019s speech. But the notion that the trade deficit is comparable to a homeowner\u2019s reverse mortgage reflects the muddled thinking behind trade-war ideology.\n\nNormal mortgages are home loans paid back over time. In a reverse mortgage, the bank makes payments to the homeowner in exchange for home equity. This often allows older homeowners to get cash to live on while staying in their homes. But because the loan is ultimately paid back through the sale of the house, people with reverse mortgages usually can\u2019t pass along their most valuable asset to their heirs.\n\nSeniors living on borrowed time and money while bankers drain their children\u2019s inheritance makes for a potent image of decline. Which brings us to Mr. Navarro\u2019s view of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe trade adviser\u2019s comparison suggests that because Americans run a trade deficit with countries like China, they are incurring a debt that will have to be repaid like a bank loan against a home. But national accounting is different from household accounting.\n\nFirst, the trade deficit reflects only one side of a national accounting ledger. Whereas a homeowner might never see his money or house again after repaying the bank for a reverse mortgage, that\u2019s not true for nation-states. When Americans send dollars abroad to buy Chinese shoes, those dollars will likely come back in the form of capital inflows.\n\nThat\u2019s why the U.S. capital account, which measures net investment in the country, has a capital surplus equal to the U.S. trade deficit. Chinese shoe salesmen who receive American dollars choose to reinvest greenbacks in dollar-denominated assets. This investment then produces more factories and jobs in the U.S.\u2014something protectionists inexplicably ignore.\n\nMr. Navarro\u2019s analogy also suggests trading at a deficit diminishes U.S. assets\u2014jobs, factories and money\u2014just as a reverse mortgage bleeds equity from a home. But the U.S. trade deficit has increased 10% year-on-year as of September, and all the while the economy has soared: Unemployment is at record lows; wages are increasing at the highest rate in a decade; and U.S. manufacturing expanded in September at the fastest rate since May 2004, according to the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nThis is not a coincidence. For most of the 20th century, U.S. trade deficits coincided with robust growth. Trade deficits mean domestic consumers are spending to improve their quality of life, and foreigners are investing in the U.S. and creating jobs. Mr. Navarro should know that the economy is humming despite the administration\u2019s protectionism, not because of it.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit arises from Americans importing more than they export, partly because businesses and consumers spend more than they save. But unlike a homeowner\u2019s debt to one bank, aggregate debt from U.S. overconsumption is spread over the whole economy. It might take the form of corporate bonds or private auto loans. The federal deficit, on the other hand, represents debt to be repaid by the taxpayers. But that is due to massive entitlement and discretionary spending, not an excess of imports.\n\nMr. Kudlow called Mr. Navarro\u2019s speech \u201ca great disservice\u201d to the president because of its threats to Wall Street for its trade-policy advocacy. As troubling is Mr. Navarro\u2019s illogical protectionism and the prospect that President Trump is still listening.\n\nMr. Gayou is an assistant editorial page writer at the Journal."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Eliot Brown", "title": "Cryptocurrency Hangover Weighs on Nvidia", "description": "Nvidia shares tumbled 18% after the chip maker projected declining revenue for the current quarter as it works through excess inventory left over from the cryptocurrency boom.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidia-misses-forecasts-as-gaming-data-center-businesses-lag-1542320328", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37388/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:11:49Z", "content": "Nvidia Corp.

Chicago families could escape the summer heat and shuttle above Lake Michigan to Indiana beaches in less than half an hour. These trips often take an hour or two on the ground, but electric air taxis will allow for speedy urban travel without the headaches of flying coach.\n\nThe air-taxi dream has been revived thanks to repeated high-tech shocks. Battery improvements are making passenger drone flights feasible. Ride-sharing and routing software, used by Uber and Lyft, makes complex fleet management possible. Technology developed for self-driving cars will one day automate pilot functions, overcoming the greatest hurdles to a flying-taxi industry: high labor costs and the risk of human error.\n\nThe industry is moving faster than anyone has recently predicted. Take Voom, an app that matches helicopter pilots with passengers. It started servicing passengers in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2017, and its rapid success led to a March debut in traffic-clogged Mexico City. In the U.S., Boeing recently announced plans to test a piloted air taxi in 2019. Uber has similar plans for Dallas and Los Angeles in 2020, with an eye toward autonomous flight.\n\nAir-taxi flights are pricey today, but costs are expected to fall. A representative from Lilium, a European operator, predicted in October that its electric five-seat air taxis will complete the Manhattan-JFK shuttle for $36 a person, significantly cheaper than cab fares, and that the price will eventually fall to $6 once flights become autonomous. The standard prediction, offered by Porsche Consulting and others, is for commercialization of air taxis to occur around 2025, but that may be overly pessimistic.\n\nBottlenecks for the U.S. air-taxi industry are now due to federal and state regulations, not the technology. Congress held two hearings about air taxis this summer, but the industry witnesses spent far more time wowing members\u2014these are flying cars, after all\u2014than discussing regulatory barriers to commercialization.\n\nThe U.S. has advantages, but its companies are falling behind. Chinese drone company Ehang conducted the first-ever pilotless air-taxi flight in February, carrying human passengers on a 9-mile route. U.S. regulations and busy national airspace will probably delay such flights for several more years. U.S. cities lack the helicopter infrastructure of S\u00e3o Paulo and Mexico City, and the proliferation of airports across the U.S. limits the amount of available airspace for air taxis. In China, which already boasts extensive drone delivery services, relatively \u201cclean\u201d airspace makes rapid development more likely.\n\nU.S. lawmakers can help encourage investment and deployment. For one, air-travel safety regulations should be modernized so passengers can breeze through check-ins. Replicating the inefficiencies of the airport-security line would counteract the air taxis\u2019 speed advantage. Autonomous flights have no pilots, so air taxis cannot be hijacked, though other threats endure.\n\nRegulators should demarcate and auction aerial corridors\u2014virtual highways in the sky\u2014as government auctions radio spectrum and offshore windmill sites. This would protect existing air traffic and create flexibility for air-taxi commercialization. Local leaders should also scrutinize zoning laws and noise ordinances that would forbid air taxis, which are notably quieter than helicopters.\n\nPressure on lawmakers to jump-start this futuristic mode of transportation will build. As Americans learn more, many will cast a gaze upward and realize there are empty highways beckoning in the sky. It\u2019s something to think about next time you\u2019re stuck in traffic.\n\nMr. Skorup is a senior research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and author of a new study on \u201cAuctioning Airspace.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jennifer Maloney", "title": "FDA Seeks Ban on Menthol Cigarettes", "description": "The FDA said it would seek a ban on menthol cigarettes.

More than a dozen municipalities have adopted bans on menthols, but cigarette makers have so far avoided federal restrictions.\n\nOn Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration said it was working on banning menthol-flavored cigarettes and cigars. A rule could take a year or more to finalize, and another year for it to be enforceable in the marketplace.\n\nThe agency also placed restrictions on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, to be implemented over the next several months, and said it would soon direct tobacco companies to pull some flavored cigars off the market. It is working on a separate rule to ban flavored cigars entirely.\n\nA spokesman for Reynolds American Inc., raised the possibility of a legal battle over a ban on menthols. Reynolds makes Newport, the leading U.S. menthol brand. He disputed the FDA\u2019s conclusions on the health effects of menthols and said a ban would expand the underground market, increasing rather than decreasing teens\u2019 access to cigarettes.\n\nThe FDA concluded in 2013 that menthols are harder to quit and likely pose a greater health risk than regular cigarettes. But it wasn\u2019t until last year that the agency signaled it was considering a ban on menthol and other flavored tobacco products.\n\nBritish American Tobacco PLC has the most at stake. It spent about $50 billion three years ago to take full control of Reynolds American. In 2016, menthols represented about half of Reynolds\u2019s $12.5 billion revenue.\n\nAltria Group Inc. sells menthol-flavored Marlboros and Imperial Brands PLC sells the Kool and Salem brands, but those companies aren\u2019t as reliant on menthols for overall sales. Reynolds, Altria and Imperial all said they would be engaged throughout the FDA\u2019s yearslong rule-making process.\n\nFrom the Archives An FDA committee report says that removing menthol cigarettes from the market would benefit public health. The cigarettes have been marketed to African-Americans for years. (Originally published Jan. 4, 2011)\n\n\u201cA total ban on menthol cigarettes or flavored cigars would be an extreme measure not supported by the science and evidence,\u201d Altria said.\n\nMenthol, a compound that occurs naturally in mint plants, has been added to cigarettes since the 1920s. It provides a cooling sensation in the mouth and throat, similar to that of a mentholated cough drop. Health officials said that eases the throat irritation caused by cigarette smoke, making menthols more appealing to young people.\n\nJeff Washington, a 52-year-old New Yorker who started smoking Newports when he joined the Army as a teenager in 1983, said that if menthols were banned, \u201cI\u2019d start smoking Marlboros.\u201d\n\nThe tobacco industry in the 1990s fought the prospect of federal regulation, but in 2000 Philip Morris Cos., the company now known as Altria, came out in favor of federal oversight, giving it a seat at the table as the parameters were set for any future menthol ban. The company took part in negotiations on legislation passed in 2009, giving the FDA regulatory control of tobacco products. The law banned candy, fruit and spice flavorings in cigarettes because of their potential appeal to children, but it left unsettled the issue of menthol.\n\nThe 2009 law said the FDA could prohibit menthols only if it could demonstrate that a ban was a net benefit to public health, taking into account potential unintended consequences such as an illicit market. The agency since then has been working on overcoming that hurdle.\n\nTurning to the courts is a tactic that has worked for the tobacco industry before. Several companies in 2011 successfully sued to block the FDA from mandating large graphic warning labels on cigarette packs, arguing it violated their First Amendment rights. Such package warnings have been adopted by many countries.\n\nReynolds spent $11.7 million to fight a menthol ban adopted last year in San Francisco and upheld this June in a ballot measure. It also funded black community leaders who spoke out against municipal menthol bans, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, who argued they would create an illicit market, causing police to racially profile blacks. Mr. Sharpton didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nOver the decades, minorities gravitated to menthol brands such as Newport, Kool and Salem as tobacco companies ran magazine and billboard ads depicting carefree black smokers. The companies also encouraged the belief that menthols were soothing and had a medicinal effect.\n\nCigarette ads from the 1970s, like this one for Newport, often targeted African-Americans with pitches about the \u201ccool\u201d flavor of menthol. Photo: Advertising Archive/Everett Collection\n\nIn the U.S., 81% of black smokers and 46% of Hispanic smokers used menthols in 2017, compared with 29% of white smokers, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Some 45% of children ages 12 to 17 who smoke said they use menthols, according to the data. For black teens, that figure is 52%.\n\n\u201cMenthol is an on-ramp to smoking for kids,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Thursday on a call with reporters. \u201cThe burning, the coughing that comes with that first cigarette\u2026is masked by the menthol.\u201d\n\nDr. Gottlieb said as a physician, he had seen firsthand the disproportionate health effects to which menthol cigarettes contribute among African-Americans and underserved communities. \u201cIt is an awful way to die,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a step toward a potential ban, the FDA in March sought public comment on the role of menthol and other flavors in tobacco products. British American, Altria and other tobacco companies submitted their views to the agency.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s 2013 findings on menthol \u201csuffered from fundamental scientific flaws,\u201d Altria said in its July submission, adding that a ban on menthols would likely create a substantial illicit market.\n\nThe National Association of Convenience Stores says a menthol ban \u201cwill only shift those sales to the black market. Black-market sellers of tobacco products do not check the ages of their purchasers, do not pay taxes on their sales, and sell more than just menthol cigarettes.\u201d\n\n\u201cA ban on menthol cigarettes would give police another way to interact negatively in black communities,\u201d Mr. Sharpton wrote in an op-ed he co-wrote in May 2017. \u201cA ban, prohibition or restriction on menthol cigarettes would mean punitive consequences.\u201d\n\nThe NAACP and the National Urban League said this week they would support a federal ban on menthols. The FDA\u2019s plan \u201cis long overdue to protect the health of African-Americans and to reduce the deleterious impact of menthol smoking and tobacco use overall on America\u2019s health,\u201d Marjorie Innocent, the NAACP\u2019s senior director of health programs, said Wednesday.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cWhy just single out one type of cigarette?\u201d asked Rasheem Chisholm, 46, of Brooklyn, who is trying to break his 20-year Newport habit. \u201cIt\u2019s no good.

Trump critics should consider the risk of betting their political fortunes on special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe Mueller probe has lost its political potency, as Democrats acknowledged on the midterm trail. They didn\u2019t win House seats by warning of Russian collusion. They didn\u2019t even talk about it. Most voters don\u2019t care, or don\u2019t care to hear about it. A CNN exit poll found 54% of respondents think the Russia probe is \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d; a 46% plurality disapprove of Mr. Mueller\u2019s handling of it.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Democrats from fixating on it since the election, in particular when President Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and named Matthew Whitaker as a temporary replacement. The left now insists the appointment is unconstitutional or that because Mr. Whitaker once voiced skepticism on the Russia-collusion narrative, he is unfit to oversee the Mueller investigation and must recuse himself.\n\nThe joke here is that neither Mr. Whitaker nor anybody else is likely to exercise any authority over Mr. Mueller\u2014and more\u2019s the pity. The probe has meandered along for 18 months, notching records for leaks and derivative prosecutions, though all indications are it has accomplished little by way of its initial mandate.\n\nAs a practical matter, Mr. Mueller should have been brought to heel some time ago. As a political matter, that won\u2019t happen. The administration has always understood that such a move would provoke bipartisan political blowback, ignite a new \u201ccoverup\u201d scandal, and maybe trigger impeachment. It\u2019s even more unlikely officials would risk those consequences now, as Mr. Mueller is said to be wrapping up.\n\nDemocrats know this, as does the grandstanding Sen. Jeff Flake. Yet they demand a Whitaker recusal and are again pushing legislation to \u201cprotect\u201d the special counsel\u2019s probe. Senate Republicans rightly blocked that bill this week, partly on grounds that it is likely unconstitutional. They also made the obvious point that if Mr. Trump intended to fire Mr. Mueller, he\u2019d have done so months ago and wouldn\u2019t need to ax Mr. Sessions to do it. And while the president tweets ceaseless criticism of the probe, he has never threatened to end it.\n\nDemocrats are nonetheless doubling down on the probe for political advantage. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared members of his caucus will demand that language making it more difficult to fire Mr. Mueller be included in a spending bill that needs to pass before the end of the current legislative session. Mr. Flake is offering an assist, saying that he will block any judicial nominees in committee until a Mueller protection bill gets a Senate floor vote. Over in the House, incoming Democratic committee chairmen, led by soon-to-be Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, are vowing an investigation blitz focused on collusion with Russia.\n\nMr. Schumer\u2019s last shutdown\u2014a year ago\u2014was a bust even though it was waged over the emotionally compelling issue of Dreamers, illegal aliens brought to the U.S. as children. He now proposes shutting down the government over a probe few people outside of Washington care about. Mitch McConnell should be so lucky.\n\nMr. Flake, should he run for president, will struggle to explain to conservative voters his obstruction of Trump judicial nominees, who\u2019ll be confirmed in 2019 anyway when the Republicans expand their Senate majority.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 other problem is that this strategy hinges in large degree on an expectation that Mr. Mueller ultimately finds something. There\u2019s no reason to believe he has turned up any evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.\n\nSure, he\u2019s secured convictions against longtime Beltway bandits for long-ago lobbying. He\u2019s squeezed the ole standby lying-to-investigators plea out of a few targets. He\u2019s indicted a squad of Russian trolls, who will never be brought to trial and who even Mr. Mueller\u2019s office admits had nothing to do with the Trump team. And while it seems likely his report to the Justice Department will criticize Mr. Trump, it\u2019s improbable it will contain proof of collusion.\n\nAnd then? The president will have a field day. He will claim vindication and mercilessly drive home that the investigation was a waste and a witch hunt. And he will have a point. Two years of Democratic hyperbole will be undercut by the special counsel they\u2019ve held out as the ultimate sleuth. They\u2019ll have to decide whether to deride Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings as insufficient to justify continuing their own probes.\n\nMaybe Mr. Mueller has something. We\u2019ll see. But if the reporting is correct that he\u2019s wound up high and dry, Democrats will end up there with him.\n\nWrite to kim@wsj.com."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Dutch Ruppersberger", "title": "I Won't Vote to Fund the Border Deployment", "description": "It\u2019s a wasteful political stunt.

(Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Photo: Heritage Images/Getty Images\n\nIf Donald Trump were inclined to think historically, he might reflect on the solution that Henry IV hit upon after eight bloody religious wars between Catholics and Protestant Huguenots in France between 1562 and 1598. Some three million people are said to have died.\n\nIn a stroke of conciliatory genius, Henry, a Protestant, converted to Catholicism: \u201cParis is worth a mass,\u201d he is supposed to have said. Later he signed the Edict of Nantes, which granted concessions to Huguenots and damped sectarian fires. What resulted was not the peaceable kingdom, but at least the French gave up the practice of religious massacre for a time.\n\nAmerica\u2019s present division, Trumpians vs. progressives, is essentially sectarian; the country is divided between two religions. \u201cAll right we are two nations,\u201d the novelist John Dos Passos wrote in his \u201cU.S.A.\u201d trilogy when considering the Sacco-Vanzetti case, which split the country in the 1920s. \u201cTwo nations\u201d is not necessarily a bad thing. America has generally expanded its idea of itself, and broadened its democracy, by struggling through conflicts of its contending faiths, value systems and ethnic components: thesis, antithesis, synthesis. It is as if the country came with an embedded scheme of binaries\u2014colonial revolutionaries vs. loyalists, immigrants vs. nativists, whites vs. blacks, old Eastern elites vs. Western Jacksonians, North vs. South, rural vs. urban, wets vs. dries, labor vs. management, and so on\u2014that had to be fought over and resolved.\n\nAt the Democratic convention in 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke of his enemies in the business and financial world as \u201ceconomic royalists.\u201d \u201cI welcome their hatred!\u201d he said later. It was French Revolution talk\u2014Roosevelt as Robespierre. A president could not speak more divisively than that. Yet arguably Roosevelt saved capitalism. After that, it was not FDR but Pearl Harbor, a brilliant but ultimately fatal outside-the-box gesture by the Japanese, that led to the end of the Depression and united the badly divided Americans in a titanic war.\n\nThere always seems to be a thesis (French Catholics, say) and an antithesis (Huguenots) and then, in the course of events, a synthesis (Henry\u2019s conversion and the Edict of Nantes). Sometimes the synthesis is a long time coming\u2014as has been the case with race in America.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is not Henry IV. Synthesis is not his way. He does not yet grasp that his compulsion to create chaos\u2014sometimes an asset\u2014may ultimately prove to be the greatest threat to his presidency.\n\nPeople are either conciliators or confrontationists. Mr. Trump is a confrontationist. He will not kneel at the altar of the progressives\u2019 church\u2014nor will he betray the faith of those who sustain him, those widely derided as \u201cthe base\u201d by progressives who half-consciously invest the word with its second meaning: low and degraded. Mr. Trump is sustained by the base; progressives are the exalted ones.\n\nHenry IV became a Catholic only after decades of religious civil war in France. It\u2019s possible that America\u2019s religious wars are only starting, and that the Edict of Nantes is a long way off.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s game, meantime, is agitation: dancing into and out of conflict, making his own rules. The self-generated and manically inner-directed drama gives him energy, and above all it gives him that freedom to act\u2014a freedom that his enemies consider dangerous to the Constitution and the country, but that his supporters find both satisfying and productive.\n\nHe has the 2020 re-election campaign to think of now, and he has Robert Mueller, still maneuvering out there beyond the radar. Mr. Trump presumably means to stick with the style of vivid effrontery that has brought him this far.\n\nIn President Trump, we behold an evolving dilemma. Americans\u2014whatever their cultural divisions\u2014will yearn increasingly for an end to the craziness and for a different, calmer personality in the White House. But Mr. Trump can never betray himself by becoming a normal human being. There are three possibilities: He will transcend himself (and who knows what that would look like), or he will destroy himself, or he will somehow manage, through it all, to go on being Donald Trump.\n\nMr. Morrow, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, is a former essayist for Time."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Matthew Hennessey", "title": "How to Read 'Body' Language", "description": "The left adopts an odd dysphemism for human beings.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-read-body-language-1542326857", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37050/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:07:38Z", "content": "One of the most vexing recent developments in the world of words is the tendency to refer to human beings as bodies.

If public anger about past coverups wasn\u2019t enough to spur church leaders into action, the pressure of more than a dozen state investigations presents an ultimatum, forcing bishops to prove they are able to police their own affairs. Yet on the eve of the conference in Baltimore, the Vatican forbade the bishops to adopt practical reforms. The move tears the U.S. church between the authority of Rome and the trust of its followers.\n\nTwo abuse stories have battered the American church since the summer: the uninhibited rise of a serial sexual predator, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, and the Pennsylvania grand-jury report, which unveiled sex-crime accusations against more than 300 priests. The bishops\u2019 lack of accountability connects the two stories. Equal among themselves under Catholic law, bishops can\u2019t discipline each other without Vatican intervention. This enables them to cover up abuse in their own jurisdictions\u2014and gives them an excuse to keep quiet about others.\n\nAhead of the conference, the bishops coalesced around two proposals to impose accountability. The first is a simple code of conduct extending to bishops the zero-tolerance policy for sex abuse enacted for priests in 2002. The second is an independent review board to investigate claims against bishops and refer credible cases directly to the Vatican. \u201cEach bishop would have to agree to allow himself to be investigated by the committee,\u201d San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone told me last week. He described the bishops\u2019 shedding of immunity as \u201ca covenantal sort of relationship\u201d that would allow them to police each other better.\n\nYet the Vatican\u2019s surprise announcement means the new covenant will have to wait. The Holy See barred the conference from voting on new sex-abuse protocols until after a summit in Rome this February. Naturally, the bishops were shocked when they received the news Monday morning. Instead of returning to their dioceses with a concrete agreement, they\u2019ll bring nothing but assurances of future reforms. More than 15 years after the sex-abuse crisis first surfaced in the U.S., such promises do little to quell public anger or ease prosecutorial pressure.\n\nThe delay shows that the Vatican simply doesn\u2019t place the same value on speed and openness with the public that the U.S. episcopate does. American bishops are closer to the schools and parishes where abuse actually takes place. When one leader fails to respond appropriately to abuse, they all take on the stench of corruption. And unlike the pope, local bishops generally are seen as dispensable by their followers\u2014shepherds to be discarded if they fail to protect the flock.\n\nDespite the imprudent delay, U.S. bishops can continue cleaning their own pastures ahead of the Rome summit. Active investigations into Archbishop McCarrick\u2019s rise in the four dioceses where he served will be a chance to expose coverups and shifting of responsibility in their ranks. Church leaders are discussing protocols to punish sexual misconduct between priests and seminarians, and many want to impose uniform punishments on bishops found guilty of misconduct. Such rules could have prevented Archbishop McCarrick\u2019s ascent through the church hierarchy.\n\nFinally, many bishops continue to urge closer scrutiny of gay subcultures within American dioceses and seminaries. \u201cTo ignore it would be fleeing from the truth,\u201d Archbishop Cordileone noted during a speech at the conference. He pointed to a Ruth Institute study released this month that found a connection between sex among priests and the abuse of minors.\n\nThroughout the Baltimore gathering, bishops referred to feedback they have received from Catholics whose patience already has run out. One such critic is Michael Norris, who as a boy in the 1970s was molested by a priest. \u201cWe\u2019ve been calling for grand juries for 30 years. We\u2019ve been calling for the federal government to get involved. We\u2019ve been calling for RICO,\u201d said Mr. Norris, a board member of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP. He said in an interview that his group hopes punishment for sex-abuse coverups in the church can be imposed from outside. And it might: The District of Columbia\u2019s attorney general hasn\u2019t ruled out a future challenge to the church\u2019s nonprofit status. Other state prosecutors could follow.\n\nThough Mr. Norris no longer practices his faith, and the Catholic League and other groups consider SNAP anti-Catholic, support for his hard-line approach could grow. Even the church\u2019s most ardent defenders might embrace government intervention if the public loses patience with the pace of reform. \u201cThere has been a general lowering of standards,\u201d Archbishop Cordileone admits of his peers. Yet he insists it has finally passed: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard how important it is to listen to our people.\u201d\n\nMr. Ukueberuwa is an assistant editorial features editor at the Journal."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Patrick Thomas", "title": "Post Holdings Plans IPO for Nutrition Unit", "description": "The transaction that involves PowerBar and Joint Juice brands is expected to be completed in the second half of fiscal year 2019.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/post-holdings-plans-ipo-for-nutrition-unit-1542325206", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37408/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:01:25Z", "content": "Post Holdings Inc.
