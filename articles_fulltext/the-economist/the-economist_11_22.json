Mr Trump promised that Mr Kim would gain all manner of riches if he agreed to give up his nuclear programme. Shortly afterwards, Mr Trump declared in a tweet that his deal with Mr Kim had solved the problem: there was \u201cno longer a Nuclear Threat\u201d from Mr Kim\u2019s regime.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that upbeat meeting was any guide, North Korea should long ago have made its first strides towards the nuke-free sunlit uplands that Mr Trump envisaged. But not much has happened. North Korea continues to expand its nuclear programme, in violation of several UN resolutions.\n\nAttempts to establish regular working-level talks to flesh out the agreement between Mr Trump and Mr Kim have led nowhere. The latest such meeting, scheduled for earlier this month between Mike Pompeo, America\u2019s secretary of state, and Kim Yong Chol, the North\u2019s nuclear negotiator, was cancelled by the North at the last minute. Rather than trying to turn his country into a beach paradise, Mr Kim seems determined to keep it a poverty-stricken, nuke-wielding \u201cpeople\u2019s paradise\u201d.\n\nWhat has gone wrong? America and North Korea disagree about how to interpret the vaguely worded Singapore deal. The text commits North Korea to working towards the \u201ccomplete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d in return for American security guarantees. It also requires the two countries to establish \u201cnew\u201d relations and build a \u201clasting and stable peace regime\u201d on the peninsula.\n\nAmerica says this means that North Korea must first give up its nuclear programme, or at least take irreversible steps towards this goal, before receiving anything substantial in return. North Korea says the priority is to establish normal relations. It claims that it has already made several important concessions to show its good will\u2014such as a freeze on nuclear testing that preceded the Singapore summit, its claimed dismantling of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site (which was about to close anyway) and the return of some bones of American soldiers who died in the Korean war of 1950-53. The North says it is now America\u2019s turn to match these gestures, ideally by lifting some sanctions.\n\nThe disagreement has been obvious since Mr Pompeo\u2019s first post-Singapore trip to Pyongyang in July, when North Korea rebuffed his attempts to discuss a timeline for dismantling nuclear facilities, or the possibility that the North might provide a list of them to America. The two Koreas, meanwhile, have continued their rapprochement, most notably at a symbolism-rich summit between Mr Kim and Moon Jae-in, the South\u2019s president, in Pyongyang in September. (In line with an accord reached on that occasion, the North has blown up some of its guard posts in the demilitarised zone that divides the two Koreas\u2014see picture). But America and North Korea have been stuck in a rut since June.\n\nThe lack of progress in the nuclear talks has begun to hinder the inter-Korean rapprochement, too. Mr Moon is unlikely to achieve his goal to declare an end to the Korean war before the year\u2019s end. And although South Korean peaceniks have staged flower-waving performances in the centre of Seoul to encourage Mr Kim to visit the city, no date for such a trip has been scheduled. Neither have the two sides agreed when they will implement their leaders\u2019 pledge to re-establish inter-Korean rail links. On November 20th Mr Pompeo warned South Korea not to race ahead to improve ties with the North. He said that the process should run in parallel with his own\u2019s country\u2019s efforts to do so.\n\nThe North is angry about this. Earlier this month, after America and South Korea said they would set up a group of officials to coordinate their North Korea policies, the North condemned American \u201cinterference\u201d in inter-Korean rapprochement. It threatened to return to nuclear- and missile-testing if America did not lift sanctions and help with a peace treaty. In a speech at the UN in September, Ri Yong Ho, the North\u2019s foreign minister, bemoaned America\u2019s \u201ccoercive methods, which are lethal to trust-building\u201d.\n\nAmerica may have hoped to \u201cbackfill\u201d the Singapore agreement in subsequent working-level talks, says Scott Snyder of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. But North Korea has shown little interest in doing so. It has constantly tried to sideline officials such as Mr Pompeo and John Bolton, Mr Trump\u2019s national security adviser, who have been much less upbeat about the North\u2019s intentions than Mr Trump himself. Stephen Biegun, who was appointed as America\u2019s special representative for North Korea in August, has yet to meet his North Korean counterpart. Even Mr Trump has begun to share the scepticism of his advisers.\n\nThere are rays of hope. When Mr Pompeo visited Pyongyang in October for the first time since July, he returned with an offer from North Korea to allow inspectors to visit Punggye-ri. Mr Kim has also offered to close down Yongbyon, one of its main nuclear facilities, in return for \u201ccorresponding measures\u201d by America (though many experts doubt that Yongbyon, a decades-old facility, still has much value for the North\u2014secret uranium-enrichment programmes are probably far more useful). On November 15th Mike Pence, America\u2019s vice-president, suggested that another summit between Mr Trump and Mr Kim could take place next year, even if the North does not produce a list of its nuclear facilities before then. This appeared to be a hint that America remains willing to try to find a way of breaking the impasse, even though it is unlikely to make big concessions up front.\n\nMr Trump, it is safe to assume, still wants to be seen as a master dealmaker. So he may decide to meet Mr Kim again and offer some symbolic gestures should Mr Kim agree to let in inspectors. That might enable the two sides to begin working on a more comprehensive deal. Time is not entirely on Mr Kim\u2019s side, given that Mr Trump\u2019s and Mr Moon\u2019s successors are unlikely to be as enthusiastic about engaging with his regime. If Mr Kim does not budge, America and its allies may respond by trying to secure a more rigorous enforcement of sanctions. But it may be difficult to persuade China, through which most of North Korea\u2019s external trade passes, to agree to that. The trade war between China and America is hardly conducive to co-operation. The risk of another nail-biting escalation of tension between America and North Korea is still high."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Superpower rivalry blows the APEC summit to smithereens", "description": "Mike Pence and Xi Jinping show how differently they see the world", "url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/11/24/superpower-rivalry-blows-the-apec-summit-to-smithereens", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_ASD000_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:12:34Z", "content": "N O ONE HAS ever before accused APEC of holding a drama-filled summit.

The scarcity of hotels and the violence of its \u201craskol\u201d gangs meant delegates and the press pack were lodged on cruise ships in the bay. At least the top deck afforded a view of the growing geopolitical battle for influence in the region. To seaward, the rigid inflatables of America\u2019s armed coastguard left a sense of security in their wake. On shore, the 23-storey Noble Centre was conspicuous. The Chinese state-owned company that built it called it the city\u2019s \u201cmodernest\u201d edifice. A hint of American might, and of China\u2019s love of concrete.\n\nIndeed, a $50m splurge financed by China produced a separate convention centre in time, plus a new road linking it to the airport. Banners along the way proclaimed the promise of the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ), a pet project of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. With a rare unpotholed road now at its disposal, APEC \u2019s poorest member flew in 40 Maserati saloons and three Bentley Flying Spurs for delegates\u2019 use.\n\nOn a cruise ship, Mr Xi insisted the BRI was not \u201can exclusive club closed to non-members\u201d, nor \u201ca trap, as some people have labelled it\u201d. Mike Pence, America\u2019s vice-president, begged to differ. He offered another idea: a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific\u201d, or FOIP , as Japanese supporters of the idea have taken to calling it. Drowning partners \u201cin a sea of debt\u201d was not America\u2019s approach, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t coerce or compromise your independence\u2026We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the vice-president mentioned \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d two-score times and \u201cAsia-Pacific\u201d not once. It was as if to emphasise the size of the canvas on which America was preparing to counter China\u2019s growing influence with economic engagement of its own. American-promised money, admittedly, remains puny in comparison with the amounts touted in connection with the BRI . The BUILD Act, passed by Congress in October, creates a new agency, the US International Development Finance Corporation, to foster private development and public accountability in poor countries. But the size of its commitment ($60bn) is small\u2014China has pledged more to one country, Pakistan. At least Papua New Guinea got a boost: America, Australia and Japan will join forces to provide electricity to 70% of the country\u2019s homes by 2030\u2014only 13% of them have electricity today.\n\nDevelopment is welcome, but APEC members wonder where superpower rivalry is heading. America also announced it was helping Australia expand a naval base on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus Island that the Americans first built during the second world war to counter Japan, then the region\u2019s aspiring hegemon. That has reassured those Australian strategists who worry that Papua New Guinea is slipping into China\u2019s orbit. But it has also miffed China.\n\nAbove all, countries fret about the deepening trade fight between China and America. At APEC Chinese officials, in a bout of tantrum diplomacy, stymied attempts to produce a joint statement. Their main objection was American-backed phrasing, presumably aimed at China, that called for members to fight protectionism and unfair trade practices. Chinese diplomats invaded the Papua New Guinean foreign minister\u2019s office to get the line taken out. When their filibuster of the final APEC session ended in the summit\u2019s failure, the Chinese delegation broke into applause.\n\nSuch boorishness\u2014which also included officials barring non-Chinese journalists from Mr Xi\u2019s meeting with Pacific-island leaders\u2014hardly helps China\u2019s cause. The region\u2019s smaller countries hate being caught between two squabbling superpowers. They are not all pleased by America\u2019s new hard, anti-China line. But they would hate it even more were America not present at all."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh refuse to go back to Myanmar", "description": "Myanmar has done nothing to convince them they will be safe", "url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/11/24/rohingya-refugees-in-bangladesh-refuse-to-go-back-to-myanmar", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_ASP002_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:12:34Z", "content": "F OR THE Rohingya refugees in camps in southern Bangladesh, it was a frightening moment.

A plan for voluntary repatriation stalled when not a single Rohingya volunteered. On November 18th Abul Kalam, Bangladesh\u2019s refugee commissioner, said the government was still committed to voluntary repatriation. But he also promised a reappraisal after Bangladesh\u2019s general election on December 30th.\n\nA Muslim minority in Myanmar, where they are brutally persecuted, the Rohingyas were last year driven out of Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh. Myanmar\u2019s army is accused of systematically burning Rohingya villages and torturing, raping and killing the inhabitants. A UN report calls it genocide.\n\nUnlike Rohingyas still in Bangladesh who arrived after earlier waves of repression in the 1970s and 1990s, the latest arrivals have not been given refugee status by Bangladesh\u2019s government. Instead it calls them \u201cforcibly displaced Myanmar nationals\u201d, which supposedly means something different. Building fixed structures in the camps is not allowed, as is anything else that might imply permanency.\n\nAt first Bangladeshis welcomed the Rohingyas, but public opinion has turned. Many feel that there are too many of them (around 900,000) to accommodate indefinitely. Hosting them costs Bangladesh at least $15m each year. Ahead of next month\u2019s election, the ruling Awami League is keen to show it is listening to popular concerns. Some speculate that the abortive repatriation operation was intended by the party as a vote-winning stunt.\n\nThe ominously named \u201cisland plan\u201d has gained popularity. The idea of settling Rohingyas on an island in the Bay of Bengal was first mooted years ago. But Bhasan Char is not an obvious island to choose: formed in the past 20 years, it is prone to flooding and vulnerable to cyclones. (Bangladeshis, including officials, retort that their compatriots, too, lack adequate flood defences and that their lives and property are often threatened by cyclones.)\n\nAid agencies and human-rights groups have other worries. The island has row upon row of housing and communal ponds for fishing. But it is not clear how the Rohingyas would make a living there, or how they would fit in. The island is too small for all of them to live on.\n\nRepatriation is even harder. The UN has warned there is no plan in place to ensure effective monitoring of how those who return are treated. Nor has the situation in Rakhine state changed much in the past year. Tens of thousands of Rohingyas in the state are still confined to detention centres. Myanmar\u2019s government still does not accept the Rohingyas as citizens. It has offered no guarantees of their safety.\n\nThe Rohingyas are understandably reluctant to return. Before the planned repatriation attempt, many of the 2,200 on a list approved by the Myanmar government fled their shelters and hid in other camps or the nearby forest. Aid agencies note that, ahead of the exercise, fewer refugees used their services, fearing that registering for these might cause their names to be added to repatriation lists."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "How one Indian city cracked the problem of urban spread", "description": "A hundred-year-old colonial law comes in handy", "url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/11/24/how-one-indian-city-cracked-the-problem-of-urban-spread", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_ASC901.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:12:34Z", "content": "A FEW MILES west of Ahmedabad, in the state of Gujarat, a smiling patriarch named Shivaji still farms the land around the small redbrick home where he was born.

Mr Shivaji has already sold about a quarter of his land to a speculator (he hid the money in a hole before India suddenly cancelled most banknotes two years ago, forcing him to come up with a better plan). Slicing through his farm is a wide, straight strip of grass on which the municipal government will eventually build a road. Under it, a sewer has already been installed.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhmedabad, which contains 6m people, is growing by about 2% a year, both in population and in size. In that sense, it is a typical Indian city. But whereas most Indian cities\u2014and indeed most of them in the emerging world\u2014sprawl haphazardly, Ahmedabad is spreading in an orderly way. Many farms close to the metropolis, like Mr Shivaji\u2019s, already contain the ghostly outline of a rectilinear road grid. This is gradually being filled with homes, offices and parks (see picture, which shows part of Ahmedabad\u2019s urban fringe and one edge of Lucknow, a city in Uttar Pradesh). In some ways Ahmedabad is more like 19th-century Barcelona or New York than a modern Indian city. It is also a model for the future.\n\nIt is hardly surprising that most Indian cities are so messy, says Bimal Patel, an architect and planner who is president of CEPT University in Ahmedabad. When European and American cities were swelling quickly, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, they were surrounded by large farms that could be turned into fully-formed suburbs. By contrast, most Indian farms are tiny. A builder who buys a plot of land on the outskirts of an Indian city usually has just enough space to squeeze in a few homes. He will throw them up without sparing a thought for where any major roads or other infrastructure might go. Slum developments do not even have underground sewers.\n\nAhmedabad does things differently. Two municipal authorities\u2014one for the central city, the other covering a much larger area around Ahmedabad\u2014identify large blocks of land to develop. On the fringes of the city, they usually claim about two-fifths of the land area for roads, schools, parks, social housing and so on. Rather than claiming land only from farmers who happen to be in the path of roads, though, the authorities take the same proportion from everyone in the block.\n\nThen, using a century-old town-planning law introduced by the British former rulers, Ahmedabad\u2019s officials reorganise all land holdings in the block so that they align with the new road grid. Field boundaries that once curved and twisted become straight. The authorities pay farmers for the land that they seize, and charge them for infrastructure improvements. Usually, the land jumps so much in value that everybody comes out well ahead.\n\nThis process can be fraught, and is not entirely clean. Pankaj Patel, the man who bought land from Mr Shivaji, lists some of the many things that go wrong. To begin with, he says, people whom he calls \u201cland grabbers\u201d hear that an area is slated for development and try to snaffle as much as they can\u2014sometimes by fibbing to the farmers by telling them that the government will seize their land and give them almost nothing. Everybody complains that their reorganised land parcels are less well situated than their neighbours\u2019. Some bribe officials to give them a better deal. Rich, powerful people who own country estates in the targeted districts find various ways to gum up the works.\n\nNot one of these problems is fatal, however. Whereas attempts to seize land under eminent-domain laws are frequently paralysed by protests, the town-planning schemes trundle along. Crucially, the development authorities can ban building along the paths of roads even while arguments rage over the new land parcels. The town-planning schemes have proved flexible. To acquire land for a 76km ring road, Ahmedabad created 47 schemes and built the road in just four years.\n\nThe result is a tidy city, which can become much larger before it begins to suffer from the usual diseconomies of scale. Usually, the fringes of developing-world cities are messier than the middles. But the Atlas of Urban Expansion, a project based in New York University, estimates that roads built in Ahmedabad after 2000 are 8.5m wide, on average, compared with 7.2m for roads built earlier. Roads also take up more of the land area in the newly developed suburbs. Because wide roads can carry more cars and buses, future suburbanites in Ahmedabad ought to be spared the awful traffic jams that frustrate large Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nHow to charm a farmer\n\nThe same system works elsewhere in Gujarat. The city of Bhuj, which was devastated by an earthquake in 2001, has been rebuilt using town-planning schemes. Town planning is being revived in the neighbouring state of Maharashtra (Gujarat and Maharashtra both used to belong to a huge state known as Bombay). Other states are interested, too.

Nigeria\u2019s security chiefs were delighted. However, they should hesitate before celebrating. His death is a hint that the jihadist group\u2014already known for kidnapping schoolgirls and turning children into human bombs\u2014is becoming bloodier still.\n\nFor all his grand vision, Nur was slightly more moderate than the longtime leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau (pictured), who rejoices in enslaving girls and \u201ckilling anyone God commands me to kill\u201d. Under Mr Shekau\u2019s command the group has bombed markets and mosques alike.\n\nNur, by contrast, suggested that Boko Haram should only attack military targets and that using children as human bombs might not be an act of unblemished piety. His motives may have been tactical. By not engaging in acts of needless cruelty, the jihadists would be more likely to win support, or at least acquiescence, in the remote areas of north-eastern Nigeria where they operate. But Nur also had a theological disagreement with Mr Shekau over who was a Muslim and who could be declared an infidel and therefore killed.\n\nMr Shekau thinks that everyone not loyal to him or fighting for his group is an infidel. Nur and Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the son of Boko Haram\u2019s late founder, thought this too broad a definition. In mid-2016 they split away and swore allegiance to the jihadists of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq (who also thought Mr Shekau too extreme).\n\nThey formed a new group: Islamic State West Africa Province ( ISWAP ) . Since then the two factions of Boko Haram have fought largely separate insurgencies. ISWAP , which became the dominant faction, has operated largely to the north of Maiduguri, the main city in the region: Boko Haram has kept to the south and east (see map). Now ISWAP \u2019s policy of sparing civilians has changed.\n\nThe circumstances of Nur\u2019s death are unclear. Some people say he was killed in a falling-out over ransom payments for the release of 110 schoolgirls kidnapped early this year in Dapchi. A likelier explanation is that he was killed by younger, more extreme members of ISWAP who disagreed with his slightly more moderate stance.\n\nThere is certainly evidence of growing brutality. A video released by ISWAP showed the murder of a kidnapped aid worker, Hauwa Mohammed Liman. She was bound, forced to kneel and shot. A colleague, Saifura Hussaini Ahmed Khorsa, was murdered in September, three weeks after Nur\u2019s death. ISWAP said the two Muslim women, a midwife and a nurse, deserved to die because they worked for the Red Cross, which it argued proved that they were apostates.\n\nThe growing influence of ultra-extremists, some of whom are thought to be French-speaking foreign fighters, has disrupted ISWAP\u2019 s chain of command. Mr Barnawi himself may also be in danger. Nur\u2019s death has caused \u201cfragmentation\u201d in the ranks, says a negotiator who was involved in trying to secure the release of the two murdered aid workers (and a third captive, from UNICEF , who may still be alive). \u201cIn the history of Boko Haram there has not been a period where they have killed female hostages in this fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now the fighters are in charge rather than the clerics.\u201d\n\nObservers worry that the likelihood of freeing other hostages, including 112 girls still missing after a mass kidnapping from a school in the town of Chibok in 2014, has diminished. \u201cI doubt many more are coming back,\u201d says another hostage negotiator.\n\nMeanwhile the government\u2019s struggle against both jihadist factions has suffered serious setbacks. Army outposts and operating bases have been overrun in recent months. Attacks have spread into neighbouring Nigerian states.\n\nSome fret that Nigeria\u2019s army may not be able to hold the ground it liberated in 2015, when Boko Haram controlled an area about the size of Belgium before being pushed out of most towns. Casualties among frontline troops have been high and morale is poor. More than 70 soldiers are facing court martial after a mutiny in Maiduguri in August, when they protested against being redeployed to an area that is a Boko Haram stronghold, near the border with Niger.\n\nSuch military setbacks cast a shadow over presidential elections scheduled for February. Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president and a former general, won power in 2015 partly by promising to be tougher on Boko Haram than his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, had been. Having claimed last year that the army had crushed Boko Haram in its \u201clast enclave\u201d, he may fail to convince voters that he can do better if given a second term.\n\nNext year will see the conflict enter its second decade. More than 20,000 people have been killed; 2.1m have been displaced. If Mr Buhari cannot defeat the jihadists, Nigerians are wondering who can."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "God wants Ethiopians to prosper", "description": "The prime minister and many of his closest allies follow a fast-growing strain of Christianity", "url": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/11/24/god-wants-ethiopians-to-prosper", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_MAP504.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:10:28Z", "content": "T HE REASON why we are poor is inside us, cries Nigusie Roba, his face sweating with emotion.

For centuries national identity was entwined with the conservative ritual and hierarchy of the continent\u2019s oldest church. But \u201cPentes\u201d, as both Pentecostals and more staid Protestants are known in Ethiopia, are on the march.\n\nEthiopia\u2019s new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, is a devout Pentecostal. So was his predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn. Lemma Megersa, the prime minister\u2019s closest ally and president of Oromia, Ethiopia\u2019s most populous region, is a board member of Assemblies of God, the church which hosted Nigusie in Addis Ababa in October. The rise of the Oromo wing of the ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front ( EPRDF ), has brought even more Pentes into the highest ranks of government. Most of the executive committee of Abiy\u2019s Oromo faction have been followers of Pastor Gemechis Desta, a Pentecostal preacher, even though Pentes are probably still outnumbered in Oromia by both Muslims and Orthodox Christians.\n\nIn the 1960s Pentes were less than 1% of the national population. Today they may be as much as a quarter, packed into cities and among the fast-growing rural populations in the south and west. Most of this growth has come at the expense of the Orthodox Church (see chart).\n\nBefore the EPRDF introduced freedom of religion in 1995 the Pentes were fiercely persecuted by the Orthodox establishment and its allies in government. When Abiy\u2019s church, Full Gospel Believers, tried to register in 1967, its application was rejected by the then emperor, Haile Selassie. Arrests and beatings followed, worsening under the communist regime known as the Derg. In 1979 some church members were publicly flogged as punishment for not chanting socialist slogans. Popular hostility was rife, too. When one of Nigusie\u2019s children died in infancy, some of his neighbours in southern Ethiopia dug up the grave and hung the corpse on a post as a warning to others.\n\nEven during those dark times Pentecostalism won converts. In much of Oromia it has also grown with the rise of Oromo nationalism, in part because sermons are conducted in the local language, Afan Oromo, rather than Ge\u2019ez, the ancient language of Orthodox liturgy (akin to Latin for Catholics). Most of the founders of the Oromo Liberation Front, a secessionist rebel group, were Pentes.\n\nToday the faith\u2019s modern image explains its rise better than politics. In the Assemblies of God chapel upbeat pop music welcomes Nigusie on stage. A new wave of charismatic pastors known as \u201cProphets\u201d attract huge crowds by telling followers that God will make them prosper. Suraphel Demissie, who grew up as an orphan, has a 24-hour satellite television channel, tens of millions of YouTube views, a large office in Addis Ababa and an international following. \u201cThe beguiling feature of Pentecostalism ...[is] the idea that nothing is impossible,\u201d says Andrew DeCort of the Ethiopian Graduate School of Theology.\n\nIdeas like these can be revolutionary. Dena Freeman, an anthropologist, found how a large majority of people in a rural district in Ethiopia\u2019s southern highlands converted to Pentecostalism in the early 2000s. The individualism taught by the religion encouraged a boom in businesses, in part because it freed people from traditional obligations to share their wealth."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Binyamin Netanyahu has overcome one challenge.

He also thinks he can dictate the timing of next year\u2019s election\u2014and win it. But the tactics he used to see off the challenge by Avigdor Lieberman, the leader of Yisrael Beiteinu and former defence minister, betray vulnerabilities.\n\nCiting intelligence that \u201csimply cannot be revealed at this point\u201d, Mr Netanyahu justified his defence policies and hinted at vague threats. He thus implored the remaining members of his government to stick with him. And so they did, even Naftali Bennett, the leader of the nationalist-religious Jewish Home Party, who had demanded the post of defence minister. Mr Bennett accused the prime minister of scaremongering and issued a scathing assessment of his policies. But in the end he succumbed to pressure from rabbis and settlers not to bring down the coalition, which now has a one-seat majority.\n\nMr Netanyahu has led one of the most hawkish and religious governments in Israel\u2019s history. In July he signed a law affirming Israel\u2019s Jewish nationalist identity, to the fury of Arab and Druze minorities. Even so, Israeli nationalists are sceptical of his commitment to their cause. He has not expanded settlements as much as they would like; nor has he hit Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, with enough force, in their opinion. Mr Lieberman cited a recent truce with Hamas as the reason for his challenge. Now, with the slimmest of majorities, Mr Netanyahu is at the mercy of his right-wing allies. If the conflict with Hamas escalates again, he will be under enormous pressure to go to war.\n\nBut Mr Netanyahu\u2019s next big challenge may come at home. The attorney-general is expected to bring charges of corruption against him early next year. There is no precedent for a prime minister serving while on trial; but there is no law requiring him to resign. Mr Netanyahu denies the allegations. He has said in private that he would fight the charges in court, while running the country\u2014a move that would undoubtedly be contested in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe legal process will take months. Israel must hold an election by November next year. Mr Netanyahu is in no rush, but he may eventually want to show that a majority of voters are behind him, regardless of his legal problems. Though his popularity has declined because of the truce, polls still show him in good shape. His party, Likud, would handily win a plurality were an election held today. Keeping his allies on board, now and after charges are filed, will be the tough part. His legal troubles give them even more leverage.\n\nThe nationalists, though, also depend on Mr Netanyahu. They appreciate his uncanny ability to win elections\u2014and fear the prospect of a centre-left government that might cede territory to the Palestinians, which the prime minister has not done. Few of his potential rivals have dared to challenge him. Many on the right still think Israel would be worse off without Mr Netanyahu\u2019s leadership."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Will smuggled files lead to justice for the Assad regime's victims?", "description": "Western prosecutors are using the documents to issue arrest warrants.

Those files are now being used by prosecutors in the West to link Syrian officials, including President Bashar al-Assad, to war crimes.\n\nThis month France said it had issued international arrest warrants for three Syrian officials, including Ali Mamlouk, Mr Assad\u2019s security adviser, and Jamil Hassan, the air force intelligence chief. These resulted from a case involving two French-Syrians who were arrested in Syria in 2013 and disappeared. Germany, which claims universal jurisdiction over war crimes, meaning it can prosecute offences committed abroad, has also issued a warrant for Mr Hassan, who is accused of ordering the torture and murder of detainees.\n\nBoth investigations relied on tens of thousands of pictures taken by a photographer, known as Caesar, working for the Syrian military police. He smuggled them out of his office on USB drives hidden in his shoes. The photos (one is pictured) show thousands of corpses of Syrian detainees, many bearing signs of torture and murder.\n\nCaesar worked with Syrian opposition groups. Other Syrians are working with the Commission for International Justice and Accountability ( CIJA ), an NGO set up by Bill Wiley, a Canadian war-crimes investigator. CIJA receives money from Western governments and has a secret headquarters in Europe, where it stores over 800,000 documents (including some that incriminate Syrian opposition groups). Its files are being used by the family of Marie Colvin, which is suing the Assad regime in America. They are said to show that Colvin, a journalist killed in Syria in 2012, was targeted by the regime.\n\nCIJA has built cases against dozens of officials. A UN body is slowly bringing smuggled documents and other evidence under one roof for use by prosecutors. But the pursuit of justice on a grand scale has been blocked by China and Russia, which have vetoed attempts by the UN Security Council to refer the Assad regime to the International Criminal Court. Even in countries that have issued warrants, trials are unlikely. Syrian officials would have to be foolish enough to travel to a country willing to arrest them.\n\nMore documents await collection, hidden in homes, caves and pits inside Syria. But with Mr Assad on the verge of winning the war, some countries are normalising relations with his regime. Mr Mamlouk visited Italy in January to meet officials. Despite all the evidence, Mr Assad and his henchmen may never face justice."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "An unfair election in Bahrain will not satisfy the Shia majority", "description": "As their political freedom shrinks, the lot of Shias grows worse", "url": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/11/24/an-unfair-election-in-bahrain-will-not-satisfy-the-shia-majority", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_MAP505.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:10:28Z", "content": "A SK OFFICIALS in Bahrain about their parliamentary election and they are eager to tout the numbers.

Then came 2011, when Bahrainis joined the wave of Arab spring protests, demanding political freedoms and greater equality from the Sunni monarchy. The government crushed the uprising with the help of troops from its Gulf neighbours. Nearly 50 people were killed.\n\nNow al-Wefaq is banned and its leader, Ali Salman, is in prison on trumped-up charges of spying for Qatar. A secular leftist group, Wa\u2019ad, was also dissolved. Former members of al-Wefaq and Wa\u2019ad are not permitted to stand for election. Sunni Islamist parties are still free to operate, but they hold few seats in parliament. International election monitors are banned.\n\nAs political freedom shrinks, inequality has been exacerbated by an economic crisis. Though the non-oil sector generates 80% of GDP , oil provides 70% of government revenue. When prices crashed earlier this decade Bahrain\u2019s fiscal deficit soared, hitting 18.4% of GDP in 2015. The government has since cut spending. Electricity and water subsidies were reduced for expats and wealthy Bahrainis. An early-retirement scheme, launched last month, aims to trim the public payroll. More than 9,000 workers have applied for it.\n\nThese measures have helped, though this year\u2019s deficit is still projected to be 8.9% of GDP . A new 5% value-added tax, due to be introduced in January, will raise more revenue. But it will also strain families already struggling to pay their bills. Wages are almost flat and the median monthly private-sector income, 416 dinars ($1,106), is 41% below its public-sector counterpart. The higher-paying government jobs tend to go to Sunnis. Shias are mostly excluded from the security forces.\n\nShias, who often live in poorer areas, also bear the brunt of Bahrain\u2019s housing shortage. One minister has proposed importing cheap prefabricated homes. But there is little money for that. Public debt has soared to 88% of GDP and foreign reserves, at $2.3bn, are barely enough to cover a month of imports. In October Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) had to step in with $10bn in aid.\n\nBut as they give, they also take away. Bahrain has thrived as a banking hub and a tourist trap for Saudis. Both Qatar and Saudi Arabia are now trying to build up their own financial centres (Dubai, in the UAE , already has one). The Saudi crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, has allowed movie theatres, concerts and other diversions in a bid to keep Saudi tourists (and their money) at home.\n\nBahrain\u2019s banks still employ 14,000 people, most of them nationals. Saudi Arabia\u2019s new nightlife cannot compete with that of Manama, where bars serve alcohol and the sexes mingle freely. But firms are nervous. Bahrain has long relied on its wealthier neighbours for business and charity. Now they are also competition.\n\nOne thing is certain. The people of Bahrain will have little say over how it deals with these economic challenges."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Some international regulators have been captured by producer interests", "description": "They should be reformed to put consumers first", "url": "https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/11/24/some-international-regulators-have-been-captured-by-producer-interests", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_LDC815_0.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:10:18Z", "content": "I T IS A lesson straight from undergraduate economics.

National regulators are increasingly independent of the firms they regulate. But international ones still have further to go\u2014and none further than the specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the International Maritime Organisation ( IMO ) for shipping, the International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) for airlines and the Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) for postal services. These bodies regulate the cross-border aspects of their industries, from safety and pollution to technical harmonisation between different countries. They are also clubs that protect producer interests.\n\nThose interests are upheld in several ways. The first is the distribution of voting rights between countries. At the IMO , for example, Panama and Liberia, with populations of just 4m and 4.8m respectively, can automatically get seats on its decision-making body as they have the world\u2019s biggest merchant fleets.\n\nThe second is the assignment of those voting rights by individual countries. Remarkably, many governments have handed voting rights to private-sector firms. At the UPU , for instance, Britain has assigned its vote to Royal Mail; Germany has done the same with Deutsche Post. These firms stand accused of using their votes to sustain low fees for the delivery of their post in foreign countries. The IMO is worse still. At least 17 countries have assigned their voting rights to flag registries operated by private firms, reckons Transparency International, an anti-corruption group; that adds up to about a tenth of delegates. At an IMO environmental-committee meeting last year, almost a third of countries were represented, at least in part, by business interests.\n\nThe third way in which producer interests are protected is through a spectacular lack of transparency. The agenda of the IMO \u2019s council this week in London is available only to those with a password. Journalists are forbidden to report what delegates say or how they vote. There are no rules on the suitability or conflict of interests of delegates. In 2014 St Lucia appointed a Saudi billionaire without previous shipping experience as its IMO representative; a court in London judged in 2016 that the appointment was obtained in order to gain diplomatic immunity against divorce proceedings. There are no limits on the amount of gifts that can be showered on representatives. Goodies put on top of desks at an IMO assembly meeting last year were so heavy that they broke 137 sets of headphones underneath.\n\nSuch swampiness matters. The IMO and the ICAO are responsible for limiting emissions from ships and planes, which were excluded from the Paris climate deal. Green groups say, for instance, that the ICAO \u2019s new \u201c CORSIA \u201d rules on carbon offsets could cause an increase in carbon emissions."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Why Donald Trump is wrong to ignore the murder of a Saudi journalist", "description": "America First is hurting America\u2019s interests in the Middle East", "url": "https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/11/24/why-donald-trump-is-wrong-to-ignore-the-murder-of-a-saudi-journalist", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_LDP001_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:10:18Z", "content": "F EW POLITICAL murders are as gruesome and well recorded as that of Jamal Khashoggi.

The only question is whether the crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, personally ordered the hit. President Donald Trump appears not to care. \u201cMaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d he announced in a remarkable statement on November 20th, adding that America would remain a \u201csteadfast partner\u201d of Saudi Arabia. He sees the kingdom as a useful ally against Iran and Islamist extremism, an oil supplier that can keep prices low and a splendidly huge buyer of American weapons. The distortions and many exclamation marks suggest that Mr Trump drafted the statement himself. It starts and ends with \u201cAmerica First!\u201d\n\nAt first blush, Mr Trump\u2019s position is strikingly candid. His transactional attitude to diplomacy with Saudi Arabia looks like the realpolitik of past American presidents in dealing with the Al Sauds, minus the cant about human rights. In reality, Mr Trump\u2019s glossing over the murder of a peaceful critic is an alarming departure for America. It helps to create a world that is more dangerous, not safer.\n\nPrevious presidents have sought to balance moral values and national interests. Mr Trump has given up almost all pretence at defending morality; his sanctions on 17 Saudi officials are designed to protect the crown prince, not punish him. Mr Trump has thus abandoned an important tool of American power\u2014its role as a model of democracy. In repeating the absurd Saudi claim that Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d, Mr Trump has given licence to autocrats everywhere to kill journalists and dissidents. He has also shown, once again, that he prefers the word of an autocrat to that of the CIA , which believes the crown prince is to blame for Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nEven in narrow geopolitical terms, Mr Trump is wrong. The crown prince is turning Saudi Arabia into a force for instability, and so is helping Iran extend its influence. His war in Yemen is unwinnable and causing widespread hunger and disease; it is hurting Saudi Arabia and its Western allies more than Iran. His feud with Qatar has pushed it closer to Iran. Even though it co-operates in the fight against jihadist groups, Saudi Arabia still feeds their ideology through textbooks that promote the view that Jews, Christians, Shia Muslims and others are infidels. What about oil and arms sales? Saudi Arabia wants to raise, not cut, the price of oil. And it has signed contracts for only $14.5bn of the $110bn-worth of arms purchases that Mr Trump likes to tout.\n\nThere are many reasons for the West to keep Saudi Arabia close. It is crucial to Islam and to regional stability. However, working with the Al Sauds should not mean doing whatever they ask. They need America more than it needs them. America should tell the Saudis to get out of the war in Yemen and make up with Qatar. Above all, it should tell them that rule by fear is no recipe for stability at home.\n\nIt does not take a CIA report to know that ultimate responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s murder lies with Muhammad bin Salman. His reputation as an economic and social reformer, who allowed cinemas to open and women to drive, has transmogrified into that of an old-fashioned Arab tyrant: insecure, brutal and rash.\n\nThere are few angels in Arab palaces. But Khashoggi\u2019s blood is a permanent stain on the crown prince. It is increasingly hard to imagine him being a stable and reliable monarch. The stories of disquiet among the Al Sauds are growing. King Salman would be wise to start sharing power more widely\u2014starting with the appointment of a new crown prince."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The case for scrapping stamp duty", "description": "Taxes on homebuyers are inefficient and unfair", "url": "https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/11/24/the-case-for-scrapping-stamp-duty", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_LDP002.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:10:18Z", "content": "I N RECENT YEARS many rich-world politicians have at last woken up to the blight of expensive housing.

Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, has promised a \u201crobust, comprehensive, life-changing\u201d impact on the housing market. Australia\u2019s new prime minister has fretted that youngsters are putting off parenthood while they save up for homes. Recognition is growing that rapid house-price inflation has caused intergenerational inequity, destabilised finance and constrained economic growth.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf only the rhetoric was matched by action. Dysfunctional government policies, which have coincided with lower real interest rates, have pushed prices up (see article). The fundamental mistake is excessive regulation of house-building in and around successful cities. But a second senseless distortion makes things worse: taxes on property transactions.\n\nSuch levies, or stamp duties as they are often called, are common. Many European countries have them, including France, Germany and Sweden, where house prices have grown particularly rapidly in recent years. All but 12 American states levy charges, typically around 1%, when property changes hands. Some countries are much more aggressive. In Australia the top rate of stamp duty reaches 7%; in Britain the figure is 12% for the most expensive properties. Even an average terraced house in London attracts tax of over \u00a315,000 ($19,000) every time its ownership changes, a year\u2019s earnings at the minimum wage.\n\nFirst-time buyers are often partially exempt from stamp duties. Yet that barely limits the damage. The problem is that a wedge between what buyers pay and what sellers receive slows the pace at which properties change hands. By one estimate for cheaper houses, a 1% increase in stamp duty reduces annual churn in property ownership by 3.5%. When fewer moves mean fewer job switches, the labour market becomes less efficient. Productivity growth may slow. Thankfully, transaction taxes tend to bite hardest only for expensive homes. But gumming up the top of the housing market has knock-on effects. Those who would occupy mansions stay in cheaper homes instead.\n\nThe taxes also discourage downsizing, a particularly unwelcome effect in ageing societies. More than two-fifths of British housing equity is owned by over-65s, many of whom are sitting on large, empty nests. More than a third of Britain\u2019s owner-occupied houses have two or more spare bedrooms. People are entitled to hold on to their houses if they wish. But the tax system should not encourage them to do so\u2014especially when high prices have left many families wanting more space.\n\nThere is an obvious replacement for transaction taxes: higher annual levies on property values or, ideally, on land values. Such taxes target wealth, and can be just as progressive as stamp duty, but they do not distort markets much. In a transition from one system to the other, the obvious losers would be those who do not intend to move in future: settled property owners, many of whom have enjoyed windfall gains as house prices have soared. True, some would be poorer old people, who could not afford an annual levy to stay in their homes. But the taxes could be deferred until their houses are sold upon their deaths.\n\nThis suggestion may sound like a long shot. That a tax as boneheaded as stamp duty can persist reveals the apparent emptiness of politicians\u2019 commitment to fix housing markets. Yet change is not impossible. The region containing Canberra, Australia\u2019s capital, has begun a 20-year process to phase out stamp duty and replace it with a residential land-value tax. Countries that still tax property transactions, especially those that do so swingeingly, cannot claim to be serious about reversing decades of housing-policy errors until they follow suit."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The difficulty of being Iv\u00e1n Duque", "description": "Beset with problems, Colombia\u2019s new president shows little sense of direction", "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/11/24/the-difficulty-of-being-ivan-duque", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_AMD001_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:09:45Z", "content": "F OR 35 YEARS Sandra Ram\u00edrez was a member of the FARC, Colombias largest guerrilla group.

His victory prompted fears abroad that the agreement with the FARC , which is backed by the UN , the United States and the European Union, was in jeopardy. In fact, the early signs are that Mr Duque\u2019s government is faithfully implementing the accord struck by his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos. \u201cIt is a government that understands that the peace process is by and large a necessity,\u201d says a foreign diplomat in Bogot\u00e1.\n\nOf the 13,000 or so guerrillas who demobilised last year, only 10% have dropped out, drifting into criminal outfits that plague parts of the country (including the ELN , another guerrilla group). Of the rest, some remain in camps and others have moved to cities. Mr Duque visited a camp on October 13th and assured its residents of his support provided they obey the law. His government this month approved funds for some 500 ex-guerrillas to set up co-ops.\n\nEmilio Archila, Mr Duque\u2019s head of post-conflict affairs, is trying to create a single implementable plan from the multitude of plans, agencies and acronyms left by Mr Santos\u2019s team for the parts of the country scarred by conflict. If there is less money for all this than promised by the Santos administration, that \u201cwill not be the result of a political decision\u201d, says Mr Archila. It will be because \u201cthe money that was programmed was merely dreamed.\u201d \u201cWe need to have patience,\u201d says Ms Lobo, who adds that the FARC leadership has \u201cno regrets\u201d over signing the peace deal.\n\nNevertheless, the new government faces broader problems, many inherited from Mr Santos but some of its own making. Mr Duque is a moderate technocrat. He has named a government in his own image. It has a lot on its plate and has run into political difficulties. Mr Duque\u2019s approval rating has slumped to just 27%, from 54% in September, according to a survey this month by Invamer, a pollster.\n\nFor a start, his government must cope with the arrival over the past two years of more than 1m Venezuelans, who are fleeing their country\u2019s chaos. Then there is the economy. To cut both the fiscal deficit, which is 3.5% of GDP , and the corporate-tax rate (from 33% to a still-high 30%), Mr Duque proposed to levy value-added tax ( VAT ) on previously exempt items such as staple foods, while compensating poorer Colombians. The difficulty is that he and the CD campaigned on a promise to cut taxes. Under pressure from the party he is backing away from extending VAT . \u201cIf we extend VAT the left will win everything [in next year\u2019s municipal elections] and Duque won\u2019t be able to govern,\u201d says Paloma Valencia, a CD senator.\n\nThen there is the issue of violence in the areas vacated by the FARC . These are mainly close to Colombia\u2019s borders, where cocaine production and illegal gold-mining are rife. The security forces should have occupied them. In practice they have not. That is one reason why the murder rate is ticking up after falling for many years: there were 9,360 murders in Colombia between January and October of this year, up from 8,754 in the same period last year. Those killed include village leaders and activists.\n\nThe army, still vital for internal security, is disgruntled by a special tribunal set up under the peace deal, which is supposed to judge war crimes by both the FARC and the security forces. The tribunal, some of whose judges are human-rights activists, \u201cisn\u2019t seen as legitimate by half the country\u201d, says Ms Valencia. She is negotiating in congress to add judges with experience of military matters. The government is leaving the politicians to sort this out. This adds to the tension between Mr Duque\u2019s team and its political base.\n\nThe new president has talked vaguely about wanting \u201cfairness, justice and enterprise\u201d. This gives Colombians only a vague idea of where he wants to take their country.

The five-month transition has left ample time for fretting about the prospects for the relationship between Mexico and the United States when a right-wing nationalist is in charge north of the border and a left-wing populist leads in the south. A lot is at stake. The border is nearly 2,000 miles (3,200km) long; 1m people cross it each day. Some 35m people of Mexican origin live in the United States. Vital economic ties depend on good neighbourliness, as does co-operation on sensitive topics from controlling immigration to combating drugs-trafficking.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for building a wall along the border and his talk of \u201crapists\u201d arriving from Mexico fire up his supporters at home but appal his neighbours. Nowhere has approval of the United States fallen as much as in Mexico. In 2016, at the end of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, 66% of Mexicans had a favourable view of the United States, according to the Pew Research Centre\u2019s polling; this has dropped to 32%. Just 6% of Mexicans have confidence in Mr Trump. In April, in reaction to the Trump administration\u2019s separation of migrant children from their families, the Mexican senate called for an end to co-operation on security and migration.\n\nThen Mexicans elected the country\u2019s most left-wing leader in decades. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador, who is often called AMLO , has a largely domestic agenda and little experience of, or apparent interest in, the United States. Diplomats on both sides reckon that relations between the two countries, already damaged by Mr Trump, could deteriorate further. How real are those worries?\n\nHistory casts a shadow over the way the two countries see one another. Mexico lost half its territory to the United States in a war in 1846-48. For the best part of a century the relationship was confrontational and distrustful. Relations improved during the second world war, when Mexico took the side of the Allied powers. But the countries remained \u201cdistant neighbours\u201d, as a book published in 1985 described them. They clashed over Central America, and in 1985 over the abduction, torture and murder in Mexico of an American undercover anti-drugs agent, Enrique Camarena, the hero in Netflix\u2019s latest series of \u201cNarcos\u201d.\n\nThen came a sharp shift. It started with market reforms in Mexico and negotiations from 1991 on a North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) with the United States and Canada. NAFTA came into effect in 1994. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the two countries began to co-operate more on security. \u201cAn understanding started to develop that there was a true strategic connection between Mexico and the United States,\u201d says Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington.\n\nThe M\u00e9rida Initiative of 2007 saw tackling drug-trafficking as a \u201cshared responsibility\u201d (a vivid example today is the trial in a Brooklyn courtroom of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n of the Sinaloa drug gang). The two countries worked increasingly closely on fighting organised crime, and on strengthening law-enforcement and justice institutions in Mexico. They now share passenger data on flights between them. Senior officials from the two administrations took to meeting every six months or so on a wide range of issues. Even military ties, unthinkable since 1848 and still sensitive in Mexico, started to develop. \u201cNever before in the history of these two countries had they worked together so closely in so many areas,\u201d says Anthony Wayne, a former American ambassador to Mexico.\n\nIt is this intensity of interaction that is now under threat. The first 18 months of the Trump presidency were a \u201creally dark period\u201d for relations, says one American critic. The regular high-level meetings of officials petered out, provocative rhetoric roared in. Now Mexico will have a nationalist in power, too. Yet there are reasons to believe that the close ties will prove resilient.\n\nFirst, the relationship between Mr Trump and Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has got off to a surprisingly positive start. They exchanged warm letters. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador stressed that both of them had fought the establishment and won. Mr Trump is said to refer to him privately as \u201cJuan Trump\u201d. \u201cAs long as they don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to become friends, they may get along well,\u201d says Andrew Selee, author of a recent book, \u201cVanishing Frontiers\u201d, on the forces driving Mexico and the United States closer together. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has been careful to avoid provoking Mr Trump. It helps that Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador was such a clear winner and that his party, Morena, secured majorities in both chambers of congress.\n\nMr Trump likes winners. In New York on September 27th, commenting on a new trade deal with Mexico, he did not mention the man who is still Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, but his elected successor: \u201cMexico was totally\u2014I mean, they were great,\u201d Mr Trump said. \u201cBy the way, the new president has been great.\u201d\n\nThat trade pact is a second reason to hope that relations between the neighbours are not about to enter a new dark age. As long as a threat hung over NAFTA , which Mr Trump called \u201cthe single worst trade deal ever approved\u201d, there was a chance of a rupture. But Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador was keen to get the issue out of the way before taking office. That an accord came first with Mexico\u2014before Canada\u2014was striking.\n\nThe relabelled United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ( USMCA ), due to be signed on November 30th, will need ratification by America\u2019s new Congress next year (not a foregone conclusion). For Mexico, some of its provisions bring constraints: a rule that 40-45% of final car assembly must be done by workers earning an average of at least $16 an hour may discourage investment in Mexico. But the USMCA is a lot better than no deal at all.\n\nIt will preserve a relationship that is more interdependent than many Americans realise. Trade has blossomed (see chart 1). For the United States, Mexico is the second-largest export market, behind only Canada. American exports to Mexico are worth more than sales to Brazil, Russia, India and China combined. About 80% of Mexico\u2019s exports go to the United States. Many of these goods contain American content heading back after processing. Intricate supply chains link the two countries. Under NAFTA , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) boomed: the stock of American investment in Mexico grew from $17bn in 1994 to $110bn in 2017. From a much lower base the stock of Mexican FDI in America rose more than eight-fold.\n\nTrade has helped Mexico modernise, with big implications for a third area of the relationship: migration. Illegal migrants crossing the border are no longer mainly Mexicans. In 2000, of the 1.6m migrants apprehended, 90% were Mexican. There were just 311,000 apprehensions in the year ending in September 2017; and well under half involved Mexicans (see chart 2).\n\nMore illegal migrants are now Central Americans who make their way through Mexico. The migrant \u201ccaravan\u201d that began in Honduras and headed slowly north towards the American border during the recent mid-term election campaign reflects this new reality. Mr Trump ostentatiously dispatched more than 5,000 troops to the border (though he notably avoided strong criticism of Mexico). On November 19th, after the caravan arrived in Tijuana, the United States briefly shut the busy San Ysidro border crossing in California.\n\nAmid the noise it is easy to miss the turnaround story of the past decade that \u201chas not at all been grasped by the general public\u201d, says Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service, now at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, DC . Not only have the migration numbers tumbled and the share of Mexicans among them dwindled. More Mexicans are now returning to Mexico than are coming to the United States illegally.\n\nThe reasons for this shift are a combination of deterrence (investments in border protection), demography (population growth, which spurred emigration from Mexico, has been slowing) and development (greater economic opportunity at home encourages Mexicans to stay, or return). Mexico\u2019s modernisation is also attracting migrants from its southern neighbours. So it is now at once a sending, transit and destination country. Whereas Mexico once criticised the United States for its harsh treatment of its nationals, it is learning what it means to be a magnet for migrants. It is upping enforcement efforts along its southern border, with the help of American money and technical support.\n\nThe next step could be a \u201csafe third-country agreement\u201d between the two countries, suggests Mrs Meissner. It would enable migrants who come via Mexico to be sent back for processing there. The Trump administration reportedly plans to force asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico during screening if they are not deemed to face persecution at home. That looks premature. Mexico needs more American help to build a robust asylum system and to keep migrants safe.\n\nThat is but one example of the sort of collaboration that will be needed if the two countries are to avoid a return to the more distant relationship of the past. \u201cThe seeds of both are there,\u201d says Mr Wayne: the good green shoots and the weeds that could take over if relations are not properly tended to. Things could go wrong in several ways.\n\nOne is a lack of bureaucratic bandwidth. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s incoming administration lacks experience in dealing with the United States (though he has picked a sensible foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard). His effusive letter to Mr Trump may have gone down well with the president, but it did not please some Democrats, whose support will be needed to get the USMCA through Congress. On the American side Mr Trump made his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, his point person on Mexico, but key diplomatic posts remain vacant. Roberta Jacobson, who resigned as ambassador to Mexico in May (and is yet to be replaced), recently described in the New York Times the \u201cdisarray\u201d of diplomacy under the Trump administration.\n\nAnother potential pitfall is that policies clash. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s decision to invite Venezuela\u2019s leftist dictator, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, to his inauguration points to one area of disagreement. The Mexican president-elect is focused on domestic policies, such as reducing crime, corruption and poverty. Even before taking office his populist decisions (cancelling Mexico City\u2019s partly built airport, for example) have created fears of unpredictable interventions, especially in oil. It is not hard to imagine other initiatives\u2014his party\u2019s push for the legalisation of recreational cannabis, say\u2014creating tensions with America.\n\nAnd there is the perennial risk from impetuous presidential rhetoric. So far Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has been pragmatic and restrained. But he promised during the campaign to stand up to Mr Trump, and in office there may be occasions when he feels compelled to respond in kind. If so, the danger is of a ratcheting-down of co-operation. For example, Mexico could be tempted to relax its security at its southern border, allowing more migrants through to head north, especially since Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador is sympathetic to their plight."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Jonathan Coe\u2019s new novel grapples with Brexit", "description": "In \u201cMiddle England\u201d he brings characters from his previous books into the fractious present", "url": "https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/11/24/jonathan-coes-new-novel-grapples-with-brexit", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_BKP508.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:09:17Z", "content": "Middle England.

Over the course of eight years Benjamin finds a new flame, winds up on the Man Booker prize longlist, and comes to realise where and with whom he would prefer to see out his days. For her part, Sophie makes a name for herself professionally, but rows with Ian, her husband, about Brexit; some misconstrued remarks to a student jeopardise her career.\n\nSecondary characters supply political bite.

Coriander takes part in the London riots of 2011; several characters pass comment on the opening ceremony of the Olympics of 2012, many more opine on Brexit.

Soon production will begin on a similar fleet for SEAT , a Spanish car company.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNinebot, which owns the factory, claims to have made over nine-tenths of the e-scooters now gliding through American cities. These scooters carry sleek designs with bright colours (green for Lime, orange for Spin, two other thriving firms) and minimalist four-letter names (Goat and Skip). But thanks to Ninebot, most also bear an older brand on their handlebars\u2014\u201cpowered by Segway\u201d.\n\nSet up in 1999, Segway invented the over-engineered self-balancing scooter of the same name. It languished under its initial owners (one of whom died after riding the two-wheeler off a cliff). But Segway has been rallying under the direction of Ninebot, which acquired it in April 2015 for an undisclosed sum\u2014shortly after Segway sued it for patent infringement.\n\nIt took Segway a decade to hit its initial 13-month target to sell 100,000 units of its original two-wheeler. In 2018, just three years into production, Segway-Ninebot will sell 1m scooters, up from sales of 600,000 last year. Ninebot\u2019s factory in Changzhou builds over 5,000 scooters a day. The firm\u2019s backers, which include Xiaomi, valued it at $1.5bn in its latest funding round.\n\nAt its headquarters in the tech hub of Zhongguancun in Beijing, scooters are propped up against desks and helmets are strewn about. Still, Gao Lufeng, its chief executive, says the booming scooter-sharing business is only \u201ca fraction\u201d of Ninebot\u2019s work. Its scooters account for one-fifth of its total revenue, almost all of which comes from its range of personal transporters, which include self-balancing unicycles (one is pictured) and e-skates, using Segway-Ninebot\u2019s balancing technology.\n\nMr Gao has especially high hopes for delivery businesses. In five years\u2019 time he wants unmanned delivery vehicles called Loomo, currently being trialled by its robotics arm with Meituan-Dianping, an online-services giant, to account for over half of Ninebot\u2019s total revenue. Using artificial intelligence Loomo can wheel goods from the gate of a compound into lifts then up to office doors, and, as costs come down, could take them straight to workers\u2019 desks, says Mr Gao.\n\nThe new venture gives a sense of Ninebot\u2019s ambition. It launched its first scooters within months of buying Segway, but the idea was older. Although Ninebot insists it developed its own self-balancing technology before the merger, Segway brought with it over 400 patents. Importantly, the acquisition let Ninebot drive its cheaper, sleeker products into an American market from which Segway had hoped to bar it. \u201cSegway is like Lamborghini,\u201d says Mr Gao, \u201cand Ninebot is like Volkswagen\u201d, the owner of the luxury carmaker.\n\nThe Segway brand has helped Ninebot expand beyond America, too. It expects competition in the scooter-rental business to heat up next year, as the likes of Bird and Lime battle with local contenders in Europe and elsewhere. Spin (bought this month by Ford for $100m) and Lime say they will design and build their own scooters, though Ninebot doubts they will match its production costs in the near future. Mr Gao thinks electric scooters may \u201cdisrupt even the old bicycle, because they appeal to our lazy nature\u201d. Ninebot, at least, will not be standing still."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Key-person risk is alive and kicking in global business", "description": "Carlos Ghosn\u2019s downfall points to a wider problem", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2018/11/24/key-person-risk-is-alive-and-kicking-in-global-business", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_WBD000_2.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:07:05Z", "content": "F EW CHIEF executives experience as hard a fall as Carlos Ghosn just has.

By November 20th he was in police custody in Japan, having been accused by Nissan of under-reporting his pay to regulators by around $45m over five years. At least Mr Ghosn can console himself with a different set of figures about how much he is worth. After the news broke the three car firms\u2019 combined market value dropped by $5bn, or 7%. Investors fret that he is the only mortal who can manage the complex alliance between the three companies. Mr Ghosn is at once disgraced and probably impossible to replace.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey-person risk occurs when an individual\u2019s presence, absence or behaviour disproportionately affects a firm\u2019s value. It might seem counter-intuitive amid the spread of artificial intelligence and a tendency for bosses to be more self-effacing, but this risk is rife. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance is just one of several examples this year. Shares of WPP , the world\u2019s largest advertising firm, have sunk by 27% since the acrimonious exit of Sir Martin Sorrell, its founder, in April. Tesla\u2019s shares fell by 14% on September 28th after regulators said Elon Musk, its boss and co-founder, had made misleading statements on Twitter.\n\nOf the world\u2019s 20 most valuable firms, Schumpeter reckons that eight have key-person risk, including Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase. Some 66% of firms in the S & P 500 would be materially harmed if their chief executive, or in some cases other key executives, were hit by a bus, according to the statements of risks that they file with American regulators each year.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t meant to be this way. In the 1960s and 1970s the corporate king was heading for extinction, replaced by bland executives like those in the film \u201cThe Graduate\u201d, who thought the key to life was \u201cone word\u2026plastics\u201d. In 1967 John Kenneth Galbraith, an economist, published \u201cThe New Industrial State\u201d, arguing that American industry was run by a faceless, benign technocracy. Modern finance theory emerged, seeing managers as functionaries who could be controlled using incentives.\n\nIn the 1980s the individual came roaring back. In \u201cWall Street\u201d, a film released in 1987, a fictional tycoon bends firms to his will. By 2000 the imperial chief executive, typified by Jack Welch at General Electric and Sandy Weill at Citigroup, was in his pomp. Then came crises at WorldCom and Enron, and later at Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, showing the danger of firms run by charismatic bosses. Governance gurus urged boards to limit executive power.\n\nAs a matter of etiquette, contemporary bosses are expected to rein in their swagger and talk up their team. Some, like Satya Nadella at Microsoft, even project vulnerability, not invincibility. Yet despite this, key-person risk has risen. The tech boom means that lists of the largest firms are full of founder-led companies\u2014six of the biggest 20 fall into this camp. The governance revolution only went so far\u2014only 28% of S & P 500 firms have independent chairmen. And after a decade of rising profits and share prices, CEO s are more entrenched. Last year outgoing bosses at S&P 500 firms had run things for an average of 11 years, up from seven in 2009.\n\nThe resulting key-person risk comes in three flavours. The hardest to swallow is when a flawed individual has near-absolute power owing to their control of a firm\u2019s voting rights. This is the predicament Facebook finds itself in after multiple scandals, with Mark Zuckerberg out of his depth but unwilling to appoint more effective subordinates or a credible board. With its share price down by 37% since July, investors may not be reassured by his suggestion on November 20th that he would be in office \u201cfor decades\u201d.\n\nA second flavour is when a firm is judged to be so complex that only one maestro can keep all the plates spinning. Mr Ghosn is an example. Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi are linked by cross-shareholdings and by an opaque, jointly owned venture that manages bulk purchases and co-ordinates collaboration, which he is chairman of. Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate that invests in telecoms and tech, has created a financial structure that is so indebted and complex that were he to leave suddenly, investors would panic even though Mr Son has given them poor returns for half a decade.\n\nThe most benign kind of key-person risk is when a boss is excellent at their job. At Apple Tim Cook has thrived at the nearly impossible task of succeeding Steve Jobs, while JPMorgan Chase is the world\u2019s best-performing big bank over the past decade in no small part thanks to its boss, Jamie Dimon. Yet even this kind of dependence can be uncomfortable\u2014how long will the magic last? Mr Dimon has gone to lengths to promote plausible successors such as Marianne Lake, the bank\u2019s finance chief. But he says he plans to remain at the helm until 2023, which would be a 17-year reign.\n\nLocked in\n\nSeveral lessons on dealing with key-person risk emerge. When firms have unequal voting rights, investors should demand a discount to buy their shares as compensation for the risk that the individual in control starts making bad decisions. Financial complexity is a trap, allowing managers to become hard to remove even when they are not performing well. And lastly, even the best-performing chief executives must be subject to an expiry date."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Facebook should heed the lessons of internet history", "description": "Its business model is threatened by lower usage and advertiser discontent", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2018/11/24/facebook-should-heed-the-lessons-of-internet-history", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_WBD001_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:07:05Z", "content": "B IG TOBACCO is what the bosses of several large technology firms have started calling Facebook in private and in public.

The social-networking giant, which runs Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger as well as its own core service, was thriving. But since January it has become mired in a series of controversies, misjudgments and missteps. It became clear that it had done too little to stop Russian interference in America\u2019s election in 2016. It had to admit that it had shared the personal data of 90m users with outside firms without permission. It later suffered a data breach affecting 50m users.\n\nThe past week has brought more bad news. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, has been forced onto the airwaves to defend his second-in-command, Sheryl Sandberg, after the New York Times on November 14th published a report alleging that they had tried to downplay the extent of Russian electoral interference to the firm\u2019s board of directors, and hired lobbyists and the kind of \u201copposition-research\u201d firms commonly used in political campaigns, to deflect blame onto other firms and to tarnish critics. The revelations have cemented the idea that Facebook is \u201cgrossly mismanaged\u201d, says an advertising executive. Its shares have fallen by 27% since the start of the year.\n\nThe comparison to Yahoo is imperfect. Even at its peak Yahoo never boasted a business as large and profitable as Facebook\u2019s. And the competitive landscape was different. One of the main reasons Yahoo declined is because it lost out to a powerful rival, Google, in online search; Marissa Mayer, its boss from 2012 until its sale to Verizon last year, was unable to restore advertisers\u2019 or employees\u2019 confidence as users left. Today there is no company that truly competes with Facebook\u2019s suite of apps, partly because it has hoovered up competitors such as Instagram, the wildly successful photo app that is at the centre of its future plans.\n\nBut people who watched Yahoo\u2019s collapse see ominous similarities. Executive turnover was a leading indicator of its decline; before Ms Mayer was hired it went through four chief executives in three years. Mr Zuckerberg, who controls the majority of Facebook\u2019s voting shares, is not leaving, but many top executives are. This year several have announced their departures, including Instagram\u2019s founders; the boss of Oculus, a virtual-reality acquisition; a co-founder of WhatsApp; and Facebook\u2019s general counsel and its chief security officer. \u201cThe number of senior people who have left publicly and denounced the company going out the door is unprecedented. This is Yahoo pre-Marissa Mayer,\u201d says a senior digital-advertising executive.\n\nIn another echo, the run of negative headlines is harming employee morale. \u201cHorrible\u201d is how one employee describes the atmosphere at Facebook on Blind, an app where people discuss work. That raises two risks. Star performers may leave to work at less controversial companies, and Facebook could end up paying dearly for mediocre employees to stay on (as its share price falls, it has to hand out more in stock-based compensation to keep people).\n\nHow might things play out? Facebook is still strong but it is precariously balanced at the top of the industry, facing several big challenges in the coming year. Above all, it must grapple with the changing ways that people use its products, which could have a huge impact on its profits. Adults over the age of 18 are spending 31% less time on Facebook\u2019s core social network compared with two years ago, which will translate into fewer opportunities to sell ads.\n\nA big part of Facebook\u2019s answer to this is Instagram, which executives see as a saviour. It is quickly ramping up the number of adverts users see there. Disagreements about how strongly to push advertising on Instagram are part of the reason that the photo app\u2019s founders unexpectedly departed in October. Now ads are around one-fifth of all posts that users see on Instagram, which is probably double what it was a year ago. This could irk people, who may choose to spend less time on Instagram in future, just as they have done with Facebook itself.\n\nAlready users are spending more time on products that do not offer the same opportunities for advertising. \u201cStories\u201d, the concept of posting sequential photos and videos of users\u2019 days and experiences that Snap, a messaging app, pioneered and Facebook copied, are popular both on Instagram and on Facebook. But there is less space for advertising within people\u2019s personal \u201cstories\u201d than there is on the conventional landing pages (called \u201cnewsfeeds\u201d) where people scroll through posts and ads are interspersed.\n\nMessaging apps such as WhatsApp are also growing in popularity but currently lose money. Facebook will inevitably roll out ads (which is again the reason why WhatsApp\u2019s co-founders left), but it knows that it needs to be cautious about introducing ads in an environment where people go for private communication.\n\nThis transition away from public consumption of content on social networks to more private interactions is a substantial vulnerability for Facebook\u2019s business. Mr Zuckerberg has acknowledged as much, comparing this transition to Facebook\u2019s earlier shift from desktop computers to mobile and predicting that making money from stories and messaging \u201cwill take some time, and our revenue growth may be slower\u201d. It is unproven whether these new products can ever be as lucrative as Facebook\u2019s core offerings.\n\nFacebook\u2019s political controversies have not yet dented advertisers\u2019 enthusiasm for its platforms but that may also change in the coming year. Many advertisers have long felt that Facebook is arrogant. Marketers with massive budgets are told to travel to its headquarters in Menlo Park, rather than staff volunteering to come to them, as is typical in the ad-sales world.\n\nSuch gripes aside, the marketing industry has two principal complaints. One is that Facebook is not working as well for them as it used to in terms of users engaging with their ads (even though it is raising its prices). The second is that it misleads its customers. Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research in New York, for example, has pointed out to the company that it was incorrectly promising advertisers that it could reach more 18-34-year-olds in America than actually exist there. Facebook has still not removed the claim, despite a class-action lawsuit against the firm for allegedly padding its audience numbers.\n\nA senior marketer for a large American bank says Facebook has made mistakes on measuring engagement, reach, views and other data for no fewer than 43 products. All of the mistakes, he notes, worked in the social-networking giant\u2019s favour. \u201cIf these were true errors, wouldn\u2019t you expect at least half to benefit marketers?\u201d he asks. He expects to reduce how much his firm spends on Facebook and predicts that other marketers will as well next year.\n\nAt the same time that advertisers\u2019 faith in Facebook has been shaken, politicians in Washington are running out of patience with the company. It seems unlikely that a new law will be introduced that significantly curbs Facebook\u2019s activities. But lawmakers\u2019 scrutiny of the firm is causing it to be more cautious about how it uses data for targeting advertisements and about what information it makes available to outsiders. That will further diminish its attractiveness in the eyes of marketers.\n\nMr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg are under pressure to prove to users and advertisers that Facebook is not only trustworthy but worthy of their time and money. If they cannot do so, and the company\u2019s share price continues its slide, it is possible that Ms Sandberg will be replaced in the next year. Mr Zuckerberg controls the majority of voting shares and is unlikely to go. He will doubtless have thoughts about Yahoo\u2019s sorry tale.

In a typical year the average American works 100 more hours than a Briton, 300 more than a French employee and 400 more hours than a German.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gap with Europe is partly explained by the number of days\u2019 holiday that Americans take each year. In 2017 the average American took 17.2 days of vacation. That was a slight rise on the 16 days recorded in 2014 but still below the 1978-2000 average of 20.3 days. Around half of all workers do not take their full allotment of days off, which averages around 23 days. In effect, many Americans spend part of the year working for nothing, donating the equivalent of $561 on average to their firms.\n\nIn the European Union workers are guaranteed by law a minimum of 20 paid days of holiday each year, with public holidays in addition to that (there is no mandatory minimum in America). The workers who can put their feet up for longest are those in Spain and Sweden, who get 36 days of holiday each.\n\nIt is true that Americans do well in terms of public holidays; they have ten, two more than workers in Britain. But that doesn\u2019t make them relaxing. In both 2015 and 2016 the Sunday after Thanksgiving was the busiest day of the year for air travel. After a cramped flight and a long wait in the security line, workers may end up feeling worse than if they had never left the office.\n\nAmericans also put in more hours per week. This was not always so. In 1870 the average European worker toiled for almost 66 hours a week, and those in America averaged 62. By 1929 there was little difference between the continents, with European hours at 47.8 and American ones at 48. By 2000 American males were well ahead, grinding out 43.3 hours against a European average of 39.2 (the female gap was smaller, at 37.2 to 36.1 hours).\n\nAt some point after the war Europeans decided to take more time off, while Americans opted (or were persuaded) to keep their shoulders to the wheel for longer. A survey by Project Time Off found that the main reason why Americans are reluctant to take all their vacation is fear of being replaceable. Other factors are heavy workloads and lack of cover from fellow employees. One useful feature of public holidays is that workers worry less about bunking off if everyone else does the same.\n\nForgoing holiday time does not always please the boss. A study by the Harvard Business Review in 2016 found that those who took 11 or more days off a year were almost twice as likely to get a raise or a bonus as those who took ten days off or fewer (although the causation could be the other way around; star workers may feel they can afford to take a break).\n\nNor do extra hours automatically lead to higher productivity. An analysis of figures from the OECD , a club of mostly rich countries, in 2013 found a negative correlation between GDP per hour and the number of hours worked across member countries. Again, the causation is unclear\u2014workers in richer nations may feel they can take more time off. But there is plenty of other evidence. A study of munitions workers in the first world war found that their output per hour tended to decline once they spent over 50 hours a week toiling. The Institute for Employment Studies in Britain reviewed academic research on the subject and concluded that \u201clong hours working [more than 48 hours a week] was associated with (but was not proved to cause) various negative effects, such as decreased productivity, poor performance, health problems, and lower employee motivation.\u201d\n\nThe danger is that long hours simply lead to wasted effort. C. Northcote Parkinson, a management theorist, wrote that \u201cwork expands to fill the time available\u201d. Every editor knows that many journalists only deliver their articles when the deadline is imminent. Workers may be staring at their computers, but how many have disappeared down the rabbit hole of Twitter spats?\n\nThe modern world is supposedly moving in a direction where routine tasks are automated, leaving the more creative processes to the humans. And humans are undoubtedly more creative when they are not feeling tired or jaded. So enjoy the break, American workers, and maybe take the next week off as well."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The FDA turns its attention to menthol cigarettes", "description": "Concerned about their appeal to children, the FDA wants to ban minty smokes", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2018/11/24/the-fda-turns-its-attention-to-menthol-cigarettes", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_WBP003_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:07:05Z", "content": "T HE FIGHT against smoking is, by his own admission, deeply personal for Scott Gottlieb, head of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), an American regulatory agency.

More surprising was a proposed ban on menthol cigarettes.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minty smokes represent 35% of the American tobacco market. In only a few other countries, such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand, are they as popular. Even as overall rates of smoking in America have been declining recently, consumers\u2019 preference for menthol cigarettes has increased slightly. The FDA laid out no time frame for its potential ban but its announcement sent big tobacco companies\u2019 share prices plummeting nonetheless. British American Tobacco ( BAT ), the second-largest non-state producer, was worst hit. It owns RJ Reynolds, which makes Newports, America\u2019s biggest-selling brand of menthols. Around 55% of Reynolds\u2019s sales in America are menthol cigarettes, according to Wells Fargo, a bank. BAT \u2019s shares have fallen by 20% since talk of a ban began. Canada\u2019s federal government banned the menthol variety last year.\n\nIn America mint-flavoured cigarettes are particularly popular with two groups: black smokers and young ones. Over 80% of African-American smokers puff on menthol cigarettes, according to national drugs surveys. That is a result of marketing by tobacco companies. Philip Morris, one of the biggest, commissioned research in 1953 that showed that although only 2% of white Americans preferred Kools, a brand of menthol smokes, 5% of black Americans did. This slight difference was then seized upon by advertisers and exploited. Elston Howard, a black baseball player, became a spokesman for Kools. \u201cPapa\u2019s got a brand new bag\u201d, a hit by James Brown, was used to advertise Newports in the late 1970s. Tobacco companies became sponsors of such events as the \u201cKool Jazz Festival\u201d.\n\nJust over half of all smokers aged between 12 and 17 also plump for menthols, compared with less than a third of those over 35. For young people, the appeal of such cigarettes is explained by menthol\u2019s capacity to mask the flavour of smoke and soothe the irritation that novice smokers often experience. As such, the FDA sees them as a dangerously appealing route into smoking. Previous research by the regulator have shown that although there is little evidence to show that menthol cigarettes are more or less toxic than any other kind, smokers appear to be more heavily addicted to them and less likely to give them up.\n\nThe agency\u2019s proposals will prompt a fierce pushback from the industry, reckons Dennis Henigan of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, DC . He expects that tobacco companies will challenge the argument that menthol cigarettes pose a distinct public-health risk. BAT argues that \u201cthe science today does not support treating them differently from other cigarettes\u201d. Tobacco companies may also argue that a ban will lead to a boom in illicit sales. The counter-argument is that it is far-fetched to think that any illegal trade would be so extensive as to undercut the public-health gains. Producing mentholated cigarettes illegally on such a scale without being detected would be hard.\n\nAnalysts, however, are sceptical that the ban will be enacted any time soon. The tobacco firms\u2019 arguments are convincing, many reckon. The scale of their legal challenge could prevent it. Such a move would go much further than previous efforts to deter Americans from smoking. Cigarette packets do carry written warnings about the dangers of smoking but a law from 2009 mandating graphic health warnings has not yet been implemented."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Harm reduction is the right way to treat drug abuse", "description": "Europe should re-embrace an approach it pioneered", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/11/24/harm-reduction-is-the-right-way-to-treat-drug-abuse", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_EUP001_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:57:36Z", "content": "T WENTY YEARS ago Lisbons Casal Ventoso neighbourhood was the biggest open-air drug market in Europe.

But since 2001, when Portugal decriminalised most drug use, the number of addicts has plummeted, and these days one has to know where to find them. One recent evening, three outreach workers from CRESCER , a charity that helps drug users, trudged up a hillside carrying bags of clean syringes, saline solution and pastries. In a grove of cane plants, half-a-dozen people were smoking crack or injecting heroin. A gaunt man leant over a friend\u2019s face, helping him plunge a needle into his neck.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarta Correia, a psychologist at CRESCER , is friendly with many of Casal Ventoso\u2019s drug users, but the thin fellow was unfamiliar. \u201cCall me John Doe,\u201d he joked, grinning. He had been shooting heroin for 25 years, since he was 15, he said. Ms Correia gave him a pastry and some syringes, accepting used ones in return. Other users got sheets of tinfoil for their pipes, and were encouraged to enter treatment.\n\nAt the height of the epidemic in the 1990s, authorities estimated that about 100,000 Portuguese, or 1% of the population, were heroin users. \u201cIt cut across all social classes. Nearly every family had someone,\u201d says Dr Jo\u00e3o Goul\u00e3o, head of SICAD , the agency that directs Portugal\u2019s addiction programmes. That generated the political will to take the fight against drugs out of the justice ministry and give it to the health ministry. Under the law of 2001, illegal drugs remain illegal and dealers are prosecuted. But possession for personal use is an administrative offence, not a criminal one. Anyone caught with a 10-day supply or less is ordered to visit the local Commission for Dissuasion of Drug Addiction. Rehabilitation programmes and opiate substitutes, such as methadone, are available to all users who want to quit.\n\nFirst, do no harm\n\nSince then, the number of problem heroin users has fallen to about 33,000. The government can claim only partial credit; drug epidemics tend to fizzle. But decriminalisation and treatment helped cut Portugal\u2019s overdose rate to one of the lowest in Europe. As for America, in 2016 it had 63,600 fatal overdoses. In Portugal there were 27.\n\nPortugal\u2019s policies are based on \u201charm reduction\u201d approaches pioneered in countries such as Switzerland in the 1980s. The idea is to emphasise treatment and prevention more than punishment, says Brendan Hughes of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ). Most European countries now have some form of harm-reduction policy, though the east is more conservative.\n\nSome countries take things further. Many have safe injection rooms, supervised by medical professionals who check the drugs for safety. In Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, addicts who repeatedly fail methadone programmes may even receive free, government-prescribed heroin. \u201cHeroin-assisted treatment\u201d has been shown to reduce crime and deaths. And it appears not to recruit new users: shooting up at a government facility under a nurse\u2019s gaze is hardly glamorous.\n\nBut lately Europe is facing different drugs. Cocaine use is up; in Barcelona, residues in wastewater suggest it more than doubled between 2011 and 2018. Most overdose deaths in the Netherlands are caused not by opiates but by party drugs like amphetamines or synthetic cannabinoids, or by ecstasy, which can cause dehydration. The drug GHB raises your libido, but can knock you out; it accounted for two-thirds of Dutch drug-related emergencies in 2016.\n\nFor stimulants like these, notes the EMCDDA \u2019s Andrew Cunningham, \u201cthere are no substitute treatments like methadone\u201d. The same goes for methamphetamines, rare in most of Europe but common in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. (They are still known there as \u201cPervitin\u201d, a brand of amphetamines distributed to Nazi soldiers.) In the past few years Czech meth has spread across Germany, mainly in paste form. The more dangerous crystal variant has popped up as well, often sold at T -shirt stands along the German border.\n\nResistance to decriminalisation can come from many sides. Moralistic Sweden has tough laws against even small quantities of drugs. That is one reason, critics say, why its overdose death rate is the second-highest in Europe after Estonia\u2019s: users are afraid to call for help. Poland has needle exchanges, but under its present conservative government, the number of syringes distributed mysteriously dropped by half in 2016. In Copenhagen last summer police repeatedly raided the anarchist community of Christiania, where cannabis dealing had long been unofficially tolerated.\n\nGetting tough on cannabis seems strange at a time when countries and American states are legalising it. Harm reduction began with cannabis in the 1970s, when the Dutch government began tolerating retail reefer sales in designated \u201ccoffee shops\u201d. But tellingly, it never decriminalised the business of supplying the coffee shops, so the wholesale trade stayed illegal. \u201cIt makes no sense at all,\u201d says Peter Schouten, a Dutch lawyer who hopes to become one of the country\u2019s first legitimate marijuana farmers when a pilot programme is launched next summer."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "A slowdown in Germany\u2019s economy", "description": "That means less cash for political dealmaking", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/11/24/a-slowdown-in-germanys-economy", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_EUP502.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:57:36Z", "content": "T RULY A GREAT achievementreal triumph!

But beyond the protection they provide, surpluses help oil the rusting wheels of Germany\u2019s coalition politics. Mr Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic Party ( SPD ), sinking in the opinion polls, is unhappy about its junior role in Germany\u2019s government. But it was surprisingly constructive during budget talks. The coalition deal it signed last year with Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) contains a long wishlist of spending priorities. In exchange for such prizes as a system of pension guarantees until 2025, the SPD even overcame its traditional resistance to spending more on defence.\n\nBut what happens when the good times end? Germany\u2019s economy contracted by 0.2% in the third quarter of this year. That was largely because new emissions standards for carmakers temporarily slowed production; most analysts expect a robust rebound in the last quarter. Yet amid the uncertainties of Donald Trump\u2019s protectionism, Italy\u2019s rogue government and Brexit, forecasts for German growth next year are steadily being cut to something closer to 1.5%. That would hardly mean a fiscal crunch, but it will limit the finance ministry\u2019s ability to hand out sweeteners.\n\nMeanwhile, the contest to succeed Mrs Merkel as head of the CDU , which comes to a head in early December, could cause wider political ruptures, including the collapse of the current coalition. Talks on forming a new government will be harder with less cash to splash around.\n\nThe role of windfall revenues in keeping government going should not be exaggerated, says Jeromin Zettelmeyer, a former official in Germany\u2019s economy ministry now based at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, DC . For years, governments have feared that Germany\u2019s boom may be nearing its end. They have moderated their promises accordingly.\n\nThe problem with Germany\u2019s success, notes Mr Zettelmeyer, is that it has allowed governments to avoid tackling structural inefficiencies. Germany\u2019s recent boom has been in part the product of good luck, says Christian Odendahl at the Centre for European Reform: strong global demand for its exports, a weak euro and low interest rates. But it has not exploited the opportunity to introduce more competition to its protected service sector, improve its woeful record on digitisation or reform taxes, let alone rebalance its economy away from exports.

Throughout a period that has seen mass protests, grinding recession and international tensions, Mr Sobyanin has provided steady stewardship to a city that accounts for nearly one-tenth of Russia\u2019s population and roughly one-fifth of its GDP . Since his appointment in 2010, he has also overseen the most sweeping transformation of the capital since the Stalin era. Armed with a budget that brings in some 20% of all regional revenues, he has refurbished scores of parks, repaved hundreds of streets, built dozens of metro stations and erected a new light-rail line. Public services have leapt into the digital era. Europe\u2019s largest city has become one of its fastest changing. Yuri Saprykin, a cultural commentator, argues that Mr Sobyanin will go down as a figure like Baron Haussman, who oversaw the renovation of Paris under Napoleon III.\n\nThat transformation has cemented Mr Sobyanin\u2019s status in Mr Putin\u2019s court. As Andrei Kolyadin, former head of the Kremlin\u2019s regional politics department, puts it: \u201cHe is one of the Kremlin towers.\u201d While serving as Mr Putin\u2019s chief of staff in 2005-2008, Mr Sobyanin was mentioned as a possible successor. His handling of Moscow has put him on the shortlist for prime minister, were Mr Putin ever to jettison his longtime sidekick, Dmitri Medvedev.\n\nIn Russia\u2019s hyper-centralised system, Moscow plays an outsized role, even for a capital, serving simultaneously as the centre of government, finance, media and culture. The city reaps revenues from big national companies and well-paid employees based there, generating an imbalance that breeds resentment from other regions. The World Bank reckons that, while Moscow has a GDP per person around that of the Netherlands, Russia\u2019s poorest region languishes closer to that of Honduras.\n\nThe previous mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, had ruled Moscow as a medieval fief since 1992, developing a reputation for corruption and crass taste. Historic buildings came crashing down, glitzy shopping malls popped up and traffic ground to a halt; in the meantime, his wife, a construction magnate, became the country\u2019s richest woman. Mr Sobyanin set out to break with the Luzhkov era. He told potential hires that he wanted to \u201cbuild a new Moscow with new people,\u201d recalls a former senior city official.\n\nThe new mayor focused on urban planning and public space. If earlier eras saw cities fight \u201cfor territory\u201d or \u201cfor factories\u201d, Mr Sobyanin has said, today they must fight \u201cfor people\u201d. Residents can now cruise wide pavements, on city-sponsored bikes and scooter-sharing programmes. Less visible, though no less important, has been the modernisation of government services. \u201cOne-window\u201d hubs have streamlined bureaucratic processes that used to require trips to separate offices.\n\nCritics charge that the changes have been cosmetic. New streets have come at the cost of lower social spending. Mr Sobyanin\u2019s demolition of small street kiosks, and hasty plans to raze ageing housing stock and resettle residents, betrayed a troubling disregard for private property. Improvements in quality of life have come with tighter limits on political freedom. In this year\u2019s mayoral election, Mr Sobyanin ran virtually unopposed; Alexei Navalny, Russia\u2019s leading opposition politician, who nearly forced a run-off against Mr Sobyanin in the 2013 election, spent election day behind bars. \u201cSure we have bike paths, but people get beaten with truncheons on them,\u201d says Lyubov Sobol of Mr Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation.\n\nStill, much of Moscow\u2019s liberal intelligentsia, often highly critical of Mr Putin, has come to acknowledge Mr Sobyanin\u2019s work at the city level. As Alexei Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the Echo of Moscow radio station, says, \u201cThrough gritted teeth, people admit that things were worse and became better.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The power of fish", "description": "What the poisonous politics of les poissons means for Brexit", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/11/24/the-power-of-fish", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_EUD000_1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:57:36Z", "content": "O N DECEMBER 11TH 1975 an Icelandic coastguard vessel came across a group of British ships sheltering from a storm in a fjord and ordered them to leave.

And all because of fish. The incident, more evocative of 18th-century gunboat diplomacy than modern relations between liberal democracies, played out at the height of the \u201ccod wars\u201d over fishing rights. Rival trawlers frequently rammed each other. The conflict even affected the cold war: Britain felt itself obliged to divert naval ships from patrols of the North Atlantic to guard North Sea trawlers. Iceland ultimately got its way by threatening to leave NATO .\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European fishing industry is a minnow. In the EU it contributes about 0.1% of GDP . Even in the regions most reliant on fishing (Scotland\u2019s highlands and islands, Spain\u2019s Galicia, Greece\u2019s Ionian islands) the proportion is little more than 2%. Yet the industry exerts an outsized pull on the continent\u2019s politics, affecting even giant geopolitical matters. The latest example is Brexit. At a summit on November 25th leaders from the 27 remaining member states will discuss and, it is expected, approve the withdrawal agreement drafted by the British government and the European Commission, as well as a political declaration on the future relationship between Britain and the EU . One of the main bones of contention will be fish.\n\nEuropean fishing policies helped motivate the Leave vote: Brexiteers demanded the freedom to exclude foreign trawlers from British waters, where they catch eight times as many fish as Britons do in foreign waters. A flotilla of fishing boats on the Thames in June 2016 was one of the campaign\u2019s most memorable events. One EU diplomat was struck, on the morning after the vote, to be called first not by his country\u2019s foreign or finance minister but by its fisheries minister. In Brexit, fish matter.\n\nBritish and EU negotiators had to leave the subject out of the withdrawal agreement. It is now due to be resolved by summer 2020, ahead of the end of the post-Brexit transition period. That incensed Brexiteers and Remainers alike. Last week Conservative MP s from pro-Remain Scotland wrote to Theresa May objecting to any settlement short of \u201cfull sovereignty over our waters\u201d. But governments of other coastal states, including France, Belgium and Portugal, want assurances that their trawlers will retain access to British waters. France wants a future trade deal to depend on such a guarantee. The common ground is narrow, so negotiators have to find a vague form of words to keep the deal alive. And all that for some 6,000 fishing jobs on the continent and a sector that contributes about as much to the British economy as logging or the manufacture of leather goods.\n\nWhat makes fishing so politically sensitive? Unlike widgets, say, fish are a limited, ecologically sensitive resource. They also migrate between competing national jurisdictions, and their movements are growing more complicated as global warming drives shoals in the North and Atlantic seas northward. Divvying up rights and quotas is tricky. Resentments emerge easily and die hard. Bad blood between Spanish and Irish fishermen, for example, has lingered for decades. The Irish navy once sank a Spanish vessel. Such disputes have often ended up at the European Court of Justice, generating some of the case law underpinning fundamental EU principles like non-discrimination between member states, the primacy of European law and clear dividing lines between EU and national competences.\n\nAnother factor that makes fishing touchy is that it is intensely geographically concentrated. In some European ports it generates more than 30% of local output and more than 50% of jobs; more if associated activities like transport, shipbuilding and fishmongering are included. If the industry suffers, the effects are starkly visible. Some of the poorest parts of north-west Europe are fishing towns whose trade has withered. Grimsby, on England\u2019s east coast, is so down-at-heel that Sacha Baron Cohen set a film there. Concentrated deprivation creates political pressure.\n\nA bigger scale\n\nFishermen have the tools and sense of common purpose to make their grievances heard. Boats can be used to ram rival boats\u2014a method that featured heavily in the \u201cscallop wars\u201d earlier this year, as French fishermen tried to prevent Cornish competitors from circumventing local ecological restrictions. Boats can also be used to create wider disruption. In January it took just a dozen trawlers to shut down the port of Calais, in protest at the Dutch use of electric pulses to release fish from the seabed. Irish, French and Spanish fishermen have all used such blockades over the years to extract government support on fuel costs. The industry is just as pushy in Brussels. Last year the Corporate Europe Observatory revealed that a number of fish lobbyists had used press passes to enter the EU Council building during ministerial deliberations about fishing quotas.\n\nIn the corridors of Brussels a simpler explanation is the most cited: \u201cPeople just like fishermen,\u201d says one insider. Europeans feel an almost Proustian connection to their food and landscapes that does not readily express itself when the widget industry is in trouble. To voters and politicians in coastal states, fishing ports are part of the national identity; they feature regularly in children\u2019s books. And jeopardised fishermen suggest jeopardised bouillabaisse or matjes. Such emotional considerations may yet force the hand of Brexit negotiators, notes Rem Korteweg of the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think-tank. Without agreement by 2020, Britain\u2019s fish exports (some two-thirds of its catch) will dry up, devastating fishing ports. As on so much else, the Brexiteers may not have thought this one through."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "A heroic sailor faces expulsion from Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement", "description": "Captain Gregorio De Falco shows the cracks within the ruling coalition", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/11/24/a-heroic-sailor-faces-expulsion-from-italys-five-star-movement", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_EUP501.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:57:36Z", "content": "S ELDOM HAS the morale of Italians fallen as low as in 2012 when the Costa Concordia, a cruise ship, was wrecked near the Tuscan coast and abandoned by its Italian captain.

According to Daniel Campbell, the boss of Effective Space, the British and Israeli firm which is building them, that is the way to think of the robotic spacecraft his company plans to start launching in 2020. The purpose of Effective Space\u2019s devices, which it calls SPACE DRONE s, is to prolong the lives of communications satellites (com-sats) that would otherwise be decommissioned for lack of fuel for station-keeping\u2014in other words, for maintaining their proper orbits.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, about two dozen big geosynchronous com-sats (those with orbits exactly 24 hours long, which thus hover continuously over the same spot on Earth) are retired each year, most commonly because of fuel exhaustion. Mr Campbell proposes to do something about that. In partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries, a government-owned firm, he plans to build the first two SPACE DRONE s in Tel Aviv, for launch in 2020. Once itself in geosynchronous orbit, at an altitude of 36,000km, each drone will slowly approach and clamp onto such an exhausted com-sat, giving it a new set of thrusters with which to manoeuvre\u2014and thus, since the thrusters should last 15 years, a new lease of life. If this works, dozens more drones should follow. According to Mr Campbell, Effective Space already has one contract, worth $100m, for such repositioning work.\n\nNor is Effective Space alone in its endeavours. Next year SpaceLogistics, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, an American engineering giant, will launch its first such \u201cmission extension\u201d spacecraft. MEV -1, as it is named, will handle station-keeping for Intelsat-901, a big com-sat that is currently low on fuel. SpaceLogistics reckons its docking system can clamp onto 80% of today\u2019s geosynchronous satellites. And NASA , America\u2019s space agency, is planning something similar for launch in 2020. This has two robotic arms and is intended to refuel Landsat-7, an Earth-observation satellite that was launched in 1999.\n\nThese projects are no small undertakings. But even more sophisticated ideas are in the pipeline. For an inkling, consider a programme called Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites ( RSGS ) that is being run by DARPA , a research arm of America\u2019s defence department.\n\nIn April 2021 DARPA plans, in collaboration with Space Systems Loral ( SSL ), a firm in Silicon Valley, to launch an RSGS spacecraft that has two dexterous robotic arms and thrusters sensitive enough to accelerate or slow orbital velocities by as little as a centimetre per second. Over a lifetime of 15 years or so this craft could inspect and service as many as 30 satellites. Besides refuelling them, it could do such things as plugging in electronics upgrades, extending jammed telescopic antennae and unfolding arrays of solar panels that had not deployed properly.\n\nThat last fix would, for example, solve a predicament that has halved the transmission capacity of Estrela do Sul-2, a geosynchronous satellite built by SSL that has been in orbit since 2011. Moreover, according to Richard White, the firm\u2019s government-liaison officer, if a close-up inspection reveals the need for a tool not carried on the servicing spacecraft, it could be sent up via a small-payload \u201corbital delivery system\u201d which SSL successfully tested for the first time this year.\n\nAdvances in space robotics have also led to efforts to develop kit that might be used to capture pieces of defunct spacecraft zipping around Earth. Such junk is abundant in low orbits (those with an altitude of less than 2,000km), and is threatening not only because of the damage it can do to individual satellites, but also because such collisions themselves beget debris, creating the risk of a chain reaction of impacts.\n\nIn 2016 China launched a small spacecraft named Aolong (\u201cRoaming Dragon\u201d), reportedly to test a robotic arm designed to capture debris. Chinese officials have suggested that more such vehicles are in the pipeline. Earlier this year, a European consortium also launched a spacecraft designed to test ways of capturing junk. Remove DEBRIS , as it is called, fired a net on September 16th and successfully caught an object it had released to simulate space junk. This was a world first. In February it will attempt another, by firing a harpoon designed to skewer a chunk of composite material brought along for the test.\n\nDark stars\n\nThese advances in what engineers call \u201crendezvous and proximity operations\u201d have elated many. But they have a dark side. Something that can grab or dock with objects in space might also be used to destroy them. As William Shelton, a former head of the American air force\u2019s space command, puts it, the difference between a service spacecraft and a weapon is merely \u201ca change of intent\u201d. According to Mr Shelton, in the past decade China and Russia have made \u201cstunning\u201d progress with such systems. At least one Chinese satellite has bumped into another one, perhaps in a test of the feasibility of such attacks.\n\nAttack by service spacecraft is certainly not the only threat to orbiting satellites. Cyber-invasion of their software is an obvious way to try to neutralise them. They might also be blasted by powerful lasers. And they can surely be knocked out by interceptors launched from the ground. But such \u201ckinetic\u201d attacks generate debris, as a test conducted by China in 2007 showed. Since that debris would threaten other satellites indiscriminately, it would put the attacker\u2019s assets at risk as well as those of its opponent. A service-spacecraft attack could avoid that by emptying a rival\u2019s satellite of fuel, severing its antennae or spray-painting its lenses and solar panels.\n\nAt least five Russian spacecraft, called \u201cspace-apparatus inspectors\u201d by the country\u2019s defence ministry, have already conducted rendezvous and proximity operations in both geosynchronous orbits and orbits close to Earth. Speaking in September, France\u2019s defence minister, Florence Parly, pointed to the troublingly close approach of a Russian military spacecraft named Olimp- K to a French and Italian military satellite as evidence that satellites \u201care becoming prey, targets\u201d. France recently decided to equip its future Syracuse military satellites with surveillance systems that will monitor approaching spacecraft.\n\nOther countries, too, are adapting to the threat. President Donald Trump\u2019s space strategy, unveiled in March, states specifically that America will \u201ccounter threats\u201d to its assets in space. American satellites are now being fitted with special thrusters designed for evasive manoeuvres, says Omar Lamrani, a military analyst at Stratfor, a geopolitical consultancy in Austin, Texas. Spacefaring states, America included, are dividing their assets between larger numbers of smaller satellites and also building more redundancy into their systems. Erwin Duhamel, who was until earlier this month head of security strategy at the European Space Agency ( ESA ), observes that officials in several places are now studying the idea of defending important satellites with \u201cbodyguard\u201d spacecraft. Mr Duhamel reckons ten or so satellites crucial to Europe\u2019s security are in particular need of such protection.\n\nHow such sentinels should defend their charges is debated. They might block the approach of an attacking satellite, or serve as a shield against a laser strike. They could also be armed themselves, with lasers or small \u201ckinetic kill\u201d missiles\u2014basically, sophisticated bullets. Fighting fire with fire in this way does run into the orbital-shrapnel problem, but according to Roy Lindelauf, an expert on satellite protection at the Dutch defence ministry, there is a way around that, at least for attacks on satellites in orbit close to Earth. Blast a hostile spacecraft from above, he says, and the wreckage will be forced downward to fiery doom in the atmosphere below.\n\nFor itself, ESA plans to launch, in 2023, a mission dubbed e.Deorbit. This craft\u2019s first job will be to push into the atmosphere a derelict Earth-observation satellite called Envisat. ESA has yet to settle on the best way for e.Deorbit to capture such a \u201cnon-co-operative\u201d object (Envisat weighs nearly eight tonnes, and is tumbling as it travels), but reckons that grabbing it with robotic arms or catching it in a tethered net are the most likely options. Either would be a classic piece of dual-use technology that could also be deployed to \u201cneutralise\u201d an inconvenient military satellite belonging to a hostile power.\n\nAmerica may be planning something yet more effective\u2014capturing enemy satellites for inspection rather than destroying them. Two unmanned American air force space planes, OTV -1 and OTV -2, have spent years in and out of orbit since 2010. The programme is classified but a former adviser to Barack Obama, who prefers to remain nameless, says the space planes\u2019 cargo bays could be used to remove seized satellites from orbit.\n\nOne consequence of all these developments is that a proposed ban on weapons in space that has long been pushed by Russia and China makes no sense, says Brian Chow, a space-policy expert who recently retired from Rand, a Californian think-tank. Potential weapons are already arriving in space, even if they are not officially labelled as such. A better approach, Mr Chow says, would be to prohibit unauthorised approaches, by declaring sensitive satellites to be surrounded by appropriately sized \u201cno go\u201d bubbles.\n\nSome people reckon this would be illegal. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, of which America is a signatory nation, states that space is not subject to national appropriation. But, half a century on, that treaty may be in need of revision."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The latest Mars-bound craft arrives in a few days\u2019 time", "description": "It will probe the planet\u2019s interior", "url": "https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/11/24/the-latest-mars-bound-craft-arrives-in-a-few-days-time", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_STP001_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:56:06Z", "content": "A LL BEING well, November 26th will see the touchdown of the latest mission to Mars.

This will permit wobbles in Mars\u2019s axis of rotation to be measured, which will help determine the state of Mars\u2019s iron core. A liquid core will cause bigger wobbles than a solid one.\n\nThe InSight mission will also test two other devices, but these will remain in space.

They are fitted out as radio relay stations, and will pick up signals from InSight and transmit them to Earth.\n\nThis is just a test. InSight has other channels of communication with Earth, and in any case the two CubeSats are fly-by craft that will quickly disappear off into the deeper solar system and be lost. But if they work, they will add to the ammunition of those who think the future of space exploration may involve lots of small, cheap craft, as well as big, expensive ones like InSight."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Going to university does not broaden the mind", "description": "But going straight from school to work narrows it", "url": "https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/11/24/going-to-university-does-not-broaden-the-mind", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_STP503.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:56:06Z", "content": "G OING TO UNIVERSITY is supposed to be a mind-broadening experience.

As she reports in Psychological Science this week, she found that those who have been to university do indeed seem to leave with broader and more inquiring minds than those who have spent their immediate post-school years in vocational training for work. However, it was not the case that university broadened minds. Rather, work seemed to narrow them.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Golle came to this conclusion after she and a team of colleagues studied the early careers of 2,095 German youngsters. During the period under investigation (the system was modified slightly this year), Germany had three tracks in its schools: a low one for pupils who would most probably leave school early and enter vocational training; a high one for those almost certain to enter university; and an intermediate one, from which there was a choice between the academic and vocational routes.\n\nThe team used two standardised tests to assess their volunteers. One was of personality traits (openness, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness and extroversion). The other was of attitudes (realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising and conventional). They administered both tests twice\u2014once towards the end of each volunteer\u2019s time at school, and then again six years later. Of the original group, 382 were on the intermediate track, and it was on these that the researchers focused. University beckoned for 212 of them. The remaining 170 opted for vocational training and a job.\n\nWhen it came to the second round of tests, Dr Golle found that the personalities of those who had gone to university had changed not a statistically detectable jot. Those who had undergone vocational training and then got jobs were not that much changed in personality, either\u2014except in one crucial respect. They had become more conscientious.\n\nThat sounds like a good thing, certainly compared with the common public image of undergraduates as a bunch of pampered layabouts. But changes in attitude that the researchers recorded were more worrying. In the university group, again, none were detectable. But those who had chosen the vocational route showed marked drops in interest in tasks that are investigative and enterprising in nature. And that might restrict their choice of careers.\n\nSome investigative and enterprising jobs, such as scientific research, are, indeed off limits to the degreeless. But many, particularly in Germany, with its tradition of vocational training, are not. The researchers mention, for example, computer programmers, finance-sector workers, estate agents and entrepreneurs as careers requiring these attributes. If Dr Golle is correct, and changes in attitude brought about by the very training Germany prides itself on are narrowing people\u2019s choices, that is indeed a matter of concern."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "For Europe\u2019s stockmarkets to recover, bank shares need to rally", "description": "Investor sentiment has curdled from indifference into something closer to hatred", "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/11/24/for-europes-stockmarkets-to-recover-bank-shares-need-to-rally", "urlToImage": "/assets/the-economist-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:55:17Z", "content": "N OT SO LONG ago, a stockbroker trying to interest an American fund manager in European shares would be met with an eye-roll.

The Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro-zone shares is lower than it was 20 years ago. Earnings forecasts have been steadily cut this year. Political risk\u2014from Brexit to Italy\u2019s budget stand-off with the European Union\u2014is never far away and, seemingly, never resolved. \u201cCall me when it\u2019s over,\u201d is the refrain of many American investors. Do not get them started on Europe\u2019s structural defects: its ageing populations, scarcity of world-class digital firms and fragmented markets.\n\nThe category of stocks that captures the prevailing euro-misery best is banks. They have everything that makes investing in Europe such a wretched experience. In a dispiriting year for European markets, the shares of banks and financial firms have been among the worst-performing. Even after the selling, they are a fifth of the MSCI pan-European index. The gloom is now so deep that it would take just a few rays of sunshine to give bank shares a lift.\n\nFor now, though, the news is relentlessly bad. GDP in the euro area grew at just 0.2% in the third quarter. The purchasing managers\u2019 index of activity fell in October to a two-year low. Exports have wilted, notably to emerging markets, where firms listed in Europe earn a third of their profits. A weak economy defers the day when Europe\u2019s central banks can tighten monetary policy. The delay hurts banks, whose profits depend on the interest rates they charge on loans.\n\nEurope\u2019s cyclical failings are entwined with a host of other flaws. Its people are ageing and its businesses seem outmoded. It is not just the preponderance of banks. Stockmarket indices are loaded with makers of cars, chemicals and capital goods\u2014the machine technology of the early 20th century, not the digital tech of the 21st.\n\nNor is Europe a truly continental market in the way that America is. Banking is essentially national. Its capital markets are puny. And it lacks a single set of fiscal-policy tools to go with its single currency. The euro area has no shared deposit protection or unemployment insurance. There are more signs of Europe pulling apart than of it pulling together. One big country, Britain, is going through a messy divorce from the EU . Another, Italy, is feuding with the EU over fiscal rules. The larger these political risks loom, the harder bank shares fall.\n\nIs there anything positive to say about them? European banks are a leveraged play on Europe and also on the global economy, says Luca Paolini of Pictet, a Swiss wealth-management group. That cuts both ways. They are hurt badly by bad news; but they can also rally hard on good news. The starting-point is that shares are cheap\u2014banks are priced for something like a calamity. Yet after foot-dragging for a decade on bad loans and capital-raising, their balance-sheets are in decent shape. Bank credit in the euro zone is growing again (see chart).\n\nA lot of Europe\u2019s political fog would have to clear before its banks could deliver more than a short-term bounce. A softish Brexit would help, of course. So would a truce over Italy\u2019s budget. The euro zone\u2019s structural weaknesses are not going to be fixed quickly. But there has been more progress than is generally recognised.\n\nFrance and Germany recently agreed on a proposal for a European budget. It falls well short of the kind the recession-fighting fund requires. But once it is in place, it might grow in size and flexibility\u2014just as the makeshift rescue of Greece in 2010 evolved into lasting backstops for troubled countries, such as the European Stability Mechanism, a \u20ac410bn ($470bn) bail-out fund. The chance that policymakers move towards fiscal integration in this way is around 30%, according to strategists at Morgan Stanley. This would benefit financial stocks most, they reckon.\n\nThere is one other thing, perhaps a little strange, to say in favour of European stocks, particularly banks: that few investors have anything favourable to say about them. They are a contrarian bet\u2014the antithesis of American tech stocks, which are suddenly out of favour. You buy them when everyone else has given up on them.

He is also thought to be behind a scheme to expand lending to small businesses, and a rejigging of the government\u2019s economic-planning department.\n\nMr Gurumurthy believes, as he put it in a speech last year, that the \u201cthe subject of economics is collapsing\u201d and should be replaced by an Indian economics based on Swadeshi (self-reliance). Foreign capital should be kept out; the government should manage finance directly and small businesses should be prioritised over big ones. Western-educated economists who disagree need a \u201ccorrection\u201d of the mind.\n\nSince joining the RBI board Mr Gurumurthy has turned its monthly meetings into day-long slogs, as he puts forward these ideas, seemingly with the backing of the government. \u201cHis being on the board is not merely some symbolic thing,\u201d says Vivek Dehejia of IDFC Institute, a think-tank. His appointment was followed in October by the squeezing out of Nachiket Mor, an American-educated economist who had been attacked by the RSS . Weeks later Viral Acharya, one of the bank\u2019s four deputy governors, warned that the government was undermining the bank\u2019s independence.\n\nA paragraph-long statement after the latest board meeting, on November 19th, said that the bank would direct more money to small businesses but fudged the biggest question: whether it would hand more cash to the central government. With an election approaching, few think that fight is over. If the government wins, more demands are likely to follow. And one man is sure to be at the front making them."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "As firms struggle with seasonal hiring, Amazon turns to automation", "description": "The holiday sales surge meets the lowest unemployment rate in 48 years", "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/11/24/as-firms-struggle-with-seasonal-hiring-amazon-turns-to-automation", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_FNP001_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:55:17Z", "content": "T O BE HIRED as Santa Claus at Boscovs, a department store in Pennsylvania, you will need to be tolerant of unexpected behaviours from children.

Among the biggest bricks-and-mortar retailers, a record number of 120,000 people are to be hired at Target. Macy\u2019s is hiring 80,000. Since online sales are expected to be a fifth higher than last year, UPS , FedEx and DHL are recruiting furiously, too.\n\nThe tightest jobs market in over a decade means more disposable income, and therefore more consumption. But it also makes it harder to find temporary staff. At the end of the summer there were over a million more open positions nationwide than people looking for work. Kohl\u2019s, a retailer, started hiring holiday workers in June to get a head start. UPS has hosted its first one-day hiring blitz to enlist 40,000 temporary workers, with interviews and driving-test sign-ups in nearly 170 locations. J.C. Penney, a department-store chain, is luring seasonal workers by entering them in a raffle for gifts and holidays. Amazon is hiring hourly workers via an online form, without r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or interviews.\n\nRising wages across the economy help make seasonal work more worthwhile. Amazon is in the vanguard: it raised its hourly minimum to $15 from November 1st. Following the announcement, says Pawel Adrjan of Indeed, the world\u2019s most-visited jobs site, the number of searches for jobs with Amazon in America tripled. It has stayed high since.\n\nTemporary summer jobs, many of them in agriculture, are often taken by migrants who return home afterwards. Temporary winter jobs, by contrast, more often go to locals. The difference is in part because winter work usually requires language skills and is less likely to be covered by special visa schemes, says Andrew Chamberlain of Glassdoor, an employer-review site.\n\nAll this points to a merry Christmas for job-seeking Americans. But the tight jobs market is speeding up a longer-run trend, which may in time flatten seasonal spikes in demand for labour. That is automation. Amazon is ahead of the pack here, too. It is hiring 20,000 fewer workers in America this winter compared with last year, which Mark May, an analyst at Citigroup, attributes to greater use of robots in the retail giant\u2019s fulfilment centres."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "British regulators mull the future of audit", "description": "After high-profile company failures, breaking up the Big Four is on the table", "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/11/24/british-regulators-mull-the-future-of-audit", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_FND001_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:55:17Z", "content": "A UDITS EXIST to shore up trust in financial statements.

Britain provides an illustration.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country has seen a spate of high-profile company failures in the past year, most notably that of Carillion, a construction firm with many public-sector contracts. Angry lawmakers want to know why auditors did not raise the alarm. The result has been a number of official reviews. The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ), Britain\u2019s antitrust agency, is assessing ways to improve the audit market. A separate review is looking at the Financial Reporting Council, the audit regulator. Both will publish initial findings by the end of the year. Three more reviews\u2014by MP s, the opposition Labour Party and an accountants\u2019 trade body\u2014are also in the works.\n\nThe case against auditors is that the industry is cosy and conflicted. Listed companies must, by law, be audited, and the auditors are paid by the companies whose books they review. The market for auditing large listed firms is dominated by four accounting networks, Deloitte, P w C , EY and KPMG , which earn most of their revenue from consultancy. They are barred from providing many consulting services to audit clients. But the suspicion is that they may go easy in audits in the hope of netting more lucrative work in the future.\n\nNot all extra work for audit clients is barred, and Karthik Ramanna of the University of Oxford suspects that audit staff are expected to do what they can to flog such services. Last year the Big Four made \u00a3329m ($424m) from selling these additional services to big clients. That amounts to 39% of their audit fees. Perhaps anticipating stricter rules, KPMG said on November 8th that it would stop providing large audit clients with extra services.\n\nRegulators have tried to inject competition and enforce independence\u2014with mixed success. European Union rules require companies to tender for a new auditor every ten years, and to switch after 20. Though churn has gone up, the Big Four have become more dominant, however. In 2016-17 they audited 97% of the FTSE 350. The Financial Reporting Council found that audits stopped improving in 2017.\n\nThe CMA \u2019s most radical option would be to force the Big Four to separate their auditing and consulting arms. That would reduce conflicts of interest\u2014and could increase choice: accounting firms cannot tender to audit a company they are consulting for. But it would make for weaker firms: auditing is a low-margin business.\n\nAnother option would be to cap auditors\u2019 market share. That could guarantee smaller firms much-needed experience, and over time increase the number of serious players. But in the meantime some big firms would be forced to use smaller auditors. It is not clear that multinationals, in particular, could be properly scrutinised by an auditor with limited global coverage.\n\nAlso on the table is a change to how auditors are hired. If an independent body were to match auditors and companies, that could stop auditors from going easy in order to be reappointed. This option is backed by Grant Thornton, a smaller audit firm. But it has had a tepid reception from the others, who say that it would distance the auditor from a company\u2019s board and from the investors it represents."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Treaty-shopping is about to get more expensive", "description": "Mauritius vows to make it harder for multinationals to use it as an investment conduit", "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/11/24/treaty-shopping-is-about-to-get-more-expensive", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_FNP002_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:55:17Z", "content": "M BIZA, A BUSINESS that grows berries in Zambia and South Africa, and Niel Finance and Services, which owns the Central African Republics largest mobile firm, would seem to have little in common.

It has ratified 15 since 1992; only South Africa arranged more over the period. Twelve more are in the works. Double-taxation treaties ( DTT s) specify the rate applied by source countries on cross-border income, such as royalties or service fees. Over time Mauritius has secured advantageous terms, typically low or zero rates of withholding taxes\u2014those deducted at source. Since it also has treaties with developed markets and other low-tax countries, multinationals with Mauritian intermediaries can repatriate the proceeds of African investments at minimal cost.\n\nDTT s are supposed to encourage foreign direct investment ( FDI ) by making sure income is not taxed twice. But in a recent paper Sebastian Beer of the IMF and Jan Loeprick of the World Bank find that Mauritius\u2019s DTT s have not channelled new investment towards co-signatories. Rather, they have led to \u201ctreaty-shopping\u201d, with firms merely rerouting existing flows of money. That has deprived African treasuries of tax revenue: in countries with such treaties the corporate-tax take was on average 15% lower than in similar countries without them.\n\nSome countries have balked. A handful, including Rwanda and South Africa, have renegotiated their treaties with Mauritius to raise withholding rates on interest payments and royalties. But the most forceful efforts to clamp down on treaty-shopping have been led by the OECD , a club of mostly rich countries, under its \u201cBase Erosion and Profit Shifting\u201d initiative.\n\nIn July it introduced a mechanism that will automatically update applicable DTT s. Rules will be tightened on beneficial ownership and on \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d\u2014ie, whether the main motive for incorporating in a jurisdiction is to obtain tax benefits. Although Mauritius signed up, it initially excluded its African treaties. No public announcement has been made but it has now yielded to pressure and agreed to include all its African DTT s (except that with Cape Verde, which is not yet finalised)."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "A retreat in share prices finally reaches tech stocks", "description": "Anxieties about trade war and a slowing world economy take their toll", "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/11/24/a-retreat-in-share-prices-finally-reaches-tech-stocks", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_FNP502.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:55:17Z", "content": "S TOCKMARKET BOOMS tend to narrow with age, as investors double down on the shares that have served them well.

At their lowest point all five were down by more than 20% from their pinnacle. Billions of dollars in stockmarket value have evaporated. Apple, which had reached an equity capitalisation of $1trn in early August, was valued at $840bn by the time New York\u2019s stockmarket closed on November 20th. The market capitalisation of Amazon, which fleetingly hit the $1trn mark a month later, had dwindled to $731bn.\n\nThe rout in technology stocks was part of a broader retreat in share prices. The S&P index is now barely up over the year. The world\u2019s other big stockmarkets are deep in the red, with China\u2019s worst-hit, down by a fifth since January 1st. Specific factors weigh on the prices of tech shares, such as new concerns about rising capacity in chipmaking. But it would be closer to the mark to say that the anxieties that have undermined the rest of the stockmarket, such as signs of weaker global GDP growth and the trade war between America and China, have caught up with tech.\n\nThere were early tremors last month when a clutch of semiconductor firms endured a rout in share prices. The pattern was repeated when third-quarter results from Nvidia, which makes chips used in digital gaming, fell short of expectations. Its share price plunged. That in turn gave form to latent doubts about the outlook for Apple. Reports that its suppliers were cutting output were enough to send Apple\u2019s share price down by 8.6% over two days. As the economy slows, goes the reasoning, people will be slower to upgrade their handsets. Similarly, businesses would delay non-essential spending, such as advertising, the source of revenue for Google and Facebook. So their shares fell, too.\n\nAmerica\u2019s trade dispute with China can only amplify such concerns. A statement this week by China\u2019s trustbusters that it had evidence of price-fixing by the three largest makers of DRAM chips, used in computers and smartphones, is a new focus for tech jitters. The move was seen by some as a warning shot in the trade wars.

If politicians were to remove them, overcome nimbyism and build more houses, more people could afford to buy. That would arrest a decline in home ownership that has been particularly sharp among young people. In 1991, 67% of British 25- to 34-year-olds owned property; today only 37% do.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo goes the conventional wisdom. But even as policymakers have at last begun to embrace building, a new school of thought has gained prominence. Its advocates, the most vocal of whom is Ian Mulheirn of Oxford Economics, a consultancy, say high prices have little to do with supply shortages. They put the blame somewhere else: global financial markets.\n\nMost studies of Britain\u2019s housing market link a 1% increase in the number of houses to a fall of around 2% in prices. If that is accurate, supply constraints cannot explain a boom as big as Britain\u2019s. Applying these numbers, Mr Mulheirn calculates that had Britain built 300,000 houses per year since 1996, rather than around 200,000, adding 9% to Britain\u2019s housing stock, prices would still have risen by about 134% in real terms in 1996-2017.\n\nThe true explanation, the argument goes, is found by viewing a house as a financial asset. It produces implicit income: the saving on rent achieved by owning the property rather than renting it (or equivalent digs) from a landlord. Like all streams of income, this can be valued using an interest rate. And just like the dividends offered by stocks, or the coupons offered by bonds, monthly savings on rent, capitalised as house prices, have soared in value as global real interest rates have tumbled (see chart).\n\nAnother version of the same argument says that house prices should be bid up until the cost of home ownership\u2014which includes mortgage interest, as well as the lost opportunity to invest in something else\u2014is about equal to rent. Over two decades the real cost of capital has roughly halved, says Mr Mulheirn. So you would expect prices to have roughly doubled.\n\nTo bid prices up to the point where rental yields are comparable to bond yields, households need sufficient access to mortgage credit. That might not have been available, were it not for the \u201cfinancialisation\u201d of housing\u2014the liberalisation of mortgage lending, sometimes funded by foreign capital, in the 1980s and 1990s. One such reform was the advent of buy-to-let mortgages in 1996, which made it easy for individual investors to speculate on property by becoming landlords. Foreign investors may also have contributed to the frenzy.\n\nIf financial conditions can move house prices so much, how to tell if there is a housing shortage? One way is to look at rents, which measure only the supply and demand for a place to live, without any financial component. They paint a startlingly different picture. Since 2005 English rents have fallen in real terms. Even in pricey London, they are up by less than 4%.\n\nSome caveats are necessary. Falling real interest rates are a global phenomenon. Yet housing trends and rental yields vary widely, even within countries. In posh bits of north London they are below 3%; in, say, parts of Liverpool they can exceed 10%. Many globally successful cities have seen rents rise hugely. In San Francisco, for example, where planning regulation is forbidding, rents are 31% higher in real terms than in 2005. Such places would benefit greatly from more supply, with knock-on effects on national economies. High house prices in London may reflect an expectation that building constraints will bite harder in future as the city continues to thrive, causing rents to accelerate.\n\nThe historical link between interest rates and house prices is weak. That is because predictions of future capital gains tend to be what inflate and shrink property-market bubbles. America, Ireland and Spain experienced huge property-price booms in the mid-2000s, even as interest rates rose. Decades of low rates have not restored Japanese house prices to the high they reached amid the speculative fervour of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThat is to build on Mr Mulheirn\u2019s logic, however, not to demolish it. In fact, you might argue that the risk of speculative overheating is another reason not to focus on supply. Those countries that built freely during the 2000s had bigger crashes after the financial crisis, leaving behind ghost towns of vacant homes in places like Nevada and many parts of Spain.\n\nYou can\u2019t handle the roof\n\nSuppose financialisation and low interest rates are to blame for high prices. What, then, should policymakers do? Countries with greater restrictions on mortgage lending, such as Germany, have seen house prices grow much less over the long term than Britain has. But they also have lower rates of home ownership. That would not appeal to politicians in Britain, where \u201cgetting on the property ladder\u201d is seen as crucial to financial security. Buy-to-let investors can be discouraged\u2014indeed, Britain has hit them with much higher taxes in the past couple of years. But that will have only so much impact, since professional firms with large portfolios and access to capital markets can replace individuals. Increases in government subsidies for homebuyers will only inflate prices further.\n\nA sensible approach would be to build more where rents are rising, make life easier for tenants\u2014and abandon the notion that buying a home is a rite of passage. Attitudes could shift naturally if housing were to underperform for a while. Indeed, an implication of the financialisation thesis is that rising interest rates could put the decades-long housing boom into reverse.\n\nSure enough, housing markets in rich countries have begun to look wobbly as global interest rates have crept up. In London, where the prospect of Brexit is also hitting demand, real house prices have fallen by over 2% during the past year. Perhaps young people trying to scrape together towering deposits to buy their first home should hope that the supply sceptics are right. If so, the problem of high house prices might disappear on its own."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Emerging markets\u2019 currencies have staged a comeback", "description": "But threats to growth remain", "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/11/24/emerging-markets-currencies-have-staged-a-comeback", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_FNP003_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:55:17Z", "content": "A FTER DUSK men from Lea Lea, a village in Papua New Guinea, wade into the Coral Sea to spear fish sleeping near the seabed.

Energy prices have since plummeted, but Papua New Guinea\u2019s currency, the kina, has been allowed to fall only gradually. Its strength has hurt the country\u2019s other exports, including coffee, tourism and fish. And because foreign exchange is underpriced, the central bank has been forced to limit its availability. A decline in Papua New Guinea\u2019s currency would, then, be a relief for many.\n\nThat sets the country apart from many developing countries, including several represented at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation ( APEC ) summit in Port Moresby, the country\u2019s capital, last week. Their currencies have already fallen quite enough this year, thank you. Russia\u2019s rouble has declined by over 20% from its highest point of the year to its lowest. Other APEC currencies have also suffered, including Chile\u2019s (which declined by over 15% from its peak to its trough), Mexico\u2019s (over 13%), and Indonesia\u2019s (over 12%).\n\nAt the gathering Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, recalled the speech he gave at the same summit 20 years ago. Back then, amid Asia\u2019s financial crisis and Russia\u2019s default, emerging markets were \u201cthrown into utter disarray by currency speculators [who] were laughing all the way to the bank\u201d, he said. But this year speculators have not had things all their own way.\n\nFew of the big emerging markets still offer foreign-exchange traders anything resembling a one-way bet. The \u201cextreme currency misalignments\u201d that prevailed at the start of the year have now been largely corrected, according to the Institute of International Finance ( IIF ), a think-tank. Better-aligned currencies have also begun to work their magic on trade imbalances. Turkey\u2019s exports were 22% higher this September than last. Its current-account balance could turn to surplus by the end of 2018, according to the IIF . In Argentina, meanwhile, falling imports helped the country post a trade surplus in September.\n\nIndeed, many of the emerging-market currencies that suffered most in the summer have staged partial rebounds\u2014enjoying a snigger, if not quite a laugh, at speculators\u2019 expense. Turkey\u2019s lira bottomed out in August and has since gained over 25%. The currencies of Argentina, Brazil, Russia and South Africa hit bottom the following month and have climbed substantially since. Those of India and Indonesia fell less sharply and bottomed out less quickly. But even they have eked out gains against the dollar in recent weeks (see chart).\n\nFloating currencies can change direction as quickly as the fish in the Coral Sea. Other macroeconomic forces turn more slowly. In Turkey and Argentina, inflation and growth are still heading in an unwelcome direction. Prices rose by more than 45% in Argentina in the year to October, and by 25% in Turkey. Reining inflation in will require a painful slowdown in activity. And that is what is under way. Industrial production in Argentina fell by 11.5% in September, compared with a year earlier. Car sales in both countries are collapsing.\n\nElsewhere, however, inflation remains remarkably contained. In both India and Indonesia it is below 4%, and in Brazil below 5%. Cheaper oil should help reduce price pressure even further. That will weaken one rationale for hiking interest rates and thus reduce one obvious threat to growth. Taken as a group, emerging markets grew faster in 2017 and 2018 than in the two prior years, according to Capital Economics, a consultancy. The sell-off has slowed that recovery but not yet reversed it. And despite the trade war being waged by America\u2019s president, Donald Trump, exports have been surprisingly strong.\n\nThis strength may reflect buyers of Chinese goods racing to place orders before American tariffs rise. Many emerging markets worry that if the trade war escalates, China will let its currency weaken in response, with unknown consequences for investor sentiment. The yuan may be the only major emerging-market currency that has not reached its low for the year. Testy exchanges between the two superpowers during the APEC events in Papua New Guinea will have done little to calm nerves.\n\nFor the host country\u2019s entrepreneurs, the trade war must seem an extraordinary indulgence. They face two adversaries, poverty and geography, that are more devastating than protectionism to trade. Long distances and patchy infrastructure mean that the cost of shipping local handicraft to the outside world can double the price. Crystal Kewe, a 20-year-old self-taught computer programmer in Port Moresby, won APEC \u2019s backing to launch an e-commerce site for bilum, traditional string bags in which Papuans carry infants, food and much family pride. But the cost of shipping keeps export markets out of reach for now. She aims instead to sell to tourists and other visitors, who pay to ship themselves to the product.\n\nThe bags are laden with symbolism, according to Sharlene Kylie Gawi, owner of Bilum Culture, a local bilum business. Each loop is like a member of society. Some bear a lot of weight, others less. Some threads add colour; plainer ones allow the patterns to stand out. But each loop is connected to the others. Thus described, the bags could also represent emerging markets. Argentina and Turkey have stood out this year, yet remained bound to other markets through threads of sentiment. But it is China, as ever, that carries the most weight."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The history and heroes of blood", "description": "In \u201cNine Pints\u201d Rose George explores its science and mystery", "url": "https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/11/24/the-history-and-heroes-of-blood", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_BKP504.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:54:44Z", "content": "Nine Pints: A Journey Through the Money, Medicine and Mysteries of Blood.

The journey of a pint, roughly the amount in a typical donation, from a donor\u2019s vein to the recipient is intricate and fascinating. So is the history of blood science, from the existence of different types to the medicinal use of leeches (now employed in the niche business of alleviating blood congestion in plastic surgery), to lifesaving treatments for major injuries. In \u201cNine Pints\u201d\u2014the quantity of blood in the human body\u2014Rose George surveys the trials, errors and happenstance that shaped blood\u2019s role in modern medicine.\n\nHer narrative is a lively m\u00e9lange of stories about people, culture and science, recounted in sparkling prose. Ms George tours places as varied as Europe\u2019s biggest blood-processing facility (near Bristol), an operating theatre in London, an HIV -ridden slum in South Africa and remote villages in Nepal where women are banished to outdoor sheds when they menstruate.\n\nThe book\u2019s characters come from all walks of life. They include ardent volunteers such as Percy Oliver, a civil servant in London, and his wife Ethel, who in 1921 set up the first register of voluntary blood donors in their home. Their recruits dashed to hospitals when someone needed a transfusion. Sporting pearls and a fashionable hat, Lady Dunstan, an elderly aristocrat, drove an ice-cream van during the Blitz, packed with blood-filled milk bottles\u2014a cog in the wheels of one of the world\u2019s first national blood banks. More recent heroes include Arunachalam Muruganantham, a school dropout from rural India. He invented a low-cost manufacturing process for sanitary pads, which women in developing countries often struggle to afford. To test his prototypes, he carried a balloon filled with goat\u2019s blood under his clothes.\n\nThere are villains, too. They include the bureaucrats who ignored warnings about risky, paid blood donors in the 1970s and 1980s, when tens of thousands of haemophiliacs were infected with HIV and Hepatitis C from tainted plasma, the protein-rich yellow liquid left after red blood cells are sifted out. A page-turning chapter delves into the workings\u2014and ethics\u2014of the plasma business, which is dominated by four companies. America, which has been called \u201cthe OPEC of plasma\u201d, earns nearly as much from exporting it as from medium-sized cars. That is largely because, unlike most other countries, it allows people to be paid for the stuff. Many donors are desperately poor.\n\nMuch about blood remains a mystery. The purpose of blood types, for example, is still unknown; likewise why menstruation is monthly, a frequency that seems inefficient. At the same time blood is becoming even more of a centrepiece in medicine. \u201cLiquid biopsies\u201d, which can diagnose cancers and other diseases with a simple blood test, are among the most promising recent medical developments.\n\n\u201cOur knowledge of blood is wide yet unfinished,\u201d concludes Ms George. \u201cNine Pints\u201d is a superb tour of what is already known about the wondrous liquid that pulses through each body, and what still awaits discovery."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The story of the mob\u2019s man in Hollywood", "description": "Johnny Rosselli was a go-between for Al Capone", "url": "https://www.economist.com/node/21754258", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_BKP503.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:54:44Z", "content": "Handsome Johnny: The Life and Death of Johnny Rosselli: Gentleman Gangster, Hollywood Producer, CIA Assassin.

During the bootlegging years, Rosselli rode the train between Los Angeles and Chicago, delivering messages from the two cities\u2019 respective kingpins, Jack Dragna and Al Capone. When the mob muscled in on the movie business, Rosselli was in Hollywood to keep the unions under mafia control; but he also found time to romance Jean Harlow, a starlet; to dine out with Harry Cohn, a studio boss; and to clink cocktail glasses with Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of Tarzan. Turning to Las Vegas in the 1950s, he schmoozed Frank Sinatra and negotiated with Howard Hughes. And when the CIA hatched a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro, Rosselli was invited to Miami to make the arrangements.\n\nAccording to Lee Server\u2019s exhaustively researched biography, Rosselli lived out a quintessentially American success story. He was a patriot who volunteered to serve in the second world war, and professed to have come from Chicago. But he was actually born in primitive Esperia, in rural Italy, in 1905. As a boy named Filippo Sacco, he joined his father in Boston, but, as Mr Server points out, the country was \u201ca tricky place\u201d for immigrants. \u201cIt needed its foreigners but it hated them too.\u201d\n\nThe teenage Sacco\u2019s drift into crime was perfectly timed. Prohibition became law in 1920, turning petty crooks into tycoons. Previously law-abiding citizens handed their money to racketeers, the racketeers used it to build empires, and those empires lasted long after the Eighteenth Amendment was repealed in 1933.\n\nBy that stage, Rosselli was a fixture among the hoods. Having changed his name and moved to Los Angeles in 1924, he ran shipboard casinos that got around gambling and drinking restrictions by ferrying their glamorous clientele out to international waters. But that wasn\u2019t his only job. He was personable, intelligent and discreet enough, as well as sufficiently handsome, to become the confidant of gangsters and celebrities\u2014and, in the case of Capone, a gangster who was also a celebrity.\n\nWritten in the snappy style of a hardboiled detective novel, Mr Server\u2019s 500-page tome functions as an in-depth history of the growth, development and eventual decline of organised crime in America. The author argues that without the mobsters, America might have done a lot less growing and developing itself. According to this telling, nothing much happened in the middle decades of the last century without crooks facilitating or profiting from it, from Marilyn Monroe\u2019s stardom to John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidency. Rosselli was usually on hand to grease the wheels."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The world of ice and a history of mirages", "description": "They have more in common than it might seem", "url": "https://www.economist.com/node/21754260", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_BKP004_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:54:44Z", "content": "The Library of Ice.

By Christopher Pinney. Reaktion Books; 184 pages; $29 and \u00a318.\n\nH UMAN BEINGS are fond of certainty. They trust their own senses to report what is true about the world, and are mildly outraged when their eyes or ears play them false. They also, often unreasonably, want things to last. Though creation is in flux all around them, from the atoms that make up everything to global weather and the stockmarket, from Moon and tides to the daily flakes and spasms of bodily decay, they like to think that things will stay as they are. Stability is the comforting illusion by which people try to organise their lives.\n\nAnd also extend them. Mortals cling to the hope that they will leave some permanent trace of themselves behind. They prefer to think that houses will not crumble and that works, on canvas or paper, will endure. The grandiose or tyrannical put up monuments; writers make sure their books are deposited in libraries; the multitude order gravestones and label photographs, though all this floats in impermanence too.\n\nTwo new books grapple with this paradox by considering phenomena that symbolise instability itself. In \u201cThe Library of Ice\u201d Nancy Campbell, a young poet, embarks on a quest to understand the relationship between ice, which is now melting faster than ever, and the fleeting written and spoken word. In \u201cThe Waterless Sea\u201d Christopher Pinney, an anthropologist at University College London, considers the history and meaning of mirages.\n\nMs Campbell, a penniless but intrepid traveller, braves miserable bus journeys, freezing rain, dark and intense cold, but still manages to write rapturously of the beauties of the Arctic. Mr Pinney has gone no further than various libraries, but through the words of generations of desert travellers he paints the shimmering heat, the dazzling sand and the strange visions hanging in the sky. He reproduces fascinating postcards, engravings and photos of floating ships and castles, palm trees and palaces that \u201cpossess every possible stability\u201d, including one alleged photograph of a skyscraper city emerging from the Muir Glacier in Alaska. For ice, too, makes mirages, as light refracts through the different temperatures and densities of air.\n\nThere are other unexpected similarities. Walking on the Vatnajokull glacier in Iceland (and sometimes lying on it, to lick up glacial water), Ms Campbell looks down into a world of fissured glass in which bubbles are trapped, as in the toy snow-domes she knew as a child. In historical descriptions of mirages, too, the images seem cut into facets, or viewed through thicknesses of inferior glass with bubbles trapped inside. Ms Campbell notes that all she sees is blue. Blue was also all one writer saw in a Japanese silk-painter\u2019s depiction of a mirage over the sea, \u201cblue vision of depth lost in height\u201d. And the blue of the ocean is itself an illusion created by the rods and cones in the eye, like the blue sky above.\n\nIce is mostly very quiet. But Ms Campbell, eager to link transitory frozen water to transitory frozen words, and delighting in Inuit terms for ice that is too thin, too slippery or frost-flowered, hears anything it has to say. The ice on ponds whoops, bangs and fizzes; glaciers \u201cchatter\u201d as they grind over different kinds of rock. The sound of melting ice has even been turned by Carmen Braden, a Canadian, into a score for ice, piano and strings. Mirages, though mostly silent, can seem to talk, too. In 1834 Alexander Kinglake heard the church bells of home as he dozed in the Near Eastern desert. Some have speculated that, because the images vibrate, they must produce a sound which, somewhere, can be heard.\n\nThe most obvious distinction between ice and mirages is that ice has been used for centuries to preserve what would otherwise decay; whereas mirages seem to show what may exist, in some dreamlike future. Though ice melts away\u2014though nothing remains, save disappearing scratches, of even the most perfect routines of figure skaters\u2014it melts slowly, preserving not only bananas and butter but human habitations and records. Ms Campbell tells the story of the burned-down National Library of Greenland, whose charred books were shipped out, encased in ice, to save them from further damage; and in one especially poignant passage she leafs through the ice-preserved notebook of George Murray Levick, the photographer on Scott\u2019s Terra Nova expedition, noting how his pencil had to dig through the ice-film of his breath on each page. Inevitably she visits \u00d6tzi, the 5,000-year-old traveller preserved by the snows of the Tyrol, with his stomach full of ibex meat and an arrowhead still embedded in his scrawny shoulder.\n\nBut mirages, too, can seem to preserve things. They can appear as long-vanished, astonishingly detailed cities of the dead, or as panoramas of paradise that hold the memories or speculations of ancient tribes\u2014or, in Japan, of clam-monsters. They can even become prisms that crystallise passing moral or political prejudices, such as the supposed illusions (to Western minds) of Islamic teachings, or (to Protestants) the visual trickery of the Catholic church. Mr Pinney enjoys this sharper political aspect of his misty subject. Most cruelly, mirages seem to preserve water that may in fact have shone there, before the desert swallowed it. They encapsulate vain hope; they are real, but they are not true.\n\nAt the end of her wanderings, which are simply but beautifully related, Ms Campbell returns to her few belongings in storage in London. Nothing much remains; treasures have broken; all is in flux, like the heaving, disappearing icebergs she has left behind, with their fragile cargo of human remains. Mr Pinney concludes with Plato\u2019s thought that nothing made or seen on this Earth can be more than a poor representation of the beautiful Ideal. Might a mirage be that elusive original? Do some truths exist that ordinary vision cannot grasp? Both authors seem to feel that, by exploring the impermanence of human thoughts and observations, they may have brushed against something more lasting."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Mapping the making of America", "description": "An imaginative history of the country shows what has and hasn\u2019t changed", "url": "https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/11/24/mapping-the-making-of-america", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_BKP001_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:54:44Z", "content": "A History of America in 100 Maps.

The document he received, coloured like a patchwork quilt, was like none produced before it. Officials had annotated it county by county with data from the 1860 census: the population of whites, slaves and men of military age, heads of livestock and acres of crops. Charging towards Atlanta, Sherman knew exactly where to supply his Union army, which fields of sugar and cotton to burn, and crucially, where resistance would be thin on the ground. Without this data-rich map, he later wrote, his mission would have \u201cbeen subjected to blind chance, and it may be to utter failure\u201d.\n\nMaps are often thought of as records of facts and terrain rather than actors in history. But Sherman\u2019s experience, and that of legions of explorers, colonists and native peoples in North America, suggests otherwise. A map does not merely illustrate the lie of the land, says Susan Schulten, a historian at the University of Denver who unearthed Sherman\u2019s data trove and much more besides for \u201cA History of America in 100 Maps\u201d, a lavish and fascinating atlas. It is also an instrument of persuasion and sometimes of conquest.\n\nFor example, 16th-century European explorers sought a route west from America to China, so they invented waters spanning the continent to convince monarchs to pay their way. John Smith, a founder of the colony of Virginia in 1607, blatantly rewrote reality a decade later by naming a vast swathe of the eastern seaboard \u201cNew England\u201d, replacing native villages with fictitious English towns. Well into the 18th century, meanwhile, California was pictured as an island, a state of affairs that many Californians might cheerfully favour today. Beautiful and strange, this parade of visualisations reclaims the American story from the textbooks and makes it vivid and new.\n\nLike a giant, grown-up flip-book, it demonstrates, step by step, how America came into being. \u201cWildly erroneous\u201d and intentionally deceptive though the earliest of the maps Ms Schulten includes may be, like contemporary letters and diaries they are snapshots of how cartographers and their sponsors thought, and how a new country forms. To name territory is to claim it, enticing settlers, fostering a sense of nationhood, erasing the indigenous population and bison that lie in the way. Yet there was \u201cnothing inevitable about the eventual English domination of North America\u201d, Ms Schulten writes. Santa Fe (Spanish), Jamestown (English) and Qu\u00e9bec (French) were all founded at roughly the same time. Until the mid-19th century the continent was a stewpot of conflicting imperial aims, from Russian and British fur traders to French explorers to the Spanish who once dominated the south-west.\n\nThe book is a brilliant rebuttal to the myth of \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d, replacing the idea of a single historical narrative with something messier and more true: the sheer contingency of events that might easily have gone another way. History, it shows, is as malleable and fluid as the meanders of the Mississippi river, the varying courses of which are pictured over thousands of years (see image below), or the grim heat maps of a rapidly spreading AIDS epidemic. Data is easily manipulated to engineer or reinforce social segregation. Minority neighbourhoods of Cleveland were \u201cred-lined\u201d as \u201chazardous\u201d credit risks in 1936; the \u201cvice\u201d of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown was charted shop-by-shop in 1885. By contrast, the nightlife of Harlem in 1932 (above) was a raucous blend of different races and booze.\n\nAlongside the curiosities, Ms Schulten weaves in eye-popping facts of sharp contemporary relevance. In 1813 the governor of Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry, approved an electoral district resembling a salamander, inspiring the term \u201cGerry-Mander\u201d for what became an enduring political ruse. The United States was fortunate to capture California from Mexico just months before gold was discovered at Sutter\u2019s Mill. The first red-blue electoral map appeared in 1880; it is discombobulating until the reader grasps that the colours are reversed (the Republicans of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Grand Old Party were once shaded blue). Maps of the colony of Virginia help to show the centrality of enslaved Africans to the growth of the tobacco economy.\n\nMs Schulten is a historian, not a geographer. Her aim, she says, is to amplify seldom heard voices, particularly those of African-Americans and native peoples silenced by the headlong rush of westward expansion. But neither does she shortchange America\u2019s fabled can-do spirit, spotlighting the engineering audacity of the Erie and Panama canals and the voyage to the Moon. Strikingly, the cleavage between North and South runs like a fault line through the development of slavery and women\u2019s suffrage to the politics of today.\n\nStill, at a time when the country\u2019s tectonic plates grind ever more fiercely against one another, this book is a reminder that little in its destiny is truly fixed.

In the statement that accompanied his resignation as transport minister earlier this month, Jo Johnson accused his own government of \u201ca failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis\u201d. Others have compared the current debacle to the IMF\u2019 s bail-out of Britain in 1976 or the gold-standard crisis of 1931. In fact it is worse than anything else Britain has endured in peacetime. The political system is all but paralysed, the country is divided into warring ideological tribes, the civil service is overwhelmed and, in the event of no deal, Britain would be staring into the abyss.\n\nSuez is a compelling comparison because it resulted from Britain\u2019s failure to adjust to its diminished status in the world. The crisis paralysed the government for months and forced Anthony Eden to resign. But so what? The Tory party quickly replaced Eden with a much better prime minister, Harold Macmillan, and went on to win the next general election with an enhanced majority. The Brexit crisis has taken a far higher toll on the Conservatives than Suez: the head of one prime minister, David Cameron; the loss of the party\u2019s majority in a botched election; and the resignation of a clutch of senior ministers.\n\nA more apt comparison might be the 1976 episode with the IMF . This was a crisis of a political regime rather than merely a crisis of statecraft. The \u201cButskellite\u201d consensus that had held sway since the second world war was consumed by stagflation and excessive wage demands. In 1976 James Callaghan, the Labour prime minister, decided that there was no alternative but to ask the IMF for a loan. The decision almost tore the government apart, as left-wingers such as Tony Benn pressed the case for a siege economy. But the crisis produced long-term benefits. Margaret Thatcher was waiting in the wings with a radical plan to address Britain\u2019s most pressing problems, such as ossified industrial practices and over-mighty trade unions. Brexit may well do the opposite. The man waiting in the wings is Benn\u2019s disciple, Jeremy Corbyn, who wants to roll back the Thatcher era. Thanks to Brexit, Britain could end up with the siege economy that it managed to avoid in 1976.\n\nAnd whereas the IMF crisis was limited to economic management, the current one extends to the unity of the British state. The four nations voted differently in the referendum, with England and Wales voting to leave and Northern Ireland and Scotland to stay. The Good Friday Agreement deferred the Irish question, which had plagued British politics for centuries, by establishing mechanisms for shared oversight of the North by Britain and Ireland, \u201cpartners in the European Union\u201d. Brexit has put the Irish question back at the centre of British politics.\n\nAnother comparison is with the gold-standard crisis. Britain\u2019s return to the gold standard in 1925 at an unrealistic rate led to a succession of political dramas, as the gold straitjacket squeezed the life out of the economy. A \u201cnational government\u201d of all the parties, led by a Labour politician, Ramsay MacDonald, but dominated by Conservatives, tried to build consensus for economic orthodoxy. But the turmoil intensified. Unemployment soared, strikes spread, a naval base mutinied, capital fled and, on September 21st 1931, Britain abandoned gold. That shook the establishment to its core. But it nevertheless proved salutary in the long run, restoring businesses\u2019 animal spirits and burnishing the reputation of gold\u2019s most prescient critic, John Maynard Keynes. Leaving the EU is unlikely to have any of these beneficial effects. If Mrs May gets her way, Britain will remain closely tied to Europe, a non-voting member of a trade bloc; if she fails to get her way, and Britain drops out without a deal, the consequences will be catastrophic.\n\nYou broke it, you own it\n\nWhat makes the current mess so deadly is that, whereas many past crises were imposed on the British people by the British state, this one was imposed on the British state by the British people. Some Remainers comfort themselves with the illusion that the referendum\u2019s outcome was the result of Russian machinations or Brexiteers\u2019 lies. There is no doubt that the Russians machinated and the Brexiteers lied. But that does not explain why 17m people voted Leave, despite the unanimous advice of the global establishment. They voted in part because they wanted to take back control from an undemocratic Europe, and in part because they considered the British establishment a collection of self-dealing incompetents.\n\nProfound crises demand profound solutions. It will not be enough to change a misguided policy, as happened when Britain abandoned the gold standard or when it withdrew its troops east of Suez. There may be a case for having another vote on Brexit. But that is only the beginning of any serious attempt to deal with the current predicament. The EU must reconsider its indifference to popular worries, particularly about migration. The British establishment must tackle the profound causes of economic frustration and populist rage."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Theresa May runs into trouble with her Northern Irish allies", "description": "The DUP fires a warning shot, voting with the opposition on the finance bill", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/11/24/theresa-may-runs-into-trouble-with-her-northern-irish-allies", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_BRP004_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:54:27Z", "content": "A S IF REVOLT on both wings of her own Conservatives were not enough, Theresa May faces rebellion from the Northern Irish party that props up her government.

She is not reassured by Mrs May\u2019s response that there will be no customs controls and no new regulatory barriers to Northern Irish exports to the mainland. For that leaves open the idea of extra regulatory checks, however discreetly they may be done, on goods that go from Britain to Northern Ireland.\n\nAfter the DUP \u2019 s finance-bill rebellion, the Labour opposition crowed that the confidence and supply agreement was over and Mrs May\u2019s government was \u201cin office but not in power\u201d. Yet the DUP was careful not to cause fiscal damage and says the agreement is not dead. More problematic for Mrs May is its threat to vote against the Brexit deal when it comes to the Commons next month. With as many as 70-80 Tory MP s also promising to vote the deal down, the extra DUP votes seem to doom any chance she may have had of winning parliamentary approval for it.\n\nLike the Tory rebels, the DUP is demanding that Mrs May renegotiate the Brexit withdrawal agreement, which includes the backstop. Yet it is clear that the EU is not prepared to reopen the legal text of that agreement. This week it was fleshing out the accompanying political declaration about future relations, giving countries like France and Spain the chance to raise grievances about fisheries and Gibraltar, respectively. Changes to the declaration at the EU summit due on November 25th could make it even harder for Mrs May to win approval for the deal at home.\n\nThe government has not given up on winning over the DUP . Over half the \u00a31bn bung remains to be spent, after all. And though the party hates the Brexit deal, there are things it may dislike even more. It would not welcome a no-deal Brexit that led to a hard border in Ireland. It does not support a new referendum on Brexit. And it certainly does not want political chaos that could lead to another election. That could not only end its powerful position backing Mrs May\u2019s government but also put into power Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, whom unionists see as an inveterate republican sympathiser."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "A shortage of teachers prompts Teach First to change tack", "description": "It is six years since the government met its annual recruitment target", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/11/24/a-shortage-of-teachers-prompts-teach-first-to-change-tack", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:54:27Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "I N 2002 BRETT WIGDORTZ ,a young consultant, left McKinsey to set up Teach First. The idea was simple: to lure high-flyers, often from elite universities, to tough schools with the promise of networking, quick training and good career opportunities for those who left after a few years. Since then the charity has worked with the government to train around 10,000 teachers, many of whom have gone on to big jobs in the education system.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Teach First is branching out. On November 20th it announced that it would establish three new strands. One will be aimed at those contemplating a change of career, another at those teachers who have quit the profession, and the third at classroom assistants who want to train as fully fledged teachers. Russell Hobby, the organisation\u2019s new boss, reckons that in five years these new routes could account for a third of Teach First\u2019s intake.\n\nThe need for more teachers is pressing enough to justify the wider focus. The government has failed to meet its recruitment targets for the past five years. Last year it fell short by 20%. The proportion of secondary-school teachers leaving the profession early has crept up, from 10.8% in 2010-11 to 11.8% in 2014-15. Worse, the Department for Education\u2019s forecasts suggest that the number of pupils will shoot up over the next decade (see chart).\n\nAlthough all the groups being targeted were already eligible to join Teach First, the new schemes are adjusted to meet their needs. Returners will be offered help finding flexible work, since many will be parents going back to teaching after a break to look after their own children. Career-changers will be paid while they train, unlike other Teach Firsters. One hope is that older recruits will be more willing than recent graduates to work outside big cities. To avoid replicating the efforts of Now Teach, a similar organisation that seeks to hire greying professionals, Teach First will focus on those under 40.\n\nThe expansion will be expensive. It costs much more to train a teacher through Teach First than other paths, and those recruited are more likely to leave the job. According to a report in 2016 by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank, the cost per teacher still in school five years after training is more than \u00a360,000 ($80,000) for a Teach First graduate, compared with \u00a325,000-44,000 for those who enter the job by other routes. (Teach First says its costs quoted here include recruitment, whereas others\u2019 do not.)\n\nThe advantage of Teach First is that it attracts those who might not otherwise have considered teaching, and then directs them to schools with lots of children from poor families, where teacher shortages are most acute. Some old hands remain snooty about the organisation, which they believe too often brings in callow types lacking commitment to the job. Soon, at least, some of Teach First\u2019s high-flying new recruits will not be quite so inexperienced.\n\nCorrection (November 23rd, 2018): An earlier version of the chart incorrectly plotted the number of pupils.

But websites that allow folk to crowdfund legal cases are a new phenomenon. They allow scores of people without a direct interest in a case to cover a proportion of its costs. Some of Mr Day\u2019s backers were fellow doctors who benefited from having their rights confirmed; others were merely sympathisers.\n\nCrowdJustice, the only big player in Britain, set up shop in 2015 and is growing quickly. Though the website is used to fund only a small proportion of court applications, it is increasingly being used in high-profile cases. This week the Parole Board ruled that John Worboys, who was convicted of assaulting 12 women in 2008, should stay in prison, after the High Court overturned its previous decision to release him. Next week the European Court of Justice will hear a case that will determine whether Britain could unilaterally decide to stay in the EU . The cases respectively raised \u00a366,000 and \u00a3176,000 on CrowdJustice.\n\nUntil recently, judicial reviews were typically brought by a relatively small bunch of non-governmental organisations such as Liberty, says Joseph Tomlinson of King\u2019s College London. \u201cThe same few organisations appear again and again,\u201d he wrote in a paper earlier this year. Smaller organisations would be put off by the complexity of mounting a case and the cost, which runs from about \u00a320,000 to \u00a3200,000. CrowdJustice allows litigants to spread the burden. Jolyon Maugham, a barrister, used the site to mount cases for a small trade union and a charity that would not otherwise have been able to bear the financial risks. CrowdJustice is also used to raise cash for humdrum cases in more lowly courts and tribunals, such as immigration and employment disputes.\n\nSome of the cases on CrowdJustice would have been brought anyway, possibly bankrolled by a few rich people. But wealthy backers risk accusations of riding hobby horses or using the law for their own ends. And arriving at court backed by thousands of online donors might increase the perceived legitimacy of the cause. \u201cThe judge sometimes equates the public interest with whether the public are interested,\u201d says Mr Maugham.\n\nSceptics claim that the site amounts to a popularity contest for legal funding, in which only those with the most retweets succeed. \u201cYou have to go off with a huge bang,\u201d says Sam Walton, a peace campaigner who raised \u00a312,000 to fight a criminal-damage charge successfully.\n\nThe most common criticism is that the site acts as a sticking plaster for the dwindling legal-aid budget, which has fallen by a quarter since 2010. The proportion of state-funded judicial reviews has dropped from more than one in four in 2000-04 to fewer than one in 20 in the past two years. Some argue that the success of CrowdJustice might encourage further cuts.\n\nYet plenty of cases never qualified for legal aid. Users are often middle-class professionals who have the know-how to run campaigns, says John Halford of Bindmans, a law firm. \u201cThey\u2019re not poor enough to qualify for legal aid but not rich enough to litigate.\u201d If crowdfunding helps some of them to get to court, it will expand, rather than shrink, the scope of justice."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "What happened after thousands of Gurkhas moved to an English town?", "description": "After a bumpy start, Aldershot\u2019s Nepalese are finding their feet", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/11/24/what-happened-after-thousands-of-gurkhas-moved-to-an-english-town", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_BRP002_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:54:27Z", "content": "L ITTLE KATHMANDU is how some locals refer to Aldershot, south-west of London.

Shopfronts bear notices in the same language, including Namaste Travel and Tours, which advertises cheap shipping to the Himalayas. The quiet Hampshire town and its surroundings are home to more than 6,000 Nepalese, mostly the families of former Gurkhas, recruited from Nepal by the British army.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gurkhas have fought for Britain for more than 200 years. In that time they have lost more than 50,000 men in combat and earned 26 Victoria Crosses, the highest award for gallantry. Widely regarded as fearsome and skilled soldiers, 3,300 serve in the British army; others soldier for Brunei, as well as Nepal.\n\nMany of those in Aldershot arrived following a successful campaign in 2009 to let Gurkhas who had retired before 1997 move to Britain with their families. The campaign\u2019s figurehead was Joanna Lumley, an actress whose (British) father was a colonel in the 6th Gurkha Rifles. Since the campaign\u2019s aim was achieved, the number of Nepalese-born people in Britain has more than doubled, to 65,000. Many have made a beeline for Aldershot, which has been the base for the Gurkha Brigade since 1997, when Hong Kong, its previous home, was handed back to China.\n\nIt has not been easy going. With no previous experience of Britain, some Nepalese were thrown by everything from the weather to traffic lights. Locals who were once enthusiastic about the Gurkhas became less keen as their numbers increased. Two years after the influx began, Aldershot\u2019s MP at the time, Gerald Howarth, warned that it had placed \u201cvery considerable burdens\u201d on local services. Complaints and rumours were spread via Facebook groups with names like \u201cJoanna Lumley has fucked up Aldershot and Farnborough\u201d. Some Nepalese have grown disillusioned, too. \u201cAfter my children have finished their education, I think I will move back to Kathmandu,\u201d says one ex-Gurkha.\n\nBut there are signs that Aldershot\u2019s Nepalese are settling in. The Centre for Nepal Studies UK, a research organisation run by Nepalese in Britain, reports that the community in Aldershot is \u201ccharting the pathways\u201d of social mobility. \u201cThere is an obvious improvement,\u201d believes Chandra Laksamba, co-author of a study of the community in nearby Farnborough. He found that second-generation Nepalese were increasingly getting managerial-level jobs and places at university.\n\nThere has been more cultural integration, too. Tanka Rana, who owns a grand local restaurant, the Palace, is from a family of Gurkhas. After living in England for 18 years, he and his family have adopted local customs, swapping Nepalese dress for jeans and T- shirts, and celebrating Christmas. Each year Mr Rana\u2019s uncle and aunt roast a turkey for the family\u2014they taught themselves to cook it properly, he says, with all the trimmings.\n\nFighting between gangs of Nepalese and British teenagers used to be common. In 2007 Alderwood school, attended by many Nepalese children, was considered by the schools inspectorate to be merely \u201csatisfactory\u201d (translation: it \u201cused to be a dump\u201d, in the words of one local parent). It is now judged \u201coutstanding\u201d. The school says that the performance of Nepalese students has improved and that racist incidents between pupils have become rarer. In 2013 there were ten such incidents; in the past year there have been three.\n\nSport has helped to bring residents together. A few years ago Richard Cooper, a local social worker, created United Rushmoor, a group for residents of all nationalities in the borough to play football. The group has since disbanded as it is no longer needed, Mr Cooper says. An annual football tournament in Aldershot, the Gurkha Cup, also aims to promote integration. Yoz Gurung, a volunteer, claims that it attracts around 15,000 spectators a year, most of them Nepalese."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "England\u2019s surge in violent crime revives talk of merging the police", "description": "Do England and Wales really need 43 separate forces?", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/11/24/englands-surge-in-violent-crime-revives-talk-of-merging-the-police", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_BRP501.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:54:27Z", "content": "H EADLINES ON NEWS-STANDS up and down England make for grisly reading.

Squeezed budgets have cut the number of officers by 15% since 2010. But the crime wave has also revived talk of police reform. England and Wales have 43 forces, from London\u2019s mammoth Metropolitan Police (with 31,075 officers) to Warwickshire\u2019s tiny constabulary (with 823). Some argue that encouraging them to merge, or at least work more closely together, could save money and improve their ability to tackle violence.\n\nA recent change in the illegal-drugs market to a model known as \u201ccounty lines\u201d, where gangs in big cities like London and Liverpool muscle into provincial towns, has sparked turf wars fought across police boundaries. Constabularies are struggling to co-ordinate their response. Small forces in coastal towns are seeing spikes in violence fuelled by drugs networks hundreds of miles away, says Tim Champion, a detective at the County Lines Co-ordination Centre, a national body set up in August. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the scope to deal with it,\u201d he says. Rolling out national initiatives like his takes time, as they must be agreed by the chief constables and commissioners in each district\u201486 people in total.\n\nSome forces are working more closely together, though mainly to save costs. Five constabularies in the East Midlands have merged their back offices and share units for major crimes like murder. It was once hoped that such arrangements might kick-start a process of amalgamation. But alliances are breaking up. Last month West Mercia Police pulled out of its partnership with Warwickshire, complaining that it shouldered too much of the burden. A few days earlier Devon and Cornwall Police scrapped plans to merge with Dorset, owing to a row about funding.\n\nTalk of mergers meets stiff local opposition, not least from the elected commissioners who govern each force. John Apter of the Police Federation, which represents officers, is wary of regionalisation. Bigger forces might struggle to forge relationships with local communities, he says.\n\nOthers believe they would find it easier. Merging forces saves money and would therefore reduce the number of officers lost to future cuts, says Rick Muir of the Police Foundation, a think-tank. And diverting complex crimes like online fraud to national bodies staffed by specialists would take pressure off regular bobbies and help them to get back on the streets.\n\nMergers would not solve every problem, warns Simon Cole, chief constable of Leicestershire. Like most police, he says extra funds are also needed. But Scotland merged its eight forces into one in 2013 and is seeing better results for less money (see article).

Merging was intended to save money by ending the duplication of HR departments, call centres and so on. It was also meant to improve policing. National units would investigate rare crimes like murder, leaving local bobbies to get on with bread-and-butter stuff.\n\nThe fledgling force had a bumpy start. Small constabularies saw it as a takeover by Strathclyde Police, the biggest of the bunch. The spread of armed officers was one aspect of \u201cStrathclydisation\u201d, where tough Glaswegian tactics were rolled out to the sticks. Use of stop and search also increased. Methods that work on inner-city gangs are unsuited to places where duties include rescuing cats from trees, says Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. His party argues that amalgamation has eroded local policing.\n\nGoverning such a large force has proved hard. Claims of bullying and of spying on journalists have dogged its top brass. A new watchdog lacks a clear mandate and is leant on by ministers, says Ali Malik, a criminologist. And the force\u2019s high profile means that policing has become a bigger political issue. The force\u2019s blunders are used as a stick with which to bash the Scottish Nationalist government that set it up.\n\nBut there are signs that the merger is bearing fruit. Although the force lumbers on with a mismatch of computer systems inherited from its predecessors, costs have fallen by 18% since 2012-13. Whereas belt-tightening has led to a drop in officers south of the border, numbers in Scotland have remained stable, at just over 17,000\u2014though many have been stuffed into back-office roles, replacing civilians who were sacked instead. Armed police are once again a rare sight in the Highlands, and reforms are under way to improve accountability.\n\nScottish policing was shambolic before the merger, says Niven Rennie, an ex-head of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents. Competition between forces hampered decision-making, and their ability to deal with complex crimes varied wildly. Centralisation has brought consistency. Rape cases, for example, are now handled by specially trained officers. Victims\u2019 experience has improved significantly, says Sandy Brindley of Rape Crisis Scotland. The police have also got better at going after organised criminals, who do not respect constabulary boundaries.\n\nA popular new chief constable, Iain Livingstone, must now convince a sceptical public that the merger is working. \u201cMerging was the right decision,\u201d says Nick Fyfe of Dundee University. \u201cBut people underestimated how complicated it would be.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The West begins to stir over China\u2019s massive abuse of Muslims", "description": "F EW GOVERNMENTS send ambassadors to China to be brave about human rights.

Officials say the purpose is to stamp out extremism. In a letter leaked to Reuters, a news agency, the ambassadors have asked to meet Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party\u2019s boss in Xinjiang. A hardliner transferred from Tibet, Mr Chen oversees a gulag into which perhaps a million Uighurs have been sent for \u201ctransformation-through-education\u201d, many for indefinite periods without trial.\n\nMillions more endure surveillance by facial-recognition cameras, smartphone scanners and police patrols at every turn. Some must host officials as houseguests, sent to assess their loyalties. China calls these measures vital after terrorist attacks carried out in recent years by Uighur fanatics.\n\nIt is revealing that China seems startled to find itself under ambassadorial scrutiny. It has some reason to be. Chinese officials cynically believe\u2014and will say in private\u2014that Western leaders and envoys raise human rights out of a sense of reluctant obligation, in order to placate activists and public opinion back home. This time, however, the charge is being led by ambassadors, not the public. Envoys in Beijing admit that most people in their countries have never heard of Xinjiang or the Uighurs. They also concede that some folk back home might have mixed feelings were they to learn that the Uighurs stand accused of terrorist leanings.\n\nProtesting Muslim bans, wherever they are found\n\nXinjiang\u2019s agonies are hardly a vital national interest for the first countries to sign the draft letter\u2014Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, joined by the European Union. Instead, a Western diplomat sees a stark test of principle, asking: if we do not protest when a million people are detained without trial, when will we speak out?\n\nThat points to another reason for China to be startled. It is years since human rights seriously disrupted Chinese foreign policy. China won a big victory in 1994 when America\u2019s then president, Bill Clinton, abandoned his previous commitment to make China\u2019s access to American markets conditional on its human-rights record. \u201cWe have reached the end of the usefulness of that policy,\u201d Mr Clinton mumbled, before expressing hopes that China would be changed by engagement with the world. For reasons both selfish and noble, other governments fell in line behind that same plan: a bet that a prosperous China would surely converge with an international order crafted by Western powers after the second world war, based on global trade, universal rights and the rule of law.\n\nChina has not converged. In the meantime, the post-war rules-based order has rarely felt so fragile, thanks in part to the election of populists such as President Donald Trump. That fragility explains why once-meek governments are finding their voices. It is why Xinjiang crashed onto the agenda of the Stockholm China Forum, a twice-yearly gathering of American, Chinese and European ambassadors, diplomats, scholars, politicians and business leaders, hosted recently by Sweden\u2019s foreign ministry and the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think-tank. A speaker predicted that Xinjiang\u2019s woes would \u201cexplode in public opinion\u201d.\n\nNormally dispassionate, the forum saw sharp exchanges about Xinjiang. Speakers described hearings in Washington at which farm-state senators, who once cheered trade with China, used phrases like \u201cOrwellian\u201d and \u201cconcentration camps\u201d. It was noted that China\u2019s high-tech police state appals Europeans, who dread government surveillance, especially in Germany. Defenders of China accused the West of hypocrisy, saying: \u201cThis is not Guant\u00e1namo.\u201d (True: there are only 40 inmates in Guant\u00e1namo.)\n\nTo be sure, the West is not united over how to defend the rules-based order. EU signatories to the ambassadors\u2019 letter are mostly from northern Europe. From the China-led \u201c16 plus one\u201d grouping of former communist countries in Europe, the only signatory at the time of publication was Estonia. Australia, a big exporter to China, signed. New Zealand, another big exporter, did not.\n\nAmerica\u2019s position is hard to predict. In a recent China-pounding speech, Vice-President Mike Pence was stern about Xinjiang. A bipartisan group of members of Congress wants Chinese officials to face sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act, a law targeting human-rights abusers. But America\u2019s envoy in Beijing did not sign the Canadian-drafted letter. Nobody can guarantee that Mr Trump will uphold his government\u2019s line when he sees his counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month at a G 20 meeting in Argentina, rather than beam that China is smart to be tough on Muslim terrorists.\n\nThe wider world is not united. Turkey, which feels bonds of kinship with Uighurs, a Turkic people, was the only Muslim country to rebuke China at a recent meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Other Muslim countries, many of them recipients of Chinese loans, praised China\u2019s human rights.\n\nGlobal argument over Xinjiang is likely to get fiercer. Horrible things are happening.

Justice in China is rarely open for all to see, no matter how much officials insist that proceedings are public. But restricted access to this room, on the third storey of a nondescript building in Qingdao, a coastal city in Shandong province, has done nothing to diminish the attention focused on a recent hearing there. Gay-rights activists, a small but increasingly vocal group, see the case as a landmark one for their cause.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plaintiff is a 32-year-old teacher who claims he was unjustly fired by the kindergarten in Qingdao where he worked. He goes by the pseudonym Ming Jue. Mr Ming says his bosses confronted him after seeing a message he had posted on social media about a gay-pride event he had attended. They claimed that parents objected to the employment of a gay teacher, and said their business would suffer if Mr Ming remained at the school. Mr Ming says that he had tried to nurture the right values among his pupils. \u201cI\u2019ve always taught my students the importance of honesty,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they asked if I was gay I acknowledged it.\u201d\n\nJustice in China is not only opaque: it also rarely involves much argument. Mr Ming only got one 90-minute hearing. He will hear nothing more until the court issues its ruling, probably by the end of November. Mr Ming says that if he wins, it will send a signal that bigotry against gay people is unacceptable. \u201cAnd if we lose, it will show that this society still has more to do to overcome prejudice and discrimination, and I will continue to struggle.\u201d\n\nSince Xi Jinping took over as the country\u2019s leader in 2012, activists of any kind have found it increasingly difficult to pursue their causes openly in China. In 2015 the authorities made it even tougher by rounding up hundreds of independent lawyers and members of their staff\u2014people who had played a vital role in bringing cases to court involving abuses by officials. In the past few weeks the authorities have arrested dozens of university students who have been campaigning on behalf of workers at a factory in the southern city of Shenzhen who want to form a trade union.\n\nLGBT activists struggle on, helped by a gradual change in public and official attitudes. Several cases involving gay rights have come to court in recent years. Rulings have often been unfavourable to the complainants. One suit was lodged in Shenzhen in 2014 by an employee who was fired from an interior-design company after being outed as gay in an online video. He lost the case and his appeal was rejected. But in 2016 a transgender worker who was dismissed from a job at a clinic in Guiyang, another southern city, won partial compensation, despite failing to convince the court that the firing itself was illegal. Last month a judge in Beijing ruled against a challenge to the government\u2019s ban on gay content online. But earlier this year Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, bowed to the demands of activists and gave up plans for a \u201cclean-up\u201d of gay-related material.\n\nDespite some setbacks in court, campaigners see progress of sorts. That gay-rights court cases are heard at all is a small step forward, they believe. So too is the debate surrounding them that bubbles up on social media\u2014censorship of traditional media had previously meant that such discussion was stifled. A graduate law student in Beijing, who is the co-founder of an LGBT advocacy group, compares the approach of activists like herself to that of counterparts in America who, in recent decades, have advanced their cause through the courts. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it will work here, but we are learning and trying to copy this strategy,\u201d says the student, who uses the pseudonym Joan.\n\nOne reason why China\u2019s gay activists appear to have more room to manoeuvre than other kinds of campaigners may be that the Communist Party does not see them as a political threat. (So long as they do not try to form a nationwide movement\u2014the party fears anything national that it does not control.) Unlike environmental activists, advocates for sexual minorities do not face opposition from powerful vested interests, such as polluting industries and the local governments that profit from them. Joan, the activist in Beijing, contrasts the tactics used by her group with those of the students who have been riling the authorities with their campaign for labour rights. \u201cThose guys are much more radical. We work quietly and carefully within the law,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, next year could be a tougher one for activists of every stripe. The party will be on guard against anything that could mar official celebrations of China\u2019s 70th anniversary as a Communist dictatorship. Campuses will be watchful for any unauthorised attempt to mark the 100th anniversary of the May Fourth movement involving nationalist protests by students that led to calls for democracy. In 1989 commemorations of that movement fuelled nationwide pro-democracy unrest. No gay-pride celebration has ever been allowed on the capital\u2019s streets (the picture on the previous page shows a small display of pride in a park). If any parade is permitted next year, it is far more likely to involve tanks, missiles and goose-stepping troops."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "China\u2019s first privately run research university is a risky venture", "description": "Chasing Caltech H ANGZHOU, A CITY south-west of Shanghai, is freighted with meaning for Shi Yigong.

He called it Westlake, after the scenic body of water for which the city is famed. The local government\u2019s enthusiasm also helped. Hangzhou, though rich and historic, compares unfavourably with Beijing and Shanghai in terms of its intellectual endowment. Keen to host a top-class university, it offered Mr Shi tempting terms. Last month he presided over Westlake\u2019s founding ceremony. The university\u2019s first cohort of research students is around 140 strong. It hopes, eventually, to have thousands of students, including undergraduates.\n\nChina already has around 700 private institutions among its 3,000-or-so universities, but most are vocational colleges which do not aspire to compete with the research universities at the top of the global tree. Westlake University does. Mr Shi, a former professor of molecular biology at Princeton who still holds senior posts at Tsinghua, a leading university in Beijing, has Caltech as his model. \u201cThis is the first ever research university supported by both government and the private sector in the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re making history.\u201d\n\nWestlake, for now in temporary premises, will move into a grand purpose-built campus (its design is pictured) in three years\u2019 time. It is private in two ways. One is its governance. Mr Shi stresses that the Communist Party will have a big role in the university. Three of the 12 seats on the managing council are taken by party officials who will play a \u201csignificant\u201d part in decision-making. But the idea is that, unlike in other universities, the board of governors will have ultimate authority. Westlake is also partly privately financed. Although the local government is paying to build the new campus, the university also has private donors, including Pony Ma, the founder of Tencent, a tech giant, and Wang Jianlin, the founder of Dalian Wanda, a property-based conglomerate.\n\nThe point of Westlake is in part to carry out more ambitious research than happens in state universities. \u201cI was very moved by Shi Yigong\u2019s dream,\u201d says Hongyun Tang, a researcher who previously worked in America. \u201cThe academic culture is like the States. We\u2019re all dreaming of doing something big.\u201d His colleague, Xu Li, another returnee from America, says of other Chinese universities: \u201cThey are chasing good publications but not meaningful research.\u201d Mr Li says Westlake\u2019s founder wants researchers \u201cnot to focus on small things, but to make big discoveries.\u201d\n\nMr Shi\u2019s ambitions reach beyond the bounds of the university. His aim is to make China more innovative by adding a dimension to the current educational system. Mr Shi laments that China\u2019s contribution to science and technology in the past 400 years has been vastly below what it could have achieved. \u201cThere\u2019s something etched into our brains: by the time we get to college, students have lost a major portion of their innovative potential,\u201d he says. Mr Shi believes that if elite universities select students on the grounds not just of their test scores, but also of their intellectual maturity and social responsibility, this will influence the way pupils are taught at school, and change the way they think. \u201cWestlake is the first such elite university in China. Our future success will result in the establishment of many more.\u201d\n\nAs the dean of a department at Tsinghua\u2014as high up the Chinese academic ladder as you can go\u2014Mr Shi has a lot to lose if Westlake does not work. In his favour is the explicit endorsement of the venture by China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping. Mr Xi has form in allowing experiments in higher education. From 2002-07 he was the party boss of Zhejiang province, of which Hangzhou is the capital. During that time Mr Xi invited an American college, Kean University in New Jersey, to Zhejiang. Its campus is now up and running. Mr Xi wants China to become an intellectual power as well as an economic one. Against Mr Shi is the rivalrous nature of academia and China\u2019s tradition of conservatism. \u201cEverybody is watching him to see if he succeeds or fails,\u201d says a colleague. \u201cIt\u2019s a big risk.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "A North Dakotan oil-boom city softens", "description": "Bakkenalia W ILLISTON IS LOOKING good these days.

Take the fire brigade. Before North Dakota\u2019s oil boom brought a gush of wealth and population, volunteers had to put out fires in the sprawling, low-rise city. Then its footprint grew threefold between 2009 and 2016, and the number of public employees increased from 75 to 315. Williston chose to get a new fire station with professional staff, but keeping them has proved hard. A firefighter\u2019s annual pay of around $62,000 badly lags behind that of a skilled oil worker. \u201cThey get trained in safety, then take a better paid job on an oilfield,\u201d grumbles David Tuan, the city administrator.\n\nIt is a similar tale for other public-sector jobs. No sooner does the city train a fork-lift driver, say, than an oil firm scoops him up. Perhaps as many as 2,000 jobs, public and private, are vacant in a city of just 26,000. Service-focused firms are most stretched. Supermarkets want to expand but cannot fill shifts. Starting wages in local shops are a hefty $17 an hour.\n\nWilliston\u2019s challenge is to manage abundance. The city is in a remote spot near the Badlands national park. It has seen booms before, and knows they can go wrong. A rush for oil in the early 1980s ended with a bust\u2014\u201cIt was catastrophic, very painful,\u201d says a resident\u2014as jobs went and an indebted city struggled with a falling population. The current fracking expansion also saw a two-year, localised slowdown that ended in 2017.\n\nMost investors, city officials and others nonetheless bet on good times lasting, helped by ever-better extraction techniques. Williston sits on a huge reserve, the Bakken, with billions of barrels of recoverable oil that will take decades to tap. So much gas is flared from oil rigs in the vicinity that the sky glows orange at night, blurring the stars. Gradually more of that gas is being trapped, liquefied, piped and sold.\n\nThe city\u2019s difficulty, environmental damage aside, is how to take long-term advantage. Early this decade Williston won an ugly reputation as a Wild West sort of place. It was the main hub for transient, cash-rich young men who toiled on oil rigs, drove lorries and bunked in Portacabin mancamps. Inevitably it also drew sex workers and drug dealers, and saw a spate of crime, including shootings, especially in bars. \u201cThe town was kinda rough,\u201d says James Hammon, an engineer from Utah who moved in, with his family, in 2013.\n\nThat image threatened to put off non-oil business and also to deter female migrants. So the city is trying hard to rebrand from Wild to Mild West. Residents remain young and rich, with a median age of 31 and average household income of $90,900. But the strip clubs are gone\u2014instead a trampoline park is a much-hyped popular attraction. Mancamps have been banished beyond city limits (to the fury of firms that invested in them) and new hotels have popped up. Williston\u2019s outskirts are getting new housing; downtown is getting restaurants, schools, shops and parks. City officials dream of attracting big brand retailers, tapping hydropower from the Missouri river to run data centres, or using natural gas to power manufacturing plants.\n\nAlmost everything, however, is a bet on oil. The city is paying $240m for a new airport next year to cope with the flow of oil workers. The present terminal, built in 2005, anticipated 7,000 passengers a year. That number now travel every month, says its manager, Anthony Dudas. (He adds that it was tricky to lay down the new runway between the oil rigs in the fields nearby.) City officials have paid over $100m for a new sewerage system and landfills as the population grows towards 50,000 people.\n\nThe result, however, is that public debts are soaring again. Mr Tuan says he worries about servicing them. His sums add up if oil sells for $50 a barrel or more\u2014and so far this year it has been comfortably above that. But there is fragility in relying so heavily on a single industry. Oil pumps nod in almost every field nearby. And for hours, as you drive on through North Dakota at night, rigs dazzle like bases on the moon."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Donald Trump is attacking the rule of law and may well get away with it", "description": "O N THE EVIDENCE available, most Americans do not think President Donald Trump has committed a high crime or misdemeanour.

That was the implication of a remarkable article published on the Lawfare blog this week by the FBI \u2019s former general counsel, Jim Baker.\n\nMr Baker and his co-author, Sarah Grant, made their point, without referring to Mr Trump specifically, by drawing on a newly released trove of evidence from the Watergate investigation. They focused on Nixon\u2019s effort to lean on a Justice Department official, Henry Petersen, who was overseeing it at the time. Nixon repeatedly asked whether he was under investigation. After Petersen informed him that two of his senior aides were, and should be sacked, the president defended them as \u201cfine, upstanding guys\u201d. As an effort to derail the investigation in order to save himself, Nixon\u2019s action represented, according to one of the three impeachment articles he later faced, a \u201cdisregard of the rule of law\u201d.\n\nThe parallels between then and now are unmistakable. Mr Trump badgered James Comey to say whether he was under investigation in the Russia probe that the then FBI director was leading. After the acting attorney-general, Sally Yates, informed the administration that Mr Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Flynn, had had secret communications with Russian officials and lied about them, Mr Trump sought to protect him. According to Mr Comey, the president urged him to lay off Mr Flynn because he was a \u201cgood guy\u201d. After Mr Comey refused, Mr Trump sacked his FBI director. Significantly, Mr Baker was one of half a dozen FBI officials briefed by Mr Comey on these developments at the time.\n\nWhether Mr Trump\u2019s alleged transgression was as bad as Nixon\u2019s may depend, in another Watergate parallel, on what he knew about the Russian plot and when he knew it. Robert Mueller, to whom the president\u2019s lawyers dispatched a long-awaited list of written responses to questions this week, is trying to ascertain that. The special counsel is reported to be probing what Mr Trump knew about the Russians\u2019 effort to hack his Democratic opponent\u2019s emails, shortly after he had urged them to do so, and what he knew about a meeting of his senior advisers with a group of well-connected Russians who were promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Perhaps, in the absence of a smoking gun, the special counsel will find Mr Trump has no case to answer. But either way he seems unlikely to suffer Nixon\u2019s fate.\n\nThat is partly because the tribal loyalties that might have saved Nixon are fiercer now. On the day he resigned, after being informed that Republican congressmen would not defend him, half his party\u2019s voters still backed him. With the benefit of stronger partisanship, weaker politicians and a 24/7 propaganda machine in Fox News, Mr Trump could count on stiffer Republican protection.\n\nAnother reason he appears likelier to lower the standards of his office than to be held accountable to them relates to the peculiarities of his political persona. Nixon was a committed rule-breaker who pretended not to be. When the evidence against him emerged, it was therefore damning. By contrast, Mr Trump has consistently promised even more dramatic rule-breaking than he has delivered\u2014almost no matter what Mr Mueller may find.\n\nHe vowed to jail Hillary Clinton. Yet after being advised by his White House counsel to drop that idea, it was reported this week, he did so. He has threatened to shut down Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation since it was launched. In that context, his allegedly improper remarks to Mr Comey might seem modest; or at worst consistent with what he has been saying openly. Mr Trump has in this way scrambled expectations of presidential behaviour.\n\nThe favourite mantra of Trump apologists\u2014\u201cTake note of what the president does, not what he says\u201d\u2014is illustrative of that. It makes sense only when measured against the most dramatic, and indeed unimaginable, of his threats. That is in part because the president\u2019s words also have impacts. Over the course of his near-daily attacks on Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation and the Justice Department, Republican trust in those institutions has collapsed.\n\nIt is also nonsense because, while not following through on his biggest threats, Mr Trump is making good on a lot of lesser ones, which would in normal times be considered beyond the pale. \u201cI measure a president\u2019s sensitivity to the rule of law by his actions, not his off-the-cuff comments, tweets or statements,\u201d huffed one of his most shameless defenders, Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, this week. This rather skated over the fact that Mr Trump had just sacked his attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, and appointed in his place an inexperienced and possibly illegitimate acting successor, Matthew Whitaker. And that he did so, a reasonable understanding of his words suggests, in a bid to derail Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation into himself and his closest family members.\n\nWhat the Framers feared\n\nIf the special counsel survives that manoeuvre, he will not recalibrate his view of the rule of law as Mr Leo has. That is why the president fears him. Yet any damning verdict on Mr Trump by Mr Mueller would be effective only if there is political will to enforce it. That is why the president\u2019s assault on the dignity of his office and Congress\u2019s related unwillingness to constrain him is so serious. There is a reasonable view that, to instigate a constitutional crisis, he would have to defy a court order or subpoena. An alternative view is that the corrosive effect of his lesser but relentless war on the political system will ensure that the need for such high-risk defiance will never arise."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Our Charlottesville cover", "description": "GRAEME JAMES, who designs our covers, has won the British Society of Magazine Editors\u2019 cover of the year, for the issue of August 19th 2017 that featured Donald Trump\u2019s reaction to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/11/24/our-charlottesville-cover", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_USD010_1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:53:30Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "G RAEME JAMES , who designs our covers, has won the British Society of Magazine Editors\u2019 cover of the year, for the issue of August 19th 2017 that featured Donald Trump\u2019s reaction to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The big, beautiful border wall America built ten years ago", "description": "That open border exposed I N OCTOBER 2006 George W.

A further $450m was incurred in maintenance costs, which will continue to grow.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to put up a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d along the rest of the 2,000-mile southern border helped take him to the White House. Now he is threatening to trigger a partial government shutdown on December 7th unless Congress stumps up for his pet project. (\u201cThis would be a very good time to do a shutdown\u201d, he mused recently.) Mr Trump\u2019s wall would be much larger than the last attempt. He wants $5bn in this fiscal year. An earlier deal struck with Democrats allocated only $1.6bn for border security. The cost of a full wall could be $25bn (and no, Mexico will not be paying for it).\n\nSo what effect did the first 550 miles have? Not much, suggests an analysis by economists at Dartmouth and Stanford Universities. Arrests at the southern border dropped after the fence was built, but this cannot be attributed completely to the wall, since those years also saw a deep recession. Still, by using a confidential data source\u2014the ID cards issued by the Mexican government, through its consulate, to its citizens living as immigrants in America, many of them illegally\u2014the economists have isolated the effect of the new fencing on migration flows. And they calculate that it reduced the number of Mexican citizens living in America by only 0.6%.\n\nBut perhaps it shored up American wages? Sadly, no. College-educated Americans came out worse, losing about $4.35 per person in annual income. Low-skilled workers without a college education came off only slightly better\u2014gaining 36 cents of income\u2014because of reduced competition in the labour market. This is a pittance next to the $7 per person paid for the wall\u2019s construction (to say nothing of the big maintenance and personnel bills to come). Because of lost workers, American GDP probably shrank by $2.5bn (0.02%) overall.\n\nMexicans immigrate to America illegally because of the lure of high-paying jobs. Policies that increase wages in Mexico tend to drive down migration. Cross-border trade costs more than trade within America over the same distance due to tariffs and border delays. The authors simulate the effects of a 25% reduction in cross-border trade costs and find that migration would have shrunk more than under the Secure Fence Act (by an additional 34%). Yearly benefits for both uneducated and educated American workers would increase\u2014by $59 per head and $81 per head, respectively.\n\nAll this suggests that Mr Trump\u2019s approach\u2014jeopardising trade relations with Mexico while also agitating for a larger wall\u2014is inconsistent if he aims to reduce illegal immigration from Mexico. If the aim is just to make many voters feel better, there are cheaper ways of doing that, too.\n\n* \u201cBorder Walls\u201d by Treb Allen, Cau\u00ea de Casto Dobbin and Melanie Morten, NBER working paper."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Democrats and a climate-change dilemma", "description": "C LIMATE POLICY in America has always been an up-and-down affair.

But few reversals have been as dramatic as the replacement of Barack Obama with Donald Trump. Unlike his predecessor, the current president is sceptical about climate change and loves \u201cbeautiful, clean\u201d coal. The environmental agencies are stocked with former lobbyists for coal, fracking and chemicals companies. And yet according to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) the amount of greenhouse gases emitted in America dropped by 2.7% in his first year of office. This was the biggest reduction anywhere in the rich world.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Wheeler, the former coal lobbyist who now heads the EPA , has been quick to praise \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s regulatory reform agenda\u201d for this. In fact, the decline has little to do with the president\u2019s policies. America\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions have been on a downward trajectory since 2007, mostly because power plants have been switching to cheaper, cleaner natural gas and away from Mr Trump\u2019s beloved rock. According to the Energy Information Administration, a government agency, America guzzled nearly equal quantities of coal and natural gas in 2007. Today natural gas provides twice as much energy as coal. Energy from renewable sources, like wind and solar, now make up just over 10% of America\u2019s energy consumption.\n\nSince 2010 nearly 40% of the country\u2019s coal-generating capacity has either been shut down or designated for closure. This is mostly because rival fuels were cheaper, rather than the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which was much derided but never actually went into effect. Even under Mr Trump, coal plants are expected to shut down 11.4 GW of capacity this year, the most since 2015. No American utility plans to build a new coal-fired plant; most of the existing ones are at least 40 years old. The environmental regulations that the Trump administration is trying to undo will not restore the coal industry to its glory days, though they might slow its decline.\n\nThat is because America\u2019s relative success at decarbonisation is mainly a result of market forces. Though these will continue to operate, the dent in emissions will be smaller than if the federal government joined in too. On current trends, carbon dioxide emissions will be 17% lower in 2025 than they were in 2005, some way short of the 26-28% reductions envisaged in the Paris Agreement, which Mr Trump withdrew from, or the Clean Power Plan. This improvement is too gradual to avoid the disastrous consequences predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of a world that is 2\u00b0 C warmer.\n\nFor those reasons, if there is a struggling power sector the administration wishes to foster, nuclear would be a worthier candidate than coal. Done with enough determination, propping up coal could stall progress towards decarbonising the economy. Nuclear energy, on the other hand, produces little carbon dioxide (though uranium mining and milling does have a small effect). Yet capacity has been stuck since 2000, and plants have floundered financially because gas is cheap and there is no reward for the absence of pollution which is nuclear\u2019s main selling point.\n\nThe best policy to rectify this would be a carbon tax, yet carbon taxes are easily denounced as energy taxes, which voters do not much appreciate. That leaves Democrats, soon to take power in the House of Representatives, in a bind. With Republicans still controlling the Senate and the White House, a vote for a carbon tax looks like a self-defeating political strategy and a self-defeating climate strategy, because it could lose the Democratic majority, says Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser to Bill Clinton. If House Democrats want to pass bills, they will find that Republicans representing districts with nuclear plants or wind turbines like tax credits for those technologies, says Matthew Nisbet of Northeastern University.\n\nWhich path Democrats pursue will depend on their choice of leader. Nancy Pelosi, who is drumming up support to be named Speaker of the House once again, is a pragmatic tactician who is unlikely to bring risky votes to the floor. But Ms Pelosi faces an open rebellion to her rule. At the same time, a coalition of newly elected Democrats is agitating for a green New Deal that would make America carbon neutral within ten years. The most famous of the band, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, spent her first day in Washington as a member-elect joining a sit-in of environmental protesters. Their chosen venue was not the White House, but Ms Pelosi\u2019s office."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The Earned Income Tax Credit almost pays for itself", "description": "D EMOCRATS AND Republicans can sometimes agree that splashing water on things might make them wet, but not on much else.

How remarkable, then, that the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ), which tops up the earnings of low earners, is beloved by politicians of all stripes. EITC is one of the most effective government programmes. Analysis from the Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think-tank, finds that it boosts the income of around 28m Americans every year, lifting 9m of them above the poverty line. A new working paper finds the programme might be even better than was previously realised, because it costs so little to administer.*\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study, written by Jacob Bastian, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Chicago, and Maggie Jones of the Census Bureau, points to two reasons why the EITC costs taxpayers less than is generally understood. First, the EITC , unlike many other welfare programmes, is designed to encourage more people to work, since only the employed can receive benefits. This results in a bigger pool of people paying income tax. Second, the EITC raises incomes of the poor, which means fewer are dependent on other forms of welfare. Mr Bastian and Ms Jones find that once you take these two factors into account, every dollar the government notionally spends on the EITC costs taxpayers just 13 cents on net.\n\nAlthough the EITC is generally well-regarded, it does have some kinks. A single person without children can only receive benefits if they earn less than $15,270 a year, or roughly the federal minimum wage. They also can only receive up to $519. By contrast a parent with one child can receive up to $3,461. A single parent with one child can claim benefits if they earn less than $40,320, while a couple with one child can claim benefits if they earn less than a combined $46,010.\n\nThis means the programme has a bigger impact on the behaviour of some than on others. Research has found single mothers are the most likely to join the workforce because of the EITC . The tax credit has little effect on the employment rates of fathers since they are more likely to have jobs anyway. The EITC also has some downsides. Married women who are not their families\u2019 chief breadwinners are actually discouraged from working if their households are near the eligibility threshold.\n\nThe fact that the EITC makes people richer, and hence less likely to be eligible for other kinds of welfare programmes, might mean some of its reported benefits have been overstated. But past research has found that beyond its impact on household finances, the EITC has also been shown to lower crime rates for women, and to improve health and education. Mr Bastian reckons the EITC might have further positive effects: single mothers who are nudged into work, might serve as better role models for their kids, for instance.\n\nThe EITC does have one glaring shortcoming: it does little to help the childless. America\u2019s labour-force participation rate is below that of many other rich countries, including Britain, Canada and Germany. Closing this gap would be a boon for the economy. But convincing a discouraged worker to start looking for jobs again will probably take more than $519 a person.\n\n*\u201cDo EITC expansions pay for themselves?

By Christopher Pinney. Reaktion Books; 184 pages; $29 and \u00a318.\n\nH UMAN BEINGS are fond of certainty. They trust their own senses to report what is true about the world, and are mildly outraged when their eyes or ears play them false. They also, often unreasonably, want things to last. Though creation is in flux all around them, from the atoms that make up everything to global weather and the stockmarket, from Moon and tides to the daily flakes and spasms of bodily decay, they like to think that things will stay as they are. Stability is the comforting illusion by which people try to organise their lives.\n\nAnd also extend them. Mortals cling to the hope that they will leave some permanent trace of themselves behind. They prefer to think that houses will not crumble and that works, on canvas or paper, will endure. The grandiose or tyrannical put up monuments; writers make sure their books are deposited in libraries; the multitude order gravestones and label photographs, though all this floats in impermanence too.\n\nTwo new books grapple with this paradox by considering phenomena that symbolise instability itself. In \u201cThe Library of Ice\u201d Nancy Campbell, a young poet, embarks on a quest to understand the relationship between ice, which is now melting faster than ever, and the fleeting written and spoken word. In \u201cThe Waterless Sea\u201d Christopher Pinney, an anthropologist at University College London, considers the history and meaning of mirages.\n\nMs Campbell, a penniless but intrepid traveller, braves miserable bus journeys, freezing rain, dark and intense cold, but still manages to write rapturously of the beauties of the Arctic. Mr Pinney has gone no further than various libraries, but through the words of generations of desert travellers he paints the shimmering heat, the dazzling sand and the strange visions hanging in the sky. He reproduces fascinating postcards, engravings and photos of floating ships and castles, palm trees and palaces that \u201cpossess every possible stability\u201d, including one alleged photograph of a skyscraper city emerging from the Muir Glacier in Alaska. For ice, too, makes mirages, as light refracts through the different temperatures and densities of air.\n\nThere are other unexpected similarities. Walking on the Vatnajokull glacier in Iceland (and sometimes lying on it, to lick up glacial water), Ms Campbell looks down into a world of fissured glass in which bubbles are trapped, as in the toy snow-domes she knew as a child. In historical descriptions of mirages, too, the images seem cut into facets, or viewed through thicknesses of inferior glass with bubbles trapped inside. Ms Campbell notes that all she sees is blue. Blue was also all one writer saw in a Japanese silk-painter\u2019s depiction of a mirage over the sea, \u201cblue vision of depth lost in height\u201d. And the blue of the ocean is itself an illusion created by the rods and cones in the eye, like the blue sky above.\n\nIce is mostly very quiet. But Ms Campbell, eager to link transitory frozen water to transitory frozen words, and delighting in Inuit terms for ice that is too thin, too slippery or frost-flowered, hears anything it has to say. The ice on ponds whoops, bangs and fizzes; glaciers \u201cchatter\u201d as they grind over different kinds of rock. The sound of melting ice has even been turned by Carmen Braden, a Canadian, into a score for ice, piano and strings. Mirages, though mostly silent, can seem to talk, too. In 1834 Alexander Kinglake heard the church bells of home as he dozed in the Near Eastern desert. Some have speculated that, because the images vibrate, they must produce a sound which, somewhere, can be heard.\n\nThe most obvious distinction between ice and mirages is that ice has been used for centuries to preserve what would otherwise decay; whereas mirages seem to show what may exist, in some dreamlike future. Though ice melts away\u2014though nothing remains, save disappearing scratches, of even the most perfect routines of figure skaters\u2014it melts slowly, preserving not only bananas and butter but human habitations and records. Ms Campbell tells the story of the burned-down National Library of Greenland, whose charred books were shipped out, encased in ice, to save them from further damage; and in one especially poignant passage she leafs through the ice-preserved notebook of George Murray Levick, the photographer on Scott\u2019s Terra Nova expedition, noting how his pencil had to dig through the ice-film of his breath on each page. Inevitably she visits \u00d6tzi, the 5,000-year-old traveller preserved by the snows of the Tyrol, with his stomach full of ibex meat and an arrowhead still embedded in his scrawny shoulder.\n\nBut mirages, too, can seem to preserve things. They can appear as long-vanished, astonishingly detailed cities of the dead, or as panoramas of paradise that hold the memories or speculations of ancient tribes\u2014or, in Japan, of clam-monsters. They can even become prisms that crystallise passing moral or political prejudices, such as the supposed illusions (to Western minds) of Islamic teachings, or (to Protestants) the visual trickery of the Catholic church. Mr Pinney enjoys this sharper political aspect of his misty subject. Most cruelly, mirages seem to preserve water that may in fact have shone there, before the desert swallowed it. They encapsulate vain hope; they are real, but they are not true.\n\nAt the end of her wanderings, which are simply but beautifully related, Ms Campbell returns to her few belongings in storage in London. Nothing much remains; treasures have broken; all is in flux, like the heaving, disappearing icebergs she has left behind, with their fragile cargo of human remains. Mr Pinney concludes with Plato\u2019s thought that nothing made or seen on this Earth can be more than a poor representation of the beautiful Ideal. Might a mirage be that elusive original? Do some truths exist that ordinary vision cannot grasp? Both authors seem to feel that, by exploring the impermanence of human thoughts and observations, they may have brushed against something more lasting."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The story of the mob\u2019s man in Hollywood", "description": "Handsome Johnny: The Life and Death of Johnny Rosselli: Gentleman Gangster, Hollywood Producer, CIA Assassin.

During the bootlegging years, Rosselli rode the train between Los Angeles and Chicago, delivering messages from the two cities\u2019 respective kingpins, Jack Dragna and Al Capone. When the mob muscled in on the movie business, Rosselli was in Hollywood to keep the unions under mafia control; but he also found time to romance Jean Harlow, a starlet; to dine out with Harry Cohn, a studio boss; and to clink cocktail glasses with Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of Tarzan. Turning to Las Vegas in the 1950s, he schmoozed Frank Sinatra and negotiated with Howard Hughes. And when the CIA hatched a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro, Rosselli was invited to Miami to make the arrangements.\n\nAccording to Lee Server\u2019s exhaustively researched biography, Rosselli lived out a quintessentially American success story. He was a patriot who volunteered to serve in the second world war, and professed to have come from Chicago. But he was actually born in primitive Esperia, in rural Italy, in 1905. As a boy named Filippo Sacco, he joined his father in Boston, but, as Mr Server points out, the country was \u201ca tricky place\u201d for immigrants. \u201cIt needed its foreigners but it hated them too.\u201d\n\nThe teenage Sacco\u2019s drift into crime was perfectly timed. Prohibition became law in 1920, turning petty crooks into tycoons. Previously law-abiding citizens handed their money to racketeers, the racketeers used it to build empires, and those empires lasted long after the Eighteenth Amendment was repealed in 1933.\n\nBy that stage, Rosselli was a fixture among the hoods. Having changed his name and moved to Los Angeles in 1924, he ran shipboard casinos that got around gambling and drinking restrictions by ferrying their glamorous clientele out to international waters. But that wasn\u2019t his only job. He was personable, intelligent and discreet enough, as well as sufficiently handsome, to become the confidant of gangsters and celebrities\u2014and, in the case of Capone, a gangster who was also a celebrity.\n\nWritten in the snappy style of a hardboiled detective novel, Mr Server\u2019s 500-page tome functions as an in-depth history of the growth, development and eventual decline of organised crime in America. The author argues that without the mobsters, America might have done a lot less growing and developing itself. According to this telling, nothing much happened in the middle decades of the last century without crooks facilitating or profiting from it, from Marilyn Monroe\u2019s stardom to John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidency. Rosselli was usually on hand to grease the wheels."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "A rebellion in the Conservative ranks fizzles out", "description": "A botched coup suggests Tory Eurosceptics hold less sway they thought", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/11/24/a-rebellion-in-the-conservative-ranks-fizzles-out", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_BRP001_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T14:09:09Z", "content": "M Y LITTLE CHILDREN let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth.

Plenty had promised to send in one of the 48 letters needed to trigger a confidence vote in the prime minister. But almost a week after the young fogey in charge of the revolt, Jacob Rees-Mogg, announced the rebellion, not enough actually had.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not supposed to be like this. For months, breathless reports from anonymous MP s suggested that just a few more letters were necessary. Mr Rees-Mogg and his allies in the European Research Group (ERG) of Eurosceptic Tory MP s were said to have a gun held to the prime minister\u2019s head, and be willing to pull the trigger if they did not like the Brexit deal she had brought home from Brussels. In the end, they fired a blank.\n\nHardline Tory Brexiteers are loud in voice, but small in number. They are dwarfed by a more pragmatic wing of the party, which includes the bulk of Conservative MP s, though it generates less press coverage. \u201c ERG leaders are ideologues,\u201d says one former minister. \u201cMost Conservatives, including most Leavers, are not.\u201d The fight is between pragmatists, happy to compromise for the sake of power, and a minority who have an ideological commitment to reclaiming every last scrap of sovereignty from the European Union, he says.\n\nUnfortunately for Mrs May, an abundance of pragmatic MP s does not make her life much easier. Her main problem in the next few weeks will not be fending off half-baked leadership plots, but pushing her Brexit deal through Parliament. Although the ideologues are few, the government\u2019s majority is even smaller. Mrs May depends on the support of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which is wobbling (see article). Mr Rees-Mogg\u2019s band of Brexiteers might struggle to bring down the prime minister, but they may well stop her deal.\n\nA small tail of Europe-obsessed MP s has wagged the Conservative Party dog for decades. In the last few years of David Cameron\u2019s government, Eurosceptic MP s were cast as crack guerrillas. Under the stewardship of Steve Baker, one of those behind the attempted coup against Mrs May, they forced Mr Cameron to retreat over the terms of the Brexit referendum, bullying him into enforcing purdah (when the government stops introducing new measures during election campaigns). After the referendum was won, Mr Baker boasted of having read \u201cThe 33 Strategies of War\u201d, a self-help book which claims to distil the wisdom of Napoleon, Clausewitz and Alexander the Great. Now the ERG is more often compared to \u201cDad\u2019s Army\u201d, a sitcom about a hapless platoon of volunteers in the second world war.\n\nOn the opposite side of the Tory party, Remainer MP s are making trouble. Earlier this month Jo Johnson, a brother of Brexiteer Boris, resigned as transport minister and called for a second referendum, to pit Mrs May\u2019s deal against the alternatives of remaining in the EU and leaving without a deal. Tory MP s complain that their inboxes are deluged with demands for both extremes: a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d on one hand, or a no-deal Brexit on the other. (Emails about more mundane topics, like delayed trains, still outnumber both.)\n\nMost Conservative MP s want neither a leadership contest nor a second referendum. Getting Brexit over with is more important. To them, the deal is good enough, and they suspect voters will feel the same. Though two cabinet ministers, including the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, resigned over Mrs May\u2019s deal, the rest, notably Michael Gove, environment secretary and leading figure in the Leave campaign, have swallowed their concerns. After all, some Brexit is better than no Brexit, which Mrs May threatens could be the result if Parliament rejects the deal. \u201cMost people are not idiots and do not expect the moon on toast,\u201d says one MP whose constituency voted narrowly to leave.\n\nIn the grassroots, it is another story. As the party\u2019s membership has shrunk, it has become more extreme in its views. Today\u2019s Conservative members are much more interested in Brexit than bake sales, worry MP s and aides. An increasingly Eurosceptic membership has caused some MP s to look at the rise of the Tea Party in the Republican ranks in America, where radical activists dragged the party to the right.\n\nThe threat to Mrs May is not over. Some 26 MP s publicly claim to have put in letters. Another handful may have done so secretly. It would not take many more for Mrs May to face a confidence ballot. If Parliament rejects her Brexit deal, a confidence vote may be in the offing, predicts one backbench Machiavelli who steered clear of Mr Rees-Mogg\u2019s plot. In that context, Tory MP s could say they were acting in the national interest\u2014changing the prime minister in order to get a Brexit deal through\u2014rather than engaging in a bout of regicide for internal reasons.\n\nAt the moment, Downing Street fancies a fight. Mrs May has won the grudging respect, if not the affection, of voters. A poll by YouGov finds that 46% want her to stay in the job, compared with 33% a week ago. The spectacle of unserious MP s trying and failing to remove her suits the prime minister\u2019s aides, who like to portray her as a serious woman getting on with a difficult job. If MP s do stumble over the 48-letter threshold, Mrs May would probably win the confidence motion. Under party rules, another vote could not be held for a year.\n\nStill, nothing is guaranteed. Public pledges of support can turn into something else in the privacy of a voting booth. As Mr Rees-Mogg found out, word and deed do not always match in the Tory party."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "A British academic is jailed for life in the United Arab Emirates", "description": "The country presents itself as a cheerful, cosmopolitan place, but it offers little space for intellectuals", "url": "https://www.economist.com/news/2018/11/21/a-british-academic-is-jailed-for-life-in-the-united-arab-emirates", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_MAP501.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T13:51:14Z", "content": "A FTER FIVE months in solitary confinement, his final court appearance lasted barely five minutes.

The cause of this chaos is that those with long-standing delusions about what Brexit would mean have been forced to swallow a dose of reality.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith negotiating time almost up, Britain has the imperfect deal that it was always going to get. Promises of having cake and eating it have given way to a less appetising offering. Yet among Brexiteers, one hopeful fantasy lives on: the idea that, if all else fails, Britain can prosper outside the European Union without signing a deal at all. The idea\u2019s proponents tout a no-deal Brexit as a way to avoid giving ground, or money, to Brussels. They dismiss objections as another round of the alarmist \u201cProject Fear\u201d that Remainers deployed before the referendum.\n\nThey are gravely mistaken. It is time to debunk the last, and most dangerous, of the Brexit fantasies.\n\nThe notion that Britain should leave the EU without agreeing on exit terms or paying its tab has gained currency. Perhaps two dozen Tory MP s want such an outcome, now that a cake-and-eat-it deal is off the menu. Given the government\u2019s wafer-thin majority, this small band has undue clout (see article). Assurances by level-headed ministers that Parliament would block a no-deal exit are constitutionally questionable. The public, meanwhile, are worryingly relaxed about no deal. Polls find that many voters would rather do a runner from the EU than accept the compromise that Mrs May has struck.\n\nThe reality is that no deal amounts to a very bad deal, as our briefing this week spells out. It would rip up 45 years of arrangements with the continent that in living memory has gone from existential threat to vital ally. It would swap membership of the EU \u2019s single market for the most bare-bones trading relationship possible. Reneging on \u00a339bn ($50bn) in obligations to the EU would devastate Britain\u2019s international credibility. Reaching no deal on the Irish border would test the Good Friday Agreement that ended a serious armed conflict. And the violent dislocation of nearly every legal arrangement between Britain and Europe would affect daily life like nothing outside wartime.\n\nThe myth has taken hold that no deal simply means no trade deal. Proponents of a no-deal exit say it will involve Britain trading with the EU on the standard terms used by other members of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ). No-dealers argue, correctly, that Britain could eventually adjust to this. It would be painful, but the economy could move beyond industries like carmaking, which would be ruined by the 10% tariffs that the EU would impose on British exports. Consumers would gain if the government took the highly unlikely step of abolishing all tariffs, as no-dealer economists recommend. But protected sectors, particularly agriculture, would wither. And many Leave-voters might be surprised that the price of exit was the collapse of much of Britain\u2019s high-end manufacturing and the demise of farming.\n\nMore important, no deal would mean not just no trade deal, but the rupture of a whole corpus of legal arrangements with the EU . Britain would be left without rules to govern the trade in radioactive materials, international electricity markets, financial-contract clearing, aviation, medicines regulation, immigration control and much else. What some Brexiteers describe as a \u201cclean break\u201d from Europe would in fact be horrifically messy.\n\nNo-deal proponents counter that Britain and the EU would quickly sign side-deals to mitigate the worst of the chaos\u2014allowing flights to carry stranded citizens home, for instance. But it is unlikely that the EU would do more than the minimum if Britain defaults on its debts. What little goodwill remains would turn to dust. Brexiteers say that shortages could be avoided if Britain threw its borders open to EU products without checks. But eschewing any sort of regulation would be an odd way for Britain to \u201ctake back control\u201d, as the Leave campaign promised.\n\nIf Mrs May wonders how this dire outcome has come to be more popular than her hard-won deal, she should start by re-reading her own speeches. Her mantra that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d was supposed to persuade the EU to give Britain better terms. It didn\u2019t work. But it struck a chord at home. David Davis, her first Brexit secretary, compared the talks to buying a house: \u201cYou don\u2019t walk in and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to buy the house, now what\u2019s the price?\u2019 So why should it be any different in a big negotiation like this?\u201d The answer is that not buying a house means sticking with the status quo, whereas not signing a Brexit deal means swapping the status quo for a new, very bad alternative. The house-buying analogy works only if the buyer has burned down their existing home and is negotiating to buy the only one on the market.\n\nAdvocates of no deal brim with the same misplaced confidence with which they approached the Brexit talks. The grim warnings of what would happen after the referendum have turned out to be overblown, they point out. Britain has not fallen into recession, as Remainers forecast, though its performance relative to other advanced economies has declined. Might the impact of no deal turn out to be less bad than feared?\n\nPerhaps. But the disruption caused by an unmediated exit would be far more dramatic than the economic harm caused by the Brexit vote. The public cannot easily see what they have lost as a result of Britain\u2019s slip from being the fastest-growing member of the G 7 to one of the slowest. A no-deal Brexit, by contrast, could have highly visible effects. Essentials drying up, travellers stranded, motorways gridlocked: these things bring down governments and undermine faith in democratic politics. In 2000 Tony Blair\u2019s administration was plunged into crisis when protesting lorry-drivers blockaded oil refineries. The protests lasted barely a week but still forced supermarkets to ration bread and milk, and the government to deploy army ambulances."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Why suicide is falling around the world, and how to bring it down more", "description": "Urbanisation, fewer forced marriages and more curbs on the means of self-destruction", "url": "https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/11/24/why-suicide-is-falling-around-the-world-and-how-to-bring-it-down-more", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_LDD002_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T12:57:29Z", "content": "Y OU KNOW, says a trader in Margin Call, a film about the crash of 2008, as he stands high on a building above Wall Street, the feeling that people experience when they stand on the edge like this isnt the fear of fallingits the fear that they might jump.

It is at once appalling and yet, in the darkest places in our minds, appealing. It is the most damaging sort of death. A child\u2019s suicide is a parent\u2019s worst nightmare, and a parent\u2019s marks their children for life. It is a manifestation not just of individual anguish but also of a collective failure: if society is too painful to live in, perhaps we are all culpable.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe suicide rate in America is up by 18% since 2000. This is not merely a tragedy; it matters politically, too. The rise is largely among white, middle-aged, poorly educated men in areas that were left behind by booms and crushed by busts. Their deaths are a symptom of troubles to which some see President Donald Trump as the answer. Those troubles should not be ignored.\n\nNonetheless, beyond America\u2019s gloomy trend is a more optimistic story: that at a global level, suicide is down by 29% since 2000 (see article). As a result, 2.8m lives have been saved in that time\u2014three times as many as have been killed in battle. There is no one reason. It is happening at different rates among different groups in different places. But the decline is particularly notable among three sets of people.\n\nOne is young women in China and India. In most of the world, older people kill themselves more often than the young, and men more than women. But in China and India, young women have been unusually prone to suicide. That is decreasingly the case. Another group is middle-aged men in Russia. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, alcoholism and suicide rocketed among them. Both have now receded. A third category is old people all around the world. The suicide rate among the elderly remains, on average, higher than among the rest of the population, but has also fallen faster since 2000 than among other groups.\n\nWhy are these people now less likely to take their own lives? Urbanisation and greater freedom have helped. Accounts of those who attempt suicide, and of the relatives of those who succeed, suggest that many young Asian women were driven to despair by violent husbands and overbearing in-laws. As people move to cities and the grip of tradition loosens, women have more choice about whom they marry or live with, making life more bearable. Leaving the village helps in another way, too. Because farming involves killing things, rural folk are likelier to have the means to kill themselves\u2014guns, pesticides\u2014to hand.\n\nSocial stability is also a factor. In the turbulence that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, many middle-aged people saw their sources of income and status collapse. Unemployed people kill themselves at around two-and-a-half times the rate of those in work. The financial crash of 2007-08 and the resulting recessions are reckoned to have caused an extra 10,000 or so suicides in America and western Europe. As crises recede and employment rises, so suicide tends to ebb. And falling poverty rates among the old, which have declined faster than among other groups globally, are reckoned to have contributed to the drop in the number of elderly suicides.\n\nBut the decline is not just the consequence of big social trends. Policy plays a role, too. When Mikhail Gorbachev restricted the production and distribution of booze in the mid-1980s, both drinking and suicide fell sharply. The collapse of the Soviet Union swept those regulations aside, and both drinking and suicide shot up again. Restrictions introduced by Vladimir Putin in 2005 are reckoned to have contributed to the recent decline.\n\nGovernments can also help limit the consequences of social and economic turbulence. Active labour-market policies, which help re-train jobless workers and ease them back into work, prevent many suicides. And spending on health services, especially those that most benefit the old and sick, can make a big difference: fear of chronic pain is one of the things that leads people to seek a quick way out. The remarkable recent fall in suicide among elderly Britons may have happened in part because Britain\u2019s palliative-care system is the best in the world.\n\nEfforts to curb access to the means to kill oneself can help, too. Suicide is surprisingly impulsive. A study of young Chinese women who had tried to kill themselves showed that three-fifths had been contemplating suicide for less than two hours, and one in ten for less than a minute. Of 515 people who had survived the leap from San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate bridge between 1937 and 1971, 94% were still alive in 1978\u2014which suggests that a suicide postponed is likely to be a suicide prevented.\n\nGovernments can do a lot to put self-slaughter a little further out of reach. The most toxic pesticides account for one-seventh of suicides. When South Korea outlawed paraquat in 2011, it saw a decline in suicides but no drop in agricultural output. Requiring potentially lethal medicines to be sold only in small quantities, as some countries have done with aspirin and paracetamol, has also been shown to help. But the most effective measure of all is limiting access to guns. Half of all Americans who commit suicide shoot themselves, and the overall rate in America is about twice that in Britain, which has strict gun controls. The difference in gun ownership largely accounts for the state-by-state variation in suicide rates.\n\nThe media can also do their bit. Suicide is strangely contagious. When Robin Williams, an actor, killed himself in 2014, his method and motives were reported in great detail. Researchers calculated that there were 1,800 more suicides than would otherwise have been expected in the next four months, often using the same method. Journalists should cover such tragedies in less detail, and with more restraint.\n\nFor a few people\u2014those who are terminally ill, in severe pain and determined to die\u2014suicide may be the least terrible option. In such circumstances, and with firm safeguards, doctors should be allowed to assist. But many of the 800,000 people who kill themselves each year act in haste, and more could be saved with better health services, labour-market policies and curbs on booze, guns, pesticide and pills. America, in particular, could spare much pain by learning from the progress elsewhere."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "The first journey of an aircraft with an ion drive", "description": "How to fly silently, and without any moving parts", "url": "https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/11/24/the-first-journey-of-an-aircraft-with-an-ion-drive", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_STP004.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T12:55:02Z", "content": "I T IS NOT unusual for technologies from science fiction to join the real world, with examples ranging from video phones, via artificial intelligence, to self-driving cars.

Real ion drives now reposition satellites and send space probes on interplanetary journeys. Surprisingly, according to a paper published this week in Nature, they may have an earthly role, too. For the first time an aeroplane has flown powered by an ion drive.\n\nThe reason for surprise is that an ion drive delivers only a tiny amount of thrust. This does not matter in the vacuum of space, because without friction to hold a spacecraft back, speed builds up gradually to a decent rate. On Earth, however, it had long been assumed that the atmosphere is too dense for an aircraft using an ion drive to get off the ground.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be fair, the five-metre-wingspan model aircraft that Steven Barrett and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) flew with an ion drive was launched with the aid of a bungee. Nevertheless, in a series of ten test flights (a time-lapse picture of one of which is shown above) it successfully traversed a 60-metre indoor sports track. This distance is comparable to that of the first flight, in 1903, of the powered heavier-than-air plane built by the Wright brothers\u2014although theirs had a 12.3 metre wingspan and had also to carry the weight of a pilot.\n\nUnlike the Wright Flyer, and all powered aircraft since, the use of an ion drive means the MIT craft contains no moving propulsion parts in the form of propellers or jet engines. It can fly silently and without direct emissions from burning fossil fuels. It works by using electrodes to ionise a gas in such a way that the resulting ions (charged particles) create thrust. In space, the gas to be ionised, usually xenon, has to be carried by the craft. The MIT aircraft, however, ionises nitrogen from the air.\n\nThe ion drive itself consists of strips of parallel electrodes suspended in a rack below the craft\u2019s wing. These electrodes are powered by a pack of lithium-ion batteries. The nitrogen ions generated interact with neutral molecules in the air to form what is known as an ionic wind. The direction of this wind depends on the arrangement of the electrodes. In Dr Barrett\u2019s design, the wind is directed backward, meaning that Newton\u2019s third law of motion (to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction) carries the craft forward\u2014and, crucially, does so at a speed sufficient for its wings to provide lift.\n\nScaling the design up will, admittedly, be tricky. Though the level of thrust generated is sufficient to fly Dr Barrett\u2019s 2.5kg prototype, it is less than 1% of what would be required to keep an airliner airborne. There are, though, other sorts of aircraft which, with further development, ion drives might power. The MIT team reckon these include unmanned drones and high-altitude research craft.\n\nSuch devices might be built in entirely new ways. Although the test model used a conventional tail plane to provide stability and steering, Dr Barrett thinks future designs could do without it. Instead, the electrodes would shape the ionising electric fields in different ways, to control the direction of flight. Moreover, he adds, it might be possible to incorporate the electrodes into the skin of the aircraft so that there appears to be no distinctive power system. One day, this could result in something that looks a bit like a saucer, which could hover silently or zip through the air. Then another piece of science fiction would become science fact."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Suicide is declining almost everywhere", "description": "Thank urbanisation, greater freedom and some helpful policies", "url": "https://www.economist.com/international/2018/11/24/suicide-is-declining-almost-everywhere", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181124_IRD001_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T12:54:59Z", "content": "Z OZH IS A Russian neologism, born of an acronym for a healthy lifestyle.

It is part of a social transformation that has helped banish Russia\u2019s demons. As exercise and smoothies have replaced despair and alcohol, the suicide rate in Russia has crashed. And this trend is not unique to Russia (see chart).\n\nGlobally, the rate has fallen by 38% from its peak in 1994. As a result, over 4m lives have been saved\u2014more than four times as many people as were killed in combat over the period. The decline has happened at different rates and different times in different parts of the world. In the West, it started long ago: in Britain, for instance, the male rate peaked at around 30 per 100,000 a year in 1905, and again at the same level in 1934, during the Great Depression; among women it peaked at 12 in 1964. In most of the West, it has been flat or falling for the past two decades.\n\nIn other parts of the world, rates have dropped more recently. China\u2019s started to come down in the 1990s and declined steadily, flattening out in recent years. Russia\u2019s, Japan\u2019s, South Korea\u2019s and India\u2019s rates, still high, have all fallen.\n\nAmerica is the big exception. Until the turn of the century the rate there dropped along with those in other rich countries. But since then, it has risen by 18% to 12.8\u2014well above China\u2019s current rate of seven. The declines in those other big countries, however, far outweigh the rise in America.\n\nAlthough America\u2019s numbers are probably reliable, there is reason to treat some of these data with caution. Some countries where powerful religions forbid suicide have historically underreported the act; some still do so. For example, a recent study in Iran of attempted suicides came up with a rate ten times higher than the health ministry\u2019s figure. But the trends are probably broadly correct. Experts mostly reckon data are getting better rather than worse, which (given past underreporting) would tend to push rates up rather than down, yet the opposite is happening. Why?\n\nHalf the sky\n\nOne big reason seems to be an improvement in the lot of Asian women. In most countries, men are more likely to kill themselves than women, and older people more than younger ones. But in both China and India the suicide rate among young women has long been unusually high.\n\nThat has changed. Among Chinese women in their 20s, the rate has dropped by nine-tenths since the mid-1990s; that group accounts for around half a million of those 4m lives saved.\n\nGreater social freedom is one of the reasons, suggests Jing Jun, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing: \u201cFemale independence has saved a lot of women.\u201d In a study in 2002 looking at high rates among young rural women, two-thirds who attempted suicide cited unhappy marriages, two-fifths said they were beaten by their spouses and a third complained of conflict with their mothers-in-law. Professor Jing explains: \u201cThey married into their husbands\u2019 families; they\u2019d leave their home town; they\u2019d go to a place where they knew nobody.\u201d These days, scarcity may enhance the value and power of rural women: in Chinese villages, among 30- to 34-year-olds, there are three unmarried men for every unmarried woman.\n\nThere may be something similar going on in India. \u201cYoung women face particularly challenging gender norms in India,\u201d says Vikram Patel of the Harvard Medical School. If parents disapprove of a relationship, they will tell the police their daughter has been abducted. The cops will then take a 21-year-old away from a consensual relationship. So, he concludes, many suicides in India \u201care related to the lack of agency for young people to choose their own romantic partners\u201d. As social mores have liberalised, that is changing. Rates among young women have fallen faster than among any other group since 1990; Mr Patel believes they will continue to improve as social liberalisation continues.\n\nUrbanisation has probably helped in both China and India. That seems counter-intuitive since it is associated with the weakening of the social bonds which, according to Emile Durkheim, a 19th-century sociologist and theorist of suicide, helped protect people against suicidal urges. Yet all over the world, suicide rates tend to be higher in rural areas than in urban ones. Social bonds sometimes constrain people as well as sustaining them; escaping an abusive husband or tyrannical mother-in-law is easier in a city than in a village. And the means to kill oneself are harder to come by in a town than in the countryside.\n\nWhile the demographic oddity in China and India was the high rate among young women, that in Russia was the high rate among middle-aged men. They, it seemed, were the victims of the huge social dislocation that happened after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The period is brought to life by \u201cSecond-Hand Time\u201d, an oral history by Svetlana Alexievich, a Nobel-prizewinning author, notable for a bleak pattern: its characters keep killing themselves.\n\nWorn down by hunger and poverty, one man set himself on fire in his vegetable patch. An ageing veteran survived the second world war, only to throw himself under a train in 1992. An officer who took part in the attempted coup against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 later hanged himself in the Kremlin. \u201cEverything I heretofore considered to be the meaning of my life is being destroyed,\u201d he wrote in a suicide note.\n\nHyperinflation, falling incomes and rampant unemployment in the first years of transition left many facing misery and want. The 1998 financial crisis, when the Russian government defaulted on its debts, wiped out many families\u2019 savings. Since the early 2000s, however, the trends have been reversing. Russia\u2019s suicide rate now sits at 25\u2014very high by global standards, but down by half from its peak. The decline has happened disproportionately among middle-aged men, the group that suffered most in the 1990s.\n\nA big reason is probably that society is settling down after the upheaval of the post-Soviet era. According to Olga Kalashnikova, a psychologist at the suicide and crisis-psychiatry department of Moscow City Hospital No 20, \u201cNow people know how to get by, and how to get by without the state.\u201d Since 2000 GDP per head has nearly doubled. Wages recovered their losses from the 1990s and more. Unemployment is below 5%. Relatively high current levels of suicide among males in rural areas, which tend to be less well-off, reinforce the socioeconomic hypothesis. Ilnur Aminov, a demographer, points out that nearly 40% of all suicides in his home region of Bashkiria are by unemployed people.\n\nThere are parallels between the rise in suicide in post-Soviet Russia and the \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d in America identified by Anne Case and Sir Angus Deaton, economists at Princeton University. Suicide rates among white Americans are higher, and have risen faster since 2000, than among any other group except native Americans (see chart). The same trend can be seen among the middle-aged. At the turn of the century, older people were much more likely to kill themselves than those in their 50s, but that is no longer true. Rates among people in rural areas are higher, and have been increasing faster, than those among people in towns and cities.\n\nIt is hard to conclude that the explanation is a simple economic one of stagnating median incomes and falling employment rates. Blacks and Hispanics have faced similar economic problems to whites, and employment rates among the young tend to be lower than those among the middle-aged. Ms Case and Sir Angus put it down to \u201cfamiliar stories about globalisation and automation, changes in social customs that have allowed dysfunctional changes in patterns of marriage and child-rearing, the decline of unions, and others. Ultimately, we see our story as about the collapse of the white working class after its heyday in the early 1970s, and the pathologies that accompany this decline.\u201d\n\nThe increase in the American suicide rate predated the economic crash, but accelerated in the recession that followed it. Research suggests that, after the global economic crisis, an uptick in suicide rates in Europe, America and Canada led to 10,000 more deaths between 2007 and 2010. Debt, foreclosure and unemployment are all implicated in suicide: unemployed people kill themselves at a rate 2.5 times higher than those in work. A spike of suicides in South Korea followed the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.\n\nPolicy can mitigate the effects of recession. According to research by David Stuckler of Bocconi University in Milan, Sweden saw no increase in suicide in either its recession of 1991-92 or after 2007. Mr Stuckler attributes this in part to better health services\u2014unemployment is less daunting where health care is available to all than in countries such as America where it is linked to employment\u2014and government efforts to get people back into the workplace. A study of 26 European countries showed suicide rates to be inversely correlated with spending on active labour-market policies. Japan\u2019s suicide-watchers attribute the decline there in part to the success of Abenomics in bringing down unemployment. Michiko Ueda of Waseda University thinks the economy is the \u201cnumber one reason\u201d for the decline in suicide.\n\nAlso clearly linked to suicide is alcohol\u2014at least in \u201cdry drinking\u201d cultures, such as Russia, eastern Europe and Scandinavia, where people drink to get drunk, though not in \u201cwet drinking\u201d places such as southern and central Europe, where people drink socially over a meal. In Russia, drinking and suicide have risen and fallen in tandem. Alcohol consumption halved between 2003 and 2016; by then, Russians were drinking less per head than French or Germans. As Russians adopt healthier lifestyles, beer\u2019s share of the market has been rising and that of spirits falling.\n\nSuicide and drinking do seem to go together\u2014but both might be the effect of social turbulence. Evidence from before the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, suggests that, to some extent at least, alcohol leads to suicide. In 1985 Mr Gorbachev imposed tough regulations on the production and distribution of alcohol. Vodka sales fell by half between 1984 and 1986. Over that period, the male suicide rate dropped by 41% and the female rate by 24%. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the state\u2019s alcohol monopoly was abolished and the regulations were ripped up. Alcohol consumption and suicide both soared.\n\nState intervention is probably in part responsible for the recent fall in suicide, too. In 2006 new rules on alcohol production and distribution pushed up prices. Statistical analysis suggests that those restrictions led to a 9% decline in male suicide, which saved 4,000 lives a year; a similar policy in Slovenia in 2003 led to a 10% decline.\n\nImprovements in the lives of the elderly are also believed to have helped bring down suicide rates. Globally, the rate among the old has tended to be higher than among the young and middle-aged, but in most places it has also fallen faster.\n\nOne reason may be that, as Diego de Leo, former head of the Australian Institute for Suicide Prevention and Research, points out, across the world poverty rates among the old (often the poorest group in society) have been declining faster than those among other groups. Better health services, used by the old more than the young, may be another reason. Long-term sickness is a common reason for suicide, and efforts to ease patients\u2019 pain can make a big difference. Britain\u2019s palliative-care system, regarded as the best in the world, helps explain a remarkable fall in the suicide rate among old people.\n\nHome care, too, can cheer up the elderly. Mr de Leo points to the influx of badanti, migrant care workers, in Italy. Italian children are reluctant to consign their parents to old people\u2019s homes, but also often have neither the time nor the inclination to look after the elderly themselves. Migrant workers, says Professor de Leo, have brought \u201ca massive improvement\u201d. (Too much so, grumble some middle-aged Italians, aghast at their aged parents\u2019 hooking up with supposedly gold-digging migrants.)\n\nTsinghua University\u2019s Jing Jun believes that China also needs to focus on reducing suicides among the old. He blames the Chinese tradition of responsibility for parental care. With the one-child policy, there are too few children to bear the burden, and if there is more than one, parents may find themselves causing conflict. \u201cIn the West, your children are bickering only about the time they\u2019re spending with you. In China they\u2019re fighting over the money they\u2019re spending on you.\u201d But he says things are moving in the right direction: rates among the old have come down as pension and health-care provision have improved.\n\nRestricting access to the means to kill oneself can also make a big difference. Suicide is a surprisingly impulsive act, especially among the young. According to that 2002 study of young Chinese women who had tried to kill themselves, three-fifths had been thinking of suicide for two hours or less, including two-fifths who had been thinking of it for ten minutes or less, and one in ten for just a minute. Reaching for the rat-poison\u201488% of them had used agricultural pesticides\u2014is likely to lead to many more deaths than, say, grabbing a bottle of pills. That may help explain why the decline in rates among Chinese women has been sharper than among men. In urban areas, men favour violent means such as hanging or jumping off buildings, whereas women tend to favour medication, which is less likely to kill them. So moving away from rural areas tends to save more women than men.\n\nBetter never than late\n\nPeople tend to believe that those who intend to kill themselves are very likely to end up doing so. In a survey carried out by Matthew Miller of Northeastern University, 34% of respondents thought that all or most of those who jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge would have found another way of killing themselves if a barrier had stopped them; a further 40% thought most would have. But a study of 515 people who had survived the leap between 1937 and 1971 showed that 94% were still alive when the study was carried out in 1978, which suggests that suicide is often a fleeting impulse rather than a settled intention.\n\nBritain in the 1960s offers a sharp illustration of what can happen if access to an easy means of killing oneself is foreclosed. When the country switched from toxic coal gas\u2014the favoured means of suicide among women and elderly men\u2014to harmless North Sea gas, rates among those groups crashed. At the time, rates were rising among young men, lending support to the idea that the gas switch played a role.\n\nThat was the fortuitous consequence of an energy find, but deliberate policy can play a role in restricting access to the means of suicide. A series of bans in Sri Lanka\u2014most recently of paraquat, in 2008-11\u2014helped bring the rate down from 45 in the early 1990s to 20 now. When South Korea banned paraquat in 2011, the reduction in suicide deaths is reckoned to have contributed half of the overall decline in suicides over the next two years. Paraquat is now banned in the EU ; China has said it will ban it; distribution is restricted in America; but in many parts of the world it remains freely available.\n\nIn western Europe, where pesticides are no longer a serious risk, the focus has been on limiting access to dangerous pills. In Britain, for instance, a law was passed in 1998 to limit the number of aspirin and paracetamol that could be sold in a single pack. In the following year, aspirin suicides were down by 46% and paracetamol ones by 22%. Blister packs help, too, because pills must be pushed out tediously one by one, allowing a would-be suicide time to reconsider. In America, alas, paracetamol is still sold loose in bottles, so 50 pills can be chugged in one go.\n\nBut the main means of suicide in America is guns. They account for half of suicides, and suicides account for more firearms deaths than homicides do. Guns are more efficient than pills, so people who impulsively shoot themselves are more likely to end up in the morgue than in the emergency ward. According to Matthew Miller of Harvard University, gun-ownership levels largely explain the variation in suicide rates, which range from 26 per 100,000 in Montana to five in Washington, DC . If America gave up its guns, suicides would crash.\n\nSelf-restraint on the part of the media can also play a role. Even in death, people are influenced by celebrities. This is known as the \u201cWerther effect\u201d, after the rash of suicides that followed the publication in 1774 of a novel by Goethe which ends with the eponymous hero\u2019s suicide. Particularly common in Asia, the phenomenon has been observed all over the world. After Robin Williams, an American comedian, hanged himself in 2014, researchers calculated that there were 1,841 more suicides\u2014a 10% increase\u2014than would have been expected during the next four months. The rise in hangings, and among the middle-aged, was particularly marked.\n\nSuicide experts criticised the sheriff of Marin County for describing in detail the method that Williams had used. Reporting clearly makes a difference. Paul Yip of Hong Kong University points to trends in the territory after a front-page story in 1998 on the suicide of a woman who had killed herself by sealing up a room and burning charcoal, thus poisoning herself with carbon monoxide. Within a year, charcoal-burner suicides had gone from zero to 10% of the total. When Ahn Jae-hwan, a South Korean actor, killed himself in his car with a charcoal-burner in 2008, the method went from less than 1% of South Korean suicides to 8% in 2011, accounting for most of the overall rise in the rate in that period.\n\nMany countries have media guidelines, which basically say the same things: don\u2019t write about suicides in a heroic light and don\u2019t report the location or method in detail. Media restraint seems to make a difference. After a spate of suicides on the underground in Vienna, when people were killing themselves at a rate of nine every six months, newspapers were persuaded to stop reporting suicides or at least to keep them off the front page. Numbers went down to one to four every six months. But in some countries media guidelines are widely ignored. A study of South Korean suicide-reporting earlier this year showed that three-quarters of articles gave details of method and location, and half revealed the contents of the dead person\u2019s suicide note. Readers\u2019 prurient fascination with the gory details of suicide trumps responsible journalism.\n\nFaced with the horror of a suicidal friend or relation, people feel scared and impotent. Yet just as individuals can make a difference\u2014talking, listening, helping people through a difficult time\u2014so can societies. Giving women more control over their lives, cushioning the impacts of social change, providing better care for the elderly, restraining the way that suicide is reported, restricting access to the means of killing oneself: all these things can make life a little more worth living, or at least persuade the desperate to hold onto it until it seems that way."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Why the internet is obsessed with cyst-popping videos", "description": "Think of them as part of a grooming ritual", "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/11/21/why-the-internet-is-obsessed-with-cyst-popping-videos", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20181124_BLP505.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T11:45:56Z", "content": "I NEVER THOUGHT Id be lucky enough to pop one of these myself reads the title of a video uploaded to Reddit.

When animals pick scabs and vegetation off each other\u2019s fur they are undertaking an exercise in intimacy, as well as hygiene. Pimple-popping may simply be a human variation of this. Scholarship on the topic is rare, though, and there are several other theories about the videos\u2019 popularity.

ASMR has not been widely researched\u2014its very existence is not universally accepted\u2014but some of those who claim to have experienced it have highlighted triggers that include receiving close attention from another person and watching someone diligently complete a task. Other explanations are simpler. People may just enjoy seeing a nasty problem (whether it is an ingrown toenail or a build-up of earwax) dealt with effectively. They may find it thrilling.

First Lisbeth was played by Noomi Rapace in a Swedish film of \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\u201d (2009) and its two made-for-TV sequels, which used up all the source material from the \u201cMillennium\u201d novels written by Stieg Larsson before his death in 2004. Then she was played by Rooney Mara in a Hollywood adaptation of \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\u201d (2011), directed by David Fincher. And now the hacker, avenger and gothic fashion icon is back in \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web\u201d, which is based on one of the two authorised \u201cMillennium\u201d novels by David Lagercrantz, the series\u2019 new author.\n\nMs Foy (Queen Elizabeth in \u201cThe Crown\u201d) is at least the equal of her predecessors. With an impressive Swedish accent, as well as the boyish haircut of a medieval monk, she brings a surprising air of pain and anguish to a character who often has the sullen toughness of the Terminator. Sadly, the film around her is less convincing. Mr Larsson\u2019s bestselling thrillers, as pulpy as they were, exposed the dark side of Stockholm society: its violence, its ingrained misogyny, its undercurrent of Nazi white supremacism (a topic which seemed a lot less resonant when the first \u201cDragon Tattoo\u201d came out than it does today). But \u201cThe Girl in The Spider\u2019s Web\u201d is little more than a calculated attempt to establish a long-running action franchise with a woman\u2014or a \u201cGirl\u201d\u2014in the lead role.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by Fede Alvarez (\u201cDon\u2019t Breathe\u201d), the film has its share of Scandi-noir motifs, from the dour colour scheme to the snowy evergreens, and it retains some of the novels\u2019 kinkiness: at one point Lisbeth is vacuum-packed in black latex. But these elements are all that distinguish it from any other slick but gloomy James Bond knock-off.\n\nAfter an early sequence in which Lisbeth blackmails a wife-beating CEO, the film leaps into blockbuster territory. Its heroine is employed by a scientist named Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant, who, as ever, sticks with his West Country accent) to steal a computer program he wrote for the American government. Complete with its own catchy, Bond-ish codename, \u201cFirefall\u201d, the program allows its user to take control of the world\u2019s nuclear arsenals. Balder has decided, belatedly, that maybe it wasn\u2019t such a great idea to let one government have it.\n\nSalander carries out this cyber-theft in no time, even though the mission was \u201cimpossible\u201d. But before she can hand a laptop containing the program to Balder\u2014why not just erase it?\u2014a group of masked thugs breaks into her spartan warehouse apartment and sets off a bomb. Her decor was so minimalist that the apartment looks much the same after the explosion as it did beforehand, but Salander is determined to investigate, and so she contacts her journalist sidekick, Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason, taking over the role played in the last film by 007 himself, Daniel Craig).\n\nBlomkvist identifies the thugs as members of a crime syndicate called The Spiders, but they aren\u2019t the only people interested in Firefall. Also on the case is an American secret agent, played by Lakeith Stanfield, who has little narrative purpose except to make the generic goodies-vs-baddies plot seem more intricate and international than it really is. And, as the trailer gives away the film\u2019s main twist, it is no spoiler to say that the boss of the Spiders is none other than Lisbeth\u2019s own psychotic sister Camilla, played by Sylvia Hoeks.\n\nCamilla is as blonde as Lisbeth is dark, so when these two Swedish characters are in the same scene you can have the pleasure of pretending you are watching an ABBA biopic instead. But Camilla, a megalomaniac in a bright red outfit, is as far over-the-top as any Bond villain. Indeed, the last Bond movie, \u201cSpectre\u201d, declared that 007\u2019s arch-enemy, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, was really his foster brother, so \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web\u201d is hardly breaking new ground by mixing petty sibling rivalry with global-domination conspiracies.\n\nThe super-spy nonsense outweighs any socio-political themes. Mr Alvarez stages regular preposterous action set-pieces which demonstrate that Salander has both the physical capabilities of Jason Bourne and the genius of Sherlock Holmes. She was once a punky computer nerd with a kickboxing hobby\u2014now she wrestles an assassin twice her size and zooms across a frozen lake on a Ducati motorbike.\n\nThese sequences are efficiently assembled, if never exactly exciting, and it may seem churlish to complain when there are so few female heroines in blockbusters. But \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web\u201d is pulling so hard in two opposing directions that it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. It is trying to be both a goofy popcorn movie about a superheroine and a moody drama about an abuse survivor, and the results are too sombre to laugh along with yet too daft to take seriously. The question now is whether a sequel can find a more expedient tone, or whether there will be another reboot and another Lisbeth in a few years\u2019 time."}, {"source": {"id": "the-economist", "name": "The Economist"}, "author": null, "title": "Economic data, commodities and markets", "description": null, "url": "https://www.economist.com/economic-and-financial-indicators/2018/11/24/economic-data-commodities-and-markets", "urlToImage": "/assets/the-economist-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T09:33:20Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Join them.

So it is with disquiet that China is watching Taiwan\u2019s preparations to hold several referendums on November 24th, at the same time as local elections. Among a wide array of questions that will be put to voters, on matters ranging from LGBT rights to nuclear power, is one that is particularly worrisome to officials in Beijing. It asks whether the country should participate in the next Olympic games, in Tokyo in 2020, as well as other international sporting events, under the name \u201cTaiwan\u201d.\n\nFor China\u2019s Communist Party, victory for the yes campaign would be truly galling. In deference to the party\u2019s sensitivities, the International Olympic Committee only allows Taiwan\u2019s athletes to call their team \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d.

In the party\u2019s view, the ROC has been replaced by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and so it no longer exists. When the term was introduced in 1984, Chinese Taipei was just about acceptable to both sides, since the word \u201cChinese\u201d did not make clear whether the Chinese-ness was that of the ROC or the PRC.

The island held its first referendum in 2004, on how to handle relations with China. In 2008 voters were asked whether Taiwan should join the UN under the name Taiwan. But those and other referendums failed to pass owing to a high threshold for voter turnout. Last December Taiwan\u2019s current, independence-leaning, government lowered the bar. The Olympic-name referendum has a much better chance of delivering a valid result. It could well be yes.\n\nThe president, Tsai Ing-wen, would doubtless be delighted if Taiwan could be called just that by everyone, not only the IOC. But China has made it clear that changing the island\u2019s official name from ROC to Taiwan would be construed as a declaration of independence (ROC may be bad in China\u2019s view, but at least the name has got that all-important C in it). Ms Tsai does not want war. The revised referendum law specifically bans plebiscites on independence. The president is not even pushing for a change of name at the Olympics. She likely reckons it would be a waste of time. China has said that an attempt to do so could result in the disqualification of Taiwan\u2019s team. On November 16th the IOC issued a similar warning.\n\nIt was not the government that proposed the referendum, but a grassroots movement called the Team Taiwan Campaign led by a famous Taiwanese track-and-field athlete and Olympic medallist, Chi Cheng. Supporters of the cause know that they have little chance of persuading the IOC. If the referendum passes, the government will be legally obliged to take up the name-change cause. But it may not be able to persuade Taiwan\u2019s own Olympic committee, which is a private entity and does not have to follow the government\u2019s orders on such matters.\n\nEven though a yes result would be highly unlikely to result in a new name for Taiwan\u2019s team, supporters of the campaign want to use the issue to make a point to China. Cross-strait relations are not a big topic in the upcoming local elections, so the referendum will be a chance for voters to show what they think of China\u2019s growing military and diplomatic pressure on the island. \u201cWe want the whole world to know we are Taiwan,\u201d says an organiser. \u201cWe will try again, and again, and again.\u201d"}]
