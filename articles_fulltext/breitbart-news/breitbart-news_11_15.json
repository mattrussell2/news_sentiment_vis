Consider that such proceedings, conducted under the Institutional Hearing Program, are dependent on the availability of immigration judges, plus the time and money to send them on such details. To be cost-effective for BOP, for the judges, and for Homeland Security agents, this means lining up a host of such hearings at a single time. Thus, Institutional Hearing Program (IHP) proceedings may only take place every several months. The language also doesn\u2019t take into account that an alien may seek judicial review of the immigration judge\u2019s order in a federal circuit court of appeal. Even if the appeal is frivolous, until it\u2019s disposed of, the removal order isn\u2019t final and the alien continues to accrue good time credits. [Emphasis added] Second, consider that the language prohibiting participation in time-reduction programs (which is admittedly technical) only applies to aliens who are being charged as removable for certain crimes. Ironically, those crimes don\u2019t include aliens in prison for some immigration offenses \u2014 such as individuals who have repeatedly reentered the United States after having been removed. What sense does it make to incentivize more future illegal reentries by reducing their sentences for participating in \u201crecidivism reduction\u201d programs when they\u2019ve already shown themselves to be recidivists and scofflaws? [Emphasis added]\n\nThe prison reform plan, as noted by Cadman, will also allow criminal illegal aliens to be placed in prisons that are within 500 miles of where they were illegally residing and allows deportable criminals to be considered as \u201clow risk\u201d so they can be allowed to stay in home confinement rather than finishing out their sentence in prison.\n\nAnother element of the First Step Act is to collect enormous amounts of data on the prison population. But, when it comes to collecting data on the criminal foreign prison population, the legislation only requires that the total prison headcount of criminal foreigners be tallied.\n\nQuestions regarding the criminal foreign population\u2019s age, gender, nationality, criminal offense, and immigration status would continue to go unanswered and unrecorded for the public.\n\nAmong the conservative beltway, there is a concerted effort to get Trump-supporting pundits and organizations on board with the First Step Act, despite concerns from the law enforcement community about the legislation.\n\nIn August, Cadman wrote that he had been notified by a Trump administration official who allegedly scolded him for criticizing the prison reform plan and asked him to stop:\n\nShortly after my analysis was published I experienced proof that there were White House pressures at work to move the bill forward: I myself received a phone call from a highly placed administration official who chided me for my irresponsible piece and assured me that some of what I perceived as flaws really only reflected the status quo (such as availability of prison reintegration programs for deportable illegal alien prisoners), and/or intimated that the other matters would be dealt with by amendments so I shouldn\u2019t worry. This official ended by suggesting that if I felt the need to write further on the bill, I should contact the official\u2019s office first. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe plan has been heralded by the New York Times editorial board as a bipartisan effort between the Republican establishment and the Democrats. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), has refused to back down on his opposition to the prison reform effort, despite attacks from his colleagues.\n\nNearly 95 percent of foreign nationals in federal prison are illegal aliens,while the Bureau of Prisons data has revealed that about 1-in-5 inmates are foreign-born. There are close to 40,000 criminal illegal and legal immigrants incarcerated in federal prisons across the country, making up about 21 percent of the total federal prison population. Nearly all of those inmates are from Central and South America, resulting in a cost to U.S. taxpayers of about $1.4 billion every year."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "John Carney, John Carney", "title": "The 'Trade Surrender Lobby' in Trump Administration Pushes for 'Truce' with China", "description": "Trump is being pushed to agree to a trade truce when he meets with Xi Jinping at the end of November.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/15/the-trade-surrender-lobby-in-trump-administration-pushes-for-truce-with-china/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/ap/01/76d291_china-economy-04343-donald-trump-xi-jinping-in-nov-2017-file-photo-chinese-e1542318488697.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:43:39Z", "content": "Both outside informal advisers to the president as well as high-ranking government officials have participated in a coordinated push to get President Donald Trump to back off his threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods from ten percent to 25 percent in the n\u2026 [+3486 chars]", "fulltext": "Efforts to get the Trump administration to soften its stance on China have intensified in recent weeks.\n\nBoth outside informal advisers to the president as well as high-ranking government officials have participated in a coordinated push to get President Donald Trump to back off his threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods from ten percent to 25 percent in the new year, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n\nPresident Trump spoke with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping by telephone on November 1. The two leaders agreed to discuss trade issues when they meet at the G-20 meeting in Argentina at the end of November.\n\nNo one inside or outside the administration believes the many areas of dispute between the U.S. and China can be resolved by then. But some inside the administration are hoping the talks will lead to a \u201ctruce\u201d between the two nations, with Trump agreeing not to escalate the tariffs while negotiations continue. Critics of this approach say it plays into China\u2019s strategy of talking endlessly without ever making substantive concessions.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that the White House National Economic Council, which is led by Larry Kudlow, was exploring options that could lead to a trade truce. Kudlow replaced former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn as head of the council, which was long a stronghold of internal opposition to the president\u2019s trade agenda. Cohn\u2013who Trump nicknamed \u201cGlobalist Gary\u201d\u2013left shortly after the tariffs on steel and aluminum were announced.\n\n\u201cIt is almost as if Xi Jinping wants to roll in there on his own at the G20 and see if they can\u2019t capture Trump in the meeting,\u201d one China policy expert told the Financial Times.\n\nLess than one week ago, White House trade chief Peter Navarro warned that Wall Street billionaires acting as unregistered foreign agents were pushing the president to cut a deal with China on Wall Street\u2019s terms. The Financial Times story, as well as another in the Washington Post, appear to vindicate Navarro\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cThe recent market turmoil, House election result and angst in farm states has the Trump team rattled on trade,\u201d one multinational executive told the Washington Post. \u201cThe president still wants to pull the trigger on crazy stuff like an autos tariff, but he\u2019s lost some of his swagger, and a lot of people around him are saying he needs to back away from extreme action.\u201d\n\nKudlow this week publicly rebuked Navarro, saying he was \u201cway off base\u201d with his remarks. Kudlow also said that talks with China had resumed after a long period in which the two nations had been largely out of touch on trade issues.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to them again,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cWe\u2019re having communications at all levels of the U.S. and Chinese government.\u201d\n\nThe possibility of a truce has riled some administration trade hawks, but no one was willing to speak on the record for fear of reprisals.\n\n\u201cThe second round of China tariffs just kicked in a month ago and these guys want to scream \u2018Uncle.\u2019 There is still a trade surrender lobby inside the administration,\u201d one Trump administration official said.\n\nThe Financial Times, citing a person familiar with the situation, reported that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had told some industry executives the next round of China tariffs was already on hold. Lighthizer\u2019s office has strongly denied that there has been any change of policy.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Lighthizer has made no representations to industry executives that future Section 301 tariffs are on hold. The plan for the tariffs as covered in the Federal Register Notice dated September 21, 2018, has not changed at all. Any reports to the contrary are incorrect,\u201d a spokesman for Lighthizer said.\n\nLighthizer has been known as a trade hawk and has been very critical of China\u2019s predatory practices. Lighthizer\u2019s spokesman pointed to his earlier comment when contacted by Brietbart News."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Allum Bokhari, Allum Bokhari", "title": "Bokhari: New York Times Buries Ledes, Magnifies Molehills in Facebook Investigation", "description": "There's buried gold in the New York Times' bonanza Facebook investigation, but readers must work to find it.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/11/15/bokhari-new-york-times-buries-ledes-magnifies-molehills-in-facebook-investigation/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/wi/ap/30/2b0922_earns-facebook-03462-mark-zuckerberg-file-in-may-2018-file-photo-facebook-e1541189551352.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:22:08Z", "content": "From the article: In July, as Facebooks troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, by then Facebooks most insistent inquisitor in Congress.

Back off, he told Mr. Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Mr. Schumer\u2019s intervention. Mr. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Mr. Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer\u2019s efforts to protect the company, according to the employee. A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Mr. Schumer had not wanted Mr. Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.\n\nA top politician urging an ostensibly neutral social media platform take sides politically by cracking down on the \u201cdisinformation\u201d of just one side sounds like a big story to me, but readers have to get through thousands of words before this is briefly mentioned. Schumer acting as the protector of Facebook within the Senate is also interesting: given that Facebook has indeed cracked down on the right \u2013 Schumer\u2019s political opponents, these details hint at a quid pro quo relationship between Schumer and the tech giant.\n\nOr it could simply be because Schumer\u2019s own daughter works at the company, as The Times notes. Regardless of the reason, the cosy relationship between the Senate Minority Leader and one of the most powerful tech companies on the planet should probably be a little higher up in the New York Times\u2019 piece.\n\nInstead of leading with this, the New York Times chose to focus its attention on Facebook\u2019s attempts to court the right and right-wing media. Ordinary, if problematic corporate behavior, like hiring ex-Republican staffers to assist in its conservative outreach is presented as major news. (The New York Times doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with the huge number of Obama and Hillary alumni working at the highest levels of the company.)\n\nThe article misrepresents Russian involvement on Facebook, saying it was intended to \u201chack and harass [Trump\u2019s] Democratic opponents.\u201d But this is a narrative that is contradicted by the evidence, which shows that the majority of Russian ads aimed to stoke racial tensions (with left-wing as well as right-wing content) rather than support particular candidates. The New York Times doesn\u2019t even acknowledge criticism of the narrative from Facebook\u2019s VP. Like most liberal outlets engaged in the Trump-Russia narrative, it also fails to mention that the research so far indicates the effect of fake news and propaganda online to be approximately zero.\n\nThe article also spends a great deal of time discussing the relationship between Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, one of the most contrived tech scandals of the year. The New York Times reporters describe the former company as \u201ca political data firm linked to President Trump,\u201d unwittingly revealing their own biases. We\u2019ve always known that Facebook shared masses of user data with third parties \u2014 there were reports about this as far back as 2010. We\u2019ve also known that this data can help presidential candidates get elected. Obama\u2019s former data chief Carol Davidsen has admitted that Facebook was \u201csurprised\u201d that the campaign gained access to the \u201centire social graph\u201d of the U.S., but nonetheless let them continue, even admitting to the campaign that they allowed the campaign to do things \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.\u201d\n\nDid Cambridge Analytica breach Facebook\u2019s rules? Yes, but the bigger story is that those rules didn\u2019t even exist before 2014, when everyone from the Obama campaign to the creators of Farmville preyed on user data. Davidsen\u2019s admission gets scant attention because it reveals why politicians and the mainstream media haven\u2019t panicked about Facebook\u2019s widely-known data collection practices earlier \u2014 it\u2019s because of Trump, not because of the data collection. Davidsen revealed that the Obama campaign was able to \u201cingest the entire social network of the U.S. that\u2019s on Facebook\u201d all the way back in 2015. This was a startling admission, revealing a data harvesting operation far more extensive than Cambridge Analytica\u2019s \u2014 and there was no scandal!\n\nIndeed, despite the fact that Facebook has since suspended 200 apps that may have misused users\u2019 personal data, the media still focuses relentlessly on Cambridge Analytica. It\u2019s a partisan trick, designed to pressure Facebook for allowing the Trump campaign to use its platform successfully in 2016, shrouded in the non-partisan issue of privacy. The icing on the cake? Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower hailed as a hero by the media founded his own data analysis company, Eunoia Technologies, where Wylie said he wanted to build \u201cthe NSA\u2019s wet dream.\u201d The Canadian Liberal Party awarded the same company a $100,000 contract. You\u2019re unlikely to find any of this information in most mainstream coverage of Facebook\u2019s data scandals, including this New York Times piece.\n\nThe Times also seems to think it\u2019s newsworthy that Facebook began an outreach campaign to Republicans and conservatives, facilitated by its hiring of the Silicon Valley breach of a public affairs firm headed by former Jeb Bush staffer (I will stretch the definition of \u201cconservative\u201d on the Times behalf here). This is normal, if problematic, behavior for a corporation, especially at a time when Republicans controlled all three branches of the federal government. The New York Times reports that Millers\u2019 firm, Definers Public Affairs, sought to defend Facebook\u2019s reputation to conservatives by tying its left-wing critics to George Soros. The mainstream media will surely see this as scandalous, but it\u2019s as much as a no-brainer as tying your right-wing opponents to the Koch brothers if your goal is to court the socialist left.\n\nIgnore the hype, and there are still eye-opening details in the Times\u2019 investigation. For example, the fact that Facebook reportedly backed new federal sex trafficking legislation called SESTA as a matter of political opportunism rather than concern for the victims. So much for Silicon Valley\u2019s much-vaunted \u201cvalues!\u201d\n\nGoogle and others had fought the bill for months, worrying it would set a cumbersome precedent. But the sex trafficking bill was championed by Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota who had pummeled Facebook over accusations that it censored conservative content, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and senior commerce committee member who was a frequent critic of Facebook. Facebook broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.\n\nAnother fascinating tidbit: Facebook CEO personally made inquiries about the possibility that Donald Trump may have breached the platform\u2019s terms of service while he was still a candidate.\n\nThen Donald J. Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d on Muslims entering the United States. Mr. Trump\u2019s call to arms \u2014 widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans \u2014 was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site\u2019s power to spread racist sentiment. Mr. Zuckerberg, who had helped found a nonprofit dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation. He asked Ms. Sandberg and other executives if Mr. Trump had violated Facebook\u2019s terms of service.\n\nAnother eye-opener: Facebook contacted the anti-defamation league (ADL) to frame left-wing protesters as anti-semitic after they displayed posters depicting Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg as an octopus encircling the globe. The ADL, which has partnered with Facebook and other tech giants to fight \u201ccyberhate,\u201d was happy to do its bidding in that instance.\n\nEddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online. That afternoon, the A.D.L. issued a warning from its Twitter account. \u201cDepicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,\u201d the organization wrote. \u201cProtest Facebook \u2014 or anyone \u2014 all you want, but pick a different image.\u201d The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \u201cextreme anti-Israel groups.\u201d\n\nThe key here is that a group that works with Facebook is also describing its political critics as anti-semitic. As Breitbart News editor-at-large Joel Pollak writes, the anti-defamation league should consider removing the word \u201canti\u201d from its name.\n\nThe New York Times is partisan left-wing media pretending to be neutral. Its coverage priorities reflect that, and there\u2019s plenty of spin in its writeup of this investigation. Like other partisan media though, it is also capable of unearthing valuable details about the tech companies that have come to dominate our society.

Maxine Waters is hosting a roundtable Thursday with members of Congress, civil rights advocates, and student leaders about the proposed rules.\n\nJoy Pullmann, executive editor at the Federalist, told Breitbart News the ideology behind the implementation of the Obama-era policies on campuses sparked the fire that has spread across the nation.\n\n\u201cIt has always been true but is now becoming obvious to more Americans that what happens on campuses does not stay on campuses, or only affect the minority of Americans with college degrees,\u201d she explained, adding:\n\nU.S. colleges and universities create the ideas, atmosphere, and policies that affect the nation, plus the nation\u2019s taxpayers underwrite the bulk of our elite\u2019s credentials through these institutions, and this is why everyone should care and raise his or her voice about what happens there.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s Title IX rules that amped up campus kangaroo courts were quite clearly a test run of the kind of sexist mob attacks they want to bring to the entire culture,\u201d Pullmann continued. \u201cThe effects are to degrade society by degrading justice itself, by reducing it to identity politics rather than the truth of what happened.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Breitbart News, Breitbart News", "title": "Gray Wolves Risk Losing Federal Protection Under Republican Bill", "description": "(AP) \u2014 An environmental group has sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to preserve federal protections for gray wolves.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/15/gray-wolves-risk-losing-federal-protection-under-republican-bill/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/07/wi/ap/19/nt86qj.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:13:20Z", "content": "The Center for Biological Diversity filed the lawsuit in federal court in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, a day after the service denied the groups petition for a nationwide recovery plan.

This once-fringe organisation\u2019s popularity grew to the point where it actually came in first place in the European Parliamentary elections of 2014, creating real fears among the Tories that UKIP would cost them key marginal seats in the General Election the following year, at a time when none of the mainstream political parties commanded an outright majority in Parliament.\n\nThe Gamble that Failed\n\nIn an attempt to defang the UKIP snake, Tory prime minister David Cameron \u2014 then governing in coalition with the left-liberal, fanatically europhile Liberal Democrats \u2014 offered to hold an in/out referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union in his 2015 election manifesto.\n\nThe political consensus at the time was that, as in 2010, no one political party would win an outright parliamentary majority in the 2015 election, and so there was some question as to whether Cameron ever really planned on holding an EU referendum. Many commentators believed the proposal was simply a ploy to win UKIP votes, and that he was confident a referendum would, in fact, be blocked by the other, anti-referendum parties in Parliament when the time came for his minority or coalition government to honour his pledge.\n\nAs it turned out, however, the Tories did win an outright, if fairly slim, majority in an upset victory, inadvertently forcing him to hold a vote for real.\n\nMPs authorised the referendum legislation by a voting margin of around six to one, but only a small minority of them actually backed Brexit in the subsequent campaign \u2014 perhaps a third of Tory MPs, the small band of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs representing Northern Ireland, and a mere handful of politicians from the left-wing opposition parties.\n\nThere was a confident expectation that the official Remain campaign, backed by all the machinery of the British government and the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, with the support of big business and the global establishment \u2014 including then-U.S. President Barack Obama and the leadership of the International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, and other international bodies \u2014 would carry the day.\n\nThey were all stunned when, in defiance of the polls, the British public backed Leave by a margin of well over a million votes on June 23rd, 2016, thanks in large part to a huge number of working-class voters being won over by Nigel Farage\u2019s warning that Brexit was the only way to bring end years of uncontrolled mass migration.\n\nEXCLUSIVE

June 24, 2016\n\nMeet the New Boss, Same as the Old Boss\n\nDavid Cameron, despite promising to see Brexit through if the people backed Leave prior to the referendum, stepped down as Prime Minister and Tory leader the morning after the result was announced \u2014 and the race was then on to find a replacement.\n\nBritish prime ministers are not directly elected by the people, with the position instead falling to whoever can command a majority in Parliament \u2014 in practice, this is generally the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Tories, more particularly, select their leaders from among their Parliamentary Party, with MPs winnowing a slate of candidates down to a final two, who then submit themselves to a ballot of all party members.\n\nA number of prominent Brexiteer Tories put their names forward \u2014 but, as mentioned above, Brexiteers are a minority within the Tory Party.\n\nThis allowed Remain-supporting Home Secretary Theresa May to secure the lion\u2019s share of support among the party\u2019s MPs \u2014 with Andrea Leadsom, the relatively unknown Brexiteer candidate who reached the final two with her, simply stepping aside rather than contest the leadership in a ballot of all party members, believing she did not have sufficient support among her predominantly Remain-supporting parliamentary colleagues to lead an effective administration.\n\nThis outcome was unpopular with the party membership \u2014 who unlike their MPs mostly backed Leave \u2014 but they were reassured when Mrs May appeared to adopt a strong Brexit platform, promising she would deliver on the Leave vote with a deal that took Britain out of the EU\u2019s Customs Union, Single Market, and associated Free Movement regime.\n\nMoreover, she warned that, if Brussels would not agree a free trade agreement on such terms, she was clear that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d.\n\nThe Gamble that Failed, Redux\n\nWith the opposition Labour Party in the doldrums under Jeremy Corbyn, an old-fashioned socialist who had been a marginal figure among Labour MPs prior to his election to the leadership by the party membership in 2015 \u2014 thanks to new rules which opened up the contest to a large number of hard left entryists \u2014 Theresa May decided to call a snap General Election, hoping to take advantage of polls indicating she would secure a greatly increased majority.\n\nShe did significantly increase both the overall number of ballots cast for her party and its share of the popular vote overall in the June 2017 vote\u2013 but, against all odds, Corbyn also increased his share of the vote, and in such a way that the Tories remained the single largest party in the House of Commons but lost their outright parliamentary majority.\n\nA so-called \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d arrangement was concluded with Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP so that she could carry key votes in the Commons and remain in power, but her authority was shattered.\n\nDUP\u2019s Westminster Leader: Ready to Deliver Brexit and Strengthen \u2018Our Precious Union\u2019 https://t.co/W48Y7GZbEs \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 30, 2017\n\nTheresa the Appeaser\n\nDespite her tough words on becoming party leader, it soon became clear that the Remain-supporting Prime Minister had little faith in Britain\u2019s ability to succeed in the face of an intransigent European Union.\n\nIt was months before she finally activated Article 50, the legal mechanism for leaving the European Union provided by the EU treaties, and began the two-year negotiating period it entails.\n\nDefiant words on no deal being better than a bad deal \u2014 leaving the EU without a formal exit agreement and simply dealing with the bloc on the same World Trade Organisation terms as countries like America and Australia has always been an option \u2014 soon appeared to melt away, with the Prime Minister agreeing to pay the bloc a multi-billion divorce settlement, despite the fact the United Kingdom has put more into the EU\u2019s shared budget than it has taken out of it for decades.\n\nWorse, the EU appeared to grant her nothing in return for this enormous payout \u2014 not even continued participation in relatively minor projects like the Galileo satellite programme, which Britain played a large role in funding and developing \u2014 but merely demanded the money as the price of moving on to a second phase of negotiations in which a future trade relationship which would be discussed.\n\nGlobal Britain, or Little Europe?\n\nThe EU provides for free movement of goods, capital, services and labour between member-states as part of its Single Market.\n\nThere are catches, however: goods are subject to a common set of EU standards interpreted by a European Court of Justice; the Single Market in Services exists more in theory than in practice; and Free Movement of Labour has evolved into Free Movement of People \u2014 with very limited opportunities to deport EU foreigners even if they are jobless, living as vagrants, or have criminal records.\n\nThe heart of the bloc, however, is its Customs Union. The European Union either speaks for or dictates a \u201ccommon position\u201d to of all of its members on global trade bodies, such as the World Trade Organization and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), sets common external tariffs on non-EU imports, and it enjoys \u201cexclusive competence\u201d in international trade negotiations.\n\nThis means that the UK, which is unique in the EU in that it does the bulk of its trade with countries outside the bloc, cannot negotiate free trade agreements with some of its most significant partners, including the United States and its old allies in the Commonwealth of Nations, and must instead rely on the EU to negotiate deals on its behalf.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Warns Trade Deal with UK \u2018Totally up in the Air\u2019 After May\u2019s Brexit Compromise https://t.co/kDvYDoaNlI \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 9, 2018\n\nDeals which would suit British interests but not the interests of, say, German manufacturing or French farmers, have therefore not been produced.\n\nIt had been hoped that Brexit would be an opportunity for Britain to finally strike those deals, and to lower tariffs on food, clothing, and footwear not made in the UK to help consumers \u2014 but the deal Theresa May has negotiated with the EU will not allow this.\n\nBackstops and Customs and More, Oh My\n\nAfter Brexit, the European Union\u2019s only land border with the United Kingdom will run along the frontier between the Republic of Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe European Union had claimed that the only way to avoid a so-called \u2018hard border\u2019 between the Republic and the Province is for the latter to remain entirely within its Customs Union and Single Market, necessitating customs checks between Northern Ireland and the British mainland.\n\nA majority of residents in the troubled province support the British Union, and were for many years subjected to a paramilitary terror campaign by elements within the Irish nationalist minority who sought to absorb Northern Ireland into an all-island state.\n\nThe DUP, the main representative of the British Unionist majority in Northern Ireland, was therefore totally unwilling to countenance the EU\u2019s proposal \u2014 the so-called \u201cbackstop solution\u201d to keeping the Irish border open \u2014 as it would at least to some extent sunder Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom, and turn it into a kind of EU province.\n\nRather than insist on technical solutions and mutual recognition of standards to resolve the border question, however, Theresa May chose to offer concessions: she said she would keep the entire United Kingdom in the EU Customs Union, and submit to a \u2018common rulebook\u2019 for goods identical to the EU\u2019s rulebook, as interpreted by the EU court.\n\nThis would avoid the need for a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland or between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK \u2014 but the price is that Britain will remain unable to strike meaningful trade deals even after Brexit, or set its own rules with respect to goods and customs \u2014 or even have a minority say over them, as it does as an EU member.\n\nFirst Rebellion\n\nThis deal formed the basis of Theresa May\u2019s so-called \u2018Chequers Plan\u2019 for Brexit, and began the exodus of Brexit-supporting Tories from her administration.\n\nThe first to go was the David Davis, the Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) specifically created to deliver Brexit, and the nominal chief negotiator for Britain in its negotiations with the EU.\n\nThe Three Brexiteers: Farage, Hoey, Davis Launch Campaign to \u2018Chuck Chequers\u2019 and Save Brexit https://t.co/nXyJH3JsQe \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 22, 2018\n\nHe and his junior minister, Steve Baker, indicated that \u2018Chequers\u2019 had been developed essentially behind their backs by Theresa May\u2019s main EU adviser, Soviet-sympathising bureaucrat Olly Robbins, while they had been working on an entirely different set of proposals (and \u2018No Deal\u2019 contingencies) in the belief that they would form the basis of Britain\u2019s proposals.\n\nDavis was followed by Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary Boris Johnson, who had been the effective leader of the official Vote Leave campaign during the referendum, who argued that the PM\u2019s plan would reduce Britain to the status of an \u201cEU colony\u201d.\n\nThe rebels failed to mount a leadership challenge against the Prime Minister, however \u2014 with insiders reporting there was some disagreement between Davis and Johnson over who should take over from May as leader \u2014 and she reacted by simply strengthening her grip on the Cabinet.\n\nJohnson was replaced with Jeremy Hunt \u2014 a staunch Remainer \u2014 and Davis was replaced with Dominic Raab \u2014 a less prominent Brexiteer, who was soon officially sidelined in the negotiations by May and the civil servant Robbins.\n\nThe Soros Vote\n\nBy now, more than two years had passed since the Leave vote in 2016. Remainer politicians, who had largely claimed they would \u201crespect the result\u201d in the weeks and months after the referendum, were emboldened by the shambolic conduct of the negotiations, and a belief that enough older Leave voters had died and enough young Remainers come of age that they could now win a re-run.\n\nA large segment of opposition MPs and a small band of Tory EU loyalists thus began openly agitating for \u201cthe people\u201d to have a \u201cfinal say\u201d on the Prime Minister\u2019s deal, with the option of staying in the EU after all if they voted against it.\n\nThis campaign has been organised under the cross-party \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d banner and bankrolled in part by billionaire plutocrat George Soros \u2014 a matter of some controversy, when the Hungarian-American\u2019s conduct is considered alongside ongoing efforts by elements of the \u201cRemain Resistance\u201d to dismiss the original Leave vote as illegitimate due to unsubstantiated claims of foreign interference in the 2016 referendum.\n\nSoros-Backed Group Launches Campaign to Stop \u2018Harmful\u2019 Brexit with Second Referendum https://t.co/V9FjRV2xMJ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 30, 2018\n\nThe Worst Deal in History\n\nIt is against this backdrop that Theresa May\u2019s draft withdrawal agreement with the European Union, based on her Chequers proposals, has been unveiled, to nigh-universal condemnation.\n\nIt stipulates that not only shall Britain hand over tens of billions of pounds to the European Union despite no guarantee of inclusion in Galileo and other joint programmes, but it shall indeed submit to an EU-regulated, UK-wide \u201csingle customs territory\u201d in goods and agri-products \u2014 the services industry so important to Britain is excluded \u2014 and it shall additionally submit Northern Ireland to extra Single Market obligations.\n\nListen \u2014 Farage: This is the Worst Deal in History Because The People Who Oppose Brexit Are Still in Charge https://t.co/vWOqSGdCPP \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 14, 2018\n\nThis would mean that, for the first time, the Irish government in Dublin would, through its role in EU rulemaking, have in some ways more of a say over Northern Ireland\u2019s laws than either London or the local administration in Belfast.\n\nIncredibly, the agreement also requires the United Kingdom to accept that it cannot pull out of this \u201cbackstop\u201d arrangement unilaterally, but must first secure the permission of the European Union or appeal to a third party arbitrator \u2014 an even more dependent situation than it finds itself in as a full EU member.\n\nThese \u201cbackstop\u201d concessions by the Prime Minister on Northern Ireland, more than any others, appears to have been the final straw for not only Tory Brexiteers, but for the DUP MPs on whom the Prime Minister relies for her parliamentary majority. They have all vowed to vote down the deal when it comes before Parliament for approval.\n\nHowever, even these dire arrangements will come into force only after a so-called \u2018transition period\u2019 following Britain\u2019s formal exit from the EU in March 2019, in which it will essentially remain a full EU member minus its representation in EU institutions.\n\nIt was initially thought that this \u2018transition\u2019 would last only to the end of 2020, but the withdrawal agreement states that it could be extended to \u201c[December 31 20XX]\u201d by mutual agreement \u2014 meaning the United Kingdom could theoretically remain in EU purgatory until December 2099.\n\nEndgame?\n\nDominic Raab, David Davis\u2019s successor as Secretary of State for Brexit, was the first big hitter to walk out of government over the withdrawal agreement. Like his predecessor, he was kept in the dark about the Prime Minister\u2019s plans until the last moment, and refused to board a jet waiting to take him to Brussels so he could stand beside lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier as the deal was unveiled there.\n\nHe has been followed by the Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Esther McVey, and a number of Ministers of State.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, however, the European Research Group (ERG) faction of Brexit-supporting Tory MPs and their influential ad hoc leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, have finally stopped campaigning only for the Prime Minister\u2019s policies to be changed, and are now calling for fresh leadership as well.\n\nRees-Mogg Calls for Vote of No Confidence in May, \u2018What Has Been Achieved Today Is Not Brexit\u2019 https://t.co/6P3TD2eu1U \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 15, 2018\n\nA vote of no confidence, therefore, appears to be in the offing, with it seeming certain that enough letters have been sent to to the chairman of the 1922 committee, which represents Tory MPs who are not government ministers (backbenchers), to reach the 15 per cent threshold required to trigger a leadership challenge under Conservative Party rules.\n\nEven if the Prime Minister survives a confidence vote, it seems certain her deal will not survive a parliamentary vote, with the left-wing opposition, the DUP, and a large number of her own MPs now determined to vote against it come what may.\n\nWith the country ill-prepared for a \u2018No Deal\u2019 clean Brexit \u2014 arguably deliberately, in order to bounce Brexiteers into accepting Brexit In Name Only \u2014 and no majority for it in a Remain-dominated Parliament, it is now very unclear how things will unfold.\n\nEither the country will have to find a way to make \u2018No Deal\u2019 work with only a few months to go before Brexit Day next March, or the question of whether Britain will leave the EU at all will be reopened through the mechanism of a so-called \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d.\n\nThe latter option faces legal obstacles and would require collusion between British Remainers and the EU itself \u2014 but with senior EU loyalists including Tony Blair, Sir John Major, and Sir Nick Clegg having held regular meetings with the EU\u2019s negotiating team ever since the Leave vote was cast, it may well be that a contingency plan for just such an event has already been hatched.\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery"}, {"source": {"id":

However, there are nine exceptions to this immunity, one of which is the so-called \u201ctort exception\u201d clause.\n\nTwo years before the Kentucky hearing, a federal appeals court had said that the case could proceed under the tort exemption to the 1976 act, if it could be demonstrated that U.S. bishops were following official Vatican policy.\n\nThis is what makes the Vatican\u2019s eleventh-hour intervention in Baltimore so potentially momentous. It seems to willing wave aside the carefully crafted legal boundaries that the Vatican has energetically used to defend itself from international prosecution.\n\nThe failure of the U.S. bishops to challenge the order from the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Bishops suggests that the bishops are indeed answerable to the Holy See on operational matters dealing with sex abuse policy.\n\nThis tacit admission will almost certainly have massive ramifications in future litigation.\n\nConsidering the rise in abuse claims facing the Church in the United States, it is difficult to imagine that the Vatican will not see a dramatic increase in legal actions, which could open the Holy See to billions of dollars in claims.\n\nThe O\u2019Bryan action was withdrawn in 2011, in part because 243 abuse victims had already reached a direct settlement with the Archdiocese of Louisville and in part because of the precedent of earlier court rulings recognising the Holy See\u2019s immunity from prosecution.\n\nAccording to research compiled by Bishop-Accountability.org, to date 15 U.S. dioceses have been declared bankrupt following the post-Boston settlements, with post-1980s settlements totaling over $3 billion.\n\nThe Vatican\u2019s apparent abandonment of a long-standing principle of legal defense has potentially game-changing consequences for the future.\n\nThe direct Vatican intervention in the U.S. bishops\u2019 response to the sex abuse crisis could easily be the most consequential act of Pope Francis\u2019 papacy, which is not precisely the legacy his followers would wish.\n\nBenjamin Harnwell is director of the Rome-based Dignitatis Humanae Institute.

Ted Cruz\u2019s (R-TX) 2016 presidential campaign and network contributor Rick Tyler and said the Republican Party will likely not survive aligning closely with President Donald Trump.\n\nTyler said, \u201cThey lost the majority, which is a whole different world for the Republicans.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cYou have seen President Trump\u2019s behavior over the last week\u2014it has not been very cheerful of all the things going on. Internally, it looks like, based on reporting and NBC reporting, that he\u2019s quite distraught about the elections. He\u2019s not happy about it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what Republicans should do in 2020, Tyler said, \u201cYou have to figure out how to get white affluent, educated women back from the suburbs, because when you combine that coalition with African-Americans and Hispanics, which the Democrats now seem to be solidifying, that would be a generational realignment.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIf that\u2019s true, the Republicans won\u2019t be in charge for a very, very long time. I also believe, and it won\u2019t surprise you, that the Republicans need to learn to stand up to the president when he is butting up against constitutional, traditional norms of the White House. And, yes, that may cost another seat, but it\u2019s okay, then you go back to being a citizen. But I think in the long run, the damage to the Republican party is such that, I don\u2019t know that the Republican Party survives. Because what happens is now the party is so attached to a personality, the way the Kadima Party in Israel was attached to Ariel Sharon. It doesn\u2019t exist anymore when Ariel Sharon passed on. When Bibi Netanyahu leaves the stage, I don\u2019t believe there will be a Likud party anymore. When Donald Trump leaves, there will be no Republican party anymore. I don\u2019t know what will replace it, but I really don\u2019t think that coalition exists anymore.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think things are going to get worse for the president and not better, and the Republican party is going to figure out that if they want to be in power, aligning yourself with this president as he keeps chipping away at the traditional people who are aligned with the Republican party. And if you look at the electoral map for 2020, the president\u2019s got real problems. There\u2019s still a challenge. He could lose Florida and any other state and lose, or you need to beat him in three different states. But remember, in the Midwest, so you\u2019ve got Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, if he loses all three of those, it\u2019s over. And remember, we had zero \u2014 the Republicans went 0 for 6 in those statewide races, governors and U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Kyle Morris, Kyle Morris", "title": "WATCH: Senator Kamala Harris Grills Nominee to Lead ICE, Compares Agency to the KKK", "description": "During a Thursday confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Democrat California Sen.

CNN president Jeff Zucker has not replied to numerous requests for comment from Breitbart News over the past day since Avenatti\u2019s arrest asking if he and his network denounce and disavow domestic violence, even if the woman hit Avenatti first as Avenatti allegedly claims.\n\nThe RNC\u2019s records requests were sent to two different entities. One was sent to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and the other to the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The RNC\u2019s deputy research director Scott Parker filed the requests.\n\nRNC Request to LA Sheriff \u2013 Avenatti by Wynn Marlow on Scribd\n\nBoth requests, which were provided to Breitbart News ahead of their public release, ask the authorities per open records and transparency laws, to provide any and all \u201crecords that mention, reference, or relate to the arrest, booking, or charging of Michael Avenatti that occurred on November 14,\u201d as well as any and all audio recordings of 911 emergency calls\u201d and other calls relating to Avenatti\u2019s arrest and any and all \u201cpolice reports, felony DV reports, intake reports, toxicology reports, statements by witnesses, statements by the perpetrator, correspondence, and any other information related to the arrest, booking, or charging of Michael Avenatti.\u201d\n\nRNC Request to LAPD \u2013 Avenatti by Wynn Marlow on Scribd\n\nThe requests also seek any video authorities may have collected of Avenatti\u2019s intake, including any dashboard or body camera videos as well as any photographs including the \u201cmug shot\u201d of Avenatti at booking.\n\nAvenatti is a very public figure, and the Washington Post has ranked him among the top 15 Democrat presidential candidates in 2020. In a headline, Politico magazine boldly declared that Avenatti is \u201cwinning the 2020 Democratic Primary.\u201d He has also said he is \u201cseriously considering\u201d a bid for the presidency in 2020.\n\nPerhaps most ironically, one of the reasons why Avenatti\u2013who is now formally charged with felony domestic violence\u2013wants to run for president in 2020 on the Democrat ticket is because he wants to restore \u201cdignity\u201d to the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about whether I have the ability to potentially help solve this nightmare, this dumpster fire of an administration, and help us push the reset button and instill some respect and dignity back to the Oval Office and America\u2019s standing, both domestically and abroad,\u201d Avenatti told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nGiven what Los Angeles police have charged him with, this tweet from Avenatti is even more ironic:\n\nLet me be clear: I have consistently called on white males like me to step, take responsibility, and be a part of stoping the sexism and bigotry that other white males engage in. It is especially important for them to call out other white males. I make this pt in my speeches. \u2014 Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) October 25, 2018\n\nBut the Avenatti presidential circus is not something that has just amused top media organizations like CNN and MSNBC who have put him on repeatedly, or places like the Washington Post, Politico, Daily Beast, Bloomberg, and more which have legitimized him with glowing profiles and coverage\u2013top Democrats in the party have opened up to him too.\n\n\u201cI think he is a phenomenal guy and I have gotten to know him a bit in the last week. We went to dinner last week, he was in Youngstown and I really like him,\u201d Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH), a top Democrat opponent of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid to retake the Speakership, told CNN in August for instance.\n\nFormer Hillary Clinton aide Adam Parkhomenko has gone on record to say Avenatti has the best chance of any Democrat to defeat Donald Trump in 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of like Teflon,\u201d Parkhomento says of Avenatti\u2013a point that has been similarly made about Trump.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of campaigns that aren\u2019t effective, don\u2019t fight back, and just hire a bunch of their friends,\u201d Parkhomenko said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing everything he needs to do to flip a light switch if he decides to run.\u201d\n\nAvenatti attended Democratic National Committee (DNC) events over the summer\u2013and while there Michigan\u2019s Democrat Party chairman Brandon Dillon says he asked Avenatti to come to Michigan to help Democrats campaign.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely got a message, and I think Democrats need to hear about being tough,\u201d Dillon said in an interview with Vice about Avenatti. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly I think somebody who is giving the president fits and has been someone who\u2019s been fighting, so you know I\u2019d be interested to hear what he has to say and I\u2019m sure a lot of people in Michigan would as well.\u201d\n\nThe Nebraska Democrat Party chair Jane Kleeb also told Vice she liked having Avenatti at the DNC meetings.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in, right? He\u2019s running for president and I think it\u2019s good he\u2019s here and I think that all the other candidates should also be showing support for the state party infrastructure,\u201d Kleeb said.\n\nEven top DNC officials liked having Avenatti there:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a breath of fresh air in our stale, staid\u2014\u201d Diane Robertson, a deputy finance chair of the DNC, told VICE News, leaving the word \u201cparty\u201d left unsaid. \u201cWe need some fire, and he\u2019s fiery.\u201d\n\nAvenatti has also said in an interview on MSNBC that he has received enormous support from Democrat Party leadership and from party officials nationwide:\n\nBut now that he is charged with felony domestic violence by the LAPD, his fighter style is coming under scrutiny.\n\nCops found the victim with a swollen face, they arrested you for felony DV, got her a restraining order, you had to post $50,000 bail, and the investigation is ongoing.

That Article II provision says further that for all lower-ranking officers, Congress can specify whether each is appointed by the president directly (without the Senate), by department heads, or by the courts.\n\nThe Vacancies Reform Act specifies three ways that temporary appointments can be made when senior positions become vacant. President Trump invoked one of those three, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345(a)(3), to appoint DOJ chief of staff Whitaker to temporarily serve as acting attorney general.\n\nVarious presidential critics attacked the appointment, acknowledging that the president\u2019s actions are authorized by the Vacancies Reform Act, but arguing that this federal law is unconstitutional under the Appointments Clause.\n\nBreitbart News editorialized on the absurd results that would follow if a president had no authority to fill those senior roles temporarily when vacancies exist. A new president from a new party taking over would have to keep the entire senior staff of the opposition party, and units like U.S. Attorney Offices would shut down completely because none of the dozens of career prosecutors in the office would be constitutionally eligible to take over their cases when the only Senate-confirmed official \u2013 the partisan U.S. attorney appointed by the former president \u2013 leaves or is fired by the new president.\n\nNow OLC is weighing in, building on the 2003 OLC Memo originally signed by Acting Assistant Attorney General Ed Whelan. Ironically, Whelan was the principal deputy assistant attorney general, but under the same Vacancies Reform Act, he was temporarily serving the place of the Senate-confirmed head of OLC during a vacancy very similar to the one involving Whitaker.\n\nThe Supreme Court declared in 1898 in United States v. Eaton that a non-Senate-confirmed official may fill Senate-confirmed positions \u201cfor a limited time\u201d and \u201cunder special and temporary conditions.\u201d\n\nThe OLC Memo explains that while \u201cAttorney General\u201d is certainly a principal officer under the Appointments Clause, and, therefore, requires confirmation, \u201cActing Attorney General\u201d is an inferior officer, and, therefore, Congress can empower the president to fill that position without the Senate.\n\nEngel further shows how many presidents from the beginning of the Republic, and as recently as George W. Bush and Barack Obama, used precisely the same authority to do precisely the same thing. Many of those criticizing President Trump\u2019s action were prominent in the law at those times and raised no objections.\n\nThis is hardly an academic debate that will linger without resolution. Maryland is currently in a lawsuit against the Trump administration concerning part of the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a, Obamacare). Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was a named defendant, and the DOJ is, of course, the agency defending all of the relevant actors in the federal government.\n\nMaryland argues that as the case is amended to name a substitute defendant for Sessions, that substitute must be Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, instead of Whitaker. Because the DOJ\u2019s pleadings against the Obamacare lawsuit are due shortly, and the acting attorney general has the final authority to decide which arguments the U.S. government makes in the case, Maryland is asking for the district court to expedite ruling on whether Whitaker is in charge instead of Rosenstein.\n\nThat ruling could be taken up in what is called an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, currently one of the two most liberal federal appeals courts in the country. From there, the losing party could petition the Supreme Court to decide the matter.\n\nThe case is Maryland v. United States, No. 1:18-cv-2849, in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Gore decision, by locking in procedures that do not allow for potential problems.\n\nFlorida\u2019s 67 counties faced a 3:00 p.m. Thursday deadline to finish recounts that could determine the next senator and governor in one of America\u2019s top political battlegrounds.\n\nPalm Beach County\u2019s election supervisor previously warned that the county will not be able to finish on time.\n\nSusan Bucher defended her office Thursday morning, saying the incomplete recount was not \u201cfor lack of human effort.\u201d\n\nBucher explained that the elections office in Riviera Beach shut down Wednesday night because \u201cwhen you work about 45 hours in a row, you have to let people sleep.\u201d\n\nBucher says she believes her office did everything it could despite not completing the U.S. Senate race recount.\n\nShe blames aging equipment for the delays in meeting Thursday\u2019s deadline for machine recount results.\n\nSix election-related lawsuits are pending in Tallahassee. Earlier Thursday, Walker ordered that voters be given until 5:00 p.m. Saturday to show a valid identification and fix their ballots if they have not been counted due to mismatched signatures.\n\nState officials testified that nearly 4,000 mailed-in ballots were set aside because local officials decided the signature on the envelope did not match the signature on file. If those voters can prove their identity, their votes will now be counted and included in final official returns due from each county by noon Sunday.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Florida Democrats called on voters to submit absentee ballots after Election Day with altered forms made to appear as though they were done prior to the legal deadline. Party officials hope a judge will allow the votes to be counted. As Breitbart News\u2019s Joel Pollak reported, critics believe the move would constitute potential election fraud.\n\nNaples Daily News\u2019s Ana Ceballos reported on the specifics of the plan:\n\nA day after Florida\u2019s election left top state races too close to call, a Democratic party leader directed staffers and volunteers to share altered election forms with voters to fix signature problems on absentee ballots after the state\u2019s deadline. The altered forms surfaced in Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties and were reported to federal prosecutors to review for possible election fraud as Florida counties complete a required recount in three top races. But an email obtained by the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida shows that Florida Democrats were organizing a broader statewide effort beyond those counties to give voters the altered forms to fix improper absentee ballots after the Nov. 5 deadline. Democratic party leaders provided staffers with copies of a form, known as a \u201ccure affidavit,\u201d that had been modified to include an inaccurate Nov. 8 deadline. One Palm Beach Democrat said in an interview the idea was to have voters fix and submit as many absentee ballots as possible with the altered forms in hopes of later including them in vote totals if a judge ruled such ballots were allowed.\n\nIn his ruling, Walker stated he was concerned that some counties may not complete their work by the deadline. But he said there is a lack of information about when Palm Beach County would wrap up its work.\n\nWalker said he cannot \u201cfashion a remedy in the dark.\u201d\n\nOnce the machine recount is complete, state law requires a hand review of races with margins of less than 0.25 percentage points. That almost certainly means another recount in the Senate race, with unofficial results showing Republican Gov. Rick Scott ahead of Nelson by 0.14 percentage points.\n\nAlso, the election will not be certified until Tuesday, even though the machine recount may essentially bring a conclusion to the governor\u2019s race, where Republican Ron DeSantis leads Democrat Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in unofficial results.\n\nNelson, a three-time incumbent, has defended his legal strategy that resulted in Walker\u2019s ruling, saying in a statement Wednesday that his goal was to \u201cto make sure that every lawful vote be counted correctly in this Senate race, and that Floridians\u2019 right to participate in this process is protected.\u201d\n\nRepublicans say in their own lawsuits and motions that Democrats are trying to change the rules after the voting did not go their way.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to fight to defend Florida law and uphold the will of the voters,\u201d said Chris Hartline, a spokesman for Scott.\n\nNelson and Democrats had wanted Walker to order the counting of all mail-in ballots rejected for a mismatched signature, arguing that local election officials are not handwriting experts.\n\nWalker said he could not go along with that suggestion.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Breitbart News", "title": "California: Ferocious Fires Spark Health Concerns as Death Toll Hits 59", "description": "(AP) \u2014 At least 59 people were killed and 300 were unaccounted for a week after the flames swept through parts of California.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/local/2018/11/15/california-ferocious-fires-spark-health-concerns-as-death-toll-hits-59/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/11.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:32:23Z", "content": "Smoke masks.

This is how Californians are trying to cope with wildfires choking the state, but experts say an increase in serious health problems may be almost inevitable for vulnerable residents as the disasters become more commonplace.\n\nResearch suggests children, the elderly and those with existing health problems are most at risk.\n\nShort-term exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen existing asthma and lung disease, leading to emergency room treatment or hospitalization, studies have shown.\n\nIncreases in doctor visits or hospital treatment for respiratory infections, bronchitis and pneumonia in otherwise healthy people also have been found during and after wildfires.\n\nSome studies also have found increases in ER visits for heart attacks and strokes in people with existing heart disease on heavy smoke days during previous California wildfires, echoing research on potential risks from urban air pollution.\n\nFor most healthy people, exposure to wildfire smoke is just an annoyance, causing burning eyes, scratchy throats or chest discomfort that all disappear when the smoke clears.\n\nBut doctors, scientists and public health officials are concerned that the changing face of wildfires will pose a much broader health hazard,\n\n\u201cWildfire season used to be June to late September. Now it seems to be happening all year round. We need to be adapting to that,\u201d Dr. Wayne Cascio, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cardiologist, said this week.\n\nIn an overview published earlier this year, Cascio wrote that the increasing frequency of large wildland fires, urban expansion into wooded areas and an aging population are all increasing the number of people at risk for health problems from fires.\n\nWood smoke contains some of the same toxic chemicals as urban air pollution, along with tiny particles of vapor and soot 30 times thinner than a human hair. These can infiltrate the bloodstream, potentially causing inflammation and blood vessel damage even in healthy people, research on urban air pollution has shown. Studies have linked heart attacks and cancer with long-term exposure to air pollution.\n\nWhether exposure to wildfire smoke carries the same risks is uncertain, and determining harm from smog versus wildfire smoke can be tricky, especially with wind-swept California wildfires spreading thick smoke hundreds of miles away into smoggy big cities.\n\n\u201cThat is the big question,\u201d said Dr. John Balmes, a University of California, San Francisco, professor of medicine who studies air pollution.\n\n\u201cVery little is known about the long-term effects of wildfire smoke because it\u2019s hard to study populations years after a wildfire,\u201d Balmes said.\n\nDecreased lung function has been found in healthy firefighters during fire season. They tend to recover but federal legislation signed this year will establish a U.S. registry tracking firefighters and potential risks for various cancers, including lung cancer. Some previous studies suggested a risk.\n\nBalmes noted that increased lung cancer rates have been found in women in developing countries who spend every day cooking over wood fires.\n\nThat kind of extreme exposure doesn\u2019t typically happen with wildfires, but experts worry about the kinds of health damage that may emerge for firefighters and residents with these blazes occurring so often.\n\nWhether that includes more cancer is unknown. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about that,\u201d Balmes said.\n\nRegular folks breathing in all that smoke worry about the risks too.\n\nSmoke from the fire that decimated the Northern California city of Paradise darkened skies this week in San Francisco, nearly 200 miles southwest, and the air smelled \u201clike you were camping,\u201d said Michael Northover, a contractor.\n\nHe and his 14-year-old son have first-time sinus infections that Northover blames on the smoke.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all kind of feeling it,\u201d Northover said.\n\nClasses were canceled Thursday in at least six universities in Northern California as smoke from the fire continued to blanket all nine counties of the Bay Area. Some were closing all buildings but others, including Cal State East Bay said libraries, health centers and dining halls would stay open.\n\nAt Chico State University, 11 miles from Paradise, ash was falling this week and classes were canceled until after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of freaky to see your whole town wearing air masks and trying to get out of smoke,\u201d said freshman Mason West, 18. \u201cYou can see the particles. Obviously it\u2019s probably not good to be breathing that stuff in.\u201d\n\nWest returned home this week to Santa Rosa, hard hit by last year\u2019s wine country fire, only to find it shrouded in smoke from the Paradise fire 100 miles away. West\u2019s family had to evacuate last year for a week but their home was spared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as bad here as it was in Chico,\u201d West said. \u201cIt almost feels like you just can\u2019t get away from it.\u201d\n\nSmoke has been so thick in Santa Rosa that researchers postponed a door-to-door survey there for a study of health effects of last year\u2019s fire.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t feel we could justify our volunteer interns going knocking on doors when all the air quality alerts were saying stay indoors,\u201d said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a public health researcher at the University of California, Davis. The study includes an online survey of households affected by last year\u2019s fire, with responses from about 6,000 people so far.\n\nPreliminary data show widespread respiratory problems, eye irritations, anxiety, depression and sleep problems around the time of the fire and months later.\n\n\u201cConventional thinking is that these effects related to fires are transient. It\u2019s not entirely clear that\u2019s the case,\u201d Hertz-Picciotto said.\n\nResearchers also will be analyzing cord blood and placentas collected from a few dozen women who were pregnant during the fire, seeking evidence of stress markers or exposure to smoke chemicals.\n\nThey hope to continue the study for years, seeking evidence of long-term physical and emotional harms to fire evacuees and their children.\n\nOther studies have linked emotional stress in pregnant women to developmental problems in their children and \u201cthis was quite a stress,\u201d Hertz-Picciotto said.\n\nIt\u2019s a kind of stress that many people need to prepare for as the climate warms and wildfires proliferate, she said.\n\n\u201cAny of us could wake up tomorrow and lose everything we own,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty scary.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner.

The frequency with which these outlets attacked the Weston human rights grounds diminished somewhat following the meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in June.\n\nThe recent broadside against America and the \u201cWest,\u201d which Rodong Sinmun notably includes Japan in, appears to be a rebuttal to an expansive Human Rights Watch report published this month alleging widespread sexual abuse of women on the part of North Korean communist agents. The newspaper does not mention the report by name, instead asserting that the West generally \u201ccooked up and spread a human rights document of falsehoods and fabrications.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S., Europe and Japan are not in a position to take issue with other countries\u2019 human rights problems, as the world\u2019s most serious violations of human rights occur in Western countries,\u201d the newspaper declared, according to a translation by the South Korean outlet Yonhap.\n\nThe translation by the monitor site KCNA Watch \u2013 a summary of the article in the sister news service Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) \u2013 adds that the newspaper condemned the United States in particular for being \u201cswarming with unemployed and homeless people. Murder, robbery and other high-profile crimes are rampant there.\u201d\n\n\u201cColored and minority races there have their rights wantonly violated in education, legal protection, election, etc,\u201d the commentary continues, also accusing Japan of widespread discrimination and child abuse. Japan, in particular, boasts a \u201cpitiful\u201d human rights situation, the newspaper alleges.\n\nWhile the number of articles accusing America of serially violating the human rights of its citizens diminished in 2018, they did not entirely disappear. In April, prior to the meeting between Trump and Kim, Rodong Sinmun asserted that the United States \u201cis the worst human rights abuser with neither justifications nor face to talk about human rights of other countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the U.S. to take issue with \u201chuman rights\u201d issue [sic] in other countries and make profound confusing [sic] of the right and the wrong while shelving the hideous human rights performance in its own country, where all sorts of injustice, deprivation of rights and social evils stalk, is a wanton distortion of genuine human rights,\u201d the newspaper argued. A month later, it proclaimed American republican democracy the world\u2019s \u201cmost reactionary and unpopular ruling system.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the North Korean government issued a white paper officially analyzing human rights in the United States. North Korean geopolitical experts concluded from their findings that the United States is \u201ca human rights desert where even elementary human rights are not provided.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, North Korea, according to its propaganda outlets, is a \u201cgood example\u201d on human rights that seeks to spread the \u201cpolitics of love\u201d around the world.\n\nRodong Sinmun\u2018s attack on the United States Thursday echoes the tone of a similar complaint from its main sovereign ally, the government of China, this week. In response to news that American lawmakers are seeking to impose sanctions on those responsible for placing an estimated million members of China\u2019s Muslim Uighur ethnic minority in internment camps, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying argued that the United States suffers from \u201csystematic racial discrimination.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to drug crimes, black Americans are about 12 times more likely to be wrongfully convicted than innocent white people. Black male offenders received sentences on average nearly 20 percent longer than those of similarly situated white male offenders,\u201d she claimed, expressing hope that black Americans would receive similarly positive treatment in their countries as the aid she alleged Uighurs receive in the mandatory internment camps.\n\nYonhap notes that the North Korean editorial also surfaced as the United States prepares for another resolution condemning the atrocious human right crimes committed by the Kim regime. The Human Rights Watch report is the most recent expose on the topic, finding that sexual violence, including rape, on the part of members of the communist regime has \u201ccome to be accepted as part of ordinary life\u201d for most women in the country.\n\nSexual violence is particularly prevalent against women confined to one of North Koreans notorious labor camps, where guards regularly rape victims both as punishment and entertainment, the NGO found. North Korea uses labor camps to contain and torture the families of Christians, political dissidents, and other undesirables. Up to three generations of families can face punishment in response to one member\u2019s defiance, according to multiple studies of North Korea\u2019s caste system.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Joel B.

But he also said that he believed that a divided government had tremendous dealmaking potential.\n\nOther bipartisan deals are pending, including reform of marijuana policy. In that light, the First Step Act could kick off an effort to address big challenges that need bipartisan support to pass.\n\n1. Infrastructure \u2013 Trump has proposed upgrading roads, bridges, and airports for three years. Democrats also favor investing in infrastructure \u2014 though under Obama, that meant massive spending on dead-end boondoggles like Solyndra and high-speed rail. Trump\u2019s idea is to harness private sector capital. With Democratic support, there may be a way to leverage small amounts of federal spending to encourage large amounts of private funding.\n\n2. Prescription drug prices \u2013 Trump is the first Republican leader to take up the Democratic idea of using the purchasing power of the government to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs from large pharmaceutical companies. Doing so would help reduce costs to Medicare and Medicaid, while creating positive spin-offs for patients in general. Working together, the parties can force Big Pharma and its lobbyists to agree to terms.\n\n3. National debt \u2013 President Barack Obama created a bipartisan commission on the national debt as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (itself a weak compromise that came about after Obama torpedoed a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d during the debt ceiling talks). He then ignored its recommendations. Trump could revisit the discarded plan and negotiate compromises on spending and taxation from a position of strength, with the 2017 tax cuts in hand.\n\n4. Social Security \u2013 Trump has promised not to touch entitlements. Yet Social Security still has massive long-term financial problems. Trump and Democratic leaders could emulate the example of President Ronald Reagan and then-Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill and agree to raise the retirement age to 70 over the next several decades. Doing so is a relatively painless fix that could likely save Social Security without affecting present beneficiaries.\n\n5. Heath insurance \u2013 Obamacare remains a disaster, but Republicans failed to repeal and replace it. It has become clear that the public wants the guarantees of Obamacare without the high costs and restrictive regulations. Trump has spoken in the past about his preference for an Australian-style system, where basic care is guaranteed and private insurance picks up everything else. Both parties have a mandate to negotiate towards that kind of change.\n\nThese are just a few possibilities. There are risks: some compromises should be avoided, such as new, unnecessary climate change regulations. Moreover, Democrats have already rejected Trump\u2019s immigration ideas; Republicans will reject compromises on guns. In addition, many Democrats want to push Trump out of office, not help him.\n\nStill Trump has shown a remarkable ability to achieve tasks once thought impossible. He seems inclined to try again.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. He is a winner of the 2018 Robert Novak Journalism Alumni Fellowship.

Previously, the China tariffs had applied to $50 billion of goods, mostly technological imports.\n\nDespite the higher duties, the price of goods imported from China fell. This is largely due to the depreciation of China\u2019s currency against the dollar. It also may be due to Chinese companies intentionally lowering prices to make their products attractive even once the costs of tariffs were added.\n\n\u201cOur existing U.S. orders are relatively stable, but our U.S. clients are not increasing their orders,\u201d an official at a Guangzhou-based battery maker said in September.\u201cWe\u2019re keeping prices stable and swallowing the tariffs ourselves.\u201d\n\nOne importer told Breitbart News the price decline could be due to U.S. buyers shifting to the lowest price Chinese goods, avoiding higher ticket items where the tariffs would have a bigger impact.\n\nFor the year, the price of imports from China is up just 0.3 percent. Prices have fallen for three of the last four months, however.\n\nThis could put pressure on the Trump administration to raise the tariffs, something President Trump has said he is prepared to do if renewed efforts at striking a trade deal with China falter. If the prices of imports from China continue to fall, their effectiveness could be undermined.\n\nThe price of imported consumer goods overall also fell 0.1 percent in October. The price of imported capital goods also fell 0.1 percent. Since China is the largest source of U.S. imports, its not surprising that the broader price picture followed what happened with China pricing.\n\nDespite the decline in the prices of imported goods, overall import prices advanced 0.5 percent in October, the largest monthly increase since a 0.9-percent rise in May. That rise was driven by a 3.3 percent gain in fuel imports, mostly due to higher oil and natural gas prices. It\u2019s likely that will reverse when November figures are released next month thanks to falling oil prices.\n\nAs Breitbart has reported, there is no evidence that tariffs are acting as a tax on American consumers.

Venezuelans have needed a card for access to subsidized food, healthcare, and gasoline since 2014.

Many Venezuelans had suspected this from the beginning,\n\nThe two nations maintain fairly strong relations. Maduro recently traveled to Beijing in search of financial assistance, which China obliged with a $5 billion loan. However, China has previously expressed frustration with the regime\u2019s inability to pay back its debts, with Chinese banks last year cutting off credit to the regime amid concerns that Maduro was mishandling the economy.\n\nBeijing has already created its own social credit and analysis system, which rates people based on their behavior and loyalty to the Communist Party.

The Saudi government also provided its most detailed account to date of Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nTurkey, which has been strongly critical of Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to the killing, described Thursday\u2019s actions as \u201cpositive\u201d but \u201cinsufficient.\u201d The U.S. government on Thursday announced sanctions against 17 Saudis allegedly linked to Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal duly noted how the official Saudi account of the murder has changed over time, beginning with claims that Khashoggi did not die at the consulate and ending with the details released on Thursday:\n\nRiyadh said the operation was ordered on Sept. 29 by Maj. Gen. Assiri, the then-deputy head of intelligence, who assembled a team tasked with returning Mr. Khashoggi to the kingdom. Mr. Khashoggi, who had been living in self-imposed exile in the U.S. since last year, was seen as a threat to national security. The order was to return him voluntarily or by force, according to the spokesman for Saudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor. The team of 15 people included people in charge of logistics, intelligence and negotiations aimed at persuading Mr. Khashoggi to return. Mr. Qahtani, the crown prince\u2019s media adviser, was involved in coordinating possible negotiations with the journalist, the spokesman of the public prosecutor said, referring to him by his previous role. Mr. Qahtani is under investigation and banned from traveling outside the country.\n\nCritics have long derided the Saudi contention that Khashoggi died unexpectedly when \u201cnegotiations\u201d went poorly, or even that Khashoggi started a \u201cbrawl\u201d and consulate officials accidentally killed him in self-defense, as they claimed a few weeks ago. The Saudi prosecutor on Thursday conceded the \u201cteam leader on the ground in Istanbul prepared for a possible execution\u201d and admitted he included a forensics expert on the team to cover up the killing.\n\nAccording to the new account from Saudi Arabia, this \u201cteam leader\u201d decided Khashoggi could not be \u201cpersuaded to return\u201d to Riyadh, so he ordered the journalist restrained and injected with a fatal overdose of tranquilizers. This would contradict rumors spread through Turkish media over the weekend that the notorious audio recording of Khashoggi\u2019s death features the victim begging for his life as he was suffocated by a bag over his head.\n\nThe Saudi prosecutor statement on Thursday also included the first official admission that officials dismembered Khashoggi\u2019s body and carefully disposed of it, as Turkish authorities have long alleged. Until now, the Saudis have insisted they gave Khashoggi\u2019s intact body to a \u201clocal contractor\u201d for disposal, implied they do not know what became of the remains, and refused to identify the contractor.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu responded to the Saudi prosecutor\u2019s statement by declaring it \u201cpositive but insufficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t find some comments satisfying. They say this person was killed because he resisted, whereas this murder was premeditated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was not a momentary decision to dismember this body. It was preplanned. Necessary equipment was brought beforehand. It was planned how he will be killed and dismembered,\u201d he insisted, rejecting the Saudi account of a snap decision made by the team leader.\n\n\u201cWhere is the body of the murdered Khashoggi? Where was it thrown, where was it burned?\u201d he asked.\n\nCavusoglu also repeated Turkey\u2019s demand for the names of any Turkish nationals who assisted the Saudi executioners and called for all suspects in the case to be tried in Turkey.\n\nTurkey is unlikely to be satisfied with the Saudi prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that top officials such as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had no knowledge of the operation against Khashoggi, especially since the Saudis have not named the team leader who allegedly gave the kill order in Istanbul, or for that matter named the individuals who will be charged with capital offenses.\n\nThe Saudi prosecutor\u2019s investigation implicates former deputy intelligence chief Major General Ahmed al-Assiri and Saud al-Qahtani, an advisor to Crown Prince Mohammed. Assiri is allegedly the official who gave an order to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia on September 29, launching the operation that ended with the writer\u2019s death. Qahtani was allegedly involved in planning Khashoggi\u2019s \u201crepatriation.\u201d\n\nSaudi sources have portrayed Assiri as the chief suspect in Khashoggi\u2019s death for several weeks. The government fired both Assiri and Qahtani from their jobs last month. As the Wall Street Journal mentioned, Saudi Arabia banned Qahtani from travel and made him a subject of the prosecutor\u2019s investigation, while Assiri\u2019s status is more ambiguous. It is not clear if either man is among the 21 people Saudi Arabia claims to have detained, the 11 it has indicted, or the five it wishes to prosecute as death penalty cases.\n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s report included charges that the team leader in Istanbul filed a false report to Assiri claiming Khashoggi left the consulate alive, purportedly explaining why such claims were the original Saudi response to his disappearance.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday announced it has designated 17 Saudis for sanctions in connection with the \u201cabhorrent killing\u201d of Khashoggi. The Treasury Department noted these individuals \u201ctargeted and brutally killed a journalist who resided and worked in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department joined Turkish officials in expressing skepticism that Khashoggi\u2019s death was a spontaneous unplanned event. Crown Prince Mohammad\u2019s adviser Saud al-Qahtani was among those designated for sanctions, but Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri was not.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Consul General Mohammed Alotaibi was listed for sanctions, as was Maher Mutreb, an aide to the crown prince caught on Turkish surveillance video entering the Istanbul consulate shortly before Khashoggi\u2019s death. Reports claim Mutreb appears on the Khashoggi death recording asking a superior officer over the phone to \u201ctell your boss\u201d his mission was accomplished. The identity of the person he was speaking to and the \u201cboss\u201d he referenced are topics of great speculation.\n\nAlotaibi was the chief diplomat in charge of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Another of the sanctioned individuals, Salah Tubaigy, is the much-discussed forensics expert who allegedly traveled to Istanbul with a bone saw to dispose of Khashoggi\u2019s body.\n\nAnother man on the sanctions list, Meshal Saad al-Bostani, is a Saudi Royal Air Force officer who supposedly died in a suspicious car accident after the Khashoggi killing, according to Turkish media. Also named was Mustafa Almadani, the man who put on Khashoggi\u2019s clothes and strolled around Istanbul to create the illusion Khashoggi was still alive. In general, the Treasury sanctions targets track closely with Turkey\u2019s list of alleged \u201cdeath squad\u201d members.\n\nThe U.S. sanctions, applied under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Act and associated executive orders, will prevent the named individuals from accessing assets in America or engaging in transactions with Americans.\n\n\u201cThe United States continues to diligently work to ascertain all of the facts and will hold accountable each of those we find responsible in order to achieve justice for Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, children, and the family he leaves behind,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Saudi Arabia must take appropriate steps to end any targeting of political dissidents or journalists,\u201d Mnuchin added."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "James Delingpole", "title": "South Park \u2018Apologizes\u2019 to Al Gore for \u2018ManBearPig Episodes\u2019", "description": "South Park has \"apologized\" for mocking super serial Al Gore in its ManBearPig episodes.

Friends, Seinfeld and Ally McBeal: all have been criticised for demeaning attitudes to women and a lack of minority characters. But they are still celebrated as products of their time. Shows which began in the 1990s and are still going to face a different, more complicated reckoning. The most high-profile example has been The Simpsons, in which the character of Apu has been severely criticised for stereotyping south-Asian Americans. The makers of the show have responded bitterly and a dispute continues. South Park has demonstrated more humility, while managing to stay funny. It acknowledged a major misstep without any pressure to do so and found a way to apologise while remaining on brand. And for good measure, it had an episode this season which mocked the Simpsons\u2019 saga.\n\nThen again, it could just be another example of a phenomenon that has featured quite a lot in South Park over the years and which left-wing journalists often have trouble appreciating: a joke.\n\nThe \u2018apology\u2019 appeared in the most recent episode of South Park. ManBearPig returns for another rampage and the kids realize that the threat is real and only Al Gore can save them. But Al Gore \u2013 wearing his Nobel prize medal and a cape \u2013 is embittered and unforgiving and would rather be playing Red Dead Redemption. He only relents after Cartman, Stan and Kyle grovelingly apologize for having ever doubted him.\n\nIf South Park\u2019s \u201cconservatarian\u201d creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone really have abandoned their skeptical position on climate change they have picked an odd way of showing it and at a very odd time.\n\nSince 2006, when ManBearPig made his first appearance, the man-made global warming theory which Al Gore championed has been shown to be increasingly threadbare. Global warming had already begun its long pause by the time that episode was made \u2013 and world average temperatures have remained more or less flat ever since.\n\nAs for Al Gore, he is really not the influential and at least partly respected figure he once was.\n\nClimate alarmists, who used to consider him one of their big hitters, now view him as something of an embarrassment. So it would seem quite odd if Parker and Stone, with their fingers on the satirical zeitgeist, were really on a mission to rehabilitate so sorry and discredited a figure.\n\nAlso, as one of the commenters here points out, we really don\u2019t know where South Park is headed with this \u2018apology\u2019.\n\nWe don\u2019t know where they are going with this \u201capology.\u201d\n\nThe next episode may make fun of Gore\u2019s \u201csolutions\u201d (flying in private jets all over the world, selling his TV station to a dude who made billions off of oil, sexually assaulting multiple massage therapists-#believeallwomen.)\n\nNo doubt if that\u2019s the direction it does head, we\u2019ll be hearing rather less of it from the liberal media."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Lucas Nolan, Lucas Nolan", "title": "NYT: Zuckerberg 'Appalled' by Trump's Immigration Ban Comments, Questioned if He Violated Rules", "description": "According to a report from the New York Times, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so \"appalled\" by President Trump's comments on immigration, he quizzed executives to determine if the President broke Facebook's rules.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/11/15/nyt-zuckerberg-appalled-by-trumps-immigration-ban-comments-questioned-if-he-violated-rules/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/04/Mark-Zuckerberg-4-10-18-Congress-2-getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:20:19Z", "content": "Mr. Zuckerberg, who had helped found a nonprofit dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation.

It also includes hotel projects still in construction, such as the Havana Paseo del Prado, scheduled to open in 2020.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration banned Americans from a list of 80 hotels on the island, as well as prohibiting business transactions with dozens of seemingly independent businesses tied to the Castro regime.\n\nCuba\u2019s military began investing more aggressively in hotels and other tourist attractions following then-President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement in 2014 that the U.S. government during his tenure would issue the communist Cuban regime extensive financial and diplomatic concessions in exchange for no known benefits to the United States. According to a 2015 report, Gaviota, the military subsidiary, reportedly prepared an expansion aspiring to build 30 new hotels nationwide by 2018. Since President Donald Trump succeeded Obama, however, America has returned to a position of opposition to the regime and increased pressure on government officials to abandon its policy of human rights abuses against pro-democracy dissidents. This has prompted a decline in interest surrounding tourism to the island.\n\nTourism to Cuba for American citizens remains illegal. As the Treasury Department explains, Americans can travel to Cuba for a limited set of activities, including family visits, journalistic activity, and \u201csupport for the Cuban people.\u201d Those who had already reserved rooms at the hotels sanctioned this week will be allowed to transact with those financial entities \u201cprovided that those travel arrangements were initiated prior to the State Department\u2019s addition of the entity or subentity to the list.\u201d\n\nThe sanctions also do not forbid some forms of tourism to the island, such as taking cruises from the United States to the island, if they are described as belonging to one of the proscribed legal categories allowed. The Cuban military does not own the ports where companies like Carnival dock their ships, though the Cuban government does after having stolen many of the docks from their U.S. citizen owners in the 1960s. Cuban-Americans in Florida have begun a campaign to discourage the use of cruises to travel to the island, noting that the companies making the trips are profiting through the use of stolen property.\n\nReports this month suggested that the Trump administration is considering an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FISA) that would allow Americans to sue the Cuban state in court over post-Revolution expropriations.\n\nThe Cuban regime, currently embroiled in a dispute with the incoming conservative government of Brazil over its slave doctor program, has not responded to the American sanctions.

But an email obtained by the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida shows that Florida Democrats were organizing a broader statewide effort beyond those counties to give voters the altered forms to fix improper absentee ballots after the Nov. 5 deadline. Democratic party leaders provided staffers with copies of a form, known as a \u201ccure affidavit,\u201d that had been modified to include an inaccurate Nov. 8 deadline. One Palm Beach Democrat said in an interview the idea was to have voters fix and submit as many absentee ballots as possible with the altered forms in hopes of later including them in vote totals if a judge ruled such ballots were allowed.\n\nElection Day was November 6.\n\nA decision Thursday by federal judge Mark Walker, a Barack Obama appointee, will allow voters to correct mismatched signatures on mailed-in and provisional ballots until Saturday. Republicans have appealed.\n\nRepublicans are already crying foul over Democrats\u2019 efforts to overturn GOP victories in the races for governor and U.S. Senate by suing local election authorities to include votes that were improperly cast (or not cast).\n\nElection officials in Broward County and Palm Beach County failed to comply with state laws and court orders regarding the counting and reporting of outstanding ballots, leading to speculation about efforts to tamper with the results.\n\nDemocrats have countered by claiming that Republicans do not want every vote to be counted.\n\nJoel B.

The report also alleges that Facebook hired a PR firm which published articles critical of Facebook\u2019s competitors through an associated conservative news website. Facebook also reportedly hired a Republican opposition research firm to discredit activist protesters critical of Facebook\u2019s data breaches. This was done partly by linking them to the left-wing financier George Soros.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the New York Times report:\n\n1: Facebook attempted to link protesters to George Soros\n\nFollowing the Cambridge Analytica user data breach in which the personal data of millions of users was allegedly left vulnerable, Facebook attempted to discredit those that were critical of the company\u2019s practices \u2014 by linking them to billionaire left-wing financier George Soros, known for funding a number of far-left groups. The article states:\n\nWhile Mr. Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic. In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms. Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook\u2019s reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.\n\n2: Facebook Hired a PR Company to Publish Articles Critical of Competitors\n\nIn October 2017, Facebook began to increase the level of work for Definers Public Affairs \u2014 a PR group originally been to monitor press coverage of the company \u2014 undertakes for the company. Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush and one of the founders of Definers, previously stated in an interview that a goal for tech firms should be to \u201chave positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that\u2019s being pushed out about your competitor.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Definers did for Facebook. The article states:\n\nOn a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Mr. Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians\u2019 use of Facebook. The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Va. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company\u2019s political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients\u2019 enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.\n\n3: Zuckerberg questioned whether Trump\u2019s immigration comments broke Facebook rules\n\nIn 2015, Donald Trump called for a shutdown of Muslim immigration following a series of Islamic terrorist attacks across the globe.

Family members said they hired Mexican attorneys to obtain those documents.\n\nHowever, El Paso doctors since shared grim news with the family saying Avila suffered \u201csevere brain damage.\u201d They gave the family the choice of pulling Avila off of life support or performing two surgeries that would keep her alive but in a vegetative state, according to the sister.\n\nThe family refuses to give up hope, though, and say they are encouraged by whatever signs of life Avila exhibits such as opening her eyes and moving her hands. They have created a GoFundMe account. It has raised more than $70,000 of a $150,000 goal.\n\nFamily members said they hope to move Avila to a Dallas hospital.\n\nOnline, Rino Center advertised a nose job at $18,000 pesos, approximately $885 U.S. dollars. Last year, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimated the average price for a nose job at $5,125 before factoring in anesthesia, outpatient operating room facilities, and other related expenses. In total, a U.S. rhinoplasty can range from approximately $6,000 to $15,000, according to Allure Magazine.\n\nExperts at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso told KFOX the requirements to become a plastic surgeon in Mexico differ from those in the United States. It takes around 16 years of extensive medical training to become an American plastic surgeon.\n\n\u201c[In Mexico], they do fewer years in terms of sub-specialty training.

Basically, should Nelson win every single lawsuit he has filed, should he win this legal \u201croyal flush,\u201d as a Politico source put it, he would still come up short:\n\nAs of the most recent update, only 7,871 absentee ballots were rejected statewide due to \u201cvoter error,\u201d which could include mismatched signatures on the ballots compared with what\u2019s on file with the state. And of them, 35 percent were cast by Republicans, 36 percent by Democrats and 29 percent by independents. Another 10,186 ballots were rejected because their envelopes were unsigned. Of them, 31 percent were cast by Republicans, 44 percent by Democrats and 24 percent by independents. So if all those ballots were counted, Nelson would have to win 85 percent of them statewide in an election where he couldn\u2019t get 50 percent of the vote so far. On Wednesday, the state\u2019s elections division director provided more specificity when she testified in Nelson\u2019s signature mismatch suit by revealing that 3,688 mail-in absentee ballots and another 93 provisional ballots were rejected for mismatches by 45 counties, a count that didn\u2019t include the large counties of Miami-Dade or Duval.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, according to Politico, even if the so-called undervote (the difference between those who voted for governor and senator) in infamous Broward County really is some sort of counting error, even if 26,105 voters were not counted and now are, there are still not enough to overcome that 12,000 margin.\n\nAs far as the Florida governor\u2019s race, Republican DeSantis enjoys a 34,000 vote lead over Democrat Andrew Gillum. Because that margin is 0.42 percent, the recount will be a machine recount. The margin in the senate race is below 0.25 percent, o that will be a hand recount.\n\nThe deadline for the machine recount is 3 p.m. Thursday. If the margin in the governor\u2019s race stays above 0.25 percent after the machine recount, the recount is over and DeSantis will be certified the winner.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

America\u2019s military superiority\u2014the hard-power backbone of its global influence and national security\u2014has eroded to a dangerous degree\u2026America\u2019s ability to defend its allies, its partners, and its own vital interests is increasingly in doubt. If the nation does not act promptly to remedy these circumstances, the consequences will be grave and lasting. \u2026 The U.S. military could suffer unacceptably high casualties and loss of major capital assets in its next conflict. It might struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or Russia. The United States is particularly at risk of being overwhelmed should its military be forced to fight on two or more fronts simultaneously.\n\nIn February of last year, Gen. Daniel Allyn, vice chief of staff of the Army, sounded the alarm declaring that only three (about five percent) of the 58 U.S. Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) are capable of immediately joining the fight in the event of a major conflict.\n\nThe bipartisan commission identified Iran, North Korea, Russia, China, transnational criminal groups, and terrorist organizations as top threats facing the United States.\n\nEchoing other assessments, the analysts attributed the problems facing the U.S. military\u2019s capability and readiness to \u201cpolitical dysfunction,\u201d the effects of the bipartisan Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011, also known as sequestration, and years of failing to adopt Pentagon appropriations on time.\n\nUnder the BCA, the U.S. substantially slashed defense spending \u201cwith pronounced detrimental effects on the size, modernization, and readiness of the military,\u201d the report noted.\n\n\u201cThe commission argued that despite a $716 billion American defense budget this year, which is four times the size of China\u2019s and more than 10 times that of Russia, the effort to reshape the U.S. defense establishment to counter current threats is under-resourced,\u201d the Washington Post reported. \u201cIt recommended that Congress lift budget caps on defense spending in the next two years that in the past have hobbled the military\u2019s ability to plan for the long term.\u201d\n\nSimilar to the findings of Wednesday\u2019s report, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2019 Index of U.S. Military Strength determined that the U.S. military is only \u201cmarginally able\u201d to defend America against the current high levels of risk primarily fueled by \u201cformidable\u201d rivals like China and Russia.\n\nIn April, Adm. Harry Harris, then-chief of U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), cautioned lawmakers that China\u2019s \u201cimpressive military buildup\u201d may soon enable the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) to challenge America\u2019s military dominance in the Indo-Pacific region \u201cacross almost all domains.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo counter Russia and China, the commission said the Navy should expand its submarine fleet and sealift forces,\u201d the Post revealed, adding that \u201cthe Air Force should introduce more reconnaissance platforms and stealth long-range fighters and bombers; and the Army should pursue more armor, long-range precision missiles and air-defense and logistical forces.\u201d\n\nDouglas Loverro, the former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, cautioned early this year that the Chinese and Russian armed forces had eclipsed their American counterparts in developing some significant war-fighting capabilities in space.\n\nThe commission noted:\n\nBecause of our recent focus on counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency, and because our enemies have developed new ways of defeating U.S. forces, America is losing its advantage in key war fighting areas such as power projection, air and missile defense, cyber and space operations, anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare, long-range ground-based fires, and electronic warfare. Many of the skills necessary to plan for and conduct military operations against capable adversaries\u2014especially China and Russia\u2014 have atrophied.\n\nIn April 2017, Gen. Gen. John Hyten, the head of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), told lawmakers that the U.S. is facing \u201csignificant challenges\u201d sustaining its defense capabilities, both in the nuclear and conventional realm, and is at risk of no longer holding a military advantage over its enemies.\n\nThe commission \u201cadvocated seeing through the modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and putting a top Pentagon official in charge of developing additional air and missile defenses,\u201d the Post pointed out.\n\nAlthough the commission endorses the aim of Trump\u2019s strategy, it cautioned that the U.S is not moving fast enough or investing enough money to put the president\u2019s vision into practice.\n\nThe commission makes 32 recommendations, urging the Pentagon to explain more clearly how it intends to combat major-power rivals.\n\nIt blasted Trump\u2019s National Defense Strategy for relying at times on \u201cquestionable assumptions and weak analysis\u201d and leaving \u201cunanswered critical questions.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Trent Baker", "title": "Michelle Obama: \u2018How Dare Someone Tell Me I Don\u2019t Love My Country\u2019", "description": "In a sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey as part of her book tour, former first lady Michelle Obama discussed on Tuesday life in the White House.

But many of you didn\u2019t believe me because you were too busy running round like headless chickens and throwing your toys out of your prams and yelling at me for being taken in by the beguiling words of Tory toffs.\n\nWell here\u2019s my answer to the last accusation:\n\nAll hail the Moggfather! https://t.co/O9uuf8Za4G \u2014 James Delingpole (@JamesDelingpole) November 15, 2018\n\nThat\u2019ll be Jacob Rees-Mogg, the man so many of you doubted, elegantly thrusting his stiletto between the Prime Minister\u2019s ribs just moments after having declared her to be \u201cunquestionably honourable.\u201d\n\n(Students of Shakespeare may recall that Mark Antony performs a similar trick in Julius Caesar, praising Brutus as an \u201chonourable man\u201d in the Forum the better to inflame the wrath of the mob against him.)\n\nCometh the hour, cometh the man. Rees-Mogg is a man of his word and has done what he said on my podcast he was going to do: bide his time, not get distracted by the little things, and strike when it matters. That\u2019s how Old Etonians roll. They\u2019re endlessly, beguilingly charming until suddenly they are not.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t just an exciting moment for the Mogg: It\u2019s H-Hour for Brexiteers generally.\n\nFor months, years actually \u2013 ever since June 24 2016 \u2013 we\u2019ve been enduring a Phoney War in which the Remain camp (led by the Prime Minister herself) and the Brexit camp have been squaring up to one another, manoeuvring behind their lines, each waiting for the other side to make their move. For us helpless onlookers it has been hugely frustrating. \u201cWhy won\u2019t those useless tossers do something?\u201d we\u2019ve all been screaming from the wings.\n\nIf it has been bad for us civilians, though, imagine how much harder it has been for those on the front line. I\u2019m thinking particularly of all the pro-Brexit MPs who staked their political careers on a matter of principle, supporting a cause \u2013 Brexit \u2013 that all the experts and the bookies said was doomed to defeat. Then, against all odds, they won the referendum. And what was their reward? Why, largely to be marginalised by Theresa May and her Remain-dominated Cabinet, as members of the awkward squad who\u2019d better be on their very best behaviour and do as they were told or they\u2019d be out of government like a shot.\n\nDo you honestly think that these Brexit MPs \u2013 who, remember, made far greater a personal commitment to the Brexit cause than most of us normies did \u2013 haven\u2019t been yearning as desperately as any of us have for May to do the right thing and deliver full Brexit? Do you really imagine they haven\u2019t been every bit as maddened by her intransigence as the rest of us?\n\nTheir problem hasn\u2019t been lack of will. It has been timing: when to strike for maximum impact and in such a way as to be sure that they\u2019re not going to do more harm than good by ending up accidentally securing Theresa May\u2019s power base and letting her get away with blue murder.\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to understand the complexities of votes of no confidence, of the mechanisms within the Tory party for defenestrating a Prime Minister, or indeed, all those questions about the \u201cparliamentary arithmetic\u201d needed to flush May\u2019s glitter-rolled turd of a Brexit plan down the toilet of history.\n\nNor, I suspect, do most of you.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you who do. Jacob Rees-Mogg and his fellow Brexiteer MPs. They\u2019ve been thinking about these details long and hard because their careers depend on it and because they don\u2019t want to go down in history as the idiots who flunked the opportunity of extricating their country from the most disastrous relationship since Henry VIII met Anne Boleyn.\n\nAgain, I\u2019d stress, it\u2019s perfectly possible that they\u2019ve judged this wrong and that Theresa May is going to stay in power and that Britain is going to remain an emasculated satrapy of the overweening European superstate.\n\nJudging by the fast-moving events of today, though, I\u2019d say that Theresa May is toast as Prime Minister and that we\u2019re very much on course for the best kind of Brexit we can probably hope for at this stage: a No Deal Brexit, on World Trade Organisation trading terms, with no obligation whatsoever (though we will) to pay anything close to the \u00a339 billion Theresa May\u2019s crap negotiators have even offering in order to buy us out.\n\nThis is a big day for Britain \u2013 the most exciting and significant since the EU referendum.\n\nIt reminds me of old wartime footage of fighter pilots waiting uneasily at their aerodromes on the South East coast of England, some lounging in deck chairs trying to concentrate on a book, some smoking pipes or playing ball games, but all preoccupied with something else entirely\u2026\n\n\u2026then the bell rings. \u201cScramble! Scramble!\u201d And they hurry to their waiting Spitfires and Hurricanes.\n\nChocks away. Tally ho, chaps! The battle to save Britain from yet another continental menace has begun."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Breitbart News, Breitbart News", "title": "\u2018Little House on the Prairie\u2019 Star Katherine MacGregor Dead at 93", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Katherine MacGregor, who played petty, gossiping mother Harriet Oleson on TV\u2019s \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\u201d has died, a representative said Wednesday.

I never will strike a woman,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI am looking forward to a full investigation, at which point I am confident that I will be fully exonerated.\u201d\n\nThe case will likely deal a fatal blow to Avenatti\u2019s presidential ambitions, with the 47-year-old previously claiming that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d beat Donald Trump in a 2020 run-off. According to polling data released this week before the allegations emerged, zero percent of Democrats said they want him as their nominee.\n\nIt is not the first time that Milano, who has become one of Hollywood\u2019s leading anti-Trump activists, has chosen to disavow figures on the left. Just last week, Milano distanced herself from the Women\u2019s March over its close connections to the anti-Semitic activist Louis Farrakhan.\n\n\u201cAny time that there is any bigotry or anti-Semitism in that respect, it needs to be called out and addressed,\u201d she said in an interview with The Advocate. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in the leadership of the Women\u2019s March that they haven\u2019t done it adequately.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Victoria Friedman", "title": "\u2018Worst Deal in History\u2019: Every Minister Who Has Resigned over May\u2019s Soft Brexit", "description": "Ministerial resignations are flying in Thursday morning in response to the prime minister's draft agreement with the EU, deemed the \"worst deal in history\" by Brexit leader Nigel Farage.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/11/15/worst-deal-in-history-every-minister-who-has-resigned-over-mays-soft-brexit/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/Theresa-May-2.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:51:27Z", "content": "Breitbart London lists the ministers who have resigned on November 15th in response to May\u2019s draft Brexit deal with the European Union: Ranil Jayawardena, Parliamentary Private Secretary Writing in his resignation letter to the prime minister Thursday afterno\u2026 [+4798 chars]", "fulltext": "Seven MPs have resigned from their posts in response to the prime minister\u2019s draft agreement with the EU, deemed the \u201cworst deal in history\u201d by Brexit leader Nigel Farage.\n\nBreitbart London lists the ministers who have resigned on Thursday, November 15th, in response to May\u2019s draft Brexit deal with the European Union:\n\nRehman Chishti, Tory Party Vice-Chairman\n\nThe MP for Gillingham and Rainham said the deal did not deliver the promises made to the British people in the Tory party\u2019s manifesto \u2013 that leaving would mean leaving the Customs Union and the Single Market.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Chishti wrote: \u201cThe terms of the backstop in effect amount in my view to a hybrid membership of the EU customs union and single market and further the EU would have a veto over our ability to exit.\n\n\u201cThe UK in effect will be a part of a system where it will be a rule taker without any say on the rules.\u201d\n\nRanil Jayawardena, Parliamentary Private Secretary\n\nWriting in his resignation letter to the prime minister Thursday afternoon, Mr Jayawardena said: \u201cI cannot agree, in the cold light of day, that the deal in front of us today is right for our country.

Your answer to this question likely depends on whether the cost of your healthcar\u2026 [+4238 chars]", "fulltext": "The following post is sponsored by Liberty HealthShare.\n\nThe American healthcare system has gone through countless changes in the last decade. But have these changes made the healthcare system better or worse for the average American?\n\nYour answer to this question likely depends on whether the cost of your healthcare has gone up. On one hand, the Individual Mandate has been revised, eliminating any tax penalties for not having health insurance. On the other hand, the cost of paying for healthcare continues to rise. So how can Americans find a way to afford healthcare costs?\n\nThe promise that health insurance companies try to sell Americans is that they can live without worrying about how they\u2019ll pay for medical bills if they get sick or injured. But anyone who has ever had one of these programs knows that when you do get sick or injured you have to worry not only about the care you need to receive , but also whether you\u2019ll be able to afford it. This has led to a trend of more and more people moving in a different direction when it comes to how they pay for their healthcare.\n\nWhat Americans need is an affordable way to pay for healthcare. A way to take control of their own healthcare , that allows them to choose the doctor they need, not the one that is on a list. A way that allows them to join (or leave) a program whenever they want or need. A way that allows members to know where their money is spent and what it is being spent on. And perhaps most importantly, a way that is focused on keeping costs down for members.\n\nDoes that sound too good to be true? Well, it\u2019s not. In fact, that way to pay for healthcare already exists. It\u2019s called healthcare sharing .\n\nYou may not know much about healthcare sharing and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a relatively new concept to most Americans. Healthcare sharing is everything listed above and more, and it\u2019s available to everyone. The concept has been around since the 1980s, but has rapidly grown in popularity since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, thanks to an exemption written into the law. This exemption allowed Americans to be a member of one of these programs instead of a healthcare program offered on the Exchange, without facing a tax penalty.\n\nIf you were to research healthcare sharing, you would quickly realize that, much like any industry, there are a lot of organizations competing with each other. One organization that has set itself apart from all the others is Liberty HealthShare . This organization has managed to grow to one of the largest healthcare sharing organizations by giving its members exactly what they want: affordability, choice of doctors, transparency on how their money is being spent, and freedom from government regulation.\n\nLiberty HealthShare aims to return freedom to their members without network restrictions. Liberty HealthShare gives members the ability to take charge of their own healthcare. This includes not only the costs, but also decisions on which doctors they see, what procedures they have done, and which hospitals they visit.\n\nPeople use healthcare sharing for several reasons, including lower costs, the ability to choose your own doctor, and freedom to make your own healthcare decisions . Another key reason why so many people are part of healthcare sharing is the ability to help others. With every monthly payment, a member\u2019s money goes to help others pay their medical costs. Without a community of people coming together to lend a hand to each other, members would be subject to the continually rising costs of the healthcare industry.\n\nWhile the debate will continue regarding whether the American healthcare system as a whole has improved or regressed in the last decade, one thing is certain. The healthcare system that the majority of Americans are familiar with may still be a troubled and complex system, but one program available to all Americans offers an affordable way to pay for their healthcare . It offers healthcare that returns freedom to the consumer."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Dr. Susan Berry", "title": "Sarah Silverman Leads Hollywood Women Promoting \u2018Shout Your Abortion\u2019 Book", "description": "Hollywood women, from Sarah Silverman to Amy Brenneman, are gathering to celebrate the release of a new coffee table book that urges women to boast about having an abortion.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/11/15/sarah-silverman-leads-hollywood-women-promoting-shout-your-abortion-book/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/07/Sarahsilverman1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:47:29Z", "content": "LOS ANGELES this Friday 11/16 join me and @AmyBrenneman and other marvels at @shoutyourabortions book party GET TIX HERE https://t.co/WqPjRDRpn0 \u2014 Sarah Wine-Thyre \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udff3\ud83c\udf08 (@SarahThyre) November 13, 2018 Actresses, Sarah Silverman, Sarah Wine-Thyre, Amy Bren\u2026 [+3258 chars]", "fulltext": "Hollywood women, from Sarah Silverman to Amy Brenneman, are gathering to celebrate the release of a new coffee table book that urges women to boast about having an abortion.\n\nLOS ANGELES this Friday 11/16 join me and @AmyBrenneman and other marvels at @shoutyourabortion\u2019s book party GET TIX HERE https://t.co/WqPjRDRpn0 \u2014 Sarah Wine-Thyre \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@SarahThyre) November 13, 2018\n\nActresses, Sarah Silverman, Sarah Wine-Thyre, Amy Brenneman and other \u201cmarvels\u201d are inviting their fans to join them for a #ShoutYourAbortion book party Friday night at the Hollywood Improv, tweeted Wine-Thyre.\n\nHave you got your tickets for @ShoutYrAbortion\u2019s book tour yet?

He is certainly being criticized for not handling the trade relationship well, and so I think he doesn\u2019t want to be criticized as also not handling the security side of the relationship well,\u201d she added.\n\nThe military-to-military relationship is typically the first thing to go when relations between two countries sour. It happened between the U.S. and Russia in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2014. It last happened between the U.S. and China, for two years after the U.S. signed a $6 billion arms deal with Taiwan in 2010.\n\nThere have been no shortage of tense moments between the U.S. and Chinese military in recent months.\n\nIn September, the U.S. sanctioned the Chinese Defense Ministry under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for purchasing Russian military equipment. In response, China recalled the commander of its navy from the U.S., where he was planning to meet with the U.S. Navy\u2019s top commander, and rejected a U.S. Navy request for a port visit in Hong Kong.\n\nThen, the U.S. angered China by flying U.S. bombers through the East and South China Seas. A Chinese warship then came within 45 yards of the U.S. destroyer USS Decatur while it was sailing through the South China Sea. Sometime amidst these events, China canceled Mattis\u2019 meeting with a high-ranking Chinese military official in Beijing, prompting Mattis to cancel his trip altogether.\n\nDespite the tit-for-tat, China lobbied hard to get the military relationship on track.\n\nThe military-to-military relationship \u201cis very important to them,\u201d the senior defense official said.\n\nExperts and officials say they do not expect China to change its behavior on the security front, but China\u2019s desire for a stable military relationship could mean the Pentagon can press Beijing harder to establish a way to deconflict \u2014 or avoid mishaps \u2014 when U.S. ships are operating in the contested regions.\n\n\u201cMaybe there is more space to have a dialogue on how we deconflict operations in the South China Sea. Maybe there is a potential for getting the Chinese to agree more on how we implement these agreed-upon rules of the road because we already have them so that we avoid accidents,\u201d Glaser said.\n\n\u201cBut even that is uncertain\u2026because I do think Xi Jinping is under pressure to show that he can defense Chinese sovereignty but is not going to look soft on the United States,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Pentagon has sought to make challenging China\u2019s excessive maritime claims a regular and less contentious occurrence.\n\nOne of Mattis\u2019 earliest actions on the job was to approve a plan to regularly challenge those claims in the South China Sea. Breitbart News first reported that Mattis had drawn up a plan to have U.S. Navy war ships sail by contested islands in the South China Sea on a regular basis to contest China\u2019s territorial claims, called Freedom of Navigation operations (FONOPs).\n\nAccording to Reuters, there have been six FONOPs in the South China Sea between September 30, 2017, through September 30, 2018 \u2014 the equivalent to what occurred under the last two years of the Obama administration.\n\nIn another change, the Pentagon has also begun publicizing the transit of U.S. warships through the Taiwan Strait, as Breitbart News also first reported. This year, the U.S. confirmed sending two warships through the strait, the first time it has confirmed doing so since the Bush administration sent an aircraft carrier through in 2007.\n\nThe Trump administration has also sought to regularize arms sales to Taiwan, by approving smaller and more frequent sales, versus bundling them in larger and less frequent packages. Also in September, the State Department approved an arms sale of $330 million to Taiwan.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, the Pentagon identified China as a great power competitor in its National Defense Strategy, which is guiding the decision-making on everything from budgets to training.\n\nThe Chinese have reacted angrily to these challenges. At the State Department on Friday, the Chinese foreign minister said he \u201cmade it clear\u201d to the U.S. that it should stop sending ships and aircraft close to \u201cChinese Islands\u201d in the South China Sea.\n\nBut the Pentagon has no intentions of relenting. Trump administration officials have tried to make it clear to the Chinese that \u201ccompetition does not mean conflict.\u201d\n\nLater, in his meeting with Wei at the Pentagon, Mattis reiterated the U.S.\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cBoth agreed that the military relationship could be a stabilizing factor in the overall bilateral relationship,\u201d a Pentagon readout of their meeting said.\n\n\u201cSecretary Mattis also raised the importance of all maritime forces conducting their operations in a safe and professional manner in accordance with international standards and norms. The Secretary and the Minister agreed to continue progress on a crisis communications and deconfliction framework to reduce risk.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Jeff Poor", "title": "Graham: \u2018President Trump Is Not Going to Fire Mueller\u2019", "description": "Wednesday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cHannity,\u201d Sen.

Senator, we have a lot of important judicial appointments. We have the threat by Jeff Flake tonight about protecting Mueller. And I know you said that is fine, but the president said he has no intention of firing Mueller. It looks like some agreement has been made by the reports I read, between the president\u2019s lawyers and the special counsel, written answers. That would mean this is now coming to an end, at least in my mind.\n\nGRAHAM: Well, this is a manufactured problem. President Trump is not going to fire Mueller. Mueller is going to be allowed to do his job. And we need conservative judges on the bench, as many as we can, as often as we can get them.\n\nI don\u2019t know what Senator Grassley is going to do. He\u2019s been a great chairman of the committee. If I\u2019m chairman next chairman, we are going to do judges, judges, and more judges.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, I am convinced that Mr. Mueller will be allowed to do his job. I\u2019ve not seen one scintilla of evidence of collusion. The obstruction of justice thing never made any sense to me. You can fire somebody who works as a political employment, the FBI director can be fired for almost any reason. And the Democrats wanted Comey fired.\n\nSo, I feel good about everything right now."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Breitbart Jerusalem", "title": "Watch: Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon Plays Rocket Siren at U.N.", "description": "Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon,\u00a0 played a recording of a \u201cCode Red\u201d rocket siren to the media ahead of a Security Council debate\u00a0on the escalation of anti-Israel terrorist violence.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2018/11/15/watch-israeli-ambassador-danny-danon-plays-rocket-siren-at-u-n/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/danny-danon.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:23:32Z", "content": "\u201cEvery time Hamas shoots a rocket \u2013 children at school, adults at work, families all over the country hear this,\u201d Danon said as the \u201cRed Alert\u201d air raid siren playing from a phone. \u201cThink of the children running fearfully into bomb shelters,\u201d he continued. \u201cC\u2026 [+1735 chars]", "fulltext": "Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, played a recording of a \u201cCode Red\u201d rocket siren to the media ahead of a Security Council debate on the escalation of anti-Israel terrorist violence.\n\n\u201cEvery time Hamas shoots a rocket \u2013 children at school, adults at work, families all over the country hear this,\u201d Danon said as the \u201cRed Alert\u201d air raid siren playing from a phone.\n\n\u201cThink of the children running fearfully into bomb shelters,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cCertain morally bankrupt members of the Security Council will jump to blame Israel, and others who pretend to be objective will call for restraint on both sides.

Pelosi\u2019s allies are reportedly trying to convince anti-Pelosi Democrats and perhaps even some Republicans to vote \u201cpresent\u201d on the House floor to lower the number of votes she would need to win. Since Pelosi just needs a majority of Democrats to be nominated for Speaker, her nomination is hardly in doubt.\n\nAnti-Pelosi Democrats told HuffPost that they believe even more Democrats could sign the letter but are hesitant to announce their intentions at the moment. HuffPost noted that the anti-Pelosi faction is \u201cworking to gather as many names as possible as quick as possible, as they believe the longer they remain in the shadows, the more likely it is that Pelosi could flip some of their members.\u201d\n\nPelosi and her allies have been trying to use the gender card to lock up her bid to take back her Speakership, but Fudge\u2019s candidacy would make the gender argument less powerful.\n\nIn addition, after an election cycle in which Democrats elected black candidates like Andrew Gillum in and Stacey Abrams in primaries and energized its left-wing base, Fudge is also reportedly \u201cdismayed that neither of the party\u2019s two top leaders\u201d is a person of color. She also reportedly added that an African-American woman should be in the party\u2019s leadership, especially when black women have been the backbone of the party for so long.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the people who support this party the most, they are women and African Americans and especially African American women,\u201d Fudge reportedly added. \u201cWe keep talking about diversity, but there is nothing diverse about the top of our ticket.

Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), Kurt Schrader (D-OR), Seth Moulton (D-MA), and Filemon Vela (D-TX) have publicly declared their opposition to Pelosi this week, with Schrader reportedly going on the record to say the group has enough votes to \u201censure that she cannot become speaker.\u201d\n\nPelosi has been going on a full-court press in recent days to lock up her Speakership, meeting with top union leaders, progressive Democrats, and the extremely important Congressional Black Caucus on Wednesday. Publicly, Pelosi has confidently insisted that she \u201cwill be the speaker of the House no matter what\u201d her critics like Moulton have been saying.\n\nBut Mikie Sherrill, a new Democrat who got elected in New Jersey by telling voters that she would oppose Pelosi, told the Washington Post on Wednesday that she expects plenty of Democrats to emerge and ultimately challenge Pelosi, implying that she believes Pelosi may not make it past the first ballot.\n\n\u201cI think there are some great people that will be coming forward, and I\u2019m excited to see who those people might be,\u201d Sherrill reportedy said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t identified themselves yet, but we have such a deep bench of talent in the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nVeteran Democrats, including Schrader, though, are warning that Pelosi, a legendary vote-counter, should not be underestimated.

While there was widespread speculation that she might have been announcing her standing down from the leadership \u2014 possibly to fight re-election by Conservative members to confirm her mandate \u2014 it quickly became clear this speech was meant to signal her grim determination to push on with her Brexit plan. She said:\n\nServing in High Office is an honour and privilege. It is also a heavy responsibility that is true at any time, but especially when the stakes are so high. And negotiating an exit of the EU after 40 years and building from the ground up a new and enduring relationship for our children and grandchildren is a matter of the highest consequence. It touches almost every area of our national life. Our whole economy and virtually every job. The livelihood of our fellow citizens, our integrity as a United Kingdom of our four nations, our safety and security \u2014 all of these are at stake. My approach throughout has been to put the national interest first \u2014 not a partisan interest and certainly not my own political interest. I do not judge those harshly those of my colleagues who seek to do the same but who reach a different conclusion. They must do what they believe to be right, just as I do. I\u2019m sorry that they\u2019ve chosen to leave the government, and I thank them for their service. But I believe with every fibre of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for the country and all our people. From the very beginning I\u2019ve known what I wanted to deliver for the British people. To honour they vote in the referendum: full control of the borders by bringing an end to the free movement of people once and for all. Full control of our money so we decide ourselves how to spend it on priorities like our NHS. Full control of our laws by ending the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK, getting us out of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries policy for good. That is exactly what this agreement will deliver. Free movement ended. Payments, stopped. The jurisdiction of the ECJ, over. Out of the CAP, out of the CFP. This is the brexit that delivers on the priority of the British people. In achieving these objectives, I\u2019m also protecting the things that are important to us. Protect the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. Those jobs rely on cross border trade and goods. This agreement protects that. Protect the close security cooperation that keeps us safe. This agreement does that. Protect the integrity of the United Kingdom \u2014 this agreement does that as well. Yes difficult and sometimes uncomfortable decisions have been made. I understand fully that there are some who are unhappy with those compromises, but this deal delivers what the people voted for and is in the national interest. We can only secure it if we unite behind the agreement reached in cabinet yesterday. If we do not move forward with the agreement nobody will know the consequences that will follow. It would be to take a path of great uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it. That is what we owe to them to deliver.\n\nUpdate 1730 \u2014 Theresa May defends her Brexit deal to the country\n\nThe Prime Minister said she was sorry that her colleagues felt they had to resign but is doubling down on her plan, insisting \u201cThis deal delivers what people have voted for it and it is in the national interest.\u201d Looks very clearly that she doesn\u2019t believe she is going anywhere.\n\n\u201cAm I going to see this through?

Noting the conservative party has a \u201cstream\u201d of top talent for the job, while answering questions outside the Houses of Parliament Thursday afternoon he namechecked several parliamentary colleagues, many of whom have recently resigned from cabinet \u2014 and one who hasn\u2019t.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Conservative party is lucky to be full of talent and there are many, many people [who could lead]\u2026 you\u2019ve got Boris Johnson and David Davis. You\u2019ve got Dominic Raab and Esther McVey. You\u2019ve got Penny Mordaunt\u2026 you have streams of talent within the Conservative party who would be very capable of leading a proper Brexit.\u201d\n\nMr Rees-Mogg said that while it was possible to try further negotiation and to make an offering to the European Union, all legislation needed to get Britain out had already been passed in parliament and the country was ready to leave unilaterally. This had many benefits, he said, remarking:\n\n\u201c\u2026we will move straight to WTO terms, we will be a third country, and we will operate on that basis. The basis on which we operate with the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cBear in mind that only seven per cent of the world\u2019s population lives in the European Union. So dealing with the rest of the population of the world is very important.\n\n\u201cBut I do think it would be sensible to make a generous offer to the EU on EU nationals rights in this country, in money for a transition implementation period, so I think there are things that can be offered and it would be wise to offer.\u201d\n\nMore on this development follows\u2026\n\nUpdate 1305 \u2014 Raab Speaks to the BBC\n\nBrexit secretary Dominic Raab has given his first interview since resigning the cabinet, and while saying little his remarks seem to support claims made in Westminster in the past 48 hours that he as Brexit secretary had little to do with the deal itself, and didn\u2019t even see it until the cabinet got copies yesterday.

Asking why exactly he shouldn\u2019t do his part to bring about a leadership contest by putting a letter to Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 backbench committee which is the Conservative party\u2019s own peculiar method of deciding that, he said:\n\nMy right honourable friend \u2014 and she is unquestionably honourable \u2014 said that we would leave hte Customs Union. Annex two says otherwise. My right honourable friend said that she would maintain the integrity of the United Kingdom. A whole protocol says otherwise. My right honourable friend said that we would be out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Article 174 says otherwise. As my right honourable friend says, and what my right honourable friend does no longer match, should I not write to my right honourable friend the member for Altringham [Graham Brady], and sail west?\n\nResponding, the Prime Minister said \u201csome difficult decisions had to be made\u2026 because it is important that we do ensure there is no hard border\u201d between Northern Ireland and the European Union. She also appealed to Rees-Mogg to consider the future relationship with the European Union, but offered no advice on whether he should write a letter calling for her resignation.\n\nAll hail the Moggfather! https://t.co/O9uuf8Za4G \u2014 James Delingpole (@JamesDelingpole) November 15, 2018\n\nUpdate 1123 \u2014 Ulster speaks, and it isn\u2019t happy \u2014 \u2018Vassal state\u2019\n\nAn explosive contribution in the chamber from Belfast North MP and DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds. Without the DUP\u2019s 10 votes they lend on the basis of an agreement with Theresa May, the Prime Minister leads a minority government without enough guaranteed votes to pass legislation reliably. He said:\n\nMr Speaker, I could today stand here and take the Prime Minister through the list of promises and pledges she made to this house, and to us privately, about the future of Northern Ireland in the future relationship with the EU. But I fear it would be a waste of time, since she clearly doesn\u2019t listen. Can I clearly say today, that this house now has a clear choice and every member in it, that this house has been left in a position where the choice is subjection to the rules and laws of others who may not have our interests at heart, and for Northern Ireland and our precious Union \u2014 five of those who have resigned today have talked about the threat to the integrity of the Union and I praise them for their integrity for that they have said and done and for their strong actions. \u00a339bn for nothing. The choice is now clear, we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom, or we vote for a vassal state with the breakup of the United Kingdom.\n\nDismissing his concerns, the Prime Minister said the commitments she made remained \u201cabsolutely\u201d, to which Mr Nodd was seen shaking his head in apparent despair. The Prime Minister said she believed she was working to preserve the integrity of the United Kingdom, and that the backstop was not something she or the European Union wished to see activated.\n\nThe choice is now clear.

The government-aided business has been hidden by media and by Democrats who portray the expensively smuggled young migrants as \u201cUnaccompanied Alien Children.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s new border policy seeks to shrink this organized migration by offering a narrow form of asylum to the transported children and youth \u2014 as well as adults \u2014 who illegally cross the border.\n\nThe narrow form of asylum, dubbed \u201cWithholding of Removal\u201d could block the delivery of the children and youths to potential employers, their illegal alien parents, or to other parties. This policy could prevent the cartels\u2019 coyotes from getting paid and shrink the UAC division of the cartels\u2019 trafficking business.\n\nThe new UAC policy is revealed in a November 9 \u201cProcedural Guidance\u201d document to border officers, prepared by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It says border-crossing UACs will \u201cbe barred from asylum eligibility\u201d:\n\nUnaccompanied alien children (UACs) are not subject to credible fear or reasonable fear screening. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232(a)(5)(D). The IFR, by its terms, does not change that. However, the Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States issued on November 9, 2018 renders UACs who cross the international boundary between the United States and Mexico outside of a port of entry and who do not properly present themselves for inspection would be subject to a suspension of entry. Therefore, while such UACs will continue to be processed in accordance with 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 279 and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232, they would per the terms of this proclamation and the IFR be barred from asylum eligibility.\n\nThe policy does not change procedures for UACs who are dropped off at official \u201cports of entry.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s deputies have taken other steps to curb the smuggling of UACs. For example, officials are now conducting checks on the immigration status of U.S. residents who ask the Department of Health and Human Services to let them \u201csponsor\u201d the child or youth in their own homes. Those checks have already begun to deter illegal-migrant parents and labor-brokers from paying the cartels to transport their children or workers to the United States.\n\nTrump celebrates rising wages caused by his growing economy & his immigration curbs.

Removal orders issued against UACs based on a failure to appear at an immigration hearing have risen over 1000 percent since FY 2009.\n\nGangs, such as MS-13, have used the influx of UACs for recruiting opportunities.

According to the defendant\u2019s plea agreement and admissions in court, the defendant, through his company, Haba Corporate Services, contracted to provide labor to Trillium Farms, knowing that the workers were unlawfully present in the United States. He further admitted to knowing that some of the workers were unaccompanied minors who had been coerced or threatened to enter the United States and then housed in an isolated trailer park in Marion, Ohio. In 2013 and 2014, Trillim Farms paid the defendant\u2019s company approximately $6 million for its labor services.\n\nThe U.S. immigration courts are so backlogged with asylum claims that released asylum-seeking migrants can get legal work-permits for two years while they wait for their court hearing.\n\nThe move-countermove battle between migrants, the cartels, Trump\u2019s deputies, voters, business groups, and progressive groups is taking place along the border, in the agencies, the courts, Congress, and the ballot box.

What is our identity? Our identity, if not a common race, ethnicity. In fact, America is a de facto rejection of that. It is fundamentally premised on this notion, \u201cwe are all children of God, we are born, all created equal by our creator, and given equal rights to life, liberty, and to pursue happiness. That is our national identity. It is deeply rooted in morals and values. It, in fact, explains everything this nation has done, internationally and domestically. We should be proud of that identity. We should defend that national identity. Number two, I think most of the viewers watching this program would be shocked to think that my job is to represent Belgium, or my job is to represent \u2014 I have nothing against Belgium. I always pick on Belgium or Luxembourg. They have their own system of government. That doesn\u2019t mean I need to be hostile toward them. And it may be in our national interest to work with them.\n\nI think NATO is in our national interest and is. I think a lot of our alliances are built on that. Our national identity is a nation that believes in equality of all people. It\u2019s what causes us to defend democracy and feed hungry people all over the world. We should be proud of that.

That final number is going to be critical for Democrats\u2019 hopes of securing Pelosi as speaker, as every number extra that Democrats add to the final total is an extra vote Pelosi can afford to lose. If Republicans sweep those nine remaining races, a very unlikely outcome, and Democrats enter the new Congress with 227 votes, Pelosi can only afford to lose nine Democrats on the floor. Democrats, however, are very likely to pick up a number of the nine outstanding seats. They currently lead Republicans in four of them: California\u2019s 10th District, New Jersey\u2019s 3rd District, New York\u2019s 22nd, and Utah\u2019s 4th District. Republicans lead Democrats in the other five: California\u2019s 39th and 45th Districts, and Georgia\u2019s 7th, as well as Maine\u2019s 2nd, and Texas\u2019s 23rd Districts. \u2026 [D]espite Pelosi\u2019s allies pushing the narrative that a challenger to her must emerge, that is not true. They can vote her down, and then most certainly after she would have failed to reach 218 votes on the first ballot on the House floor, then plausible challengers would emerge.\n\nNot only does Pelosi face a tough battle to win over a weary colleague, but a recent poll shows the 78-year-old is losing support among voters.

An independent analyst, Nic Lewis, examined the paper and quickly spotted it was based on flawed math.\n\nAs the Global Warming Policy Forum reported:\n\nIndependent climate scientist Nicholas Lewis has uncovered a major error in a recent scientific paper that was given blanket coverage in the English-speaking media. The paper, written by a team led by Princeton oceanographer Laure Resplandy, claimed that the oceans have been warming faster than previously thought. It was announced, in news outlets including the BBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post and Scientific American that this meant that the Earth may warm even faster than currently estimated. However Lewis, who has authored several peer-reviewed papers on the question of climate sensitivity and has worked with some of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, has found that the warming trend in the Resplandy paper differs from that calculated from the underlying data included with the paper. \u201cIf you calculate the trend correctly, the warming rate is not worse than we thought \u2013 it\u2019s very much in line with previous estimates,\u201d says Lewis. In fact, says Lewis, some of the other claims made in the paper and reported by the media, are wrong too. \u201cTheir claims about the effect of faster ocean warming on estimates of climate sensitivity (and hence future global warming) and carbon budgets are just incorrect anyway, but that\u2019s a moot point now we know that about their calculation error\u201d.\n\nNow, one of the paper\u2019s co-authors, Ralph Keeling has gamely fessed up to the error \u2014 and hinted that this effectively invalidates the paper:\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we made mistakes here,\u201d said Ralph Keeling, a climate scientist at Scripps, who was a co-author of the study. \u201cI think the main lesson is that you work as fast as you can to fix mistakes when you find them.\u201d The central problem, according to Keeling, came in how the researchers dealt with the uncertainty in their measurements. As a result, the findings suffer from too much doubt to definitively support the paper\u2019s conclusion about just how much heat the oceans have absorbed over time. The central conclusion of the study \u2014 that oceans are retaining ever more energy as more heat is being trapped within Earth\u2019s climate system each year \u2014 is in line with other studies that have drawn similar conclusions. And it hasn\u2019t changed much despite the errors. But Keeling said the authors\u2019 miscalculations mean there is actually a much larger margin of error in the findings, which means researchers can weigh in with less certainty than they thought. \u201cI accept responsibility for what happened because it\u2019s my role to make sure that those kind of details got conveyed,\u201d Keeling said.\n\nThere are broader lessons here which \u2014 as so often before \u2014 are likely to be completely lost on the climate alarmist establishment.\n\nOne lesson is that climate skeptics are not scientific ignoramuses. They boast a huge range of independent experts like Nic Lewis who on many occasions have proved themselves more intellectually agile and better informed on climate science than the alarmist \u201cconsensus\u201d gatekeepers in academe and at institutions like NASA and NOAA.\n\nAnother lesson is \u2014 as has been clear since Climategate \u2014 the peer-review system for scientific papers, especially if they have anything to do with climate change, is bust. Too often it is just a pal-review system in which chums on the climate change gravy train pass their colleagues\u2019 work for publication nem con. Such is the appetite among alarmists for \u201cevidence\u201d that supports their doomsday thesis that the scarier it is, the more likely it is to get published.\n\nAnother lesson is that the mainstream media simply cannot be trusted to apply any kind of professional scrutiny to alarmist papers. No environmental correspondent, it\u2019s true, would have had the advanced math skills that Nic Lewis used to find the paper false.\n\nBut the fact remains that there is not one science or environment correspondent attached to any mainstream media publication prepared to do their due diligence on global warming scare stories. They are all so wedded to the alarmist consensus that they scarcely even bother to alter the press release.\n\nFinally, do not expect this humiliating retraction to be given anywhere near the prominence afforded the original story. This is how the climate scare machine works: the hysteria is only ever ratcheted upwards, never dialed down."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Breitbart News", "title": "Watch: Michael Avenatti Released After Domestic Violence Charge", "description": "(AP) \u2014 Michael Avenatti has been released from police custody following his arrest on a felony domestic violence charge in Los Angeles.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/14/michael-avenatti-released-after-domestic-violence-charge/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/aa.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T02:23:39Z", "content": "As he walked out of the police station Wednesday, Avenatti told reporters he has never struck a woman.

The bear was wearing a keffiyeh scarf, associated with the Palestinian cause, and reaching up toward a kite with the colors of the Palestinian flag and three doves. Incendiary kites and balloons have been flown over the Gaza border into Israel since May as a form of terror and the school did not wish to see their mascot or name associated with a logo that could be interpreted \u201cas an intention to endorse violence against Israel,\u201d the request said.\n\nSJP acquiesced to the request and removed the UCLA name from the logo, but said the school\u2019s \u201cracist and gross mischaracterization of our design ignores the fact that kite-flying is a common pastime in Gaza, and has long been a symbol of freedom for Palestinians.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Joshua Caplan, Joshua Caplan", "title": "Michael Avenatti Denies Alleged Domestic Violence Following Arrest", "description": "Avenatti denied allegations of domestic violence following his Wednesday arrest, saying he's never been \"physically abusive in my life.\"", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/14/michael-avenatti-denies-alleged-domestic-violence-following-arrest/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Michael-Avenatti-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T01:58:38Z", "content": "I wish to thank the hard working men and woman of the LAPD for their professionalism they were only doing their jobs in light of the completely bogus allegations against me,\u201d Avenatti said in a statement obtained by BuzzFeed News. \u201cI have never been physicall\u2026 [+376 chars]", "fulltext": "Television lawyer and 2020 Democrat presidential hopeful Michael Avenatti denied allegations of domestic violence against him following his Wednesday arrest, saying he\u2019s never been \u201cphysically abusive in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish to thank the hard working men and woman of the LAPD for their professionalism they were only doing their jobs in light of the completely bogus allegations against me,\u201d Avenatti said in a statement obtained by BuzzFeed News. \u201cI have never been physically abusive in my life nor was I last night.

Only five percent of voters said prison reform was the most pressing issue in the country and only four percent of Trump voters said the same.\n\nMeanwhile, the two most pressing issues among all U.S. voters remain immigration and healthcare. In midterms election exit polling, voters repeatedly said healthcare and immigration were the two issues that drove them to the polls. In swing states, a majority of voters said they support Trump\u2019s nationalist immigration agenda.\n\nNonetheless, the Koch brothers\u2019 agenda has taken priority in the Trump White House as the president\u2019s populist immigration plan \u2014 which includes reducing legal immigration levels and building a border wall \u2014 has taken a back seat.\n\nThough a caravan of migrants heads to the U.S.-Mexico border, there remains no legislative initiative on border security or securing a border wall."}]
