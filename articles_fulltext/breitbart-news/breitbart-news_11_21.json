Not all of these dropped cases can be attributed to immigrants getting off welfare to avoid being chronicled as a \u201cpublic charge\u201d to Americans and thus potentially denied a green card.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the majority of the more than 1.5 million foreign nationals entering the country every year use about 57 percent more food stamps than the average native-born American household. Overall, immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households and 44 percent more in Medicaid dollars. This straining of public services by a booming 44 million foreign-born population translates to the average immigrant household costing American taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Kyle Morris", "title": "Poll: Four in Ten Americans Hope to Avoid Talking Politics on Thanksgiving", "description": "A new poll released on Wednesday shows fewer than two in ten Americans are looking forward to discussing politics at the Thanksgiving dinner table, while four in ten hope to avoid political discussion altogether.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/21/four-in-ten-americans-hope-avoid-talking-politics-thanksgiving/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/Thanksgiving-Table-John-MooreGetty-Images.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T23:32:02Z", "content": "The CBS News poll, conducted by telephone from November 15-18 among 1,103 adults, revealed 15 percent of respondents are \u201clooking forward to\u201d mixing politics with Thanksgiving dinner while 40 percent said, \u201cthey hope to avoid it.\u201d Forty-five percent of respon\u2026 [+845 chars]", "fulltext": "A new poll released on Wednesday shows fewer than two in ten Americans are looking forward to discussing politics at the Thanksgiving dinner table, while four in ten hope to avoid political discussion altogether.\n\nThe CBS News poll, conducted by telephone from November 15-18 among 1,103 adults, revealed 15 percent of respondents are \u201clooking forward to\u201d mixing politics with Thanksgiving dinner while 40 percent said, \u201cthey hope to avoid it.\u201d Forty-five percent of respondents to the survey say they \u201cdon\u2019t care either way.\u201d\n\nThe poll found 37 percent of Republicans and 40 percent of Democrats hoping to avoid political discussions this Thanksgiving.

(Four of the accused still face federal conspiracy and obstructions charges that could see them behind bars for decades if convicted when the case goes to trial next April, according to the Detroit Free Press.)\n\nEuropean countries have been battling with the imported problem of FGM for decades, with varying degrees of success. Britain\u2019s failures may present a window into the pitfalls lawmakers may face until a robust, American, response to the abuse is taken:\n\n1) Passing an anti-FGM law is only half the battle.\n\nBritain outlawed FGM in 1985, with new laws and requirements strengthening that legislation in 2003 and 2015. Yet there has never been a single successful prosecution.\n\nWhile some doctors have been struck off the medical register for advising on or performing the procedure \u2014 banning them from practising as medical professionals \u2014 not one single case was brought to trial in the UK until 2015. However, the trial collapsed and the doctor involved was acquitted.\n\nThe second ever prosecution \u2014 against a father accused or arranging his daughter\u2019s genitals to be cut \u2014 collapsed in March 2018.\n\nOfficial figures by Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) revealed that last year there were 4,495 new cases of FGM in the preceding 12 months \u2014 the equivalent of one girl cut every two hours, 24 hours a day for a whole year.\n\nThose victims represent only one part of the total of 28,326 cases recorded in just three years since law required medical professionals report FGM to the police when they encountered patients who had been mutilated.\n\nStill, that is only a fraction of estimate 137,000 women and child victims believed to be in England overall. One-third of the victims were born in Somalia, according to NHS data.\n\nDespite Dr Nagarwal\u2019s case being the first, it will likely not be the last in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that more than 500,000 women and girls in the U.S. are at risk of or have been subjected to FGM.\n\nAnother Female Genital Mutilation Case Fails, Zero Convictions in 33 Years https://t.co/iLQ0aUfkIM \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2018\n\n2) Do not underestimate the power of Political Correctness.\n\nWhile the Department of Justice has said that it is \u201ccommitted\u201d to stopping FGM in the U.S., British police have provided mixed messages over what is more important: protecting children or avoiding offence.\n\nBreitbart London reported in 2017 that West Midlands Police said that prosecuting FGM was not a priority for the force as it was \u201cunlikely to benefit the child,\u201d saying their focus was \u201ceducating and safeguarding vulnerable girls.\u201d\n\nPolice prioritising community outreach over prosecution has also become a target for Britain\u2019s largest police force, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police. In July 2018, FGM lead Inspector Allen Davis stressed the importance of \u201chaving conversations\u201d with the immigrant community for whom \u201ccommunity ties\u201d and practices are paramount.\n\nWhile British police have appeared to take a soft approach to community relations, Surrey Police did not hesitate to threaten the public over \u201cIslamophobic\u201d tweets on Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Day in February.\n\nSurrey Police told Breitbart London that no arrests of those suspected of facilitating or committing FGM were made on Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Day \u2014 but had said that \u201cIslamophobic\u201d tweets were passed onto their \u201cintelligence teams\u201d for investigation.\n\nUK Police Threaten Public over \u2018Islamophobic\u2019 Tweets on FGM Awareness Day\u2026 Despite ZERO FGM Convictions https://t.co/H4FefzFvFu \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2018\n\n3) European \u2014 and American \u2014 Islamic clerics have defended FGM.\n\nThe strongest voices in favour of female genital mutilation will often come from those whose voices carry the most weight in the \u2018community.\u2019\n\nIn February, Breitbart London reported that the Islamic Central Council of Switzerland (IZRS) had defended FGM, saying that it is justified under Islamic law \u2014 despite the practice being illegal in Switzerland since 2012.\n\nAli Selim, a spokesman for the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland, also said that FGM was permissible in Islam because of a saying by the Muslim prophet Mohammed, and claimed that \u201cfemale circumcision\u201d was different and acceptable. FGM has also been illegal in the Republic of Ireland for 12 years.\n\nIn the United States, an imam at a Virginia mosque reportedly said that FGM prevents \u201chypersexuality\u201d in women, and unless she is \u201ccircumcised,\u201d a woman is not \u201csatisfied with one person or two or three.\u201d\n\n4) What do you do when girls are taken abroad for mutilation?\n\nThe CDC advises that while victims are being cut in the U.S., victims are also sent abroad for the procedure.\n\nIn the UK, parents taking their daughters back to their countries of origin to have their genitals cut during the school summer holidays has become known as \u201ccutting season.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Britain, 86 per cent of FGM cases where the details are known were undertaken in an African country, with young girls frequently taken abroad during school vacation for a \u201choliday\u201d by relatives to be cut.\n\nBritish law was extended in 2005 to include the crime of FGM beyond just those who undertake the cutting, to those who facilitate it \u2014 including people who take women and girls abroad to be mutilated.\n\nMulticultural Britain Prepares for Summer Vacation by Warning Children About FGM, Forced Marriages Abroad https://t.co/KxZSmDJmgA \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 25, 2018\n\nBreitbart London reported in July that as many schools broke up for summer holidays that police forces were taking to Twitter to warn against holidays that are not \u201cwhat it seems\u201d, and patrolled airports to talk to members of the public to \u201craise awareness\u201d about FGM.\n\nThis year was unique, however, in the UK and U.S. as police and border officers coordinated in joint operations at New York City\u2019s JFK Airport and airports across Britain in September, targeting families on return flights from countries where the abuse is prevalent and looking for warning signs \u2014 including girls having trouble walking or standing.\n\nOperation Limelight USA (based on Britain\u2019s Operation Limelight) launched their own programme in June to aid children at risk of FGM at Newark Airport, following on from a pilot programme initiated at JFK International Airport in 2017.\n\n5) Can the USA learn from France?\n\nWhile the lessons of Europe point to struggles with cultural influencers, Politically Correct police, and toothless legal systems, there exists one \u2018success story\u2019: France.\n\nFrance introduced an anti-FGM law in 1983 with the threat of 10 years in prison, or up to 20 years for cutting a girl under the age of 15, and with parents considered accomplices to the crime.\n\nHundreds of parents and \u201ccutters\u201d have been jailed.\n\n\u201cAt first the African communities didn\u2019t want parents prosecuted, but it\u2019s against the law and the law is the same for all,\u201d French lawyer Linda Weil-Curiel told The Guardian in 2014. \u201cWe explain to doctors the importance of examining all children.

He argued with four members of the team in one area of the consulate for about seven minutes. At one point Khashoggi is heard saying, \u201cRelease my arm! What do you think you are doing?\u201d\n\nKhashoggi was then taken to the administrative section of the consulate, where a different four-minute audio clip was allegedly recorded. This recording reportedly features several more Saudis, including Consul General Mohammed al-Otaibi and Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a close aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who reports claim led the team from Saudi Arabia. Both al-Otaibi and Mutreb appear on the list of 17 individuals sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for involvement in the Khashoggi killing.\n\nCetin\u2019s sources stated that one of the voices captured on the second recording \u201chas yet to be identified.\u201d\n\nMutreb reportedly can be heard in this segment of the recording shouting at Khashoggi, \u201cTraitor! You will be brought to account!\u201d Turkish security sources claim Mutreb\u2019s voice can be heard in 19 telephone calls made from the consulate on the day of Khashoggi\u2019s visit, beginning with a call made to the crown prince\u2019s media adviser Saud al-Qahtani about 13 minutes after Khashoggi\u2019s arrival.\n\nQahtani\u2019s name also appears on the U.S. sanctions list, and he was fired from his job last month after Saudi investigators identified him as a subject of their inquiry. Common theories of the killing portray Qahtani as an operative of the monarchy sent to persuade Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia and \u201crepatriate\u201d him involuntarily if persuasion failed.\n\nAnother voice in the second recording reportedly remarks, \u201cIt is spooky to wear the clothes of a man whom we killed 20 minutes ago.\u201d Cetin\u2019s sources said this was the voice of Saudi engineer Mustafa al-Madaini, allegedly brought to Istanbul because he vaguely resembled Khashoggi and was photographed and videotaped walking around Istanbul in Khashoggi\u2019s clothes after the killing, presumably in an effort to conceal Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nCetin said the recording includes Madaini receiving detailed instructions for getting noticed and caught on camera as he wandered around Istanbul. It also captured Madaini complaining that Khashoggi\u2019s shoes were too small for his feet and requesting permission to wear his own sneakers instead.\n\nThe officials who described the audio to Cetin implied it was made with eavesdropping devices planted in some parts of the Saudi consulate, while other areas were not covered. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar insisted on Monday that Turkish intelligence has \u201cno surveillance within the consulate\u201d but refused to specify the source of the recordings.\n\nCetin\u2019s sources claimed to have recorded the sounds of Khashoggi suffering physical abuse but not his actual murder, ostensibly carried out in an area of the consulate not covered by recording devices. Those rooms, located on the upper floor of the building, were allegedly sanitized and repainted by the Saudi team after the killing.\n\nThe Haberturk article concludes with speculation by Cetin\u2019s sources that the \u201clocal collaborator\u201d who helped the Saudis dispose of Khashoggi\u2019s remains was a Turkish security officer, plus contradictory speculation that the Saudis want to trick Turkish officials into believing the collaborator holds such a post, because they wish to \u201cdisorient\u201d the Turkish government.\n\nDefense Minister Akar stated on Monday that his government has no current plans to make the Khashoggi recordings public but held out the possibility of releasing them in the future."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "AWR Hawkins", "title": "Police Praise Homeowner for Shooting Home Invasion Suspect, Saving Family", "description": "Police in Warren, Ohio, praised a homeowner who shot a home invasion suspect in order to defend his family early Tuesday morning.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/21/police-praise-homeowner-shooting-home-invasion-suspect-saving-family/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/concealed-carry-We-the-People-tatoo-AP-640x480.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T22:30:02Z", "content": "WKBN reports that Ken and Heather York were asleep when their dog began to growl and they heard the sound of glass breaking.

That claim is not only false, but by denying the fact of Antifa violence, Cuomo is offering defense and cover to left-wing intimidation tactics.\n\nIn just the last month, Fox News host Tucker Carlson\u2019s home was surrounded by Antifa who intimidated and terrorized his wife who was home alone. Don\u2019t worry, CNN was too busy worrying about whether or not Tucker\u2019s door was cracked.\n\nIn September, Ted Cruz and his wife were hounded out of a restaurant by Antifa protesters who explicitly stated that their goal was to make him feel \u201cunsafe.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, CNN also defended that.\n\nAnd in August, under the guise of \u201cfighting hate,\u201d Antifa randomly attacked journalists, police officers, and bystanders. Antifa also participated in a chant explicitly calling for the destruction of America.\n\nThese examples are just small potatoes compared to the violent harassment that conservatives and Trump supporters around America have experienced over the past three years. Breitbart News\u2019 John Nolte has chronicled 639 incidents of violence and harassment targeting Trump supporters.\n\nSo what is Chris Cuomo even talking about? Just because he isn\u2019t being targeted by Antifa, it\u2019s not a problem?\n\nIf Cuomo is actually so worried about attacks against the media, it seems like he might want to pay more attention to Antifa, given the numerous examples of Antifa attacking journalists.\n\nBut then again, that would go against CNN\u2019s, and Chris Cuomo\u2019s past of defending Antifa."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "John Hayward", "title": "Hayward: Give Thanks for What Remains of Free Speech", "description": "Free speech is increasingly imperiled as nations around the world turn to authoritarianism, which comes packaged as everything from iron-fisted dictatorial rule to coercive \u201cprogressivism.\u201d One thing every brand of authoritarianism has in common is speech cod\u2026", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/11/22/hayward-give-thanks-for-what-remains-of-free-speech/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/08/NoHate-BerkeleyFreeSpeechRally-August-2017-AP.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T22:15:47Z", "content": "One thing every brand of authoritarianism has in common is speech codes.

Dissenting ideas dilute authority, so they must be suppressed. We should be thankful for the free speech that remains, and rise from our Thanksgiving tables prepared to fight for it.\n\nOur political speech is soggy with endless calls to \u201cfight\u201d for various \u201crights,\u201d few of which bear any resemblance to what America\u2019s founders considered to be inalienable rights. One important clue to their thinking is that rights were seen as something an unjust government could take away from citizens by force, not something benevolent governments present to citizens as a gift.\n\nFreedom of speech was codified as the first of those rights because preserving the others is impossible without the ability to speak up and organize. We might reflect on the importance of religious freedom as the very first component of the First Amendment because inalienable rights are impossible to understand without acknowledging a power higher than the state from which those rights descend. Once the concept of rights is understood, safeguarding the ability to discuss them and organize peacefully to protect them is vital.\n\nAuthoritarianism reverses this model of free speech. Speech becomes a dangerous resource to be rationed out carefully by the state. Dissent becomes a menace to authority. It does not matter if the authoritarian rulers see themselves as god-kings, brutal dictators, social justice warriors, or benevolent caretakers of a childlike populace. The principle remains the same: the horizons of acceptable speech must contract because authority must not be questioned and dogma must not be challenged. \u201cConsensus\u201d and \u201cunity\u201d become the highest civic virtues.\n\nAuthoritarian China ranks near the bottom of free speech studies: 176th out of 178 nations on the World Press Freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders, two of the bottom 20 entries on the Freedom House Freedom in the World Index (Tibet is listed separately, and its lack of freedom is due to Chinese oppression), 130th out of 159 nations in the Cato Institute\u2019s Human Freedom Index. But the Chinese government does not represent itself as a jackbooted personality-cult dictatorship like North Korea. The Chinese claim their gigantic censorship apparatus is vitally necessary to maintain public unity for the greater good of the people. Beijing derides complaints about its censorship policies as a hypocritical foreign plot to undermine national harmony and subvert the Communist government.\n\nChina\u2019s language is being adopted around the world with disturbing speed, in part because the Chinese use \u201csharp power\u201d or economic leverage to force foreign companies to obey their speech codes. In 2018, China forced airlines to change their websites, Western companies to fire their employees, and giant clothing retailers to apologize because they sold T-shirts that contradicted China\u2019s territorial claims. China\u2019s grip on Hollywood also grew inexorably tighter.\n\nMost disturbingly, the Western titans of the Internet have grown more agreeable to China\u2019s demands for censorship and more hospitable to Chinese thought. This is not just about helping the tyrants of Beijing keep their own people in the dark. It is about Western companies internalizing China\u2019s constricted view of free expression and agreeing with it. They think censorship can be sanctified by using it for noble ends such as fighting racism and homophobia, rather than keeping a pack of Politburo dinosaurs in power. Big Tech is making the terrible mistake Galadriel avoided in The Lord of the Rings by refusing to don Sauron\u2019s ring. They think malevolent power can be purified by using it for benevolent ends.\n\nIn the United States, Chinese-style speech controls are slipping in from academia, where \u201cdeplatforming\u201d speakers and legitimizing the Heckler\u2019s Veto have long been popular. The Heckler\u2019s Veto is simply the brute-force application of speech codes as a means of maintaining peace and unity: threaten to disrupt the peace until the authorities decide protecting \u201ccontroversial\u201d speakers is too difficult and follow the easier path of canceling their appearances. It is not very difficult for a ruthless, determined, and noisy minority to convince authorities ranging from university administrations to city governments that silence is the affordable alternative to loud and potentially violent protests.\n\nThe frontiers of free speech have moved online, where disruptive protests are even easier to organize. Retweeting and clicking \u201clike\u201d are much easier than showing up for street theater. Organized online networks bloated with fake accounts and bots provide an easy way for relatively small groups of people to appear as huge and menacing movements. Social media campaigns have proven very effective at drafting nervous corporations into political crusades and bullying them into disciplining or firing employees for politically incorrect speech.\n\nOne of the disturbing trends in 2018 was the privatization of censorship, as a small group of huge tech companies began working together to silence objectionable individuals. They have interpreted term-of-service violations with such ludicrous degrees of political bias that they can censor conservatives for merely repeating what left-wingers are free to say. Concerted corporate efforts to deny them web space or shut down their income streams can threaten entire platforms. The left now blithely assumes big tech companies will take action to shut down conservative speech and assumes social media systems are broken when politically incorrect thoughts are trending.\n\nMany on the right have difficulty mounting a passionate defense against these techniques because they cleave to the principle that free-market companies should be allowed to set whatever terms of service they see fit, or refuse to do business with whoever they please \u2013 principles that do not hinder censorious left-wingers for a microsecond when they target corporations with pressure campaigns. The prospect of federal regulatory remedies for speech-controlling corporate cabals strikes free marketeers as a cure that might be worse than the disease.\n\nAnother aspect of corporate speech control is the fetishization of guild media privileges as the essence of free speech. Press freedom is a subset of free expression, not the other way around. Press freedom tends to be easier to quantify with think-tank studies and, naturally, media people are eager to denounce offenses against their own speech rights, but a society in which only credentialed members of the press enjoy untrammeled free speech is not a free society.\n\nIt is a grave mistake to conflate freedom of speech with freedom of the press. They are both important, but they are not the same thing. Large media organizations have proven themselves quite comfortable with suppressing speech they dislike. Those who worry about the undue political influence of giant corporations should resist making an exception for giant media corporations. They profit from free expression, and like any other resource, speech grows more valuable as it becomes more scarce.\n\nNo discussion of the precarious state of free speech is complete without mentioning Islam and its strict speech codes, which are beginning to find purchase in Western societies. Europe saw the imposition of its first sharia speech law in October with the European Court of Human Rights prosecution of an Austrian woman for blasphemy against Mohammed.\n\nThese codes are theoretically justified as bans against insulting the sensibilities of any religion, which would be bad enough from a free-speech standpoint but, in practice, only one religion is likely to enjoy vigorous protection. Islam is serious about its blasphemy codes and ready to use everything from lawsuits and grievance politics to the Heckler\u2019s Veto to enforce them.\n\nIn a decaying free speech environment where using \u201chim\u201d and \u201cher\u201d to refer to biological males and females is suddenly controversial, the censorship demands of an activist Muslim minority will count for more than the relaxed attitudes of moderates who merely frown at blasphemy.\n\nEnergy is the key factor now that free speech is highly negotiable, a social commodity rather than an inalienable right. The speech police are more energized and better organized than stalwart defenders of free speech. The list of dangerous ideas grows dangerously long. Instead of fighting for free expression, people want to get in the game with their own list of banned words, blacklisted speakers, and boycotted companies. Holding the other side to the \u201cnew rules\u201d of political correctness seems like a more effective strategy than celebrating the principle of free speech while our adversaries roll over us with bulldozers.\n\nBe thankful for free speech, because you will probably have less of it next year."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Joshua Caplan", "title": "L.A.

Our justification for the column is simple and twofold: What first ladies wear has always been of interest to the public; plus, fashion is a means of communication, especially for a first lady like Trump who says so little. Conservative website Breitbart also has a column devoted to Trump\u2019s fashion, with one key difference from our own coverage: the injection of opinion. It is often as simple as hyperbolic adjectives used to describe a particular garment or a look, but it ultimately serves a larger, subliminal narrative: Despite her silence and inaction in her role, Trump\u2019s unwavering ability to look stylish is somehow enough. Breitbart\u2019s column \u2014 which never deviates from flagrant affection but sometimes amps up to profound wonderment \u2014 is written by reporter John Binder, whose expertise, according to his Twitter profile, is \u201cimmigration and fashion.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the fashionistas have recognized Breitbart\u2019s in-house arbiter of style. Last year, the New York Times featured Binder\u2019s work in a profile for the front page of its Style section.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find Mr. Binder in the front row of the season\u2019s hottest shows, gushing over the sometimes kinky collections of star brands including Alexander Wang or Marc Jacobs,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Ruth La Ferla wrote. \u201cNor is he likely to get much love from the left-leaning fashion establishment.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t live this grand fabulous lifestyle,\u2019 said Mr. Binder, who was reared in Slidell, La., near New Orleans, the youngest of eight siblings in a family of moderate means,\u201d La Ferla continued. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t come from a place of growing up in a grand apartment in the West Village, from a place of having the same opinion as everyone else.'\u201d\n\nWhen La Ferla asked Binder how his Breitbart fashion coverage fits with his more extensive reporting on immigration, he explained that he approaches both issues as a populist who respects the tastes and interests of everyday Americans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the very few news outlets that cover immigration from the point of view of the American worker,\u201d he noted.\n\nAs for Breitbart\u2019s fashion coverage, Binder said, \u201cWe\u2019re reporting with the gaze of ordinary people who want to look at photos of beautiful women in beautiful clothes.\u201d\n\nThough he admires powerful women, Binder told La Ferla that he does not consider himself a feminist because the movement \u201chas denigrated women, reducing those who feel that their chief purpose is to raise children to feeling that they are not on a par with these yuppies on the Upper East Side.\u201d\n\nYou can read more of Binder\u2019s Fashion Notes coverage here."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "The Committee for Responsible Foreign Policy (Sponsored)", "title": "American Conservative Conference Calls for Restraint in U.S. Foreign Policy, End to Unauthorized Wars", "description": "Lawmakers and foreign policy experts gathered in Washington, DC on Thursday for a day-long conference to discuss the need for a more restrained American foreign policy.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/21/american-conservative-conference-restraint-foreign-policy/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-21-at-4.45.53-PM-e1542836955625.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:56:10Z", "content": "The following post is sponsored by The Committee for Responsible Foreign Policy (CRFP).

Rand Paul (R-KY) as the keynote speaker, and panels discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and East Asia, defense spending, and military readiness. It was hosted by The American Conservative magazine.\n\nWatch Rand Paul\u2019s Keynote Address:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that there is a majority of American people who believe as I do and as many of you do that we\u2019ve been at war too long, and in too many places. I think there is a possibility for changing things, and I will continue to agitate for that,\u201d Paul said during his remarks.\n\nThe American Conservative Editor Jim Antle began the conference by noting that two consecutive presidents \u2014 Trump and former President Barack Obama \u2014 had questioned U.S. foreign policy post-9/11. Yet, he said, the same wars are still ongoing. He called for Congress to regain and reassert their constitutional powers over matters of war and peace. \u201cWill they rein in the executive branch in this area as the constitution requires it?\u201d he asked.\n\nReps. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Ken Buck (R-CO), who spoke on a bipartisan panel, called for more members of Congress to take back control over declaring war, particularly in Yemen. The U.S. has since 2015 supported a Saudi-led coalition fighting against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nWatch Congressman Khanna and Buck:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our founders would have imagined the extent we have abdicated our influence on foreign policy,\u201d Khanna said.\n\nHe slammed administrations going back to former President George W. Bush, calling foreign interventions \u201cone blunder after another.\u201d He said when presidents have campaigned on a message of peace, Americans \u201cseem to like the message. \u2026 But presidents don\u2019t make the changes they promise when they campaign.\u201d\n\nBuck said his fellow Republicans failed to take tough votes on authorizing wars, out of concern of keeping their majority. \u201cI have more faith that the Democrats will raise this issue in the Congress and force this debate,\u201d he said. Khanna said Democrats have also been unwilling to raise the issue out of concern over looking weak on foreign policy.\n\nBuck called on the American people to force Congress to make tough decisions, saying, \u201cI have no faith that Congress will move in a direction that puts members at risk until the Americans forces us to.\u201d\n\nDefense experts, who also served in the military, discussed how much foreign policy has been militarized today, and how that has affected troops.\n\nGil Barndollar, director of Middle East Studies at the Center for the National Interest and a Marine veteran, criticized putting young U.S. troops in foreign countries expecting them to engage in nation building.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re out there in the front lines, they are not trained, selected or prepared to be ambassadors of America,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ask them to be ambassadors, one, that\u2019s not going to happen. If you try to make it work, you\u2019re going to compromise the lethality of the force.\u201d\n\nWatch the panel Veterans and the Forever War: Recent Vets on Military Reform and U.S. Foreign Policy:\n\nDan Grazier, the Jack Shanahan military fellow at the Project for Oversight of Government and a Marine veteran, argued that the U.S. military is being used to fight wars that have no military solution. \u201cThere is no military solution for a political problem in Afghanistan. Definitely not one in Syria, Yemen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have absolutely proven that.\u201d\n\nJeff Groom, author of American Cobra Pilot: A Marine Remembers a Dog and Pony Show and a Marine veteran, discussed how continuous wars combined with the desire to maintain an oversized military has hurt the nation\u2019s ability to fight and deter adversaries.\n\nHe said flying military aircraft past their service life and outside of their intended purposes has contributed to aviation mishaps, and last year, more troops dying in aviation mishaps than war. He said the concept that the military had to be large enough to fight two wars simultaneously was to justify military largesse after the Cold War, and as a result, the U.S. has a hollow military where a fraction of its units are combat ready and a sizable portion of the budget is going to personnel costs.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have enough bread to feed all the mouths,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething has to give.\u201d\n\nFormer National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton, who is now a lecturer at Hillsdale College, said President Trump would rather be the president known for solving the North Korea problem rather than the \u201cguy who turned places into glass or parking lots.\u201d\n\nHe said other than the two strikes in Syria after the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons, Trump has gone against interventionist ideas. He said the establishment \u201creally, really wanted to get boots on the ground in the Syria civil war. He resisted all along.\u201d\n\nWatch the panel Trump Politics and Foreign Policy Realism: A Media View:\n\nHowever, Antle noted that Trump\u2019s anti-war instincts \u201chave not yet broken with the foreign policy status quo\u201d in Washington.\n\nExperts also slammed the U.S.\u2019s foreign policy in the Middle East. Joshua Landis, author of Syria Comment and director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said the U.S. is trying to make Syria under the Assad regime and Iran so poor that they collapse.\n\n\u201cBeggar your enemies to the point where they collapse\u201d is the abandonment of the \u201cmost American principles,\u201d Landis said, that ultimately people will buy into the values of the U.S. He said this policy would condemn the region to poverty, which would only increase terrorism over the long run. Furthermore, he said, squeezing Iran would lead to more dependence on Russia and China, and less dependence on Europe.\n\nWatch the panel Middle East (In)stability: Telling the Difference Between Friends and Enemies:\n\nAbbas Kadhim, non-resident senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Institute at John Hopkins University, said there is no Iraq policy. The Iraq policy is really the Iran policy, he said.\n\nPaul Pillar, a non-resident senior fellow at the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University and a contributing editor to The National Interest, called American foreign policy in the Middle East too black-and-white.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we have this uber Manichean approach\u2026all the good guys are on one side of the line, the bad guys are on the other side of the line,\u201d he said.\n\nOn East Asia, experts argued for a realistic, non-militaristic approach to North Korea.\n\nHarry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, argued that North Korea will never give up its nuclear weapons. \u201cIf you have a more realistic approach, there\u2019s a lot of things we can do.\u201d\n\nKazianis said one problem with foreign policy is that there is a bias towards action. \u201cAction is praised,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing something is praised \u2026 . Everything\u2019s about doing something, pushing back.\u201d\n\nHe said there needed to be a way to \u201coperationalize\u201d the idea of restraint. \u201cMake them as sexy as action, because action is what everyone respects.\u201d\n\nWatch the panel The Future of Asian Power Politics: Is Trump Gaining or Losing Ground for the U.S.?\n\nThe Committee for Responsible Foreign Policy is a 501(c)(4) organization with the mission of pursuing a more restrained foreign policy that adheres to the Constitution.

The Milton High School athletic department issued a tweet at 8:05 a.m. on Tuesday morning that the Thanksgiving game had been moved back to its original time of 10:00 a.m. at Braintree High School. Mayor Sullivan also issued a similar announcement. Sullivan also said warming tents will be set up on the sidelines, and 500 pairs of hand warmers will be available for spectators in the stands.\n\nThe outcry, however, did not convince most administrators at other schools to follow suit and put their games back on for \u201cTurkey Day.\u201d As of last count, more than thirty games had been moved from Thursday to next week.\n\nTemperatures in the greater Boston area are supposed to reach a high of 22 degrees on Thursday. However, as one of the Twitter users said, football players in Massachusetts are used accustomed to playing in conditions even worse than those projected for Thanksgiving Day.\n\nMeaning, there was a time when football players in Massachusetts would just fight through harsh, wintry conditions and play the game they loved. Sadly, it appears those days are coming to an end.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Victoria Friedman", "title": "Terror Probe Launched After Two Improvised Explosive Devices Found in London Flat", "description": "Detectives from the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terror Command have launched an investigation after finding two improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at an unoccupied flat in London.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/11/21/terror-probe-launched-two-ieds-found-london-flat/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/British-UK-London-Police-Getty-2.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:55:56Z", "content": "Officers were called to an address in Craven Park, Harlesden, north-west London, at 9:30 am Wednesday to reports of two suspicious devices found in an unoccupied flat which was in the process of being refurbished, according to a police statement.

The move comes in the wake of Pelosi\u2019s winning back Rep.

Brian Higgins, in a reversal, will back Nancy Pelosi for speaker,\u201d is the latest headline in the Buffalo News in Upstate New York in a piece that details hows the Democrat has now endorsed Pelosi after earlier this week being a signatory to a letter in which he and others had pledged to oppose her.\n\nThe Buffalo News\u2019s Jerry Zremski wrote:\n\nRep. Brian Higgins of Buffalo reversed course Wednesday and said he will support Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to be the speaker of the House, delivering a devastating blow to a weakening rebellion in the ranks that aims to oust her from the top job in the incoming House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cHiggins, in a telephone interview with The Buffalo News, said he decided to support Pelosi after she agreed to rank two of his top priorities among the new Democratic House\u2019s priorities,\u201d Zremski said, adding, \u201cHe said Pelosi agreed that Democrats will advance a major infrastructure bill early in the next Congress, and that Higgins will be able to take the lead as House Democrats also work to pass his proposal to allow people to buy in to Medicare at the age of 50.\u201d\n\nThe piece goes on to quote Higgins as saying he and Pelosi \u201chave an agreement in principle,\u201d that \u201cthose are going to be two priorities, and that [he] will be the lead person on the Medicare buy-in.\u201d\n\nThe piece quotes Pelosi herself as well as praising Higgins and pushing infrastructure and this Medicare deal.\n\n\u201cFor years, Congressman Higgins has been an extraordinary leader on the issue of achieving quality, affordable health care for all Americans,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cHis Medicare buy-in proposal is an central [sic] to this debate, as we work to build on the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe [are] looking forward to working together to lower the cost of health care for hard-working families and raise their paychecks by building infrastructure of America, which is also an important issue to Congressman Higgins,\u201d Pelosi added. \u201cI am honored by his support.\u201d\n\nThe fact that an infrastructure deal is now front and center has to be music to President Donald Trump\u2019s ears. The embattled GOP president, facing a slew of investigations when Democrats do officially take control of the House in January, has been wanting to do an infrastructure deal since the beginning of his presidency\u2013and Democrats\u2019 openness to doing so could lead to a true bipartisan deal, even with the vitriol fuming from widespread investigations. Trump, for his part, offered to help Pelosi get the speakership with GOP votes if she needed them to stop the rebels from tanking her chances at returning to the job after eight years of a GOP-run House.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the GOP-held Senate will handle infrastructure, but that is where this Higgins story gets even more interesting: apparently, not just Pelosi worked the Democrat congressman for his vote, but the Senate Democrat leader Schumer got in on the action as well.\n\nZremski reports:\n\nMeantime, Schumer called Higgins and agreed that those two bills will be among the Senate Democrats\u2019 priorities, too. Passing those measures will be much easier in the House than in the Senate, though, because Republicans will continue to control the Senate in the next Congress.\n\nHiggins also said that the lack of a clear challenger to Pelosi\u2013Fudge, who was a possibility, dropped out, dealing a deathly blow to the rebellion against her\u2013factored into his decision. More from Zremski:\n\nHiggins said one other factor influenced his decision. Two possible challengers \u2013 Rep. Karen Bass of California and Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio \u2013 both endorsed Pelosi in the past two weeks. \u201cThe bottom line is, we don\u2019t even have a semblance of a viable alternative at this point,\u201d Higgins said.\n\nHis move comes after an extensive lobbying campaign by Pelosi and allies to get him on board, as Zremski wrote:\n\nHiggins said he changed his mind, though, after conversations with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York. Higgins said he also spoke with Rep. Richard E. Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat who will chair the House Ways and Means Committee, where Higgins serves as vice ranking member. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to her three or four times over the last several days,\u201d Higgins said of Pelosi. He said they discussed Pelosi\u2019s lack of attention to the major infrastructure bill and the Medicare bill that Higgins had been pushing. \u201cShe apologized about what happened last year and took responsibility for it,\u201d he said.\n\nPelosi is very close now, with both Fudge and Higgins flipping back in her favor, to locking down the votes necessary to get the job done and win the speakership."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Tony Lee", "title": "Rahm Emanuel Endorses Pelosi: \u2018Rookies Need Not Apply\u2019", "description": "Chicago Mayor and former President Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday endorsed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) bid to regain her Speakership.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/21/rahm-emanuel-endorses-pelosi-rookies-need-not-apply/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Rahm-Pelosi-Getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:41:25Z", "content": "Saying this is no time to have a rookie dealing with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and President Donald Trump, Emanuel praised Pelosi as someone who is as tough and cagey as McConnell is ruthless and Trump is unprincipled.

If you think you\u2019ve heard this before, you have: Genius insights of this sort have preceded nearly every major crime wave this country has experienced, from Philadelphia to California to a bloody period known as \u201cthe Warren Court.\u201d\n\nAs anyone with an amoeba\u2019s understanding of recent history knows, beginning in the early \u201960s, assorted heads-up-their-asses liberals jettisoned logic, common sense and a basic understanding of human nature by releasing criminals from the prisons where they belonged.\n\nInstead of punishing criminals, we would give them social services, education and job training \u2014 with the implied understanding that they wouldn\u2019t move next door to any of the reformers. The experts assured a disbelieving public that these policies would reduce crime.\n\nAs Thomas Sowell writes in The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy, the stage was set. Liberal criminologists\u2019 soft-on-crime policies were in place. We only needed empirical evidence.\n\n\u201cTHE RESULTS: Crime rates skyrocketed. Murder rates suddenly shot up until the murder rate in 1974 was more than twice as high as in 1961. Between 1960 and 1976, a citizen\u2019s chances of becoming a victim of a major violent crime tripled.\u201d\n\nPrior to this period, crime had been declining for three decades.\n\nThousands of Americans were murdered, raped, assaulted, disfigured and robbed as a direct result of the exact same policies that Jared and his assistant, Donald Trump, are trying to foist on the country right now.\n\nThen-Princeton professor John DiIulio Jr. looked at the consequences of a single order by a Carter-appointed judge, Norma Shapiro, that put a population cap on Philadelphia prisons in the 1990s. In an 18-month period between 1993 and 1994, 9,732 prisoners released as a result of Judge Shapiro\u2019s order were re-arrested for committing 79 murders, 90 rapes, 701 burglaries, 959 robberies, 1,113 assaults, 2,215 drug offenses and 2,748 thefts.\n\nIt took more than a decade of Reagan and Bush judges, Republican mayors and governors, and the endless complaints of ordinary people to produce the low crime rates we have today. Their formula was: Do the precise opposite of whatever the ACLU, the Brennan Center for Justice and The New York Times recommend.\n\nIn New York City alone, at least 10,000 people \u2014 mostly minorities \u2014 are not dead because Rudy Giuliani revived the idea of punishment for criminals, in lieu of understanding them.\n\nProgressive young hipsters living in Brooklyn today have no concept that their trendy neighborhoods would be uninhabitable war zones but for Mayor Giuliani. If you don\u2019t have order and safety in big cities, you can\u2019t have anything else.\n\nIn 1991 the U.S. murder rate was well over twice what it is today.\n\nNormal person: Thank God we started putting criminals in prison again!\n\nJared: LET\u2019S RELEASE THEM.\n\nA 2014 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that, within five years of release, 82 percent of property offenders, 77 percent of drug offenders, 74 percent of public order offenders and 71 percent of violent offenders were arrested for a new crime \u2014 after not getting caught committing God knows how many others.\n\nThis is not rocket science. Lock up criminals and they can\u2019t commit any more crimes. As a New York Times headline put it in 2004 with characteristic cluelessness: \u201cDespite Drop in Crime, an Increase in Inmates.\u201d\n\nBut there are no permanent victories with liberals. Brennan Center acolytes have been patiently waiting for everyone who knows anything to leave the building, so they could go back to springing criminals again.\n\nHillary\u2019s losing the election was a major setback. But then \u2014 in a stroke of luck! \u2014 criminologists discovered the president\u2019s ridiculously naive son-in-law! Joy reigned throughout the land!\n\nNot only does Jared have the advantage of knowing absolutely nothing about the history of the precise policies he\u2019s pushing, but he has a personal interest in lenient sentencing, inasmuch as his father is \u2014 as Obama calls criminals \u2014 \u201cjustice involved.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, Charles Kushner was thrown in federal prison for felony tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness tampering, to wit, hiring a prostitute to sleep with his brother-in-law.\n\nFor a wispy little fellow like Jared, of all the things life has given him to be embarrassed about, having to visit his father in prison has to rank pretty high. Surely we can come up with a better way for him to deal with the shame and humiliation of his father being a convicted felon than sentencing thousands of Americans to a new and dangerous crime wave.\n\nJared is the kind of moron who believes that the crime listed on a convict\u2019s baseball trading card is the worst crime he committed.\n\nThus, we\u2019re incessantly told that sentences will be cut only for \u201cnonviolent drug offenders.\u201d\n\nIf you are even passingly familiar with our justice system, you know that virtually everyone in prison is there as the result of a plea bargain \u2014 \u201c97 percent of federal cases and 94 percent of state cases,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nYou don\u2019t strike a deal with the prosecutor to plea to the worst crime you\u2019ve committed. You plea to the least serious offense.\n\nRape = indecent exposure\n\nArmed robbery = illegal gun possession\n\nFelony assault = disorderly conduct\n\nYou also plead guilty to the crime that can be proved unequivocally. Unlike witnesses, guns and drugs can\u2019t be intimidated out of testifying.\n\nSo what does Jared\u2019s bill do? It slashes the sentences for illegal possession of drugs and guns.\n\nTrump \u2018s attitude is, Yes, the sentencing reform bill is an idiotic idea that will do great harm to our country, but Jared\u2019s been down in the dumps, so it\u2019s the least I can do for the guy.\n\nAmericans will be murdered, raped and assaulted for the sole purpose of ensuring that Jared has something on his Wikipedia page other than: \u201cBFF of Saudi bone carver Mohammed bin Salman\u201d and \u201cGot into Harvard because his felon father gave the college millions of dollars.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "John Carney", "title": "Lighthizer Blasts China Trade Practices in Withering 50 Page Report", "description": "The latest report shows that China has continued its refusal to abandon unfair and irrational trade practices.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2018/11/21/lighthizer-blasts-china-trade-practices-in-withering-50-page-report/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/03/wi/afp/22/vb8aas_us-trade-representative-robert-lighthizer-had-good-news-eu-telling-lawmakers-e1532629403223.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:15:38Z", "content": "The trade representatives office published a 50-page update on its March study that accused Beijing of using a variety of tactics to force U.S. companies to hand-over technology to Chinese rivals.

The Cuban slave doctors typically cannot see their family or ask them to visit while working abroad and must work alongside local doctors who are paid the reasonable doctor salary for the country in question.\n\nOne of the most lucrative slave doctor contracts Cuba signed in recent memory was with the socialist government of former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, establishing a program called \u201cMais M\u00e9dicos,\u201d or \u201cMore Doctors.\u201d Cuba withdrew from the program last week after President-elect Jair Bolsonaro demanded that Cuba pay its doctors a fair salary if they wish to continue operating in Brazil.\n\nIn response to Bolsonaro\u2019s demands, the Cuban government insisted in a response in state media that no doctor receive salaries because they are on a \u201cfellowship\u201d or \u201cscholarship\u201d (becarios) program and are aware that they are not working as professional doctors yet when they sign up. Diario de Cuba, citing recently published Brazilian diplomatic cables, notes that there is no evidence that the Cuban regime ever referred to the doctors as becarios while negotiating to establish the Mais M\u00e9dicos program.\n\nThe cables in question date back to 2012 and document negotiations between Cuban and Brazilian government representatives on how to import as many doctors as possible without causing too much political backlash in Brazil. Cuban officials are quoted as repeatedly offering the Brazilians \u201ccompetitive pricing\u201d when compared to how much other countries like China and Venezuela were paying for the doctors.\n\nAt least one meeting between Cuban and Brazilian diplomats focused explicitly on \u201cthe price paid for each Cuban doctor\u201d and the question of whether the two countries should sign a commercial agreement or an intergovernmental agreement. The latter, like a treaty, would require the Brazilian Congress to approve the program. Lawmakers with constituencies made up in part of out-of-work medical professionals would likely vote against the plan, the two nations decided, so they agreed to bring in the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) as a conduit for the agreement. Brazil would pay PAHO and PAHO would process the Cuban doctors, keeping Congress out of the loop.\n\nDiario de Cuba emphasizes that none of the documents show anyone describing Mais M\u00e9dicos as some sort of educational scholarship program, as the Cuban government claims it is today.\n\nThe left-leaning Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo confirmed in its own reporting on the diplomatic documents that both nations schemed to avoid constitutional requirements that the Brazilian Congress approve the deal. The newspaper also noted that the Cuban government preceded its offer of a medical program to Brazil with the creation of private corporations \u201cto export labor and medical supplies\u201d without identifying itself explicitly as the Cuban government, which would open it up to sanctions limitations.\n\nThe Folha report quotes a memo on one of the Mais M\u00e9dicos meetings reading, \u201cThe Brazilian side proposed US$ 4,000 (US$ 3,000 for the Cuban government and US$ 1,000 for the physician) \u2026 The Cuban side, however, said it was expecting US$ 8,000 per physician and counter-offered US$ 6,000 (US$ 5,000 and US$ 1,000 for the professional).\u201d There is no indication that the doctors in question were students or fellows in this report, either.\n\nThe status of the doctors is critical to the current disagreement between Bolsonaro, and anti-communist conservative, and the Cuban Castro regime. Critics of the communist dictatorship\u2019s medical program note that the doctors work essentially as slaves \u2013 a term the doctors themselves have used \u2013 and generate millions used to later torture and imprison pro-democracy dissidents on the island. According to the BBC, Cuba generated $11 million off of the doctor slave trade in 2017, nearly all of the $14 million it generated in exporting goods and services. The end of Mais M\u00e9dicos means a loss in profit of $332 million for Cuba.\n\nBolsonaro issued a demand last week that the Castro regime pay its doctors a fair salary if it is to continue operating in Brazil.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow Cuban slavery in Brazil or continue to enrich the Cuban dictatorship,\u201d Bolsonaro said. He additionally demanded that Cuba allow doctors\u2019 families to visit them in Brazil and that Brazil screen all doctors for quality control before they are allowed to practice in the country, a demand the regime referred to as insulting in its withdrawal announcement.\n\nFollowing Cuba\u2019s withdrawal announcement, Bolsonaro stated that, upon taking office, he would grant political asylum to all Cuban doctors who wished to remain in Brazil and sought to incorporate them in society. Over 100 Cuban doctors sued in Brazil last year for fair salaries and the right to see their spouses and children; in response, the government froze their licenses to practice.\n\nBolsonaro has also launched a program to replace the over 8,000 Cuban doctors expected to leave with native doctors and has publicly speculated on offering student loan forgiveness to attract more doctors to jobs in rural areas.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Robert Kraychik", "title": "Elizabeth Yore on FGM: \u2018Silence from Feminists Has Been Deafening on This Issue\u2019", "description": "Elizabeth Yore highlighted in an interview on Wednesday the silence of left-wing feminists on the issue of female genital mutilation.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/11/21/elizabeth-yore-on-fgm-silence-from-feminists-has-been-deafening-on-this-issue/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/03/FGM-tool.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:12:40Z", "content": "\u201cThe silence from feminists has been deafening on this issue,\u201d said Yore. \u201cWe need the support of feminists who believe in the rights of women to enjoy sexual pleasure.

According to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, a project by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the facility is the first development China has built in the area in months, though China has not shown any indication that it seeks to abandon its development in the region. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague found that China\u2019s constructions in the region, mostly on Vietnamese and Philippine territory, were illegal under United Nations (U.N.) law. China vowed to disregard the ruling.\n\nCSIS describes its finding as a \u201cmodest new structure\u201d that first appeared in satellite images in July \u2013 a building of some sort topped by a radome and \u201can array of solar panels covering more than 1300 square feet (124 meters). The superstructure hides any other facilities or equipment that the platform may contain.\u201d There is no evidence that the floating structure is powered by anything other than the solar panels, limiting its usefulness.\n\nThe study notes that it is possible the structure could help ships navigate the Paracels, operating as a lighthouse or some other sort of aid \u2013 though a lighthouse already exists nearby. \u201cThe more likely possibilities, given Bombay Reef\u2019s strategic location, are military in nature,\u201d it posits. \u201cThe reef is directly adjacent to the major shipping lanes that run between the Paracels and the Spratly Islands to the south, making it an attractive location for a sensor array to extend Chinese radar or signals intelligence collection over that important sea lane.\u201d\n\nWhat the structure indisputably does, the report argues, is give China more control over one of the few areas left between the Paracel and Spratly Islands where the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) cannot control or monitor essentially all maritime activity.\n\n\u201cWith China\u2019s rapid buildup of capabilities in the Paracels and Spratlys, the only probable gaps in its domain awareness over the South China Sea are in the northeast around Scarborough Shoal and, to a lesser extent, the waters between the Spratlys and Paracels,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cAny extension of those capabilities to the south and east from Bombay Reef would bring China closer to its goal of monitoring and projecting power across the entire waterway.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government has not formally responded to the report, which indicates that China has once again violated international law. Instead, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Wednesday, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of the specific situation you just mentioned.\u201d\n\nChina, nonetheless, has not ceased to promote an outsized role for itself in the South China Sea, where it claims sovereign territory belonging to Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In the case of Taiwan, as it refuses to acknowledge the country\u2019s sovereignty, the Chinese government claims that all Taiwanese territory is under Beijing\u2019s jurisdiction. The Communist Party regularly claims that no disputes exist in the region and that claims of colonization in the region are an American fabrication. In an article preceding his visit to the Philippines this week, Communist Party leader Xi Jinping claimed that all disputes in the region had led to \u201cthe rainbow after the rain,\u201d and no further disagreements existed in the South China Sea.\n\nChina\u2019s next diplomatic step in the region is to impose a \u201ccode of conduct,\u201d dictated by the desire of Xi\u2019s leadership, to override international law. The code will instruct ships on how to navigate the international waters of the South China Sea, allegedly to avoid conflict in disputed areas. Chinese officials stated at last week\u2019s Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) conference that they expect the code of conduct to be completed within three years.\n\nThe Trump administration has vocally opposed any code of conduct that allows the Chinese government to dictate who can navigate through the South China Sea. As it stands, the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that any waters more than 12 nautical miles from the sovereign land of any country are international, and all ships shall be granted free passage. In remarks at the ASEAN conference, National Security Adviser John Bolton announced the U.S. would oppose a code of conduct that allowed China to block ships in international waters as defined by the UNCLOS.\n\nChina claims that many international waters are actually sovereign Chinese territory because it constructed artificial islands where land did not exist before, which directly violates the text of the UNCLOS.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Edwin Mora", "title": "Report: Angola Shuts Down \u2018Illegal\u2019 9 Churches Citing \u2018Poor Conditions\u2019", "description": "Law enforcement in Christian-majority Angola shut down at least nine churches this week as part of \u201cOperation Rescue,\u201d citing poor conditions and lack of security for worshippers, the Agencia Angola Press (ANGOP) outlet reports.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/11/21/report-angola-shuts-down-illegal-9-churches-citing-poor-conditions/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/01/wi/afp/13/3140s1r-e1542827978988.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:20:46Z", "content": "Under rules implemented in 2015, churches must collect 100,000 notarized signatures with copies of identification cards from people across a third of Angolas 18 provinces to operate in the mostly Catholic country, the state-run Jornal de Angola revealed that \u2026 [+2288 chars]", "fulltext": "Law enforcement in Christian-majority Angola shut down at least nine churches this week as part of \u201cOperation Rescue,\u201d citing poor conditions and lack of security for worshippers, the Agencia Angola Press (ANGOP) outlet reports.\n\nUnder rules implemented in 2015, churches must collect 100,000 notarized signatures with copies of identification cards from people across a third of Angola\u2019s 18 provinces to operate in the mostly Catholic country, the state-run Jornal de Angola revealed that year.\n\nSome Christian leaders argue that the measures amount to religious persecution.\n\nLast month, the Guiame news outlet warned, \u201cThe Angolan government will close churches that are not legally recognized as of November, through the extinction of platforms that allow the operation of denominations that are not within the [2015] requirements.

A spokesman for Ivanka Trump\u2019s lawyer said that none of her emails contained classified information. If that\u2019s true, it\u2019s an important difference. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the email use, but a spokesman for Ivanka Trump\u2019s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, didn\u2019t dispute the report. \u201cWhile transitioning into government\u2026 Ms. Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,\u201d said the spokesman, Peter Mirijanian. Mirijanian stressed that no classified information was transmitted in the messages, that no emails were deleted and that the emails have since been \u201cretained\u201d in conformity with records laws. \u201cWhen concerns were raised in the press 14 months ago, Ms. Trump reviewed and verified her email use with White House Counsel and explained the issue to congressional leaders,\u201d he said. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump defended Ivanka, calling concerns of potential wrongdoing \u201cfake news,\u201d while drawing a distinction between his daughter\u2019s email use and Clinton\u2019s. \u201cThere was no deleting like Hillary Clinton did,\u201d the president told reporters before departing to Mar-a-lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida for Thanksgiving. \u201c[Ivanka] wasn\u2019t doing anything to hide her emails.\u201d \u201cThere was no servers in the basement, like Hillary Clinton had, you\u2019re talking about all fake news,\u201d he added.

The sources say that masked Saudi interrogators tortured the women during the initial stages of interrogation, but it was unclear whether they were seeking to force the women to sign confessions or merely to punish them for their peaceful advocacy. Following the interrogations, sources said, the women showed physical signs of torture, including difficulty walking, uncontrolled shaking of the hands, and red marks and scratches on their faces and necks. At least one of the women attempted to commit suicide multiple times, the sources said.\n\nThe Saudi government has held the activists in the Dhahban prison on the western Red Sea coast since May, following a crackdown on women\u2019s rights campaigners charged with trying to \u201cdestabilize\u201d the Kingdom and supposed links with \u201csuspicious\u201d entities working outside the country.\n\nThe women were principally campaigning for the establishment of equal women\u2019s rights in the face of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman\u2019s reforms to various aspects of Saudi\u2019s religious law, which include allowing women to drive cars.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Saudi government strongly denied all allegations of torture, claiming the activists were subject to the \u201cstandard judiciary process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s judiciary system does not condone, promote, or allow the use of torture. Anyone, whether male or female, being investigated is going through the standard judiciary process led by the public prosecution while being held for questioning, which does not in any way rely on torture either physical, sexual, or psychological,\u201d a Saudi official said.\n\nThe Islamic kingdom has come under growing international condemnation in recent weeks following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country\u2019s embassy in Istanbul last month. Principal suspects in the case include members of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s inner circle, although he has denied any connection to the killing.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump confirmed that the U.S. would not pursue the allegations against the country involving Khashoggi further for fear of jeopardizing business and security relationship, despite growing criticism of the country\u2019s appalling human rights record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple equation for me. I\u2019m about making America great again and I\u2019m about America first,\u201d Trump said in his statement. \u201cWe may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Tony Lee", "title": "Scarborough: \u2018Stalinist\u2019 Trump Cares More About Making Money After Leaving WH than Re-Election", "description": "MSNBC host Joe Scarborough ripped President Donald Trump on Wednesday and claimed Trump is more concerned about enriching himself after leaving the White House than winning re-election in 2020.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/21/scarborough-stalinist-trump-cares-more-about-making-money-after-leaving-wh-than-re-election/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/scarborough.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:24:52Z", "content": "Scarborough blasted Trump for siding with Saudi Arabia on Tuesday regarding Jamal Khashoggis murder and said, after the GOP\u2019s 2018 midterm losses, a rejected Donald Trump is more dangerous, radical, and unhinged than the Donald Trump we watched the first two \u2026 [+1971 chars]", "fulltext": "MSNBC host Joe Scarborough ripped President Donald Trump on Wednesday and claimed Trump is more concerned about enriching himself after leaving the White House than winning re-election in 2020.\n\nScarborough blasted Trump for siding with Saudi Arabia on Tuesday regarding Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder and said, after the GOP\u2019s 2018 midterm losses, \u201ca rejected Donald Trump is more dangerous, radical, and unhinged than the Donald Trump we watched the first two years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going from Nixonian to Stalinist,\u201d he continued, as RealClearPolitics noted.

As always, DHS encourages vigilance by the public to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement.

Homegrown terror suspects increasingly rely on technology, such as end-to-end encrypted social media applications, to avoid detection. Terrorist groups are urging recruits to adopt easy-to-use tools to target public places and events. Specific attack tactics have included the use of vehicle ramming, to include the use of rental vehicles, small arms, straight-edged blades or knives, homemade explosives, and poisons or toxins.\n\nIn the advisory, DHS warned that some terrorist groups are seeking to employ new technologies and tactics, such as drones and chemical agents. Moreover, the department acknowledged that although terrorists have not used a commercial airplane to attack the U.S. since 9/11, they \u201ccontinue to target commercial aviation and air cargo, including with concealed explosives.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), a component of DHS, Thanksgiving will mark the busiest-ever travel season at airports with an estimated 25 million passengers expected to go through security checkpoints.\n\n\u201cWe do expect a record-breaking Thanksgiving travel season,\u201d TSA Administrator David Pekoske told reporters on November 13.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d he added, referring to additional staff, canine officers, technology, and equipment that will assist officers in processing people through airports.\n\nConsistent with the warnings from DHS, the TSA administrator warned, \u201cThe threats to aviation security are persistent. They are no less than they were in the 2002-2003 time frame. Please don\u2019t assume that because you don\u2019t hear about aviation threats in the media all the time like you might have immediately following 9/11.

Ivanka did not set up a secret server in the bathroom of her private home. Hillary did. Ivanka did not lie about her emails. Hillary lied repeatedly. Ivanka did not use BleachBit. Hillary used BleachBit to ensure no one would ever read the 33,000 emails she deleted. Ivanka did not use a hammer to smash phones as a means to ensure no one saw her emails. Hillary used a hammer to destroy multiple mobile devices. Ivanka did not deliberately attempt to hide her emails from the public and government. Hillary set up a secret server in her bathroom, deleted 33,000 emails with BleachBit, and took a hammer to her phones. This is the first time Ivanka has worked in government \u2014 which lends credibility to the fact she did not know she was violating policy. Hillary installed a secret server after serving for two decades in government. Ivanka was not properly trained on the use of government and personal email.

Marco Rubio (R-FL) is reportedly spearheading the effort, writing a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking for his Department to look into the proposal. Other lawmakers supporting the move reportedly include Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO).\n\nRubio has become Congress\u2019s most prominent voice against the Maduro regime and the country\u2019s worsening humanitarian crisis. In September, Rubio claimed there was a \u201cvery strong argument\u201d for a military intervention in the country on the grounds of national security.\n\nUnder the current State Department definition, countries that qualify as state sponsors of terror must \u201crepeatedly [have] provided support for acts of international terrorism.\u201d Countries currently on the list include North Korea, Iran, Syria, and Sudan, all of whom face severe economic sanctions as a result. The Obama administration removed Cuba from the list in 2015 despite that country\u2019s ties to the FARC, whose leadership lived in Havana for years, and Hezbollah through agreements with Venezuela.\n\n\u201cTaken together, the four main categories of sanctions resulting from designation under these authorities include restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance; a ban on defense exports and sales; certain controls over exports of dual use items; and miscellaneous financial and other restrictions,\u201d the department\u2019s website explains.\n\nA State Department report published last year found that the Maduro regime continues to provide a \u201cpermissive environment\u201d for Islamic terrorist organizations including Hezbollah and the Islamic State. They wrote at the time:\n\nTerrorist groups based in the Middle East find some support in Latin America despite the geographic distance. The call to fight in Iraq or Syria drew limited numbers of recruits from Latin America and parts of the Caribbean, which offered areas of financial and ideological support for ISIS and other terrorist groups in the Middle East and South Asia. In addition, in 2016 Hizballah maintained some financial supporters, facilitators, and sympathizers in the region that it could tap for support in building and expanding its activities there.\n\nThe Trump administration has already imposed various sanctions on the regime that include a ban on Americans dealing in Venezuelan oil and personal sanctions on Maduro and members of his inner circle. Trump himself has also repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of a military intervention, although such a proposal has repeatedly been met with both internal and international resistance.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Pam Key", "title": "Abby Huntsman: Trump Has \u2018Failed Miserably\u2019 on Saudis, Nothing \u2018America First\u2019 About Throwing CIA Under the Bus", "description": "Wednesday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d co-host Abby Huntsman criticized President Donald Trump standing by Saudi Arabia despite allegations the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Philippine citizens greeted Xi with widespread protests calling for China to stop violating the Philippines\u2019 sovereignty and mockery online, where citizens took to posting photos of Winnie the Pooh to mock Xi\u2019s large belly. Posting images of Winnie the Pooh online is illegal in China.\n\nDuterte\u2019s administration questioned the timing of the publication of poll results, noting that they appeared to be released to sabotage talks with Xi,\n\nThe poll, conducted between September 15 to 23,\u201d found 84 percent of respondents saying that the Philippines should not \u201cleave China alone with its infrastructure and military presence in the claimed territories.\u201d Another 86 percent said it was \u201cright\u201d for Duterte to invest in strengthening national defense in response to Chinese threats, and 71 percent expressed a desire to see Duterte appeal to international legal organizations to expel China from the Philippine territory it has colonized. As the number who disapprove of the current Duterte strategy went up three points since the last poll, so too did the number hoping to see Duterte engage in a diplomatic solution to the situation go down by three points.\n\nThe poll found near unanimous agreement that expelling China from the Philippine South China Sea was \u201cimportant\u201d: 87 percent of respondents said the Philippines must \u201cregain control of the islands occupied by China in the West Philippine Sea.\u201d The term \u201cWest Philippine Sea\u201d is often used in the country to describe the part of the South China Sea that falls into the country\u2019s sovereign territory.\n\nThe number of Philippine respondents eager to see Duterte confront China in the latest poll is higher than both prior results in SWS surveys and in other polls. In July, the Stratbase ADR Institute found that 73 percent of Filipino wanted to see Duterte actively confront China in the South China Sea.\n\nDuterte made clear this week that any attempt to confront China was unlikely to occur. Xi published an editorial piece in various Philippine newspapers before landing in Manila announcing that the dispute between the two countries was over, and both sides could now enjoy \u201cthe rainbow after the rain.\u201d Duterte greeted Xi warmly and agreed to 29 deals on infrastructure, cultural exchanges, government aid, and other development. Among the most controversial agreements is a deal to allow China to drill for oil and gas in the Philippine South China Sea.\n\nDuterte has repeatedly refused to challenge China in the region because, he says, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) would \u201cmassacre\u201d the Philippine military, a remark that has insulted many in the country. Duterte has also joked that the Philippines could one day become a \u201cprovince\u201d of China.\n\nChina claims most of the South China Sea, including territory belonging to Brunei, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It has illegally constructed artificial islands on reefs in the Spratly Islands, jointly possessed by the Philippines and Vietnam, and armed them with advanced military equipment. China insists the development is civilian and legal, despite a 2016 international court ruling finding the activity violates the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\nOn Wednesday, a new study by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative of Washington\u2019s Centre for Strategic and International Studies revealed satellite images showing further illegal construction in the region. This development appears to be the construction of an artificial island on Bombay Reef in the Paracel Islands, legally Vietnamese territory.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo responded to the SWS poll this week by condemning the firm.\n\n\u201cWe consider the question skewed as it misleads the public to believe and suggests that the current government has not acted on China\u2019s activities on the disputed areas in the West Philippine Sea,\u201d Panelo reportedly said. \u201cThis is far from the truth. The Duterte administration has been consistent in its stance in protecting our territorial claims and maritime entitlements.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s renewed ties with our giant neighbor in the North provides us a welcome opportunity for the public to know and understand China better. It does not happen overnight but we are confident that a more favorable public appreciation of China would happen in the future,\u201d he concluded.\n\nDefense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana made similar remarks on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI doubt the results of the survey.

Acknowledging this truth does not in any way condone his death at the hands of Saudi agents.\n\nTur\u2019s point was that everyone who mentions Khashoggi\u2019s Brotherhood past, including President Trump, is attempting to justify his murder:\n\nWhat they try to do is say that Jamal Khashoggi was not a good guy. They casually drop in that he \u2013 the Saudi Arabians say he was part of the Muslim Brotherhood and that he was an enemy of the state. Those two things are not true, and it\u2019s interesting to put Saudi Arabian propaganda into a U.S. statement.\n\nThe relevant passage from President Trump\u2019s statement on Tuesday read as follows: \u201cRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u2018enemy of the state\u2019 and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2013 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime.\u201d\n\nRyan Saavedra of the Daily Wire posted the Tur clip and noted that even the liberal Brookings Institute acknowledges Khashoggi was indeed a member of the Muslim Brotherhood:\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Katy Tur lies about foreign national Jamal Khashoggi, falsely claims that he was not part of the \u201cMuslim Brotherhood\u201d The Brookings Institute: \"Khashoggi had many friends among the Muslim Brotherhood and\u2026had joined the movement himself as a young man\" pic.twitter.com/68hlqFKTzD \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) November 20, 2018\n\nThe October 19 Brookings Institute post to which Saavedra referred, written by Senior Fellow Tamara Cofman Wittes, was critical of \u201cpro-Saudi social media\u201d and \u201cright-wing commentators in the United States\u201d who implied Khashoggi \u201cwas an extremist and that those who condemn his apparent murder are serving an Iranian agenda to break up the U.S.-Saudi alliance.\u201d\n\nThe post is generally sympathetic to Katy Tur\u2019s point of view on the Khashoggi murder and yet the very first substantive point made by Wittes is that Khashoggi did join the Muslim Brotherhood and everyone familiar with his work knows it. Far from being a \u201clie,\u201d as Tur falsely stated, Khashoggi\u2019s Brotherhood membership was a fact so widely known that it scarcely deserved mentioning:\n\nYes, Jamal Khashoggi had many friends among the Muslim Brotherhood and, as his colleague David Ignatius reported days after his disappearance, had joined the movement himself as a young man before apparently shifting away from it later in his career. No one who knew Jamal at all is surprised by these facts, no matter with what lurid framing they are now \u201crevealed.\u201d Whatever sympathies and associations he may have had, they do not change the apparent fact that Jamal Khashoggi was kidnapped, murdered, and dismembered to silence his freedom of expression. Those on the right who have spent decades fighting for free speech on campus will leap to tell you, correctly, that freedom of speech demands respect regardless of the political valance of the views espoused\u2014and that protecting the expression of unpopular views that challenge current political correctness is the acid test for the security of this right overall. So even if you believe that Jamal Khashoggi was a full-bore Brotherhood member with an agenda of Islamization for the Arab world, you should still condem his apparent assassination for the crime of speaking his mind.\n\nThe David Ignatius column cited by Wittes was posted on October 12 at the Washington Post, which was understandably concerned by the ominous disappearance of its contributor. Like Wittes, Ignatius strove to paint Khashoggi as a changed man who had a fiery youth but mellowed with age and became a worldly journalist instead of an Islamist agitator, but he did not deny Khashoggi\u2019s past:\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s intellectual interests were shaped in his early 20s when he studied in the United States and was also a passionate member of the Muslim Brotherhood. The brotherhood was a secret underground fraternity that wanted to purge the Arab world of the corruption and autocratic rule it saw as a legacy of Western colonialism. Khashoggi was hardly alone in this belief. The flavor of that period in Khashoggi\u2019s life was captured by Lawrence Wright, a journalist for the New Yorker who met him in Saudi Arabia more than 15 years ago. In his book \u201cThe Looming Tower,\u201d Wright quotes Khashoggi about the brotherhood\u2019s appeal: \u201cWe were hoping to establish an Islamic state anywhere. We believed that the first one would lead to another, and that would have a domino effect which could reverse the history of mankind.\u201d Bin Laden joined the brotherhood at about the same time Khashoggi did, in the late 1970s, says Wright. The two men shared a passion for the mujahideen\u2019s war in Afghanistan, first against the Soviet Union and later for power in Kabul. Khashoggi was covering the war as a journalist, but he was clearly sympathetic to the cause.\n\nThis argument is really about whether Khashoggi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood or supporter of its ideals at the time of his death. There is no question he was a member in his youth and the association persisted for a very long time. Those who claim he was never a member and never espoused Islamist ideals are lying. Their goal is to question the motives of those who insist on the truth, but the real question is why they seem to feel condemning Khashoggi\u2019s murder while being honest about his ideology is impossible.\n\nAs to what Khashoggi believed at the time of his death, he left a copious body of work behind expressing his views. He defended the Muslim Brotherhood as a force for democratic reform in the Arab world and criticized U.S. policymakers for their irrational \u201caversion\u201d to the organization. The title of his August 28 post was \u201cThe U.S. Is Wrong About the Muslim Brotherhood \u2013 and the Arab World Is Suffering For It.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, as of three months ago, Khashoggi was still a true believer in the Brotherhood\u2019s philosophy of Islamism and firmly convinced most of the Arab world shared his beliefs:\n\nThere can be no political reform and democracy in any Arab country without accepting that political Islam is a part of it. A significant number of citizens in any given Arab country will give their vote to Islamic political parties if some form of democracy is allowed. It seems clear then that the only way to prevent political Islam from playing a role in Arab politics is to abolish democracy, which essentially deprives citizens of their basic right to choose their political representatives.\n\nClaiming that Khashoggi turned his back on the Muslim Brotherhood is absurd. The real argument here is about the nature of the Brotherhood itself. Most of the commentators lying about Khashoggi\u2019s association with the MB are simply taking cheap shots at President Trump or parroting former President Barack Obama\u2019s pro-Iran foreign policy agenda, but some of them are interested in whitewashing the Brotherhood and pushing Khashoggi\u2019s view of it as a benevolent organization. They claim Jamal Khashoggi outgrew the Brotherhood, but what they\u2019re really saying is that the Brotherhood grew and evolved along with him.\n\nIt is also transparently ridiculous to deny Khashoggi was a political activist with hostile intentions toward the current Saudi government. He spent the last year working on setting up an advocacy group called Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN) that wished to continue the \u201cArab Spring\u201d spirit of revolution across the Middle East. He was raising funds for DAWN at the time of his disappearance.\n\nAgain, Khashoggi\u2019s activism was no excuse for abducting or murdering him, but pretending he was a disinterested journalist without ideological ambitions or political connections is profoundly dishonest. It is not necessary to agree with his agenda to condemn his death. It is also unnecessary to pretend he didn\u2019t have one."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Charlie Nash", "title": "Report: Facebook Hires Top Antitrust Lawyer to \u2018Prepare for War\u2019 with Trump Administration", "description": "Facebook hired Department of Justice antitrust chief Kate Patchen, consider the top antitrust lawyer in Silicon Valley, in a move which Business Insider claims could be a sign Facebook is \"preparing for war with Donald Trump's administration.\"", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/11/21/report-facebook-hires-top-antitrust-lawyer-to-prepare-for-war-with-trump-administration/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/04/GettyImages-944724820.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:39:41Z", "content": "According to Business Insider, Patchen, who worked at the Department of Justice for fourteen years, \u201cjoined Facebook as director and associate general counsel of litigation,\u201d changing her LinkedIn to reflect the change this month.

Airbnb\u2019s decision followed intense lobbying efforts by the BDS movement.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, an organization massively financed by billionaire activist George Soros, is now urging vacation giant Booking.com to follow Airbnb and immediately cease listing Israeli homes in the West Bank.\n\nIn 2010, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations gave a matching $100 million grant to HRW. At the time it was the largest grant given by Soros\u2019s group to a nongovernmental organization. Soros\u2019s Open Society also funds scores of far-left groups that support the BDS campaign.\n\nAirbnb said the company \u201cconcluded that we should remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, Airbnb refers to the West Bank, areas where Jews have had a historic presence for thousands of years, as \u201coccupied territories,\u201d implying that Israel stole the land from the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael opposes the \u201coccupied\u201d label, and has referred to the land in international forums as \u201cdisputed.\u201d The framework for all previous peace proposals, each of which was rejected by the Palestinian Authority, did not call for an entire Israeli evacuation from the West Bank.\n\nPalestinians never had a state in the West Bank and they are not legally recognized as the undisputed authorities in those areas. Jordan illegally occupied and annexed the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem from 1948 until Israel captured the lands in a defensive war in 1967.\n\nThe 1967 Six Day War was launched after Arab countries used the territories to stage attacks against the Jewish state. In 1988, Jordan officially renounced its claims to the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and unilaterally recognized terrorist Yasser Arafat\u2019s Palestine Liberation Organization as \u201cthe sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\nAirbnb\u2019s statement goes beyond the \u201coccupied\u201d canard to suggest Jews displaced Palestinians to build settlements. \u201cUS law permits companies like Airbnb to engage in business in these territories,\u201d Airbnb explained. \u201cAt the same time, many in the global community have stated that companies should not do business here because they believe companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced.\u201d\n\nHere, Airbnb seems to channel the wildly exaggerated Palestinian \u201cNakba\u201d narrative, which falsely claims that hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were expelled from their homes when the Jewish state was founded.\n\nThe reality is quite different. After Israel was founded in 1948, a military coalition of Arab nations immediately formed to wage war on the new Jewish state. Some local Arabs, who did not yet go by the name of Palestinians, left the area in anticipation of the war, others directly responded to the dictates of Arab states to stay out of the way so that invading armies could conquer Israel, and still others fled once the war started so that they were not caught up in the fighting.\n\nArab states waged the war after refusing to accept UN Resolution 181, which called for the partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. The Jews immediately accepted the resolution, but the Arabs forthrightly rejected the plan, launching a war to destroy the Jewish state.\n\nIt should be noted that Israel\u2019s Declaration of Independence called on the local Arab population to remain in place:\n\nIn the midst of wanton aggression, we yet call upon the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve the ways of peace and play their part in the development of the State, on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its bodies and institutions.\n\nIt is true that some Jewish groups, including the Haganah, encouraged local Arabs to flee, however those few documented cases were the exception and not the rule.\n\nThe Economist, for example, reported that the Arab residents of Haifa left their homes in large part because of Arab army warnings:\n\nOf the 62,000 Arabs who formerly lived in Haifa not more than 5,000 or 6,000 remained. Various factors influenced their decision to seek safety in flight. There is but little doubt that the most potent of the factors were the announcements made over the air by the Higher Arab Executive, urging the Arabs to quit. \u2026 It was clearly intimated that those Arabs who remained in Haifa and accepted Jewish protection would be regarded as renegades.\n\n\u201cArab officers ordered the complete evacuation of specific villages in certain areas, lest their inhabitants \u2018treacherously\u2019 acquiesce in Israeli rule or hamper Arab military deployments,\u201d wrote historian Benny Morris.\n\nAirbnb, meanwhile, singles out Jews for living in the West Bank while seemingly ignoring that Israel offered much of the territory to the PA in numerous peace proposals. As this reporter noted yesterday, if the Palestinians wanted a state, they would not have to resort to peddling the BDS movement. Israel attempted to broker a Palestinian state in much of the West Bank with a shared capital in Jerusalem numerous times.\n\nThose offers were made at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007, and more offers were made in 2008 and reportedly in 2014. In each of these cases, the PA refused generous Israeli offers of statehood and bolted negotiations without counteroffers. Many times, the PA launched campaigns of terrorism following the Israeli offers. The PA has since refused to return to the bargaining table, and has already rejected the Trump administration\u2019s forthcoming Mideast peace plan before it is even made public.\n\nIsraeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin slammed Airbnb\u2019s move as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d as well as \u201cdisgraceful and miserable.\u201d Levin called on his office to \u201cformulate immediate measures to limit the company\u2019s activity throughout the country\u201d and develop a plan to further promote West Bank tourism.\n\nStrategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan said he will investigate whether the decision violates local U.S. laws against boycotting Israel. He also called on Airbnb to explain why it singled out the Jewish state: \u201cNational conflicts exist all over the world. The heads of Airbnb will have to explain why they chose to take a racist political stance against some of Israel\u2019s citizens.\u201d\n\nKnesset Member Michael Oren, a former Israeli Ambassador to Washington, stated, \u201cAirbnb blacklists Jewish apartments in Judea and Samaria \u2014 not Palestinian apartments, not apartments in Turkish occupied Cyprus, in Moroccan occupied Sahara, not in Tibet or the Crimea.\u201d\n\n\u201cAirbnb\u2019s policy is the very definition of anti-Semitism.

Reyes Enriquez and his men are largely to blame for the escalation of violence in recent years in central Tamaulipas.\n\nEnriquez was being held in a federal prison in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, where it was expected that a federal judge would grant his release in the near future. Tamaulipas authorities sought his transfer so they could prosecute him on state murder charges. Mere hours after his transfer, a group of inmates murdered him.\n\nReyes Enriquez served in the Mexican military from 1990 to 1998, attached to a special wing of Mexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office (PGR) in Tamaulipas. There, he joined the ranks of the Gulf Cartel as a founding member of a dirty police and military deserter group called Los Zetas. By 1999, Reyes had officially resigned from his post as a federal agent to become a full-time Zeta hitman. During that time, El Rex played an active role in conquering Nuevo Laredo from the local gangs called Los Tejas and Los Chachos, as well as fighting off the forces of the Sinaloa Cartel who tried to take the city under order of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman.\n\nReyes was initially arrested, along with 10 of his personal gunmen, in June 2007 on weapons charges.

He said pro-European politicians should use opportunities in parliament to have a say over Brexit. \u201cI think that MPs should vote according to their judgment of the national interest and the interest of their constituents,\u201d he wrote. The referendum was not an \u201cinstruction to any MP on how to vote\u201d on the practical consequences around the economy, trade, migration or other arrangements that could emerge in Brexit negotiations, he said.\n\nClarke is the very model of a \u201cgood\u201d European: contemptuous of democracy, certain that he knows better than the electorate he supposedly serves, determined to push his country forward to ever closer union with the EU superstate come what may.\n\nIf a Europhile ideologue like Clarke is prepared to vote for Theresa May\u2019s deal then you know without a shadow of a doubt that Theresa May\u2019s deal is an abject surrender to the EU.\n\nUp till now, those of us of an optimistic bent have been able to console ourselves that, well hell, at least whatever Remainer crap May cooks up with her Remainer civil servants will get voted down in parliament.\n\nBut even this is no longer a certainty.\n\nThe problem, as we\u2019ve seen with the failure of the European Research Group members like Jacob Rees-Mogg to muster the necessary number of signatures to get Theresa May defenestrated, is that May\u2019s opposition is confused, divided, weak.\n\nThere\u2019s another Brexiteer faction including the likes of Michael Gove and Priti Patel which has made up its tiny mind that the best way of getting Brexit to happen is to support May\u2019s grisly sell-out and applaud her at every turn. It\u2019s a horrible thought but instead of being treated by fate as they deserve \u2014 say, having a crown of molten gold poured onto their heads like Viserys Targaryen \u2014 it\u2019s possible it might actually reward them for their fence-sitting, invertebrate betrayal of the Brexit cause.\n\nObviously, I haven\u2019t spoken to Gove about this: too painful.\n\nBut if we can ever bring ourselves to talk about this, I\u2019d say that approaching the enemy with a white flag and the promise of unconditional surrender is not a very powerful starting point for a negotiation.\n\nThis, effectively, is what the Brexiteer surrender monkey team are presumably gambling on. Some tattered fig leaf of a compromise will be included if not to get the Democratic Unionist Party on board than at least to sway enough Brexiteer waverers or overthinkers to get May\u2019s shoddy sell-out voted through.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d all these loser-traitors will be able to boast, as they tramp off into exile once victory has been declared by the Maybot Terminator. \u201cWe struck an amazingly good compromise where in return for our property, land, weapons, armour, horses, and daughters the noble victors didn\u2019t strangle any of us in the city dungeons, promised only to rape a few of our womenfolk and kindly agreed not to pour salt over our farmland because, well actually, they might want to use it themselves.\u201d\n\nI do hope I\u2019m wrong. But I\u2019m inclined to agree with this terrifying analysis by my fellow hardcore Brexiteer Laura Perrins at Conservative Woman.\n\nWe may hate and loathe and despise Theresa May all we wish, but there\u2019s no denying that she has run rings round Brexiteers.\n\nIt may well be that we don\u2019t get the result we want. Far from it\u2026\n\nSo now everything will come down to the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 in Parliament expected next month. However with the DUP, Labour, the hard Brexiteers and some pro-European Conservatives united in opposition to the draft withdrawal agreement, it is hard to see how it will get through the Commons. Then we will leave on WTO terms, I hear you say. Not so fast. Many are saying that a no-deal Brexit would still have to be approved by Parliament. The government is required to table a motion setting out its plans in the event that it loses the meaningful vote and John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, has made clear to MPs that he would ensure they had the chance to express a view either as an amendment or through an opposition day or back-bench debate. As the days go past a second referendum looks more and more likely \u2013 perhaps one with two options: leaving on WTO rules or Remaining in the EU. The thing about ousting a Prime Minister or indeed making such a fundamental change to your governance such as leaving the European Union is that you have to want it. You have to really, really want it. Many Conservative MPs don\u2019t want it \u2013 we have known this for a while. Recent rumours are that Conservative constituency associations do not want it enough either and fear any leadership change. So they will settle for this awful deal instead.\n\nAnd when we get four or five years of Jeremy Corbyn as a result it will be the Conservative party which is to blame: the grassroots for showing insufficient backbone; the fairweather Brexiteers (Gove et al) for allowing themselves to be bought off too soon; the hardcore Brexiteers (Mogg et al) for failing to strike hard enough early enough; but above, all the Remainers, led by May, for so obstinately determining to keep Britain part of a corrupt, sclerotic, socialistic, anti-democratic, failing superstate in breach of just about every Conservative principle imaginable.\n\nAs Jacob Rees-Mogg said on my podcast the other day it will be the biggest rift in the Conservative Party since the Repeal of the Corn Laws.\n\nI hope Ken Clarke is happy with his final contribution of significance to the party he has been corpulently occupying these last few decades: rendering it unelectable for at least a generation."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Joshua Caplan", "title": "Ben Sasse Signals Support for Investigation Into Ivanka Trump\u2019s Personal Email Use", "description": "Ben Sasse signaled he would support an investigation of Ivanka Trump's personal email use during a interview with Colbert.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/11/21/sasse-signals-support-for-investigation-into-ivanka-trump-email-use/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/SasseColbert1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:46:51Z", "content": "The Washington Post reported Monday that Trump sent hundreds of emails from a personal email address that she shared with her husband and senior White House advisor Jared Kushner.

The convention was a tour de force of conservative and libertarian legal thought, including several prominent liberals to debate controversial issues during the convention\u2019s panel discussions.\n\nOne of the most energetic topics of conversation was who President Trump should pick as his next attorney general to lead the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nLed by Gene Meyer and Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society boasts among its more than 75,000 members multiple former U.S. attorneys general, deputy attorneys general, solicitors general, and other top DOJ officials from every administration from the Reagan years to the current Trump years, not to mention dozens of senators, congressmen, governors, state attorneys general, and scores of federal judges. Together they constitute the best possible sounding board the president could hope for.\n\nEveryone at the Federalist Society seemingly agreed that the president can take his time to get this right. Matthew Whitaker is by all accounts doing an excellent job as acting attorney general, receiving uniform praise from all those present at the convention. DOJ is currently in good and capable hands, providing the president with a stable situation in which to carefully vet, consult, and consider what sort of attorney general will best enact his agenda.\n\nMoreover, there is a significant benefit to waiting until sometime in January to announce his final pick. The Senate will become much more pro-Trump on January 3. Aside from picking up four Republican seats with Trump allies Rick Scott (FL), Mike Braun (IN), Kevin Cramer (ND), and Josh Hawley (MO), Republican Trump critics like Bob Corker and Jeff Flake will be gone, with Corker replaced by the conservative Marsha Blackburn. All in all, the Senate could be five votes friendlier to the president and his agenda, and no longer closely divided when it comes to confirmations.\n\nThere is no reason to leave any AG nominee hanging over the Christmas break, where Democrats can be expected to snipe at anyone President Trump might choose. Better to do it when the new Senate is in place, when the Senate Judiciary Committee can expeditiously vote on the nomination, and Sen. McConnell can swiftly hold a final confirmation vote.\n\nThe clear consensus is that the president needs an attorney general who is three things: conservative, brilliant, and strong.\n\nSome of the names in the news include people who are not conservative on various issues that are enormously important to the president\u2019s political base and his campaign promises. Others are smooth politicians, but who have never been regarded as keen legal intellects. Still others have not shown that they are decisive leaders with a spine of steel to withstand the withering attacks would come their way on a daily basis if they lead DOJ.\n\nFour names repeatedly leaped from people\u2019s lips at the Federalist Society convention and were chatted up enthusiastically.\n\nEdith Jones\n\nFirst is Judge Edith Jones of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, appointed in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan at age 36. One of the most revered federal judges in America, Jones is the former chief judge of the New Orleans-based appellate court and is regarded as shockingly brilliant and one of the Clarence Thomas-style philosophical anchors of the entire judiciary.\n\nAt age 42, Jones was one of the two finalists to replace Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. The first President Bush ultimately tapped Justice David Souter \u2014 who proved to be a solid liberal \u2014 for that seat in 1990. Had Bush appointed Jones, coupled with his 1991 appointment of the originalist Justice Thomas at a similarly young age of 43, Bush would have presided over the same sea change in constitutional law now being effectuated by President Trump.\n\nA longtime Texan, Jones is thought of as a Margaret Thatcher-style \u201cIron Lady,\u201d someone who is fearless on principle and utterly unflinching in the face of public criticism but who does it all with grace and elegance. \u201cI would love to see Spartacus Booker or Kamala Harris try to tangle with Jones in a Senate oversight committee!\u201d said a state deputy attorney general at the convention who asked to stay anonymous.\n\nHer only disadvantages are that she does not have extensive management experience and has not worked at DOJ previously, though a strong deputy attorney general and strong chief of staff could remedy those items.\n\nAll that said, some of the leading lights on the bench take their cue from Jones, essentially regarding her as the Supreme Court justice that all of them wished she had become in 1990. Jones would be the first woman appointed by a Republican president to serve as attorney general.\n\nRay Randolph\n\nSecond is Judge Raymond Randolph of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Randolph is a former law clerk to the famed Judge Henry Friendly, then served as assistant solicitor general under Robert Bork and later as a deputy solicitor general, before being appointed to the D.C. Circuit by Bush 41 in 1990. Experienced at navigating political waters, Randolph could handle a Democrat-controlled House as well as anyone and knows everyone who is anyone in the capital. He also knows DOJ.\n\nAlthough Randolph knows DOJ, his challenge is one that he shares with Jones: He has never run a large operation. Once again, a strong deputy and chief of staff could be the cure.\n\nRandolph\u2019s wife, Lee O\u2019Connor, is a former assistant attorney general and likewise a high-powered and politically savvy legal mind.\n\nSteven Bradbury\n\nThird is Steven Bradbury, currently general counsel at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), who formerly clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas and later served as assistant attorney general in charge of DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), the elite legal team that is essentially the general counsel\u2019s office for the entire U.S. government. Currently, he manages a team of around 600 lawyers at DOT.\n\nBradbury is a principled originalist, one who not only knows DOJ very well as a senior officer but has now also served for two years in the Trump administration and has his finger on the pulse on the politics and legal controversies of the moment as well as the various players on the political field.\n\nThe challenge for Bradbury would be that the other names under consideration carry more weight, not because of anything lacking in his resume but rather because of the enormous gravitas of the others. But having held two Senate-confirmed positions with great responsibility, no credible person has expressed doubt that Bradbury lacks what it takes to fill this critical cabinet role.\n\nCharles Cooper\n\nFourth is Charles Cooper, who started his career in 1978 as a law clerk to Justice William Rehnquist, and later served as an attorney in DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division under President Ronald Regan. He then was confirmed by the Senate as Reagan\u2019s pick to be assistant attorney general leading OLC during Reagan\u2019s second term, the same position formerly held by Rehnquist and by Justice Antonin Scalia, and subsequently held almost 20 years after Cooper\u2019s tenure by Bradbury. Since the Reagan years, Cooper has become one of the most distinguished constitutional attorneys and Supreme Court litigators in the nation, including being the frontrunner to be President Trump\u2019s solicitor general until Cooper took himself out of consideration.\n\nHe is a favorite of many in the conservative movement, frequently representing the National Rifle Association and other top conservative organizations in court, and a prominent leader in the Federalist Society. He mentored and launched the careers of countless household conservative names in the law, including Sen. Ted Cruz, Judge James Ho of the Fifth Circuit, former Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand, and current Solicitor General Noel Francisco (who would have been Cooper\u2019s top deputy if Cooper had taken the SG position). When he led OLC, Cooper selected as one of his deputies yet another promising young attorney, the eventual Justice Samuel Alito. He is seen as one of the most accomplished and capable political operators in Washington, a rare skill set to couple with his famed legal capabilities.\n\nCooper\u2019s challenge is that he is closely tied to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, with whom he has been friends since the Reagan administration. Cooper helped get Sessions confirmed as attorney general, and represented Sessions in his private, personal capacity during the controversies of the past two years.\n\nOther respected conservative names are also being floated by others, including three from Texas: Sen. Cruz, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Rep. John Ratcliffe.\n\nAlso as mentioned above, still other names are being pushed by various groups but are regarded as falling short on one of the three criteria that the nation\u2019s leading legal conservatives think the president needs for DOJ.\n\nWhitaker is doing such a fine job on each of those matters as acting attorney general that some leaders are increasingly saying that perhaps President Trump could just nominate him as the permanent holder of that office. If the president does so, then he would need to name a new acting AG, because the Vacancies Reform Act would not allow Whitaker to be both the nominee for attorney general and the acting attorney general at the same time. But if the president is sufficiently impressed with his current placeholder, he could go that route.\n\nNational leaders at the Federalist Society convention discussed each of these names, arguing in favor of one or another, during the entire event last week. The one thing people agreed on is that the president can take all the time he needs to get this one right because key parts of his agenda hang in the balance.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

He has tried to strike down laws protecting marriage as a dual-sex institution and also the University of Michigan\u2019s race-based student-selection process. In this FGM case, he argues that it is too small an industry to be recognized as an interstate practice that can be governed by the federal constitution. But, he added, FGM can be outlawed and punished in state law.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nCongress had no authority to pass this [anti-FGM] statute under either the Necessary and Proper Clause or the Commerce Clause. That clause permits Congress to regulate activity that is commercial or economic in nature and that substantially affects interstate commerce either directly or as part of an interstate market that has such an effect. The government has not shown that either prong is met. There is nothing commercial or economic about FGM. As despicable as this practice may be, it is essentially a criminal assault, just like the rape at issue in Morrison. Nor has the government shown that FGM itself has any effect on interstate commerce or that a market exists for FGM beyond the mothers of the nine victims alleged in the third superseding indictment. There is, in short, no rational basis to conclude that FGM has any effect, to say nothing of a substantial effect, on interstate commerce. \u2026.

But between the unavailability of chairman posts and a leadership pipeline clogged with 70-somethings \u2014 Pelosi; Hoyer, the minority whip; and James Clyburn, the assistant minority leader \u2014 younger House Democrats have been left to ponder other opportunities.\n\n\u201cYou have some of the institutional members say, \u2018Who are these upstarts?\u2019 \u201d Rep.

Seth Moulton (D-MA), had attacked Pelosi as an \u201celitist\u201d and \u201cvery wealthy person\u201d out of touch with ordinary Democrats in the wake of the midterm election where Democrats retook the majority in the House.\n\nShe had also signed a letter along with more than a dozen other Democrats pledging to vote against Pelosi on the floor of the House of Representatives in January.\n\nBut then, as Breitbart News reported earlier on Tuesday, a letter from 2015 surfaced where Fudge backed former Judge Lance Mason who was convicted of a 2014 assault on his wife. He was convicted of hitting his wife 20 times, and then smashing her head into the dashboard of their car while their children watched from the backseat. Fudge\u2019s letter backing his character, sent to the prosecutor in Cuyahoga County, said Mason\u2019s behavior toward his wife Aisha Fraser during that assault \u201cis out of character and totally contrary to everything I know about him.\u201d Fudge went on to write that Mason \u201caccepts full responsibility for his actions and has assured me that something like this will never happen again.\u201d\n\nThat statement was written a bit too soon, perhaps. After a nine-month stint in prison for his conviction on this, he got out and got a job working for the mayor\u2019s office in Cleveland. Then, this weekend, his wife Fraser was stabbed to death\u2013brutally murdered\u2013and while police have not yet charged him, they have taken Mason into custody in the murder of Fraser.\n\nIn the wake of this development\u2013and with Pelosi throwing her a plum subcommittee chairmanship next year\u2013Fudge has dropped all opposition to Pelosi and endorsed Pelosi\u2019s bid for the Speakership of the House, effectively ending the rebellion against her.\n\n\u201cLast week I announced that I was strongly considering a run for Speaker of the House,\u201d Fudge said in a statement released Tuesday evening. \u201cMy consideration was due in large part to the lack of sustained efforts that ensure diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of the House. Further, despite the great success we experienced on November 6, voter protection and voter integrity are still at risk. The erosion of voting rights and civil rights was on full display in Georgia, Florida, North Dakota, Ohio and Texas. Our party should reflect the diversity of our changing nation and guarantee all our citizens the unfettered right to vote and to have every vote count. Leader Pelosi has granted me the opportunity to create the record necessary to satisfy the 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder, so that the protections of the Voting Rights Act will be reinstated and improved. She has also assured me that the most loyal voting bloc in the Democratic party, Black women, will have a seat at the decision-making table. I am now confident that we will move forward together and that the 116th Congress will be a Congress of which we can all be proud. I now join my colleagues in support of the leadership team of Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn.\u201d\n\nRep.

Moulton, one of the other leaders of the rebellion, is hurting now too:\n\nRep. Seth Moulton was the very image of a Democratic rising star. But his willingness to buck Nancy Pelosi \u2013 one of the things that helped his star rise \u2013 is now leading to a fierce backlash. My report from last night in Amesbury:https://t.co/TbjwTjHHWt \u2014 Kevin Robillard (@Robillard) November 20, 2018\n\nWhile there are some similarities between the rebellion against former Speaker John Boehner from the Tea Party that led to his 2015 downfall and the current anti-Pelosi Democrat rebels, there are key differences too:\n\nOne important difference between the challenge to Pelosi and the challenge to Boehner: While tea party activist types were largely supportive of coups against Boehner, the most committed grassroots progressives are on Pelosi\u2019s side.https://t.co/TbjwTjZiO1 pic.twitter.com/gr2oPHX7cW \u2014 Kevin Robillard (@Robillard) November 20, 2018\n\nIt remains to be seen what happens next. But if you\u2019re going to take a shot at the king\u2013or in this case, the queen\u2013you best not miss. And these anti-Pelosi rebels seem to have missed, at least for now."}]
