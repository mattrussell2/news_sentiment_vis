The DOJ has yet to release full details on the exact type of charges being brought against Assange. WikiLeaks tweeted recently: \u201cSCOOP: US Department of Justice \u2018accidentally\u2019 reveals existence of sealed charges (or a draft for them) against WikiLeaks\u2019 publisher Julian Assange in apparent cut-and-paste error in an unrelated case also at the Eastern District of Virginia.\u201d\n\nSCOOP: US Department of Justice \"accidentally\" reveals existence of sealed charges (or a draft for them) against WikiLeaks' publisher Julian Assange in apparent cut-and-paste error in an unrelated case also at the Eastern District of Virginia. https://t.co/wrjlAbXk5Z pic.twitter.com/4UlB0c1SAX \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 16, 2018\n\nThese charges were disclosed by Assistant US Attorney Kellen Dwyer who insisted they remain sealed, writing to a judge: \u201cDue to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged.\u201d Dwyer later noted that the charges would \u201cneed to remain sealed until Assange is arrested.\u201d Although the full details of the charges have not been revealed, it is known that they pertain to WikiLeaks publishing of classified U.S. documents, which raises the question \u2014 if Assange is being charged for the leak of classified documents, why isn\u2019t Hillary Clinton?\n\nBreitbart News has previously explained the Hillary Clinton email scandal in an article outlining the main points of the Clinton email saga.\n\nThe main points include:\n\nThis explains the sequence of events leading up to the creation of the server and the following discovery by the general public \u2014 it can simply be summarized by stating that Clinton ran a private server with classified U.S. documents that was easily open to hacks by hostile actors.\n\nIn July of 2016, then-candidate Trump predicted that foreign powers had already gained access to Clinton\u2019s private emails. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d\n\nThis was confirmed by FBI agent Peter Strzok who claimed to be aware of a \u201cforeign entity\u201d which had intercepted over 30,000 emails sent to or received by the unauthorized email server. So what classified information was Clinton storing on this server? Here are a few examples:\n\nHillary Clinton had a lot of classified information on that server. Hillary\u2019s statement to the Benghazi Committee is one of multiple statements that could open Clinton up to charges of perjury or obstruction of justice. And it is one of many areas in which Breitbart News led the media in exposing a Clinton falsehood. But Hillary Clinton did not simply expose national secrets. She put people\u2019s lives in jeopardy. Hillary Clinton posted and shared the names of CIA-protected intelligence sources on her private email server, including a defense attache and other covert U.S. agents working on matters including Iran and the Taliban and Pakistan. Clinton\u2019s server contained at least five different emails revealing the exact location or travel plans of U.S. Libyan ambassador Chris Stevens, who was murdered in the 2012 Benghazi attack. Stevens\u2019 killers, of course, knew exactly where he was going to be when they got him. When all was said and done, Clinton deleted thousands of emails with a software program called \u201cBleachBit.\u201d Bill Clinton\u2019s former aide Justin Cooper came back into the picture to deal with at least two of Clinton\u2019s 13 mobile devices. Cooper smashed them with a hammer or broke them in half, according to the FBI. The server itself was shipped off to an obscure company in Denver called Platte River Networks.\n\nIn 2010, following the release of the Afghan War Diary leaks by WikiLeaks, the White House condemned the whistleblowing group stating that the leak \u201ccould put the lives of Americans and our partners at risk, and threaten our national security,\u201d and insisted that the \u201cirresponsible leaks\u201d would not \u201cimpact our ongoing commitment to deepen our partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan; to defeat our common enemies; and to support the aspirations of the Afghan and Pakistani people.\u201d\n\nYet Clinton\u2019s email server seemed to have the very same effect that the publication of the WikiLeaks documents did, American lives were potentially placed at risk as a result of the classified documents published by WikiLeaks and stored in an insecure manner by Clinton.\n\nIt should be kept in mind as legal proceedings are brought forward against Assange that although the WikiLeaks document dump may have been wrong, Assange was far from the only individual leaking classified U.S. documents \u2014 so was the 2016 Democratic candidate for President of the United States."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Edwin Mora", "title": "U.S. Envoy Warns: Iran May Create Islamic State-Like Terror Group", "description": "Iran may help give birth to a \u201cmaligned\u201d Shiite terrorist group that mirrors the Sunni Islamic State\u2019s (ISIS/ISIL) savagery, the U.S. State Department\u2019s special envoy to Syria cautioned on Thursday.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/11/16/u-s-envoy-warns-iran-may-create-islamic-state-like-terror-group/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/wi/afp/11/8c0369_iraqi-commandos-kurdish-counter-terrorism-forces-arrested-members-al-e1540854797236.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:51:28Z", "content": "While speaking at the Sixth Annual Defense One Summit, U.S. envoy James Jeffrey argued that, in Iraq and Syria, where U.S.-led coalition and Tehran-allied fighters have together taken on ISIS, \u201cIt requires stability ops to break Iran\u2019s meddling influence.\u201d Je\u2026 [+2708 chars]", "fulltext": "Iran may help give birth to a \u201cmaligned\u201d Shiite terrorist group that mirrors the Sunni Islamic State\u2019s (ISIS/ISIL) savagery, the U.S. State Department\u2019s special envoy to Syria cautioned on Thursday.\n\nWhile speaking at the Sixth Annual Defense One Summit, U.S. envoy James Jeffrey argued that, in Iraq and Syria, where U.S.-led coalition and Tehran-allied fighters have together taken on ISIS, \u201cIt requires stability ops to break Iran\u2019s meddling influence.\u201d\n\nJeffrey cautioned that Iran \u201cwill create a new Daesh if we don\u2019t get at the underlying problem,\u201d using an Arabic acronym for ISIS.

But mass deportation is unacceptable too \u2014 both morally and logistically. Unauthorized immigrants living the U.S. should be brought out of the shadows and offered a long and rigorous road toward citizenship that depends on maintaining clean criminal records, paying taxes, and meeting several other requirements.\n\nAside from ending deportations and providing amnesty to the entire illegal population, the Galston and Kristol agenda also includes allowing countries like India and China to monopolize the U.S. legal immigration system, a plan that would drive down white-collar U.S. wages and further displace Americans in professional jobs.\n\n\u201cPer-country immigration limits should be eliminated to allow for the admission of the best qualified applicants,\u201d the policy brief advocates.\n\nCenter for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Jessica Vaughan has noted that an end to the U.S. country-caps in the legal immigration system would allow India to control nearly all legal immigration to the country for the next decade. Vaughan has written:\n\nIf the per-country cap were to be lifted, then for the next 10 years, nearly all of the green cards in the ordinary professional worker category would go to citizens of India. That means any company wishing to sponsor a professional from any of the other 150-plus countries that currently receive employment green cards or immigrant visas would have to wait 10 years or take their chances by entering the annual lottery for a temporary H-1B visa for that individual.\n\nSuch a change in legal immigration would shift wage pressure away from U.S. blue-collar workers and onto American white-collar workers who would likely experience more displacement due to the vast number of Indian workers that would be imported to the country every year to take high-paying professional jobs.\n\nThe elimination of country-caps in the U.S. legal immigration system is part of Rep.

That\u2019s not going to happen; it\u2019s going to be very difficult to get the prince out of this. A regional war is going to break out if the two crown princes don\u2019t go! If the secret deals are disclosed, it will cause unrest on Arab streets,\u201d Karagul thundered.\n\nThat was not the first paragraph of his op-ed. That was the headline.\n\nKaragul was not thrilled by Thursday\u2019s release of the Saudi prosecutor\u2019s preliminary report on the Khashoggi murder, and he was not impressed by the death sentences sought against five suspects. On the contrary, he saw the capital charges as merely Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to cover Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s tracks by liquidating everyone who could connect him to the \u201cmurder network\u201d that killed Khashoggi.\n\nIn Karagul\u2019s opinion, Turkish investigators have pushed the Saudi monarchy into a tight spot:\n\nThe Riyadh administration that initially denied everything is now, bit by bit, confessing and owning up to the crime in every statement it makes. You will see, in their next statement, they are going to own up to a lot more. As the evidence is revealed, they are going to step back and have no other choice but to own up. Supposedly a fight broke out and that is why they killed him. Supposedly the head of the squad that went there made the decision to kill him and they could not convince him out of it. None of this makes sense. The men came from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul to kill, to dismember, to destroy the body \u2013 and they brought all the equipment necessary to do this along with them. The decision to murder him was made in Riyadh; the instruction to kill was received from the crown prince\u2019s office or from him, and the entire team is composed of the crown prince\u2019s close men, high-level executives. The Intelligence and security are under his control anyway. They would not dare go from Riyadh to Jeddah without the crown prince knowing.\n\nThe other crown prince condemned in Karagul\u2019s headline is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, long ago fingered by the Turkish columnist as the true evil mastermind of the Arab states. Karagul predicted all of Crown Prince Zayed\u2019s dirty laundry would come tumbling out during Turkey\u2019s relentless investigation of the Khashoggi murder, and there will be hell to pay on the Arab street:\n\nThis is more than a murder case. This matter concerns the future of this region. It is the matter of how the Arab street will react once it finds out the kind of axis established and the regional war preparations made through the two crown princes. It is related to the kind of unrest that will break out once these two people\u2019s secret agenda with U.S. and Israeli intelligence is revealed. Unless Crown Prince Mohammed steps down, unless Mohammed bin Zayed, who has been using Saudi Arabia\u2019s power, is isolated, the Arab world, the Arab region is not going to find the chance to escape the regional conflict planned to be started in a couple of years.\n\nThe editorial concluded with some confused messaging as Karagul warned his readers about the \u201cbig trap\u201d that could plunge the Gulf states into war and simultaneously praised the Turkish government for setting that trap.\n\nOf course, Karagul is not alone in believing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi\u2019s execution or suspecting scapegoats will be selected to protect him. Saudi prosecutors have taken pains to exonerate him, but the U.S. sanctions announced on Thursday reach deep into his inner circle, targeting several aides so close to MBS that the New York Times said the rest of the royal family has \u201ccome to fear\u201d them.\n\nMiddle East Eye, which is not much more fond of the Saudi monarchy than Ibrahim Karagul, predicted on Friday the Saudis will either run out of fall guys to protect MBS or sacrifice so many of them that morale collapses and loyal service to the kingdom is seen as suicidal. The New York Times editorial board was not far behind Karagul in proclaiming the Saudi government an irredeemable mess and slamming the Trump administration for largely accepting the sanitized account of Khashoggi\u2019s death offered by Saudi prosecutors.\n\nAFP quoted analysts with the same idea as Middle East Eye about Saudi government plunging into chaos if too many loyal officials are punished to protect MBS, especially if they are executed.\n\n\u201cIt is very risky for the prince to threaten capital punishment to those who appeared to be following orders. It can potentially create rogue elements within the intelligence service,\u201d Bessma Momani of Canada\u2019s University of Waterloo cautioned.\n\nThe overall prognosis from AFP\u2019s contributors was that Crown Prince bin Salman will remain in power but will be severely weakened in the aftermath of the Khashoggi crisis, with his father King Salman bin Abdulaziz taking a more active role and delegating more power to other members of the royal family. AFP also anticipated Turkey and the U.S. would gain more leverage over the Saudi government as the price for accepting some version of Riyadh\u2019s story about how Jamal Khashoggi died."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Ken Klukowski", "title": "Klukowski: DOJ Should Appeal Court\u2019s Reinstating CNN Acosta\u2019s Credentials", "description": "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration in Washington, DC, on Friday to restore the White House press credentials of CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta.

Kelly ruled that the White House\u2019s action lacked such procedural protections.\n\nThis federal trial court is under the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In 1977, the D.C. Circuit in Sherrill v. Knight ruled that the Secret Service violated the First Amendment when it denied a press pass to someone who posed no safety threat to the president, holding that security concerns are the only permissible grounds for denying such a pass.\n\nBreitbart News editorialized that this D.C. Circuit decision was incorrect in cases where the press credentials are being denied via a White House decision, and that in such instances the case must be dismissed under the political-question doctrine. The D.C. Circuit was a liberal court in 1977 and never even ruled on whether and why it had the authority to adjudicate the matter.\n\nI continue to stand by that assessment. As I explained regarding the Supreme Court\u2019s 1962 case Baker v. Carr, which set forth the factors of the political-question doctrine:\n\nOne Baker factor is that a federal court cannot decide the matter \u201cwithout expressing lack of respect due coordinate branches of government.\u201d The White House is the president\u2019s house. He lives there, and sleeps there. Yes, it has offices, but the White House is not a department; it is not an agency created by Congress and subject to standard congressional oversight. It is instead the residence of the independently elected head of state, and those who work there do so as part of his household staff. CNN and Acosta are asking a federal judge to order the president as to whom he must allow into his home. The executive branch is a separate, coequal branch from the judicial branch. It would be as much of an insult for a federal judge to tell the president that he must allow someone into his living room as it would be for the president to order the Supreme Court regarding whom the justices must allow into their courtroom.\n\nThe reality is that not every legal wrong can fixed by a court order. The political-question doctrine is based on that fact. Here, there is not even a legal wrong to remedy. President Trump should have won, and still could on appeal.\n\nIt is possible that Judge Kelly thought that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s 1977 decision blocked him from considering the political-question doctrine. If so, then it is possible that this case must go to the D.C. Circuit, and then \u2013 because the D.C. Circuit\u2019s current membership is unlikely to revisit its 1977 decision \u2013 to petition the Supreme Court.\n\nIt is hard to see how the president could lose this fight at the Supreme Court. It would astound the Founders who wrote the Constitution that a federal judge would ever order the president of the United States that the First Amendment and Fifth Amendment require him to allow an ill-mannered reporter into his house to antagonize him at a public event. In addition to saying that judges cannot order the president to allow people into his house, they would say that telling a single reporter that he had to do his reporting from outside the White House because of his grossly unbecoming antics does not violate free speech.\n\nA TRO cannot be appealed in the federal system, but within days it will be converted into a preliminary injunction with a full written opinion. That injunction can they be taken to a higher court.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s 1977 decision has no value as legal precedent at the Supreme Court. If the Justice Department is willing to appeal this case all the way up, then President Trump should win in the end, just as he did in Trump v. Hawaiion the travel ban.\n\nThe case is CNN v.

The U.S. Attorney said the case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Karine Moreno-Taxman.\n\nCourt records obtained by Breitbart News revealed that immigration officers removed Facio-Santos from the U.S. in March 2010 through the Hidalgo, Texas, port of entry.

It is often hard, if not impossible, to guarantee both.\u201d\n\n\u201cFocusing on equal treatment often produces disparate outcomes, and focusing on equal impact often requires disparate treatment. Either way a system could be accused of bias. This is not just a computational problem \u2014 it\u2019s also an issue of ethics,\u201d the Facebook CEO continued. \u201cOverall, this work is important and early, and we will update you as it progresses.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of Facebook\u2019s appeal system, Zuckerberg declared, \u201cAny system that operates at scale will make errors, so how we handle those errors is important. This matters both for ensuring we\u2019re not mistakenly stifling people\u2019s voices or failing to keep people safe, and also for building a sense of legitimacy in the way we handle enforcement and community governance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe began rolling out our content appeals process this year. We started by allowing you to appeal decisions that resulted in your content being taken down. Next we\u2019re working to expand this so you can appeal any decision on a report you filed as well,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cWe\u2019re also working to provide more transparency into how policies were either violated or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn practice, one issue we\u2019ve found is that content that was hard to judge correctly the first time is often also hard to judge correctly the second time as well,\u201d Zuckerberg concluded. \u201cStill, this appeals process has already helped us correct a significant number of errors and we will continue to improve its accuracy over time.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Charlie Nash", "title": "Jeff Bezos: \u2018Amazon Will Fail, Amazon Will Go Bankrupt\u2019", "description": "In a recorded company meeting, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos declared, \"One day Amazon will fail.

Henry Waxman in California.\n\nSeveral celebrities endorsed Williamson\u2019s 2014 run for Congress including actress Eva Longoria, Nicole Richie, Jane Lynch, Marcia Cross, and Alanis Morrissette. She also saw support from former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and former Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich. She lost in a landslide.\n\nWhile none of her past supporters have publicly admitted knowledge of her 2020 aspirations, some guessed that Williamson was working on the idea. The big clue was a job listing that appeared in Hollywood seeking a social media director for a presidential campaign that would be \u201cpart campaign, part startup, part spiritual movement,\u201d for a female candidate who is a \u201cnon-politician, high-profile writer and spiritual personality.\u201d\n\nWilliamson liberally mixed her chatter about spirituality in with her political commentary in 2014.\n\nFor instance, in one interview she criticized capitalism as forgetting that \u201cWhen you see your fiduciary responsibility, which is the corporate matrix here, as the idea that you\u2019re making more money is more important than the righteous balance of energy.\u201d\n\nShe also claimed to be \u201cleft-wing\u201d saying, \u201cWhen it comes to policy, I\u2019m definitely a left-wing Democrat. There\u2019s no doubt about it, on policy.\u201d\n\nStill, after she lost, Williamson said that she learned to listen to herself, not her advisers, in politics.\n\n\u201cI kept waiting for people to tell me what to do and [I] tried to hire people who would tell me what to do,\u201d Williamson told Oprah. \u201cIt taught me what I should have already known: to only listen to myself.\u201d\n\nWilliamson joins an avalanche of Democrats looking to a run for the White House including former Vice President Joe Biden, and Senators Kamala Harris, Cory \u201cSpartacus\u201d Booker, and Elizabeth Warren. Others include Maryland Congressman John Delaney, Billionaire and Second Amendment opponent Michael Bloomberg, porn star lawyer Michael Avenatti, small-time West Virginia politician Richard Ojeda, and global warming guru and billionaire Tom Steyer, among up to a dozen more.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Pam Key", "title": "George Conway: Trump Administration \u2018Like a Sh*t Show in a Dumpster Fire\u2019", "description": "[ADULT LANGUAGE WARNING] Friday on Yahoo News\u2019 podcast, \u201cSkullduggery,\u201d George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, said the Trump administration was a \u201cshit show in a dumpster fire.\u201d While discussing his decision to withdraw his nam\u2026", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/11/16/george-conway-trump-administration-like-a-sht-show-in-a-dumpster-fire/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/George-conway.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:50:37Z", "content": "[ADULT LANGUAGE WARNING] Friday on Yahoo News\u2019 podcast, \u201c Skullduggery,\u201d George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, said the Trump administration was a \u201cshit show in a dumpster fire.\u201d While discussing his decision to withdraw his na\u2026 [+1035 chars]", "fulltext": "[ADULT LANGUAGE WARNING]\n\nFriday on Yahoo News\u2019 podcast, \u201cSkullduggery,\u201d George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, said the Trump administration was a \u201cshit show in a dumpster fire.\u201d\n\nWhile discussing his decision to withdraw his name from consideration for a job in the Trump administration, Conway said, \u201cI\u2019m filling out the financial forms, and it\u2019s like\u2014I forget what time of year it was, it was like late April\u2014man, I\u2019m thinking, I\u2019m watching this thing and, it\u2019s like the administration is like a shit show in a dumpster fire.

The paper does not address the internment camps.\n\n\u201cThe government has worked to modernize ethnic cultures, to strengthen cultural exchanges with foreign countries, and to enhance each group\u2019s cultural confidence while engaging in exchanges with and mutual learning from others,\u201d the white paper declares.\n\nIt goes on to argue that \u201cChinese\u201d \u2013 referring to Mandarin, the most common language among the Han ethnic majority \u2013 has been present in Xinjiang since \u201cancient times\u201d and that \u201cethnic people are enthusiastic about learning and using standard Chinese to adapt to economic and social development and increased communication.\u201d\n\nThe paper never refers to the language as Mandarin but, rather, \u201cChinese\u201d or \u201cPutonghua,\u201d which roughly translates into \u201ccommon tongue.\u201d While Putonghua often encompasses Mandarin as well as other less common dialects, they are all mutually intelligible, rather than distinct languages like Cantonese or Uighur.

A day later, Reuters reported that a coalition of 15 ambassadors from Western nations issued a letter to Beijing demanding they be allowed to observe the camps, which China describes as \u201cvocational centers,\u201d and confirm that the government\u2019s claims that no human rights abuses occur there are accurate.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying responded to the letter with outrage, calling the envoys\u2019 behavior \u201cvery rude and unacceptable\u201d and saying to reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you chose to publish this kind of story[.] Do you think that it is meaningful for 15 ambassadors to write such a letter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see no reason why they are concerned about the situation in Xinjiang and why they try to pressure the Chinese side by raising these demands in a co-signed letter,\u201d Hua insisted.\n\nThursday\u2019s white paper is far from the only one on human rights the Chinese government has published, typically putting them out in response to global outcries against communist repression. In 2016, as reports began surfacing that Xinjiang officials had banned, among other things, the public observance of Ramadan and individuals wearing beards or Islamic garb from public transportation, China published a paper titled \u201cFreedom of Religious Belief in Xinjiang.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo citizen suffers discrimination or unfair treatment for believing in, or not believing in, any religion,\u201d the report concluded, adding that Uighurs\u2019 current state of religious freedom \u201ccannot be matched by that in any other historical period.\u201d\n\nIn April, the Chinese government once again published a white paper, this time titled \u201cChina\u2019s Policies and Practices on Protecting Freedom of Religious Belief.\u201d The paper found no flaws with the way the government handled the repression of public displays of faith and covered not just Uighur Muslims, but other persecuted minorities, such as Tibetan Buddhists and the diverse ethnic pool of Chinese Christians.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Joshua Caplan", "title": "Report: Lame-Duck GOP House Judiciary to Subpoena James Comey, Loretta Lynch", "description": "Goodlatte will subpoena Comey and Lynch to appear before lawmakers ahead of House Republicans ceding power to the Democrats next year.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/16/report-lame-duck-gop-house-judiciary-to-subpoena-james-comey-loretta-lynch/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/loretta-lynch-james-comey-getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:32:23Z", "content": "The committee seeks information about the two Obama-era officials\u2019 \u201cdecision-maker ahead of the 2016 presidential election,\u201d an unnamed House Democrat aide revealed to Reuters.

Unnamed sources told NBC that Turkish officials had begun suggesting they would ease their pressure on the Saudi government in return for G\u00fclen being returned to Turkish territory.\n\nKhashoggi, a Washington Post contributor and critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS), disappeared in October after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul seeking marriage documentation. The Saudi government initially claimed he had left the consulate before disappearing but has since relented and admitted that Saudi agents in the consulate killed him. Riyadh has exonerated MBS personally of having any ties to the killing and has not divulged a body.\n\nTurkish officials have insisted that MBS organized Khashoggi\u2019s killing and must face political consequences for acting against a journalist.

Turkish prosecutors have demanded over 3,600 life sentences for G\u00fclen alleging that he was the mastermind behind the 2016 failed coup. The U.S. government, under both President Barack Obama and Donald Trump, has asserted that the Erdogan government has not offered any evidence showing that G\u00fclen was tied to that coup attempt.\n\nAt the time, the leaders of the coup released a letter identifying themselves not as Islamic G\u00fclen followers, but secularists within the nation\u2019s military seeking to prevent Erdogan from undoing the legacy of Republic of Turkey founder Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, who insisted on eradicating Islam from the country\u2019s laws.\n\nNBC News accused the Trump administration of requesting law enforcement to research whether it was possible to extradite G\u00fclen, or at least remove him from U.S. soil, despite his status as a permanent legal resident.\n\nNotably, the National Security Council and the Turkish government both told NBC News in statements that they had no information regarding such conversations and were not discussing the G\u00fclen and Khashoggi cases simultaneously.

The social media companies are becoming more arrogant in their insistence on their power to kick off users\u2014as are other providers of basic online services like payment companies. Given the highly polarized climate we live in, it\u2019s only a matter of time until pressure is placed on hosting companies, registrars\u2014and even registers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe private ownership of the internet infrastructure will be placed under intense political pressure possibly destroying it as an open forum.

The share of private investment fell by 12 percent in the first half of 2018, even as a growing list of Belt and Road projects reached into 117 countries. Overall, the Chinese initiative now boasts $256 billion worth of construction but only $148 billion in investment.\n\nCompounding the instability of Belt and Road \u2013 also known as One Belt, One Road (OBOR) \u2013 financing is the stress placed on China\u2019s economy by its trade war with the United States. The conflict has gone more poorly for Beijing than anticipated, leaving it with less money to spend on Belt and Road at a crucial moment when developing countries are rethinking their commitment to the project and private investors are backing away.\n\nAnother interesting quirk AEI\u2019s research uncovered is that China\u2019s hybrid public-private mega-corporations are not quite the obedient instruments of aggressive central policy Beijing might have hoped for. Many Belt and Road projects are meant to expand China\u2019s political influence across the hemisphere, but they are not terribly profitable.\n\nThe prospect of making Third World countries dependent on Chinese engineers to maintain their expensive new trains and power stations is tremendously appealing to the Communist Party but not for the Chinese engineers actually charged with doing the work, or the companies that pay their salaries. Some of the countries where China is pushing huge Belt and Road projects with lousy profit margins offer few business opportunities that would entice CEOs to swallow their losses on infrastructure construction.\n\nAlso unappealing for Chinese executives is the prospect of getting charged with \u201ccorruption\u201d and \u201cdisappearing\u201d into the prison system when the Politburo is displeased with their decisions. The fate of one such executive demonstrated what AEI drily described as \u201ca risk-reward trade-off that most private firms would flee.\u201d\n\nThe AEI study quarrels with American diplomats who describe Belt and Road as a \u201cdebt trap for developing countries,\u201d arguing that while BRI seems to have worked out that way in a few high-profile instances, the Chinese government generally is not interested in tricking Third World countries into taking out loans they cannot afford and gobbling up their territory when they come up short on their loan payments.\n\n\u201cThe PRC gains influence in BRI countries by often being the only country willing to supply capital and basic construction services such as power plants and highways. Losing money adds little in terms of influence,\u201d AEI explained.\n\nVenezuela was offered as an example, noting that China aspired to become the deteriorating socialist tyranny\u2019s \u201cprincipal partner\u201d in a mutually profitable relationship as other countries turned away in disgust, but instead found itself pouring money into the bottomless pit of the Venezuelan national oil company. \u201cIf there\u2019s a debt trap, China is also caught in it,\u201d AEI noted.\n\nThe South China Morning Post on Thursday quoted analysts who said investors are growing cautious about Belt and Road, including a Chinese academic who anticipated a significant contraction in the sprawling initiative as Beijing tightens its belt:\n\nDouglas Zhihua Zeng, a senior economist with the World Bank, said Chinese companies looking for belt and road opportunities should assess the risks before they take the plunge. \u201cThe BRI is a proposal but it is the projects on the ground that are making profits, and companies should make adequate risk assessments before they take the next step,\u201d Zeng said. \u201cFor private companies, the top priority is to survive, so if the companies are under intense cash-flow pressure and are unable to get loans, they may cancel their overseas investment plans.\u201d Li Wei, a professor at prestigious Peking University, warned in an online article last month that Beijing, under trade pressure from the US, should be cautious about the risk of a \u201chard landing\u201d of any belt and road projects. \u201c[We need to ensure] the soft landing of the BRI projects, and make strategic choices if necessary, to focus on key areas, countries and projects \u2026 to move according to our capabilities and in a cautious way, to make fuller assessments of each kind of risk, to ensure that the BRI won\u2019t become a diplomatic and economic burden,\u201d Li wrote.\n\nOn the other hand, Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping was hard at work pushing Belt and Road to Pacific island nations at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference on Friday, with promises of more spending on projects desired by Pacific governments but unappealing to private contractors in the West and Japan. Chinese representatives at APEC were unconcerned about Australia\u2019s new $2 billion initiative to push back against China\u2019s growing influence.\n\nThe Financial Times on Thursday advised the United States and its allies to recognize that Belt and Road projects remain popular in developing nations, so it is better to provide appealing alternatives than issue dire warnings about Chinese debt traps and hope Beijing\u2019s clients have second thoughts.\n\nFT noted that while a few high-profile debacles have occurred under BRI, about 85 percent of the projects are proceeding reasonably well, a reassuring percentage for investment-hungry developing nations.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is scheduled to introduce concrete U.S. alternatives to BRI at the APEC summit in Papua New Guinea this weekend. U.S. officials said Pence will promote a \u201cprivate-sector driven model\u201d that will \u201cstand in sharp contrast to the dangerous debt diplomacy that China has been engaging in in the region.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Ben Kew", "title": "Bette Midler Faces Backlash for 'Body Shaming' Melania Trump", "description": "Actress and Broadway star Bette Midler was slammed by fans over her vulgar remarks about First Lady Melania Trump, just weeks after she described women as the \u201cmost disrespected creatures on earth.\u201d", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/11/16/bette-midler-faces-backlash-for-body-shaming-melania-trump/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Bettemidlerslam1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:56:22Z", "content": "Midler shared a photo Melania posing for a British GQ shoot back in the year 2000 in a skimpy futuristic dress on board her then-boyfriend Donald Trumps private jet. \u201cThe dry cleaning bill for the upholstery on Air Force One must be insane. #FLOTITS,\u201d Midler \u2026 [+1839 chars]", "fulltext": "Actress and Broadway star Bette Midler was slammed by fans over her vulgar remarks about First Lady Melania Trump, just weeks after she described women as the \u201cmost disrespected creatures on earth.\u201d\n\nMidler shared a photo Melania posing for a British GQ shoot back in the year 2000 in a skimpy futuristic dress on board her then-boyfriend Donald Trump\u2019s private jet.\n\n\u201cThe dry cleaning bill for the upholstery on Air Force One must be insane. #FLOTITS,\u201d Midler wrote.\n\nThe dry cleaning bill for the upholstery on Air Force One must be insane.#FLOTITS pic.twitter.com/oI4yHfeX2O \u2014 Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) November 14, 2018\n\nMany social media users immediately took exception to the comments, denouncing them as sexist and an example of \u201cbody shaming.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve moved on to body Shaming?

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) the next Senate Judiciary Committee chairman.\n\nGrassley will leave a significant legacy, as the committee managed to confirm both Judges Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, as well as a historic number of circuit judges, despite significant levels of resistance from Senate Democrats.\n\nGraham, next in line for the Judiciary chairmanship, led the charge in defense of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, during this fall\u2019s Supreme Court nomination process.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican cheered Grassley\u2019s leadership in a statement on Friday, saying:\n\nI very much appreciate Senator Grassley\u2019s leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He chaired the committee with a steady hand, sense of fundamental fairness, and resolve. His leadership serves as a model to us all. Senator Grassley has much to be proud of during his time as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. His work, along with his Democrat and Republican colleagues, accomplished so much for the American people.\n\nGraham will play a powerful part in the new congressional term; he will lead the committee to confirm new circuit judges as well as potential new Supreme Court nominees, needing only a majority in the Senate, compared to legislation that requires 60 votes in the Senate and a majority of votes in the House.\n\nSen. Graham charged in a tweet on Friday that if he becomes the Senate Judiciary chair, he will confirm \u201chighly qualified conservative judges\u201d and pursue \u201caggressive oversight of the Department of Justice and FBI\u201d:\n\nIf I am fortunate enough to be selected by my colleagues to serve as Chairman, I will push for the appointment and Senate confirmation of highly qualified conservative judges to the federal bench and aggressive oversight of the Department of Justice and FBI. https://t.co/aGu4bXX1Hq \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) November 16, 2018\n\n\u201cFinally, I will continue to seek common sense, bipartisan solutions to major issues facing our nation,\u201d Graham said in his statement.\n\nWhen Fox News host Sean Hannity asked him this week what his number one priority will be if he becomes chairman, Graham said, \u201cJudges, judges, and more judges.\u201d\n\nSen. Graham said Tuesday that if he becomes chairman, he will investigate how the FBI handled its probes into Russian interference in the 2016 elections as well as Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal.\n\nWhen asked if he would look into the FBI\u2019s handling of those investigations, Graham said, \u201cTotally. The oversight function will be very much front and center.\u201d\n\nGraham has long criticized the FBI\u2019s handling of both of those investigations and has called for a second special counsel to look into what happened in those controversies.\n\nSen. Graham also backed President Trump\u2019s appointment of Matt Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general (AG) after Jeff Sessions left the post following the 2018 midterm elections. Graham contended that Trump legally appointed Whitaker to serve as acting AG.\n\n\u201cI think he was appropriately appointed legally,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has to recuse himself. I am confident the Mueller investigation will be allowed to come to a good, solid conclusion, that there\u2019ll be no political influence put on [FBI special counsel Robert Mueller] by Mr. Whitaker to do anything other than Mr. Mueller\u2019s job.\u201d\n\nGraham continued, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t recuse somebody because they have opinions different than the people they\u2019re overseeing. \u2026 The bottom line here is that Mr. Mueller will be allowed to do his job without political interference by Mr. Whitaker.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Joshua Caplan", "title": "John Kerry: \u2018People are Going to Die\u2019 Because Trump Left Paris Climate Accord", "description": "John Kerry claims \"people are going to die\" due to Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the 2016 Paris climate agreement.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/16/john-kerry-people-are-going-to-die-because-trump-left-paris-climate-accord/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/GettyImages-1054935968.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:46:37Z", "content": "\u201cPeople are going to die because of the decision Donald Trump made,\u201d the top Obama-era official told The Guardian in an interview released Friday. \u201cMy kids and my grandkids are going to face a difficult world because of what Donald Trump has done.\u201d While Kerr\u2026 [+2207 chars]", "fulltext": "Former Secretary of State John Kerry claims \u201cpeople are going to die\u201d due to President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the 2016 Paris climate agreement.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to die because of the decision Donald Trump made,\u201d the top Obama-era official told The Guardian in an interview released Friday. \u201cMy kids and my grandkids are going to face a difficult world because of what Donald Trump has done.\u201d\n\nWhile Kerry has deep regrets over President Trump exiting the climate deal, he says he feels \u201cbetter than a lot of people think\u201d about the agreement.

Output fell 0.3 percent for the month and utilization fell four-tenths of a percentage point to 76.7, below the long-term average but slightly above the May level. While some of this may be due to tariffs, the decline in prices for a lot of electronic equipment is likely a bigger factor.\n\nThere appears to be something of a glut in consumer electronics. The cost of televisions fell again in October, dropping by a seasonally adjusted 1.3 percent. This is the third consecutive monthly decline for televisions. Compared with a year ago, television prices are off 17.8 percent. The price of personal computers fell 1.6 percent and is down 4 percent for the year. Phone prices are down 6.6 percent compared with a year ago.\n\nAlan Tonelson, who examined the Fed data in a post on Friday, points out that appliance sales may have been dragged down by the sluggishness of the housing sector:\n\nAccelerating deterioration clearly characterizes the major appliances sector, but do tariffs (which include not only the metals levies but separate tariffs on household laundry machines that result from a trade law case initiated during the Obama years) deserve most of the blame? Maybe not, considering that the domestic housing sector \u2013 a big generator of major appliance sales \u2013 is in the middle of a noteworthy slowdown.\n\nThe China tariffs, which began to be applied to a larger array of consumer goods in September, may have boosted production. Output in furniture manufacturing, which is a major category for Chinese imports and had fallen in August, was up 1.4 percent in September and 1.6 percent in October. Compared with a year ago, output is up 3.1 percent. Utilization rose a full percentage point to 76.9, topping its long-term average of 76.7.\n\nRising output and utilization indicate that U.S. businesses may have to invest more to expand capacity if growth is to continue. Likewise, tighter labor supplies combined with rising output points to a promising wage picture for manufacturing workers."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Pam Key, Pam Key", "title": "Whoopi Goldberg to Trump: \u2018You Can\u2019t Poop on the Constitution\u2019", "description": "Friday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d the panel discussed a federal judge\u2019s ruling in favor of CNN by ordering that reporter Jim Acosta\u2018s White House access be restored.

People cheer; some 25 were allowed Monday, around 60 yesterday, we hear.\n\nThe metering is vital because it can operate alongside other asylum reforms to reduce the number of migrants who are released into the U.S. economy before their claims for asylum are heard by U.S. judges.\n\nThe most important of those other reforms is President Donald Trump\u2019s November asylum reform which promises a limited form of asylum \u2014 \u201cwitholding of removal\u201d \u2014 and possible fast-track deportation for migrants who are caught sneaking across the border.\n\nBorder \u201cMetering allows them to regulate the [asylum-seeking] people so [border agencies] don\u2019t get overwhelmed,\u201d said Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge who now works with the Center for Immigration Studies. If the metering continues, and the agencies have enough asylum officers, detention beds and other resources, they may be able to reduce catch-and-release practices for migrants who ask for asylum at the ports of entry, he said.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cwe don\u2019t know if it will work.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve heard it anecdotally since border-wide metering began in May. It\u2019s less a San Ysidro thing and more the smaller POEs in RGV. To give some data, last month only 1,003 family units & UACs admitted in South Texas; avg. 32/day across all Laredo Sector POEs. So 2-4 families/day. \u2014 Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@ReichlinMelnick) November 1, 2018\n\nTrump\u2019s November 9 withholding of removal reform is intended to block and deport the other stream of asylum-seekers \u2014 those who cross the border illegally and then ask for asylum.\n\nIf the metering and withholding of removal policies are allowed to continue, they may work together to end the catch-and-release of migrants that allows the cartels\u2019 to run their profitable, migrant-smuggling, labor-trafficking business into the United States.\n\nThe cartels need catch-and-release to ensure that their muggled migrants can get U.S. jobs, pay their smuggling bills owed to the cartels, and then pay for additional smuggling of other family members.\n\nIf the new policies reduce the daily number of migrants who get to the border to legally ask for asylum, border agencies will be better able to end the catch-and-release practice which funds the cartels\u2019 business.\n\nOne problem for the DHS is the growing public opposition in Tijuana to the expanding backlog of migrants on the Mexican side of the border. The opposition may force Mexican officials to end their cooperation with the metering process.\n\nAlso, U.S. pro-migration progressive and business groups oppose the metering policy and are asking judges to quickly outlaw the policy.\n\nDavid Bier, an advocate at the business-funded, pro-migration Cato Institute, argues that the metering policy is illegal. \u201cCongress unequivocally wanted no limits on asylum, yet the government has created one anyway,\u201d he wrote on November 14, adding:\n\nInternal [agency] documents released as a result of a lawsuit show that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told ports of entry that \u201cif you determine that you can only process 50 aliens at a time, you will request that the [Mexican government] release only 50. If [Mexico] cannot or will not control the flaw, your staff is to provide the alien with a piece of paper identifying a date and time for an appointment and return [them] to Mexico.\u201d It is illegal to return someone who has a credible fear of persecution. DHS has stationed its agents at the exact U.S.-Mexico borderline in front of the port of entry, pushing anyone coming to request asylum legally back into Mexico. If immigrants make it onto U.S. soil, that\u2019s supposed to entitle them to a hearing. But even when they cross the official line, officers ignore their pleas and tell them to go away. Trying to walk past them is a criminal offense. In October 2018, the government admitted 4,177 asylum seekers in family units\u2014that is 135 people daily\u2014at ports. Across 48 U.S.-Mexico ports of entry, that amounts to 2.8 family units daily at each port. The most family units allowed at ports per day during the Trump administration has been 3.8. The unpublicized limit is then an average of between 2.8 and 3.8 per day.\n\nPro-migration groups are suing the federal government to block the metering policy which they dub \u201cthe turnback policy\u201d:\n\nThe plaintiffs in the [metering] case are Al Otro Lado, a non-profit legal services organization that serves indigent deportees, migrants and refugees in Los Angeles and Tijuana, along with six courageous asylum seekers who experienced CBP\u2019s unlawful conduct firsthand. Their experiences demonstrate that CBP uses a variety of tactics \u2013 including misrepresentation, threats and intimidation, verbal abuse and physical force, and coercion\u2013to deny bona fide asylum seekers the opportunity to pursue their claims.\n\nIn June, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen touted the metering policy, saying:\n\nWe have limited resources. We have multiple missions at [U.S. Customs and Border Protection]. And what we do is, based on the very high standards we have, if we do not have enough bed space, if we do not have enough medical personnel on staff, if we do have enough caretakers on staff, then we will tell people that come to the border they need to come back. We are not turning them away. We are saying: We want to take care of you in the right way; right now, we do not have the resources at this particular moment in time. Come back.\n\nPro-migration group are also suing DHS to block the withholding of removal asylum reform.\n\nAt El Chaparral port of entry in Tijuana, Mexican immigration officials say 90 people will be allowed to make asylum claims today.

That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nImmigration also pulls investment and wealth away from heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations living in the coastal states."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Tom Ciccotta", "title": "Harvard Asian Discrimination Trial Will Hear New Arguments in 2019", "description": "The Harvard Asian Discrimination trial, which concluded recently, will hear a new series of arguments in early 2019.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/11/16/harvard-asian-discrimination-trial-will-hear-new-arguments-in-2019/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/wi/ap/05/afbfc0_harvard-president-12597-lawrence-bacow-in-feb-11-2018-file-photo-lawrence-e1539881565163.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:07:19Z", "content": "The Harvard Asian Discrimination trial heard closing statements from both parties in early November.

The Pakistani Supreme Court ruled that Bibi, who spent nearly a decade on death row for allegedly blaspheming against Muhammad, was innocent and should be freed immediately. Bibi and her family are currently in hiding in an undisclosed location in the country in response to violent riots following the Supreme Court decision calling for her death.\n\nThe largest riots, which forced schools and businesses to close for days in early November, were organized by the much larger Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party. The government responded to the riots by reaching an agreement with the TLP to allow them to appeal Bibi\u2019s release, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s being the court of last resort, and applying to ban Bibi from leaving the country.\n\nSupporters say Bibi will almost certainly die at the hands of a Muslim mob if a Western country does not grant her and her family asylum. A variety of countries \u2013 including Canada, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and France \u2013 have reportedly expressed interest in granting her asylum. The United Kingdom, citing its own Islamist population, reportedly declined to help her.\n\nWhile the TLP has called its members to stop rioting, the MMA has not. Rehman told his own supporters this week that the Bibi case was not a \u201clegal issue,\u201d but a conspiracy to bring Pakistan into the orbit of advanced secular nations, an unacceptable move for his party.\n\n\u201cIf Aasia Bibi\u2019s release is only a legal decision, why is there [a] flood of personal praises directed at the CJP [Chief Justice of Pakistan] and Imran Khan?\u201d he asked, according to Dawn. \u201cIt only proves that the decision was taken under a deal, which is now being praised in the West. What kind of legal decision is this which is being celebrated by the West and has caused anxiety in the Ummah [Muslim population]?\u201d\n\nRehman went on to insist, without elaborating, that \u201cImran Khan is a Jew representative and has been anointed by the West to play its proxy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow he has been brought to power only to play games of his masters and hurt the Ummah. The government is guilty of conspiring to alter the blasphemy law, setting blasphemers free and playing to Western tunes.\u201d\n\nPakistan\u2019s penal code delineates specific punishments for those who \u201cblaspheme\u201d against Islam. Insults against the person of Muhammad carry a mandatory death penalty, while more generalized blasphemy against Islam can result in a variety of prison sentences and fines. Blasphemy against other religions is generally permitted. While Pakistan rarely prosecutes blasphemy cases to completion, Islamist mobs often kill the accused before they make it to trial.\n\nImran Khan became prime minister this year largely due to the support of Islamist groups, which he most recently appeased with the TLP deal to prevent Bibi from fleeing the country.

Kelly, a Trump appointee, made clear that the ruling was not based on whether the White House violated Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights.

Further, Burnham also pointed out that CNN has dozens of other staffers with White House credentials, so excluding Acosta would not harm the network\u2019s coverage.\n\nThe network\u2019s lawyer, Theodore Boutrous, contended that Acosta was being singled out for his White House coverage, not his alleged rudeness during a news conference.\n\n\u201cThe White House has made very clear that they don\u2019t like the content of the reporting by CNN and Jim Acosta,\u201d Boutrous said. \u201cRudeness really is a code word for \u2018I don\u2019t like you being an aggressive reporter.\u2019\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, in an interview published Wednesday, told The Daily Caller that \u201cguys like Acosta\u201d were \u201cbad for the country. \u2026 He\u2019s just an average guy who\u2019s a grandstander who\u2019s got the guts to stand up and shout.\u201d\n\nA number of news organizations, including Fox News, CBS News, and NBC, announced their intention to file amicus briefs with the court in support of CNN.

Some have reportedly carried out attacks on Chinese soil. However, human rights groups have accused Beijing of systemically oppressing its Muslim Uighur minority under the guise of fighting terrorism and separatism.\n\nReportedly, some Uighurs who have converted to Christianity have also been sent to the mind-transformation camps."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Simon Kent", "title": "Watch: Boycott Israel Leader Arrested After Drunken Airline Tirade: 'Give Me a F***ing Glass of Wine'", "description": "A British boycott Israel activist has been arrested after she launched an expletitive-laden attack against staff on an Air India flight.

This means that based on free market exchange rates, teachers now earn less than a $100 a month.

He was also known for his instrumental versions of \u201cMalaguena,\u201d on 12-string guitar, and \u201cGhost Riders in the Sky.\u201d\n\nHe was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2009, and emotionally told the crowd how moving it was \u201cjust to be associated yourself with the members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and imagine that your name will be said right along with all the list.\u201d\n\nClark won a Grammy Award for best country instrumental performance for the song \u201cAlabama Jubilee\u201d and earned seven Country Music Association awards including entertainer of the year and comedian of the year.\n\nIn his 1994 autobiography, \u201cMy Life in Spite of Myself,\u201d he said \u201cYesterday, When I Was Young\u201d had \u201copened a lot of people\u2019s eyes not only to what I could do but to the whole fertile and still largely untapped field of country music, from the Glen Campbells and the Kenny Rogerses, right on through to the Garth Brookses and Vince Gills.\u201d\n\nClark was guest host on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d several times in the 1960s and 1970s when it was rare for a country performer to land such a role. His fans included not just musicians, but baseball great Mickey Mantle. The Yankees outfielder was moved to tears by \u201cYesterday When I Was Young\u201d and for years made Clark promise to sing it at his memorial \u2014 a request granted after Mantle died in 1995.\n\nBeginning in 1983, Clark operated the Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre in Branson, Missouri, and was one of the first country entertainers to open a theater there. Dozens followed him.\n\nHe was a touring artist as late as the 2000s. Over the years, he played at venues around the world: Carnegie Hall in New York, the Sporting Club in Monte Carlo, the Grand Palace in Brussels and the Rossiya Theatre in Moscow.\n\nClark was born in Meherrin, Virginia, and received his first guitar on his 14th Christmas. He was playing in his father\u2019s square dance band at age 15.\n\nIn the 1950s, Clark played in bands in the Washington, D.C., area. In 1960, he got the chance to front the band of country singer Wanda Jackson. He also performed regularly in Las Vegas. He got his first recording contract, with Capitol Records, in 1962.\n\nHe appeared on Jimmy Dean\u2019s TV show \u201cTown and Country Time\u201d and took over the show when Dean left.\n\nClark and Owens worked together for years, but they had very different feelings about \u201cHee Haw.\u201d Owens, who left the show in 1986, later referred to it as a \u201ccartoon donkey,\u201d one he endured for \u201cthat big paycheck.\u201d Clark told The Associated Press in 2004 that \u201cHee Haw\u201d was like a family reunion.\n\n\u201cWe became a part of the family. The viewers were sort of part owners of the show. They identified with these clowns, and we had good music.\u201d\n\nClark said the hour-long program of country music and corny jokes capped off his career.\n\n\u201cThis was the icing on the cake.

Richard Shelby, the GOP chairman of the Senate\u2019s appropriations committee, said Nov. 15 after meeting Trump for a budget discussion. His committee has penciled in $1.6 billion for the wall in 2019, compared to the $5 billion in the draft House bill. Shelby added, according to the Washington Post:\n\nAnd whatever we can do in a reasonable fashion, to get it done \u2026 might personally like a bigger goal. But I use the word doable. You\u2019ve got to figure out what\u2019s doable.\n\nThe Hill reported:\n\n\u201cI said we shouldn\u2019t ever want to shut down the government,\u201d Shelby told reporters when asked about discussion about a possible shutdown. \u201cI think maybe he agreed, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s response.\n\nHouse and Senate GOP leaders show no willingness to lead a public fight for wall funding as the Central American caravan\u2019s economic migrants gather in Tijuana before crossing into California. But several Senate and House GOP leaders are pushing the president to sign a crime bill that will provide an early release to thousands of violent criminals and drug smugglers amid a national drug-disaster which has killed 100,000s of Americans.\n\nDemocrats have enough votes and discipline in the Senate to block any budget deal, but they may want to avoid a budget clash and government shutdown so that they may endorse another $1.6 billion budget in 2019. The allocation would push Trump\u2019s border-wall spending up to a total of $4.8 billion from 2017 to 2019.\n\nBut Democrats are opposing Trump\u2019s push for $5 billion in wall funding in 2019.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s \u2018Wall or nothing!\u2019 they\u2019re going to get nothing,\u201d the top Democrat on the Senate\u2019s appropriations bill, Sen. Patrick Leahy, said November 12.\n\nDemocratic lobbyists predict their party will gain in 2020 from a 2018 impasse. The Hill reported:\n\n\u201cOne, it will continue to help with suburban women. Number two, it will mobilize Latino voters,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. \u201cThe third thing [is], particularly if Democrats lean into it, immigration can be a huge liability [for Republicans].\u201d\n\nDemocratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer is signaling he will approve a status-quo wall-building budget of $1.6 billion for 2019.\n\nBut he is also hinting that he may demand a price, such as accelerated green cards for roughly 400,000 Indian and Chinese white-collar visa-workers plus their family members. The green card plan was put in the House\u2019s draft DHS budget for by Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder, who subsequently lost his reelection campaign.\n\nIf Schumer demands a price for the $1.6 billion, he will be pressuring Trump to trade a series of wage-cutting amnesty concessions in exchange for a wall that cannot stop catch-and-release for the migrants who simply ask for asylum.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s business-first leaders are offering minimal support to Trump\u2019s wall, just as they have avoided Trump\u2019s pro-American immigration agenda since November 2016. Since 2016, GOP leaders have tacitly conceded to Democratic demands on migration to help ease the passage of business priorities, such as the tax cut and the confirmation of conservative judges.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine, with all the things that we have to do here to wrap up this Congress, that we would revisit immigration, but who knows?\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said November 7.\n\nThird-ranking GOP leader Sen. John Thune managed to show even less enthusiasm for border wall funding, according to The Hill:\n\n\u201cIt would be nice if we get a budget deal that includes wall funding,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what the traffic will bear when we get into the discussion. We have to do a budget to wrap up the year and some other cats.\u201d\n\nThe caravan didn't arrive before the election\u2013but they arrived just in time for the border wall debate in the lame duck Congress.

Lindsey Graham is enthusiastically pushing for a business-backed, DACA-amnesty-for-small-wall deal during the December lame-duck session. According to the Washington Examiner:\n\n\u201cYou have two problems, you have a gap in funding between the House and Senate on the wall,\u201d Graham told the Washington Examiner. \u201cAnd you might as well go ahead and deal with [Dreamers] at the same time. You\u2019ve got to give something to get something. You\u2019ll get your wall money if you do something on DACA.\u201d\n\nA DACA amnesty would likely put three million younger illegal aliens in the voting booth by 2028 and invite a subsequent chain migration of several million additional migrants.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Graham organized and pushed the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty which intentionally tried to flood the labor market and so shift more of the nation\u2019s annual income from workers to investors. For example, his amnesty bill also allowed an unlimited number of foreign-born college-graduates to get green cards and allowed presidents and border officials to provide asylum to an unlimited number of migrants.\n\nIn the House, GOP leader Rep. Tom Cole is also pushing the investor-boosting DACA-for-wall deal \u2014 even though the DACA amnesty would add at least three million Latinos to the voting rolls during the next decade.\n\nSome House legislators are also backing a series of expanded visa worker programs that would cut wages for white-collar graduates, blue-collar laborers, and farm workers.\n\nWashington\u2019s economic policy of using migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nImmigration also pulls investment and wealth away from heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations living in the coastal states."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Breitbart News", "title": "WikiLeaks: Julian Assange Charged in U.S.", "description": "(AFP) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who was behind a massive dump of classified US documents in 2010, has been charged in the United States, WikiLeaks said Thursday.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/11/15/wikileaks-julian-assange-charged-in-u-s/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/05/wi/afp/03/3rsea7e-e1501528576675.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T05:43:19Z", "content": "Prosecutors revealed the existence of the sealed indictment inadvertently in a court filing in an unrelated case, WikiLeaks said.

Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News that \u201cmany prisons have been overcrowded\u201d with \u201cnon-violent drug offenders\u201d in a Wednesday interview addressing criminal justice reform in Washington, D.C. with Breitbart News Deputy Political Editor Amanda House.\n\nHouse asked, \u201cI want to start off with a question that I think is going on in the heads of many conservatives. We don\u2019t have a wall, yet. We haven\u2019t seen real infrastructure reform. We have people still dying in Afghanistan, yet it looks like we\u2019re about to get criminal justice reform with Van Jones. So to those conservatives out there thinking, where is our immigration and health care reform, what do you say to them?\u201d\n\nPaul replied, \u201cYou are, I guess, looking at the world with the glass half-empty. I\u2019m looking at the world with the glass half-full. In fact, I think it\u2019s mostly filled. I think the glass is overflowing to the brim with things we\u2019ve done, so far; regulatory reform, enormous tax cuts, the biggest tax cut since Reagan, two conservative Supreme Court justices. And then we go from there. Those are some big issues.\u201d\n\nPaul added, \u201cWith regard to criminal justice reform, I think it brings both left and right together. Ninety-five percent of people who are in prison, right now, are getting out. They\u2019re going to live in your neighborhood. They\u2019re going to live in your town. Wouldn\u2019t we prefer that they actually learn some skills in prison and learn about work versus going back and being a criminal, again? I think there are a lot of things that right and left came come together on in criminal justice reform. The fact that there are people on the left that I don\u2019t like their ideas on most other things doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t like some of their ideas.\u201d\n\nHouse then asked, \u201cSome conservatives like Sheriff David Clarke, David Lopez, Daniel Horowitz say that this legislation is a jailbreak of sort. Why is it not a jailbreak?\u201d\n\nPaul responded, \u201cI think that, one, we ought to think about whether or not we have any kinds of compassion for people who are in jail. So, for example, if a woman is pregnant and giving birth, should she be shackled? I think it\u2019s a bit obscene that we would actually shackle people while giving birth. So I think there are a lot of things.\u201d\n\nPaul continued, \u201cFor many years, there was disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. It turned out that most people who used crack cocaine were in the African-American community. Most people using powder cocaine were in the white community, and yet we were putting people in jail two and three times longer. Most of these people were African-American. That just wasn\u2019t fair. It\u2019s still not fair. So one of the things that we\u2019ve got is making it retroactive. There are still people in prison for 20 and 30 years for crack cocaine, whereas their counterparts \u2014 who are better off economically and typically white [and] had better attorneys \u2014 got six months probation for the same amount of cocaine some people got a decade or more. I think those things ought to be fixed.\u201d\n\nWatch Full Interview:\n\nHouse inquired, \u201cYou have the president\u2019s support behind this FIRST Step Act, now. You look like you might have enough votes. Are you confident that this bipartisan legislation will go through?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll get 65 or 70 votes,\u201d speculated Paul. \u201cThe key is actually getting to a vote. As you know, the Senate or in the House, unless leadership allows a vote to happen, they control the strings. But there are 65 to 70 votes for this. This really does some modest changes. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything so dramatic in this.\u201d\n\nPaul stated, \u201cWe have to think as a country, Do we really want to incarcerate people \u2014 sometimes for life \u2014 for a non-violent drug crime, or do we want to say, \u2018People make mistakes, and maybe somebody who used drugs in their youth may grow out of that, and I think there\u2019s a very good chance they will.\u2019?\u201d\n\nPaul concluded, \u201cI want to lock up violent people, and I want to make sure that we have room for them. So many prisons have been overcrowded that we\u2019ve released violent criminals early because we\u2019ve got too many people smoking pot that we\u2019re putting in prison. I think we\u2019re wasting a lot of prison space on non-violent drug offenders that would be better used housing violent criminals.\u201d\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Kyle Morris", "title": "Exclusive \u2013 Rand Paul: Next A.G.

Or, even worse, the neocons who believe in unconditional surrender like we had with Japan in World War Two. That\u2019s rarely the way war ends.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky conservative then added that America needs to reach a settlement with Afghanistan in which the United States can finally withdraw troops from the country and end the 17-year long war in Afghanistan. \u201cIt almost never ends with unconditional surrender. It usually ends with a settlement, and in Afghanistan, there needs to be a settlement,\u201d Paul added.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who holds similar America First foreign policy views to Sen.

The Supreme Court is Pakistan\u2019s court of last resort, implying no further appeals should occur following its rulings.\n\nWhile the U.K. has reportedly denied Bibi and her family asylum, Italy, Spain, France, and Canada have allegedly opened their doors.\n\nAsked if the U.S. should follow suit and offer Bibi asylum during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News Deputy Political Editor Amanda House on Wednesday, Paul, a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, responded:\n\nAbsolutely, and I\u2019ve talked to the president about this and my hope is that he will offer her asylum here. This is a woman who is a Christian in a predominantly Muslim nation of Pakistan. She went to draw water from the well in a Muslim village and they began beating her with sticks and stones, and she laid bleeding asking for help. When the police came, they arrested her, not her attackers.\n\nEchoing the Kentucky Republican, human rights groups like Amnesty International have determined that Muslims often use Pakistan\u2019s controversial blasphemy law, which can carry a punishment of life in prison or death, to target Christians and other members of religious minority groups in the Muslim-majority country.\n\nCitizens use the law repeatedly to settle personal disputes and vendettas, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nIn Pakistan, \u201cChristians are very much beleaguered and so are Hindus,\u201d Sen. Paul told Breitbart News. \u201cAny other minority religion [is] beleaguered in Pakistan and if ever there was a call for a refugee to be admitted into our country, I think this is one. \u201d\n\nIn a rare show of bipartisanship, Sens. Paul and Chris Coons (D-DE) introduced a resolution in April calling on Pakistan \u201cto release Aasiya Noreen, internationally known as Asia Bibi, and reform its religiously intolerant laws regarding blasphemy.\u201d\n\nLast Friday, the Khan administration made a pact \u2014 considered a concession to extremists \u2014 with the anti-blasphemy Islamist Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) party that orchestrated the riots that erupted across Pakistan soon after the Supreme Court acquitted Bibi.\n\nUnder the agreement, Islamabad is prohibiting Bibi from leaving the country while the Supreme Court reviews petitions filed against the acquittal verdict. Moreover, the Khan administration agreed not to block a TLP petition to add Bibi to a no-fly list.

The 60-year-old started a five-year term in January 2015.\n\n\u201dIt seems like about 15 minutes ago I was spending a really dreadful day in a not-very-nice hotel suite in Baltimore waiting to see if I could get vote number \u2013 what was I looking for, 23 right?\u201d quipped Manfred, who won the vote to succeed Bud Selig in August 2014 after beating out two other contenders. \u201dIt seems almost impossible that four years have gone by.\u201d\n\nThe owners also signed off on a new television deal with Fox, which still has three seasons to go on its current eight-year contract that pays baseball an average of $525 million per season.\n\nThe seven-year extension, which runs through 2028, will be worth just over $5 billion to MLB \u2013 roughly a 36 percent increase to an average of about $715 million per season.\n\nManfred was asked whether the owners had any reservations to making such a long-term commitment, especially giving the rapidly changing dynamics of the broadcast and online industries.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m a huge believer in the idea that when you have a good partner, even when you\u2019re looking at an uncertain landscape, that good partners find a way to navigate that uncertain landscape,\u201d the commissioner said.\n\nThe relationship with Fox, which began in 1996, will continue to include the World Series and All-Star Game, as well as extensive playoff coverage on both the network and its all-sports cable channel, FS1.\n\nThe new agreement also commits Fox to showing more games from the League Championship Series on its main network, beginning in 2019. It was criticized for televising all but Game 2 in this year\u2019s seven-game NLCS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Milwaukee Brewers on FS1, which has a narrower distribution. Starting next year, two of the first four games and Game 7 will be on Fox.\n\nIn addition to the extension with Fox, MLB also approved a $300 million, three-year with DAZN, a subscription video streaming service run by former ESPN president John Skipper. Manfred called it a key part of baseball\u2019s strategy to reach a new generation of fans.\n\nDAZN will co-produce a nightly highlight show at the MLB Network in Secaucus, New Jersey, and do live cut-ins to games Monday through Friday, an arrangement that steers clear of national broadcast slots held by Fox and ESPN on the weekend.\n\n\u201dThe owners have shown courage, because we are new,\u201d Skipper said. \u201dWe will make sure that young fans have a whip-around show (similar to NFL\u2019s Red Zone) that shows every home run, every highlight. We will get them interested in the game.\u201d\n\nWhile the deals with Manfred, Fox and DAZN were expected , baseball has yet to come to a consensus on the best ways to improve a sport that suffered a 4 percent dip in attendance this season to 69.6 million, plunging to its lowest level since 2003.\n\nManfred and the owners continue to look at ways to speed play . Nine-inning games averaged 3 hours, 4 minutes in 2018. While that was 4 minutes lower than the previous season, it still matched the third-highest average in baseball history.\n\nBaseball\u2019s style of play is also under scrutiny as teams have increasingly become reliant on a home run-or-bust offensive strategy to beat defensive shifts and reliever-heavy pitching staffs that are able to mix and match for almost any situation.\n\nTampa Bay , most notably, even began using relievers to start games, only expecting to get an inning or two out of them before beginning a series of changes. While baseball set a record for homers in 2017 and stayed close to a record level this year, it also had more strikeouts than hits for the first time in 2018 as the cumulative batting average dipped to .248 \u2013 the lowest since 1972, the year before the designated hitter was introduced in the American League.\n\nChris Marinak, MLB\u2019s executive vice president for strategy, technology and innovation, provided owners with a report on those issues. Manfred refused to go into details, saying he preferred to reach a consensus with the players\u2019 union. That includes any decision on a pitch clock, which the owners have the right to impose without union approval under the labor agreement."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Allum Bokhari", "title": "Facebook Blames Human Nature for the Need to Shadowban \u2018Sensationalist and Provocative\u2019 Content", "description": "A lengthy blog post from Mark Zuckerberg explains how Facebook plans to replace its users' preferences.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/11/15/facebook-blames-human-nature-for-the-need-to-shadowban-sensationalist-and-provocative-content/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/afp/15/838db1_mark-zuckerberg-offered-renewed-defense-facebook-handling-russian-misinformation.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:58:02Z", "content": "In a lengthy blog post, the Facebook CEO framed the natural preferences of users as a problem. \u201cLeft unchecked, people will engage disproportionately with more sensationalist and provocative content,\u201d wrote Zuckerberg.

This censorship is purely an outgrowth of Facebook\u2019s worldview, and its determination of what counts as \u201csensational and provocative.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s own research found that posts which were \u201coffensive\u201d but not \u201chate speech\u201d ended up getting more views. Zuckerberg admits that such \u201coffensive\u201d posts will have their engagement artificially limited in future.\n\nInterestingly, our research has found that this natural pattern of borderline content getting more engagement applies not only to news but to almost every category of content. For example, photos close to the line of nudity, like with revealing clothing or sexually suggestive positions, got more engagement on average before we changed the distribution curve to discourage this. The same goes for posts that don\u2019t come within our definition of hate speech but are still offensive.\n\nAgain, the post revealed little about how Facebook determines the \u201coffensiveness\u201d of content, much less why the company has decided that offensiveness is inherently bad. And offensiveness to whom? Will Christians be protected from offense in the same way that Muslims are?\n\nHow Facebook intends to arrive at an objective definition of such words remains a mystery, but it\u2019s clear from the post that machines will be doing the identifying, not humans.\n\nSome categories of harmful content are easier for AI to identify, and in others it takes more time to train our systems. For example, visual problems, like identifying nudity, are often easier than nuanced linguistic challenges, like hate speech. Our systems already proactively identify 96% of the nudity we take down, up from just close to zero a few years ago. We are also making progress on hate speech, now with 52% identified proactively. This work will require further advances in technology as well as hiring more language experts to get to the levels we need.\n\nThe goal, according to Zuckerberg\u2019s post, is to socially engineer Facebook users with new incentives. When users are left to their own devices, they prefer allegedly \u201csensationalist, provocative, and offensive\u201d content that Zucerkberg doesn\u2019t like, so he wants to change that. Users\u2019 old preferences were no good for Facebook, so new ones have to be created.\n\nI believe these efforts on the underlying incentives in our systems are some of the most important work we\u2019re doing across the company. We\u2019ve made significant progress in the last year, but we still have a lot of work ahead. By fixing this incentive problem in our services, we believe it\u2019ll create a virtuous cycle: by reducing sensationalism of all forms, we\u2019ll create a healthier, less polarized discourse where more people feel safe participating.\n\nIn a response to Breitbart News, a Facebook spokeswoman said that the categories of \u201cborderline\u201d content would be publicly disclosed, but did not say if users would be notified when their content is placed in the category and limited.\n\nThe spokeswoman also emphasized that users would have an opt-out \u2014 although opt-outs, if sufficiently hidden from users, are rarely used.\n\n\u201cWe still need to determine exactly what falls in the \u2018borderline\u2019 category\u2014and we are gathering external input as part of that process. While we\u2019re still at the early stages of figuring out these types of details, we will communicate publicly what those categories are.

But they will kill thousands of people during their lifetime. And they\u2019ll get caught and they\u2019ll get 30 days in jail or they will go away for a year or they\u2019ll be fined. And yet if you kill one person, you get the death penalty or you go to jail for life. So if we\u2019re not going to get tough on the drug dealers who kill thousands of people and destroy so many people\u2019s lives, we are just doing the wrong thing. We have got to get tough.\n\nThe First Step Act, though, weakens the penalties for drug traffickers, potentially cutting their prison time in less than half of the current time they spend incarcerated.\n\nIn 2016, Trump blasted Obama for commuting the sentences of criminals, telling his supporters at a Florida rally:\n\nThis is what\u2019s happening to our country. We can\u2019t allow people to come in from very, very hostile and unfriendly territories. We have enough problems. So from Syria, with the migration, we don\u2019t know where these people come from, there\u2019s no way of vetting them \u2026 so here is President Obama has commuted the sentences of more men and women than the past nine presidents put together. And some of these people are bad dudes. \u2026 And these are people that are out, they\u2019re walking the streets, sleep tight folks. Sleep tight. [Emphasis added]\n\nDespite attacks on Obama for releasing convicted felons from prison, under the First Step Act, about 4,000 inmates will be immediately released from prison.\n\nA year before the rally, when he was running against a slew of GOP challengers in the presidential primary, Trump told MSNBC that the U.S. needed to get \u201ctougher\u201d on criminals and drug traffickers, not more lenient \u2014 as the First Step Act ensures. Trump said:\n\nWell, I have to say this, in terms of our cities and in terms of the violent offenses, we have to get a lot tougher. If you look at what\u2019s going on with Baltimore and places like Chicago, where we have great people \u2026 you know I know the chief of police, these are fantastic people. They have to be allowed to do their job \u2026 If they\u2019re allowed to do their job the way they know how to do it, they will stop the onslaught of crime that we have in this country.\n\n\u201cI think that maybe the [drug] dealers have to be looked at very strongly,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn February, it was rumored that Trump even supported executing drug traffickers \u2014 a plan that has been endorsed by countries like Singapore and the Phillippines.\n\nAn anonymous senior official in the Trump White House told Axios that Trump \u201coften jokes about killing drug dealers \u2026 He\u2019ll say, \u2018You know the Chinese and Filipinos don\u2019t have a drug problem. They just kill them.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhite House sources said the president viewed drug dealers of the Mexican drug cartels \u201cas bad as serial killers and should all get the death penalty.\u201d\n\nUnlike Trump\u2019s past statements, the First Step Act allows heroin and fentanyl traffickers to earn early prison release credits, and will allow judges to ignore mandatory minimums for convicted rapists, murderers, and attempted murderers so long as they previously served less than a year in prison.\n\nOver the last few months, ahead of the recent midterm elections, Trump once again made the Rule of Law a priority of his administration\u2019s agenda, saying that it was Democrats who wanted more leniency on criminals, not him.\n\n\u201cRepublicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens,\u201d Trump said at a Kansas rally last month. \u201cAnd Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE, Border Patrol, and law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlue wave means crime. It means open borders. Not good. We need new laws. We need border laws, we need immigration laws \u2014 we need \u2018em fast, we\u2019re going to get \u2018em. Hopefully, the midterms will help toward that end,\u201d Trump said a few months before.\n\nA day before the midterm elections, Trump asked Indiana voters to support Republican Mike Braun for the U.S. Senate, saying that voting for the GOP in the midterms was \u201ca vote to keep your families safe & to keep criminals, traffickers & drug dealers OUT of our Country!\u201d\n\nIn his urging of Arizona voters to support Rep. Martha McSally for Senate, Trump said leniency on crime and drug trafficking was her Democrat opponents\u2019 plan and contrary to his agenda.\n\nArizona is such a Great State but it needs Border Security which @MarthaMcSally will provide, and Krysten Sinema doesn\u2019t even think about. If it were up to Sinema \u2013 drugs, crime and illegal traffic will be flowing into Arizona at an ever increasing pace. Vote for Martha! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2018\n\nTrump touted law enforcement official\u2019s support for his administration\u2019s \u201cLaw and order\u201d platform, but the First Step Act is opposed by the Association of Federal Narcotics Agents, the National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys, the National Association of Police Organizations, National Narcotics Officers\u2019 Associations\u2019 Coalition.\n\nA spokesman with the National Narcotics Officers\u2019 Associations\u2019 Coalition has said the First Step Act \u201cmake[s] heroin and fentanyl traffickers \u2013 responsible for dealing death \u2013 eligible for good time credits that could enable them to re-enter society significantly before their sentence is served.\u201d\n\nThe group of law enforcement organizations sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) saying the prison reform plan \u201cwill threaten public safety\u201d and \u201creduce the sentences of incarcerated violent felons.\n\nLaw Enforcement Officials O\u2026 by on Scribd\n\nConservatives like Sheriff David Clarke, Daniel Horowitz, Star Parker, Maria Espinoza, Eagle Forum President Eunie Smith, and the Center for Security Policy\u2019s Frank Gaffney and Clare Lopez have warned Trump against supporting the First Step Act, noting that it breaks with his hard-on-crime record.\n\n\u201cThe current criminal justice reform legislation is a formula for getting more unreformed criminals \u2013 including drug dealers and jihadists \u2013 back on the streets, threatening public safety and even the national security,\u201d Gaffney said in a statement last month. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t go there.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Trump last month, the group of conservatives called the prison reform bill a \u201cprison release\u201d plan that is opposed by drug trafficking prosecutors.\n\nConservative Leaders Ask Tr\u2026 by on Scribd\n\nBoth political establishments have coalesced around the prison reform bill, including the George Soros-funded pro-open borders American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the billionaire Koch brothers.\n\nA list of about 50 Hollywood celebrities \u2014 nearly all opposed to Trump \u2014 have lobbied to demand the First Step Act be passed and signed into law.\n\nThose celebrities include left-wing actresses like Alyssa Milano and Courtney Cox, as well as anti-Trump Mark Cuban, athlete Benjamin Watson, and social media mogul Kim Kardashian.\n\n\u201cI am proud to stand with this incredible group of artists, content creators, and athletes in urging Congress to pass the First Step Act,\u201d left-wing CNN pundit Van Jones told Rolling Stone. \u201cWho would have thought that a plan to give incarcerated people a better chance would unite people in both parties and at all levels of society?\u201d\n\nThe New York Times editorial board, which Trump has railed against throughout his term thus far, is likewise lobbying for the prison reform bill.\n\nMeanwhile, the vast majority of Americans, nearly 75 percent, oppose reducing penalties for drug traffickers.

A third individual allegedly involved in the data theft was completely unidentified and his or her current whereabouts are said to be unknown.\n\nAccording to the very vague outline of the case given to Reuters, the 48-year-old engineer worked for a chemical company headquartered in Cologne called Lanxess, which was spun off from pharmaceutical giant Bayer. This individual \u201cgained access to large amounts of sensitive data as he moved up Lanxess\u2019s corporate ladder\u201d and began passing it along to an outside accomplice:\n\nIn a senior technical role at Lanxess since February 2010, he sent Chinese-language emails in 2011 and 2013 to an external associate identified as \u201cMr U\u201d, attaching information on a Lanxess-designed reactor and detailed instructions on how to operate it, court documents from the civil case show. Within weeks, U replied by email with a proposal for a rival production site in China. In 2016, the employee co-founded unspecified legal entities to produce and export the copied product from China and the business advertised its new capabilities online and in a press release, according to the documents. The copycat company also touted itself as a future supplier to Lanxess\u2019s customers at trade fairs, the prosecutors\u2019 office said.\n\nThe prosecution of this case seems rather low-key considering the stakes for Lanxess, which is said to have \u201cderived 28 percent of almost 10 billion euros in sales from Asia last year.\u201d\n\nThat sales volume would collapse very quickly if Chinese companies founded with stolen technology began luring away customers. Reuters notes German industrialists are growing nervous about their dependence on the Chinese market, presumably due to the growing risk of copycat companies.\n\nNevertheless, the defendants face only four-year prison sentences if convicted, and Reuters states they \u201care not held on remand because personal circumstances suggest a low risk of absconding\u201d \u2013 a bold assessment given the whereabouts of the third suspect in the case are unknown.\n\nDeutsche Welle noted in a generally upbeat May assessment of Chinese-German economic relations that \u201cGerman and European firms operating in China have long complained about the lack of a level playing field and uneven access to the Asian country\u2019s gigantic market,\u201d as well as Chinese data theft:\n\nProtection of intellectual property is one of the major friction points between China and Germany. \u201cGermany and the US have common interests when it comes to this issue,\u201d said Liu Liqun, professor at the Beijing Foreign Studies University, adding that both Berlin and Washington are of the view that Beijing is not doing enough on this front. \u201cAlthough China has made some progress, it is not enough and China also acknowledges this. I would say it needs more time.\u201d It\u2019s unclear, though, how much leverage Western leaders like Merkel have to persuade Chinese leaders to implement measures needed to tackle these problems, particularly against the backdrop of Beijing\u2019s ambition to become the world\u2019s leading industrial power in the coming decades.\n\n\u201cAt present, the Asian giant is a big buyer of Made-in-Germany goods, but there is growing concern in Berlin that government-supported Chinese firms are increasingly aiming to get their hands on key technologies by acquiring German and European companies in strategic industrial sectors, including robotics, energy systems, and biomedicine,\u201d DW noted."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Pam Key", "title": "Wasserman Schultz: Trump Has \u2018Run Amok,\u2019 House Dems Will Hold Him \u2018Accountable\u2019", "description": "Thursday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMTP Daily,\u201d Rep.

These are folks that have unleashed terror on the community, and now at this time, the government is taking it upon [itself] to set them free.\u201d\n\nAccording to Enada, the Nigerian government released more than 1,200 so-called \u201crepentant\u201d Boko Haram jihadis this year alone, including 500 two months ago, 244 in January, and 475 in February, either claiming they are rehabilitated or citing an inability to charge them with crimes \u201cdue to lack of sufficient evidence against them.\u201d\n\nLast month, the Nigerian military announced that it had released an additional 254 Boko Haram terrorists who \u201csurrendered and repented,\u201d Vanguard reported.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it shows that these insurgents are actually supported, or maybe the government gives them comfort,\u201d Enada argued. \u201cSo now, it just shows anybody anywhere in the world that it is good to terrorize. After all, if [the terrorists] say [they] have repented, they will be granted a reprieve or they will be reintegrated into [the] community.\u201d\n\nThe activist accused the Buhari administration of \u201cobstructing justice\u201d by releasing the jihadis.\n\n\u201cOur judicial system is clear that criminal elements and terrorist activities are subject to prosecution,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor government not to submit these insurgents for prosecution means they are obstructing justice.\u201d\n\nHe conceded that it is unclear what happens to the Boko Haram terrorists after they are released, noting that he does not know whether they assimilated into society or if they are planning to \u201cunleash terror again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what this has actually shown everybody is that the act of terrorism in Nigeria is not bad because [the] government will definitely forgive you if you come out and say you are sorry,\u201d he continued.\n\nIn Nigeria, Christians have suffered persecution at the hands of Boko Haram in the northeastern part of the country and Muslim Fulani herdsmen in the Middle Belt area.\n\n\u201cOver the summer, it was reported that as many as 6,000 people, mostly women and children, have been murdered by Fulani herdsmen since January,\u201d the Christian Post pointed out.\n\nEnada acknowledged that the Buhari administration has repeatedly made the false assertion that his administration has defeated Boko Haram.\n\nSince taking office in 2015, the Buhari administration has claimed victory over Boko Haram several times only to have the terrorist group carry out deadly attacks soon after the allegation.\n\n\u201cIt has been explained away by the government that Boko Haram has been decimated,\u201d Enada told the Christian Post. \u201cBut that is not true because most of the attacks on soft targets are still going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not eradicated. If the government says that Boko Haram has been eradicated, that is a big lie,\u201d Enada added. \u201cI keep on telling people that when you talk about these insurgents in Nigeria, our government has actually paid some lip service to it.\u201d"}]
