(Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHow much should a pitcher's win total matter when voting for the Cy Young?\n\nNot much these days.\n\nJacob deGrom won the prestigious award on Wednesday in the National League despite winning just 10 games \u2013 the lowest win total ever for a starting Cy Young winner. Seattle Mariners pitcher Felix Hernandez had 13 victories when he won the 2010 AL Cy Young.\n\n\"This confirms the Cy Young is an award not only for the pitcher with the most wins but the most dominant,\" said Hernandez in 2010.\n\nIndeed.\n\nThe New York Mets ace received 29 of 30 first-place votes for 207 total points in voting conducted by the Baseball Writers' Association of America at the end of the regular season.\n\nWashington Nationals ace Max Scherzer, who won eight more games than deGrom, received one first-place votes for 123 total points, followed by the Philadelphia Phillies' Aaron Nola, who won 17 games and finished third in the race with 86 points.\n\nDespite his 10-9 record, deGrom was recognized for his historic season and wasn't penalized for his lack of \"W's\" because of the poor offense behind him. Among the 58 qualifying starting pitchers this season, deGrom finished second to last in run support average (3.53). In comparison, Scherzer, with 18 wins, finished 10th (5.27), Nola 53rd (3.79).\n\nDeGrom's credentials are unprecedented. He finished with a minuscule 1.70 ERA, sixth lowest among qualifiers since the mound was lowered to its current height in 1969. It's the second-best ERA by a starting pitcher this decade -- Zack Greinke finished with a 1.66 ERA in 2016.\n\nOpponents hit .142 with one home run in 150 plate appearances with runners in scoring position. Even more remarkably, he had 18 starts in which he went at least six innings and allowed one or zero earned runs, and set a record with 29 straight starts allowing three runs or fewer.\n\nFor the season, he finished second behind Scherzer in the NL in strikeouts (269) \u2013 fourth-most in Mets history \u2013 innings (217) and WHIP (0.91).\n\n\"Obviously (Max) Scherzer and (Aaron) Nola had great seasons, but for Jake to go out there and do what he did without getting run support and have to pitch through bad defense, there were very few pitches that were kind of under no-stress,\" catcher Devin Mesoraco said in a phone interview with USA TODAY Network.\n\n\"Every outing, the tying run was at the plate or in the on-deck circle, and it makes what Jacob did even more impressive.\"\n\n2018 NL Cy Young: Jacob deGrom.\n\n\n\nFull voting details: https://t.co/MA26uVnQg6 \u2014 BBWAA (@officialBBWAA) November 14, 2018\n\nScherzer, the three-time and reigning NL Cy Young winner, had arguably his most dominant season. He led the majors in strikeouts (300) and innings pitched (220 \u2154). Neither the Nationals nor Mets had a successful season, which ultimately favored deGrom.\n\nNola went 17-6 in 33 starts. He ranked second in the NL in ERA (2.37), fifth in strikeouts (224) and opponents' batting average (.197).\n\nIn claiming the award, deGrom becomes the first Mets pitcher to win since R.A. Dickey in 2012.\n\n\"I don't know how anybody ever beats him,\" said Atlanta Braves manager Brian Snitker after deGrom's final start, an eight-inning shutout performance at Citi Field. \"You don't like to face him. But you know what? When you do face him, man, you appreciate what he is and what he can do.\"\n\nContributing: Matt Ehalt\n\nFollow Boeck on Twitter @scott_boeck"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Comic writers reflect on Stan Lee's take on race", "description": "As fans celebrate Stan Lee's contributions to the pop culture canon, some have also revisited how Lee felt that with his comic books came great responsibility.

(AP) \u2014 Thomas Davis said Carolina's most recent loss could turn out to be a positive for the Panthers moving forward.\n\nThat's why Davis thanked Steelers coach Mike Tomlin at midfield for \"humbling\" the Panthers after his team put up 52 points on Carolina's once-vaunted defense last Thursday night.\n\nThe 13-year NFL veteran explained Wednesday that the embarrassing performance might have been just what Carolina (6-3) needed to regain its focus on defense, for players to get on the same page and make a playoff run beginning this Sunday when the Panthers visit the Lions.\n\n\"If you are true competitor, you want to bounce back and you want to do something about it,\" Davis said. \"I'm a competitor and I want to get that taste out of my mouth.\"\n\nThe Panthers have been a perennial top 10 defense since middle linebacker Luke Kuechly's arrival in 2012, making their performance against Pittsburgh all that much more surprising. The Steelers scored on seven of their first eight possessions; the only time they failed to do so was when they took a knee before halftime to run out the clock.\n\n\"It's not something that happens a lot around here,\" Kuechly said of surrendering 52 points.\n\nThings have gone so well for Carolina on defense in recent years that the last two coordinators left to take head coaching jobs \u2014 Sean McDermott in Buffalo and Steve Wilks in Arizona.\n\nBut things aren't going so well for Eric Washington, Carolina's third defensive coordinator in three seasons.\n\nThe Panthers are 15th in the league overall and 31st in red zone defense.\n\nWashington said a \"myriad of things\" went wrong against the Steelers.\n\n\"We had execution issues,\" said Washington, the team's defensive line coach from 2011-2017. \"... We have calls, we have leverage, we have gap responsibility. We have things that we have to do from one down to the next in terms of our assignment. And we did not get that done.\"\n\nWashington's body of work as a defensive line coach was impressive.\n\nSince 2012, the Panthers have more gotten more sacks from their defensive linemen (234) than any team in the league. So for the Panthers to have only 22 sacks this season is disappointing to him.\n\n\"We're his pride and joy,\" defensive tackle Kawann Short said. \"That's one of those things where he demands more out of us, and he knows what every guy in that room is capable of.\"\n\nThe Panthers didn't watch game film from Steelers loss as a team, instead electing to move on to preparations for Detroit. But Short said it feels like players are trying to do too much on their own instead of playing as a team.\n\n\"We just need to light our hair on fire, and just go,\" Short said.\n\nWashington called the Steelers game an \"anomaly,\" guaranteeing the Panthers will rectify their problems.\n\nWhen players returned from a long weekend off he reminded them of this team's long-standing identity as a defensive power, as well as the amount of talent in the locker room. Along with defensive end Julius Peppers, Kuechly has a chance to be a Hall of Famer.\n\n\"We have a high opinion of what we should be able to do every time we step on the football field,\" Washington said.\n\nKuechly said now it's time to focus on Detroit.\n\n\"One game doesn't define a season,\" Kuechly said. \"And I don't think you can waste time thinking about something in the past when you play a good team this week.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nWarriors forward Kevin Durant will become a free agent next season. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWhen Kevin Durant decided to join the Golden State Warriors during free agency in the summer of 2016, he ended up signing a one-plus-one contract.\n\nA one-plus-one deal is a two-year contract, but it allows the player to become a free agent after one season if he chooses. It\u2019s a move LeBron James popularized when he returned to Cleveland in 2014, and it works for the player in two ways.\n\nThat deal allows a player to sign for more money the following season \u2013 even with the same team \u2013 if there\u2019s a significant spike in the NBA\u2019s salary cap. It also gives the player more freedom in free agency. He isn\u2019t locked into a long-term deal and can explore options sooner and more frequently.\n\nThat ability to become a free agent season after season is a root problem of the Draymond Green-Kevin Durant dust-up that threatens to torpedo the good thing Golden State has going.\n\nThe recent confrontation stems from an end-of-the-game play Monday against the Los Angeles Clippers in which Green committed a turnover as the fourth quarter expired. Durant, who had a 30-point triple-double, clamored for the basketball. Durant expressed his frustration at the end of regulation, and Green lashed out with the disagreement continuing after Golden State\u2019s overtime loss. According to The Athletic, Green called Durant an expletive and chastised him for dangling his contract situation over the franchise\u2019s collective head.\n\nAh yes, the contract. Durant chose free agency again in 2017 after helping Golden State to a title and re-resigned on another one-plus-one deal. He took the free agency route again in July after helping the Warriors to a second consecutive title in 2018 and re-signed another one-plus-one deal.\n\nDurant can become a free agent again after this season, creating the contractual turmoil and roster uncertainty that Golden State has been able to avoid with other players.\n\nThat kind of deal is good for the player but not always good for the team, which can feel like a hostage \u2013 always wondering if this is the player\u2019s last season. But Durant earned that right. He\u2019s an MVP and two-time Finals MVP. Not many players \u2013 perhaps only the top five players in the league \u2013 can pull off the one-plus-one deals season after season. Most players want the long-term security and guaranteed money.\n\nBut Durant and James can do it because of their unbelievable talents and because they have other sources of significant income such as endorsement deals and investments.\n\nMORE NBA:\n\nDurant\u2019s contract situation is a constant topic as Golden State tries to minimize distractions and win another title, adding to their dynasty. It doesn\u2019t make the situation any easier with increasing speculation that Durant will leave after this season. Multiple Eastern Conference executives are bracing for Durant to sign with the New York Knicks in July.\n\nIt leaves Golden State in a predicament. In some way, they must cater to the superstar, and in the case of Durant vs. Green, they have to choose a side, if they want the superstar to return. As good and integral as Green is, he\u2019s not Durant. If a team had to choose one or the other, a team chooses Durant.\n\nBy suspending Green one game without pay, they run the risk of alienating Green while trying to appease Durant.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Green and Durant have butted heads. How the two players and the team emerge from this recent dust-up will impact this season. But no matter which direction the relationship goes, Durant\u2019s contract still hangs over the team\u2019s present and future.\n\nFollow Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Ryan Zinke: Not time 'to point fingers' over wildfires", "description": "U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke visits the aftermath of California's deadliest wildfire and says it's not the time to \"point fingers.\" (Nov. 14)", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/14/ryan-zinke-not-time-point-fingers-over-wildfires/38530853/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1473eb93b234e9f96674e6245c4eeaa2312a8460/c=0-52-1024-631&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2018/03/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636565579444150329-ZINKE.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T23:41:19Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, From staff and wire reports, USA TODAY", "title": "AP: Michael Avenatti arrested in Los Angeles following domestic violence incident", "description": "Michael Avenatti, the attorney who rose to prominence representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in her legal pursuit against President Donald Trump, is in police custody in Los Angeles following an allegation of domestic violence, a law enforcement official to\u2026", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/14/michael-avenatti-arrested-following-domestic-violence-incident/2006582002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/09/26/USAT/ad0cf84a-dd7a-4c6f-a505-dc0431666dcb-AP_Trump_Porn_Star.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y218&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T23:41:06Z", "content": "Michael Avenatti, attorney for porn actress Stormy Daniels, talks to reporters after a federal court hearing in Los Angeles, Sept. 24, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 Marcus Mariota and the Tennessee Titans finally are starting to show signs that some of their growing pains of learning a new offense may be easing.\n\nThe quarterback had to learn his third new scheme going into his fourth NFL season. The Titans are leaning on a lot of young receivers and coordinator Matt LaFleur's experience calling plays grows with each game. The changes, along with the loss of three-time Pro Bowl tight end Delanie Walker in the opener, led to some early struggles on offense.\n\nNow Mariota is feeling comfortable enough with the offense and LaFleur to speak up when the game plan features something he doesn't like.\n\n\"I just feel as though I've gotten a better understanding of the offense, why we're calling certain things,\" Mariota said Wednesday. \"Maybe why he wants a particular play against certain coverage, so having that understanding I think has allowed me to have confidence in going in and saying, 'Hey, maybe I don't really like that. I'm not feeling that.'\"\n\nMariota said previously he might not have known how a play would look or work on the field.\n\n\"Having confidence in it, being in the offense a little longer has definitely helped that,\" Mariota said.\n\nThe results might not show up in NFL rankings with the Titans (5-4) 30th in total offense and 18th averaging 18.7 points a game.\n\nThe offensive turnaround started Oct. 21 in London in a 20-19 loss to the Chargers and includes a 28-14 win in Dallas and last weekend's 34-10 rout of the Patriots. In those three games, the Titans have converted 61 percent (25 of 41) of their third downs, which is best in the NFL in that span.\n\nMariota has posted his best passer ratings of the season in each of the past two games, and he has 542 total yards passing, running and catching with five touchdowns. His lone interception in the three-game stretch came in the second quarter against the Chargers\n\nCorey Davis finished with seven catches for 125 yards against Dallas, his second 100-yard receiving game this season. Tight end Jonnu Smith had a career-high 45 yards receiving on three catches with a TD. Even rookie Cameron Batson, who spent three weeks on the practice squad earlier this season, has had four catches for 47 yards over the past two games.\n\nRunning back Dion Lewis believes everyone has gotten comfortable with each other.\n\n\"It's a lot of bumps in the road when you're learning,\" Lewis said. \"You make a mistake, and you try not to make the same mistake again. I think that's what everybody's trying to do knowing what the coaches expect from them. And if they messed up something in the past, just move on forward and not make that same mistake. I think if guys do that, we can keep building on that as an offense and keep getting better.\"\n\nThe results are easy to see with the Titans, who went through an eight-quarter drought without scoring a touchdown during a three-game skid in October. They followed up a season-high 28 points in Dallas with the best first quarter (17) and first half (24) of scoring since Nov. 13, 2016, against Green Bay.\n\nThe Titans are 13th in the NFL holding the ball 30 minutes, 30 seconds per game.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Ezekiel Elliott paused and lowered his voice when asked what he was doing when the Dallas Cowboys played without their star running back for the first time during his six-game suspension last year.\n\nNot only was Elliott having a self-described \"tough time\" with the NFL's ban over domestic violence allegations finally in place after weeks of court battles, but he had to watch a dreadful offensive showing by the Cowboys in a blowout loss to Atlanta. The 27-7 defeat started a three-game losing streak that wiped out any realistic playoff hopes.\n\n\"I was home watching it,\" Elliott said Wednesday. \"Tough to watch. Tough time for me. I'm glad I'm out there this year and able to help my guys go out there and try to get this win.\"\n\nIt's relevant because the Cowboys (4-5) are visiting the Falcons (4-5) again Sunday, nearly in the same spot on the schedule, in more dire need of a win because of an uneven first-half performance, particularly by the offense.\n\nJust like last year, though \u2014 when Elliott refused upon his return to the team to discuss already-public details about his time away \u2014 Elliott didn't last long talking about the drama surrounding his suspension, and the impact it had on the Cowboys.\n\n\"That's all behind me,\" he said. \"It's hard to even need extra motivation when you're 4-5. For the rest of this season, our backs are up against the wall. We have to do the best we can to go out there and try to win every one of these last games. And those guys on their side, they're feeling the same way.\"\n\nThe next two questions were brushed aside. \"I really don't want to dwell on last year,\" Elliott said.\n\nFour-time Pro Bowl right guard Zack Martin didn't even remember last year's Atlanta game was the first without Elliott.\n\n\"I know you guys want to talk about it,\" Martin said. \"That really hasn't come up at all this year.\"\n\nElliott and the Dallas offense have had a rough season, even with a running game that has ranked in the top five most of the season.\n\nBut the 2016 NFL rushing champion as a rookie is coming off one of his best games of the year in a season-saving 27-20 win at defending champion Philadelphia. Elliott had 151 yards rushing with a touchdown and 36 yards receiving with another score \u2014 and a TD he lost by stumbling in the open field after almost cleanly hurdling a defender and landing in stride.\n\n\"You do have a little bit more momentum,\" Elliott said. \"When you have a game like that last week, this Falcons team is going to be that much more clued into the run. It's not going to be easy.\"\n\nThe Cowboys recovered from the downer of losing Elliott to win the last three without him last season. Then they compounded the disappointment by losing his first game back to Seattle when Dallas still had faint playoff hopes.\n\nThat defeat eliminated the Cowboys a year after an NFC-best 13 wins during the remarkable debut seasons for Elliott and quarterback Dak Prescott, the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nFast-forward a year, and Elliott is still second in the league with 831 yards rushing despite an offense ranked 27th overall, and a group of blockers that has struggled since losing four-time Pro Bowl center Travis Frederick to a nerve disorder before the season started. Frederick's return this season looks less likely each week.\n\n\"I think he's handled it all really, really well,\" coach Jason Garrett said of Elliott . \"He wants to be a great player, wants to have a big impact on our team. I thought he handled a lot of the distractions last year very well. He came back from them and now he's focused on those same things that we always thought he was all about.\"\n\nAnd happy to be playing the Falcons instead of watching from home.\n\nNOTES: LT Tyron Smith was added to the injury report with a back issue Wednesday. He didn't practice. ...

One week after signing, then losing receiver Dez Bryant to an injury, the Saints welcomed another aging star, Brandon Marshall, to their receiver corps. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMETAIRIE, La. (AP) \u2014 Brandon Marshall takes nothing for granted when discussing his opportunity to join the Saints' seemingly inevitable march to the postseason.\n\n\"Let's not jump ahead. I've got a lot of learning to do and a lot of catching up,\" Marshall said after his first practice with New Orleans on Wednesday. \"I've been at the top and I'm on the bottom right now.\"\n\nBy bottom, the 34-year-old Marshall means getting cut repeatedly in the past couple seasons, most recently by Seattle a couple weeks ago.\n\nEven after he worked out for New Orleans (8-1) last week, Marshall wasn't the Saints' top choice. New Orleans went instead with Dez Bryant, but lost the former Dallas Cowboys star to a season-ending Achilles injury in his second practice.\n\n\"When you're on the other side of 30 and you don't produce, this is the situation you'll find yourself in,\" Marshall said. \"Being cut two times in a year is interesting. It built a lot of character. ... When Seattle cut me, I just continued to work out, stay in shape and have faith.\"\n\nMarshall had flown back to his temporary home in Seattle after his Saints tryout, only to hop back on a flight to New Orleans again on Sunday afternoon, while the offense he was about to join was putting up 51 points in Cincinnati.\n\nAnkle and toe injuries cost Marshall most of his 2017 season with the New York Giants, who didn't bring him back, leaving him free to sign with the Seahawks. Marshall said he wasn't full healthy until around Week 3 or 4 of this season which, ironically, was about the time his snap count began to plummet in Seattle.\n\n\"I know that the narrative is that I'm done,\" Marshall said.\n\nYet Marshall predicted he'd demonstrate in practice that between his 6-foot-5 frame, route-running, strong hands, and ability to quickly grasp offensive schemes, that he can still help a team with playoff credentials. Marshall noted that because he played in Chicago under then-offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer, a former offensive assistant to Saints coach Sean Payton, he is familiar with New Orleans' scheme.\n\nPayton called Marshall's ability to process a play book \"one of his strengths,\" adding that he expects Marshall's transition in New Orleans \"to be pretty smooth.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Marshall described the opportunity to play with Saints record-setting QB Drew Brees \"a wide receiver's dream.\" Likewise, Brees was quick to throw a few compliments Marshall's way.\n\n\"He's a smart, veteran guy who is very fluid. I've seen him in a lot of different offenses \u2014 seen him be successful both as an outside receiver, an inside receiver. He's very versatile. He's a big target. A big catching radius. Just watching him run today, he's pretty impressive.\n\n\"We talked for a while today,\" Brees added. \"He's excited. We're excited to have him.\"\n\nMarshall's addition adds depth to an offense that already leads the NFL in scoring with 36.7 points per game and ranks in the top five in yards per game with 413.9.\n\nSeattle released Marshall on Oct. 30 after he'd appeared in the first seven games this season, catching 11 passes for 136 yards and one touchdown. But he had just two catches for 16 yards in his last four games.\n\nSeattle was the sixth NFL team for Marshall, who has eight 1,000-plus-yard seasons in his career. His best season, statistically, came with the New York Jets in 2015, when he caught 109 passes for 1,502 yards and 14 touchdowns.\n\nEven now, Marshall insisted, his motivation remains to achieve \"greatness.\"\n\n\"There's no reason why, with technology and modern medicine and with access we have to doctors around the world, why athletes can't play into their mid-30s or their 40s,\" Marshall said, stressing that he now feels \"fit as a fiddle and healthy as a trout.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear whether Marshall will play much, if at all this Sunday against Philadelphia. But Eagles coach Doug Pederson said his defense has to be prepared for the possibility.\n\n\"He's, I think, a red-zone threat with his size and so I think that's where we'll see him a little bit, is down there,\" Pederson said. \"He's another big, physical receiver, hard to defend and our guys definitely have their work cut out this week.\"\n\nNotes: Starting left tackle Terron Armstead did not practice. He was listed on the injury report as having a shoulder injury. Veteran Jermon Bushrod is filling in, resuming the role he occupied on New Orleans' 2009 Super Bowl championship squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Case Keenum is off to a rocky start in the shadows of John Elway, Peyton Manning and the Rocky Mountains, which he and his wife, Kimberly, visited during the Broncos' much-needed bye week.\n\n\"It's pretty. I've been looking at them for the last six months,\" Keenum said. \"So, it was fun to go up there and enjoy that. It was good to get away.\"\n\nNot that he was scrambling from the pressure and high expectations of playing in quarterback-crazed Denver, the magnitude of which he insists doesn't faze him.\n\n\"Yeah, there's a lot to it, playing quarterback here, and I enjoy it, I love it, I love the intensity of it. I love the tradition, the history,\" Keenum told The Associated Press on his way to the weight room after practice Wednesday.\n\nAs if on cue, Keenum triggered an automatic door leading from the facility to the parking lot that separates the weight room from the rest of the team's headquarters.\n\nHe pointed to the larger-than-life photos of Broncos greats that decorate the walls and halls of the UC Health Center.\n\n\"I mean, you walk in and the pictures are right there of who's played here and what they've done,\" Keenum said. \"So, I don't take it lightly. I love my job. I love what I do. Personally, I feel like I've got the best job in the world.\"\n\nEven though it comes with such little patience from the boo-birds at the stadium and the longtime listeners/first-time callers smarting over the Broncos' 3-6 start, Keenum's 10 interceptions and two dozen sacks in his Denver debut.\n\nKeenum knew Denver was different from his other NFL stops when he signed with the Broncos for two years and $36 million after leading the Vikings to the NFC championship game.\n\n\"I love it. And I understand that there's pressure and expectations that come with it,\" Keenum said. \"I've had those pressures and those expectations on myself my whole career, my whole life. Every time I step on the field I want to win. I expect to win and I expect to do well.\n\n\"So, that's me, that's who I am and I think that's why I'm built to play quarterback here.\"\n\nHis new workplace, where three Lombardi Trophies loom large in the lobby, isn't anything like Keenum's stops in Houston, where he also played college ball; St. Louis, where they were about to lose a franchise; L.A., where those Rams weren't yet these Rams; and Minnesota, where he subbed for Sam Bradford.\n\nHere, the fans let their beloved Broncos hear about it the first time a pass is off target.\n\n\"That's just the fan base here, they expect good things, they expect explosive plays, they expect offense,\" Keenum said. \"And I love that they care, I really do. I'd rather them be that way than nobody shows up. I'd rather play in front of all those fans that are into the game than just some other fans \u2014 not to mention any other fans out there \u2014 that come for the tailgate and the party. They want football and I appreciate that.\"\n\nBut for three plays, the Broncos could be 6-3 instead of 3-6 heading into their game against the Chargers (7-2) this weekend.\n\n\u2014 Keenum missed a wide-open Demaryius Thomas for the game-winning TD in the final minute of a 27-23 loss to Kansas City that helped grow the legend of Patrick Mahomes.\n\n\u2014 Emmanuel Sanders' taunting flag after an apparent touchdown cost Denver four points in a 23-20 loss to the Rams.\n\n\u2014 Brandon McManus pushed a 51-yard field goal wide right as time expired in a 19-17 loss to the Texans.\n\nWith the Broncos flirting with back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since 1971-72, fans are left wondering whether Keenum is the answer at quarterback or if there was anything to general manager John Elway going to watch Oregon QB Justin Herbert last month.\n\nThey've seen a succession of quarterbacks flame out in Denver following Manning's retirement a month after the Broncos' Super Bowl parade 33 months ago:\n\n\u2014 Mark Sanchez was cut in camp.\n\n\u2014 Trevor Siemian kept getting hurt and eventually was traded.\n\n\u2014 Brock Osweiler was brought back in 2017 but not re-signed in 2018.\n\n\u2014 Paxton Lynch, a first-round bust.\n\n\u2014 Chad Kelly, a backup who got arrested.\n\nIf the Broncos had beaten the Chiefs (9-1), Rams (9-1) and Texans (6-3), maybe the buzz is all about a long-term extension for Keenum instead of whether he's the right quarterback to lead the Broncos' revival.\n\n\"That's not in my mind,\" Keenum said. \"During the season I'm taking it one game at a time.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson have faced off in a few memorable games in Seattle, from the \"Fail Mary\" to an unforgettable NFC championship game that sent the Seahawks to their second straight Super Bowl.\n\nFor the fifth straight regular season \u2014 and the seventh time overall since 2012 \u2014 Green Bay and Seattle will meet again on Thursday night, but this time it's positioning in a jumbled NFC playoff picture at stake.\n\nWashington, New Orleans, Chicago and the Los Angeles Rams are the division leaders in the NFC, leaving a pile of seven teams \u2014 including Seattle and Green Bay \u2014 within a couple of games of each other likely competing for the two wild-card spots. And every advantage or tiebreaker in that race \u2014 such as a head-to-head victory \u2014 could end up being crucial.\n\n\"I know that this team is very, very capable of doing what we're setting out to do,\" Wilson said. \"I think everybody should watch out (for) what we can do.\"\n\nSeattle (4-5) has dropped two straight after winning four of the previous five, and hasn't lost three straight since the middle of the 2011 season. Green Bay (4-4-1) snapped a two-game losing streak with a 31-12 thumping of Miami last week.\n\nThe \"Fail Mary\" in 2012, the 2014 season opener when Seattle raised its Super Bowl banner and the NFC title game after the 2014 season are the only three times Rodgers has lost to the Seahawks in his career.\n\nThe past two matchups with Seattle have been among Rodgers' best, throwing for 311 yards in a 17-9 win to open last season and in 2016 posting a 150.8 passer rating in a 38-10 Green Bay rout.\n\nHe also has the distinction of having won in Seattle \u2014 although that came 10 years ago.\n\n\"It's a tough environment like I said but we've definitely done it before,\" Rodgers said. \"You've just got to start fast, take care of the football. They're very good at turning the ball over. I know this is different personnel on their side of the ball than we've seen over the years, but they're still playing really well.\"\n\nRodgers and Wilson are being helped this year by improved run games that are among the best in the league. Green Bay's Aaron Jones leads the NFL in yards per carry, while Seattle has the No. 1 rushing offense and last week rushed for 273 yards against the Rams without starting running back Chris Carson.\n\nHere's what else to watch for on Thursday night:\n\nFIRST UP\n\nSeattle expects Carson to be available after missing last Sunday's game with a hip injury. If Carson can go, he will be the starter. But Seattle finally saw the promise of rookie first-round pick Rashaad Penny last week when he rushed for 108 yards on 12 carries and a touchdown. Penny showed the burst and big-play ability that had been missing through the first half of the season.\n\nExpect Penny to get additional chances no matter Carson's health as the Seahawks look to use its three-back trio \u2014 Carson, Penny, Mike Davis \u2014 all of whom have 100-yard rushing games this season.\n\nSECONDARY MATTERS\n\nAnother week, another lineup shuffle likely in the Green Bay secondary. Kentrell Brice was walking in the locker room with a boot on his left foot early in the week, making it appear unlikely that he will be ready to go on a short turnaround.\n\nThe Packers traded Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to Washington two weeks ago. Jermaine Whitehead was released last week. No Brice would mean probably mean veteran Tramon Williams and second-year player Josh Jones starting at safety. Kevin King (hamstring) also appears likely to miss another game, while fellow cornerback Bashaud Breeland (groin) was limited during the week.\n\nHERE'S JIMMY\n\nTight end Jimmy Graham is returning to Seattle for the first time since signing with the Packers as a free agent in the offseason. With just two touchdowns so far this year, Graham perhaps hasn't had quite the impact in the end zone as in 2017, when he had 10 scores with Seattle.\n\nBut with 33 catches through nine games, Graham in on pace to match the production he had with the Seahawks. He's also taking pride in his run-blocking, and his part in helping Aaron Jones run for career highs of 145 yards and two scores last week.\n\n\"I know everybody knows me for running go routes and snagging touchdowns, but I think I've dedicated myself to the run, to being a part of that because I'm a tight end now,\" Graham said on Sunday. \"For us to be successful I've got to do those things and I've got to be good at them.\"\n\nQUICK TURNAROUND\n\nBecause of the quick turnaround from last Sunday several players have been ruled out. Along with Brice and King, the Packers have also ruled out wide receiver Randall Cobb and linebacker Nick Perry.\n\nSeattle linebacker K.J. Wright was listed as doubtful because of a knee injury that knocked him out of last Sunday's game early. Carroll said Wright would be a game-time decision. Seattle sat Carson and guard D.J. Fluker against the Rams and both appear set to play against the Packers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After a season marred by narrow defeats, Jacob deGrom became a runaway winner.\n\nThe New York Mets ace easily won the National League Cy Young Award on Wednesday night, a reward for a historically fruitless season in Flushing. The right-hander had just 10 victories, the fewest ever by a Cy Young-winning starter.\n\nThe AL prize also reflected a change in voters' values, with Blake Snell of the Tampa Bay Rays narrowly beating out past winners Justin Verlander and Corey Kluber for his first Cy Young. Snell pitched just 180 2/3 innings, fewest ever by a Cy Young-winning starter. Over full seasons, Snell is the second starter to win the award with fewer than 200 innings after Clayton Kershaw logged 198 1/3 in 2014.\n\n\"I definitely think the game has changed in that aspect,\" deGrom said.\n\n\"I feel like it's just turning more into quality of work and what did you accomplish in those innings,\" Snell said. \"I think that's just the way it's going.\"\n\nDeGrom easily beat out Washington's Max Scherzer, who was seeking a third straight Cy Young and fourth overall. DeGrom got 29 first-place votes and 207 points from members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Scherzer had the other first-place vote.\n\nIn his first season after chopping off his distinctive long hair, deGrom cut down hitters from start to finish despite little help from teammates. He had a 1.70 ERA, the lowest in the NL since Zack Greinke's 1.66 mark in 2015. Yet the 30-year-old right-hander went 10-9, eclipsing the low bar among starters of 13 victories set by the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela in 1981 and matched by Seattle's Felix Hernandez in 2010.\n\nDeGrom allowed three runs or fewer in 29 consecutive starts to close the season, breaking Leslie \"King\" Cole's 108-year-old record of 26 such outings. Yet the Mets were 11-18 in those games and 14-18 overall with deGrom on the mound.\n\n\"My thought process was, 'Hey, take the ball every fifth day and continue to try to put this team in position to win and control what you can control,'\" deGrom said.\n\nHernandez's Cy Young victory signaled a major shift from voters, who once prioritized pitcher wins. The push toward advanced analytics made deGrom's candidacy possible, and by September there was little debate deGrom was worthy, even as the Mets regularly wasted his dominance.\n\n\"This was one of my goals,\" deGrom said. \"The team didn't end up where we wanted to be this past season, but you kind of set personal goals, and I think being able to accomplish something that has been a dream of yours is just something special. To be a Cy Young Award winner, you're in great company, and it truly is an honor.\"\n\nPerhaps no pitcher had ever been such a hard-luck loser. New York averaged 3.5 runs in games started by deGrom, second only to Cole Hamels for worst support in the majors among qualified pitchers. During one stretch late in the season, the Mets totaled 10 runs over seven of deGrom's outings, and four of those were driven in by the pitcher himself.\n\nDeGrom nearly produced more wins above replacement than actual wins \u2014 an unfortunate sabermetric feat that has only been accomplished once, when the Philadelphia Athletics' Eddie Smith went 4-17 with 4.1 WAR in 1937. Baseball-Reference calculated deGrom for 9.6 WAR.\n\nThe 2014 NL Rookie of the Year, he became the seventh rookie winner voted a Cy Young, joining fellow Mets Tom Seaver and Dwight Gooden. R.A. Dickey was the only other Met to win a Cy Young.\n\nThe Mets unveiled a deGrom bobblehead featuring the Cy Young Award shortly after deGrom was crowned. They will give away 25,000 prior to a home game April 7 against Scherzer's Nationals.\n\nSnell got 17 first-place votes and 169 points to 13 first-place votes and 154 points for Verlander. Kluber had 71 points, followed by Boston's Chris Sale and Houston's Gerrit Cole.\n\nSnell had a 1.89 ERA, third best in the AL since the DH was introduced, trailing only Ron Guidry (1.74) in 1978 and Pedro Martinez (1.74) in 2000. The 25-year-old pitched had 33 1/3 fewer innings than Verlander, but his dominance was enough to sway the electorate.\n\nThe lefty nicknamed Snellzilla wreaked havoc against the AL's top lineups. He was 3-0 with a 1.08 ERA in four starts against the World Series champion Red Sox, and 2-0 in two starts each against the Astros and Indians. The Yankees roughed Snell up twice, but he got threw five scoreless innings in a victory Aug. 16. That came during a late-season run of nine consecutive wins for Snell, including a victory against every team in the AL East. He also made five starts against former Cy Young winners and went 3-0 with an 0.59 ERA.\n\nSnell was the first player 25-or-younger to win 21 games since Barry Zito in 2002. He was highly regarded as a minor leaguer for his electric arsenal, but subpar control led to struggles during his first two major league seasons. He was even demoted to Triple-A for a month in 2017.\n\nIt all came together this year. Snell was a stalwart for a most unusual pitching staff, taking the ball every fifth day while manager Kevin Cash successfully experimented with reliever \"openers\" to start games in between. Snell led the Rays with 31 starts, and no other traditional starter had more than 17. After longtime franchise ace Chris Archer was traded to the Pirates on July 31, Snell went 9-0 with a 1.17 ERA.\n\n\"I felt with the opener, I had a bigger role on the team,\" Snell said.\n\nSnell is the second Rays pitcher to win the award, following David Price in 2012.\n\nScherzer went 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and led the majors with 220 2/3 innings and 300 strikeouts. He was attempting to become the first player since Randy Johnson to win three consecutive Cy Youngs. He got the first-place vote of John Maffei of the San Diego Union-Tribune, 29 seconds and 123 points. Aaron Nola of the Philadelphia Phillies was third with 86 points, followed by Colorado's Kyle Freeland and Arizona's Patrick Corbin.\n\nVerlander led the AL with 290 strikeouts while going 16-9 with a 2.52 ERA for AL West champion Houston. This is his third second-place finish since winning the Cy Young and MVP in 2011 with Detroit.\n\nKluber was attempting to win his second straight Cy Young and third overall. He went 20-7 with a 2.89 ERA for AL Central champion Cleveland and led the AL with 215 innings.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But after cornerback Josh Norman called out Redskins fans in the aftermath of an ugly victory at Tampa Bay, the spotlight is on the atmosphere at FedEx Field Sunday against the AFC South-leading Houston Texans. (AP Photo/Mark Tenally, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nASHBURN, Va. (AP) \u2014 Home sweet home? Not so much for Redskins players right now.\n\nEven though Washington has won three of five home games this season and leads the NFC East, cornerback Josh Norman called out Redskins fans in the aftermath of an ugly victory at Tampa Bay and said he felt they played better on the road. In the process, he put the spotlight on the atmosphere Sunday at FedEx Field when the AFC South-leading Houston Texans come to town.\n\nNorman said home games are \"like the other team's turf\" because of an infusion of opposing fans and opined that Redskins fans \"just boo everything and aren't really behind us.\" Teammates hope that sentiment works to provide a spark of energy for the rest of the year.\n\n\"We have a really good team and what it comes down to is myself and Josh, we want to be backed up, and we don't want it to feel like it's 50/50 when we're at our home field and they have as many fans as we do,\" running back Chris Thompson said. \"We just want everybody to be there. That's it. We want our fans to be out there and just have our backs.\"\n\nThe Redskins organization began a concerted effort in the offseason to try to improve the fan experience at the stadium in suburban Maryland. Aware a sellout streak the team boasted had lasted the past 50 seasons would end, the decision was made to stop selling as many tickets to brokers and try to draw back in some of the disillusioned fans of a franchise that has just three playoff victories since its last Super Bowl title from the 1991 season.\n\nWashington's average attendance of 61,201 ranks 26th in the NFL, and its 74.6 percent-of-capacity crowd ranks dead last. Chief marketing officer Steve Ziff said prior to the season there's no timeline for when he expects fans to return in droves like the glory days at RFK Stadium.\n\n\"We're going to do things right for as long as it takes,\" Ziff said. \"Every day the goal is to do things right and hopefully over time, win or lose, fans will buy into that.\"\n\nRight now, the Redskins are winning. At 6-3, they're two games up in the division and on pace for their first postseason appearance since 2015.\n\nBut Thompson, who has been with the team since 2013, understands there are long-term issues under the surface leading to fans staying away. Decades of mediocre on-field performance, polarizing opinions about owner Dan Snyder and the location of FedEx Field are all factors that have nothing to do with the current roster and its wins and losses.\n\n\"All the responses I see all the time is, 'We've been fans for 10-plus years, we've been fans for 25 years \u2014 whatever the case may be \u2014 and we haven't gotten any results (and) the Redskins have been terrible,'\" Thompson said. \"I've been here for six years. I understand. I know. I've been to one playoff game in six years.\"\n\nIf the Redskins win the division and host a playoff game, the stands will be rocking like the old days \u2014 especially if Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings are the opponent. But to get there, they could use a boost at home so players don't feel like they're in unfriendly confines.\n\nFor quarterback Alex Smith, it's all about the cadence and ability to communicate verbally.\n\n\"The big thing offensively is communication that you can count on,\" Smith said Wednesday. \"To be at home and be able to communicate, I think you can do more in the huddle and do more at the line of scrimmage.\"\n\nOn defense, it's the opposite. The Redskins are coming off allowing 501 yards but only three points to the Buccaneers, and they're counting on noise against DeShaun Watson and the Texans, who have won six in a row since an 0-3 start.\n\n\"The fans play a big part in the way defenses can play, in the way the atmosphere is out there,\" linebacker Mason Foster said. \"When you get those guys going crazy in the stands, it's hard for quarterbacks to communicate, it's hard for them to audible at the line. When you get that going, I think it's a tough place to play at FedEx.\"\n\nNOTES: Coach Jay Gruden said left tackle Trent Williams (thumb) won't play Sunday and there's a good chance Thompson (ribs) is out, too. ... In addition to Williams and Thompson, WR Jamison Crowder (ankle), CB Quinton Dunbar (shin), S Montae Nicholson (illness) and K Dustin Hopkins (groin) did not practice. Gruden said the team would see how Hopkins is Friday before deciding whether to sign another kicker. ... With Crowder still on the mend, rookie WR Trey Quinn was activated off injured reserve and added to the active roster.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Coach Nagy expects me to play well.\n\n\"I got better from the week before, so I'm embracing that process, just continuously getting better and better.\"\n\nThe Bears (6-3) head into their showdown for first place in the NFC North on Sunday night at Soldier Field against the defending division champion Minnesota Vikings (5-3-1) surprisingly strong on both sides of the football, but still seeing obvious areas to improve.\n\nAnd Matt Nagy would rather they're focused on Minnesota and a game flexed to prime time than awards or other diversions.\n\n\"We talk about poison, the noise, we talk about earmuffs, we talk about horse blinders,\" the coach said. \"You know, don't worry about anything, you just keep playing. If you played a good game great, now next game. And if you played a bad game, now next game, and you just stay straight ahead.\"\n\nTrubisky's career-best 355-yard passing day last Sunday gave the Bears a 34-22 win over the Detroit Lions for their first divisional victory since Halloween 2016.

It's fostering anticipation he'll improve even more.\n\n\"He's slowly improving, which I love,\" Nagy said. \"It's not going to be an overnight thing; he had a good game and we want to continue to have those good games. But there's a process to it.\"\n\nTrubisky made his first start against the Vikings last year in a 20-17 loss, and threw an interception to Harrison Smith in the closing minutes to seal the verdict.\n\n\"I think I've grown a lot since that play,\" Trubisky said. \"I'm not the same player, not even close. I've got better since that instance and I'm excited for the opportunity this weekend.\"\n\nThe Bears won a game over Carolina later in the year when Trubisky completed only four passes.\n\nSo much has changed with the Bears since that point in the fifth game last year, including Nagy's hiring. The trade for pass rusher Khalil Mack and the turnaround under their new coach have led to renewed vitality at Halas Hall. They've become a hot ticket for the television networks, as their home game with the Los Angeles Rams was flexed Wednesday into a Sunday night contest.\n\n\"It's a great vibe around the building now,\" Trubisky said. \"The culture has definitely changed and there's a better vibe around the city in how people view the Bears and how they see us.\"\n\nThe offense is still only 20th at passing but is 10th in touchdown passes with 19. Trubisky's passer rating of 101.6 is higher than those of Cam Newton, Ben Roethlisberger, Deshaun Watson, Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.\n\nYet Nagy sounded a cautionary note earlier this week about the team's running attack.\n\n\"You can't go through this thing and be one-dimensional,\" Nagy said. \"It's just too easy for defenses.\"\n\nJordan Howard hasn't had a 100-yard rushing game this season and the Bears had 64 and 54 yards rushing the last two games, respectively.\n\n\"Keep doing our job and the passing game can keep airing it \u2014 it will open up the run,\" tackle Charles Leno Jr. said. \"We've just got to get (Howard) and (Tarik Cohen) the ball more and those guys will make plays, and we're just going to do a better job.\"\n\nThe other problem area is the kicking game after Cody Parkey nailed the uprights four times on misses in last week's game. So Parkey was slated to practice kicking Wednesday night at Soldier Field because Sunday's game is at night.\n\n\"I mean, it can't hurt,\" Parkey said.\n\nParkey was lampooned on the \"Tonight Show\" by Jimmy Fallon for hitting the uprights. Parkey sounded a bit like Trubisky when asked if he'd heard this.\n\n\"No,\" Parkey said. \"I (couldn't) care less.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 The Detroit Lions have allowed 16 sacks in the past two games \u2014 and this week isn't off to a good start either for the offensive line.\n\nThe Lions put guard T.J. Lang on injured reserve with a neck injury Wednesday. Lang has missed three games this season, including last weekend's loss at Chicago. Detroit signed cornerback Mike Ford to the active roster from the practice squad and signed safety David Jones to the practice squad.\n\n\"He was a good veteran leader,\" center Graham Glasgow said. \"All of us will need to pick up the slack a little bit on that end.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old Lang is in his second season with the Lions after playing eight with Green Bay. Lang signed a three-year deal with Detroit before the 2017 season, returning to his home area. He was born in Royal Oak, went to high school in Bloomfield Hills and went to college at Eastern Michigan.\n\nLang hasn't played a full 16 games since the 2014 season, but he's also never played fewer than 12 in his career.

Lang has also dealt with back, concussion and hip problems this year.\n\nGuard Kenny Wiggins, who signed with the Lions in March, has started the three games that Lang missed so far this season.\n\n\"Same way I always approach it,\" Wiggins said. \"I've been preparing all year like I was a starter. Now it's just how it's going to be now from now on.\"\n\nDetroit (3-6) has lost three straight. The Lions yielded 10 sacks against Minnesota two weekends ago and six against the Bears.\n\n\"It just hasn't been our best performances,\" Glasgow said. \"Part of it has just been the situations that have been, just throughout the game. Down by a few scores, trying to come back and get some points on the board. It's a lot of pass pro, a lot of pass rush.\"\n\nThe Lions have invested a lot in recent years to try to improve their offensive line. Detroit has used four of its past seven first-round draft picks on offensive linemen. Two of those selections \u2014 Taylor Decker and rookie Frank Ragnow \u2014 have started every game for the Lions this season.\n\nLang, however, has been limited, and his future seems uncertain. Detroit's running game has improved a bit, but the sack totals have stood out over the past two weeks. The Lions have fallen behind early, which makes it harder for them to take advantage of their running game.\n\nQuarterback Matthew Stafford has attempted 118 passes over the past three games.\n\n\"We have to do better as a line and as an offensive unit,\" Glasgow said. \"You never plan to pass the ball every play. But, I mean, that's just how it works. The game plan adapts to the situation.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Past digs have found clues near the city, but the most recent excavation uncovered the \"city's urban fabric,\" including floors, walls and door openings, the culture ministry said.\n\nTaking place from September to early October, the excavation found remnants of residences, pottery, coins and tombs, among other discoveries.\n\n\"It is significant that the remnants of the city, the paved roads, the architectural structure, came to light,\" lead archaeologist Elena Korka told CNN. \"We've found evidence of life and death ... and all this is just a small part of the history of the place.\"\n\nMore: Archaeologists opened a mysterious Egyptian sarcophagus.

The city had been believed to survive Rome's invasion of nearby Corinth.\n\nSpecifically, coins discovered in the dig dated to the era of Roman emperor Septimius Severus, who ruled from 193 to 211, indicating economic success, the ministry said.\n\n\"The citizens seem to have been remarkably affluent,\" Korka told the Associated Press.\n\nMore: Oldest weapons discovered in North America tell us more about first Americans, researchers say\n\nMore: Extinct gibbon discovered in an ancient tomb.

(Photo: REED SAXON, AP)\n\nBe sure to keep an eye to the sky this weekend: The peak of the Leonid meteor shower \u2013 an annual mid-November treat \u2013 will be visible across the night sky late Saturday night (Nov. 17) and early Sunday morning (Nov. 18).\n\nThe Leonids appear to be coming from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence their name) in the east, but they should be visible all the way across the sky.\n\nSome of the greatest meteor showers ever seen have been the Leonids. In some years, they've been a full-fledged meteor storm: The 1833 Leonid meteor storm included rates as high as an amazing 100,000 meteors per hour, Earthsky.org said.\n\nNo such storm is forecast this year, though: Viewers should see an hourly rate of some 10 to 15 meteors.\n\nAlso known as \"shooting stars,\" the meteors are actually leftover comet dust. They're tiny pea- and sand-sized bits of dust and debris crumbling off the Tempel-Tuttle comet as it swings by the Earth. (Earth\u2019s orbit takes it straight through the debris trail.)\n\nCLOSE A dash cam caught a meteor streak across the Texas sky on November 15, 2018. USA TODAY\n\nThe dust and debris ignite when it hits our atmosphere.\n\nAs with most meteor showers, the best time to watch the Leonids is usually between the hours of midnight and dawn, according to Earthsky.org. Sky & Telescope agrees, noting that the shower \"should be at its modest best in the three hours between moonset and the beginning of Sunday's dawn.\"\n\nDavid Samuhel, a meteorologist and astronomy blogger at AccuWeather, said people should dedicate at least an hour to viewing the meteor shower. \"Do not look at any light source during that hour like a phone, flashlight, or any type of screen,\" he said.\n\nMore: How to view the Leonid meteor shower peaking this weekend\n\n\"Your eyes will gradually adjust by a half hour, then you will have perfect night vision. You also want to lay as flat as possible so you can see as much of the sky as possible.\u201d\n\nThe keys to good views of the shower are the phase of the moon and the weather.\n\nFirst, there's mixed news about the moon: Although a bright moon will be out for the first part of the night, it will set in the middle of the night.

The two got into an altercation that resulted in the deputy \"going to the ground\" and Cruz grabbing the stun gun out of the deputy's holster. The weapon discharged during the brawl before Beltran regained control, the report says.\n\nCruz continued to swing at the deputy, before Beltran was able to take him into custody, according to video surveillance cited in the report.\n\nCruz appeared at an initial hearing Wednesday on the assault charges, where bail was set at $200,000.\n\nMore: 'Burn, kill, destroy': Parkland school shooter video released\n\nMore: Parkland\u2019s Nikolas Cruz made chilling videos before shooting: \u2018You\u2019re all going to die\u2019\n\nMore: Parkland survivor sends 'thoughts and prayers' to defeated NRA-backed candidates\n\nCruz faces the death penalty in the shooting spree at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.

(Photo: Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Matching signatures. Mailing deadlines. Magic words.\n\nWhile the painstaking tabulation work of Florida's tumultuous recount is starting to wind down across the state, the legal skirmish to determine whether questionable ballots should be counted in the razor-thin and hotly contested U.S. Senate race is just beginning \u2013 and could turn on some key but arcane issues.\n\nUltimately, the courts must decide two questions: whether thousands of disputed ballots should be accepted as part of the count, and what the voter's intent was on the ballots deemed as valid.\n\nMost of the legal challenges have been launched by Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who trails GOP Gov. Rick Scott in the Senate race and is eager to have as many votes added to the mix. Nelson, seeking a fourth term, trails by fewer than 13,000 (or 0.14 percent) out of nearly 8.2 million ballots cast.\n\nIf Republicans were trailing, they'd be pursuing the same tactic, said Charles Zelden, a political science professor and election recount expert at Nova Southeastern University in Florida.\n\n\"There's literally a playbook,\" Zelden said. \"And what it says is, if you are ahead, you want to shut down the voting as quickly as possible, argue deadlines matter, argue that the rules need to be simply followed. (And) if you're behind, you want to extend the voting process, you want to extend the time, and you want to extend the definition of what is and isn't a valid vote.\"\n\nThat's why Nelson and his allies are suing to make sure elections officials have the time to conduct a full recount, that voter signatures on absentee ballots don't have to exactly match the signature on record, and that late-arriving ballots mailed from within the state are counted the same as overseas ballots.\n\nIn addition, Nelson wants to make sure those conducting the recount have the time and latitude to fully divine a voter's intent.\n\nOne state election rule says voters must mark ballots for any and all races in the same manner \u2013 such as circling a name or filling in an oval \u2013 for them to be counted. Another rule allows voters who make a mistake on their ballot to fix the problem by writing so-called \"magic words\" like \"not this\" or \"wrong\" on the ballot. Ballots from voters who cross out names without using magic words aren't counted.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee has told lawyers for the defendant, Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, that they'll have to submit responses to the lawsuit no later than 9 a.m. EST Thursday.\n\nRepublicans have pushed back. Scott charged without evidence that there's \"rampant fraud\" involved in recounts in the Democratic strongholds of Palm Beach and Broward counties. Others have complained about what they view as Democratic efforts to use the legal system to gain an unfair advantage.\n\n\u201cThe recount should happen, and every legal vote should be counted,\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a video statement. \"But what we should not see happen here is that somehow lawyers are able to find federal judges that change Florida election law after the election, go in and basically order the state of Florida to ignore its own laws. You cannot change the rules of the game after the game in order to win, because that would be stealing an election and that would be unacceptable.\u201d\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Scott announced in a tweet that he was recusing himself from his role as a member of Florida's Elections Canvassing Commission, which is scheduled to meet Tuesday to certify results statewide, including the Senate race.\n\nNelson and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on the governor to step back from any role regarding the state's oversight of the election.\n\nI recused myself from certifying results on the Elections Canvassing Commission in 2014, and I will do so again this year. This is nothing new. Bill Nelson is confused and doesn\u2019t even know how Florida works- I have no role in supervising/ overseeing the ongoing recount process. \u2014 Rick Scott (@ScottforFlorida) November 14, 2018\n\nEach of the state's counties are conducting a machine recount of votes in three races \u2013 governor, U.S. Senate and agriculture commissioner. Initial unofficial tallies of those races found the margin between the top two candidates within half a percentage point which, by law, triggers the recount.\n\nThe other two statewide races being retabulated are governor, where Republican Ron DeSantis leads Democrat Andrew Gillum by roughly 33,000 votes (or 0.41 percent), and agriculture commissioner, where Democrat Nikki Fried leads Republican Matt Caldwell by about 5,000 votes (or 0.06 percent).\n\nThe deadline for the recount to be completed is 3 p.m. Thursday.\n\nIf the Senate race remains within 0.25 percent after Thursday, the law triggers a hand recount of ballots that machines could not tally because of how they were filled out.

The star running back has until 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, afternoon to sign his one-year franchise tender and be eligible to play this season. (AP Photo/Don Wright, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 The Pittsburgh Steelers spent the better part of 10 months waiting on Le'Veon Bell to show up for work. They said all the right things, stressed they understood the star running back was making a business decision by opting to stay home in hopes of protecting himself ahead of a potentially lucrative payday next spring.\n\nAnd they'd welcome him with open arms whenever he returned.\n\nOn Wednesday, with Bell's absence for the rest of the season a certainty after he declined to sign his one-year, $14.5-million franchise tender , they exhaled.\n\nAnd pillaged.\n\nBell's teammates invaded his locker after practice, helping themselves to whatever they wanted \u2014 or at least whatever fit \u2014 with Bell's career in Pittsburgh all but over. It wasn't personal. Just business. A celebration of sorts to honor \u2014 they hope anyway \u2014 the last time they'll have to answer questions about Bell's unorthodox approach, one that included leaving his teammates in the dark about his plans.\n\n\"I think we all just assumed he'd be here and it'd be the same as the year before,\" guard David DeCastro said. \"It amazes me in this day and age when you can tweet about things but you can't talk to each other. You're so connected, but you're disconnected at the same time. It's really interesting when you think about it from the big picture side of it. After that it is what it is, you stop worrying about it and you just move on.\"\n\nSomething the first-place Steelers (6-2-1) are more than happy to do. They take a five-game winning streak into Sunday's game at Jacksonville (3-6) looking for a bit of revenge against a team that beat them twice last season at Heinz Field, including a 45-42 stunner in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nBell finished with 157 total yards and two touchdowns in the loss. The Steelers cleaned out their lockers the following day, Bell among them. Despite saying he wanted to be a \"Steeler for life\" he never returned.\n\nBen Roethlisberger attempted to reach out to Bell, texting him before Tuesday's 4 p.m. deadline saying he hoped Bell would come in and sign. Bell never arrived and never responded to the quarterback he played alongside during the first five years of his career.\n\n\"He was a great teammate here, a great football player,\" Roethlisberger said. \"To each his own on what they want to walk away from.\"\n\nThe Steelers, meanwhile, will try to move forward without the versatile Bell, who played a vital role in the team's run of four straight playoff berths. Yet they have hardly missed a beat thanks to the rapid development of second-year back James Conner. The former Pitt star is second in the NFL in yards from scrimmage (1,158 yards) and his 10 rushing touchdowns are already one more than Bell ever put up in a single season.\n\nConner's success, however, also put him in an awkward position. He considers Bell a friend \u2014 and while Bell did otherwise stay silent on Tuesday he did share an Instagram story that appeared to show him promoting Conner to make the Pro Bowl \u2014 and never wanted to be put into an adversarial position against a mentor.\n\n\"I never really pay attention to it,\" James said. \"I always go by the model 'control what you can control,' so I'm just going to keep doing what I've been doing.\"\n\nThose concerns are gone now. While Bell will spend the next four months getting ready to hit free agency in hopes of landing a contract that would make him the highest-paid back in the NFL, Conner's goals are more immediate. He sat out the late portions of a 52-21 romp over Carolina last Thursday after being placed in the concussion protocol for the first time as a pro.\n\nConner admitted he felt \"dizzy\" initially, but was cleared to return to practice on Wednesday and should be fine to face the Jaguars.\n\n\"I feel good, feel like me again,\" Conner said. \"Back to normal.\"\n\nAnd his team again looks like the class of the AFC North. While Bell's absence caused a furor when he didn't come in before the regular season began \u2014 as he did in 2017 \u2014 things have died down considerably over the last month. Going unbeaten since the start of October helps. So does having Conner look like a Pro Bowler in his own right.\n\n\"It's nice that it's over,\" DeCastro said. \"I don't have to give (the media) clich\u00e9s, broken-record answers. We're just going to keep getting James some more yards and keep winning games. At the end of the day it's been fun. We're on a roll and the season goes by a lot faster when you're winning games.\"\n\nNOTES: The NFL flexed San Diego's visit to Pittsburgh on Dec. 2 to 8:20 p.m. EDT.

No Sun,\" is out Friday, marking the band\u2019s first LP in 18 years to include founding members Billy Corgan, James Iha and Jimmy Chamberlin, who are joined by guitarist Jeff Schroeder.\n\nUSA TODAY chats with frontman Billy Corgan about the reunion, fandom and why he\u2019s so active on Instagram.\n\nQuestion: How did conversations start between you, James and Jimmy about getting back together?\n\nBilly Corgan: Honestly, I can't remember. The main thing that happened was James and I started socializing again when I went to Los Angeles. Over a few years of just getting together and making our peace, we eventually broached the subject of working together again. We were doing an acoustic tour as The Smashing Pumpkins, and I invited him on stage in Los Angeles with us, which sort of broke the ice. But it took a long time \u2013 it wasn\u2019t some snap (decision).\n\nQ: What specifically did you guys need to work through in order to move forward?\n\nCorgan: We haven't really discussed it because I don't think it's pertinent to the band. It was more stuff between us that went back 30 years. When you make that kind of peace with a family member, you don't sit down and say, \"Well, you know, in 1992 you hurt my feelings.\" It's really more about mending the fence and letting nature take its course. And that's kind of what happened. We got back in the business of being family again and breaking this 17-plus year wall of not talking.\n\nQ: What exactly went down between you and D'Arcy Wretzky (the band's original bassist, who left the band in 1999)? She recently shared what appear to be text messages between you two, in which you offer to have her be a part of the reunion but only in a limited capacity.\n\nCorgan: The problem is that she presented an incomplete record. Those conversations went on for years. What she presented was, a), without my permission. They were private messages. And b), because I never contextualized the messages, people just filled in their own conspiracy blank and created a narrative that isn't true. As you know, in the world we live in, you can try to correct a narrative that's already sealed in concrete and nobody listens because the narrative that they formed is far more interesting. The reality is quite boring.\n\nQ: Is there any chance you could reconcile or have those bridges been burned?\n\nCorgan: No. I\u2019ve said it repeatedly, but it\u2019s done. Done, done, done.\n\nQ: When you first reunited with the band and producer Rick Rubin, you only intended to record a single track together. How did it turn into a full-blown album?\n\nCorgan: We spent three weeks at The Village (studio) in Los Angeles doing some demos with the idea that we were going to get Rick to do just one song. We presented him eight songs and shockingly, he liked all eight. So we ended up going from recording one song with Rick to (tell fans), \u201cHey, we\u2019re back,\u201d to doing what became this record.\n\nQ: A number of reviews and write-ups about the new music have said you guys are \"recapturing\" and \"harking back to\" your old sound. Did you go back and listen to any past Pumpkins albums while making this?\n\nCorgan: I\u2019m not offended, but it's an offensive question. (Laughs.) I find that really funny, because when you do what you do, somehow it becomes retrospective. For years, I heard people complain that I was being too progressive and that I needed to get back in the room with the people who I made the music with that they liked. So I got back in the room with (those people), and then they (complained) about something else.\n\nIt\u2019s just weird, you can never satisfy something that's a ghost. The ghost of The Smashing Pumpkins is bigger than the reality of Smashing Pumpkins. The Smashing Pumpkins released 180 songs in 10 years, and a lot of songs were electronic, psychedelic, goth. I guarantee you, if we'd done something that was very electronic or goth (this time around), nobody would be talking about, \u201cOh, they\u2019re harking back to their fourth album.\u201d\n\nWe made eight songs in four weeks. That's lightning speed, so there wasn't a lot of thinking, like, \"Hey, let's put on an old album and try to get that guitar sound.\"\n\nQ: Are there any of your hits that you choose not to play live now, in part because they feel like fan service?\n\nCorgan: No. They\u2019re my songs, mostly, and I don\u2019t have a problem with any. It's more conceptual. I've complained for 20-plus years that rock 'n' roll was headed in the wrong direction, and I don't feel I was wrong. Rock 'n' roll was being neutered by the way social media worked and the way fans rose up. You see it now with the way people complain about comic books and \"Star Wars.\" They've created a culture where the fans almost create the ending, not the artists themselves. I'm not interested in being in a band that's servile to the need of a particular fan base. We're quite comfortably poised between who we were, who we are and where we're going.\n\nBilly Corgan greets fans in Anaheim, Calif., in 2016. (Photo: Jesse Grant, Getty Images for NAMM)\n\nQ: You interact a lot with your fans on Instagram. What do you like most about having that line of communication with them?\n\nCorgan: As somebody who's had my avatar stolen by the media and turned into something that I'm not, I quite like reinforcing my brand in line with who I am as a person. Probably the greatest compliment that I get from fans is, \"We like that you do this because it's your own voice. If you\u2019re being a brat, we know it\u2019s you being a brat.\" They don't wonder if it's a media contrivance.\n\nQ: Congratulations on welcoming your daughter, Philomena, last month. How does it feel to have two kids at home (including son Augustus, turning 2 this week)?\n\nCorgan: It\u2019s pretty crazy. I\u2019m almost 52, so having kids late in life has been a pretty wild adventure. I appreciate that I waited because I am really ready to be there for my children and love my children to the best of my ability. But at the same time, I also (understand) why parenting is such a difficult thing for anybody because it requires so much energy and devotion. I\u2019m in awe of any parent who does it well.\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan performing in London last month, as part of the rock band's globe-trotting reunion tour. (Photo: Rob Ball, WireImage)\n\nQ: After the current tour wraps next month, do you plan to take some time off or get right back to work?\n\nCorgan: We're already talking about tour stuff for next year, so there will be more Pumpkins shows in 2019. But for me, once we get off tour, I\u2019m either going to be doing some writing in LA with some friends or going back to Chicago to start writing new Smashing Pumpkins. I also have an inkling to try and get us to do a Christmas record one day, so I might try to use the Christmas spirit to put the record together in concept, even if we're not ready to record it.\n\nQ: Would that include covers or be all original material?\n\nCorgan: It would be a mixture. I have released two Christmas songs, and I was thinking it would be nice to re-record those in the context of the record we would make. It would be probably lean more acoustic. I would think it's a bit weird (to make) wild Christmas records. Although, I also like \"Jingle Bell Rock,\" which is basically 1950s rockabilly. But I don't know. When I think Christmas music, I tend to think something you want to put on and sit around the tree with the kids and not rock out to. I don't see us doing a rocking-out Christmas album.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/14/why-billy-corgan-reunited-original-smashing-pumpkins-new-album/1982257002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Hannah Yasharoff, USA TODAY", "title": "Can Steve Carell, Serious Actor, still be funny?

But first, the slugging in\u2026 [+4957 chars]", "fulltext": "New York Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner speaks to reporters Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/John Amis) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Flush with cash, the New York Yankees may take a run at Manny Machado.\n\nBut first, the slugging infielder would have some explaining to do.\n\nArriving in Atlanta for two days of owners meetings at a hotel next to the Braves' SunTrust Park, Hal Steinbrenner discussed the state of a team that has one of baseball's most dynamic young rosters but came up short in the playoffs the last two seasons.\n\nThe Yankees owner has plenty of money to spend after coming in under the luxury tax threshold last season for the first time since the penalty took effect in 2003. While the top priority is starting pitching, New York is also mentioned as a contender for one of the winter's biggest free-agent prizes.\n\nMachado is a dynamic player but comes with plenty of baggage, including the reputation as a dirty player and his admission that he's \"not the type of player that's going to be Johnny Hustle \" after he jogged out a groundball during the NL Championship Series.\n\n\"Certainly, those comments are troubling,\" Steinbrenner said during a meeting with a small group of reporters in the hotel lobby. He quickly added that it would be the job of general manager Brian Cashman to determine whether the comments would disqualify the Yankees from pursuing such a player.\n\nNew York needs a shortstop for at least the first half of 2019 after Didi Gregorius blew out his throwing elbow in Game 2 of the AL Division series , leading to Tommy John reconstructive surgery.\n\n\"If we're interested in any player, we sit down with them face to face with their agent and ask them, 'Where did this come from? What context was around the entire interview? What point were you trying to make? How do you justify it?'\" Steinbrenner said. \"Because that ain't going to sell where we play baseball.\"\n\nSteinbrenner also insisted many players with troubling reputations do just fine in New York.\n\n\"We have a great clubhouse,\" the owner said. \"They just don't put up with a lot of nonsense from players, whether it's a rookie just coming up or new players \u2014 even if they're veterans \u2014 coming in. That's a problem I'm less worried about. But makeup is a big part of what we look at. It's not just analytics.\"\n\nMachado doesn't seem to be a priority. Mimicking Cashman's recent comments at the general manager meetings in California , Steinbrenner said the shaky starting pitching must be addressed.\n\nIn a 3-1 loss to the Red Sox in the ALDS , Masahiro Tanaka was the only starter to last five innings. J.A. Happ, Luis Severino and CC Sabathia each took a loss after combining to give up 14 earned runs in eight innings, an ERA of 15.75.\n\n\"We have to add pieces,\" Steinbrenner said. \"Our starting pitching struggled in October. That was obvious. Tanaka was the only one who had good start in the Division Series, so we've got work to do.\"\n\nSteinbrenner didn't rule out another huge contract. The Yankees already have Giancarlo Stanton , who is guaranteed $270 million over the next decade unless he opts out of the deal following the 2020 season. Machado is likely to seek an even bigger deal.\n\n\"Who is the person? How old are they? What are their abilities? What is their injury history? Do we really need that particular position?\" Steinbrenner said, describing how he would approach another megadeal. \"I'm not against looking. We will leave no stone unturned.\"\n\nIn the end, the mantra is simple.\n\nWorld Series or Bust \u2014 especially after the rival Red Sox claimed the World Series championship.\n\n\"Look, our goal is to win the world championship, so it's going to hurt me no matter who it is,\" he said. \"But clearly, having our biggest rival do it hurts more. Absolutely.\"\n\nOn other subjects:\n\n\u2014 Steinbrenner said he's hopeful his late father will be selected for the Hall of Fame. George Steinbrenner is among 10 candidates on the Today's Game Era ballot , which will surely set up plenty of debate over whether seven World Series titles and 11 AL pennants are enough to offset two lengthy suspensions from the game. \"I feel he deserves to be in, and a lot of other people do too,\" Hal Steinbrenner said. \"I think it's just a matter of time.\"\n\n\u2014 The Yankees owner declined to comment on his team's plans to buy back the 80 percent stake in the YES Network sold to 21st Century Fox from 2012-14. Steinbrenner did indicate new investors likely would own a majority stake in the network, while the team retained control over content and presentation. It had a similar arrangement with Fox.\n\n\"Our ownership would be in all likelihood in the same ballpark,\" he said. \"But more important than how many points of equity we own, it's the ability to maintain control of the broadcast, the content, everything we always had, everything Fox was great at accepting.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

The best situations are where we completely drop a team out of this article, only for them to make a last minute run. This isn\u2019t any form of power rankings. It\u2019s simply an update on where teams stand in regards to making the playoff race. We\u2019ll discuss chances at the division and also what teams are most likely to grab a wild-card berth.\n\nAFC East\n\nIs it too early to call this division over? It\u2019s never too early to call this division over. It\u2019s essentially over.\n\nNew England Patriots (7-3)\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Jets, Vikings, @ Dolphins, @ Steelers, Bills, Jets\n\nEveryone is burying the Patriots because they lost to the best scoring defense in the NFL at their field, in a big game for the Titans. Why does everyone do this to themselves? The Patriots have 3 wins left on their schedule and maybe it\u2019s four \u2014 by sweeping the division. Beat the Steelers and it\u2019s 12 wins and a bye.\n\nTom Brady was 21 of 41 for 254 yards. He had no interceptions. He is somehow losing his fastball, but that\u2019s not a bad game. People just fawned over Eli Manning throw for 180 yards against a bad Niners defense.\n\nThis is neither here nor there. The real point is the Patriots are playing for a bye still. Let\u2019s not bury them just yet.\n\nMiami Dolphins (5-5):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Colts, Bills, Patriots, @ Vikings, Jaguars, @ Bills\n\nIt just feels like the Dolphins are a .500 team. They win the games they are supposed to win. They lose the games they are supposed to lose. With their remaining games that could be 9-7. It could be 8-8 since the Colts are playing well and the Dolphins have to travel to Indy to play that game.\n\nIs Ryan Tannehill going to come back? We don\u2019t know. He probably will be rusty after missing a large portion of the season. It\u2019s also not great when the starting quarterback is having shoulder issues. Shoulders are apparently very important when throwing to receivers. The Dolphins aren\u2019t catching the Patriots unless New England absolutely implodes. They need to monitor the final wild-card spot.\n\nAFC North\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (6-2-1):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Jaguars, @ Broncos, Chargers, @ Raiders, Patriots, @ Saints, Bengals\n\nThe Steelers now know they won\u2019t have Le\u2019Veon Bell at all this season. That\u2019s fine since James Conner has been pretty darn good anyway. This version of the Steelers team \u2014 not the version that started the season \u2014 should beat the Jaguars and Broncos even though both games are away.\n\nThen the Steelers enter an absolutely brutal stretch of their schedule. The Chargers are good and could be the second best team in the AFC. There are rumors Hunter Henry may even come back. The Raiders are going to be a cakewalk but then the Steelers end their season against rival New England and at New Orleans. Pittsburgh wants a bye \u2014 it would be a lot easier to beat the Patriots at Heinz Field \u2014 but they have to play mistake-free football to do so.\n\nCincinnati Bengals (5-4):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Ravens, Browns, Broncos, @ Chargers, Raiders, @ Browns, @ Steelers\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at me . . . the person who predicted the Bengals would actually win the AFC North. The best picture is probably inserting the \u201cNot great, Bob!\u201d GIF. Picture it though. That\u2019s what I look like.\n\nThe Bengals defense has been hot garbage most of the season. The reason I picked them to win the AFC North was that their defense was good enough combined with their offense to build a well-rounded team. Bad choice by me.\n\nThe Bengals should win their next three games \u2014 assuming Robert Griffin or Lamar Jackson start for the Ravens \u2014 and there is only one really difficult game remaining on their schedule. That might be a home game if Cincinnati fans travel to Los Angeles. So there is a chance, if Pittsburgh slips up, that the Bengals could host a playoff game. Let\u2019s be serious though, it is the Bengals.\n\nAFC West\n\nThis division comes down to two teams, and both should make the playoffs based off their talent.\n\nKansas City Chiefs (9-1):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Rams, @ Raiders, Ravens, Chargers, @ Seahawks, Raiders\n\nKansas City has the best record in the AFC and they get to the play the Raiders two more times. What a blessing! The Chiefs control their own destiny now that the Patriots lost to the Titans. They have a two-game lead on the Patriots. They have a 1.5 game lead on the Steelers. They have a one-game lead on the Chargers \u2014 with a head to head win to start the season.\n\nThere is no excuse for the Chiefs to not get the one seed. Even if they lose to the Rams this Monday Night \u2014 in a game that was supposed to be played in Mexico but is now at the Coliseum \u2014 they still have an easy run. Andy Reid always had the excuse that his teams had to travel in the playoffs. They most likely won\u2019t have to do so. It\u2019s time to make the Super Bowl or it\u2019s a disappointment.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (7-2):\n\nRemaining Schedule: Broncos, Cardinals, @ Steelers, Bengals, @ Chiefs, Ravens, @ Broncos\n\nSo there\u2019s a win against Denver and a win against Arizona. The Steelers game could be difficult but maybe Joey Bosa and Hunter Henry are suddenly back \u2014 Bosa is probably more likely. Let\u2019s just say the Chargers run off with four wins. They have the running game, quarterback, receiving talent, and defense to do so \u2014 really the only thing they lack is a kicker.\n\nThe Chargers could potentially be playing the Chiefs, in Kansas City, with a chance to win the AFC West, and a chance at the top seed in the AFC. Home field advantage doesn\u2019t matter much to the Chargers, but it would be nice.\n\nEven if that doesn\u2019t happen, the Chargers only need to beat the teams they should beat to make the playoffs.\n\nAFC South\n\nHouston Texans (6-3):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Redskins, Titans, Browns, Colts, @ Jets, @ Eagles, Jaguars\n\nThe Texans come off the bye the same place they were when they entered the bye: in first place of the AFC South. Their biggest game will be against the Titans in Houston. Take the under there. That game involves two amazing defenses.\n\nAs for the rest of their schedule, they shouldn\u2019t be too nervous. The Eagles may have nothing to play for by the time that game rolls around. The Browns are improving but are beatable. The Texans should beat the Colts in Houston. The Jets are a joke after being kind of frisky earlier on in the year. In fact, the Texans could be a sneaky bye team. All they need is a Patriots loss \u2014 although the Pats do have the tiebreaker against Houston \u2014 and a Pittsburgh slip up.\n\nTennessee Titans (5-4):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Colts, @ Texans, Jets, Jaguars, @ Giants, Redskins, Colts\n\nThis is what I said about the Titans last week:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance the Titans aren\u2019t on this list come next week. If they upset the Patriots then we know they truly belong. If they get blown out, they are one of those teams that aren\u2019t making the playoffs.\u201d\n\nThey won. Now they need to prove they can win a big game away from the confines of their own homes. They need to not play down to the level of their opponent. They show up in big games. Now show up in games that aren\u2019t exactly marquee. The Titans have two huge games against division opponents. They almost need to win both.\n\nOutside and Frisky\n\nBaltimore Ravens (4-5): The Ravens had a bye and dropped off the list. This is what happens when RG3 or Lamar Jackson is scheduled to start.\n\nIndianapolis Colts (4-5): The Colts are fun. They probably aren\u2019t a playoff team, but they are definitely fun again."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Cardinals sign 2 cornerbacks, guard Justin Pugh goes on IR", "description": "The Arizona Cardinals have signed cornerbacks David Amerson and Leonard Johnson", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/14/cardinals-sign-2-cornerbacks-guard-justin-pugh-goes-on-ir/38529875/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:01:41Z", "content": "TEMPE, Ariz.

One thing is for sure, LSU's ranking is head scratching. USA TODAY\n\nDavidson is putting up big numbers with its triple option offense. (Photo: Jeff Golden, Getty Images)\n\nCorrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story incorrectly named Davidson College and Washington & Lee University.\n\nDavidson College already boasts sports fame as a basketball school and NBA star Stephen Curry\u2019s alma mater.\n\nBut the North Carolina school is drawing national attention on the football field this fall because of an explosive option offense that shattered an Football Championship Subdivision record last Saturday with 789 yards rushing in a 56-52 loss to San Diego\n\nThe previous standard - 681 yards, set by Missouri State - had stood for 30 years.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t look like a traditional option team,\u201d Davidson coach Scott Abell told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cWe are not grinding out the clock and worrying about time of possession.\u201d\n\nFar from it.\n\nIn Abell\u2019s first season at Davidson, the team is averaging 440.2 rushing yards and 45.3 points per game. Seven different Davidson players have rushed for more than 100 yards in a game and last Saturday, four players rushed for 150 yards or more, led by Wesley Dugger with 231 yards. The Wildcats broke off three touchdown runs of 80 or more yards.\n\nThis season, the Wildcats have rushed for 20 or more yards on a play 39 times.\n\nWhat makes Davidson\u2019s offense unique is the Wildcats run five different versions of the triple option, all of them operating out of a shotgun formation.\n\n\u201cWe want to score points and we want to be an exciting offense to watch,\u201d Abell said. \u201cKids love that. We are involving a lot of athletes in different roles in this offense. Will Wicks had 199 yards rushing last Saturday and last year he was their No. 1 receiver. Now he\u2019s playing in the slot for us. He\u2019s still one of our better receivers when we throw the football, but he\u2019s also involved in our run game.\"\n\nDavidson sometimes plays a hurry-up game, which is not traditional for an option attack. Davidson also uses a wide range of formations, also not typical of an option offense.\n\n\u201cAnd we are more committed to throwing the football more than the average option team,\u201d Abell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already thrown for more than 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns this season.\u201d\n\nMore: What College Football Playoff committee got right, wrong in third rankings\n\nMore: New approach has West Virginia in range of College Football Playoff\n\nMore: How two recusals on Playoff committee could impact Oklahoma's case\n\nSophomore quarterback Tyler Phelps was recruited by the previous regime, but he has adapted to the many reads he has had to make as an option quarterback.\n\n\u201cThe ability to hurt people with his feet and his arm is really important for us,\u201d Abell said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want a running back back there playing quarterback. We want a quarterback.\u201d\n\nAbell describes Phelps as a leader \u201cwho cares about all the things he needs to care about.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s record is 5-5 this season, but that represents a significant improvement for a program that was 7-49 with only one Pioneer conference win in five seasons before Abell was hired away from Washington and Lee University. Abell ran the same offense at Division III Washington & Lee and led the nation in rushing three out of six seasons.\n\nIf the Wildcats beat Butler Saturday, they would have the school\u2019s first winning football record since 2007.\n\n\u201cIt has taken off quicker than I would have ever guessed,\u201d Abell said. \u201cWhen you implement new schemes, offensive and defensively, you know there\u2019s going to be a learning curve. We\u2019ve had those. But credit to our assistant coaches and players to how quickly they have grasped these concepts. They are really executing the offense at a very high level.\u201d\n\nThe Wildcats rushed for 571 yards in the first half against Conference-leading San Diego and they scored 91 points in a win against Guilford earlier this season.\n\n\u201cWe know are moving in the right direction, but we find ourselves shaking our heads because we could really be 9-1,\u201d Abell said. \u201cWe lost four games where we had the lead in the fourth quarter. But we knew in this first year that wins would be hard to come by.\""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Video shows alleged El Chapo drug tunnel", "description": "Prosecutors have started presenting evidence to jurors in the trial of the notorious drug smuggler known as El Chapo by giving them a video tour of a tunnel between Mexico and an Arizona warehouse.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump on Wednesday backed a criminal justice reform plan being pushed by one of his top advisers, son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe \"First Step Act,\" developed by Kushner and a bipartisan group of lawmakers, is designed to improve rehabilitation programs for former prisoners and give judges more discretion in sentencing offenders for nonviolent crime, particularly drug offenders.\n\nTrump said the legislation would \"make our communities safer and give former inmates a second chance at life after they have served their time.\"\n\nProponents have sought changes for years, arguing that mandatory sentencing, including for repeat offenders, has led to excessively long imprisonment for relatively minor crimes. And they note those sentences tend to disproportionately fall on African-Americans.\n\nSupporters said they hoped the president's support could speed the legislation's approval, possibly before the new Congress is seated in January. Others were skeptical lawmakers would move that fast.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., released a joint statement praising Trump's endorsement and said it would allow the proposal's sponsors to \"quickly take a critical first step towards reforming our criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nThe legislation also would place federal prisoners closer to home, allow more home confinement for lower-level offenders and expand prison employment programs.\n\nTrump announced his support at a White House event where he was flanked by lawmakers and joined by Kushner, who has made criminal justice reform a centerpiece of his portfolio. Members of both parties have long predicted criminal justice reform had the potential to win bipartisan support, but it has taken years for the legislation to materialize.\n\n\"Did I hear that word 'bipartisan'? Did I hear that word? That's a nice word,\" Trump said.\n\nBut Trump also used the event to take a shot at President Bill Clinton, who signed a sweeping crime bill in 1994 that funded community police officers and drug courts but also mandated sentences for certain crimes. Trump described the latest effort as rolling back parts of the \"Clinton crime law.\"\n\nOpinion: Governors: We need bipartisan criminal justice reform to improve lives and our workforce\n\nRelated: California Gov. Brown signs sweeping bail reform bill\n\nSome House and Senate Democrats who have been players on criminal justice reform said they have serious concerns about the Senate proposal, including whether it goes far enough to address mass incarceration and racial profiling.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., who has led criminal justice reform efforts, called for the Congressional Budget Office to study those concerns.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency around here to introduce a bill with a title, discuss the title and then go to the press conference,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said he doubted Congress would act before next year. He said he expected more action in the next session and noted that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who said he is likely to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed interest in the issue.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s leadership that could bring about some change,\" Cardin said. \"We need to do it. We\u2019re losing too many of our people. It\u2019s ridiculous.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the House passed a version of the bill sponsored by Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., and Rep. Hakeem Jefferies, D-N.Y., which Trump also backed. Critics, including some Democrats, said that bill didn\u2019t address the controversial issue of mandatory minimum sentencing.\n\nAdvocacy groups supporting criminal justice reforms praised the Senate compromise, saying it\u2019s long overdue.\n\n\"At a time when our nation feels more divided than ever, one thing nearly all Americans agree on is the need to fix our broken criminal justice system,\" Holly Harris, executive director of the Justice Action Network, a coalition of groups, said in a statement.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/14/donald-trump-embraces-criminal-justice-reform-package-congress/2000991002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Stephen Curry to miss 3 Texas games while nursing injury", "description": "Stephen Curry won't play during Golden State's three-game Texas road trip as he recovers from a left groin strain, though he is traveling with the Warriors", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/11/14/stephen-curry-to-miss-3-texas-games-while-nursing-injury/38529817/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:50:07Z", "content": "OAKLAND, Calif.

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Chris Coons, D-Del., urged brisk debate on the legislation in an effort to prevent President Donald Trump from firing Mueller. Trump has called the probe a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nFlake asked for unanimous consent to bring up the bill for a vote because he argued that Trump sought to sow doubt about and curtail Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"With the firing of the attorney general and, in my view, the improper installation of an acting attorney general, who has not been subject to confirmation by this body, the president now has this investigation in his sights, and we all know it,\" Flake said.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., objected to the request, so it was rejected.\n\nMcConnell had told reporters earlier Wednesday that there was no need for the legislation because the probe is in \"no danger\" and Trump hasn't proposed to end it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any legislation is necessary,\" McConnell said. \u201cWe know how the president feels about the Mueller investigation, but he\u2019s never said he wants to shut it down.\u201d\n\nFlake said he would oppose consideration of dozens of Trump's judicial nominees until the bill gets a vote.\n\nThe bill gained urgency Nov. 7, when Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from overseeing Mueller. Trump named Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, as acting attorney general.\n\nWhitaker's appointment drew fire because he sharply criticized the investigation and suggested it could be defunded before he joined the Justice Department a year ago.\n\nTwo Republican former U.S. attorneys general \u2013 Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales \u2013 questioned the propriety of the appointment because Whitaker hadn't been serving in a Senate-confirmed position.\n\nBut the department's Office of Legal Counsel released a 20-page opinion Wednesday that said Whitaker is \"unquestionably\" authorized to take the post because he had served in a top job for more than a year.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill in April, 14 to 7. The bill would:\n\ncodify Justice Department regulations to ensure a special counsel can be fired only for good cause by a Senate-confirmed official of the department, with the reason provided in writing,\n\nprovide the special counsel a 10-day window to seek expedited judicial review of his removal, and\n\npreserve staffing, documents and other materials of the investigation while the firing is debated.\n\nCoons said on MSNBC Tuesday that \"Whitaker strikes me as a clear and present danger to the independence of the special counsel.\"\n\nSen.

Coach Anthony Lynn said he was excited to see Bosa practicing with his teammates for the first time since Sept. 5.\n\nBosa did individual drills during the portion of practice open to reporters and was listed as limited on the team's practice report. Lynn has continued to stress caution about when Bosa could return, but acknowledged he could play against Denver depending on how well the third-year lineman does in individual and team drills.\n\n\"He hasn't played football in 13-14 weeks, whatever it is. So we have to be careful putting him back in,\" Lynn said.\n\nBosa first injured his foot during training camp, which caused him to miss the preseason. He reinjured it during practice leading up to the opener against Kansas City. Bosa said two weeks ago that he should not have rushed in trying to get back for the first week.\n\nIsaac Rochell, who started three games at defensive end, said Bosa has been a big presence in team meetings even though he hasn't played.\n\n\"He's super engaged. He's been locked in at all times. He has been going through scouting reports and the game plan,\" Rochell said.\n\nThe Chargers are 7-2 and have won six straight despite Bosa's absence. Los Angeles' pass rush struggled early in the season, but has 15 sacks in the past four games. Bosa has 23 sacks in two seasons, including an NFL-record 19 in his first 20 games.\n\nBosa's return this week could help bolster a unit that is down two starters at linebacker after Denzel Perryman was placed on injured reserve due to a knee injury. Denver is 3-6 but is ranked 11th in the league in offense.\n\n\"It has been tough seeing him go through the rehab and everything,\" Rochell said about Bosa. \"With him coming back, I think it will add a lot. We're excited.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Christian Palma) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 The NFL's decision to move the regular-season game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Rams due to the poor condition of the turf at Azteca Stadium has left many Mexicans disappointed, angered and wondering how it will affect the relationship with the league for the future.\n\nAfter consulting with the players association and local officials, the NFL determined the conditions of the historic venue did not meet the standards for playability and moved the game back to the Los Angeles Coliseum. The Rams (9-1) and the Chiefs (9-1) will face off Monday night in a much-anticipated game between the top two teams in each conference.\n\nBased solely on the teams' records, the game was going to be the best matchup ever played outside the United States.\n\nBut Mexico blew it.\n\n\"Colossal shame\" was the headline of the sports newspaper Record. \"The league takes away the best game of the season due to the lousy state of the field that Estadio Azteca was not able to fix. The NFL has left, and its return is in jeopardy.\"\n\nAzteca officials changed the playing surface from natural grass to a hybrid in May, but the turf hasn't been ideal for several months due to its intense use. Since July 21, America and Cruz Azul, the two Liga MX teams that share the stadium, have played 23 games between them in the stadium, and the women's professional team from America has played another seven games there.\n\nThe stadium also hosted two concerts by Colombian singer Shakira on Oct. 11 and 12, and another one from music channel Telehit on Nov. 7 that left the field in its worst condition in years.\n\n\"I feel devastated, angered and ashamed, all of that together,\" said former NFL kicker Raul Allegre, who is Mexican and works as an analyst for ESPN Deportes. \"I'm still trying to figure out how small minds were so irresponsible in the preparations for a game of this magnitude. I know that the world does not revolve around the NFL, but this is a great event not only for the sport but for the country, and it is inconceivable how it was taken so lightly.\"\n\nAccording to an NFL study released last year, the game between the Oakland Raiders and the Houston Texans played in 2016 generated a $45 million impact on the local economy. The Mexican government said that last year*s game between the Raiders and the New England Patriots topped that number.\n\n\"Our fans in Mexico are among the most passionate, dedicated NFL fans anywhere in the world,\" said Mark Waller, the league's executive vice president of International who will be in Mexico City on Thursday to discuss next year and what needs to occur at Azteca to keep the NFL interested in playing there. \"We will continue to look for ways to bring them closer to the NFL in the days and weeks ahead. We share the disappointment of not being able to play this game as planned in Mexico City.\"\n\nThe game is usually scheduled on the third weekend of November, when Mexicans celebrate the Revolution*s anniversary, and the authorities organize additional activities in order to entice fans to spend the whole weekend in the capital. For this year's game, the fanfest that drew more than 300,000 fans in Chapultepec Park was moved to the Zocalo, the country's main square located in downtown Mexico City, in an attempt to draw even more fans. The NFL office in Mexico and the Sports Institute of Mexico City also scheduled a 5k and 10k race for Sunday.\n\nLocal authorities have not said whether both events will continue.\n\n\"We have to learn from this experience so it won't happen again in the future\", said Horacio De la Vega, director of the sports institute in Mexico City. \"Everyone needs to assume their own responsibility in this. I think that the crew that takes care of the field in Azteca should have put more attention in such a big issue as the playing field is, and that did not happen.\"\n\nMany fans are also angered because they already paid airfares and hotel fees that are probably lost.\n\n\"I'm very upset because I already purchased my plane tickets and they canceled the game at the last minute. They promised to reimburse my money for the game ticket, but what about the other expenses, who is going to be held accountable for that?\" said Victor Reynoso, a Rams fan who was planning to come to the capital from the northern city of Monterrey.\n\nReynoso is probably not alone, according to Mexico's Tourism Secretary; around 30,000 fans come to the city for the weekend of the game.\n\nThe federal government, through the Tourism Secretary, pays the NFL $14.5 million for each game. Last year, the NFL and Televisa, which owns Estadio Azteca, announced that they signed an extension to bring back games until the 2021 season.\n\nBut it's uncertain what is going to happen after Televisa failed to present a field up to the standards for an NFL game. Several NFL owners are wary of further games at Azteca because of this situation, and the league is still keen on playing games in Mexico, but might be ready to consider other venues there. Monterrey and Guadalajara have stadiums capable of hosting NFL games, and both cities will be hosting games in the 2026 World Cup, though the NFL has believed Azteca is the best option.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Barry Wilner contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDoes anyone really want to host the Winter Olympics? Residents in Calgary answered that question with a resounding \"No,\" and now the International Olympic Committee has some soul-searching to do. Again.\n\nAfter being rejected in yet another public vote, the IOC is down to two candidates to host the 2026 Games \u2014 Stockholm, Sweden, and a joint Italian bid from Milan and Cortina D'Ampezzo. Both of those bidders also have issues , and organizers are scrambling to hand the next available Winter Games to one of them before either bid gets derailed. They will award the Games next June.\n\nIf either of those candidates work out, it will be a victory in that Sweden or Italy will break a string of three straight Winter Games in Asia, two of which \u2014 Sochi (2014) and Beijing (2022) \u2014 have been run by authoritarian governments that didn't have to answer to the public for the money they spent to host.\n\nBut that's not to say Western democracies are falling back in love with the movement. Despite the IOC's attempts to streamline the bidding process and control the costs of the Games, no fewer than eight Western cities and countries have rejected the idea \u2014 either through elections or government action \u2014 of bankrolling what is increasingly viewed as a bloated, expensive sports festival with little upside for the city that takes them on.\n\n\"I think Calgary is another example of a democracy, more specifically, voters in a democracy, deciding that the hosting of the Olympic Games is just not in their best interest \u2014 and they have other things to focus on,\" said Chris Dempsey, who spearheaded Boston's opposition to hosting the 2024 Games.\n\nHere's a look at some of people, places and things in the bidding game, and where they stand after Tuesday's vote:\n\nITALY \u2014 The nation's federal government has vowed not to pay a penny after Turin was removed from this multi-city bid. It means regional governments will foot the brunt of the bill. Rome has bailed on two previous bids for the Summer Games, most recently in 2024, which certainly isn't a comforting thought for the IOC.\n\nSTOCKHOLM \u2014 Only three days after the IOC put the Swedish capital on its short list of finalists, a newly formed government in the city announced it would not provide funding to host the Games. Negotiations are ongoing.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 They have kept venues intact and, in many cases, improved on them, and there is no significant public opposition. To sum it up, the 2002 hosts could probably hold another Olympics in a few months , if pressed. IOC President Thomas Bach would be wise to award them 2030 right now \u2014 that is, only if they don't want 2026.\n\nDENVER \u2014 The only city to be awarded the Olympics, for 1976, only to turn around and reject them, is officially in the running to be the U.S. candidate for 2030. But it's not much of a contest. Not helping matters: Colorado's incoming governor, Jared Polis, recently channeled his inner Richard Lamm \u2014 the then-governor-to-be who led the opposition in the 1970s \u2014 calling the Olympics \"fun things for millionaires and business people\" that leave others paying the bill.\n\nTHOMAS BACH \u2014 The president of the IOC looks more brilliant by the day for his decision to award two Summer Games \u2014 2024 to Paris and 2028 to Los Angeles \u2014 in one shot at last year's IOC meeting. Acknowledging there were \"too many losers\" in the bidding game, he took the only two suitors he had left for the more-expensive, more-grandiose Summer Games and gave them both a victory. He might consider a two-for-one approach on the Winter side, as well.\n\nCASEY WASSERMAN \u2014 Bach might be the president, but it would be difficult to find someone who wields more power in the movement than the head of the LA 2028 organizing committee. He's had a major role in shaping the new U.S. Olympic Committee, signing off on the hiring of the new CEO and CFO. Because he agreed to take the consolation prize, 2028, in what began as a contest for the 2024 Summer Games, he brokered an advantageous marketing deal with the USOC. And his blessing \u2014 and only his blessing \u2014 would be crucial to pushing Salt Lake City into the 2026 slot \u2014 a move that is currently untenable because of how it would impact the LA marketing arrangement.\n\nROTATING CITIES \u2014 The fantastical notion of rotating Olympics between three or four cities \u2014 say Sydney, London and Beijing on the Summer side, and Salt Lake City, Sochi and Vancouver on the Winter side \u2014 suddenly doesn't seem so outlandish. Given the current trend, there's no guaranteeing any city will want to host this behemoth past 2030. Dempsey, the Olympic skeptic, concedes the Olympics provide plenty of magic and power, \"but that magic and power would be just as strong if there were one Winter and one Summer location for the Olympics, or some other process that allows you to host the Games without making exorbitant promises that lead to exorbitant costs.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Gonzalez, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Clay Helton believes his job at Southern California is secure as he heads into two games that could determine whether he's right.\n\nThe coach addressed the pertinent topic of his future with the Trojans in a meeting this week, and he did it again when asked about it Tuesday night after practice. While he recognizes the fan unrest created by USC's 5-5 season, Helton told his players to focus on their upcoming rivalry games against UCLA and Notre Dame, not on whether he is about to make a sudden departure.\n\n\"I feel very secure in where I'm at,\" Helton said. \"Like I told them, my plan is to be here for another 15 years. I'd like to do it 'til I'm 60, right here. That's my plan. Know this, I'm not going anywhere. I want them to know my jaw is set.\"\n\nHelton is one season removed from leading USC to the Pac-12 title, and two seasons removed from winning the Rose Bowl in his first full year in charge of a program that he has twice rescued from turmoil. He is 32-15 as the Trojans' head coach, and his contract runs through 2023.\n\nBut the Trojans (5-5, 4-4 Pac-12) are out of the Pac-12 South race heading into their 88th crosstown showdown with the rebuilding Bruins (2-8, 2-5). After three defeats in their last four games, including an embarrassing performance by Helton's offense last weekend in a 15-14 loss to California, their bowl prospects are uncertain even with a sixth win.\n\nA sixth regular-season loss would be the most by a USC team since 2000 \u2014 the year before Pete Carroll took over. Helton has been coaching long enough to know there's a price to pay for such a season at a program with USC's expectations, but he doesn't expect it to be his job.\n\n\"I have a lot of support from (athletic director) Lynn Swann,\" Helton said. \"Lynn, every Monday, walks into my office and has given me nothing but, 'Coach, we're in this for the long haul.' We're going to get this done. That's what I've felt from Day One, and what I felt after the Cal game also. I know, in my heart, I'm going to be here. ... The only pressure I feel is to help a bunch of seniors and a bunch of kids go out and get the Victory Bell one more year.\"\n\nSwann gave a hefty contract extension to Helton last winter even though he didn't hire the coach, and he has remained publicly behind Helton.\n\nHelton's players also stood behind Helton after practice. They know the sky-high expectations placed on every USC team by its fans, and they say they're to blame for not reaching them.\n\n\"Coach Helton is worried about the ballgame,\" freshman quarterback J.T. Daniels said. \"He's not worried about what some random dude in his pajamas is saying on Twitter. ... Nobody listens to Twitter. There's no requirement to have a Twitter account. Anybody can tweet what they want at any time. It's on us as players to realize just because a lot of people are saying it, doesn't make it true.\"\n\nHelton said he addressed his job status with his team because he knows social media chatter can get in the players' heads. Helton has never been a popular hire with a vocal online segment of the USC fan base despite his stabilizing influence on the program and two seasons of immediate success with Sam Darnold as his starting quarterback.\n\nA big finish to the regular season would relieve much of the pressure, and the Trojans would love to give it to Helton.\n\n\"I don't think there is a situation,\" receiver Michael Pittman Jr. said. \"I feel like Coach Helton has become a better head coach this season. It may not seem like it to people outside, but I feel like he's taken steps. He's doing the right thing. It may not be the prettiest ... (but) he's coaching us hard, and I couldn't be more proud of the changes he's made. People see it as he's ruining the team, but he's actually making it better. It's just we're in construction years right now.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: www.apnews.com/CollegeFootball and www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Dermer, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The Indians traded one of their extra pieces. They're keeping their bigger ones \u2014 for now.\n\nCleveland began what could be a busy offseason on Wednesday by dealing versatile infielder Erik Gonzalez to the Pittsburgh Pirates as part of a five-player swap.\n\nThe AL Central champions sent the 27-year-old Gonzalez, who appeared in 81 games for the Indians last season, along with minor league right-handers Tahnaj Thomas and Dante Mendoza to the Pirates for outfielder Jordan Luplow and infielder Max Moroff.\n\nGonzalez batted .265 with one homer and 16 RBIs last season for Cleveland, which signed the Dominican native in 2009. And while he filled a valuable utility role, he was not going to crack the starting lineup behind All-Stars Francisco Lindor and Jose Ramirez.\n\n\"That was a tough thing for us,\" Indians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said. \"We've had multiple conversations with Erik about it. He's done so many things to impact the organization in his time with us, from the time he signed. He's played every position on the field I think other than catcher at one point or another. But, as our roster has taken shape over the course of the past few seasons, we have not had an opportunity for him to play regularly.\n\n\"So, we feel this will give Erik an opportunity to play more with Pittsburgh and continue his career and potentially blossom into the everyday player we think he can be.\"\n\nThe negligible move gives the Indians needed depth in the outfield, and it could be the first of many deals this winter.\n\nCleveland has not dismissed speculation it may be willing to trade prominent players, including ace Corey Kluber and right-hander Carlos Carrasco. Antonetti said it's difficult to measure whether the team has seen an increase in teams wanting to do business with the Indians.\n\n\"I think what I would reiterate is that I think the conversations have reaffirmed for us that we have a lot of players on our roster and throughout our organization that are of interest to other teams,\" he said. \"And I think what that allows us to do is have a lot of dialogue with other teams about potential opportunities for us to move forward as an organization and get better.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old Luplow is one of those opportunities. Cleveland's outfield was decimated by injuries last season, and the team is not expected to re-sign Michael Brantley as a free agent.\n\nLuplow appeared in 64 games over the past two seasons with the Pirates, who named him their top minor league player in 2017.\n\n\"He's capable of playing all three outfield spots,\" Antonetti said. \"He's spent most of the time in left and right, but we also believe he has the ability to play center field. He complements our roster really well as a right-handed-hitting outfielder that we think is capable of helping us at the major league level.\"\n\nMoroff has split the last three seasons between Triple-A Indianapolis and Pittsburgh, appearing in 26 games for the Pirates in 2018.\n\nAntonetti dealing young players \u2014 especially pitchers \u2014 like Thomas and Mendoza is difficult, but sometimes necessary.\n\n\"Two young pitchers out in Arizona that we like, that have some upside,\" he said. \"Obviously, they're a little ways away from the major Leagues, being both 19 years old. So, guys that definitely have some potential to continue to grow and develop and develop into major league pitchers. But, for us to acquire Max and Jordan, we thought it was a worthwhile deal for us to make, because they're two guys that can help our Major League team here in the near future.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Walmart)\n\nIf millennials were hoping jokes about their age group would fade, a new Hasbro game isn't offering much relief.\n\n\"Monopoly for Millennials\" \u2014 the recently released version of the classic board game \u2014 centers around the often-mocked generation of people born between 1981 and 1996.\n\nThe cover features \"Monopoly\" icon Rich Uncle Pennybags with a cup of coffee, earbuds and a medal labeled \"participation.\" The tagline on the cover reads: \"Forget real estate. You can't afford it anyway.\"\n\nBut plenty of people seem able to handle the price of the game. It sells for $19.82, and Walmart's website currently lists the product as \"out of stock.\"\n\nThough the board features the traditional \"Go To Jail\" space, there is a major difference in this version of the classic game: Instead of collecting money, players will be collecting experiences as they traverse the board. These experiences include \"Parents' Basement,\" \"Thrift Shop\" and \"Farmers' Market.\"\n\n\"Money doesn't always buy a great time, but experiences, whether they're good -- or weird -- last forever,\" says the game's description on Walmart's website. The description also notes that \"adulting is hard.\"\n\nIn reaction to Hasbro's newest product, many people took to Twitter to express their feelings towards the game.\n\nSome found the game to be an unfair portrayal of their age demographic.\n\n@Hasbro Can you provide the URL for the Hasbro-official website featuring \"Monopoly for Millennials,\" where you trash on my age demographic because baby boomers caused an economic catastrophe that rendered us financially impotent for a decade?

Zhang (@jennygzhang) November 14, 2018\n\nAnd then there were those who just didn't know what to make of the game.\n\nPlayed Monopoly for Millennials last night and i was a bit taken aback. The instructions pretty much read like this...Money can\u2019t always buy you a great time, which is great because as a millennial you don\u2019t have any!

(Photo: Tim Loehrke, USA TODAY)\n\nThe head of the Food and Drug Administration says the agency is increasing its focus on drug quality to guard against impurities such as the potentially cancer-causing chemicals that have been found in three commonly prescribed blood pressure medications.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb spoke to USA TODAY on Wednesday after the recall of versions of valsartan, irbesartan and losartan.\n\nGottlieb said the agency has hired dozens of chemists to review pharmaceutical companies and monitor for any changes in manufacturing techniques. The increased scrutiny is intended to prevent drug impurities that may be harmful to consumers.\n\n\"We put out very big guidance on this \u2013 it's a known risk,\" Gottlieb said during a meeting with the USA TODAY editorial board on Wednesday. \"It's a place where there's been a significant increase in focus in recent years.\"\n\nThe FDA is still investigating the scope of the manufacturing problem that led to the recalls.\n\nSandoz Inc. recalled losartan potassium hydrochlorothiazide tablets this month because the pills could contain the probable carcinogen N-nitrosodiethylamine, or NDEA. That followed the recalls of valsartan and irbesartan.\n\nPatients who are currently taking versions of the recalled drugs are urged to talk with their pharmacist or doctor. Discontinuing use of a blood pressure drug could cause greater harm to a patient than the small increased risk of cancer.\n\nThe losartan potassium hydrochlorothiazide medication affected by the recall are 100 milligram/25 milligram tablets with the lot number JB8912. The contaminated medication was shipped after Oct. 8. It was made by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. in Linhai, China.\n\nA Sandoz representative said the drug company detected the impurity in its losartan drug ingredient during routine testing. Sandoz is the generic division of Swiss drug maker Novartis.\n\n\"We are exploring all possible options jointly with health authorities to facilitate a continuous supply of losartan to cover patient needs,\" spokeswoman Sofina Mirza-Reid said.\n\nThe wide-ranging investigation of the class of blood pressure medications called angiotensin II receptor blockers began June 19, officials said. That's when Prinston Pharmaceuticals notified the FDA about impurities found in its blood-pressure medication, valsartan, made by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer in Linhai, China.\n\nThe initial recall involved three drug companies that sold five versions of valsartan supplied by Zhejiang.\n\nSeveral batches of the recalled valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide were contaminated with the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA.\n\nZhejiang stopped sending the contaminated valsartan to the United States, the FDA said.\n\nFDA officials said the agency is still investigating whether Zhejiang or other manufacturers made contaminated versions of angiotensin II receptor blockers.\n\nThe FDA suspects that the impurities stemmed from changes in Zhejiang's manufacturing process.\n\nBut the agency has not yet verified the root cause of how the contaminants formed, and why they were not separated from the drug during the manufacturing process.\n\nThe FDA has tested samples of valsartan and other drugs at its laboratory in St. Louis, officials said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/14/fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-drug-recalls-iosartan-valsartan-irbesartan/2000575002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Oregon St women rout Arkansas-Pine Bluff 89-33", "description": "Destiny Slocum had 15 points and 11 assists as No. 8 Oregon State routed Arkansas-Pine Bluff 89-33", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2018/11/14/oregon-st-women-rout-arkansas-pine-bluff-89-33/38529153/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:08:09Z", "content": "CORVALLIS, Ore.

She had five points and five rebounds before fouling out. ... Arkansas-Pine Bluff was undersized, with the team's tallest starters at 6 foot. Oregon State had three starters taller, including 6-foot-8 center Joanna Grymek.\n\nOregon State: Wednesday was Oregon State's Beavers Beyond the Classroom game, and more than 40 elementary and middle schools attended the field trip event, turning up the volume in Gill Coliseum. The attendance was listed at 8,828. ... Forward Janessa Thropay didn't score but had eight steals, two shy of the team record.\n\nROUGH AND RUGGED: Kilbert said he wished officials would have cut down on Oregon State's roughness. \"In our league, there would have been a whistle blown every time down on that physical play. We never adjusted to it,\" he said. \"They're big, they're strong, so they want it to be a physical game. We want it to be a freedom of movement game.\"\n\nNO SCORING, NO PROBLEM: Thropay missed both of her shots and was the only Beavers player who didn't score. \"You don't have to score a point to have a major impact on a game\" Rueck said. \"I thought she set the tone for us in many ways once she got on the floor, and just took everything up a notch, and knocked the ball free and got us in transition.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArkansas-Pine Bluff plays at Minnesota on Tuesday.\n\nOregon State hosts St. Mary's on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He might be an RB1 the rest of the season and will prove it on Sunday.\n\nWR Amari Cooper, Dallas Cowboys\n\nThe chemistry with and trust from Dak Prescott is there \u2014 18 targets, 11 catches since he was acquired by the Cowboys. Playing the Falcons (30th vs. the pass) will be productive for both of them.\n\nTE Evan Engram, New York Giants\n\nHe\u2019s shown some signs of trending up in the last couple of games, and now he gets to face the Bucs.\n\nDuds\n\nQB Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings\n\nHe hasn\u2019t exactly been a stud game to game all season \u2014 four games with one touchdown pass and four contests with 250 yards or fewer. Although the Bears are tougher against the run than the pass, I\u2019d look elsewhere in a matchup against Chicago on the road.\n\nRB Marlon Mack, Indianapolis Colts\n\nTwo back-to-back 100-plus-yard games turned into a 12-carry, 29-yard performance against the Jaguars. His next matchup? The 10th-best run defense in the NFL in the Titans. You may have to start him due to bye weeks, but don\u2019t expect much.\n\nWR Tyler Boyd, Cincinnati Bengals\n\nHe\u2019s the No. 1 receiver with A.J. Green out, but the Ravens allow the third-fewest passing yards in the NFL.\n\nTEs Jack Doyle, Eric Ebron, Indianapolis Colts\n\nAs we usually say, you\u2019re not benching either in this tight end climate. But here are the problems: Does Ebron repeat last week\u2019s three-touchdown performance? Maybe. Does Doyle become the star TE he was against the Raiders, keeping Ebron\u2019s value down? Maybe. Can they do anything against the Titans, the stingiest defense against tight ends? Maybe. Not quite a \u201cdud\u201d situation, but not a \u201csleeper\u201d one either.\n\nSleepers\n\nQB Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens\n\nThis comes with a giant asterisk. John Harbaugh could elect to start Robert Griffin III over Joe Flacco if the latter sits with an injury, or Flacco could play through his hip problem. But if the first-rounder is in for the game against the Bengals, it\u2019s an intriguing matchup.\n\nRB Rashaad Penny, Seattle Seahawks\n\nChris Carson might be back. Mike Davis looked good last week. But so did Penny, and I\u2019m wondering if he plays a lot more as a pass-catcher on Thursday if Aaron Rodgers pulls the Packers ahead. It\u2019s a risky move, but that\u2019s why the waiver wire pickup of the week is in the sleepers column.\n\nWR Josh Reynolds, Los Angeles Rams\n\nCooper Kupp is done for the season and we know the Rams can support three wideouts. And in a shootout against the Chiefs, it\u2019s possible all three WRs (Robert Woods, Brandin Cooks and Reynolds) put up big numbers.\n\nTE Vance McDonald, Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nThe Jaguars have allowed the 11th-most fantasy points to tight ends (per ESPN) in 2018. Coming off a week in which he scored, you could start him and see if he\u2019ll find paydirt again."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press, Associated Press", "title": "'Little House on the Prairie' star Katherine MacGregor dies at 93", "description": "Katherine MacGregor, who played petty, gossiping mother Harriet Oleson on TV's \"Little House on the Prairie,\" has died at 93.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/14/little-house-prairie-star-katherine-macgregor-dies-93/2003846002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/14/USAT/bdba7630-423e-4058-9fc0-5b37884679cf-GettyImages-138432527.jpg?crop=1951,1110,x0,y89&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:07:55Z", "content": "What made 'Little House' so appealing?

They spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was confidential.\n\nBayern's internal documents from 2016 detailing an earlier breakaway plan was revealed by German magazine Der Spiegel, which has spearheaded the publication of confidential documents and emails from clubs and soccer bodies.\n\nUEFA President Aleksander Ceferin was joined Wednesday by players' union officials and European league delegates asking questions about the Super League plans at the most significant European soccer meeting since \"Football Leaks\" started.\n\nStill, the sources said leaders of the European Club Association (ECA) \u2014 from Juventus, Barcelona, Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Celtic \u2014 claimed in the meeting that they had not known of the Super League proposal being drafted in Madrid.\n\nNo one from Madrid attended the UEFA-hosted talks, though the club's vice chairman, Pedro Lopez, is a vice chairman of the 232-member ECA group.\n\nJuventus president Andrea Agnelli, the ECA chairman, declined to comment after the two-hour meeting.\n\nThe FIFPro union and European Leagues group had previously criticized the Super League plan, which was revealed in emails from Madrid-based consultants to the Spanish club.\n\nIt suggested a 16-team lineup to kick off in 2021, with 11 founding clubs to get ownership stakes and risk-free membership for 20 years. Five more clubs would be invited to play in what would effectively be a replacement for the Champions League, which shares more than $2 billion each season among 32 clubs but is controlled by UEFA.\n\nThe plan seemed to betray ECA leader Agnelli's repeated promise of no changes being made to the Champions League before 2024.\n\n\"All parties underlined their commitment to working together toward the development of club competitions under the leadership of UEFA,\" the European soccer body said in a statement about Wednesday's meeting, which did not mention the breakaway project.\n\nEuropean media reports have also detailed how some clubs \u2014 including Manchester City and PSG, backed by owners from royal families in Qatar and Abu Dhabi \u2014 evaded UEFA rules on sponsor deals and spending on transfers and wages.\n\nPSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, who arrived at UEFA to attend the second half of Wednesday's meeting, did not stop to talk with reporters.\n\nA proposal to add a third-tier European club competition, while cutting the Europa League group stage from 48 teams to 32, was also analyzed. It should be approved at a Dec. 3 meeting of UEFA's executive committee in Dublin.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He\u2019s such a known threat that contingency plans have already been put into place to contain him should something go wrong. While all the Avengers are extremely powerful, and, in turn could use their power to become a threat, it\u2019s the Hulk\u2019s inability to control his rage or even be aware of the consequences of his actions that make him so dangerous.\n\nPolygon makes a solid case for Iron Man being the most dangerous Avenger, but Tony\u2019s power isn\u2019t left unchecked. That\u2019s the whole reason we had an entire movie about a brawl in a Wal-Mart parking lot. When Tony gets out of line, people can and have stepped in. The Hulk though, with his unmatched strength and mindless rage, can be beyond reason, making him more dangerous.\n\nWilliams is no stranger to controversy, but this question may be harder to resolve than then the discussion about the GQ cover, which according to the GQ\u2019s research manager, is because the word was handwritten by Virgil Abloh of Off-White, who styles everything in quotation marks.\n\nAnyway, let the debate over the most dangerous Avenger rage.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Qatar scores late to stun Switzerland 1-0 in friendly", "description": "Qatar stunned eighth-ranked Switzerland 1-0 in an international friendly on Wednesday as Akram Afif's late goal gave the 2022 World Cup host a surprising victory", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/11/14/qatar-scores-late-to-stun-switzerland-1-0-in-friendly/38528757/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac401ed4ab032abd1fd13f3ef925ab5f9c757b3b/c=0-194-3737-2296/local/-/media/2018/11/14/USATODAY/usatsports/073e466cb4cd49c9a738631bd5656afc.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:28:17Z", "content": "Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri, left, fights for the ball with Qatar's Hassan Khalid Al Haidos during an international friendly soccer match between Switzerland and Qatar at the Cornaredo stadium in Lugano, Switzerland, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018.

It will also play in next year's Copa America in Brazil as one of the invited guests.\n\n\"When you're coaching a team like Qatar and you're facing a top team like we faced today we need to do more things that we are not used to do but that's the way to compete because at the moment Switzerland is No. 8 in the world, we're No. 96. This for a reason,\" Sanchez said.\n\nSwitzerland, which reached the last 16 in this year's World Cup in Russia and had kept nine clean sheets in its past 10 home matches, had wasted a number of chances to put the game away earlier and hit the post twice.\n\n\"It's a really awful defeat, it's a match almost to forget. We played really badly,\" Switzerland midfielder Remo Freuler said. \"We have to analyze what we did badly and I don't think we did anything well. ... I don't think we undervalued them but we never got into the match today.\"\n\nThe Swiss came into the game as massive favorites after putting six goals past Panama and Iceland this year, as well as scoring five against Hungary in 2017.\n\nThe last time Qatar played a European team it lost 2-1 at home against minnow Liechtenstein last December. Its last win against a European team was a 1-0 victory against Andorra last August. The tiny desert nation was awarded the 2022 World Cup in a disputed FIFA vote in 2010 despite never having qualified for the tournament before.\n\nAfif also drew a save from Mvogo in the 23rd minute, while Switzerland went closest in the 36th when Micahel Lang headed a corner off the inside of the right post.\n\nAfif thought he had given Qatar the lead at the end of the first half but he was offside when Ali flicked the ball on.\n\nSwitzerland made wholesale changes at halftime but even the introduction of Liverpool midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri didn't help \u2014 although his pass set up Christian Fassnacht for a shot that hit the crossbar.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Mike Ehrmann, Getty Images)\n\nST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. \u2014 For more than a decade on the PGA Tour, Johnson Wagner has witnessed his share of flair on the golf course. But earlier this year, he came across something he had never seen.\n\nAs he walked to the 10th tee at TPC San Antonio for the third round of the Valero Texas Open, he was joined by a member of his group, Ben Silverman, who told Wagner about the third player in the group.\n\n\u201cDude, wait until you see this guy hit a shot.\u201d\n\nThis guy was Cameron Champ \u2014 there\u2019s a name straight out of Madison Avenue \u2014 and Wagner watched intently on the tee of the 447-yard par-4 that was playing into the wind on a chilly day.\n\n\u201cMy jaw just dropped,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat hole is not as short and easy as he made it look. He probably had a sand wedge in and I had a 6-iron into the green. Such impressive ball flight, such impressive length. I\u2019ve never seen anybody flight and control a driver as he did that day.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fit, he\u2019s young, he\u2019s flexible and he\u2019s strong as a bull.\u201d\n\nThe legend of Champ is ever growing, an eye-popping yarn of a 6-0, 175-pound, 23-year-old who sports a 32-inch waist, 129 mph swing speed and 190 mph ball speed. In a game that features Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Bubba Watson, Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods and many other bombers, Champ might be the longest of them all.\n\nThe latest chapter in his growing tale is this week\u2019s RSM Classic at Sea Island Golf Club, where this wonder rookie is one of the favorites three weeks after winning his first PGA Tour title at the Sanderson Farms Championship. He also was in Sunday contention in his last two starts before finishing in ties for 10th and 28th.\n\nWhile his power gets all the headlines \u2014 he led the Web.com Tour in driving distance last year at 343 yards a pop and leads the PGA Tour this season at 335 yards \u2014 he isn\u2019t just a brute force of nature. While he can fly an 8-iron 180 yards swinging at 80% of his capacity and a 2-iron 270 yards, his skill set is ever improving, from his touch on and around the greens to his precision off the tee and into the greens.\n\nAnd on equal footing with his power and precision is his poise, an even-keel, gentle demeanor that keeps his game and ego in check despite all the attention.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely noticed the attention, but I try to just ignore that kind of stuff,\u201d Champ said. \u201cI just try to focus on what I'm doing. Obviously, everyone likes to talk about my distance, so I think that's one thing I've really blocked out. Just try to focus on other aspects of my game, just my game in general, and I feel like I've handled that pretty well so far.\u201d\n\nStill, a lot of his peers are still trying to get a handle on how far Champ hits the golf ball with an effortless swing. So, too, is Sean Foley, swing coach to Justin Rose and former swing coach of Woods, who saw Champ for the first time eight years ago.\n\nCameron Champ hit eight drives 340 yards or longer @Sanderson_Champ. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\n\nHe's the 42nd winner on TOUR to hit eight or more drives 340 yards or longer in an event in the ShotLink era (Since 2003). pic.twitter.com/RdL4upYogy \u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) October 30, 2018\n\n\u201cI was blown away,\u201d said Foley, who has worked with Champ the past six years. \u201cI\u2019m still blown away. He was 14 when he came to see me. He had big legs. So that day, he was hitting a 4-iron. He hit it and I said, \u2018Oh (expletive).\u2019 At that time, I\u2019m watching Justin Rose and Tiger and I was hanging out on the range with Rory McIlroy and all the rest of them, so how was I going to be blown away by anyone? Well, I was blown away by a 14-year-old.\u201d\n\nAnd there was the 9-hole Monday practice round at the 2017 U.S. Open at Erin Hills in Wisconsin. Champ, who won just one tournament at Texas A&M, qualified for the national championship and then teed it up with McIlroy before tying for 32nd. And Champ outdrove McIlroy on every hole.\n\n\u201cSomething happened to Cameron that day,\u201d Foley said. \u201cHe saw he could play golf on an elite level.\u201d\n\nThere are so many other stories about the power of Champ, but he\u2019s working hard with Foley to change the narrative. Call the project DJ 2.0, a nod to Dustin Johnson, who harnessed his power and built up his short-iron talents that had plagued him to become No. 1 in the world.\n\n\u201cAthletic players hit it far, and then once they learn how to hit wedges like DJ did, then the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d said Champ, who has risen more than 100 spots in the world rankings to No. 107 since the season started. \u201cI rarely hit a full shot unless it's a calm day. I like to flight shots lower, my numbers are more consistent that way, instead of just throwing it up in the sky. That's one thing I've really worked on in the last few years.\n\n\u201cNow I'm very comfortable with it and it's kind of my go-to.\u201d\n\nFoley said Champ didn\u2019t have a handle on controlling the distances of his short clubs just five years ago, so the two went to work on that. The improvement has been drastic, but the work continues.\n\n\u201cHis golf IQ is increasing,\u201d Foley said. \u201cHe\u2019s concentrated on the areas of his game that needed attention. And length has never needed his attention.\n\n\u201cIs Cameron going to go out there and beat up the DJs and Koepkas and Roses and Tigers? No. But he has the potential to be the No. 1 player in the world some day. But he has a long way to go and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s sure to be quite the ride. En route to winning last week\u2019s Mayakoba Golf Classic, Matt Kuchar played with Champ for the first time.\n\n\u201cHe's going to do damage out here,\u201d Kuchar said. \u201cHe's going to be kind of the future of the game of golf.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not doing too badly in the present, either."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Richmond pushes past St Francis Brooklyn 88-66", "description": "Nick Sherod scored 22 points, Grant Golden added 20 points and Richmond beat St. Francis Brooklyn 88-66", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/14/richmond-pushes-past-st-francis-brooklyn-88-66/38528555/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:07:38Z", "content": "RICHMOND, Va.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) \u2014 Lamar Jackson isn't staying awake at night thinking about the prospect of making his first NFL start.\n\nBaltimore Ravens starting quarterback Joe Flacco missed practice Wednesday because of a hip injury, and his status for Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals is uncertain.\n\nIf Flacco can't go, coach John Harbaugh likely will turn to Jackson, whose first pro season thus far has been spent taking a few snaps per game in run situations.\n\n\"I'm going into it just like any other week. Just preparing for whatever,\" Jackson said. \"Everything is still the same.\"\n\nStarting at quarterback for a team desperate to end a three-game skid might cause some rookies to squirm, but Jackson insisted he's sleeping \"like a baby.\"\n\nFlacco hurt his hip early in a 23-16 loss to Pittsburgh on Nov. 4. He had the bye week to recover, but is still receiving treatment, meaning his availability for Baltimore (4-5) against the Bengals (5-4) could come down to a game-time decision.\n\nHarbaugh appears done talking about it.\n\n\"Rather than tip my toe in the water and start answering one question and then not answering the next one, I'm just not going to get into it. I'm just going to leave it alone,\" he said. \"I feel like we don't owe anybody any answers.\"\n\nIf Flacco can't play, veteran Robert Griffin III will likely serve as backup to the rookie he's been mentoring since summer. Griffin, like Jackson, was a running quarterback who had to make the transition into a passing league.\n\nGriffin won the Heisman Trophy as a junior at Baylor and finished with 2,254 yards rushing with 33 touchdowns. Jackson won the Heisman in 2016 and finished with 4,132 yards on the ground with 50 touchdowns.\n\nNow they're together in Baltimore, trying to get the Ravens into the postseason.\n\n\"Everybody wants to be a part of a winner,\" Griffin said. \"This franchise has done a lot of winning; we just got to make sure that we get back to that.\"\n\nAfter sitting out last season, Griffin launched his comeback by signing in April with the Ravens, presumably to be Flacco's backup. He dropped to No. 3 on the depth chart soon after Baltimore traded up to get Jackson in the first round.\n\nThough he has 41 career starts (including playoffs), Griffin will likely serve as a backup Sunday if Flacco can't play. At least he will be in uniform after spending the first nine weeks on the inactive list.\n\n\"I haven't been OK not playing,\" Griffin said. \"I think if I was OK not playing, then I wouldn't be the competitor that I've grown to be. But within that, you have to control what you can.\"\n\nHe will do what he's asked on Sunday, but makes no secret of his desire to start.\n\n\"It would be awesome,\" Griffin said. \"It's been a heck of a journey, but coming here was the best thing I could've done. Knowing what it means to play like a Raven and growing with these guys has been something that's been real special for me. If I get that opportunity to go out there and play, I'm going to make most of it and show these guys not only how hard I've been working, but how much I believe in them.\"\n\nGriffin wants to win, and his main contribution toward that end has been to make the 21-year-old Jackson a better quarterback.\n\n\"It's been great. I didn't think I'd be a big brother at 28,\" Griffin said. \"I've got two older sisters, I'm the baby of the family, but it's been great to take Lamar under my wing and kind of be that big-brother figure to him.

(Photo: David Maialetti, The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP)\n\nThere was a loud bang, and suddenly the Southwest Airlines jet rolled 41 degrees to the left. Smoke began to fill the cabin, and flight attendants rushed row by row to make sure all passengers could get oxygen from their masks.\n\nWhen flight attendant Rachel Fernheimer got to row 14, she saw a woman still restrained by her lap belt but with her head, torso and arm hanging out a window.\n\nFernheimer grabbed one of the woman's legs while flight attendant Seanique Mallory grabbed her lower body. They described being unable to bring the woman back in the plane until two male passengers stepped in to help.\n\nThe harrowing details from the fatal April flight were released for the first time as the National Transportation Safety Board began a hearing Wednesday into the engine failure on Southwest Flight 1380, which carried 144 passengers and five crew members.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to reach the pilots by intercom because of the rush of air and noise, Mallory was finally able to relay the situation to Tammie Jo Shults and Darren Ellisor, who had already planned an emergency landing of the crippled Boeing 737-700 in Philadelphia.\n\n\"We got (unintelligible words) a window open and somebody - is out the window,\" Mallory said. According to a transcript, she adds a little later, \"Yeah everyone still in their seats, we have people have been helpin' her get in I don't know what her condition is, but the window is completely out.\"\n\nThe flight attendants told investigators at least one of the male passengers put his arm out of the window and wrapped it around the woman's shoulder to help pull her back in. Fernheimer said when she looked out the window, she could see that one of the plane's engines was shattered, and there was blood on the outside of the aircraft.\n\nThe passenger in the window seat, Jennifer Riordan, was fatally injured \u2014 the first death on a U.S. airline flight since 2009. Eight other passengers including at least one of the men who helped pull Riordan back in the window, suffered minor injuries.\n\nOne of the men, an EMT in Texas, and a retired school nurse began CPR on Riordan, but according to interviews with investigators, they said her injuries seemed too severe. Emergency personnel took over once the plane landed, and passengers gathered her belongings to send with them.\n\nThe accident was triggered by an engine fan blade that broke off. A piece of engine cover struck and shattered the window next to Riordan, a 43-year-old mother of two from Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nWednesday's hearing in Washington focused on design and inspection of fan blades on the engine, made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran S.A.\n\nA spokeswoman for CFM said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the company could not comment on an active investigation, but noted that it had \"responded aggressively\" to complete blade inspections after the fatal flight before an Aug. 31 deadline.\n\nThe blade that broke had made about 32,000 flights. An examination indicated that it probably was beginning to suffer cracks from metal fatigue when it was last inspected in 2012, said Mark Habedank, an engineering official at CFM. But the crack was smaller than could be detected by the test used at the time, which used fluorescent dye.\n\nAfter the fatal accident, CFM recommended the use of more sophisticated tests using ultrasound or electrical currents. The company also recommended much more frequent inspections and lubrication of the blades.\n\nA broken fan blade had triggered a similar engine failure with shrapnel on another Southwest flight, in August 2016 over Florida.\n\nAn FAA expert on engines, Christopher Spinney, said the agency considered the Florida incident \"very unexpected.\"\n\n\"We determined early that we would require some corrective action in that it was an unsafe condition,\" Spinney said, \"but we also determined we had some time.\"\n\nRather than issue an emergency order for fan blade inspections after the 2016 incident, the FAA began a normal process for new regulations, which includes a chance for the public to comment and takes longer. That process was still underway when the fatal accident occurred.\n\nFan blades have been thought to have no real lifetime limit. CFM and FAA officials said they were now considering whether blades must be replaced at some point even if they don't show wear.\n\nRepresentatives from CFM, Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration were also expected to be questioned about design of the engine housing, which is supposed to prevent pieces from breaking loose.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2018/11/14/hearing-reveals-chilling-details-fatal-southwest-flight/2002783002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Walmart, Ford to test driveless deliveries", "description": "Ford Motor Company is partnering with Walmart and Postmates to study how consumers would handle self-driving cars making deliveries to their doors.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/2018/11/14/walmart-ford-test-driveless-deliveries/2002946002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/13/PDTF/63cac9f6-2047-4544-98de-114773936e5a-FordWalmart.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:53:34Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, William Cummings, USA TODAY", "title": "Ted Olson led Republicans to victory in Bush v.

(Nov. 8) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Attorney Theodore B. Olson, the legal heavyweight best known for taking the Republicans' winning case before the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore, is one of the attorneys representing CNN in its lawsuit against the Trump administration over the revocation of correspondent Jim Acosta's White House press credentials.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has held in no uncertain terms that the First Amendment protects 'robust political debate,' including speech that it is critical of those who hold public office,\" Olson said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Mr. Acosta\u2019s press credentials must be restored so that all members of the press know they will remain free to ask tough questions, challenge government officials, and report the business of the nation to the American people.\"\n\nAcosta's credentials were taken after a wild press conference last week in which President Donald Trump called the reporter a \"rude, terrible person\" as Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone. It was the latest in a number of tense exchanges between Acosta and the president.\n\nCNN announced Tuesday that it filed a lawsuit against Trump and other administration officials to get Acosta's credentials restored. USA TODAY and its parent company Gannett joined other news media organizations Wednesday in a filing friend-of-the-court briefs on CNN's behalf in the case.\n\nIn addition to his work on behalf of President George W. Bush in the Florida recount for the 2000 presidential election, Olson is also known for helping draft the legal arguments that led to the overturning of Proposition 8 in California, which banned same-sex marriage. Olson teamed up with attorney David Boies \u2013 the man who represented Vice President Al Gore's in 2000 \u2013 for that 2014 case.\n\nFormer Solicitor General Ted Olson testifies on a panel of experts and character witnesses before the Senate Judiciary Committee on behalf of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Sept. 7, 2018, in Washington. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nOlson won another landmark case before the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. FEC, in the which the court ruled that political contributions are a form of free speech and protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIn March, Olson, 77, turned down an offer to join President Donald Trump's legal team to help defend the president in the face of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling, according to a report from The Washington Post.\n\nLast month, Olson resigned as a member of the American Bar Association after the organization called for the FBI to investigate the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the National Law Journal reported. He also testified as a character witness on Kavanaugh's behalf.\n\nOlson is a partner in the Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher law firm, which is based in Los Angeles.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/11/14/trump-v-cnn-ted-olson-who-won-bush-v-gore-takes-up-acostas-case/1997502002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Sara M Moniuszko, USA TODAY", "title": "Juliette Lewis rocks out to Britney Spears, asks her to 'save us' in NSFW viral video", "description": "Although her video was interpreted by some as a cry for help, the actress explained in the caption that she was simply trying to \"make people smile.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/14/juliette-lewis-rocks-out-britney-spears-viral-video/2002561002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5858221892d8bb3da24758d38b1abead9f2773c2/c=0-124-1992-1250/local/-/media/2017/01/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636196351992803336-GTY-623261106-86720782.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:50:24Z", "content": "Juliette Lewis attends ELLE's 25th Annual Women In Hollywood Celebration on Oct. 15, 2018 in Los Angeles.

From The Athletic:\n\n\u201cWith what was said, there is already no way Durant is coming back,\u201d one player said. \u201cThe only hope is that they can say this summer, \u2018See, KD. We\u2019ve got your back. We protected you from Draymond.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo as we did with LeBron James in the middle of his final season with the Cavaliers, we\u2019re power ranking every landing spot \u2014 regardless of cap space \u2014 the forward could look at next summer.\n\n29. Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nThis is the scenario I most want to have happen but there\u2019s NO WAY he\u2019s going back there. Can you imagine the social media explosion if he went back to play with Russell Westbrook again?\n\n28. Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nIf he wants to win a ring in the near future, he probably wants to steer clear of LeBron James\u2019 old stomping grounds.\n\n27. Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nWould YOU want to go there after all that Jimmy Butler drama? Didn\u2019t think so.\n\n26. Memphis Grizzlies\n\nAdding Durant won\u2019t elevate this roster to a contender, so they\u2019re out.\n\n25. Orlando Magic\n\nNah.\n\n24. Chicago Bulls\n\nThey\u2019re not quite there yet with their rebuild.\n\n23. Charlotte Hornets\n\nNot much beyond Kemba Walker, but the bigger issue is: Does Durant want to be bugged by Michael Jordan all the time to be better? I wouldn\u2019t if I was him.\n\n22. Detroit Pistons\n\nAmong the reasons why he wouldn\u2019t want to go there: Where would he fit with Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond there?\n\n21. Sacramento Kings\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, they\u2019re 8-6 and the eighth seed in the West! That won\u2019t last this season, but the future is suddenly kind of bright in Sacramento. It\u2019s just not enough to entice Durant to come to the California capital.\n\n20. Phoenix Suns\n\nI guess if he wants to take on the challenge of teaching a young team how to win, this would be higher up. It just doesn\u2019t seem like Durant\u2019s M.O. right now. Although, as you\u2019ll see below, he does love Phoenix as a city.\n\n19. Philadelphia 76ers\n\nIf you just spent a few years getting destroyed by critics for going to a super-team and turning them into a mega-super-team, why would you do it again?\n\n18. Portland Trail Blazers\n\nThey should be higher: Durant is a Nike guy, and maybe he\u2019d want to give the Blazers what they should have had in 2007 when they took (wince) Greg Oden ahead of him. But after he ripped this team on C.J. McCollum\u2019s podcast and got into a Twitter fight with the guard, I think that ship has sailed.\n\n17. Washington Wizards\n\nI know: He\u2019s from Washington D.C. But he\u2019s not going home just to play with a team that\u2019s seriously underachieving and that may tear it all down by the trade deadline.\n\n16. Atlanta Hawks\n\nI was going to put him lower but then I saw these photos posted by Trae Young\u2019s dad. IT\u2019S A SIGN.\n\nYep it still doesn\u2019t seem real. Wish I could share some of the advice this guy has given my son over the years. And now tonight he\u2019ll be on the same court with him. Trae is calm & cool about it.

Dallas Mavericks\n\nHe did play a year with Texas before jumping to the NBA, and joining Dennis Smith Jr. and Luka Doncic while also taking the torch from Dirk Nowitzki sounds mildly fun.\n\n14. Miami Heat\n\nI\u2019m just sticking them here because Pat Riley is convincing and Miami is where everyone wants to be.\n\n13. San Antonio Spurs\n\nWho doesn\u2019t want to play for Gregg Popovich? The problem is the roster situation doesn\u2019t scream contender even if Durant was there.\n\n12. Boston Celtics\n\nHe\u2019s pals with Kyrie Irving. That\u2019s got to be worth a lot. At the moment, however, Danny Ainge would have to do quite a bit of maneuvering to carve out room for Durant due to a crowded roster. There\u2019s no doubt he\u2019d do it if he realized he had a chance, especially since he said he was close to getting Durant in 2016.\n\n11. Milwaukee Bucks\n\nPutting Greek Freak and Durant together could either be the greatest thing ever or a total disaster. ALL THE WINGSPAN!\n\n10. Indiana Pacers\n\nHe and Victor Oladipo would make a really fun pairing.\n\n9. New Orleans Pelicans\n\nThe Brow and KD. Together. And New Orleans is a really fun city.\n\n8. Toronto Raptors\n\nThis assumes Kawhi Leonard stays. The already-talented Raptors immediately become the East\u2019s best team (if that isn\u2019t the case now). So why aren\u2019t they higher? Durant gets the \u201cRING CHASER\u201d label again.\n\n7. Houston Rockets\n\nThey do have room at power forward \u2026 and wouldn\u2019t it be delicious if he decided to stick it to Green by playing on the Warriors\u2019 biggest rival? Same problem as joining the Raps, though.\n\n6. Denver Nuggets\n\nPotential 2019 free agent Kevin Durant on C.J. McCollum\u2019s @PullUpPod podcast: \"I like Denver a lot, it\u2019s super chill.

Utah Jazz\n\nFrom a pure basketball perspective, this team might be one Durant away from being a complete squad. He and Donovan Mitchell would handle the scoring, Rudy Gobert would continue to be a defensive nightmare \u2026 you see it, don\u2019t you?\n\n4. Brooklyn Nets\n\nIf he loves the idea of playing in New York, this is a great option. There\u2019s so many young pieces in Caris LeVert, D\u2019Angelo Russell, Jarrett Allen and others, and he\u2019d get to be the No. 1 superstar that brings them all together without the pressure of playing at Madison Square Garden.\n\n3. New York Knicks\n\nIf Durant wants to add \u201cwon a championship and saved New York from basketball hell\u201d to his resume, this is the spot. But can the Knicks put together a contending roster around him? And will he be able to withstand the tabloid drama that will come with him playing at MSG?\n\n2. Los Angeles Clippers\n\nThis assumes another superstar (Leonard?) come along for the ride. And he gets to have a Los Angeles rivalry with LeBron James? Hmm.\n\n1.

(Photo: Rich Pedroncelli, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Kevin McCarthy defeated Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, to become House minority leader Wednesday.\n\nMcCarthy, from California, beat Jordan, who is from Ohio, 159-43, according to McCarthy's spokeswoman Erin Perrine.\n\nJordan, who helped found the Freedom Caucus \u2013 a group of more than 30 conservatives known for bucking their party\u2019s leadership \u2013 was not expected to win.\n\nMcCarthy called the House GOP leadership conference a \u201chealthy debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to thank Jim Jordan for running,\u201d he said after the vote.\n\nPolitico reported Wednesday that President Donald Trump had urged McCarthy to give Jordan the top GOP slot on the powerful House Judiciary Committee. McCarthy's team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about that issue.\n\nLouisiana Rep. Steve Scalise was elected minority whip; he has held the position in the majority.\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney will be Republican conference chair. Her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, stopped by the meeting Wednesday.\n\nNEW: Former VP Dick Cheney walks into the House GOP Conference Leadership election with his daughter Rep @Liz_Cheney who is running today for GOP Conference Chair @NBCNews@MSNBCpic.twitter.com/SGKj8FyWLJ \u2014 Alex Moe (@AlexNBCNews) November 14, 2018\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Mark Walker, head of the Republican Study Committee, will be vice chair.\n\nNewly elected House members, in town for orientation, participated in the leadership vote.\n\nAfter the vote, McCarthy said, \u201cWe serve in a divided government in a divided country. Our goal is to unite us back together again.\"\n\nHe said his second goal is winning back the majority.\n\n\u201cWe know the challenge of what we\u2019re working on. We wanted to hit the ground running. We know the Democrats have a plan: they want to disrupt, they want to try to impeach, and they want to stall what achievements we\u2019ve been able to move forward. But we know America is too great for such a small vision.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy said he was proud of the GOP\u2019s accomplishments of the last Congress: low employment, changes to Veterans Affairs, rebuilding the U.S. military and getting raises for service members, combating the opioid epidemic, and ending online human trafficking. But he said the party's work isn\u2019t done.\n\n\u201cWe will work with anybody across that aisle if they are there to work to move America forward. But let me be very clear: If their agenda is simply investigations, impeachment, and not focused on the hard-working American public, we\u2019ll be there to defend the American public.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s official @GOPLeader is running for minority leader pic.twitter.com/MBdOBklzRE \u2014 Eliza Collins (@elizacollins1) November 7, 2018\n\nThe victory Wednesday was not a surprise to McCarthy. He told Politico last week that he expected to win.\n\n\u201cI had the votes the first day,\u201d he said. Retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., had endorsed his deputy, and McCarthy is close to President Trump.\n\nDemocrats flipped more than 35 seats last week, taking back control of the House and forcing Republicans into the minority. The Democratic leadership election will take place later this month. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is expected to be elected speaker, but she faces opposition from a bloc of newcomers and a handful of incumbents.\n\nMcCarthy, elected to Congress in 2006, quickly moved up within the party, most recently holding the majority leader position. In 2015, it appeared he would succeed retiring speaker John Boehner of Ohio. At the last minute, he was forced to pull his bid after it became clear he would not get the 218 votes required to be speaker. Ryan eventually took the job.\n\nThe incoming GOP conference will be smaller and more conservative. With a handful of exceptions, Republicans knocked out in the midterms were from the party\u2019s moderate and establishment wings. And some safe GOP seats left open by members who retired or left office were filled by more conservative members.\n\nSenators of both parties also had their leadership elections Wednesday morning, but there were no major changes. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will remain the Senate majority leader and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., will continue as the Democratic leader.\n\nIn a press conference Wednesday morning, McConnell vowed to work across the aisle with the Democrat-controlled House.\n\n\"We'll be looking for ways now that we have divided government again to make some progress for the country,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe Republicans' No. 2 position is term-limited so Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, will leave leadership. South Dakota Sen. John Thune will take his place. Other Republicans will move up, which left an opening for the No. 5 spot. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst got that job.\n\nErnst's post will mark the first time in nearly a decade that a GOP woman has had an elected seat at the leadership table. The last woman in the group was Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in 2010. After losing the Republican primary, she left the post. Although Murkowski went on to a win a write-in campaign for Senate, she did not return to leadership.\n\nDemocrats had no shake-ups.\n\nMore: Elections roundup: Sinema wins in Arizona, but Florida and Georgia races still too close to call\n\nMore: Newly empowered Democrats gear up for a barrage of Trump investigations: It will be 'all hands on deck'\n\nMore: New 'Year of the Woman'?

(Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nATLANTA -- He is the perfect fit, the kid who grew up a New York Yankees fan, idolized one of their most famous players, and wants to be the man to lead them back to the World Series, ending the reign of terror by the Boston Red Sox.\n\nHe is Manny Machado, one of the greatest young players to hit the free agent market.\n\nAnd this time, after all the years of trying to get below the luxury tax, the Yankees have no financial restrictions on signing the guy who could be the centerpiece of their infield for the next 10 years.\n\nThe $300 million question is whether the Yankees have the same interest in Machado as he has in them.\n\nThe Yankees have yet to publicly declare their interest in signing Machado, 26, and say they first want to address the void in their starting rotation. But if they decide they want Machado, they need to talk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just important,\u2019\u2019 Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner said. \u201cIt\u2019s essential.\u2019\u2019\n\nThey need to have a heart-to-heart chat with Machado about exactly what he meant when he uttered the infamous words that he didn\u2019t want to be \u201cJohnny Hustle,\u2019\u2019 during a Fox postseason interview.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a $300 million guy or a $10 million guy,\u2019\u2019 Steinbrenner said at the Major League Baseball owners\u2019 meetings, \u201cclearly those comments are troubling.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s really [GM Brian Cashman\u2019s] job. If we\u2019re interested in any player, to sit down with them face to face and ask him, 'Where did this come from? What was the context around the entire interview? Was there a point? How do you justify it?'\n\n\u201cBecause that ain\u2019t going to sell where we play baseball.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen asked how important it was to determine whether Machado simply misspoke, or actually meant those words, Steinbrenner didn\u2019t blink.\n\n\u201cThat conversation will happen,\u2019\u2019 Steinbrenner said.\n\nMachado, who also kicked Milwaukee Brewers first baseman Jesus Aguilar\u2019s leg while running to first base during the National League Championship Series, caused a commotion with his comments during a pregame show when asked about hustling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to change,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the type of player that\u2019s going to be 'Johnny Hustle,' and run down the line and slide to first base \u2026 and you know, whatever can happen. That\u2019s just not my personality. That\u2019s not my cup of tea. That\u2019s not who I am.\u2019\u2019\n\nMachado told his teammates and several friends that he intended to say, \u2018Not False Johnny Hustle,' but realized the words can cause any team to pause before possibly making him the highest-paid player in baseball history.\n\nSteinbrenner says he will talk in the next few weeks with Alex Rodriguez, who has known Machado since he was a 16-year-old growing up in Miami.\n\n\u201cWe (have) just begun this process,\u2019\u2019 Steinbrenner said. \u201cOur pro scouting meetings started two weeks ago. So, they still are going through many players, many options, many possibilities.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Yankees, after watching the Boston Red Sox win the World Series this year and capture three consecutive AL East titles, don\u2019t plan to be part of the Red Sox's parade planning committee. It\u2019s tough enough for them when they don\u2019t win a World Series, but even more painful when it\u2019s the Red Sox who do.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to win a world championship,\u2019\u2019 Steinbrenner said, \u201cso it\u2019s going to hurt me no matter who it is. Clearly, having our biggest rival doing it, hurts more. Absolutely.\n\n\u201cBut the pain was still significant.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe perfect cure-all for that acid reflux is to find a way to finally topple the Red Sox, who have won four World Series since 2004 and are acting like the Yankees of old, blowing right past the $197 million luxury tax with a $240 million payroll.\n\nThe Yankees already have re-signed veteran starter CC Sabathia and left fielder Brett Gardner this winter, but Steinbrenner knows it\u2019s not near enough to catch the Red Sox. The Yankees still plan to trade starter Sonny Gray, and perhaps a few of their prized prospects, to get at least two front-line pitchers, before they would attempt to bring in Machado.\n\n\u201cWe have to add pieces,\" Steinbrenner said. \"Our starting pitching struggled in October. That much was obvious. We have work to do.\n\n\u201cWe need a team that\u2019s going to win a championship. That\u2019s what our fans expect. It\u2019s never out of our mind. It\u2019s in our DNA.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Yankees won 100 games last season, so it\u2019s hardly as if they need to make household changes. They just need to make the right ones. They not only need to find players with high character to fit into their clubhouse, but players who can handle New York.\n\n\u201cNew York is a tough place to play with the media, and the fans are very demanding. The makeup has to be there. That\u2019s a concern for any free agent,\u2019\u2019 Steinbrenner said.\n\nThe Yankees, Steinbrenner said, already have lopped free agents off their wish list who they believe can\u2019t cut it in New York.\n\nMachado still is on that list. But, they still must have that talk.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @BNightengale"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "As many as 9 SEC schools could have 1st-round draft picks", "description": "Alabama set an SEC record with 12 players taken in the 2018 NFL draft including four in the first round, and this season as many as 9 SEC schools could have players drafted in 1st round", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/14/as-many-as-9-sec-schools-could-have-1st-round-draft-picks/38528277/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff042338de95b64c169a292fa5fb09b7ca33bc0e/c=0-1064-2086-2237/local/-/media/2018/11/14/USATODAY/usatsports/0afb53a61cdf44339e30902759b16852.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:41:31Z", "content": "Florida defensive lineman Jachai Polite (99) does a chest bump with a teammate after stopping a South Carolina drive late in fourth quarter in an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Gainesville, Fla.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) \u2014 Alabama set an SEC record with 12 players taken in the 2018 NFL draft, including four in the first round.\n\nThe top-ranked Crimson Tide are sure to have several high draft picks in next year's draft, too, but there are players at many other SEC schools that are also likely to hear their names called in the first round of the 2019 draft.\n\nAccording to several mock draft boards the SEC could have first-rounders from as many as nine schools.\n\nNot surprisingly the top-rated SEC prospect with two weeks left in the regular season is from Alabama. Offensive tackle Jonah Williams is picked by some to be drafted as high as No. 2 after starting all 39 games in his career with the Crimson Tide and earning All-America honors at left tackle last season.\n\n\"He's one of those guys that's a perfectionist\" Alabama coach Nick Saban said. \"He wants to be the best player and he's one of the guys that's willing to do the things that you have to do to be the best player.\"\n\nOther possible first-round picks from Alabama include defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, safety Deionte Thompson, defensive lineman Raekwon Davis, linebacker Mack Wilson and running back Damien Harris.\n\nLSU has two top-20 prospects in cornerback Greedy Williams and linebacker Devin White. Williams led the SEC with six interceptions as a redshirt freshman last season and has two interceptions and 28 tackles and has defended eight passes this year. White ranked first in the country with 96 assisted tackles last season and has 89 tackles, including seven for losses, a forced fumble and two fumble recoveries this year.\n\nKentucky hasn't had a player taken in the past two drafts with the Wildcats' most recent draft pick coming when Josh Forrest was selected by the Rams in the sixth round in 2016. Their drought should end this year with outside linebacker Josh Allen expected to be chosen in the first round. If he is, it will give the Wildcats a first-round pick for the first time since Bud Dupree was selected by the Steelers with the 22nd overall pick in the 2015 draft.\n\nKentucky coach Mark Stoops isn't shy about bragging about his star player and called him the: \"best defensive player in the country,\" on his radio show last month.\n\nAllen, who is a senior, leads the SEC in tackles for losses (16) and sacks (11) and his five forced fumbles lead the nation. The 6-foot-5, 260-pound Allen has 65 tackles and has recovered two fumbles.\n\nMississippi could have two first-round picks with offensive lineman Greg Little and wide receiver A.J. Brown both projected to be top-25 selections. The Rebels entered the season with three first-round prospects, but receiver D.K. Metcalf could choose to return for another season after suffering a season-ending neck injury which required surgery last month.\n\nBrown's 72 receptions and 1,047 yards receiving both lead the SEC and he's had five 100-yard receiving games this season, including three in a row. The 6-1, 225 pound Brown became the school's all-time leading receiver in a loss to Texas A&M on Saturday. He has 2,711 yards receiving to move in front of Shay Hodge, who had 2,646 yards receiving from 2006-09.\n\n\"Been around a lot of great receivers here at Ole Miss, for him to be the all-time leading receiver, that's a pretty special accomplishment for him,\" Mississippi coach Matt Luke said. \"He's been very unselfish, playing inside, playing outside. He's very versatile. That will do nothing but help him going forward, his ability to do a bunch of different things.\"\n\nGeorgia, which had three first-round picks selected in the 2018 draft, could have another one next year in cornerback Deandre Baker. He flirted with the draft last offseason before returning for his senior year and has two interceptions and leads the SEC with nine passes defended.\n\nMississippi State has two defensive linemen who are among the best in the nation and could both be first-round draft picks. Jeffery Simmons, a 6-4, 300-pound tackle, is a three-year starter whose 12\u00bd tackles for losses rank fourth in the SEC. Simmons has 27\u00bd tackles for losses and five sacks and has piled up 148 tackles in his career.\n\nMontez Sweat is a defensive end who led the SEC with 16 tackles for losses and 11 sacks last season. This year he also ranks high on the SEC charts and is fourth with 13 tackles for losses and second with 10 sacks.\n\nAt Missouri, two offensive stars could be selected in the first round in 2019. Tight end Albert Okwuegbunam led the SEC with 11 touchdown receptions last season and is fourth this year with six TD grabs and has 466 yards receiving. His quarterback Drew Lock could join him as a first-round pick after a four-year career where he's thrown for 11,342 yards and 92 touchdowns with just 39 interceptions.\n\nLock led the nation with 44 touchdown passes last season and ranks second in the SEC this year with 21 TD tosses. He has thrown for 2,647 yards which also ranks second.\n\nFlorida has a top-10 draft prospect in defensive lineman Jachai Polite. The junior is third in the country with four forced fumbles and his 12\u00bd tackles for losses and 7\u00bd sacks are both No. 4 in the SEC.\n\nDefensive tackle Derrick Brown could be the first player from Auburn taken in the first round since the Tigers had two first-rounders in 2014. Brown has 9\u00bd tackles for losses and 3\u00bd sacks this season and has 20 tackles for losses and 8 sacks in three years at Auburn.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday that legislation overhauling how Congress deals with sexual harassment within its ranks will be passed before the new session starts.\n\nSpeaking at the Senate Republican leadership press conference, McConnell said he\u2019s talked about the bill \u201cat length\u201d with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who has taken the lead on the Senate version of the bill along with Sen. Roy Blunt, D-Mo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on getting that done before the end of the year,\" McConnell told reporters Wednesday.\n\nAs the #MeToo Movement continues to reverberate, Congress has yet to pass reform within its own chambers. Over the past year, several lawmakers have resigned due to allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nBoth the Senate and House have passed separate bills reforming the process of how sexual harassment is reported internally, but the differences between the two proposals have not yet been reconciled.\n\nBoth versions of the bill seek to make members of Congress personally liable if they're found guilty of sexual harassment or misconduct toward a staffer or another congressional employee. This provision was introduced after a report that over $342,000 in taxpayer funds was used to settle discrimination and harassment complaints involving members of the House from 2008 to 2012.\n\nThe House bill, passed in February, calls for each congressional office to adopt an anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policy.\n\n\u201cThere is no place for sexual harassment or any type of harassment, period,\" Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., chairman of the House Administration Committee, said before the House vote on the measure.\n\nThe Senate bill, passed in May, also would update rules around reporting sexual harassment, including one that forced victims to wait out a 30-day \"cooling off\" period before taking complaints to court.\n\n\"I think it puts the responsibility where the American people think it should be,\" Blunt said during the Senate vote on the bill.\n\nIn March, all 22 female senators wrote an open letter McConnell expressing disappointment that Congress has \"failed to enact meaningful reforms\" in regard to sexual harassment. USA TODAY previously reported that McConnell disagreed with the provision in the House bill that makes members financially liable for discrimination settlements.\n\nBut a spokesman countered that report, telling USA TODAY that McConnell \"supports members being personally, financially liable for sexual misconduct in which they have engaged.\"\n\nIf passed, the new rules regarding sexual harassment would be the first update to the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act, which applied workplace rules to Congress for the first time.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins, Nicole Gaudiano and Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/14/mitch-mcconnell-vows-congressional-action-sexual-harassment-reform/2001294002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Hue Jackson back with Bengals in unscripted coaching role", "description": "Former Bengals offensive coordinator Hue Jackson is back in town, though this time dabbling in the other side of the playbook.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Hue Jackson was talking to reporters outside Paul Brown Stadium when quarterback Andy Dalton yelled at him that practice was about to begin.\n\nJust like old times.\n\nThe former Bengals offensive coordinator is back in town, though this time dabbling in the other side of the playbook \u2014 well, mostly. How that part plays out is an interesting subplot as the Bengals (5-4) make one final push to save their at-risk season.\n\nAn unusual coaching arrangement for desperate times.\n\n\"It's a unique situation for a lot of us,\" linebacker Preston Brown said.\n\nA 51-14 loss to the Saints \u2014 the third straight game in which Cincinnati has given up 500 yards \u2014 set things in motion. Head coach Marvin Lewis fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday and installed himself in the dual role of coach and coordinator.\n\nHe also called his unemployed close friend to see if he was interested in returning for a third stint in Cincinnati as a special assistant on defense. Jackson was fired by the Browns two weeks earlier after winning three games in three seasons.\n\nJackson was hoping the Bengals would reach out to him.\n\n\"This is a tremendous opportunity for me, and I'm just thankful that they said, 'You come on home,'\" Jackson said.\n\nSo, now what?\n\nLewis built his coaching reputation as a defensive coordinator, directing the Ravens defense that won the Super Bowl in the 2000 season. He's decided to go back to his roots as a coordinator while also functioning as head coach \u2014 a challenge that few would undertake.\n\n\"There's a lot,\" Lewis said Wednesday.\n\nHe spent Tuesday night at home scripting defensive plays. He then led the team meeting on Wednesday morning and presided over the defensive meeting, simplifying things and pulling out a few plays from his past.\n\n\"He had a different PowerPoint,\" Brown said. \"He had a really small font, so it was kind of hard to take notes. But it was cool having him up there. You can tell he was having fun.\n\n\"We did a lot of things \u2014 old plays he was calling in 2015, '14, stuff I haven't seen yet. So he was bringing back some plays.\"\n\nLewis isn't sure how it will play out Sunday in Baltimore (4-5), a game the Bengals need to win to stay in the AFC North race. Jackson is providing input for the defensive game plan and will be on the sideline helping Lewis manage the defense, though their game-day roles haven't been defined.\n\nOne thing is clear: Jackson won't be dabbling in the offense. Not for now, anyway.\n\nAsked if Jackson would do anything with the offense, Lewis said emphatically, \"No. Separate from the offense.\"\n\nJackson was the Bengals' offensive coordinator when Dalton had his best season in 2015. He left to take Cleveland's head coaching job after the season. His return could create an awkward dynamic on the coaching staff.\n\nJackson said that offensive coordinator Bill Lazor came to his office at Paul Brown Stadium to greet him. Jackson said he'd be glad to offer an opinion if Lazor asks, but he's going to be careful not to trespass on other coaches' areas.\n\nHe knows that adding a newcomer midseason can work both ways.\n\n\"It can be impactful, but it can also hurt, too,\" Jackson said. \"And I get that. I just have to play my role, to the best of my ability. I don't want to do anything to upset anything that they have going on here. But at the same time if I can help, I do want to help.\"\n\nA DOZEN INJURED\n\nSeven players were held out of practice because of injuries Wednesday and five more were limited. The defense has been hit particularly hard.\n\nLB Preston Brown (knee), CB Dre Kirkpatrick (concussion), LB Nick Vigil (knee) and DT Adolphus Washington (knee) didn't practice. LB Vontaze Burfict (hip), CB Darqueze Dennard (shoulder) and LB Vincent Rey (groin) were limited.\n\nWR A.J. Green is out indefinitely with an injured toe. WR John Ross was limited because of a groin injury.\n\nSTADIUM UPDATE\n\nThe Bengals and Hamilton Country agreed in principle Wednesday on a plan to add parking and a music venue outside Paul Brown Stadium, and to repair and upgrade the 19-year-old stadium. The Bengals retain the right to build a cover over one of their adjacent practice fields, though they would have to pay for it. The team said there are no immediate plans to cover a field. The Bengals use the University of Cincinnati's covered field on wintry days.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThrough 10 weeks of the NFL season we now have a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of NFL teams and their defensive identities.\n\nWhile NFL head coaches game plan how to exploit these weaknesses, savvy fantasy owners do the same thing to gain an edge in daily fantasy tournaments.\n\nThere are four teams allowing 23-plus fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks through 10 weeks of the season and the gap from the fourth to the fifth place team is nearly as large as the gap from the fifth place to the 20th place team. New Orleans, Tampa Bay, Cincinnati and Atlanta have all emerged as defensive units that allow consistent production to opposing quarterbacks. The Saints are a particularly unique case as they have been a top 5 rush defense and funnel opponents toward the pass. The Eagles travel to New Orleans this week to play in the SuperDome, often referred to as \"The Coors Field of DFS\" due to the high-scoring matchups, just like what fantasy baseball players see from Colorado.\n\nCarson Wentz projects as a top QB option in a matchup where the Eagles have a 24-point team total and a need to throw if they're trailing. DailyRoto has Wentz projected for the highest passing yardage of any QB on the Week 11 main slates, expected to throw for 300-plus yards and two touchdowns with upside for more. The Saints defense has also allowed the most PPR points to opposing pass catchers and both Alshon Jeffrey and Zach Ertz can be paired comfortably with Wentz in tournaments. The duo has combined for 56 targets over the previous three weeks and should be in line for another strong workload. While it remains to be seen how quickly Golden Tate can pick up the Eagles offense, his emergence would hurt Nelson Agholor more than Jeffrey or Ertz.\n\nThe Raiders, Patriots, Bucs and Panthers all average double digit points allowed to opposing tight ends. With DFS pricing tighter, the highly variant tight end position has been a popular position to save salary. At just $2,900 on DraftKings, Arizona's Ricky Seals-Jones should provide value and salary relief for fantasy lineups. Since Byron Leftwich took over playcalling, Seals-Jones has drawn 13 targets in the last two games and finished with double digit fantasy points in Week 10. Betting on Seals-Jones is also a bet against the depth of the tight-end position as a whole, allowing daily players to spend up on high volume wideouts and running backs.\n\nAmong running backs, Ezekiel Elliott of Dallas also has value for tournaments against an Atlanta Falcons team that ranks as a bottom five defense against opposing RBs. Zeke is one of the true workhorse backs, seeing 90 percent of the Cowboys snaps at running back, virtually all of their RB carries and he also projecting for an 18 percent share of targets in Week 11. With high ownership going to Saquon Barkley, Melvin Gordon and Alvin Kamara, using Elliott could be a contrarian play that pays dividends.\n\n___\n\nFor more daily fantasy tools and advice, visit DailyRoto: https://dailyroto.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

So, under the most unusual of circumstances, \"Monday Night Football\" returns to Los Angeles for the first time in 33 years.\n\n\"We are disappointed that we are not going to be in Mexico City,\" Jay Rothman, the \"Monday Night Football\" producer, said Wednesday. \"We were really excited about the game when the schedule came out, we had it two years ago, we wanted it last year with New England and didn't get it, and this year we got it back.\n\n\"We understand the circumstance and just had to adjust. As difficult as the logistics are for both teams ... the same holds true for our crew. We had 150 people mobilizing.\n\n\"Our fleet of trucks left Santa Clara and were to be at the Mexican border this morning. It turned into a scramble mode for much of our team.\n\n\"Now, 'Monday Night Football' returns to LA for the first time since 1985, and we are excited about that.\"\n\nESPN was not consulted by the league about changing the locale of the game, but was notified by the NFL that it was a possibility.

(AP Photo/David Kent) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Joey Logano is the outlier in this year's championship race. He was never in the mix for this year's Cup title, not until he used his bumper to move reigning champion Martin Truex Jr. out of his way to forcefully snag a spot in NASCAR's version of the final four.\n\nThe move aggravated Truex, who vowed not to allow Logano to win the title . \"He may have won the battle,\" Truex fumed, \"but he ain't winning the damn war.\"\n\nA week later, Aric Almirola made a similar promise because he was rankled Logano refused to cut him any slack on the track.\n\nTime and again, Logano finds himself in the center of a high-profile spat.\n\nA decade of dealing with these silly little slights, being pushed around on and off the track, has taught Logano how to tune it out. He goes into Sunday's winner-take-all season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway convinced he's finally going to win his first Cup title.\n\nLogano will race Truex, Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch for the championship.\n\n\"I said 15 weeks ago we were an underdog and I would be surprised if we made it to the final four,\" Logano said. \"Now I feel like we are the favorites to win this thing. It's crazy how things change.\"\n\nHe feels as if he's the favorite, but Logano is clearly the underdog of this group. His No. 22 Team Penske group was mediocre most of the season and an afterthought to the so-called Big Three of Busch, Harvick and Truex, a trio of former series champions who dominated the regular season.\n\nBut Logano mastered a path through the playoffs and could pull off the upset of his career.\n\nIt would be vindication for the driver tagged as NASCAR's next superstar by Hall of Famer Mark Martin when Logano was just a teen waiting to turn 18 and be eligible to race at NASCAR's national level. He was nicknamed \"Sliced Bread,\" because he was allegedly \"the best thing since,\" and the expectations were enormous by the time he made his debut.\n\nLogano is by nature happy-go-lucky, and when he made it to the big leagues, his parents traveled the circuit with him. That became a bone of contention among Logano's peers, who resented his clean path into NASCAR and found him an easy target for scuffles on and off the track.\n\nThen he was pushed into the Cup Series way ahead of schedule because Joe Gibbs Racing, the team that groomed him, had an unexpected opening. It made Logano a target for everyone from Tony Stewart, Kevin Harvick, Denny Hamlin, Matt Kenseth and other high-profile drivers.\n\nDrama after drama would have broken some, but Logano has rebounded every time.\n\nWhen Gibbs could no longer wait for him to produce, he landed with Team Penske and has won 18 races since moving teams. He's qualified for NASCAR's championship round in three of the last five seasons, and was the favorite to win the title in 2015 but a feud with Matt Kenseth led to Kenseth wrecking Logano out of an automatic berth into the finale.\n\nHe was in a spectacular crash racing Carl Edwards for the victory the next year, and a penalty kept the No. 22 team out of the playoffs last season. Logano was the first driver locked into the finale this year, despite just one regular-season victory and not showing his Ford could keep up with the Big Three.\n\nHe earned his berth win a victory at Martinsville Speedway, where he moved Truex out of his way in the final turn to grab the ticket to Homestead. Truex was furious with the move, but Logano was adamant he had to take that opportunity and couldn't risk not going for broke.\n\nLogano was booed as he took the checkered flag.\n\n\"I love his passion. The one thing you've got to appreciate out of Joey is that he races, he gives 100 percent,\" said Logano crew chief Todd Gordon. \"He's racing all the time, and that's a great attribute of his. He's up on it. You never have to question where we are, if it's through practice or through any session, you're getting 100 percent out of him.\"\n\nLogano backed up his right to be aggressive with Truex and Almirola in last weekend's penultimate playoff race at Phoenix. A flat tire caused him to crash out early. If Logano hadn't won Martinsville, the Phoenix crash would have prevented him from making the finale. So he paid no mind to Truex's anger, and even less to Almirola's assentation that Logano should have cut other playoff drivers some slack because Logano had nothing on the line once he was locked into Homestead.\n\n\"Our sport was built on tough racing and I'm going to race hard,\" Logano said. \"I'm a racer. That's what I am. I've got one gear when I get in a race car ... it's to go win the race. To be a good race car driver, a lot of times you have to be selfish, you've got to think about what's best for your race team and I think that's kind of the approach I've taken over the years.\n\n\"Once I started racing that way, I've won a lot more races.\"\n\nHe also had to deal with the ire of some of his rivals, namely Kenseth in 2015. He and Kenseth had tangled on the track various times in that season, when Logano won six races, including three straight in the playoffs. One of those wins was at Kansas and Logano didn't need it to advance into the next round and the victory came at Kenseth's expense.\n\nLogano was unapologetic, made no effort to make peace with Kenseth, and Kenseth retaliated two weeks later by preventing Logano from winning at Martinsville Speedway to earn an automatic berth into the championship. Logano didn't recover and missed the final four.\n\nAll of those altercations \"make you tough as nails,\" Logano said, but also matured him into the driver he is now. The problems with Kenseth were a career-changer in that Logano now understands politics in racing stretch off the track and into the motorhome lot.\n\n\"I've learned how to handle situations,\" he said. \"You've got to go through things to learn things sometimes and you just have to learn things the hard way. It's not the fun way to learn things the hard way, but you do and not only does that help you on the race track, but for the rest of my life I'll be able to take those lessons with me.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It is rather like \u2013 to use an an analogy I am certain will find favor \u2013 planting a tree and being able to watch it grow.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Over his 70 years, Philip and I have seen Charles become a champion of conservation and the arts, a great charitable leader \u2013 a dedicated and respected heir to the throne to stand comparison with any in history \u2013 and a wonderful father.\"\n\nIn a symbol of just how much things have changed in the last 20 years, Queen Elizabeth also gave credit to his second wife, Duchess Camilla, calling her the one who \"sustains\" him.\n\nThe queen did get in one joke, courtesy of the Queen Mother, who died in 2002.\n\n\"My mother saw me turn 70, of course,\" she shared. \"And she was heard to observe that 70 is exactly the age when the number of candles on your cake finally exceeds the amount of breath you have to blow them out.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Charles made his own joke about the milestone at a tea with other new septugenarians.\n\n\"It's rather like indigestion,\" he said. \" 'Many Happy Returns' are not quite the same as you get older.\"\n\nPrince Charles of Wales poses for an official portrait to mark his 70th birthday in the gardens of Clarence House, with members of the royal family.

The system automatically pushes the nose of the plane down.\n\nBut if that nose-down command is triggered by faulty sensor readings \u2014 as suspected in the Lion Air crash \u2014 pilots can struggle to control the plane, which can go into a dive and perhaps crash, according to a Boeing safety bulletin and safety regulators.\n\nThe bulletin included new details on how to stop a runaway series of events from leading to a crash, pilots say.\n\n\"It is something we did not have before in any of our training. It wasn't in our books. American didn't have it,\" said Dennis Tajer, a 737 pilot and spokesman for the pilots union at American Airlines. \"Now I have to wonder what else is there?\"\n\nJon Weaks, a 737 captain and president of the pilots union at Southwest, said he couldn't recall a similar omission in a Boeing operating manual.\n\n\"I was not pleased. How could something like this happen? We want to be given the information to keep our pilots, our passengers and our families safe,\" he said.\n\nWeaks said he is satisfied that \"we have been given, finally, the correct information.\"\n\nThe Max is the newest version of the twin-engine Boeing 737. More than 200 have been delivered to airlines worldwide, including American, Southwest and United.\n\nBoeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Tuesday that the Chicago-based company remains confident the Max is a safe airplane. He said Boeing did not withhold operating details from airlines and flight crews.\n\n\"We ensure that we provide all of the information that is needed to safely fly our airplanes,\" Muilenburg told Fox Business Network. He said Boeing bulletins to airlines and pilots \"point them back to existing flight procedures\" to handle the kind of sensor problem suspected in last month's crash.\n\nA Southwest spokeswoman said the new automated maneuvering system was not included in the operating manual for Max models. An American spokesman said the airline was unaware of some new automated functions in the Max but hasn't experienced nose-direction errors. A United spokesman said Boeing and the FAA do not believe additional pilot training is needed.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency directive last week to airlines, telling them to update cockpit manuals to include instructions for how pilots can adjust flight controls under certain conditions.\n\n\"The FAA will take further action if findings from the accident investigation warrant,\" the agency said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nOn Oct. 29, Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta. All 189 people on board were killed.\n\nJohn Cox, a former 737 pilot and now a safety consultant to airlines, said Boeing's steps since the crash \"have been exactly correct. They have increased pilot awareness, they have reminded them of the proper procedure to disable (the automatic nose-down action), which stops the problem.\"\n\nIndonesian investigators say that the Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 experienced malfunctions with sensors that indicate the angle of the nose on four recent flights, including the fatal one.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. and Indonesian investigators are increasingly focusing on the way that the plane's automated control systems interact. They are also questioning whether the FAA and Boeing adequately analyzed potential hazards if the systems malfunction and send faulty data to the plane's computers, according to the newspaper.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2018/11/14/pilots-says-boeing-didnt-disclose-new-control-feature-737-max/2001713002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "This Oklahoma City will pay you $10,000 to relocate", "description": "Tulsa, Oklahoma will pay you to relocate.

All 8 pounds of her have made me a better parent to my three daughters.\n\nEvery few days one of my kids will ask, \u201cDo you love Chloe more than you love me?\u201d\n\nOr some variation like, \u201cIf the house was on fire and you could only save one of us or the dog, who would you choose?\u201d\n\nWe first spotted Chloe zipping around a front yard, tossing an empty yogurt cup in the air before attacking it with fury. She was a long-haired Chihuahua mix and the last of the litter. My husband and I still marvel at that today in the mushy voices reserved for dogs and babies. \u201cWhy last? You\u2019re the cutest, most special, most beautiful, most goo-goo-eyed good girl in the whole world.\u201d The owner of the puppies must have shielded Chloe \u2013 her favorite \u2013 from the public until no more puppies remained. That\u2019s how we explain that.\n\nWe drove home with Chloe in my lap, her chin resting on the yogurt cup between her paws. She was to be my 8-year-old's birthday present.\n\nBut it was clear to everyone: Chloe was mine.\n\nShe follows me from room to room. She greets me with the joyful relief of a reunited family when I return home. When I\u2019m napping and a kid disturbs me, she brings the same fury to them that she did that yogurt cup.\n\nRight to be suspicious\n\nMy kids have their reasons for asking who I love more. Consider:\n\nI say hello to Chloe first when I come home. But only because she\u2019s there waiting. My girls may not be bothered to look up from their electronic devices.\n\nBut only because she\u2019s there waiting. My girls may not be bothered to look up from their electronic devices. I labor over her snacks at the supermarket. Will she like this one? And didn\u2019t my dental hygienist say these snacks were bad for dogs? The kids get Goldfish, some fruit and I\u2019m done.\n\nWill she like this one? And didn\u2019t my dental hygienist say these snacks were bad for dogs? The kids get Goldfish, some fruit and I\u2019m done. I take A LOT of photos and videos of Chloe. She\u2019s a better subject than my kids. The girls stick out their tongues or snatch the iPhone from me and erase the most adorable pictures for fear it will ruin their street cred.\n\nAnd why shouldn\u2019t I lavish some extra attention on her? Unlike my kids, Chloe:\n\nComes when I call, tail wagging. My kids claim they fail to hear me. Every time.\n\ntail wagging. My kids claim they fail to hear me. Every time. Never says this is yucky at dinner. (At least not audibly.)\n\n(At least not audibly.) Gets in the car right when I say it's time to go. She doesn\u2019t complain that wherever we are going is boring. She doesn\u2019t make a rolling garbage can out of my car. She doesn't make rude comments about my choice of music.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t complain that wherever we are going is boring. She doesn\u2019t make a rolling garbage can out of my car. She doesn't make rude comments about my choice of music. Only whines when it\u2019s been too long since she\u2019s been outside or we fail to share our popcorn. My kids whine when we\u2019re out of their favorite cereal, their favorite school uniform skirt isn\u2019t hanging where they expect or another kid changed the TV channel.\n\nLittle dog, big impact\n\nHere\u2019s the unexpected thing about being a dog owner: All 8 pounds of her have made me a better parent. Let me count the ways ...\n\n1. I am more chill.\n\nI have bouts of teeth-grinding anxiety. But when she\u2019s beside me and I stroke her fur, it disappears. The anxiety slips away \u2013 subtly and without labor, unlike the deep breathing I practice. She\u2019s instant Prozac without the side effects. Happy mom, happy children.\n\n2. I check myself before I wreck myself.\n\nChloe doesn't like loud dissension in the house. Like most chihuahuas, she has the tremble factor. When I'm screeching at the kids that the living room looks like a wild frat party and I see Chloe shaking under the table, I bring it down a notch. Or two.\n\n3. I practice pack love.\n\nBeing near is enough.\n\nWhen the kids want me to watch some TV show with stupid parents, condescending kids and jokes I see coming from a mile away, I don't want to. But I do. Because Chloe demonstrates that being near your peeps is pack love, and it's important.\n\n4. I take breaks more often.\n\nIf I've been toiling away too long, usually on the computer, Chloe will offer a low growl. This means get up and do something else. She doesn't care that it has anything to do with her, but she, too, has been in the same spot for too long. That's good for me, but also my kids because after the break I'm reset. I'm out of my head and may actually be able to pay attention when one of my children is speaking.\n\n5. I forgive and forget. Faster.\n\nI can think of no finer example of how to practice forgiveness than my dog. Step on her tail, she yelps and is over it. She even licks your toes to let you know it\u2019s OK and she\u2019s sorry if she did anything to cause it. Think that doesn\u2019t translate into practicing fast forgiveness with your kids? You\u2019d be wrong because the buoyancy of being let off the hook for a wrong is so liberating that I want to pay it forward. Even to the kid who has kicked over the milk glass she put on the carpet for the upteenth time.\n\nDo I love her more?\n\nSo when the children ask, do you love Chloe more than you love us, I immediately say no. OK. Maybe first I like to watch them squirm a little.\n\nI don't love Chloe more. But I am, since she came into my life two years ago, definitely able to love you, dear children, better.\n\nLike All the Moms?

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Back with the United States for only the second time in an injury-troubled year, Christian Pulisic has watched the Americans rebuild from afar after their failure to qualify for the World Cup.\n\n\"I definitely need to be a more important piece of this team and continue to grow as a leader,\" the 20-year-old midfielder said ahead of Thursday's friendly against England. \"It's tough because I'm not a very vocal guy, not super outgoing. But I think the biggest thing I can do is lead by example. I want to show these guys how it's done on a professional level.\"\n\nPulisic is talking like a veteran and yet only debuted in March 2016. The Hershey, Pennsylvania, native has 21 appearances and nine goals, the last in the 2-1 loss at Trinidad and Tobago in October 2017 that ended the American's streak of seven straight World Cups. Pulisic's only appearance since has been in a friendly against Bolivia in May.\n\nHis focus has been getting playing time at Borussia Dortmund, a task frustrated by injuries. Pulisic didn't even make the bench Saturday when Dortmund beat Bundesliga champion Bayern Munich 3-2 to stay atop the standings. Pulisic confirmed he was \"100 percent\" fit last weekend.\n\n\"It's tough. I had some injuries going on and off, and I got some games that I missed out,\" Pulisic he said Wednesday. \"We have a great team this year. I want to be on the field just like everyone else does.\"\n\nPulisic inherited Landon Donovan's No. 10 jersey and his importance to the U.S. team.\n\nThe burden of pressure, too, at a young age, much like Wayne Rooney experienced with England. Now 33 and finishing his career in Major League Soccer, the D.C. United striker is making a one-off England return after a two-year absence and will make his 120th appearances.\n\n\"I can definitely look up to a guy like that,\" Pulisic said of Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion with Manchester United.\n\nRooney was part of an England \"golden generation\" that failed to live up to the hype. With a more low-key approach and most players unscarred by past setbacks, England in July unexpectedly reached its first World Cup semifinal in 28 years.\n\n\"It's an inspiration for us,\" Pulisic said. \"We definitely feel that with the young side that we can we can also do something like that. That's the goal for us.\"\n\nPulisic has spoken with new U.S. team general manager Earnie Stewart, who says he will hire the next U.S. coach later this year, putting the new regime in place ahead of next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup. After that will be qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and Pulisic figures to be in the prime of his career when the U.S. co-hosts the 2026 tournament with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe American midfield of the future could be on the field together for the first time at Wembley: Pulisic, 19-year-old Tyler Adams and 20-year-old Weston McKennie, perhaps joined by Tim Weah, the 18-year-old son of former FIFA Player of the Year \u2014 and current Liberia president \u2014 George Weah.\n\n\"We have a lot of brave young players and guys who aren't afraid to come in and show us what they know about the game,\" Pulisic said. \"Guys can't come in to be shy and expect us to kind of show them the ropes. They've got to come in and they've got to show what they can do it and be competent with it.\"\n\nPulisic is friends with McKennie, also based in Germany. Adams is expected to move there, too, this winter, leaving MLS's New York Red Bulls for sister club RB Leipzig.\n\n\"We want to help out the young guys ... as much as we can,\" Pulisic said. \"We also still have a lot to learn.\"\n\nPlaying in Germany helps.\n\n\"The Bundesliga has been a great platform,\" Pulisic said. \"They trust their young players, and Dortmund has been an unbelievable start to my career.\"\n\nInevitably when visiting England, talk will turn to whether Pulisic envisages a move to the Premier League. His Dortmund contract ends in 2020.\n\n\"I'm still enjoying every moment of it,\" he said. \"When the time comes, that's when I have my talks my Dortmund and see what I want to do moving forward.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Todd Plitt, USA TODAY)\n\nElie Wiesel is best known as a Holocaust survivor and a writer whose works, such as \"Night,\" called attention to the importance of remembrance and the need to prevent further inhumanity.\n\nBut while the Nobel Peace Prize winner - who died in 2016 at age 87 - taught millions of people around the globe lessons of faith and activism, many forget he was a professional educator, too.\n\nFor decades, he taught at Boston University, where his courses were among the most popular on campus.\n\nA new book chronicles those lectures and classroom interactions. Witness: Lessons from Elie Wiesel's Classroom (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 259 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of four) is by Ariel Burger, who met the master writer when he was 15, studied under him in his 20s and served as his teaching assistant in his 30s.\n\nBurger transports the reader to those salons of learning on the Charles River, where Wiesel's students over the years ranged from the granddaughter of a Nazi SS officer to a Korean minister in training.\n\nUnlike the best-selling \"Tuesdays with Morrie\" \u2013 which highlighted author Mitch Albom's relationship with another Boston-area professor \u2013 Burger's book has a protagonist who was already world-famous.\n\n\"Witness: Lessons From Elie Wiesel's Classroom' (Photo: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)\n\nWitness does have a Wednesdays-with-Wiesel feel. Burger intersperses bits of his own life and background as he shares an album's worth of snapshots from Wiesel's time at BU. Burger's tone and execution are exactly what his title promises \u2013 and in keeping with the way Wiesel lived his life.\n\nHere are three lessons for those who never sat in a classroom with Wiesel:\n\n1. Why faith remains after horror.\n\nWiesel's book Night is part of the canon not only of Holocaust writing, but American literature. According to Burger, Wiesel rarely taught his most famous volume, but he made an exception for the 2006 fall semester at the request of students. (That was the year Oprah Winfrey selected \"Night,\" an autobiographical account of his family's deportation by the Nazis to the Auschwitz death camp and then Buchenwald, for her book club.)\n\nTheology and suffering were among the topics addressed.\n\n\"I believe in a wounded faith. Only a wounded faith can exist after those events,\" he told his class, adding, \"(W)e cannot conceive of that place with God or without God. It is impossible to pray. But I did, and I said that prayer, because my father said it, his father, his grandfather. How could I be the last?\"\n\n2. It's essential to fight hate.\n\nWiesel lived a history he never wanted to see repeated. He assembled activists and thinkers in conferences called \"Anatomy of Hate\" to explore why, decades after the Holocaust, people continued to annihilate those different from themselves.\n\nAuthor Ariel Burger. (Photo: Maor Ziv-Kreger)\n\n\"When you face evil, don't let it grow, fight it right away,\" he said. \"Anyone who is suffering, anyone who is threatened becomes your responsibility...It is not the end \u2013 I do not know how to end hatred, I truly wish I did \u2013 but recognizing our shared humanity is a good beginning.\"\n\n3. The power of words, for good and evil.\n\nBurger, like his mentor, knows that the 26 letters in the alphabet, arranged into endless combinations of thoughts, can effect change \u2013 or destroy.\n\n\"Language is essential. It is more than a vehicle to transmit ideas or memories; it is a desire of the human being to transcend his own limits,\" Wiesel told students. \"But language can be corrupted. It can be contaminated by human cruelty.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2018/11/14/elie-wiesels-classroom-lessons-holocaust-book-witness-ariel-burger-book-review/1897795002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Sean Fujiwara, USA TODAY", "title": "The best Cyber Monday deals", "description": "With Black Friday behind us, it's time to look out for Cyber Monday deals.

Terrill, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The best NBA team in Los Angeles right now isn't the one with LeBron James.\n\nIt's the no-name Clippers.\n\nGoing into Wednesday, the Clippers were fourth in the rugged Western Conference at 8-5, with overtime wins against defending NBA champion Golden State and Milwaukee, as well as Oklahoma City and Houston (twice).\n\n\"We're going to keep on getting better,\" leading scorer Tobias Harris said. \"We've showed we can play with the best of them.\"\n\nWhile they don't have talent on par with those teams, the Clippers are transitioning to a new era with a mix of veterans like Danilo Gallinari, Harris, Marcin Gortat and Patrick Beverley. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has cracked the starting lineup as a rookie point guard. Montrezl Harrell brings a contagious energy off the bench.\n\nIn a win over Washington, they had a franchise-record nine players score in double figures.\n\n\"They seem to all have a chip on their shoulder because a lot of those guys are really good players but they might not get the publicity that other guys get,\" Warriors guard Klay Thompson said. \"They might not have a star player but they have a lot of guys who fill their roles really well.\"\n\nWith Hall of Famer Jerry West as a consultant, the Clippers added proven veteran support in Gortat, Mike Scott and 7-foot-3 Boban Marjanovic, a fan favorite.\n\nLou Williams, last season's Sixth Man of the Year, can score 20 points in a given night off the bench.\n\n\"I know it's a name game, but we feel like we're a pretty good basketball team,\" he said. \"It's the most level-headed team I've been on. We don't have a lot of ego.\"\n\nThe names that led to the team's Lob City nickname have moved on. DeAndre Jordan left for Dallas as a free agent last summer, Blake Griffin went to Detroit in a stunning February trade, and Chris Paul headed to Houston last year.\n\nWith them went a lot of the drama that had surrounded the team in recent years.\n\n\"We're just fun to watch. We play together, not a lot of bickering,\" coach Doc Rivers said. \"It really is a joy to coach these guys. The Lakers have LeBron James. They should get a lot of attention. If we couldn't get that, we wanted toughness.\"\n\nThey've got it in Harrell, who ran up and jawed in Derrick Rose's face during a win over Minnesota. Gilgeous-Alexander blocked a shot by Warriors All-Star Draymond Green and fearlessly drove at him in the paint.\n\nWhat they desperately need this season is good health.\n\nInjuries sidelined many of the veterans last season, notably Gallinari, Beverley and Avery Bradley, but the Clippers stayed in the playoff hunt until the final week of the season while relying on unproven players like Sindarius Thornwell and Tyrone Wallace. They just missed a playoff berth despite going 42-40 for their franchise-record seventh straight winning season.\n\nSo far the injuries have been minor, with Bradley nursing a left ankle sprain and Luc Mbah a Moute out with a sore left knee.\n\nThe team has bought into Rivers' style of play, which is different than when Jordan, Griffin and Paul dominated the minutes.\n\n\"It's a team. Nobody is about self or one person,\" Harrell said. \"There's no telling who is going to have a big night. The name of the game is to win.\"\n\nNot just now but next summer, too.\n\nThat's when the team will have significant spending power under the salary cap with enough money to try to lure two maximum-salaried players. They may look to add a star before the trade deadline using players like Harris, Gortat, Scott, Marjanovic and Mbah a Moute, who are all in the final years of their contracts, as trade bait.\n\nUntil then, the Clippers will work to survive in the loaded West with a bunch of names you can't tell without a roster sheet.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The year's going well, but I feel like there's another level I can take it to for my teammates.\"\n\nSacks aren't the only category where ACC players are making their presence felt.\n\nBoston College's Hamp Cheevers is tied for first with six interceptions and leads a three-man ACC contingent in the top five. Virginia's Juan Thornhill and Syracuse's Andre Cisco are tied for third with five picks each.\n\nThe conference also has a significant presence in tackles for loss with five in the top 25 nationally. Two are at Miami: Senior Gerald Willis III (17) is tied for eighth and sophomore Jonathan Garvin (14.5) is tied for 18th. Syracuse junior Alton Robinson is tied for 15th with 15 while Burns, Ferrell and Boston College's Zach Allen are tied for 23rd with 13.5.\n\nIt doesn't stop there.\n\nVirginia cornerback Bryce Hall leads the nation with 19 passes defended and has intercepted two. North Carolina's Malik Carney and Pittsburgh's Dane Jackson are tied for third in fumbles forced with four each. North Carolina's Cole Holcomb (93 tackles) and N.C. State's Germaine Pratt (91) rank 32nd and 38th respectively in that category.\n\nHaving defensive difference-makers has helped Syracuse (8-2) to the No. 12 ranking in the Top 25 \u2014 its highest since September 1998 \u2014 while BC (7-3) is 22nd.\n\nHall jokes that Thornhill steals his interceptions, but adds that it's because his fellow Cavalier is all over the field.\n\n\"Ultimately, he's a playmaker,\" Hall said of Thornhill. \"I like his game because anywhere you stick him on the defense, he's going to make plays and that just shows how smart he is.\"\n\nThere's no underestimating the value coaches place on a player with a keen instinct for the ball, such as the Seminoles' Burns.\n\n\"He's smart, first of all,\" Florida State defensive coordinator Harlon Barnett Barnett said. \"A smart football player allows you to be an even better football player on all levels. If you have a great understanding of your opponent \u2014 the guy across from you and the scheme \u2014 and understanding certain situations (where) they like to do this and certain situations they like to do that. ... Now, your game can go to another level.\n\n\"He's a great example of that.\"\n\nThat type of play can also make teammates better. BC is a great example of that.\n\nThe Eagles' Ray has definitely thrived playing on the opposite end of Allen, who was the nation's only lineman with 100 tackles last season. Boston College coach Steve Addazio cites Allen as his biggest playmaker and praises Cheevers and Ray for making clutch plays, but notes that everybody's capable of contributing on an opportunistic unit.\n\n\"Those two guys have done a good job with (interceptions) and sacks, and both are athletic guys and experienced guys,\" he said. \"But we have a number of those guys on our defense right now.\"\n\nClemson continues to set the defensive standard as it seeks a fourth consecutive ACC championship and second national title in three seasons.\n\nThe Tigers are tied for No. 1 nationally in scoring defense at 12.7 points per game and ranks second in yardage allowed at 253.6 yards per game. Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables stresses to players the importance of putting the team first, but said it's not a hard sell.\n\n\"It's been a selfless group,\" Venables said, \"and as a result, there's been incredible success.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Jimmy Golen in Boston; Pete Iacobelli in Clemson, South Carolina; John Kekis in Syracuse, New York; Hank Kurz in Charlottesville, Virginia; and freelancer Bob Ferrante in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Puskar, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Jim Rutherford celebrated a new contract in the most expected of ways: by putting together a trade he hopes will jump-start his struggling team.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins general manager signed a contract extension on Wednesday that will keep him with the club through the 2021-22 season. Moments later he dealt forward Carl Hagelin to the Los Angeles Kings for forward Tanner Pearson.\n\nAll of it unfolded as Penguins captain Sidney Crosby skipped practice while being evaluated for an upper-body injury. Just another busy day for the 69-year-old Rutherford.\n\nThe only general manager to win Stanley Cups with multiple teams in the expansion era remains fervently committed to his job, which is why he didn't hesitate to make a trade that sent the speedy but slumping Hagelin to the Kings for the younger Pearson, the first of what could be several moves as Pittsburgh tries to shake itself out of a 7-6-3 start.\n\n\"Despite the fact it hasn't been a happy couple of weeks with the Penguins as a whole, I'm very happy to be staying and will do my best to fix it,\" Rutherford said.\n\nThe Penguins hired Rutherford in the summer of 2014 to replace Ray Shero. Under his guidance, the Penguins revamped their roster and their coaching staff, surrounding Crosby and Evgeni Malkin with a talented group that helped Pittsburgh become the first franchise in nearly 20 years to win consecutive Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017.\n\nHagelin scored the empty-net goal that clinched the 2017 Cup, racing down the ice in the final seconds of Game 6 to set off a giddy celebration on the bench. Yet Hagelin's production dipped last year. He finished with just 10 goals \u2014 the fewest in his career in a season in which he played at least 65 games \u2014 and had just one goal this year before the trade was announced.\n\n\"I feel bad,\" Rutherford said. \"Carl Hagelin is a very popular guy and I like him a lot personally ... at the same time we're not tracking toward winning a Stanley Cup right now and changes are necessary.\"\n\nHagelin is in the final season of a contract that pays him $4 million annually. Pearson, 26, has two more seasons left on his deal that is worth around $3.75 million per year. Pearson has averaged 40 points in each of the past three seasons, but had just one point \u2014 an assist \u2014 in 17 games with the Kings this season. He could be available as early as Thursday night when the Penguins host Tampa Bay.\n\n\"He's shown an ability to produce offensively ... he's a decent skater ... he's got a good 200-foot game,\" Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. \"We'll see where we slot him here over the next little while.\"\n\nThe Penguins could certainly use a boost. They have dropped five of six, the longest extended slide of Rutherford's largely successful four-plus year tenure. The man nicknamed \"Trader Jim\" for his aggressive approach to addressing problems insists he still has plenty of juice left to keep going even as his 70th birthday approaches in February. It's a far cry from the day he was hired when he said he anticipated working a few more seasons.\n\n\"I said at the time I'd probably be around a couple years,\" Rutherford said. \"I guess I went a couple years at a time. Two times two and we're still counting. You never know.\"\n\nFor now his attention is focused on helping the star-laden Penguins emerge from another early malaise.\n\nCrosby played more than 21 minutes and didn't miss a shift during Tuesday night's 4-2 loss to New Jersey. His absence at practice on Wednesday was a surprise, though Sullivan offered few details. It doesn't appear to be a long-term problem, however, though Pittsburgh's issues are far larger than just health. They are having trouble preventing goals and the offense for once isn't picking up the slack.\n\n\"I just think we're in a funk now, we're a fragile team,\" Rutherford said. \"We're struggling but for the most part I still believe in this team. ... Everybody wants to win a championship and I believe we still can.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Data from a worldwide array of telescopes have revealed this frozen, dimly lit world. (Photo: ESO/M. Kornmesser)\n\nThe planet lies well beyond the star's habitable zone in which liquid water, and possibly life, could exist.\n\nIt's a barren, frigid world because light from Barnard's Star provides it with only 2 percent of the energy the Earth receives from the sun.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely exciting new planet candidate,\u201d Sarah Ballard, an MIT scientist not involved with the research, told Sky and Telescope. She cautioned that \"I wouldn't buy a ticket to Barnard's Star just yet, knowing that there's a 1 percent chance the planet isn't there.\u201d\n\nThe star's nearby status has made it a long-running candidate in the hunt for exoplanets. None of the previous searches led to a discovery.\n\n\"This remarkable planet gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution,\" Rodrigo D\u00edaz, an astronomer at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, said in an article accompanying the study.\n\nThe study was published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature.\n\nThe distances to the nearest stars from the sun.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNAPLES, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Ariya Jutanugarn is occasionally fearful on the golf course, which might seem peculiar given her resume.\n\nShe's already clinched the LPGA's player of the year award, her second in the last three seasons. She's already clinched the money title, also for the second time in three years. She's back to No. 1 in the world rankings, will almost certainly have the lowest scoring average on tour this year and finished in the top 10 more regularly than any of her fellow competitors.\n\nIf all that wasn't enough, she has the best chance this week at the season-ending tour championship that starts Thursday at Tiburon Golf Club of capturing the Race to the CME Globe \u2014 which comes with a $1 million bonus.\n\nSo still playing scared at times, that's a puzzler.\n\n\"I just want to improve myself every day,\" Jutanugarn said. \"I know I have so much room (to) improve. ... Every time when I go out and play I always have some different situation. Sometimes I worry. Sometimes I'm scared. Sometimes I feel so confident to play golf.\"\n\nThe confident moments seem like they override the worrisome and fearful ones.\n\nShe got hot at the right time in 2018 \u2014 winning twice in May, the second of those being the U.S. Women's Open, then grabbing the Scottish Open victory in July. She's been tied for third or better in three of her last four starts, and went 67-67 on the weekend to prevail at the tour championship on this southwest Florida track last year.\n\nJutanugarn won't carry a driver this week \u2014 she's 122nd this season in driving accuracy \u2014 but she seems to rarely have trouble scoring. She leads the LPGA in birdies, is third in putting average and is even 13th in driving distance despite her disdain for using what ordinarily is the biggest club in the bag.\n\n\"I want to play well, I want to hit this shot good because I care about other people, what they're going to be thinking about me,\" Jutanugarn said. \"But then I have to come back to myself and know that other people's expectation is not my expectation. I have to know what is my expectation, because I expect to have a good commitment with every shot. I expect myself to have fun, enjoy, and feel free on the course.\"\n\nShe's one of five women in the field who have the simplest path to winning the CME Globe: Win the tournament, and the trophy and bonus are theirs. Minjee Lee, Brooke Henderson, Nasa Hataoka and Sung Hyun Park are the others; five who are assured of winning the Globe if they win the tournament. There are seven other women with a mathematical chance,\n\n\"One of my main goals this year was to be in the top five coming into this event so that I could have this opportunity,\" Henderson said. \"I've been really fortunate that for the past three years I've been in position if I play well this week that I could walk away with that $1 million, which is pretty special. I think it all comes down to you need to have a really great week.\"\n\nIt's the third consecutive year where Henderson has come to Naples \u2014 she's Canadian, but now has a home about 30 minutes away from Tiburon \u2014 with a chance to win the Globe and the bonus money.\n\nShe still doesn't know what she'd do if she won the extra $1 million.\n\n\"I've been asked that the last three years, and I'm still not really sure,\" Henderson said. \"But just the opportunity to be here, I'm really grateful. Hopefully I can do something special this week.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Mortensen struggled to finish his plate. \u201cAnd then they\u2019re looking at me like, 'He doesn\u2019t like it.' ... 'No, no! It\u2019s great!\u2019 \u201d\n\nTony Lip (Viggo Mortensen, left) gets advice in writing long-distance love letters to his wife from Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) in \"Green Book.\" (Photo: UNIVERSAL PICTURES)\n\nAfterward, \u201cI made a good show of going out to my rental car and getting in it, and I just drove around the corner and parked, cranked the seat back, undid my belt and laid there for an hour,\u201d he says with a grin.\n\n\"Green Book,\" a flip on \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" is based on a true story and doesn't cut corners: The film shows the blue-collar Tony hurling epithets common to the period \u2013 a contrast to the reserved, regal pianist he drives \u2013 and touches on police brutality. (While discussing the era at a recent Q&A for the film, Mortensen invoked a racial slur in describing what\u2019s no longer permissible, for which he has since apologized.)\n\nBut the movie, which is largely a road comedy, also is based on a real travel guide. The Green Book, which began publication in the 1930s, was a pamphlet that mapped where African-Americans could find safe lodging across the country. Before filming, the cast thumbed through old copies.\n\nCLOSE Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen's characters come from two different social worlds, but the common ground they find in \"Green Book\" can speak to us all. USA TODAY\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty straightforward,\" Mortensen says. \"And they\u2019re not that thick, because obviously the farther South you get, there\u2019s not that many places they could stay.\u201d\n\nAli compares a 1960s-era AAA travel guide to a Green Book: \"One is saying, 'Explore America! This is how you come see Niagara Falls or the Grand Canyon or the Alamo!' ... And the other one is telling you, as a black person, 'This is how you survive when you get there and not die.'\n\n\"What year can you point to and say that's when the mentality changed? That this was all open to all of us?\" asks Ali, who signed on to \"Green Book\" shortly after winning his first Oscar for \"Moonlight\" in 2017.\n\nAs Tony and Doc Shirley drive farther South, where the classically trained musician's wealthy, white audience throws open their salon doors but won\u2019t let him use their bathrooms, a deeper appreciation of each other grows. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a movie about the limitations of first impressions,\u201d Mortensen says.\n\nTony Lip (Viggo Mortensen, right) is driver, confidante and security for famous pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a 1962 concert tour of the South in the comedy-drama \"Green Book.\" (Photo: UNIVERSAL PICTURES)\n\nPrognosticators are paving a road to Oscar for \"Green Book,\u201d which boasts a 92% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film quietly entered the Toronto International Film Festival in September, emerging with the festival\u2019s top prize. Now the film is predicted to be a top contender for the best-picture Oscar.\n\nThe reaction at that first screening shocked even those who made \"Green Book.\" \"We all started crying, because we had never played it before for a big crowd,\" says director Peter Farrelly.\n\nMany Hollywood insiders also believe it\u2019s Mortensen\u2019s turn to win a gold statue, after two best-actor nods for \"Captain Fantastic\" and \"Eastern Promises.\" On the awards prediction site GoldDerby.com, he has 4-to-1 odds of edging out Bradley Cooper (\"A Star is Born\") and Christian Bale (\"Vice\").\n\nGoldDerby founder Tom O'Neil calls \"Green Book\" a \"sleeping giant\" at the Oscars this year that could trigger \"lots of upsets.\" And despite a tight race for best actor, \"Viggo has some strong pluses,\" he says, citing the actor's radical physical transformation and the respect he holds inside Hollywood. \"Voters love to catch up with beloved industry veterans who are ridiculously overdue to win.\"\n\nAway from the red carpet, Mortensen lives by his own rules. He's still the proud owner of a flip phone, his one Luddite pleasure (well, aside from sending postcards to friends), and is in the midst of a self-made avalanche of responsibilities: an upcoming film he\u2019s directing, a publishing house he runs, a new book of Spanish poetry he\u2019s releasing.\n\nHe knows himself: \u201cIf I added social media and Instagram and Twitter, I\u2019d never get anything done.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/14/viggo-mortensen-just-may-win-oscar-last-green-book/1993984002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "AP Top 25 Podcast: UCF forces its way to national prominence", "description": "No. 11 Central Florida has won 22 straight games and is making a run at another major bowl bid", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/14/ap-top-25-podcast-ucf-forces-its-way-to-national-prominence/38527139/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0bc1b0a376b99158d93d000777ed669a998bcb79/c=0-214-4096-2518/local/-/media/2018/11/14/USATODAY/usatsports/49d5f7de173c49e79703e7396264138d.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:41:02Z", "content": "FILE - In this Nov. 10, 2018, file photo, Central Florida linebacker Gabriel Luyanda, left, and linebacker Nate Evans celebrate after the team recovered a fumble during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Navy, in Orlando, Fla.

(Photo: Edward C Baig)\n\nA perfect photo-op has presented itself. Well, perfect, that is, except for one critical problem: There\u2019s barely any light.\n\nYou could fire up a flash, but the results are often unsatisfactory. Besides, in some places using a flash is prohibited altogether. And a flash won\u2019t do you much good if what you want to shoot is a landscape.\n\nWhen Google launched the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL smartphones recently it promised a Night Sight feature that would address such problems, by letting you take pictures in dimly-lit places without a flash.\n\nOver the next few days, Night Sight will be coming to the latest Pixels, and the previous two generations of Google\u2019s Pixel phones, through an update to the Camera app. The feature works on both the front and rear cameras on these devices.\n\nMore: With Pixel 3 and Home Hub, Google wants its devices to be not just smart but 'thoughtful'\n\nI\u2019ve gotten to try the Night Sight ahead of time, using a Pixel 3 XL. I got decent albeit imperfect results. I was quite pleased with some night-time shots of my kids in the backyard, and in at least one instance with an indoor shot of my daughter taken in a dark room.\n\nWould you have known that this shot of Sydney Baig was taken in a dark room? It was captured on a Google Pixel 3 XL with the Night Sight feature. (Photo: Edward C. Baig)\n\nBut some images were badly pixelated, with the flaws especially visible if you zoom in on a picture. And a shot of the trees in my neighborhood came out a bit blurry and made nighttime look a bit like dusk.\n\nStill, most Night Sight pictures I took are more than Instagram-worthy. I had already reaped praise on the Pixel 3 XL camera in a prior review. The addition of Night Sight makes the already excellent camera here all the better.\n\nThe way Google explains Night Sight, the feature constantly adapts to you and your surroundings, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re holding the Pixel yourself or propping it on a steady surface. Before you press the shutter button, Night Sight measures your natural hand shake, and how much motion is in the scene. If Night Sight detects a still and stable scene, the camera will capture more light to minimize noise; if the Pixel does detect movement in the scene or by the shooter, Night Sight will use shorter exposures, capturing less light to minimize motion blur.\n\nSydney Baig in the backyards in a photo taken without a flash through the Night Shift mode on a Google Pixel. (Photo: Edward C. Baig)\n\nGoogle adds that if your subject moves, instead of capturing one bright and blurry photo, Night Sight will grab an equal amount of light over a burst of many dark but sharp photos. It will then merge the burst to help prevent motion blur and brighten the photo.\n\nWhen you launch the Camera app In some low light settings, you may see a notification suggesting you use Night Sight. But you can also manually turn on the setting.\n\nA backyard photo of Samuel Baig taken with the Night Sight feature on a Google Pixel phone. (Photo: Edward C. Baig)\n\nAfter I pressed the shutter my own Night Sight pictures, I was directed to hold the phone still for another couple of seconds\u2014and if you are shooting a person, you\u2019ll want to direct them to remain still too. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re shooting in Night Sight mode because the shutter button has a crescent moon-shaped icon on it.\n\nSan Francisco taken on a Google Pixel with the Night Sight feature. (Photo: Florian Kainz)\n\nIf it is very dark, it may help to tap on or around your subject to help the camera focus. But remember, you\u2019ll need at some light for the feature to work. There are no miracles to be had in the pitch black.\n\nI'll be shooting more nighttime features with the feature. And once those of you with Pixel have gotten to try Night Shift on your own device, send us sample photos and let us know what you think.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/14/google-night-sight-review-shoot-pictures-pixel-without-flash/1998418002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "For The Win, Andrew Joseph, For The Win", "title": "Division III basketball player takes flagrant shot at opponent's head", "description": "Fitchburg State's Kewan Platt appeared to throw a forearm/elbow at the head of Nichols' Nate Tenaglia during Tuesday night's game.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/fitchburg-state-kewan-platt-foul-cheap-shot-video-nichols-division-iii-basketball-player-college?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/14/USAT/fc0d0cb3-3cf8-4f09-a98d-fe4f4f8be43d-USP_High_School_Basketball-_McDonalds_High_School.jpg?crop=5471,3077,x0,y9&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:07:27Z", "content": "A general view of basketballs.

Reilly) is as much a lovable lunkhead as ever in \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d (\u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four; rated PG; in theaters Nov. 21), yet the follow-up centers on best friend, Vanellope Von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), realizing her dreams.\n\nMore: Disney changes 'Wreck-It Ralph 2' after complaints about a black princess' light skin\n\nMore: See exclusive first photos of Taraji P. Henson, Disney princesses in 'Wreck-It Ralph 2'\n\nTimes are just peachy at Litwak\u2019s Arcade for Ralph and his 8-bit friends, though they\u2019re a bit too fine for young Vanellope. She has grown bored being the resident princess of her game \u201cSugar Rush\u201d and yearns for something new.\n\nRalph takes that as her needing some improvement in her game to fulfill her need for speed, but his intervention leads to the wheel breaking on the \"Sugar Rush\" machine. The good news: Litwak\u2019s has just gotten Wi-Fi, so Ralph and Vanellope head into cyberspace to track down a replacement part on eBay.\n\nBeing video game characters, they don\u2019t have any money, which leads them to the shady world of J.P. Spamley (Bill Hader) and click bait clickbait for cash. High jinks ensue across the web from there: Vanellope falls in love with the online game \u201cSlaughter Race\u201d while Ralph, who\u2019s as disconcerted by the Internet as she\u2019s inspired, learns the power of \u201clikes\u201d and cat videos with trendy guru Yesss (Taraji P. Henson).\n\nRalph (voiced by John C. Reilly) and his fellow misfit Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) meet an algorithm named Yesss (Taraji P. Henson), who scours the net to find the hottest new content to post at her website BuzzzTube.com. (Photo: DISNEY)\n\nBut our heroic duo's relationship is really tested when their individual goals veer from each other's and Ralph struggles to let Vanellope spread her digital wings. The movie speaks to any mom and dad who've weathered conflicting feelings about their kids going to kindergarten, high school, college \u2013 and to anyone who has ever been flummoxed by the World Wide Web, which is pretty much everybody.\n\nAny popular meme or viral hit you can imagine is sent up by directors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston in this busy cyber-landscape. There\u2019s almost too much to watch in one viewing, but their takes on social media and online living tend to be pretty clever on the whole.\n\nThe dark web is a seedy underworld where dangerous viruses are born. The coolest place definitely is \u201cSlaughter Race,\u201d a \u201cMad Max\u201d-meets-\u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d post-apocalypse where Vanellope meets her new idol, street-racing ace Shank (Gal Gadot with a surprisingly hefty part).\n\nAlso: The new Grinch says 'sorry': Decoding the more sensitive Christmas villain (spoilers!)\n\nPreview: 10 movies you must see this holiday season, from 'Fantastic Beasts' to 'Mary Poppins'\n\nAs up-to-date and modern as the new \u201cRalph\u201d is, it leans old-school Disney. (Fun fact: It\u2019s the first feature-length theatrical sequel from the animation studio since \u201cFantasia 2000\u201d 18 years ago.) And the movie embraces everything about the House of Mouse: There\u2019s a whole sequence where Vanellope sees Iron Man and gets chased by Stormtroopers in an area that\u2019s a little too \u201cWe own your childhoods!\u201d\n\nShank (voiced by Gal Gadot, center) is the leader of a muscle-car crew in the online game \"Slaughter Race\" in the animated sequel \"Ralph Breaks the Internet.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\nAt least the filmmakers know how to do it right, because it leads to two of the most entertaining sequences in the film. Vanellope runs into the entire bevy of other Disney princesses and teaches them the positive points of comfortable clothing, and the meeting sets her on a path to embracing her identity. Vanellope even gets her own \u201cI want\u201d song, a tune by Alan Menken called \u201cA Place Called Slaughter Race\u201d that embraces both the princess factor and the usual goofy \u201cRalph\u201d humor.\n\nYou\u2019ll LOL, you\u2019ll cry-emoji, you\u2019ll never look at a pop-up ad the same way again.

Win line of scrimmage\n\nThe Seahawks are a tough, physical team dependent on pounding the football and controlling the line of scrimmage. Can the Packers recover in time and play with the right amount of energy and physicality up front? This is a game that will be won or lost up front. The Packers have the horsepower along the offensive and defensive lines to grind out a win, but they\u2019ll need to come out the gates firing. Matching Seattle\u2019s effort early will be key.\n\n2. Feed Aaron Jones\n\nThe Seahawks might have the top-ranked rushing offense in football, but the Packers can counter with the NFL\u2019s most efficient rushing offense, and they\u2019ll be facing a defense giving up 5.0 yards per carry this season. The game plan should be centered around Jones, who is averaging 6.8 yards per carry and coming off a career-best 145 yards rushing Sunday. The Packers need to make the Seahawks prove they win at the point of attack and maintain gap integrity for 60 minutes. Jones doesn\u2019t need much of a crease to rip off a big play.\n\n3. Turnover Russell Wilson\n\nThe Packers have produced 11 takeaways of Wilson in the last four meetings, including five interceptions in a blowout win at Lambeau Field in 2016 and a crucial, game-turning fumble recovery in Week 1 last season. Turnovers change games. Just ask the Seahawks, who have lost two straight games in part due to late giveaways. Wilson threw a pick-six in the fourth quarter of Seattle\u2019s loss to the Chargers and then lost a fumble \u2013 leading to a Rams touchdown \u2013 in last week\u2019s loss in Los Angeles. The Packers used a Bashaud Breeland interception to help put away the Dolphins on Sunday. Can they get another big takeaway or two in Seattle?\n\n4. Play clean on special teams\n\nThe Packers were able to survive a half-dozen notable special teams mistakes and still take down a beat up Dolphins team Sunday at Lambeau Field, but everyone knows what happens when the special teams implode against a good team on the road, especially in Seattle. More critical errors would make it very difficult to win away from home in a tough environment. The Packers have to give themselves a chance by playing a clean game.\n\n5. Start fast\n\nThere\u2019s no better way to quiet a crowd, bleed a stadium of energy and create a necessary cushion than starting fast and building confidence early. These are going to be tired teams taking the field Thursday night. The Packers can\u2019t afford to let the Seahawks get the crowd involved early. That could energize the home team and put the visitors in a tough spot, especially playing two time zones away on three day\u2019s rest. Whichever team starts fast could run away with it. The Packers need to be that team."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Charles Curtis", "title": "'The Challenge: Final Reckoning' power rankings after ep. 19", "description": "We rank the four remaining teams best to worst as they head into the final challenge.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/the-challenge-recap-final-reckoning-episode-19-cara-maria-joss-natalie", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/group_1.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:01:42Z", "content": "The Challenge, otherwise known as Americas fifth major sport (watch out hockey, its coming for you) is in the middle of a season in which the winners will receive $1 million.

JOSS AND SYLVIA\n\nPROS: Joss has proven he\u2019s the muscle to Sylvia\u2019s brains, although let\u2019s give Sylvia some credit, she\u2019s survived some tough physical challenges as well. The two of them are working beautifully together and they made a big power move with Hunter and Ashley to eventually send Bananas and Tony home. In a final that will pack in puzzles and physicality, these two should be the favorites going in.\n\nCONS: As I\u2019ve mentioned in previous editions of The Challenge power rankings, Sylvia keeps talking about how she doesn\u2019t run. That may prove to be a HUGE problem since final challenges usually involve lots of running.\n\n2. NATALIE AND PAULIE\n\nPROS: Another team that\u2019s worked together to navigate this minefield of a season. Natalie proved for the third or fourth time this season that she doesn\u2019t need to be the biggest or strongest to keep up \u2014 she outlasted Bananas by holding up her arms for FIVE AND A HALF HOURS in their Armageddon and has the battle scar from another one on her chin. Paulie has figured out how to channel his fire, and the pair might shock everyone.\n\nCONS: Paulie is a rookie, although that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t win \u2014 first-timers have done it before. Still, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re in for.\n\n3. ASHLEY AND HUNTER\n\nPROS: Ashley is a previous final winner \u2014 Invasion of the Champions \u2014 and Hunter played minor league baseball. We know when it comes to out-running other teams, they\u2019re probably the favorites.\n\nCONS: The problem is they continue to bicker and blame each other, and with the possibility that one might win and take all the money a la Johnny Bananas, you worry about their heads and ability to work together. If there\u2019s one moment either Ashley or Hunter fall behind, the blame game could derail them quickly.\n\n4. CARA MARIA AND MARIE\n\nPROS: Cara Maria won Vendettas and Battle of the Bloodlines, so she knows how to handle a final. And it\u2019s been heartening to see these two \u2014 who hated each other so much heading into this season \u2014 put their differences aside and work through a game that\u2019s been very much against them all year.\n\nCONS: Marie has improved over the year, but can she dominate in a final?"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Ravens Wire", "title": "Ravens new RB Ty Montgomery might play vs. Bengals", "description": "The Baltimore Ravens were active at the NFL's trade deadline in a rare sight.

After the bye and a full week of practice, Montgomery could have captured enough of the playbook to play in a critical game against the Bengals.\n\nHarbaugh noted the next three practices would be important for Montgomery. With a completely new playbook and new terminology to learn to be competent in Baltimore\u2019s scheme, Montgomery can show in practice he\u2019s ready.\n\nThe Ravens are hoping Montgomery can help their struggling offense. Baltimore is getting the second-fewest yards per attempt from their rushing attack in the NFL. Though that has largely been due to poor blocking by the offensive line and a willingness to abandon the run far too early by offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg rather than the play of the running backs. Still, Montgomery could offer a spark both on the ground as well as a receiving threat and return specialist.\n\nIn seven games with the Packers this season, Montgomery had 26 carries for 105 yards and a touchdown, along with 15 catches for 170 yards. On special teams, he returned 10 kickoffs for 210 yards, though he had a critical fumble in a Week 8 loss, two days before he was traded.\n\nWith the Ravens sitting at 4-5, they could use all the positive sparks they can get. A win against Cincinnati could catapult them to the No. 6 seed, while a loss would all but kick them out of the playoff race given tiebreaker scenarios.\n\nGallery 16 best photos of Ty Montgomery with Packers, Stanford"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": null, "title": "Black Friday vs. Cyber Monday", "description": "Two big days.

The 60-year-old Williams coached Buffalo in 2001-03. (AP Photo/Ron Schwane, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 As John Dorsey prepares to make a critical decision he knows may shape Cleveland's football fortunes, the Browns general manager spends a moment every day giving himself a pep talk.\n\nAnd a stern warning.\n\n\"Just make sure you don't mess it up, that's what I tell myself,\" Dorsey said. \"Just don't mess this thing up.\"\n\nDorsey is in the early stages of heading his first coaching search with the Browns, who have been in a futile pursuit of a competent leader for nearly as long as they've been looking for a quarterback.\n\nWith the Browns (3-6-1) on their bye this week, Dorsey provided some insight into a quest that will accelerate once the season is completed and conclude with Cleveland's ninth coach since 1999.\n\nAs expected, Dorsey said interim coach Gregg Williams will be one of the candidates interviewed. Dorsey has been impressed with the job that Williams, the team's fiery defensive coordinator, has done over the past two weeks since taking over for Hue Jackson, who was fired on Oct. 29 after going just 3-36-1 in two-plus seasons.\n\nThe Browns beat Atlanta 28-16 on Sunday and have split their two games under the 60-year-old Williams, who Dorsey feels he has provided more than stability.\n\n\"I've always been a believer of you play the game like you practice and I think these practices have been very competitive,\" Dorsey said. \"They've been very structured, they've been very disciplined, and guys have had some energy and that's the difference I see. There's been a focus on the little things which I think is important.\"\n\nWilliams has previous head coaching experience with Buffalo from 2001-2003. He was also the defensive coordinator in New Orleans from 2009-2011, when he guided a group that won the Super Bowl but was also embroiled in the \"Bountygate\" scandal that resulted in him being suspended by the NFL for one season.\n\nBesides Williams, Dorsey has been pleased with how Cleveland's offense has played under running backs coach Freddie Kitchens, who took over play-calling duties when coordinator Todd Haley was fired the same day as Jackson. Dorsey would not speculate on Kitchens' future with the team, but said he \"has done a heck of a job.\"\n\nDorsey would not divulge who else in upper Cleveland's management team will help him find a coach, but he was adamant the Browns will not hire an outside firm to assist, which is something owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam have done in the past.\n\n\"We don't need that,\" he snapped.\n\nDorsey was tight-lipped on other aspects of the search, including whether he would be willing to hire a college coach with no pro experience. However, he did outline the traits he's seeking in a new coach.\n\n\"For me personally, I would like to see a man of character,\" he said. \"I would like to see a man who can lead young men. I would like a man who has high football acumen. Those are the three basic things there I'm looking for.\"\n\nDorsey promised to be as publicly quiet about the search as he was earlier this year when he kept Cleveland's No. 1 draft pick a well-guarded secret before choosing quarterback Baker Mayfield.\n\nThat selection is part of why Dorsey feels Cleveland's coaching gig is so appealing. Mayfield is showing signs of growth and along with rookie running back Nick Chubb, defensive end Myles Garrett, wide receiver Jarvis Landry and others, the Browns have a talented core of young players. The Browns also have nearly $60 million in salary cap space, a rabid fan base, 11 draft picks in 2019 and committed owners fixated on winning.\n\n\"Those are exciting things for this organization moving forward,\" he said. \"Anybody, once they understand that, you will see that, you know what? Cleveland is a good place to be.\"\n\nNOTES: Dorsey had little to say about Jackson returning to Cincinnati as a special assistant to Bengals coach Marvin Lewis. \"I wish him the best,\" he said. \"It was hard a couple of weeks ago.\" ... Dorsey would not say if he intends to interview former Arizona coach Bruce Arians, who is retired and doing TV analysis but has expressed interest in Cleveland's opening. \"I have a lot of respect for coach Arians,\" Dorsey said. \"Right now, we are in the process of beginning to finalize our plan. If it comes to the appropriate time and if he happens to be one of the people, you will find out.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nNetflix is experimenting with a half-price, mobile-only subscription to its popular streaming service. The catch? For now you have to live someplace such as Malaysia.\n\nThe Los Gatos, California-headquartered company confirmed it is currently testing a mobile-only subscription in some countries including Malaysia. Malaysian news site The Star Online first reported the test, which TechCrunch subsequently wrote up.\n\nThe mobile-only subscription is priced at about $4, half that of the basic service Netflix offers in Malaysia. Subscribers to the plan can watch on one handheld device such as a smartphone or tablet. Video is delivered in standard definition, not high-def.\n\n\"We are always looking for ways to make Netflix more enjoyable and more accessible to people all over the world,\" Netflix said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"In this case, we are testing to understand consumer interest in a mobile-only plan in some countries. Generally, we try out lots of new ideas at any given time, and they can vary in how long they last and who sees them. We may not ever roll out the features or elements included in a test.\"\n\nLast week, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings told Bloomberg the net TV provider planned to test a lower-priced subscription to boost sales in international markets including Asia. Netflix currently has 137.1 million subscribers globally, 57 percent of them outside the U.S.\n\nMobile subscriptions could eventually drive huge growth for the company. Hastings noted the massive installed base of smartphones in India last month while discussing Netflix's third-quarter performance with analysts.\n\nFor instance, India has more than 300 million households but almost twice as many mobile phone subscriptions. \"So there's a huge market, and people in India, like around the world, love watching television,\" Hastings said. \"Now we'll take it a million at a time and figure out how to expand the market as we grow.\"\n\nNetflix has tested different subscriber offerings in different markets. Earlier this year, the streaming company tested a higher-priced premium \"Ultra\" subscription in Europe offering 4K Ultra HD video with High Dynamic Range (HDR) quality and the ability to watch on four screens at the same time for 17 euros, or about $20.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/14/netflix-testing-cheaper-mobile-only-version-its-service/1998516002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh marry", "description": "Shots from Lake Como as Bollywood superstars Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh tie the knot in Italy.

The officer was a team leader for a regional SWAT team assembled by police departments in Chicago's south suburbs.\n\n\"We view this as the equivalent of a 'blue on blue,' friendly fire incident,\" Delaney said.\n\nIn an initial statement on the incident, Delaney referred to Roberson as \"a subject with a gun.\" He later praised Roberson.\n\n\u201cThe Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident, and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel, his family and his friends,\" he said. \"There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with.\u201d\n\nMore: Police chief praises security guard killed by cop: 'Jemel Roberson was a brave man'\n\nMore: Police officer near Chicago fatally shot security guard who was detaining a suspect\n\nThe preliminary investigation found that the incident started around 4 a.m. Sunday when an armed person entered the lounge and fired, striking multiple people.\n\nThe suspect suffered non-life-threatening wounds and was hospitalized. He has not been charged.\n\nThe Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office is investigating the shooting inside the bar.\n\nIllinois State Police Sgt. Jacqueline Cepeda said there is no timeline for completing the investigation of the police shooting. She declined to say whether the officer wore a body camera or if the incident was captured by any other video surveillance.\n\nCepeda said the task force will present its findings to the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office prosecution bureau, which will determine whether the shooting was legally justified or if charges against the officer are merited.\n\nState police asked any witnesses who saw the officer shoot Roberson or have knowledge about what happened inside the bar to come forward.\n\nBeatrice Roberson, the security guard's mother, filed a federal lawsuit against Midlothian and the officer \u2013 identified only as John Doe \u2013 seeking more than $1 million in damages.\n\nShe called the officer\u2019s action \u201cunprovoked\u201d and an \u201cexcessive and unreasonable\u201d use of force.\n\nRoberson suffered multiple gunshot wounds, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.\n\nRobbins is a predominantly black community of about 5,500 residents south of Chicago. Mayor Tyrone Ward expressed anguish about the incident Tuesday evening.\n\nWard declined to weigh in on the Midlothian officer\u2019s decision to shoot, but he wondered whether the situation would have ended differently if a Robbins officer had encountered Roberson first.\n\n\"I wish it had been one of our (officers) who came across the situation,\" Ward said. \"They may have been more familiar with security (at the bar).

Mimi Walters in Orange County, which had been considered a Republican stronghold in a state where Democrats hold a 3.7 million voter advantage in registration. Another Orange County Republican, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, was defeated in his re-election bid for a 16th term, and the seat held by retiring GOP Rep. Darrell Issa also flipped.\n\nAnd Democrats still have hopes of sweeping all four Republican Orange County seats.

Harder made Denham's vote against the Affordable Care Act a focus of his campaign and vowed to fight for universal health care.\n\nDenham held a slight lead on Election Day, but Harder overtook the incumbent as the vote count continued and eventually widened his lead to an insurmountable 4,919 votes.\n\nIt was an expensive contest. Harder raised more than $6.5 million to Denham's $4.5 million. And at least 26 outside groups spent another $10 million trying to influence the race, according to California Target Book, which analyzes campaigns.\n\nAnother Republican incumbent from California to give up his seat was Rep.

(Photo: John Locher, AP)\n\nThe death toll of the deadliest wildfire in California history rose to 56 on Wednesday \u2013 and more bodies might be discovered by evacuees returning home, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea warned.\n\nThe number of structures destroyed also went up to 10,321 \u2014 of which 8,650 are single-family homes \u2014 and the Camp Fire's size grew to 215 square miles. It is at 35 percent containment, fire officials said at a press conference.\n\nThe blaze that broke out the morning of Nov. 8 has forced the evacuation of 52,000 people, of whom 1,385 are still in shelters. Another 130 people remain unaccounted for.\n\n\"If you see anyone on the list who is no longer missing, please contact us so their name can be removed,\" Honea said.\n\nHonea said the deliberate search through the rubble of the Camp Fire, 90 miles north of Sacramento, is continuing. But he acknowledged that the \"very, very difficult task\" of searching for remains could mean that when residents return to their charred homes they could discover remains themselves amid the carnage.\n\n\"I know that's a very difficult thing to think about,\" Honea said, noting that anyone who discovers a fire victim should immediately notify his office.\n\nCooler weather and a respite from the wind, however, was slowing the fire's growth, Cal Fire said.\n\nMore: How do wildfires start? All it takes is a spark\n\nMore: 'Unprecedented' Camp Fire's death toll rises again, to 48\n\nEncouraging news on Woolsey Fire\n\nFive-hundred miles to the south, the Woolsey Fire burning west of Los Angeles was blamed for a third death on Wednesday. The fire has burned 153 square miles and destroyed more than 450 homes and businesses, Cal Fire said.\n\nChief Daryl Osby of Los Angeles County Fire Department said firefighters were making progress against the Woolsey Fire, listed as 52 percent contained. This despite Santa Ana winds that buffeted the area with gusts of up to 45 mph and a forecast calling for no rain until at least the end of next week. \u201c(We\u2019re) getting the upper hand here. \u2026There is a lot of confidence as it relates to the containment and control of this fire. We\u2019re feeling better. Our containment percentages have increased,\u201d Osby said.\n\nCause of Camp Fire under investigation\n\nCal Fire was keeping people out of the area where the fire began while it conducts an investigation into the cause of the blaze. Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey also locked down the area where the fire started protected for a possible criminal investigation. A PG&E spokesman on Tuesday declined to say whether work on the power lines had anything to do with starting the fire. \"The cause of the Camp Fire has not been determined. Cal Fire is investigating the cause of the fire,\" said Paul Moreno, a PG&E spokesman.\n\nThis is how wildfires start\n\nDeadly wildfires can begin with something as simple as a downed power line, a flat tire or a tossed cigarette butt. Once a fire ignites, the combination of wind, heat, oxygen and fuel (tinder-dry forests, brush, etc.) can cause it to explode in size. In the early history of the Earth, nearly all wildfires were started by lightning strikes. Nowadays, 84 percent of wildfires in the USA are started by people, according to a comprehensive study in 2017 published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nNo pets \u2013 OK, they can stay\n\nThe signs pasted on the windows of the gymnasium at Pierce College in Woodland Hills are clear: \u201cNo Pets.\u201d But, inside, a giant tortoise is ... slowly ... walking ... laps ... around the lobby of Pierce College\u2019s gymnasium. The college canceled classes because of the Woolsey Fire and turned its gym into a Red Cross Emergency Evacuation Center. Many evacuees left their homes in a hurry, and cats and dogs are a fact of life at the shelter. \u201cWhat we know is that people love their animals, and we\u2019re here to help,\u201d said Allison Cardona, deputy director for County of Los Angeles Animal Care and Control.\n\nPink's hubby has warning for looters\n\nCarey Hart, husband of singer Pink, made it clear that he is not afraid to exercise his Second Amendment rights against looters in areas damaged by the Woolsey Fire west of Los Angeles. The former motocross star posted on Instagram a photo of a dozen gun-wielding men standing in front of a sign that reads, \"Looters will be shot on site.\" Hart commented under the picture that he is not one of the masked men, adding \"if you are a looter, think twice if you are heading back into Malibu.\"\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Sandy Hooper, Cydney Henderson, Steve Kiggins\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/14/california-fires-evacuees-might-return-find-bodies-burned-homes/1997876002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Nancy Armour, USA TODAY", "title": "International Olympic Committee running out of cities that will throw its parties", "description": "The Olympics are being recognized as an economic boondoggle.

(Photo: Kelvin Kuo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCall this payback for the International Olympic Committee\u2019s decades of greed and deceit.\n\nOnce a prize that cities on every continent fought over, so blinded were they by the promise of civic and infrastructure improvements, the Olympics are now being recognized for the economy-busting boondoggle they are. Calgary on Tuesday joined Sapporo, Japan; Sion, Switzerland; and Graz, Austria, in saying \u201cthanks, but no thanks\u201d for the right to throw the IOC a lavish party in February 2026, and there\u2019s a good possibility bids in Italy and Stockholm could soon follow.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a 2026 oddity, either. More cities (eight) dropped out of the bidding for the 2022 and 2024 Olympics than stayed in (four). Several others took themselves out of the running before the official process began.\n\nAnd, really, who can blame them? The graft and corruption that was part and parcel of Rio 2016 has worsened Brazil\u2019s economic collapse. Meanwhile, the Olympic park is a graveyard of crumbling venues and the waterways that were supposed to be cleaned up remain cesspools.\n\nThe flame was barely out at the Pyeongchang Games in February when civic leaders suggested they might have to raze some venues because they couldn\u2019t be repurposed and there wasn\u2019t money to pay for the upkeep of empty buildings. Never mind the environmental damage done to build a ski venue that lasted only as long as the Olympics did.\n\nOh, the IOC talks a good game, saying it\u2019s serious about reform so that no city again spends itself into oblivion.\n\n\u201cI can tell you for \u201926, we are ruthless on this: Don\u2019t even consider building a venue if there is not a 50-year legacy plan,\u201d Christophe Dubi, executive director of the Olympic Games, told The Associated Press in September.\n\nBut Tokyo\u2019s preparation for the Summer Games in 2020 reveals the lie in that.\n\nTokyo was supposed to restore economic sanity to the Olympics. By using several venues left from the 1964 Games and keeping its plan compact, organizers initially said it would cost just $7 billion to host the 2020 Olympics.\n\nCompared with the $13 billion the Rio Olympics cost and the whopping $50 billion price tag for Sochi, Tokyo would be a bargain!\n\nThen came the changes. This venue wouldn\u2019t work and this sport had to be moved and this arena had to be built. Now the venues are sprawled across the metropolitan area, some as far as an hour away, and a Japanese government report estimates the tab for Tokyo 2020 will exceed $25 billion.\n\nWith 18 months still to go before the Games begin, who knows how much higher it will climb.\n\n\u201cI think that people had enough of the establishment telling us what to do, what to think,\u201d Sean Chu, a Calgary councilman and fierce opponent of a 2026 bid, told The Calgary Herald on Tuesday night after 56 percent of voters said they did not want the city to bid for the Winter Olympics.\n\n\u201cThey tell you to spend millions, billions, it\u2019s good for you.\u201d\n\nHear that IOC?\n\nYes, it\u2019s bid organizers and civic leaders who dream up these plans so grandiose they make a 5-year-old\u2019s letter to Santa look spartan. But the IOC is supposed to be the adult in the room, and it has shown no interest in reining in these fanciful projects.\n\nWhy should it? The IOC isn\u2019t the one footing the bill. So long as IOC members have five-star hotels to rest their heads, cars to whisk them to venues, Michelin star-quality food in the \u201cIOC family\u201d lounges and per diems that can go as high as $900, they don\u2019t really care about pesky things like budget overruns and taxes on the populace.\n\nMaybe a few see the storm clouds on the horizon. The rest are either so arrogant or oblivious they believe there\u2019s always going to be a city \u2014 or an autocrat \u2014 willing to take their sucker bet.\n\nBut the payoff for hosting an Olympics is, too often, fool's gold. The Calgary referendum is just the latest sign that cities are getting wise to the IOC's games.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Pelosi talks Calif. wildfires, Speaker's race", "description": "Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi expressed condolences to families shattered by the California wildfires and expressed confidence that she'll lead the Democrats when a new Congress convenes in January.

The latest incident \u2014 a heated argument with Kevin Durant when Green failed to find him for a potential game-winner at the end of regulation \u2014 got Green suspended.\n\nLet\u2019s look back at other times Green\u2019s gone over the top:\n\n1. Green kicks opponents, various years\n\nThis has stopped in the last couple of seasons, but Green got a reputation for kicking his leg out on rebounds and drives to the basket and finding defenders\u2019 crotches and faces.\n\n2. Green and Steve Kerr don\u2019t see eye to eye, 2015-16\n\nThere\u2019s a whole 2016 ESPN story on the relationship between the head coach and the forward, and they had some really tense moments. Just watch Green\u2019s speech during the 2015 championship parade above in which he talks about Kerr \u201chating\u201d him. It\u2019s kind of awkward.\n\nSo was this Lisa Salters report from a locker room spat between Green and Kerr during a game between the Thunder and Warriors. From that ESPN story:\n\nIn her report following halftime, ESPN sideline reporter Lisa Salters will recite a portion of Green\u2019s explosion: \u201cI am not a robot! I know I can play! You have me messed up right now! If you don\u2019t want me to shoot, I won\u2019t shoot the rest of the game!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m standing outside the locker room with the Oklahoma City police, which are always stationed outside of every locker room,\u201d Salters will later recall. \u201cThey kind of moved me aside, and the officer just kind of stood by the door, with his hand on his weapon like he was trying to determine what he should do. It was clear that something bad was about to happen in this locker room. We\u2019ve never heard anything like this before.\u201d\n\n3. The LeBron James crotch punch, 2016\n\nThere are some who wonder if the Cleveland Cavaliers would have won a title in 2016 had Green not been suspended for Game 5 of the NBA Finals. The Cavs came back from a 3-1 deficit \u2014 sparking countless memes \u2014 and LeBron got a ring for Ohio.\n\n4. Green and Durant get heated, 2017\n\nThis happened more than once.\n\n5.

That's kind of all that matters.\"\n\nZverev's earlier win over Cilic in the round-robin means both those players still have a chance of reaching the semifinals for the first time.\n\nThe top-ranked Djokovic and third-seeded Zverev engaged in a number of thrilling early exchanges, but it wasn't until the ninth game that Zverev earned the first break point of the match, aided by a friendly net cord. Djokovic saved it with a service winner but then double-faulted to give the 21-year-old another opportunity.\n\nZverev played a defensive forehand slice to set up a chance to finish the point with a backhand lob, but his attempt drifted just wide and Djokovic held on for 5-4.\n\nZverev gave Djokovic a set point with a spate of errors in the next game, and conceded it with a double-fault.\n\n\"If I made the break, it goes the other direction a little bit,\" Zverev said.\n\nIn the second set, Djokovic broke for a 3-1 lead and then lost just one more point as he remained on track to equal Roger Federer's six titles at the tournament.\n\nVictory in London would cap a remarkable season for Djokovic, who has already secured the year-end No. 1 ranking after dropping as low as No. 22 in June.\n\nThe 31-year-old Djokovic ended a two-year Grand Slam title drought by winning Wimbledon in July before collecting his 14th major trophy at the U.S. Open.\n\nCilic ended a four-match losing streak at the O2 Arena as he came from behind to beat Isner, the hard-serving American who is making his debut at the tournament. It was the first match all week that went to three sets.\n\n\"The first set was extremely tough and John played a great tie-break,\" Cilic said. \"I had to stay patient, stay focused, and I played really great tennis in the second and third set.\"\n\nIsner was wearing the initials 'KM' on his shoes as a tribute to his close friend and former fitness coach, Kyle Morgan, who died earlier this week.\n\n\"It's difficult, very difficult,\" Isner said. \"Got to go out there and play.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But \u201cI love the tragicomedy area. A lot of the stuff I liked doing most was (movies) 'Falling Down' and 'Wonder Boys.' I was always attracted to that area. The chance to do comedy, which is not necessarily what I\u2019m not known for or comes easily to me, was a learning process and a chance to learn more about timing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also his first regular TV role since the 1970s, when Douglas, then 27, was cast opposite Karl Malden on ABC's \u201cThe Streets of San Francisco.\u201d\n\nThe eight-episode first season, out Friday, reveals Sandy as \u201can extremely successful acting teacher, but the other parts of his life are not quite as successful,\u201d Douglas says.

Polay/ HBO)\n\n\"Game of Thrones\" fans have a long five months to wait until April 2019, when the eighth and final season is set to premiere, but David Nutter, a longtime director for the show, is helping to tide them over just a little bit.\n\nNutter answered fan questions about the eighth season of HBO's fantasy epic on on Tuesday, in an \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Reddit. The director gave away as much info as he possible could about the finale without spoiling anything.\n\nHere are the biggest things we learned about Season 8.\n\nSeason 8 only has six episodes, but don't expect it to be short\n\nThe \"Thrones\" filmmakers have been saying practically since Season 7 began that Season 8's episodes would be long, and Nutter tacitly confirmed that. \"Season 8 episodes will all I think be longer than 60 minutes,\" he said. \"They\u2019ll be dancing around the bigger numbers, I know that for sure.\"\n\nThe Red Wedding has nothing on Season 8, apparently\n\nNutter directed the infamous Season 3 episode \"The Rains of Castemere,\" which contained the Red Wedding. When a fan asked how the new season would compare to that iconic moment from the series, Nutter replied, \"As far as Season 8 compared to the Red Wedding I just have to tell you - hang onto your seat cause it\u2019s going to be special.\"\n\nThe creators and actors took their time with the final season\n\nNutter underscored how much pressure there was to get the finale of the show right, and how much work everyone put in to the final season.\n\n\"There was not a second chance to get all of these sequences right, and a lot of sequences had many actors in them and some wonderfully intimate scenes as well,\" he said. \"So really it was about taking these characters from point A to B to C to D to E in the various episodes that I did, and making sure that it all balances out properly. We had a lot of rehearsal time and that was really the thing that saved me more than anything else. I'm very happy with the chance to get in there and rehearse with the actors, and I think they were too, and I think it turned out quite well.\"\n\nAnd when asked about why there was such a long break between Seasons 7 and 8, Nutter explained that it was due to the series' complex digital effects. \"Things take time my friends \u2014 they take a lot of time to create and GoT is the last place you\u2019re going to find half baked work so it\u2019s all about making sure they fill the frame with as much capacity as possible and making it as real and right as possible. Small price to pay for the amazing quality that comes out of that show,\" he said.\n\nMore: This is when the final season of 'Game of Thrones' will premiere\n\nThere will be at least one direwolf in Season 8\n\nA fan asked Nutter if there will be direwolves in Season 8, the huge wolf companions of the Stark family, citing fan displeasure with not seeing Jon Snow's (Kit Harington) direwolf in Season 7 too much. Nutter replied, \"Well, I have to say that you will see a direwolf in Season 8. That's all I can say.\"\n\nHe's happy with how things turn out\n\nWhen asked to describe the final season in three words, Nutter had this to offer: \"Season 8 in three words \u2014 Spectacular, Inspiring, Satisfying.\"\n\nHopefully the season is as inspiring to fans as it is to the director.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/14/game-thrones-season-8-director-david-nutter-drops-hints/1998318002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Kevin Johnson and Bart Jansen, USA TODAY", "title": "DOJ: Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker 'unquestionably' authorized to lead department", "description": "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is \"unquestionably\" authorized to head Justice Department despite lack of Senate confirmation, the department said", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/14/matthew-whitaker-authorized-department-justice-acting-attorney-general/1997460002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/12/USAT/b65bd511-a932-48ca-8935-f595ca4be0dd-AP_Trump_Sessions_1.JPG?crop=4925,2786,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:29:12Z", "content": "Matthew Whitaker was previous Jeff Sessions' chief of staff.

Sessions submitted his resignation on Wednesday, one day after the 2018 midterm elections. USA TODAY\n\nMatthew Whitaker has been critical of Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. (Photo: Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Justice Department defended President Donald Trump's appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, asserting Wednesday that his senior executive status at the department \u201cunquestionably\u201d authorized him to serve despite his lack of Senate confirmation.\n\nThe 20-page opinion issued by Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel based its findings on provisions of the Vacancies Reform Act, which allows for the appointment of a senior staffer who had been in office for at least 90 days. Before his appointment, Whitaker served as chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was fired Nov. 7.\n\nThe opinion was released after Whitaker\u2019s appointment was attacked by Democrats and some Republicans who argued that even an interim replacement for Sessions requires Senate confirmation.\n\nTwo Republican former U.S. attorneys general \u2013 Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales \u2014 questioned the propriety of the appointment because Whitaker hadn't served in a Senate-confirmed position.\n\nAlthough Justice\u2019s own line of succession provides for the deputy attorney general or other confirmed officials to serve as acting attorney general in the event of a vacancy, the Justice opinion argued that the internal provision for succession \u201cdoes not displace the president\u2019s authority to use the Vacancies Reform Act as an alternative.\u201d\n\nThe opinion said Whitaker\u2019s designation was in keeping with the Constitution, which requires the president to obtain Senate approval before appointing \u201cprincipal\u201d officers.\n\n\u201cAlthough an attorney general is a principal officer requiring Senate confirmation, someone who temporarily performs his duties is not,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cAs all three branches of government have long recognized, the president may designate an acting official to perform the duties of vacant principal office, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate.\u201d\n\nThe last time an acting attorney general served without Senate confirmation was in 1866, when Assistant Attorney General J. Hubley Ashton served for six days after the resignation of Attorney General James Speed, according to the report.\n\nThe opinion said presidential authority to make such designations dated to the early years of the government, citing 160 appointments before 1860 in which \u201cnon-Senate-confirmed persons performed, on a temporary basis,\u201d the duties of secretaries of state, treasury, war, Navy, interior and postmaster general.\n\n\u201cMr. Whitaker\u2019s designation is no more constitutionally problematic than countless similar presidential orders dating back over 200 years,\u201d the opinion said.\n\nDemocrats contended that Whitaker, even if he is permitted to serve, should be recused from overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Whitaker was sharply critical of the inquiry and suggested it could be defunded before he joined the department a year ago.\n\nThe Justice opinion did not address any issues related to recusal or whether Whitaker\u2019s authority is limited in any way.\n\nLawmakers criticized Whitaker's appointment and sought to protect Mueller.\n\nFour House Democrats who are likely to lead committees when the new Congress convenes in January announced Wednesday they would investigate Whitaker's involvement with World Patent Marketing, a company that allegedly bilked customers of millions of dollars. Whitaker served on the company's advisory board.\n\nThe lawmakers \u2013 Elijah Cummings of Maryland on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jerrold Nadler of New York on the Judiciary Committee, Frank Pallone of New Jersey on the Energy and Commerce Committee and Adam Schiff of California on the Intelligence Committee \u2013 said \"serious questions are now arising about his fitness to serve in this position of trust\" after the lack of Senate confirmation.\n\nSen. Christopher Coons, D-Del., said on MSNBC Tuesday, \"Whitaker strikes me as a clear and present danger to the independence of the special counsel.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., urged the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on Whitaker \"to ensure that he will take no action to restrict or otherwise interfere\" with Mueller's work.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said he would ask Wednesday for a Senate vote on legislation that would prevent firing Mueller.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already expressed hostility toward the Mueller investigation,\" Flake said. \"I think that\u2019s a pretty good reason.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Wednesday that Mueller's investigation is in \"no danger\" and Whitaker's appointment makes no difference.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any legislation is necessary,\" McConnell said. \"We know how the president feels about the Mueller investigation, but he\u2019s never said he wants to shut it down.\"\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins and Cat Hofacker\n\nMore: What has acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker said about the Mueller investigation?\n\nMore: Maryland files federal court challenge asking judge to block Whitaker, install Rosenstein\n\nMore: Two Republican former AGs raise questions on Trump's naming Matthew Whitaker to lead Justice Department\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/14/matthew-whitaker-authorized-department-justice-acting-attorney-general/1997460002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Nancy Trejos, USA TODAY", "title": "Japan: Travel + Leisure's top destination for 2018", "description": "Travel + Leisure chose Japan for its history, cities, trails, and cuisine.

Real-time, hole-by-hole statistics will be displayed on the screen to forecast the probability of different outcomes during the match.\n\nMORE GOLF\n\nDetails of The Match: Tiger vs. Phil\n\nTrash talking: Tiger doesn't take the bait\n\nNot surprisingly, there will be gambling. As luck would have it, the match is being played on a golf course in Las Vegas. The race and sports books at MGM Resorts will be delivering odds, moneyline and other information about the golfers\u2019 performances, also right there on the screen. Tiger and Phil will make all kinds of side bets on shots and putts, with that money being donated to charity.\n\nYour TV screen will be so full of numbers, facts and information that you might think you\u2019re watching CNBC and forget you\u2019re actually watching golf. Perhaps that\u2019s the point.\n\nAnd there will be drone coverage! Live, state-of-the-art drone coverage \u201cdelivering camera angles that have never been seen before for a live golf event.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m imagining the possibilities: let\u2019s go live to the Tree Cam. How about a Squirrel Cam? Perhaps a Phil\u2019s Wallet Cam, for all the action there?\n\nTiger, Phil and their caddies will be wearing microphones throughout the match \u201cto capture the strategy and competitive banter that takes place,\u201d according to the event\u2019s press release.\n\nIf we were talking about the final round of the Masters or the U.S. Open, I would be hanging on their every word. This being a made-for-TV spectacle that means absolutely nothing, it\u2019s natural to wonder if the dialogue will be entirely spontaneous. Nothing is scripted or planned out in advance, right guys?\n\nNo matter how goofy or staged this might be, golf nuts will buy in, and the broadcast certainly could be a success, especially in the demographic that buys big cars, cigars and life insurance. They won\u2019t mind a TV screen reminding them of a financial network as the markets open. With legal sports gambling coming in this country in a big way, and soon, perhaps this is what all golf broadcasts will look like someday. Once Tiger is done, the game will need something to perk up its ratings.\n\nAnd you know what? If I had to pay to watch two guys play golf, I\u2019d pick these two, even now. Tiger\u2019s comeback at 42 is remarkable, and Phil is Phil, impossible to ignore even at 48. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll put on a good show.\n\nBut in a holiday weekend overflowing with real, meaningful sports events, faux golf is out of place. Look at the trade-off you\u2019ll be making if you watch: while either Tiger or Phil will make $9 million in the winner-take-all match, you\u2019ll give up four hours of your life that you\u2019ll never get back."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Egerton on 'Rocketman': 'I've never been so excited about anything'", "description": "Actor Taron Egerton can't wait for fans to see him play Elton John in the forthcoming \"Rocketman\" movie.

Wood convinced Mahan to invite a teenager named Cameron Champ to Mahan's junior golf event. That was a pivotal moment in Champ reaching the PGA Tour. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Cameron Champ was a freshman in high school and a graduate of The First Tee program, missing only the means to travel the country to play junior golf tournaments with hopes of getting noticed outside Northern California.\n\nOne phone call made a difference as big as some of his drives.\n\nHis father called John Wood, an old friend from high school in Sacramento who at the time was caddying for Hunter Mahan.\n\n\"He said his son was into golf and would I come out and spend a day with him,\" Wood said Wednesday morning from the Australian Open, where he now works for Matt Kuchar. \"You get those calls and figure you'll go watch a guy shoot 80. But I literally watched Cam hit three shots and thought: 'Hang on. Something is very, very, very different here.' You could see the physical talent, and he's such a polite kid, the kind you'd want to help. His potential was off the charts.\"\n\nChamp is a top attraction this week in the RSM Classic at Sea Island, mainly because of how far he hits the ball, partly because of the attention he gets from how far he hits the ball. He began his rookie season six weeks ago and won the Sanderson Farms Championship in his second start as a PGA Tour member. His clubhead speed has been clocked at just under 130 mph, faster than anyone on tour. His ball speed has been measured at just over 192 mph coming off the club, another head-turner.\n\nHe still views that phone call as a pivotal moment.\n\nWood made a pitch to Mahan, who invited Champ to his American Junior Golf Association event in Texas. Champ took it from there.\n\n\"I still look back on that as if I didn't get that, who knows what would happen?\" Champ said. \"For my family, there was no way for us to be able to travel and play so many of those events to get rankings up.\"\n\nWood said he first called friends at Ping Golf, a big supporter of junior golf, which helped Champ with equipment. Then he talked to Mahan, who was in the third year hosting the Under Armour Hunter Mahan Championship outside Dallas as part of the AJGA circuit.\n\n\"He had two exemptions he could give out, and I planted the seed with Hunter,\" Wood said. \"I told him this kid has not had much exposure, no one knows much about him because he hasn't played much nationally, but if you take a look at giving him an exemption, it will be worth your while. Hunter was awesome. He gave him a spot, and he ended up losing in a playoff. But it put him on the map and set him up to play in a lot of events.\"\n\nThe seed was planted, and the growth was rapid.\n\n\"That kind of just spurred me on,\" Champ said. \"I got enough points, all the AJGA rankings to move up. I played my next one and next one, kept playing and got the rankings. And from there, it just kind of went on.\"\n\nHe said grants from the AJGA allowed him to travel. Champ was an AJGA All-American the next two years, played in the 2012 Junior Ryder Cup team and landed at Texas A&M, where he was slowed by back injuries his first two years.\n\nHe first got noticed on a big stage when he qualified for the 2017 U.S. Open at Erin Hills and led the field with an average drive of just under 350 yards. One year on the Web.com Tour the next season brought his first professional victory and a ticket to the big leagues.\n\nEverything about Champ is about big, starting with tee shots created by incredible speed without looking as though he's swinging hard.\n\nHe won the Sanderson Farms Championship by four shots with a late string of birdies. He was in the hunt last week at Mayakoba, a shorter golf course that demands precision off the tee, flighting his shots low and with movement. It wasn't just smashing driver. He showed off an array of shots.\n\nEven so, with Champ the conversation starts with power.\n\nHe tries not to get caught up in the attention, no small task considering he already has been featured in Golf Digest because of his swing speed. Starting with his power display at Erin Hills, he already is mentioned in the same category with Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and the rest of the big hitters in golf.\n\nHe understands why he gets so much attention, though.\n\n\"That's kind of what our game's around right now \u2014 athletic players hit it far, and then once they learn how to hit wedges like DJ did, then the sky's the limit,\" he said. \"It doesn't bother me anymore. It never really bothered me before, but now with the attention, I just try to block it all out.\"\n\nHis goal when he earned his PGA Tour was to make all the cuts in the fall portion of the schedule, and he has done just that. The final stop is Sea Island, which starts Thursday on two courses (Seaside and Plantation) with a field that features Webb Simpson, Kevin Kisner, Zach Johnson and tournament host Davis Love III.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It produces the top television ratings across the country each year, has prime-time shows for things like schedule releases and fans come out in droves annually to see the future of the league at the draft.\n\nWhat football isn\u2019t, however, is the most popular sport in the world \u2013 not American football, at least. Soccer and even the NBA are miles ahead of the NFL in terms of worldwide popularity, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. They\u2019re both international sports with stars coming from all over the world, whereas the NFL typically gets its talent through colleges in the U.S.\n\nThe league isn\u2019t sitting on its hands and allowing other sports to take over the globe, however. It\u2019s taking a proactive approach by hosting a handful of games internationally each year. The three games in London last month went off without much of a hitch \u2013 Raiders-Seahawks was moved from the new Tottenham Stadium to Wembley Stadium in August \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t the case in Mexico City.\n\nAs announced Tuesday, the NFL is moving Monday night\u2019s showdown between the league-leading Rams and Chiefs from Estadio Azteca to the L.A. Memorial Coliseum because of terrible field conditions \u2013 the right decision, of course. Players threatened to sit out the game if it remained in Mexico City, essentially forcing the NFL\u2019s hand and leading to the relocation.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of revenue coming in each year for the league, but this will cost it a boatload of money, as well as plenty of embarrassment. This is a massive blunder for the NFL and Mexico City, regardless of which side is to blame.\n\nNFL moving on the game from Mexico to LA will cost the league tens of millions of dollars. It will cost Mexico even more if the unhinging of this game unlocks language in 2019, 2020 and 2021 game contract to allow the NFL to cancel future dates of games in country. \u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) November 13, 2018\n\nThe financial implications of this gaffe are troubling, but that\u2019s hardly the biggest issue coming out of this situation. The NFL had a golden opportunity with the 9-1 Rams and 9-1 Chiefs \u2013 a potential Super Bowl preview \u2013 playing on international soil.\n\nFans outside the U.S. have hardly been treated to exciting games. All five international games last year were decided by at least 17 points with an average margin of victory of 26.4 points. This year, the Seahawks beat the Raiders in London 27-3 before the Titans-Chargers and Eagles-Jaguars games were one-possession games.\n\nThis Rams-Chiefs matchup had the potential to be special. It comes with the largest over-under total in the history of the NFL at 63.5 with both teams averaging more than 33 points per game. It had the makings of a colossal win for the NFL when it comes to international games.\n\nInstead, the league has some decisions to make and reevaluating to do about future games outside the U.S., including the possibility of playing a game in China next year.\n\nThere\u2019s another game scheduled for Mexico City in 2019 and the deal to keep games there runs through 2021. Will this incident have any impact on that agreement? Maybe not, but Darren Rovell\u2019s above tweet seems to suggest it could.\n\nAfter all, the league has been talking about moving a team to either London or Mexico City. In no way does this stadium debacle help that case and it could create some pushback from players or other members of the organization.\n\nMany players and coaches already dread playing internationally because of the scheduling conflicts it creates, so it\u2019s not as if this will do anything to help those feelings.\n\nPredicting this situation was difficult for the league, but the warning signs were there. A Shakira concert on Oct. 11 left the field in poor condition, but that was hardly the only reason for this game being moved, as some are saying on Twitter.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the field after that event:\n\nLa cancha del Estadio Azteca luego del doble concierto de Shakira durante la Fecha FIFA. Si ya estaba en malas condiciones, la dejaron peor. El pasto h\u00edbrido ha sido un verdadero fiasco y el s\u00e1bado hay partido. \u00bfEstar\u00e1 lista para la Liguilla? \ud83e\udd14 \ud83d\udcf8 @Migue_luk pic.twitter.com/0Vv3ePcW4k \u2014 SoyReferee (@SoyReferee) October 16, 2018\n\nA concert for Telehit, a Mexican TV network, on Nov. 7 \u2013 just 12 days before Chiefs-Rams \u2013 did even greater damage to the playing surface.\n\nTake a look at the field after that show.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo lo ven? \ud83e\udd14 As\u00ed luce la cancha del Estadio Azteca despu\u00e9s de albergar otro concierto \ud83d\ude28 Y ma\u00f1ana tendremos el Cruz Azul vs Lobos BUAP \ud83d\ude30 \ud83d\udcf8 | @Migue_luk pic.twitter.com/hMszGIhUHL \u2014 DIARIO R\u00c9CORD (@record_mexico) November 9, 2018\n\nThen, to make matters even worse, a soccer match was played at Estadio Azteca on Nov. 10, which prevented the grounds crew from doing the necessary work to get the field up to standards. Even without that game it would\u2019ve been difficult, but that extra delay did nothing to help.\n\nThe league should have seen this schedule and raised a few flags. A surprisingly rainy season in the area was obviously impossible to account for, but those two concerts in succession made for a difficult ask \u2013 one the crew in Mexico City couldn\u2019t fulfill.\n\nLet this be a warning sign for the NFL when it comes to international games. It was a golden opportunity to bring a marquee game to foreign soil, but the league and the city fell flat on its face. While expanding the game around the world is a big priority \u2013 and for good reason \u2013 it does come with some risks, as we all saw this week."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Maeve McDermott, USA TODAY", "title": "Meg Ryan flashes engagement ring from John Mellencamp", "description": "Meg Ryan gave her engagement ring its red carpet debut Tuesday at the Friars Club in New York.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/14/meg-ryan-flashes-huge-engagement-ring-john-mellencamp/1998148002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0231a71795836b4ff555f4aa41a871f68d7aacde/c=0-23-1936-1117/local/-/media/2018/11/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636777225970773506-DIC13.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:50:44Z", "content": "It's International Kissing Day!

(Photo: DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 A large, drop-shaped natural pearl pendant sold for more than $36 million Wednesday at a rare auction of jewelry that once belonged to French Queen Marie Antoinette, which Sotheby's is calling a record price for a pearl at auction.\n\nThe \"Queen Marie Antoinette's Pearl,\" a diamond-and-pearl pendant, was among the highlight offerings on the block at the Sotheby's sale of jewelry from the Bourbon-Parma dynasty in Geneva.\n\nSotheby's billed the sale as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to scoop up heirlooms and jewels that have been held in the Bourbon-Parma dynasty for generations. Some of the Marie Antoinette jewelry hadn't been seen in public for 200 years \u2014 until now.\n\nLike many of the 10 former Marie Antoinette pieces up for sale, the pendant obliterated the pre-auction estimate \u2014 in its case, $1 million to $2 million. It sold for a hammer price of 32 million Swiss francs ($32 million), but with the buyer's premium and fees, the total sale rose to more than $36.1 million.\n\nThe buyer wanted to remain anonymous, the auction house said.\n\nAll told, the Marie Antoinette pieces reaped nearly $43 million.\n\nOne of the most important royal jewelry collections ever to come to auction comes for sale at Sothebys in Geneva on Nov. 14, 2018. Entitled Royal Jewels from the Bourbon-Parma Family, the auction will span centuries of European history, from the reign of Louis XVI to the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. (Photo: DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe diamond and pearl jewelry of Marie Antoinette that went under the hammer epitomized the aloof, pre-Revolutionary opulence of French royals brought down by the uprising. The wife of King Louis XVI, she was executed in France's revolutionary fervor in 1793.\n\nBefore falling to the guillotine, she had secretly smuggled abroad some of her most treasured possessions to her relatives amid rising the revolutionary fervor that ultimately marked the beginning of the end of France's centuries-old monarchy.\n\n\"The Marie Antoinette pendant is simply irreplaceable,\" Eddie LeVian, CEO of jewelers Le Vian, said before the sale. \"This is about far more than the gems themselves: Marie Antoinette's jewelry is inextricably linked to the cause of the French Revolution.\"\n\nThe queen's jewelry also included a set of pearl and diamond earrings, a diamond brooch, and a natural pearl and diamond necklace. A monogrammed, diamond-set ring bears a lock of Marie Antoinette's hair.\n\nNearly all of those lots far outstripped the pre-sale estimates, a testament to the difficulty in assessing the value of such rarely available jewels.\n\n\"It was really the Bourbon-Parma factor, plus certainly the Marie Antoinette factor,\" said Daniela Mascetti, Sotheby's chairman for jewelry in Europe. \"Prices really rocketed. Some items sold for, I think, 20 or 25 times more than the presale estimate.\"\n\nAdded Andres White Correns, senior director for jewelry: \"We had said when we did the press conference for this sale that this was going to be the sale of this century \u2014 and I think that the results tonight prove that this is the case.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/14/marie-antoinette-jewels-going-up-auction/1998203002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, William Cummings, USA TODAY", "title": "Trump tried to broker House leadership deal, promote loyalist Jim Jordan, report says", "description": "An ideological firebrand, Rep.

The specifics of the negotiations remain unclear, but the news site said lawmakers speculated that he would want Jordan to become the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, which is expected to open several investigations into the Trump administration when the Democrats take control.\n\n\"I think we\u2019re entering a world we haven\u2019t really seen,\" Jordan told reporters on Tuesday, listing the incoming Democratic chairmen who are poised to investigate Trump. \"It\u2019s going to take an attitude and an intensity about standing up for the truth and fighting.\"\n\nRep.

Some lawmakers suggested Jordan would be a better fit as the ranking member on the Oversight Committee where he is already next in line, Politico reported.\n\nJordan would likely lead a more combative and confrontational Republican minority than McCarthy, who is considered more affable and willing to compromise to reach bipartisan agreement.\n\nMcCarthy seemed confident as he headed into a closed-door meeting with House Republicans on Tuesday, where the lawmakers assessed their electoral defeats.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got a plan,\" McCarthy told reporters.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nMore: Reps.

He was ready to transition from winning championships to helping others. It never crossed his mind he could still be an athlete after college.\n\nHe was in the Crimson Tide\u2019s weight room when he found out Hendrick Motorsports had reached out to the reigning national champions\u2019 coaching staff, looking for athletes who worked hard but weren\u2019t headed for the NFL. The powerhouse NASCAR team wanted Harrell to come to their pit crew camp and try out.\n\nBut he had already shed his athlete mentality, and he didn\u2019t want to move to North Carolina and be that far from home. Plus, he was worried about not being a mechanic.\n\n\u201cI could change your brakes or your oil, but that\u2019s about it, and they said that\u2019s what they want,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care if you know anything about cars or racing.\u201d\n\nSo he reconsidered and joined HMS for a two-day tryout. To his surprise, he was physically tested like on the football field, only this time he was running with tires and jacks in his hands. Afterward, his body was sore in places that had never been sore before, and he realized this was an opportunity to remain a competitive athlete \u2014 a professional athlete \u2014 when he thought that part of his life was over.\n\n\u201cOnce I got up here and it all set in that, man, I\u2019m about to go compete for more championships, that\u2019s all I could ever ask for,\u201d said Harrell, who eventually became the tire carrier on the No. 88 Chevrolet for Dale Earnhardt Jr, and now Alex Bowman. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\n\nHarrell\u2019s story of transitioning to NASCAR pit crew member is a common one because for the last two decades, racing teams have been recruiting former college athletes \u2014 from football and baseball players to wrestlers \u2014 to work on their cars.\n\nIt\u2019s true that in the beginning, the teams don\u2019t care how much these athletes know about tuning up cars or even about NASCAR itself. They want an athletic and competitive mindset to match that of the drivers, and they\u2019ll teach them to run with and change tires.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t always the approach.\n\nIt used to be the best mechanics on each team were the ones on pit road, explained Andy Papathanassiou, HMS\u2019 director of human performance. It always made sense for the people who understood every inch of the car to be the ones adjusting it and changing tires during races.\n\nWhile working for HMS on Jeff Gordon\u2019s No. 24 Chevrolet team in the mid-1990s, Papathanassiou implemented what he describes as an over-the-wall philosophy, referencing the physical wall pit crew members climb over during a stop. Inspired by athletes, the strategy focuses on racing team members specializing on one job \u2014 or one position \u2014 like other professional athletes do to raise their collective level of performance.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a person that builds and maintains a race car and it\u2019s amazing the skills you have, it might not be the best use of your shop time to sit in front of a wheel and pull it off and put it on 20 times,\u201d said Papathanassiou, who played football at Stanford in the late \u201880s before HMS hired him in 1992 as a pit crew coach.\n\n\u201cBut when you\u2019re trying to get that process a tenth of a second faster, that\u2019s exactly what you need to do. And that\u2019s something that is very familiar in the athletic world \u2014 the practice and repetition down to the very minute details of whatever you\u2019re trying to improve in.\u201d\n\nThe @AxaltaRacing pit crew is getting warmed up for today\u2019s race! pic.twitter.com/r12v4twt0G \u2014 No. 88 Team (@Hendrick88Team) November 4, 2018\n\nGordon\u2019s team was the prototype in Papathanassiou\u2019s experiment, which led to consistently faster pit stops compared with the rest of the field. Aside from the future Hall of Fame driver\u2019s talent, something was clicking with the 24 team, which first led to the Cup Series championship in 1995, and then again in \u201897, \u201898 and 2001. Competing on the same track for more than 30 weekends a year, other teams caught on to the strategy \u2014 which HMS also implemented with all its cars \u2014 and began to recruit athletes for their own pit crews. It was a major paradigm shift in NASCAR that Papathanassiou is credited with initiating.\n\nTwenty years later, the pit departments for NASCAR\u2019s larger teams \u2014 like HMS, Joe Gibbs Racing, Team Penske and Stewart-Haas Racing \u2014 resemble universities\u2019 athletic departments. On top of pit crew and position coaches, teams have personal trainers, physical therapists, nutritionists, sports psychologists and sometimes orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors who work with the pit crews.\n\nAnd with so many resources and opportunities to offer, recruiting college athletes and convincing them to change sports isn\u2019t that hard of a sell. Pit crew coaches reach out to football, baseball, wrestling and hockey programs looking for dedicated, team players who aren\u2019t going pro, and then they make their pitch. Once pit crew members work their way up to full-time in the Cup Series, they can make between $80,000 and $200,000 a year, Phil Horton, the pit crew coach for Rev Racing and NASCAR\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, told The New York Times earlier this year.\n\nRelated The grueling life of a NASCAR pit crew member\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to allow you to reach your dream of being a professional athlete,\u201d Papathanassiou said. \u201cYou\u2019re athletically gifted, you think in that mindset. If we just apply it in the NASCAR world, it will make you valuable and successful as a professional athlete.\n\n\u201cAnd give them all the credit, they have to reinvent themselves. You play football your whole life, and now you have to risk all that to try and make it in the NASCAR world.\u201d\n\nWith a change in NASCAR\u2019s rules implemented in the beginning of the 2018 season, the number of pit crew members allowed over the wall during a stop dropped from six to five. In years prior, there was a fueler, a jackman, two tire carriers and two tire changers. With five crew members now, the fueler is only allowed to put gas in the car and can\u2019t take on any other pit-stop duties, while jacking up the car and carrying and changing tires is handled by the other four members with someone doubling up.\n\nIf it still seems like these are jobs for mechanics, a number of skills transfer from other sports, aside from the athletic mentality and knowing what it takes to train at an elite level. The little things \u2014 like agility, fast footwork, lightning reflexes, spatial awareness, peripheral vision and operating under pressure \u2014 are the most valuable, said Kellen Mills, who was the gasman for for Joey Logano and the No. 22 Ford team from 2014 through part of the 2018 season. He was also a defensive end for Arizona State from 2003 to 2007.\n\n\u201cTo the athletic side, you\u2019re doing something you\u2019ve never really done before, so you\u2019re learning a new skill,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long learning curve to really becoming proficient.\u201d\n\nWhile many pit crew members are former college \u2014 and sometimes high school \u2014 athletes, not all of them are. But multiple team members and coaches said the number of former college athletes on their rosters continues growing.\n\nTo remain competitive with the rest of the field, there\u2019s a minimum physical ability pit crews have to possess, especially for smaller teams trying to keep up with those with more resources, said Mike Metcalf, the pit crew trainer for Chip Ganassi Racing and fueler for Kyle Larson\u2019s No. 42 Chevrolet. Metcalf \u2014 who was a running back at Appalachian State for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 seasons \u2014 described his role on the two-car team as a player-coach.\n\n\u201cI need the runaround speeds to be under four seconds for a jackman, so as long as you can do that, you don\u2019t have to be an athlete,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cBut athletes tend to be able to do that quicker.\u201d\n\nLarger athletes, like former linemen or linebackers, are usually better suited to be tire carriers, jackmen and fuelers. Moving rapidly or even running into the pit box requires strength and balance because the tires weigh between 55 and 75 pounds, while the jack is about 35 pounds and the gascan holds 12 gallons, weighing about 95 pounds when full.\n\nFor many of the former football players, modifying their in-competition mindset was one of the biggest challenges, aside from learning how to make adjustments to a car in 12 to 15 seconds.\n\n\u201cYou come from football where you have to go out there and hit another guy in the mouth, and you have to make sure you\u2019re angry all the time and get yourself hyped up,\u201d said John Gianninoto, the fueler for Chase Elliott\u2019s No. 9 Chevrolet who played center for UNLV from 2007 to 2010.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found in this sport, if you do decide to get really amped up before a pit stop, you actually make more mistakes. So you have to stay even-keeled and just let your body takeover with muscle memory.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of the pit crew, the tire changers are typically agile athletes who are flexible and good with their hands, such as wide receivers, baseball infielders or pitchers, like Calvin Teague, who was a reliever for Appalachian State in the 2006, 2007 and 2008 seasons and is now the rear tire changer on Jimmie Johnson\u2019s No. 48 Chevrolet.\n\nComing from a highly individual role, like pitching, or for those from individual sports, like wrestling, the mentality actually transfers over almost seamlessly, said Teague, who joined the 48 team in 2010, helping Johnson win three of his record-tying seven Cup Series championships. He explained that his pitcher\u2019s disposition is something he references the most on pit road.\n\n\u201cIf I get on the mound and throw a pitch right down the middle and the guy hits a home run, I have to turn right back around within seconds and pitch to a different batter,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this, if I make a mistake, I have to turn right back around because Jimmie\u2019s going to come back. You\u2019re dealing with tenths of seconds and trying to go as fast as you can.\u201d\n\nDespite the perception that NASCAR is an individual sport because the driver receives a lopsided amount of attention compared with the pit crew, the team element is part of the competition former college athletes are all too familiar with. They know how to push each other in practice, galvanize each other on pit road and encourage the newcomers who are just beginning to reinvent themselves in a new sport. The veterans know exactly what that\u2019s like.\n\nWith little room for error, the time for a strong pit stop has shifted to about 12 seconds, up from 10, following NASCAR\u2019s rule change about the number of crew members allowed over the wall.\n\nAnd, as Papathanassiou said, pit stop times are tracking the slowest position\u2019s time, and the difference between a fast stop and the fastest stop can determine who wins the race \u2013 and, subsequently, who qualifies for or advances through the playoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our best performer that sets our level of performance for the day; it\u2019s actually our weakest link,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a different mentality versus other sports, where you can really go after things harder and rely on key people to bring everyone else along. We\u2019re successful in the complete opposite way.\u201d\n\nCountless people work on the cars throughout the week and in the offseason at the teams\u2019 shops, which are mostly in North Carolina. But on race day, they function like a football team with the driver leading on the track, the crew chief calling the shots and the pit crew making fast and small adjustments to pick up tenths of a second and get off pit road the fastest.\n\nLike on Sunday at the Cup Series finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, when a championship or race is won, the pit crew celebrates with the driver in Victory Lane.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nFinding the right skincare, beauty, and haircare can be difficult\u2014but choosing and buying these things for someone else is downright daunting (just ask anyone who's stopped into Sephora on behalf of a S.O.)\n\nBut the holiday season is actually the best time to snag makeup and beauty products, thanks to stacked gift sets loaded with products at a fraction of their normal selling price: and they make fantastic gifts. To help demystify things, we've sifted through the seasonal offerings to find the best beauty, skincare, and hair care gifts of 2018.\n\nOur comprehensive list has something for every type of person in your life, from your indecisive coworker, to your pal with envy-inducing hair, to the friend who has everything, to the one who could use some R+R. Without further delay, here are the best beauty gifts of 2018, according to Reviewed:\n\n1. For the one who's hard to shop for: A collection of Sephora's best-sellers\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Sephora)\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen a gift set this stacked in years. It\u2019s packed with 11 of Sephora's best-sellers, including a full-sized Anastasia brow pencil, Becca highlighter, Urban Decay eyeliner, and two makeup primers. Unlike a lot of gift sets with filler items, there's really no weak link in this one: they're all great products. Look for brands like Kat Von D, Smashbox, Too Faced, Stila, Dior\u2014at a great value. It's perfect for the person who has it all, or the one for whom you don't know what to buy.\n\nGet The Sephora Superstars Kit at Sephora for $75\n\n2. For the trend-seeker (and setter): A popular Sunday Riley gift set\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Dermstore)\n\nSunday Riley is a favorite among fresh-faced beauty bloggers and beauty veterans (even Oprah loves the stuff, calling it her \u201cgo-to beauty regimen\u201d). The Holiday Trio ($142) set comes with full sizes of Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment, U.F.O. Ultra-Clarifying Acne Treatment Face Oil, and Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser for truly smoother, brighter skin.\n\nNot ready to commit (or fully splurge) on the brand? In that case, we recommend the Face to Face Kit ($49), a great value with four trial-sized bottles of their must-have cleanser and Good Genes treatment, as well as C.E.O. Rapid Flash Brightening Serum and Tidal Brightening Enzyme Water Cream.\n\n3. For the one who goes broke on blowouts: A great deal on the best hair dryer\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Dermstore)\n\nIf she's a regular at the salon, it's probably time to gift her a quality hair dryer. Harry Josh makes the best hair dryer you can buy\u2014but this might be the most amazing deal we\u2019ve ever seen on the mint green powerhouse. The Harry Josh Pro Tools hair dryer typically retails for $250 by itself, but in this kit, you get the dryer and its attachments as well as Serge Normant Dream Big Instant Volumizing shampoo, conditioner, and spray\u2014all for $189. You'd be hair-brained to pass this up.\n\nGet Harry Josh Pro Tools x Serge Normant Kit at Dermstore for $189\n\n4. For the well-groomed guy: Essentials for him\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Ulta)\n\nIt's 2018, and we should know (or at least have a hunch) that skincare and self care are not just for women. Gently let your dude friends know that it's time to start (or continue!) moisturizing and grooming.\n\nUlta's Grooming Essentials For Him ($30) is a great pick to cover all the bases. It features a variety of cleansers, shaving creams, and moisturizers by favorite brands including Jack Black, Clinique, Mario Badescu, and David Beckham. For the sensitive-skinned man on your list, a set of gentle skincare by Kiehl\u2019s ($49) is also great.\n\n5. For the one who always complains about her skin: Skincare from Peter Thomas Roth\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Dermstore)\n\nPeter Thomas Roth is an industry favorite for skincare, thanks to clinical strength products that prevent and correct skin issues. The products are sure to please even your pickiest pal. The Power Players 5-piece kit ($38) covers every step of a good skincare regimen: an anti-aging cleanser, a purifying mud mask, peel pads to smooth fine lines, a night serum loaded with retinol, and a moisturizer packed with hyaluronic acid. The combination purges pores of toxins and grime, and gives a burst of intense hydration.\n\nSpeaking of hyaluronic acid: PTR's Water Drench line is perfect for anyone with dry, sensitive skin. Get Drenched ($52), includes a moisturizing cleanser, serum, and moisturizer that attracts and retains up to 1,000 times its weight in water, banishing dryness. I swear by it.\n\n6. For the glow-getter: An array of luminous highlighters\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Sephora)\n\nA good highlighter is worth its weight in gold.

For the burgeoning makeup addict: A Benefit gift set\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Benefit)\n\nBenefit's cutesy branding is perfect for makeup newbies, but don't let the punny names and packaging fool you: They make some of the best makeup on the market. Benefit has a lot of great gift sets out this year, but IMO, this is the best one, since it includes full-sized, iconic products.\n\nRoller Lash mascara curls, lengthens, and lifts lashes; the POREfessional Face Primer blurs pores and smooths complexion; cult classic Hoola Matte Bronzer is the perfect contouring powder; and High Beam Liquid Highlighter gives a subtle and satiny glow. It's great as a starter set, but any makeup vet would be delighted by these picks, too.\n\nGet Benefit Gimme Some Sugar Limited-Edition Value Set at Ulta for $44\n\n10. For the one with sensitive skin: A calming skincare routine by First Aid Beauty\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Dermstore)\n\nMy skin is so laughably sensitive that I pretty much have to wear mittens like a newborn to prevent irritating it. That being said, First Aid Beauty makes products that calm my angry skin. They're infused with nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and colloidal oatmeal. The brand has tons of gift sets out this year, but this kit is the most comprehensive\u2014and has the best array of must-haves.\n\nA gentle face cleanser removes impurities, and Facial Radiance Pads resurface and brighten. The Ultra Repair Hydrating Serum is perfect to layer beneath the thick, hydrating Ultra Repair Cream. Finish off with Ultra Repair Intensive Lip Balm to battle aging, uneven pigmentation, eczema, dehydrated skin, and chapped lips\u2014all winter long.\n\nGet First Aid Beauty FAB Beautique set at Dermstore for $48\n\n11. For the indecisive one: An expansive set of mascara\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Sephora)\n\nYou know you can't rely on this friend to pick a restaurant or commit to a hair color\u2014but you can bet she'll love the plentiful options in this gift set. Lashstash ($48) has 10 mascaras with new and best-selling formulas that stretch, volumize, and curl lashes. Look for cult favorites from Benefit and Too Faced, as well as Dior, Lanc\u00f4me, and more. Even though she can't decide on many things, one thing's for sure: she probably wants long, curled, luscious lashes.\n\nGet Lashstash for $48 from Sephora\n\n12. For the one who's always masking: An array of top-selling face masks\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Sephora)\n\nSubtly let her know you've received all those #SelfCareSunday selfies with a set of face masks.

A collection of clay, gel, and sheet formulas from Dr.Jart+, Kiehl\u2019s, Origins, GlamGlow, and more will draw out oil, dirt, and toxins.\n\nAlternatively, Peter Thomas Roth's the Mask Mashup ($25) has six types of face masks to address pretty much any skin concern, from fine lines to redness to dryness and environmental damage.

For your beloved lipstick addict, Give Me More Lip is perfect. The gift set has 14 lipsticks from brands Anastasia (our top-rated liquid lipstick!), Huda, Kat Von D, Nars, and more\u2014in an array of liquid, gloss, and solid formulas in deep ruby reds to barely-there nude tones.\n\nGet Give Me More Lip at Sephora for $68\n\n14. For the one who treats makeup as an art: A great 10-piece brush set\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThis year, Oprah included a $360 makeup brush set on her Favorite Things of 2018 list. Yikes\u2014good makeup brushes are wonderful, but can be a waste of money. Lucky for you(r wallet), Yoseng also makes a set of 10 brushes, but for a fraction of the price, and with the same large, flat surface that allows for easy makeup distribution and even coverage\u2014and 1.5k five-star ratings on Amazon is always a good sign.\n\nGet Yoseng 10-Piece Makeup Brush Set at Amazon for $13\n\n15.

Its F\u2026 [+4412 chars]", "fulltext": "Amazon's Fire TV Recast re-imagines the way you think of as DVR\n\nCLOSE USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham gives the pros and cons on the new Amazon Amazon Fire TV Recast, a DVR over-the-air television. USA TODAY\n\nThe DVR has always been a tool to record TV shows and play them back, to watch on the television. Amazon changes that.\n\nIts Fire TV Recast DVR, out Nov. 14, will re-imagine how you think of a DVR. Yes, it can record TV shows, but only if connected to an antenna. Reader alert: Cable and satellite customers will find the Recast useless. It's for cord-cutters only.\n\nOnce connected, the Recast acts as the TV hub that receives the signal and re-distributes it, along with the recorded shows, to multiple TV sets, your phone and tablet.\n\nStarting at $229, the Recast is about the lowest-priced, full-service DVR that's been available to date, and highlighted by one magic consumer advantage \u2013 no monthly fee. Most cable services charge a monthly rental for their DVRs to the tune of $30 or so, and rival TiVo has a host of DVRs available, with monthly fees of anywhere from $6.99 to $15.\n\nAmazon makes cutting the cord more attractive with their new Amazon Fire TV Recast. It is a DVR for over-the-air television. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USAT)\n\nSo what is it?\n\nThe Recast works only with Amazon products. There's the Fire TV Edition of television sets, which start at around $229.Though, many retailers will discount them to just over $100 with Black Friday deals. You could also use an Amazon Fire TV Stick ($30-$50) streaming device in any TV with an HDMI port or the Echo Show, the $229 edition of the talking speaker that brings video to Alexa. Additionally, you'll need to add an antenna at a cost of $30 or more.\n\nBeyond having a tool to record local news and sports and broadcast shows (most of which are readily available via apps), the twist is that the Recast has Alexa built in, so you just say, \"Alexa, record 'The Price is Right',\" or \"...Tune to NBC.\"\n\nAgain, the Recast isn't just a DVR, but a box that has taken over your TV set. You use it to find out what's on, to turn to a specific station, view the channel guide, record, and monitor your recorded shows. (Second reader alert: During setup, you plug the antenna into the Recast and not a TV.)\n\nIf you use a Fire Stick in multiple TVs throughout your home, you can tap into shows recorded on the Recast, wherever it actually sits, and even watch live TV, via a DVR tab that shows up in the Amazon TV menu.\n\nFor cord cutters, other choices of devices to record and playback TV shows are slim. There's the new TiVo, the Bolt OTA, which sells for $249.99 plus $6.99 monthly, or the Tablo, which has several models available, selling for $139 to $199. But you'll need to spring for a hard drive to connect to it, so add $75 to $100. Like the Recast, Tablo and the Bolt connect only to antennas, not cable or satellite boxes.\n\nSo how is the Recast?\n\nFirst, props to Amazon for re-imagining how we watch TV.\n\nThat said, setup can take some time (remember, antenna into the unit, not the TV), and it's different experience that may take getting used to.\n\nOnce it's up and running, it records and finds shows, although not as smoothly as with the cable DVR, which to my eyes does a more pleasing job of zipping through commercials visually than the Recast. But then again, I'm paying over $400 yearly for this right in DVR rentals from my cable company. I love paying once with no monthly fees.\n\nOne more caveat: When so much programming is available via streaming, in movies, original TV shows and the like, and when YouTube offers the best of broadcast TV (and so much more in clip form) it's questionable whether any of us actually need to record anything.\n\nBut then, I'm not a fan of \"The Bachelor,\" so what do I know?\n\nAnother note: Because Amazon and Google don't get along, the official YouTube app isn't included in the Amazon offerings. But Amazon has a workaround to pick up YouTube via a browser.\n\nPro: Low price, unique twist on TV viewing, no monthly fee. Starts at $229 with ability to record up to four shows at once on 500 GB hard drive, or $279 for 1 TB hard drive.\n\nCon: Works only with Amazon products, so if you get Amazon Prime Video via the Roku streaming stick, you'd need to spring for Amazon's brand. You're also missing out on the cable alternative YouTube TV, which won't work with Recast. Fast forward not as visually appealing and precise as the cable DVR.\n\nReaders: Would you ditch your cable DVR for a unit that works only with an antenna?

USA TODAY\n\nAmazonBasics Microwave (Photo: Amazon)\n\n\u201cAlexa, microwave 6 ounces of oatmeal.\u201d \u201cAlexa, nuke peas for 30 seconds.\u201d \u201cAlexa reheat one cup of coffee.\u201d\n\nOK, so perhaps Alexa isn\u2019t exactly America\u2019s top chef. But Amazon\u2019s digital assistant does assume the role of a vocally-driven kitchen helper as you reheat a plate, defrost foods and otherwise prepare a meal with the previously announced but just now available AmazonBasics Microwave. I\u2019ve been cooking with it for a couple of days and find the $59.99 price \u2013 and to some degree the use of voice \u2013 appetizing.\n\nAs with any other compact countertop microwave, you can press on a keypad to choose power levels \u2013 there are 10 \u2013 or the length of time you\u2019ll be nuking the item you\u2019ve placed inside.\n\nBut where\u2019s the fun in that when you can get Alexa to do everything at your behest?\n\nAnd to get serious for a second, a voice-controlled, Wi-Fi microwave is not only convenient, but it might benefit those of you who are blind or have low vision.\n\nUsing preset voice instructions\n\nThere\u2019s one key requirement to keep in mind however: You will need to pair the microwave with a nearby Echo speaker, lest you're left with a basic 700-watt microwave that's more or less like any other, with standard features such as turntable, child lock and kitchen timer.\n\nMore: Amazon connects digital assistant Alexa to microwave, clock and car\n\nI paired the microwave with an Echo Show in my tests, and, it's important to note that even when the microwave is in the middle of cooking something, you can still ask Alexa to play music, deliver the weather or handle other queries on your Echo device.\n\nFollowing a relatively simple setup through the Alexa app on my phone \u2013 after plugging the microwave into the wall, I received a notification that it was found \u2013 you can bark commands out loud to the microwave (via the Echo Show) with the familiar Alexa \u201cwake word.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa, microwave one corn on the cob,\u201d for instance.\n\nAlternatively, if you\u2019re standing in front of the microwave, you can press a dedicated \u201cAsk Alexa\u201d button before telling it what you want the microwave to do. In that case, you would just say, \u201cone corn on the cob.\u201d\n\nOnce cooking, you can also use your voice to pause or stop the microwave.\n\nAmazon supplies a number of quick cook preset voice instructions, and as I found in my tests, you\u2019ll want to follow those instructions, at least at this point, closely. When I issued the command, \u201cAlexa, reheat my coffee,\u201d the response I got on the Echo Show was, \u201cwhat\u2019s the volume of coffee?\u201d When I followed with \u201cAlexa, reheat one cup of coffee,\u201d the microwave kicked into action.\n\nAmazon explains that the microwave does not have built-in sensors to detect the weight or volume of whatever it is you would want to cook, so when using such presets for liquids, specify the volume (yes, \u201cone cup of coffee\u201d), and when using solids, specify the quantity or weight (\u201c6 ounces of rice\u201d).\n\nNuking a muffin in the AmazonBasics Microwave. (Photo: Edward C. baig)\n\nA snag: During a couple of tries, the microwave failed to comply when I asked, \u201cAlexa to microwave two potatoes,\u201d though you\u2019re supposed to be able to tell it to microwave between one and four potatoes. When I asked Alexa to instead microwave one potato, the machine did as told. (In another attempt, later on, the two-potato command did work).\n\nIn the single potato example, the microwave started cooked for 6\u00bd minutes; as it turned out, I had to extend the time by two minutes before it was to my liking. To be fair, almost every microwave I\u2019ve ever used has some degree of trial and error.\n\nKeeping what you cook private\n\nAmazon says it will learn over time the kind of commands Alexa gets from customers and the foods people attempt to nuke to smarten up Alexa\u2019s instructions for the microwave.\n\nThe company insists that in gathering such data your own preferences will remain anonymous; it promises not to violate your privacy and start sending you ads for soup, say, if you\u2019re constantly looking to heat up soup in the microwave.\n\nYou can order popcorn through Amazon's Dash Replenishment program through the AmazonBasics Microwave. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThat said, there is at least one shopping play in the form of a dedicated popcorn button on the microwave that lets you automatically reorder your supply through Amazon\u2019s Dash Replenishment technology. You must opt into the program. If you do want to order popcorn, you choose the pack size during setup.\n\nAmazon hasn\u2019t announced other products you can order through the Dash program on the microwave, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge leap of faith to expect that more are in the pipeline. Remember, Amazon now owns Whole Foods.\n\nOne other possibility I can envision down the road is a tie-in somehow to an Echo such as the Show that has a screen \u2013 you might see recipes on that display for the microwave.\n\nThe microwave is also Amazon\u2019s first built using Alexa Connect Kit, a pitch to developers to easily build Alexa-connected devices.\n\nFor all the years that microwaves have been around, some are still more complicated than they need to be. Alexa may help some in that regard, though you still may find yourself resorting to old habits and pressing the keypad. There\u2019s not yet an Alexa robot to either place food in the microwave or take it out, so you\u2019re going to more often than not be right in front of the thing anyway.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com ; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2018/11/14/amazon-microwave-review-alexa-nuke-popcorn-heat-up-coffee/1986404002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY", "title": "Uber Rewards gives ride discounts, no surge pricing and other perks to frequent riders", "description": "Uber's new program will give plenty of perks to frequent riders of its service, including discounts, faster airport pickup and ride upgrades.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/14/uber-rewards-gives-ride-discounts-and-other-perks-frequent-riders/1989902002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/13/USAT/477e7cd1-8fbc-4a47-8b68-783ecaecb914-UberRewards-Hub-newsRoom-800x1410.jpg?crop=799,451,x0,y196&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:00:07Z", "content": "Uber Rewards screen.

(Photo: Uber)\n\nIf you use Uber frequently, you'll soon be rewarded for your rides.\n\nThe ride-sharing company is launching a new Uber Rewards program Wednesday that will provide perks to riders for using its service. Available first in nine cities in the U.S. before rolling out to all U.S. riders over the coming months, the program is similar to the company's recently announced rewards program for drivers.\n\nOn the list of initial launch cities: Miami; Denver; Tampa, Florida; New York; Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia; Atlanta; San Diego; and parts of New Jersey.\n\nThe program, which has been in the works for roughly a year, \"started from the premise that Uber today is really different than Uber from 10 years ago or eight years ago,\" says Nundu Janakiram, Uber's director of product for rider experience.\n\n\"What we've found is that Uber is now this thing that people use every day, and we wanted to find a way to reward our customers who choose Uber every day and build a relationship with them.\"\n\nAs with the driver program, Uber's rider rewards will dish out points depending on which Uber service is used, with the points unlocking different levels and the levels opening up perks. Among the notable rewards: discounts on future rides, better customer support and priority pickup at airports.\n\nUberPool and Uber Eats orders will earn you one point per dollar spent while UberX, XL, Select and WAV will get you two points per dollar. Users of the company's luxury Black and Black SUV services will earn three points per dollar spent.\n\nJanakiram says the company will be adding points for using bikes and scooters in the future.\n\nPoints can be earned regardless of whether the rider is using Uber for personal or business or if they are using Uber gift cards, though there is no additional perk for using Uber's Visa credit card.\n\nFour levels, each with different perks\n\nThe points will go toward placing you in one of four tiers \u2013 Blue, Gold, Platinum and Diamond \u2013 that will determine what perks you are eligible for. Blue is the standard level, with every 500 points netting you $5 in Uber Cash, the company's virtual currency that can be used to pay for Uber rides or Uber Eats deliveries. Using Uber Cash also earns you points.\n\nYou will earn $5 for every 500 points you accrue regardless of which tier you are in. Progress can be tracked through the Uber app, which is being updated alongside this launch.\n\nUber Rewards Gold members can have their cancellation fees refunded if they order within 15 minutes of canceling. (Photo: Uber)\n\nAfter your first 500 points are earned, you'll be bumped up to Gold, which will get you faster customer support plus the ability to cancel an Uber ride and get the cancellation fee refunded so long as a new ride is ordered within 15 minutes of canceling. (This does not apply to UberPool or Uber Express Pool orders.)\n\nOnce you accrue 2,500 points, you'll be elevated to Platinum, adding in perks like priority pickup to help lower wait times at \"most airports\" around the country, though Uber says this may take a couple of months to fully roll out.\n\nYou also will be able to get \"price protection\" on a particular route of your choosing, allowing you to lock in a set rate for an UberX ride. The rate would be for either direction and won't be impacted by surge pricing caused by traffic or if the ride is taken during the busiest times of the day.\n\nUber Rewards allows for price protection on a specific route. (Photo: Uber)\n\nUnlike the company's Ride Pass service, this perk only protects one particular route and not all rides, though you can change it once per month.\n\nAt 7,500 points, you will reach the Diamond level, granting you all the prior perks plus dedicated phone support (something regular Uber users rarely have access to) and an \"UberX Diamond\" option in the app that will pair you with higher rated drivers on your UberX trips.\n\nDiamond members will also receive waived delivery fees on up to three Uber Eats orders every six months and free \"surprise\" upgrades from UberX to Uber Black.\n\nUber will be covering the cost of the difference between X and Black rides and will also be covering the cancellation fees it refunds to ensure drivers still get paid.\n\n\"We consider it an investment from Uber,\" says Janakiram. \"It's not drivers paying for Uber Rewards, it is Uber that's investing in our customers.\"\n\nPoints are accrued during six month periods, with the perks you unlock available for the rest of that period plus the following six months. Points do not roll over from one period to the next.\n\nThere is no cost to sign up for Rewards, though you will need to opt into it. In a bid to get people more aware of the program, Uber is letting users start at a higher tier by counting all of your rides and food orders from the six-month period prior to your signing up.\n\nThe latest battleground with Lyft\n\nRewards are just the latest battleground between Uber and chief rival Lyft, which announced a rewards program of its own earlier this week called Lyft Rewards.\n\nAt this point, however, few details are known about Lyft's program, though it will offer occasional savings on future rides and upgrades to more premium vehicles. Like Uber, Lyft's rewards program will be available in its app.\n\nLyft says that it will be testing the service for \"select riders in various cities\" starting in December before expanding the program in 2019.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/14/uber-rewards-gives-ride-discounts-and-other-perks-frequent-riders/1989902002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "Christmas tree time!

He was ready to transition from winning championships to helping others. It never crossed his mind he could still be an athlete after college.\n\nHe was in the Crimson Tide\u2019s weight room when he found out Hendrick Motorsports had reached out to the reigning national champions\u2019 coaching staff, looking for athletes who worked hard but weren\u2019t headed for the NFL. The powerhouse NASCAR team wanted Harrell to come to their pit crew camp and try out.\n\nBut he had already shed his athlete mentality, and he didn\u2019t want to move to North Carolina and be that far from home. Plus, he was worried about not being a mechanic.\n\n\u201cI could change your brakes or your oil, but that\u2019s about it, and they said that\u2019s what they want,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care if you know anything about cars or racing.\u201d\n\nSo he reconsidered and joined HMS for a two-day tryout. To his surprise, he was physically tested like on the football field, only this time he was running with tires and jacks in his hands. Afterward, his body was sore in places that had never been sore before, and he realized this was an opportunity to remain a competitive athlete \u2014 a professional athlete \u2014 when he thought that part of his life was over.\n\n\u201cOnce I got up here and it all set in that, man, I\u2019m about to go compete for more championships, that\u2019s all I could ever ask for,\u201d said Harrell, who eventually became the tire carrier on the No. 88 Chevrolet for Dale Earnhardt Jr, and now Alex Bowman. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\n\nHarrell\u2019s story of transitioning to NASCAR pit crew member is a common one because for the last two decades, racing teams have been recruiting former college athletes \u2014 from football and baseball players to wrestlers \u2014 to work on their cars.\n\nIt\u2019s true that in the beginning, the teams don\u2019t care how much these athletes know about tuning up cars or even about NASCAR itself. They want an athletic and competitive mindset to match that of the drivers, and they\u2019ll teach them to run with and change tires.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t always the approach.\n\nIt used to be the best mechanics on each team were the ones on pit road, explained Andy Papathanassiou, HMS\u2019 director of human performance. It always made sense for the people who understood every inch of the car to be the ones adjusting it and changing tires during races.\n\nWhile working for HMS on Jeff Gordon\u2019s No. 24 Chevrolet team in the mid-1990s, Papathanassiou implemented what he describes as an over-the-wall philosophy, referencing the physical wall pit crew members climb over during a stop. Inspired by athletes, the strategy focuses on racing team members specializing on one job \u2014 or one position \u2014 like other professional athletes do to raise their collective level of performance.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a person that builds and maintains a race car and it\u2019s amazing the skills you have, it might not be the best use of your shop time to sit in front of a wheel and pull it off and put it on 20 times,\u201d said Papathanassiou, who played football at Stanford in the late \u201880s before HMS hired him in 1992 as a pit crew coach.\n\n\u201cBut when you\u2019re trying to get that process a tenth of a second faster, that\u2019s exactly what you need to do. And that\u2019s something that is very familiar in the athletic world \u2014 the practice and repetition down to the very minute details of whatever you\u2019re trying to improve in.\u201d\n\nThe @AxaltaRacing pit crew is getting warmed up for today\u2019s race! pic.twitter.com/r12v4twt0G \u2014 No. 88 Team (@Hendrick88Team) November 4, 2018\n\nGordon\u2019s team was the prototype in Papathanassiou\u2019s experiment, which led to consistently faster pit stops compared with the rest of the field. Aside from the future Hall of Fame driver\u2019s talent, something was clicking with the 24 team, which first led to the Cup Series championship in 1995, and then again in \u201897, \u201898 and 2001. Competing on the same track for more than 30 weekends a year, other teams caught on to the strategy \u2014 which HMS also implemented with all its cars \u2014 and began to recruit athletes for their own pit crews. It was a major paradigm shift in NASCAR that Papathanassiou is credited with initiating.\n\nTwenty years later, the pit departments for NASCAR\u2019s larger teams \u2014 like HMS, Joe Gibbs Racing, Team Penske and Stewart-Haas Racing \u2014 resemble universities\u2019 athletic departments. On top of pit crew and position coaches, teams have personal trainers, physical therapists, nutritionists, sports psychologists and sometimes orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors who work with the pit crews.\n\nAnd with so many resources and opportunities to offer, recruiting college athletes and convincing them to change sports isn\u2019t that hard of a sell. Pit crew coaches reach out to football, baseball, wrestling and hockey programs looking for dedicated, team players who aren\u2019t going pro, and then they make their pitch. Once pit crew members work their way up to full-time in the Cup Series, they can make between $80,000 and $200,000 a year, Phil Horton, the pit crew coach for Rev Racing and NASCAR\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, told The New York Times earlier this year.\n\nRelated The grueling life of a NASCAR pit crew member\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to allow you to reach your dream of being a professional athlete,\u201d Papathanassiou said. \u201cYou\u2019re athletically gifted, you think in that mindset. If we just apply it in the NASCAR world, it will make you valuable and successful as a professional athlete.\n\n\u201cAnd give them all the credit, they have to reinvent themselves. You play football your whole life, and now you have to risk all that to try and make it in the NASCAR world.\u201d\n\nWith a change in NASCAR\u2019s rules implemented in the beginning of the 2018 season, the number of pit crew members allowed over the wall during a stop dropped from six to five. In years prior, there was a fueler, a jackman, two tire carriers and two tire changers. With five crew members now, the fueler is only allowed to put gas in the car and can\u2019t take on any other pit-stop duties, while jacking up the car and carrying and changing tires is handled by the other four members with someone doubling up.\n\nIf it still seems like these are jobs for mechanics, a number of skills transfer from other sports, aside from the athletic mentality and knowing what it takes to train at an elite level. The little things \u2014 like agility, fast footwork, lightning reflexes, spatial awareness, peripheral vision and operating under pressure \u2014 are the most valuable, said Kellen Mills, who was the gasman for for Joey Logano and the No. 22 Ford team from 2014 through part of the 2018 season. He was also a defensive end for Arizona State from 2003 to 2007.\n\n\u201cTo the athletic side, you\u2019re doing something you\u2019ve never really done before, so you\u2019re learning a new skill,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long learning curve to really becoming proficient.\u201d\n\nWhile many pit crew members are former college \u2014 and sometimes high school \u2014 athletes, not all of them are. But multiple team members and coaches said the number of former college athletes on their rosters continues growing.\n\nTo remain competitive with the rest of the field, there\u2019s a minimum physical ability pit crews have to possess, especially for smaller teams trying to keep up with those with more resources, said Mike Metcalf, the pit crew trainer for Chip Ganassi Racing and fueler for Kyle Larson\u2019s No. 42 Chevrolet. Metcalf \u2014 who was a running back at Appalachian State for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 seasons \u2014 described his role on the two-car team as a player-coach.\n\n\u201cI need the runaround speeds to be under four seconds for a jackman, so as long as you can do that, you don\u2019t have to be an athlete,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cBut athletes tend to be able to do that quicker.\u201d\n\nLarger athletes, like former linemen or linebackers, are usually better suited to be tire carriers, jackmen and fuelers. Moving rapidly or even running into the pit box requires strength and balance because the tires weigh between 55 and 75 pounds, while the jack is about 35 pounds and the gascan holds 12 gallons, weighing about 95 pounds when full.\n\nFor many of the former football players, modifying their in-competition mindset was one of the biggest challenges, aside from learning how to make adjustments to a car in 12 to 15 seconds.\n\n\u201cYou come from football where you have to go out there and hit another guy in the mouth, and you have to make sure you\u2019re angry all the time and get yourself hyped up,\u201d said John Gianninoto, the fueler for Chase Elliott\u2019s No. 9 Chevrolet who played center for UNLV from 2007 to 2010.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found in this sport, if you do decide to get really amped up before a pit stop, you actually make more mistakes. So you have to stay even-keeled and just let your body takeover with muscle memory.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of the pit crew, the tire changers are typically agile athletes who are flexible and good with their hands, such as wide receivers, baseball infielders or pitchers, like Calvin Teague, who was a reliever for Appalachian State in the 2006, 2007 and 2008 seasons and is now the rear tire changer on Jimmie Johnson\u2019s No. 48 Chevrolet.\n\nComing from a highly individual role, like pitching, or for those from individual sports, like wrestling, the mentality actually transfers over almost seamlessly, said Teague, who joined the 48 team in 2010, helping Johnson win three of his record-tying seven Cup Series championships. He explained that his pitcher\u2019s disposition is something he references the most on pit road.\n\n\u201cIf I get on the mound and throw a pitch right down the middle and the guy hits a home run, I have to turn right back around within seconds and pitch to a different batter,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this, if I make a mistake, I have to turn right back around because Jimmie\u2019s going to come back. You\u2019re dealing with tenths of seconds and trying to go as fast as you can.\u201d\n\nDespite the perception that NASCAR is an individual sport because the driver receives a lopsided amount of attention compared with the pit crew, the team element is part of the competition former college athletes are all too familiar with. They know how to push each other in practice, galvanize each other on pit road and encourage the newcomers who are just beginning to reinvent themselves in a new sport. The veterans know exactly what that\u2019s like.\n\nWith little room for error, the time for a strong pit stop has shifted to about 12 seconds, up from 10, following NASCAR\u2019s rule change about the number of crew members allowed over the wall.\n\nAnd, as Papathanassiou said, pit stop times are tracking the slowest position\u2019s time, and the difference between a fast stop and the fastest stop can determine who wins the race \u2013 and, subsequently, who qualifies for or advances through the playoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our best performer that sets our level of performance for the day; it\u2019s actually our weakest link,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a different mentality versus other sports, where you can really go after things harder and rely on key people to bring everyone else along. We\u2019re successful in the complete opposite way.\u201d\n\nCountless people work on the cars throughout the week and in the offseason at the teams\u2019 shops, which are mostly in North Carolina. But on race day, they function like a football team with the driver leading on the track, the crew chief calling the shots and the pit crew making fast and small adjustments to pick up tenths of a second and get off pit road the fastest.\n\nLike on Sunday at the Cup Series finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, when a championship or race is won, the pit crew celebrates with the driver in Victory Lane. They\u2019re still soaked in champagne \u2014 or Gatorade, Miller Lite, Mountain Dew or whatever the team sponsor\u2019s chosen beverage is \u2014 and in most of the glory photos. The driver is always the center of attention \u2014 though he routinely thanks his team and pit crew for their work \u2014 but for many of these former college athletes, it\u2019s nothing new.\n\n\u201cThink about being an offensive lineman,\u201d said Landon Walker, the fueler for William Byron\u2019s No. 24 Chevrolet team who was an offensive tackle at Clemson from 2008 to 2011. \u201cIf you have a good weekend, usually the running backs or quarterbacks are the ones in the paper.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to that, and I think you develop your character around being an unsung hero because I love it. I don\u2019t really need praise because at the end of the day, we know we\u2019re out here doing our job, and we\u2019re part of the team no matter what.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Gary Levin, USA TODAY", "title": "The craziest prison escape in decades is now a Showtime miniseries... from Ben Stiller", "description": "Paul Dano and Benicio del Toro star as murderous escapees from an upstate New York prison, and Patricia Arquette plays the flirtatious tailor-shop worker who helped them.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/14/escape-dannemora-tells-true-story-daring-prison-break-ben-stiller-paul-dano-benicio-del-toro/1977756002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/12/USAT/5be62cac-d552-4315-8de8-4e3e54003b99-DANNEMORA_102_0088.R.jpg?crop=3839,2163,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:54:24Z", "content": "Benicio del Toro and Patricia Arquette play convict Richard Matt and prison tailor-shop employee Joyce \"Tilly\" Mitchell in Showtime miniseries 'Escape at Dannemora.'

(Photo: Christopher Saunders/SHOWTIME)\n\nIt was the most daring prison escape in decades.\n\nTwo inmates serving life sentences for murder mounted a meticulous, detailed plan to bust out of the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York in 2015, tunneling through a catwalk beneath their cells to a manhole and at least temporary freedom.\n\nRichard Matt and David Sweat were aided by Joyce \u201cTilly\u201d Mitchell, a flirtatious (and married) employee in the prison\u2019s tailor shop where both worked and had sex with her, and Gene Palmer, a rogue guard who (perhaps unwittingly) slipped tools to the prisoners and looked the other way. On the lam for three weeks, and headed toward the nearby Canadian border, the pair eluded a massive manhunt until one was captured and the other killed.\n\nMore: Review: Ben Stiller directs a masterpiece in NY prison-break drama 'Escape at Dannemora'\n\nThe incredible story is the subject of a seven-part Showtime miniseries, \u201cEscape at Dannemora,\u201d that begins Sunday (10 EST/PST), directed by Ben Stiller and starring Benicio del Toro and Paul Dano as the prisoners and Patricia Arquette as Tilly, who\u2019s now serving a prison sentence for her role.\n\n\u201cIf this wasn\u2019t true I might have a hard time believing it,\u201d Dano says. \u201cIt was crazy.\u201d\n\nPaul Dano as Richard Sweat and Benicio del Toro as Richard Matt, the prisoners at the center of Showtime's 'Escape at Dannemora' (Photo: Wilson Webb/SHOWTIME)\n\nArquette gained 40 pounds to play \"femme fatale\" Tilly over most of the months-long production.\n\n\u201cIt was humbling, humiliating, interesting to go through life feeling like an invisible person,\" she says of Tilly, a libidinous philanderer. \"But when she\u2019s in (the prison), when she\u2019s at work, she\u2019s so visible.\u201d\n\nPatricia Arquette as Tilly and Eric Lange as Lyle Mitchell in Escape at Dannemora (Episode 3). (Photo: Christopher Saunders/SHOWTIME)\n\nStiller, a comedic actor and director, takes a sharp right turn as director of this dramatic story. \u201cIt was the first time I was really shooting anything where there wasn\u2019t that pressure on me to be funny,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made me realize how hard that is. It was at once freeing but also a new world.\u201d So was not appearing in scenes he directed: \u201cThat was the biggest change I enjoyed.\u201d\n\nBut residents of Dannemora, where some of the series was shot, had a different expectation: \"The attitude in the town was \u2026 Ben Stiller is going to make a comedy; that was the assumption. Maybe even Showtime had that assumption,\" he jokes. But \"when I got to the place and started to experience the reality of these people, I just wanted to show what happened.\"\n\nBen Stiller behind the scenes with Benicio del Toro on the set of Showtime miniseries 'Escape At Dannemora.' (Photo: Christopher Saunders/Showtime)\n\nStiller says he didn\u2019t closely follow the case in real time; he was in Europe filming \u201cZoolander 2.\u201d But \u201cwhat was interesting to me was how something like this happens in this day and age.\u201d\n\nDano\u2019s theory: \u201cIn prison you\u2019re trying to survive. Maybe part of the human condition is you need a goal, you need something to dream about. It took a lot of will ... to do what they did.\u201d\n\nA first script, written soon after the incident, largely invented its details, and Stiller demurred. But a subsequent New York inspector general\u2019s report, based on interviews with the accused and prison officials, filled in gaps and made the project a go. He also cast several people involved in the case to play themselves \u2013 including a tactical team, a sheriff\u2019s deputy, a nurse and a man who came upon the convicts hiding out in his cabin \u2013 and filmed in the actual locations where Sweat was recaptured and the pair hid out.\n\nBenicio Del Toro as Richard Matt in Escape at Dannemora (Episode 1). (Photo: Christopher Saunders/SHOWTIME)\n\nIn filming the series, Stiller says, \"you see how oppressive the prison experience is for all the people involved, and it does not feel like it\u2019s rehabilitating at all; it\u2019s more the opposite.\" His lesson learned? \"It made it clear that we need to fix the prison system. Places like Clinton represent how outdated it is, literally.\"\n\nThe actors and Stiller went to a different prison to meet with Sweat, who \u201csees himself as the mastermind brilliant person behind all the smart things that were done to escape, and also this innocent person,\u201d Arquette says. \u201cBut by a bunch of unfortunate incidents that were out of his control, there he is. It\u2019s that kind of sociopathic game.\u201d\n\nDel Toro says \u201cMatt\u2019s the one who had the original idea, so he\u2019s kind of like the producer of the movie, (Tilly\u2019s) the director and (David) was the actor.\u201d But \u201cthey were handicapped at the end.\u201d When things didn\u2019t work out as they\u2019d hoped, \u201cthey never had a Plan B.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/14/escape-dannemora-tells-true-story-daring-prison-break-ben-stiller-paul-dano-benicio-del-toro/1977756002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "The Associated Press, The Associated Press", "title": "Michigan man sentenced to at least four years in prison for shooting at black teen", "description": "A white retired firefighter who shot at a black teenager who was lost was sentenced Tuesday to at least four years in prison.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/14/mich-man-who-shot-black-teen-gets-least-four-years-prison/1997637002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/21ced4f5713b2114a038f01ff150f06e2dc5d3ef/c=0-589-2991-2279/local/-/media/2018/04/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636592458555313852-AP-BLACK-TEEN-SHOOTING-ARREST-99156679.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:41:35Z", "content": "This undated photo provided by the Oakland County Sheriff's Office in Michigan, shows Jeffery Zeigler.

(Photo: Dolby)\n\nDolby is a recognizable name at the neighborhood cinema, if not your own home theater.\n\nWhile Dolby Laboratories has licensed its technologies to electronics makers for years, and the landmark Dolby Theater in Hollywood is home to the Academy Awards, the company has never sold its own branded product directly to you or me.\n\nUntil now.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dolby releases its first consumer product, a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones called Dolby Dimension. And unlike most wearable portable speakers, aka headphones, it's designed primarily for use in the house, not on the go.\n\nYour initial thought might match mine: Aren\u2019t the folks at Dolby just a little bit crazy diving into such a congested market? I mean, how many companies make headphones nowadays?\n\nAppealing to affluent binge watchers\n\nAnd there\u2019s this: While Dolby has a reputation for premium audio quality, purchasing these headphones is going to set you back $599.\n\nAre they worth it? You\u2019ll have to decide whether you\u2019ve got the disposable income for this kind of splurge, but what I can say is they sound great and are comfortable to wear. For the money Dolby is asking, they better be.\n\nDolby is targeting affluent early adopters and those of you who spend a lot of time binge streaming \u2014 maybe so much so that you feel guilty you\u2019re isolated from your loved ones.\n\nDolby\u2019s solution is a feature inside Dimension called Dolby LifeMix, which lets you switch between nearly shutting out the outside world through active noise cancellation, or switching to an adjustable \u201ctransparency\u201d mode that lets you hear the telephone, doorbell, or, most importantly, your family, without sacrificing much in the way of audio quality. You can also choose a setting to boost the sounds from your surroundings.\n\nYou can tap the touch control on the right ear cup to toggle back and forth between noise cancellation and transparency mode, or adjust the setting inside the Dimension app on your phone.\n\nWith active noise cancellation turned on, I didn\u2019t hear the FedEx guy ring my doorbell the other day while I was watching Netflix at a loud volume. When I\u2019m home with my family, I chose a more balanced transparency setting so that I can more easily hear them if need be. The headphones have five omnidirectional microphones.\n\nThrough the touch control on the outside of the right ear cup, you can also change the volume or, if paired to an appropriate device, summon Siri or the Google Assistant.\n\nAnd through the app, you can turn on a \u201cvirtualization\u201d feature that is meant to allow you to further immerse yourself in a movie or TV scene, though I didn't get a complete surround-sound like feeling.\n\nThere\u2019s also a \u201chead tracking\u201d feature that is supposed to make the sound seem like it\u2019s coming from your screen, even when you turn your head. I sometimes had difficulty hearing this effect, though the truth is I was typically looking at the screen I was listening to anyway, which I suspect you\u2019d do as well.\n\nDolby has made it easy to switch among three paired Bluetooth devices by pressing one of the three corresponding buttons those devices are mapped to. So I was able to switch from watching on an Apple TV, iPad and my phone without having to re-pair those devices each and every time.\n\nYou can manage up to eight paired Bluetooth devices through the Dimension app, though only three correspond to the buttons on the headphones at any one time.\n\nCharging Dolby Dimension headphones. (Photo: Dolby)\n\nAn expensive feel\n\nDolby Dimension feels like the expensive product it is. The padded ear cups and headband are wrapped in synthetic leather; the curved headband made of stainless steel.\n\nDolby claims up to 10 hours of battery life with the LifeMix and virtualization features turned on or up to 15 hours in a low power mode when those features are turned off.\n\nThe headphones charge in a clever power base with one of the ear cups sitting snug inside a micro-suction foot that won\u2019t stain or leave a ring on your furniture.\n\nIf you mostly use the headphones at home, battery life shouldn\u2019t be a major issue. If you take them on the road, you can charge the headphones via USB, getting, Dolby says, about a two-hour charge after plugging them in for just 15 or 20 minutes.\n\nI like Dolby Dimension very much and found I wanted to use them more than I initially suspected I would. I was able to watch what I wanted to watch without disturbing my kids when they were doing their homework or my wife when she was catching up on work. But when they needed to get my attention they could, without having to yell or tap me.\n\nBut face it, we\u2019re talking about a luxury purchase here. At $599, Dolby\u2019s first consumer product is decidedly not for the masses.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2018/11/14/dolby-dimension-review-headphones-block-out-noise-high-cost/1986443002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Charisse Jones, USA TODAY", "title": "Macy's doubles down on tech, stores, and it pays off with higher sales", "description": "Macy's, which has been doubling down on tech and digital, reported a sales uptick in the last quarter and expects strong holiday season", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/14/macys-sales-rise-invests-both-online-and-stores/1997530002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b8b0abcb585d9841e5193c3d072eed1e5ce62bc/c=0-30-580-356/local/-/media/2018/11/11/USATODAY/usatsports/MotleyFool-TMOT-e6ad1113-lcuc_1_high_large.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:27:52Z", "content": "A Macy's department store.

(Photo: Macy's)\n\nMacy's, the chain that defined what it meant to be an elegant department store, has been doubling down on tech and digital, and those forward moves appear to be paying off.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, the retailer reported that sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.3 percent.\n\nThat news seemed to cheer investors. Macy's stock ticked up a little more than 1 percent to $36.20 a share in pre-market trading.\n\n\"Our strategic initiatives are gaining momentum and delivering results,'' Jeff Gennette, Macy's CEO said in a statement, who expressed confidence about the upcoming holiday season. \"We have the right merchandise, the right marketing and the right customer experiences in place to deliver a strong fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nShoppers are increasingly buying through the Macy\u2019s mobile app, with Gennette saying the retailer expects to see $1 billion in mobile sales this year.\n\nAnd the ability to buy online and pick up items at an actual store is giving a boost to Macy's e-commerce business which saw double digit growth in the most recent quarter.\n\nShoppers have the option of buying an item online that is in stock specifically at a local store, then picking it up within two hours. They can also buy merchandise from anywhere in the Macy's network and have it shipped to a nearby store.\n\nIt \u201cis a great example of how (the) ecommerce business and our stores business grow together,\u2019\u2019 Gennette said in an earnings call with investors.\n\nMacy's has also attempted to reinvent itself by tapping into technology and partnerships that can make it a destination at a time when shoppers have grown used to buying products ranging from muffins to mattresses without stepping into a store.\n\nThe department store chain is currently hosting Facebook small business pop ups in nine of its stores. Macy's has partnered with Story, a novel retail concept that treats its space like the changing pages of a magazine.\n\nAnd Macy's tech innovations include mirrors that allow shoppers to see what they would look like with varying shades of eye shadow and lipstick without actually trying them on, and a virtual-reality experience that enables customers to envision what tables, blinds and other pieces of furniture look like in their homes.\n\nMore Money: Coming soon to Bloomingdale's: LG TVs, washing machines and refrigerators\n\nMore Money: Macy's holiday windows for 2018: Meet Sunny the Snowpal\n\nMore Money: Status update: Facebook catches pop-up fever, opening first retail shop in 9 Macy's stores\n\nMacy's is also looking at possibly paring the space of some of its smaller, neighborhood locations which are often destinations for shoppers picking up online purchases, or running out to get necessities like skin care products.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at some of the excess space in some of these neighborhood stores,'' Gennette said, there are \"opportunities to redeploy that square footage.\u2019'\n\nOther retailers have rolled out smaller locations. Target has opened curated stores that cater to the needs and tastes of urban and college communities, while Nordstrom has a concept dubbed \"Nordstrom Local\" that instead of selling actual clothing, focuses on styling, tailoring and other services.\n\nCLOSE In a new partnership with Macy\u2019s, Facebook will be adding to the department store\u2019s pop-up area called \u201cThe Market.\u201d Buzz60's Natasha Abellard has the story. Buzz60\n\nMacy's reported net income of $62 million, or 20 cents in diluted earnings per share in the third quarter that ended Nov. 2. That was roughly double the $30 million and 10 cents per share reported during that same three month period last year.\n\nThose financial markers bode well going into a holiday season that is expected to be strong across the board for the retail industry.\n\n\"I think five years ago (Macy's) realized they were going to end up like Sears if they didn\u2019t change,'' said retail consultant Bob Phibbs, noting Sears' recent filing for bankruptcy protection. \"We're finding out the successful retailers are the ones who have stores and they\u2019re able to leverage those in a way that is pretty exciting... It's going to be a Miracle on 34th Street the sequel this year.''\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/14/macys-sales-rise-invests-both-online-and-stores/1997530002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Gene Sloan, USA TODAY", "title": "Peek inside the Ultimate Family Suite on Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas", "description": "Royal Caribbean's new Symphony of the Seas is home to what's billed as the most elaborate family suite ever conceived for a cruise ship.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/cruises/2018/11/14/symphony-seas-cruise-ship-ultimate-family-suite-photos/1993384002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/179ccd9192d5c81e4fa4f18204813250363463d3/c=0-309-6016-3708/local/-/media/2018/03/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636577292732654610-FamilySuite-075.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:23:14Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nSymphony of the Seas is the fourth vessel in Royal Caribbean's groundbreaking Oasis Class series, which began debuting in 2009.

Because they were making too much money\" from the payoffs, Lichtman argued.\n\nEven an unnamed representative of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was on the take, he said.\n\n\"Government officials at the very highest level can be bribed and conspire to commit crimes,\" Lichtman said.\n\nThe payoffs came from the massive narcotics trafficking organization of Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, Lichtman said, a Mexican drug lord he said has used bribes to avoid ever being arrested.\n\nLichtman also took aim at government witnesses who prosecutors say were former members of Guzm\u00e1n's crime organization.\n\n\"Imagine a group of witnesses who have lied every single day since they could walk,\" Lichtman said. \"People who will make your skin crawl when they testify here.\"\n\nThe opening statements were delayed for much of the day because two jurors asked to be let off the panel.\n\nOne told the court she would suffer from medical issues if required to serve. The other said he is self-employed and could not miss work for four months.\n\nBoth were dismissed and replaced with alternates who had been pre-screened for the trial.\n\nThe trial is one of the highest-security court proceedings in New York City since the terrorism prosecutions of suspects in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and a related plot to bomb city landmarks.\n\nFederal agents with bomb-detecting dogs checked the courthouse near Brooklyn's DUMBO and Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, while NYPD Emergency Services Unit offiicers and other security personnel checked the building.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n is charged with 17 criminal counts, including drug trafficking, conspiring to murder rivals, money laundering and weapons offenses.\n\nDuring the early and mid-2000s, he was allegedly a boss of the Sinaloa Cartel, the world's largest drug-trafficking operation. Prosecutors say the enterprise imported tons of cocaine from South America into the United States.\n\nHe and other alleged members of the cartel laundered billions of dollars in U.S. drug profits and sent the money to Mexico in vehicles with hidden compartments and other clandestine means, prosecutors say.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n allegedly maintained his leadership role in the cartel even when he was behind bars in his native country.\n\nCLOSE Mexican drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman is known for daring prison escapes.

(Photo: Larry Olmsted for USA TODAY)\n\nThe scene: Ski season is coming fast, and in the world of skiing, nothing is bigger than Whistler/Blackcomb \u2013 it\u2019s the largest, tallest and most visited resort in North America, hosted the skiing for the Vancouver Olympics, and is a bucket-list destination for skiers and snowboarders worldwide. In summer it has world-class golf and has long been known as one of the top mountain-biking destinations in the world. There is a lot to do here all year round, and Whistler is full of bars and restaurants of every description, but none of them is more famous than the town\u2019s icon, Sushi Village.\n\n\u201cSome people come back every year and eating (at Sushi Village) is a big part of it,\u201d said Marc Riddell, a longtime local and former ski patroller who now works in marketing for the mountain. Sushi Village was just the sixth restaurant in Whistler when it opened in 1985 \u2013 long before the current trendiness of sushi \u2013 and it has thrived ever since. While there are now well over a hundred eateries here, it remains Whistler\u2019s single must-visit destination.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like much, upstairs on the second floor of a retail building in the heart of the pedestrianized village, a block from the base of the slopes, above a snowboard shop. There is usually a line to get in, which can fill the balcony and spill onto the stairs. There\u2019s a hostess stand at the top of the stairs and once you get through the door, a small waiting area near the bar off to one side, which is packed as well.\n\nThe main dining room is an L-shaped restaurant wrapping around a bustling sushi bar, and the bulk of the seating is at tables and booths divided by Japanese-style wooden lattice half-walls. The walls are covered with a mix of skis, snowboards and art by a popular local artist with a colorful science-fiction feel.\n\nSushi Village is as much about drinking as eating, and it is loud, lively and boisterous. It is essentially a cross between a conventional restaurant and an izakaya, or Japanese pub. When founder Niki Homma passed away last year at age 70, Pique, a local magazine, wrote, \u201cIt's difficult to overstate just how groundbreaking Sushi Village was in its early years. Along with being the resort's lone Japanese restaurant in an era long before the West Coast developed its current sushi obsession, its success stemmed not from a desire to make money, but a lively, sometimes debaucherous atmosphere that remains virtually unparalleled to this day.\u201d\n\nReason to visit: Specialty sushi rolls, karage, takoyaki, sake.\n\nThe food: The menu is vast, with a huge assortment of specialty sushi rolls, a full range of more traditional nigiri sushi (individual pieces over vinegared rice) and lots of non-sushi dishes such as various teriyakis, donburis (rice bowls topped with varied ingredients), udon bowls, tempuras, hot pots, other assorted main courses and lots of appetizers and salads. There are 65 sushi options alone, and more than two dozen sakes to accompany these.\n\nThe main event is the house specialty rolls, large and ornate and often fun, such as the KFC roll, made with karage, Japanese-style fried chicken, which is sliced thin and wrapped with avocado. The hot volcano roll is another signature, seared tuna with mango, jalape\u00f1os and tobiko, orange-colored fish roe. The BC features barbecue salmon skin, highlighting the most famous seafood of the Pacific Northwest, with veggies and tobiko. The spider roll is deep-fried breaded softshell crab with avocado, daikon radish and cucumber, and is one of the best choices. Depending on your tastes and personal favorite proteins, all of these are well-executed, with some interesting combinations you are unlikely to find elsewhere, and you can actually taste the ingredients, unlike many contemporary sushi places where the rolls swallow up the flavors inside them.\n\nWhile it looks a lot like the ubiquitous local sushi spot now found anywhere, it is important to remember that Sushi Village was a forerunner of the trend and as a result, has a higher level of authenticity in its menu than most competitors in North America. As a result, my favorites were some of the bar food specialties, snacks that you would find in real Japanese izakayas and are less common here, like takoyaki, octopus meat cooked in puffy pastry in bite-size spheres, topped with brown sauce and dried fish flakes. I personally love Japanese-style fried chicken, karage, usually boneless pieces with a very crisp breading, another comfort food bar snack hard to find in North America. The version here is delicious, with perfectly seasoned coating and cooked to order, so it is served hot and juicy. It is also offered in a spicy option that is really good.\n\nFew major ski resorts are as close to the ocean as Whistler/Blackcomb, and fish are brought in from Vancouver. The traditional nigiri sushi and sliced sashimi were all first-rate, and I especially liked the hamachi (yellowtail). If you love fish, it is hard to go wrong.\n\nThe bar has an extensive craft beer and wine list, but Sushi Village is most famous for its sake and derivatives such as sake margaritas. There is a separate sake menu with more than two dozen styles, including my personal favorite, milky white unfiltered nigori sake, and the list is elaborately written with flavor details and style notes to help newcomers choose their perfect selection. But the restaurant is especially known for its shareable bottles of hot sake, in four sizes: traditional, large, jumbo and Dumbo, the unofficial apr\u00e8s ski king of Whistler. While this shareable giant, served in hand-painted, one-of-a-kind bottles, is a local institution, sake is best enjoyed cold and I\u2019d recommend choosing off the list. But no matter what you pick to eat or drink you are likely going to have good time at this spot that has been pleasing visitors for three decades.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy?: Yes \u2013 dinner at Sushi Village is a must-try rite of passage for any visitor to the famous ski and summer resort.\n\nRating: Yum! (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!)\n\nPrice: $$ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive)\n\nDetails: #11-4340 Sundial Crescent, Whistler Village; 604-932-3330; sushivillage.com\n\nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.

He might be an RB1 the rest of the season and will prove it on Sunday.\n\nWR Amari Cooper, Dallas Cowboys\n\nThe chemistry with and trust from Dak Prescott is there \u2014 18 targets, 11 catches since he was acquired by the Cowboys. Playing the Falcons (30th vs. the pass) will be productive for both of them.\n\nTE Evan Engram, New York Giants\n\nHe\u2019s shown some signs of trending up in the last couple of games, and now he gets to face the Bucs.\n\nDuds\n\nQB Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings\n\nHe hasn\u2019t exactly been a stud game to game all season \u2014 four games with one touchdown pass and four contests with 250 yards or fewer. Although the Bears are tougher against the run than the pass, I\u2019d look elsewhere in a matchup against Chicago on the road.\n\nRB Marlon Mack, Indianapolis Colts\n\nTwo back-to-back 100-plus-yard games turned into a 12-carry, 29-yard performance against the Jaguars. His next matchup? The 10th-best run defense in the NFL in the Titans. You may have to start him due to bye weeks, but don\u2019t expect much.\n\nWR Tyler Boyd, Cincinnati Bengals\n\nHe\u2019s the No. 1 receiver with A.J. Green out, but the Ravens allow the third-fewest passing yards in the NFL.\n\nTEs Jack Doyle, Eric Ebron, Indianapolis Colts\n\nAs we usually say, you\u2019re not benching either in this tight end climate. But here are the problems: Does Ebron repeat last week\u2019s three-touchdown performance? Maybe. Does Doyle become the star TE he was against the Raiders, keeping Ebron\u2019s value down? Maybe. Can they do anything against the Titans, the stingiest defense against tight ends? Maybe. Not quite a \u201cdud\u201d situation, but not a \u201csleeper\u201d one either.\n\nSleepers\n\nQB Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens\n\nThis comes with a giant asterisk. John Harbaugh could elect to start Robert Griffin III over Joe Flacco if the latter sits with an injury, or Flacco could play through his hip problem. But if the first-rounder is in for the game against the Bengals, it\u2019s an intriguing matchup.\n\nRB Rashaad Penny, Seattle Seahawks\n\nChris Carson might be back. Mike Davis looked good last week. But so did Penny, and I\u2019m wondering if he plays a lot more as a pass-catcher on Thursday if Aaron Rodgers pulls the Packers ahead. It\u2019s a risky move, but that\u2019s why the waiver wire pickup of the week is in the sleepers column.\n\nWR Josh Reynolds, Los Angeles Rams\n\nCooper Kupp is done for the season and we know the Rams can support three wideouts. And in a shootout against the Chiefs, it\u2019s possible all three WRs (Robert Woods, Brandin Cooks and Reynolds) put up big numbers.\n\nTE Vance McDonald, Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nThe Jaguars have allowed the 11th-most fantasy points to tight ends (per ESPN) in 2018. Coming off a week in which he scored, you could start him and see if he\u2019ll find paydirt again."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "9 Caribbean resorts that should be on your bucket list", "description": "Oyster.com compiled nine bucket list-worthy resorts in the Caribbean, from St. Lucia to St. Barts, and Jamaica to the Bahamas.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/caribbean/2018/11/14/caribbean-resorts-should-your-bucket-list/1997204002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/14/USAT/2c9c26b6-4665-4e03-8207-25ef7286b11f-COMO_Parrot_Cay_Turks_and_Caicos.jpg?crop=5911,3325,x1,y622&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:01:27Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nCasa de Campo Resort & Villas, Dominican Republic: Casa de Campo is a solid pick if you like your beach getaways to feel busy.

USA TODAY\n\nSecurity footage shows thieves rushing into a San Francisco Bay Area Apple store and grabbing devices on display while staff and customers looked on. (Photo: Santa Rosa, California, Police)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 All the thefts were brazen, quick and lucrative. And \u2013 so far \u2013 not deadly.\n\nTypically operating in groups of five or six, the hooded individuals burst into the Apple Stores, cut cables tethering iPhones and iPads, and within seconds were gone netting tens of thousands in hot tech merchandise.\n\nAlthough this recent rash of thefts across California may slow \u2013 state attorney general Xavier Becerra announced in September the arrest of 17 individuals connected to $1 million in Apple store robberies across 19 counties \u2013 they're indicative of a growing problem facing national retailers as the holiday shopping season nears.\n\nExperts in the field known as loss prevention say a combination of factors has given rise to a new level of threat to merchandise, employees and, alarmingly, customers, as organized gangs display more aggression during robberies than in years past.\n\nWhile to date none of these Apple robberies has resulted in significant injuries or deaths, with store workers and shoppers largely relegated to being stunned bystanders, the potential for an altercation gone bad looms large.\n\nIn 2017, there were 424 violent deaths in retail locations, according to The D&D Daily, a retail publication that monitors loss prevention. In the first quarter of 2018, there has been a 12 percent increase over the same time last year in violent deaths, half of them customers.\n\nWhile most of those are at convenience stores and pharmacies, \"big box retails from Walmart on down are making what they're calling 'store safeness' a priority,\" says Gus Downing, publisher of The D&D Daily. \"But no one has enough money to guarantee total security.\"\n\nThe prospect of a customer being hurt is \"a retailer\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d says Robert Moraca, vice president of loss prevention for the National Retail Federation. \u201cThere is a new level of aggressiveness, which a quarter of our members say has increased in the past year.\"\n\nRetailers report witnessing thieves yelling at customers to get on the ground, punching store employees and occasionally using mace. Two security guards at different Walmart stores were killed by thieves recently, says Moraca, who attributes this escalation to \"a lot of cultural factors.\u201d\n\nAmong them: the ease with which one can unload stolen goods through online platforms or by sending them overseas; jail overcrowding resulting in a loosening of criminal penalties for those stealing less than $1,000 in goods; police department financial strains cutting into officer ranks; and even the opioid crisis fueling desperation among cash-poor addicts.\n\nWhat\u2019s also at issue is the pressure brick-and-mortar retailers feel to create open-air floor plans to entice consumers \u2013 a style exemplified by Apple\u2019s sleek stores where goods are readily on display \u2013 who have the option of shopping safely online.\n\nMore: Retailers lost less to theft, fraud in 2017; retail cyber crime growing\n\nRelated: Calif. authorities charge 17 people in Apple store theft scheme\n\nConsidering that retailers are expected to earn $1.1 trillion in holiday sales this year, according to Deloitte, a 5 percent increase over last year. Given that potential haul, it is unlikely stores will consider measures that could deter impulse-shopping buyers.\n\n\u201cIf you put up too much friction by securing your items, your sales plummet,\u201d says Walter E. Palmer, practice leader at Epic Integrated Risk Solutions, the loss prevention advisory arm of Epic Insurance.\n\nPalmer says that while many grab-and-run thefts such as the ones at the California Apple Stores are perpetrated by gangs working for organized crime rings, the nation's drug addiction epidemic has driven up the number of individuals willing to steal to fund a fix.\n\n\u201cIt all adds up to a bad recipe for stores,\u201d he says, noting that his retail clients are eager to ways to keep the shopping experience safe without driving consumers away with heavy-handed security practices. \u201c(Retailers) are not cavalier about this issue by any means, but it\u2019s a difficult situation.\u201d\n\nAll retailers feeling the pain\n\nApple is by no means alone in grappling with theft, although its pricey wares consistently make those retail locations the nation's highest grossing, around $5,000 per square foot, almost double that of Tiffany\u2019s.\n\nAccording to a 2017 National Retail Federation survey of 63 retailers of varying sizes, 95 percent reported suffering from organized retail crime. Beyond electronics, hot items include designer clothing, razors and blades, designer handbags and various over the counter drugs.\n\nLululemon Athletica shares saw a great gain on Friday after the company announced that its most recent quarterly results Thursday afternoon. (Photo: Rob Crandall / Shutterstock.com)\n\nRetailers largely see such losses as part of the cost of doing business. For every $1 billion in sales, retailers lose $726,000. With U.S. retail sales at $5 trillion last year, that\u2019s around $36 billion lost to crime and other fraud.\n\nTop cities for retail crime typically have large ports where such goods arrive, and can also easily exit. They include top-seeded Los Angeles, followed by New York, Houston and Miami, the survey says.\n\nOpioid plague a factor\n\nRichard Hollinger, professor emeritus at the University of Florida who has been studying retail crime for three decades, says grab-and-run crimes have been around forever. But the growth of organized gangs and the surge in opioid use means that today\u2019s criminals have the potential to be far more violent.\n\n\u201cRetailers are loathe to send staff after criminals, and in fact the attitude mostly is if they\u2019ve hit the door, let them go, because they could be high or have a weapon,\u201d says Hollinger.\n\nA serious injury or, worse, death of a staffer or customer \u201cwould be a game changer, but at the same time, because retailers are concerned about optics they can\u2019t lock everything down. Shopping remains a tactile, visual experience.\u201d\n\nAn Apple store on Sept. 20 in China. (Photo: Apple)\n\nUSA TODAY contacted a range of retailers such as Walmart and CVS to seek comment about retail crime.\n\nMost either declined to comment, citing security reasons, or offered variations of Lululemon\u2019s statement: \u201cWe take crime very seriously and are following our protocol for responding to these incidents and cooperating with local authorities.\u201d\n\nThose authorities are busy. USA TODAY reached out to about two dozen police departments across California, where nearly a quarter of its 200 stores are located, and found that more than half the Apple stores in California made at least one call about a theft or robbery in the past year.\n\nBetween October 2017 and 2018, the Los Angeles Police Department received 532 calls for service about theft from the six Apple stores it covers, according to records.\n\nOf those 532 calls, 40 were classified as grand thefts, meaning 7.5 percent resulted in losses of $950 or more.\n\nApple is paying some local authorities to be stationed outside its store doors.\n\nIn one typical arrangement, officers sign up at the station house and are paid by the police department, and Apple then reimburses the department, says Margo Rohrbacher, public information officer with the Central Marin Police Department just north of San Francisco. She says the department is scheduling officers out through the end of the year.\n\nThe area\u2019s local Apple store in Corte Madera has been hit twice in recent months, mostly recently in August when five hoodie-wearing youths were caught on camera grabbing small electronics from display tables. In mere seconds they stole $24,000 worth of goods and disappeared into waiting cars.\n\n\u201cWe hear that people come up to the officers and say they\u2019re happy to see them there, it makes them feel more comfortable,\u201d says Rohrbacher.\n\nPaying for protection\n\nApple has taken that approach in other store locations plagued by theft. (A company spokesman declined to comment citing \u201cmatters of security.\u201d)\n\nAfter three thefts in four days at the Roseville, California, Apple location, officers began working security every day from open to close, says public information officer Rob Baquera. There have been no thefts since the officers started their overtime shifts in September, Baquera told USA TODAY.\n\nIn this Dec. 10, 2014 photo, a van sits inside the glass entrance of a Neiman-Marcus store on North Michigan Avenue, in Chicago. At least a dozen \"crash-and-grab\" burglaries, in which gangs drive stolen cars directly into retail businesses, has shop owners nervous and police stumped in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. (Photo: Brian Jackson, AP)\n\nFresno also has an ongoing contract with Apple, where an officer with a patrol car is stationed at the store from open to close after a July theft totaled $27,000 in losses, said public information officer Lt. Mark Hudson.\n\nAdding such security comes at a price. For example, Apple has collectively paid the Roseville and Fresno police departments, which both have ongoing contracts, about $148,000 from March to October, USA TODAY calculated based on supplemental law enforcement services rates listed online, records and interviews.\n\nApple is hardly alone in paying for customer peace of mind. In Berkeley, Apple used to payfor police to patrol its store as did Lululemon, the popular athletic wear brand, says public information officer Byron White.\n\n\u201cShoplifting is something that happens throughout the city,\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unique to Apple. It\u2019s just Apple gets a lot more publicity.\u201d\n\nRetail robbery do's and don'ts\n\nSo what can be done to stop or mitigate the impact of this rash of thefts that seem to be growing in frequency?\n\nLoss prevention experts say that retailers are experimenting with a range of options including video surveillance systems that flag security of behavior that\u2019s deemed suspicious, such as an individual not moving for an extended period of time perhaps because he or she is serving as lookout.\n\nCLOSE Here's the latest for Wednesday, August 2nd: Lawsuit claims White House, Fox News, conspired to fabricate news story; VP Pence in Montenegro; Police say customer shot, killed pharmacy robbery suspect; Last of 12 Alabama escapees caught. AP\n\nThere are also in-house training programs aimed at helping store employees learn \u201cverbal judo,\u201d says Moraca, in order to de-escalate aggressive situations.\n\nAnd when it comes specifically to electronics such as smartphones and tablets, one solution, if a time-consuming one, would be to take the time to connect each display gadget to a cloud service such as iCloud, which then would allow each device to be shut down after it is stolen.\n\n\u201cBut that would involve a whole level of systems administrations dedicated just to getting these display devices on and then off the cloud,\u201d says security expert Ralph Echemendia, also known as The Ethical Hacker. \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear a company like Apple would want to invest in that, since the loss of the items themselves is just a drop in the bucket for them.\u201d\n\nCLOSE A couple is using a baby to help them steal thousands of dollars in electronics from Walmart stores across Southeast Texas, according to police. VPC\n\nIndeed, whether it\u2019s yoga workout pants or razor blades or even TVs and smartphones, while theft does bite into the bottom line the losses so far seem to remain in the realm of what large retailers such as Apple, CVS and others are willing to live with.\n\nWhat would change that calculus, however, is any incident that sees an employee or customer injured or worse during a robbery. And for the moment, loss prevention specialists say that\u2019s a reality retailers prefer not to contemplate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the classic dilemma of retail,\u201d says Hollinger, a longtime advisor to members of the National Retail Federation. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your stores to be just display areas where goods are locked down. But if something happens to someone (during a robbery), it can become a really bad public relations issue for you, and quickly.\u201d\n\nFollow Nation writers @marcodellacava and @kristinslam on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/14/shopping-holiday-season-keep-your-eyes-door/1701218002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, A.J.

(Photo: Mark Konezny, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nPORT LEYDEN, N.Y. \u2013 Tony Stewart left NASCAR's cockpit two years ago, but he continues to thrive in the environment he long has called home.\n\nHe recently detailed his retirement goals: \u201cI just want to show up at the races, go to the shop, hang out with the guys.\u201d\n\nHe easily has exceeded those, just as he did during his 18-year stock car career that yielded three championships. His Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series team is positioned to win another driver\u2019s title at this Sunday\u2019s season finale with close friend Kevin Harvick behind the wheel. And the 47-year-old continues to race and win on his beloved dirt tracks.\n\nThe same kind of dirt track on which his car collided with and killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. in August 2014.\n\n\u201cIt really hurts to see him out there enjoying his life when, in my opinion, he should be in jail for manslaughter,\u201d Pamela Ward, Kevin\u2019s mother, told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cHe's out there racing and enjoying his life every single weekend. That\u2019s something my son would love to be doing, but he's six feet in the ground because of Tony Stewart.\u201d\n\nThe pain of losing their only son has been compounded by what the Wards believe is Stewart escaping any meaningful consequences for what he said was an accident, explaining that he accelerated through a turn in an effort to get away from Ward.\n\nWard, who had exited his car after crashing into a wall after a maneuver from Stewart, walked down the track, apparently gesturing at Stewart as the field drove by under caution. Stewart's car appeared to fishtail to the right, Ward was clipped by the rear right wheel, dragged and thrown from beneath the wheel several dozen feet down the track. He suffered massive blunt force trauma.\n\nDrug tests later revealed Ward had marijuana in his system.\n\nA grand jury chose not to indict Stewart for manslaughter or negligent homicide weeks after Ward's death. The wrongful death lawsuit filed against Stewart by Pamela and her husband, Kevin Ward Sr., tentatively was settled for an undisclosed sum \u2013 despite misgivings by Ward Jr.\u2019s family members \u2013 and became final in September. But those proceedings didn't bring the family closure.\n\nStewart, through a representative, declined to provide comment on this story when reached by USA TODAY Sports.\n\n\u201cHe seemed to me to be deeply sorrowful over the death,\u201d Mark Lanier, one of the nation\u2019s top litigators whose Houston-based firm represented the Wards, told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cI suspect it will plague him until the day he dies.\u201d\n\nReminders of their son are everywhere in the Wards\u2019 home, where he was raised and lived before his death. Kevin Ward Jr. usually is pictured with his No. 13 race car \u2013 often alongside trophies. The photos hang in the living room and many of the 600 trophies he accumulated since his first go-kart race a few days before he turned 5 sit in a garage.\n\nSome of Kevin Ward Jr.'s trophies from his career, which began with a go-kart race before he was 5. (Photo: Mark Konezny, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWard\u2019s first exposure to racing came at four months old when one of his sisters put Ward on her lap and took him for a spin on a short track their father had constructed in the backyard.\n\n\u201cMom wasn\u2019t too happy with that ride,\u201d Kevin Ward Sr. said with a smirk. \u201cHe was laughing the whole time.\u201d\n\nWhile NASCAR is the most popular form of racing in the U.S., Kevin Ward Jr. didn't dream of competing in stock cars. He had talked about racing in World of Outlaws, the nation's top sprint car series, but was content with racing on dirt tracks in the Northeast and Canada on the weekends, tinkering with his pickup and working at his father's industrial painting business.\n\n\"Racing in World of Outlaws was his ultimate goal,\" Kevin Ward Sr. said. \u201cHe liked sliding around in the dirt. He had no NASCAR ambitions.\u201d\n\nWith the help of his father and some sponsors, Kevin Ward Jr. bought two sprint cars for about $120,000 in the spring of 2014, just months before he died. Racing isn't cheap and while Ward was successful, his father said it's not a lucrative endeavor at that level.\n\n'We never wanted Stewart's money'\n\nWhile some have questioned the family's motives for a civil suit, Kevin Ward Sr. said the family wasn't interested in ruining Stewart financially.\n\n\u201cWe never wanted 10 cents of Tony Stewart\u2019s money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just wanted to know why Tony Stewart did what he did that night.\u201d\n\nThen-Ontario County District Attorney Michael Tantillo said the toxicology report on Ward \u201cindicated at the time of operation, he was under the influence of marijuana.\" Experts hired by Wards\u2019 lawyers disputed that Ward had anywhere near the level of marijuana in his system that would have caused him to be impaired, questioning the collection process along with how the levels of THC in his system postmortem were calculated.\n\nTantillo said results of Ward's toxicology report were not presented to the grand jury, leading the Wards to speculate they were released to the news media to tarnish their son's reputation.\n\n\u201cThat had nothing to do with my son and (Tantillo) had no reason to even put that out there,\u201d Kevin Ward Sr. said sternly. \u201cHe put that out there because he wanted to victimize Kevin. He knew that everybody would turn against Kevin for having that and for getting out of his car. He knew the public would take that hook, line and sinker and just ran with that.\u201d\n\nStewart\u2019s car was not immediately impounded by investigators and was loaded on the truck with the right rear wheel that struck Ward already detached. No alcohol or drug test was administered on Stewart.\n\nStewart, in a deposition in December 2016, denied that he steered toward Ward and added he didn't even know it was Ward who was approaching. He said he hit the throttle \u2013 which could be heard in the amateur video that circulated after the incident \u2013 \"to try to drive the car down to the left to get away from him.\"\n\n\"It was a split second from the time that I saw a person until I got to the person,\" Stewart said in the deposition. \"... I attempted to change direction.\"\n\nJessica Zemken-Friesen, a former girlfriend of Stewart\u2019s who was competing in the same race at Canandaigua Motorsports Park, said Stewart turned the other direction, putting his car on a path toward Ward.\n\n\u201cHe turned to the right and hit the throttle which cause the tires to stand up and throw dirt and smoke from them,\u201d Zemken-Friesen told an investigator from the Ontario County Sheriff's Office immediately after the incident. \u201cIf he did not hit the gas the rear of his car would not have gone to the right and hit Kevin.\u201d\n\nIn her deposition for the civil case, Zemken-Friesen said Stewart \u201ctried to scare\u201d Ward.\n\n\"I disagree with that,\" Stewart said in the deposition when asked about Zemken-Friesen's version of events.\n\nThe race car driven by Kevin Ward Jr. on the night he was struck and killed in 2014 sits in his father's garage. (Photo: Mark Konezny, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTantillo, who now works for the Yates County (N.Y.) District Attorney\u2019s office, told USA TODAY Sports that he approached the case as he\u2019s done each case in his nearly four decades as a prosecutor.\n\nTantillo called the Wards before the decision by the grand jury was announced and said he \u201csympathizes\u201d with the family. Kevin Ward Sr. remembers that call well.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018We're not going to charge Tony Stewart,\u2019 \u201d Kevin Ward Sr. relayed. \u201cI asked for the reason. He said the grand jurors said that they couldn't believe that your son got out of the car. I'm like, \u2018What did my son (getting) out of the car have to do with whether they're going to charge Tony Stewart or not?\u2019 I wanted to to reach through the phone and strangle that guy.\u201d\n\nFor a time, it appeared there could be another victim in all this: Ward Jr.'s on-again-off-again girlfriend told the family she was pregnant a month after their son died.\n\n\u201cI actually pulled her aside and asked her, \u2018For the sake of my peace of mind, is there any chance it could be anyone else\u2019s but Kevin\u2019s?\u2019 \u201d Pamela Ward said. \u201cShe looked me right in the eye and said, \u2018No. It\u2019s definitely Kevin\u2019s.' \u201d\n\nThe prospect a child would be left fatherless could have pushed damages into the $10 million-$20 million range, according to Lanier, the Ward family's attorney. . More importantly to Pamela Ward, she looked forward to what a baby would mean.\n\n\u201cI thought we would have a piece of Kevin,\u201d she said. \u201cI really thought I was going to have something from him, although at the same time I hated to think that the child would grow up without a father. We thought the baby looked like Kevin and he was born on Kevin\u2019s birthday. We thought that was a sign.\u201d\n\nThere was just one problem: A paternity test taken after the boy was born showed that the child wasn\u2019t Ward Jr.\u2019s.\n\n\u201cEverybody says that this was all about the money for us,\u201d Pamela Ward said. \u201cWhen we filed this case, we thought all the money was going to the baby. That\u2019d be Kevin\u2019s only heir. We weren\u2019t entitled to any when we filed the civil suit.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I think she really thought it was Kevin\u2019s. I don\u2019t think she purposely tried to mislead us.\u201d\n\n'It's not racing that killed my son'\n\nAs Stewart seeks his second Cup title as co-owner of Harvick\u2019s No. 4 Ford on Sunday, the Wards will be here, in this town of about 700 people, a couple miles from their son's grave site that features a colorful tombstone adorned with nods to Ward\u2019s racing career.\n\nSeven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson and this generation\u2019s most popular driver, Dale Earnhardt Jr., were among those who sent flowers to Ward\u2019s funeral.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of unfortunately many that I have sent flowers to,\u201d Johnson told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cEven though I didn\u2019t know him and didn\u2019t hang out with him, the racing community is a small one. It\u2019s something my wife and I like to do to show families we are thinking of them.\u201d\n\nPamela Ward and Kevin Ward Sr. visit the grave of son Kevin Ward Jr., located a few miles from their home in Port Leyden, N.Y. (Photo: Mark Konezny, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nPort Leyden is a landlocked village in northwestern New York, its name derived from its spot on a since-abandoned canal that ran nearby. The NASCAR finale will be contested about 1,500 miles south, just minutes from the Atlantic Ocean at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida.\n\nWhile Ward Jr. didn't have NASCAR aspirations, it's too soon to tell if the Wards' two grandsons \u2013 both age 6 \u2013 who race go-karts will have more of an affinity for stock cars.\n\n\u201cA lot of people ask me about (having her grandsons compete),\u201d Pamela Ward said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame anybody for what happened that night except for Tony Stewart. He loved racing. Unfortunately, he passed doing what he loved. It\u2019s not racing that killed my son. It was Tony.\u201d\n\nFollow Perez on Twitter @byajperez"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Firefighters use bulldozers to fight Sierra Fire in San Bernardino", "description": "Due to intense winds, San Bernardino County firefighters had to use bulldozers to fight the Sierra Fire.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/14/firefighters-use-bulldozers-fight-sierra-fire-san-bernardino/1997528002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/28911775001/28911775001_5966814362001_5966809812001-vs.jpg?pubId=28911775001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:53:13Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA Today", "title": "What the College Football Playoff committee got right and wrong in its third rankings", "description": "SportsPulse: What did the committee get right and wrong in the latest playoff ranking?

One thing is for sure, LSU's ranking is head scratching. USA TODAY\n\nLSU running back Nick Brosette scores a touchdown in the second quarter against Arkansas. (Photo: Nelson Chenault, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nEven the best television shows have an off night. In most cases, the College Football Playoff rankings make for good TV. The outrage! The drama! All your favorite names! Where will your team be ranked? Find out tonight at 7 ET, only on ESPN!\n\nThe latest rankings, issued on Tuesday night, represented a first in the history of the postseason format: Nothing happened. Well, things happened, but only to secondary characters \u2014 not the main cast. From No. 1 Alabama through No. 10 Ohio State, there were no changes among the top contenders. For this one night, nothing happened.\n\nWhich in itself was confusing. Take the case of LSU, which stuck at No. 7 despite struggling at times against Arkansas, the only team still winless in SEC play. The committee\u2019s appreciation for the SEC is obvious, seen not only with LSU but also in Florida\u2019s four-spot move to No. 13 after a 35-31 win against South Carolina.\n\nThat the Gators have such a lofty ranking might have an explanation: There just aren\u2019t very many good teams from the Power Five conferences. Right behind Florida is Penn State, for example, and the Nittany Lions simply don\u2019t look the part of a top-15 team.\n\nLSU\u2019s lack of movement is more of a puzzler. While the Tigers battled with two-win Arkansas, No. 8 Washington State won by 24 points at 5-5 Colorado. No. 9 West Virginia notched a 47-10 win against TCU. And No. 10 Ohio State won 26-6 at Michigan State, which was ranked No. 18 by the committee a week ago but fell out of the new rankings. Each win seemed to provide a justification for moving at least one of these one-loss teams ahead of two-loss LSU.\n\nThis very likely won\u2019t last. Each of those teams just behind LSU will have a chance this month to impress the committee: Washington State against Washington, West Virginia with Oklahoma and Ohio State against rival Michigan. Here\u2019s what else the committee got right and got wrong with Tuesday night\u2019s rankings:\n\nRight\n\n- Utah State finally cracked the top 25. This was at least one week overdue. The Aggies have won nine in a row since a season-opening loss to Michigan State, showcasing perhaps the most powerful offense among the Group of Five leagues. Just once in these nine games has Utah State scored fewer than 42 points; the Aggies accounted for 804 yards of offense in last week\u2019s 62-24 win against San Jose State. That this is one of the hottest teams in the country has been recognized by the Amway Coaches Poll, which has USU all the way at No. 13, but the committee is just now catching on.\n\nThat might not seem like a big deal, but how Group of Five teams are perceived during the first weeks is vital in terms of deciding the eventual access-bowl bid to the New Year\u2019s Six. No. 11 Central Florida has the inside track for that game by virtue of its unbeaten record, but the gap between the Knights and Aggies is wide enough where UCF could conceivably lose once during the regular season and still capture another major bowl with an AAC title.\n\n- The Big 12 is being recognized. The league has four teams in the top 16, led by No. 6 Oklahoma. The Sooners and West Virginia remain on a collision course: OU heads to Morgantown in the season finale on Nov. 23 and could meet WVU again a week later in the conference title game. Beyond the top pair, the committee has properly identified No. 15 Texas and No. 16 Iowa State as teams worthy of being just on the fringes of the current New Year\u2019s Six race. Only one will stay alive past this Saturday\u2019s in Ames.\n\nIn a broader sense, this week\u2019s rankings are a good sign for the Sooners and Mountaineers. That the committee seems to have a positive take on the Big 12 could be meaningful in two scenarios: one, where Ohio State beats Michigan and wins the Big Ten, and two, where Notre Dame loses a game and opens up another spot for a Power Five champion. In either case, a one-loss winner of the BIg 12 would be waiting to claim a spot in the top four.\n\nWrong\n\n- Fresno State shouldn\u2019t have fallen out. Previously No. 23, the Bulldogs fell from the poll after a 24-17 loss at Boise State, which debuted at No. 25. Think about the logic: Fresno State fell out after losing by a touchdown on the road in one of the toughest environments in college football \u2014 to a team now considered good enough for the top 25 \u2014 and now, at two losses, falls out of the rankings. At the same time, the Bulldogs\u2019 other loss, to Minnesota, looks much better after the Golden Gophers dismantled Purdue. Fresno State should still be ranked.\n\n- The SEC feedback loop. Kentucky at No. 17 is laughable. The Wildcats have lost two in a row, the latest by 17 points to Tennessee, and just last month scored a combined 29 points in beating Vanderbilt and Missouri. Mississippi State is at No. 21 despite having zero wins against teams currently in the Top 25. Why does this make sense? Kentucky is helped by beating Mississippi State, which the committee classifies as a good win. Mississippi State is helped by falling to the Wildcats, which the committee considers a good loss. Meanwhile, neither team looks remotely worthy of being viewed as one of the best teams in the country."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Erin Jensen, USA TODAY", "title": "Instagram-official alert!

That's what astronauts who travel to the International Space Station today already face, but the time it takes to complete just a one-way trip to Mars \u2013 nine to 11 months, give or take \u2013 will exponentially increase the psychological challenges and how we train people for them.\n\nSpace Camp's model of the International Space Station in Huntsville, Alabama.

They're going to have to figure out ways to test and see that beforehand,\" she said.\n\nAnd the training won't only involve the astronauts \u2013 but the family and friends they leave behind as well, said Lowell Zoller, former NASA project manager and emeritus docent at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center.\n\n\"If you're going to Mars or something goes wrong you cannot just say, 'let's turn around and go back'. It\u2019s not a matter of let's go home,\" he said. \"We're going to have to condition the families and people here on Earth as much as we condition the astronauts because this is the first time we were sending people far enough away that they can't see home.\"\n\nA replica of the lunar excursion module, designed for operations on the moon, sits in the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, on Oct. 25, 2018.

Because, if you take the really long view, we simply have to, says Stephen Petranek, author of \"How We\u2019ll Live on Mars,\" upon which National Geographic's series \"MARS\" is based.\n\nThe half-documentary, half-scripted drama TV show jumps back and forth between present-day Earth \u2013 where it shows how we currently are preparing to get to Mars and talk about issues that will develop once we get there \u2013 and a future where human beings live on and, eventually, industrialize the planet.\n\n\"Humans have been a nomadic species moving on from place to place on Earth for 95 percent of their existence,\" he said. \"There's a survival mechanism built into our DNA which says you should move on to the next horizon and the next wilderness.\"\n\nEventually, the sun will heat up and expand, consuming all life on Earth and probably throwing the planet out of orbit, Petranek said. Mars will face the same fate, but traveling to the Red Planet will be the jumping off point for human beings to voyage even farther.\n\n\"We can't live on Earth forever,\" he said. \"We have to become an interplanetary species.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/11/14/going-mars-trained-astronaut-heres-what-its-like/1832696002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Katharine Lackey, USA TODAY", "title": "How to become an astronaut: Tales from Mae Jemison and Leland Melvin about training for space", "description": "Former NASA astronauts Mae Jemison and Leland Melvin share what it was like to go through astronaut training and launch into space.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/11/14/mae-jemison-leland-melvin-astronaut-training-experience/1857296002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/05/USAT/993858dd-0f90-4813-a485-95e6c7e92863-XXX_One_Strange_Rock_Geographic_tab.jpg?crop=4095,2303,x0,y296&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:30:00Z", "content": "If you never got to go to space camp as a kid, now is your chance.

Jemison appears to be clicking her heels in zero-gravity aboard the Earth-orbiting Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1992. (Photo: NASA)\n\nMae Jemison brought an impressive resume along when she entered astronaut training: Doctor, engineer, Peace Corps medical officer in Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\n\"By the time I got to NASA, I\u2019d been around a block a bunch of times and been in some very difficult circumstances,\" said Jemison, the first black woman to travel into space.\n\nThe military trainers who took her through wilderness survival probably wish they had looked up that background.\n\n\"For some reason, they decided they wanted to pick on me, which I'm probably the worst person to pick on,\" she said. \"I used to hunt with my dad. I'm a doctor. You can't gross me out. I've worked in Africa. I've worked with all kinds of diseases.\"\n\nAfter killing a bird, they chose Jemison to clean it.\n\n\"I know that they thought I was going to be 'uhhh,'\" she said. \"I remember plucking (the bird) and they said, 'OK now you have to take the insides out,' and I said, 'They're already out' and I had them in my hand.\"\n\nMore: I trained to be an astronaut on a mission to Mars at Space Camp. Here's what it's like.\n\nJemison's classmates also displayed a wide range of expertise, with backgrounds as test pilots, neurologists and astrophysicists. \"What was really exciting about it was there were so many things you had to learn,\" she said about astronaut training. \"And then getting to learn a lot about the work that other folks did.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a big fire hydrant of information and that\u2019s really exciting,\" said Jemison, who today leads the 100 Year Starship Project, a nonprofit initiative with the goal of ensuring the capabilities exist for human beings to travel to another star by 2112.\n\nMae Jemison (Photo: NASA)\n\nThe training was so comprehensive that actually going into space didn't phase Jemison, who also helped actors get into the mindset of an astronaut on National Geographic Channel's series \"MARS.\"\n\n\"Of course it's different because what you can't train for is the consistent zero-g but you start to get used to it,\" she said. \"The human body is remarkable for its resiliency.\"\n\nLeland Melvin, another former NASA astronaut, had a similar experience. When he went into space for the first time, Melvin was in charge of robotics. His job centered around the installation of another module to the International Space Station.\n\n\"I'd never done that before. I'd only done it in the equivalent of a video game,\" he said. \"All of our training is basically screens and hand controllers, just like a video game.\"\n\nMission Specialist Leland Melvin poses for a photo on the shuttle Atlantis. Drink and food packets float around him in 2009. (Photo: NASA)\n\n\"When it came to the day that you've got to show that you've got the right stuff ... I realized that the training was exactly like what I felt in space. The dynamics of the arm moved the same way that they did on the ground in this virtual space,\" Melvin said.\n\nBy the time he came to NASA, Melvin also carried an impressive list of accomplishments. As a NFL player, he was well versed in the mental discipline and physical aptitude needed to pass the rigorous tests. \"Land survival, water survival \u2013 those weren't too difficult for me,\" he said.\n\nThe hardest \u2013 and what ended up being his favorite \u2013 part of training? Flying. \"You're just holding off going Mach 1 because you would blow out all the windows,\" he said. \"You're deploying these speed breaks to keep you below Mach so you can come in safely.\"\n\nThis close-up view of a water bubble floating freely on the space shuttle Atlantis shows a refracted image of astronaut Leland Melvin. (Photo: NASA)\n\nMelvin enjoyed the aerobatics of rolls, loops and turns involved in flying, even when the pilot was trying to pull a multiple G-force turn. They're \"trying to knock you unconscious,\" he said. \"You're trying to force the blood to stay inside your head so that you don't pass out.\"\n\nAs for how long training takes to complete? That's an open-ended question. Melvin first traveled into space in 2007, nine years after he entered the astronaut training program in 1998.\n\nEven when astronauts go into orbit more quickly, the training never stops, Jemison said.\n\n\"You're always training,\" she said. \"Even when you come back from a mission you're still training.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/11/14/mae-jemison-leland-melvin-astronaut-training-experience/1857296002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "WLTX-TV, Columbia, S.C., WLTX-TV, Columbia, S.C.", "title": "Winner of $1.5 billion Mega Millions jackpot has not claimed prize", "description": "State lottery officials said the winner of the huge $1.5 billion Mega Millions jackpot still has not come forward.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/14/winner-1-5-b-mega-millions-has-not-claimed-prize/1997462002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/10/24/USAT/f789828e-94cf-4b22-a58f-6468139d2295-AP_Lottery_Jackpot.jpg?crop=3883,2182,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:28:27Z", "content": "Media at left, record people entering the KC Mart in Simpsonville, S.C., on Wednesday, Oct. 24, 2018, after it was announced the winning Mega Millions lottery ticket was purchased at the store.

(Photo: Jon Elswick, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Shortly after 9/11, the CIA considered using a drug it thought might work like a truth serum and force terror suspects to give up information about potential attacks.\n\nAfter months of research, the agency decided that a drug called Versed, a sedative often prescribed to reduce anxiety, was \u201cpossibly worth a try.\u201d But in the end, the CIA decided not to ask government lawyers to approve its use.\n\nThe existence of the drug research program \u2013 dubbed \u201cProject Medication\u201d \u2013 is disclosed in a once-classified report that was provided to the American Civil Liberties Union under a judge\u2019s order and was released by the organization Tuesday.\n\nThe 90-page CIA report, which was provided in advance to The Associated Press, is a window into the internal struggle that medical personnel working in the agency\u2019s detention and harsh interrogation program faced in reconciling their professional ethics with the chance to save lives by preventing future attacks.\n\n\u201cThis document tells an essential part of the story of how it was that the CIA came to torture prisoners against the law and helps prevent it from happening again,\u201d said ACLU attorney Dror Ladin.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2007, CIA doctors, psychologists, physician assistants and nurses were directly involved in the interrogation program, the report said. They evaluated, monitored and cared for 97 detainees in 10 secret CIA facilities abroad and accompanied detainees on more than 100 flights.\n\nThe CIA ultimately decided against asking the Justice Department to approve drug-assisted interrogations, sparing CIA doctors \u201csome significant ethical concerns,\u201d the report said. It had taken months for the Justice Department to sign off on brutal interrogation tactics, including sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces and the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding. The CIA\u2019s counterterrorism team \u201cdid not want to raise another issue with the Department of Justice,\u201d the report said.\n\nBefore settling on Versed, the report said researchers studied records of old Soviet drug experiments as well as the CIA\u2019s discredited MK-Ultra program from the 1950s and 1960s that involved human experimentation with LSD and other mind-altering drugs on unwitting individuals as part of a long search for some form of truth serum. These experiments were widely criticized and, even today, some experts doubt an effective substance exists.\n\n\u201cBut decades later, the agency was considering experimenting on humans again to test pseudo-scientific theories of learned helplessness on its prisoners,\u201d Ladin said.\n\nVersed is a brand name for the sedative midazolam, used since the late 1970s and today sold commonly as a generic. It causes drowsiness and relieves anxiety and agitation. It also can temporarily impair memory, and often is used for minor surgery or medical procedures such as colonoscopies that require sedation but not full-blown anesthesia. It\u2019s in a class of anti-anxiety medications known as benzodiazepines that work by affecting a brain chemical that calms the activity of nerve cells.\n\nMore: CIA helicopter that landed in Afghanistan after 9/11 joins 'best museum you'll never see'\n\n\u201cVersed was considered possibly worth a trial if unequivocal legal sanction first were obtained,\u201d the report said. \u201cThere were at least two legal obstacles: a prohibition against medical experimentation on prisoners and a ban on interrogational use of \u2018mind-altering drugs\u2019 or those which \u2018profoundly altered the senses.\u2019\u201d\n\nThose questions became moot after the CIA decided against asking the Justice Department to give it a green light. \u201cAt the beginning of 2003, the Office of Medical Services\u2019 review, informally termed \u2018Project Medication\u2019 was shelved, never to be reactivated,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe CIA had no comment on the report\u2019s release, but government lawyers emphasized in a court filing in the case early last year that the report, expressly marked \u201cdraft,\u201d was just one agency officer\u2019s impressions of the detention and interrogation program. The document is not the CIA\u2019s or the Office of Medical Service\u2019s \u201cfinal official history, or assessment, of the program,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe ACLU spent more than two years in court trying to get the report released. In September 2017, a federal judge in New York ordered the CIA to release it. Government lawyers tried three more times to keep information contained in the report under wraps, but the ACLU received the bulk of the report in August. The government is still fighting to keep portions secret. They are to file briefs in a federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday, arguing that the judge ordered too much released.\n\nWhile the CIA\u2019s harsh interrogation program ended in 2007, the ACLU believes it\u2019s important to continue seeking the release of documents about it, especially since President Donald Trump declared during his campaign that he would approve interrogating terror suspects with waterboarding, which is now banned by U.S. law, and a \u201chell of a lot worse.\u201d\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel, who was involved in supervising a secret CIA detention site in Thailand where detainees were waterboarded, told the Senate during her confirmation hearing that she does \u201cnot support use of enhanced interrogation techniques for any purpose.\u201d\n\nMore: CIA releases 470,000 documents confiscated in bin Laden raid\n\nThe report cites many instances where medical personal expressed concern or protected the health of the detainees. Those who were thrown up against walls \u2013 a practice called \u201cwalling\u201d \u2013 had their necks protected from whiplash by rolled towels around their necks, the report said. When one detainee, who had been wounded during capture, was confined to a box, care was taken not to force his legs into a position that \u201cwould compromise wound healing.\u201d Physician assistants overruled using duct tape over the mouths of detainees during flights because air sickness could lead to vomiting and possible aspiration.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that the doctors were sadistic or anything like that,\u201d Ladin said. \u201cBut it means they were complicit because this pseudo-scientific torture could not have happened without the doctors\u2019 participation.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the medical office\u2019s report said waterboarding was not \u201cintrinsically painful.\u201d It said there was \u201cphysical discomfort from the occasional associated retching,\u201d but that two detainees who endured the most extensive waterboarding sessions complained only \u201cof the pain of the restraining straps.\u201d\n\nThat contrasts with the Senate\u2019s 2014 report on the CIA\u2019s interrogation program, which stated that a prisoner known as Abu Zubaydah, a suspected al-Qaida operative who was waterboarded more than 80 times, \u201ccried, begged, pleaded, vomited, and required medical resuscitation after being waterboarded.\u201d\n\nSome CIA medical personnel called waterboarding \u201clittle more than an amateurish experiment\u201d and others worried that the practice would trigger spasms of the vocal cords, which could, at least temporarily, make it hard to speak or breathe.\n\nAt the same time, other medical personnel contended waterboarding actually \u201cprovided periodic relief\u201d to a prisoner because it was a break from being forced to stand for long periods of time. The agency medical personnel also said the harsh interrogation program was \u201creassuringly free of enduring physical or psychological effects.\u201d\n\nDr. Sondra Crosby, who has treated victims of torture, including two who were held at CIA secret sites, disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe enduring pain and suffering experienced by the survivors of the CIA program is immense, and includes severe, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, physical ailments, and psychosocial dysfunction,\u201d said Crosby, of Boston University\u2019s School of Medicine and Public Health. \u201cAt least one detainee was tortured to death.\u201d\n\nJFK files: CIA lined up actress for date with Jordan's King Hussein during visit to United States\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/14/cia-truth-serum-after-9-11/1997442002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "NYPD police officer helps Irish family buy tickets to 'Hamilton'", "description": "The officer pulled a bill out of his pocket to cover the $20 difference so \"she didn't have to throw away her shot.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/14/nypd-police-officer-helps-irish-family-buy-tickets-hamilton/1997471002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/10/07/USAT/967b57b3-a5c7-4b04-a617-c0f05753b759-GTY_545754348.JPG?crop=4584,2562,x0,y182&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:21:31Z", "content": "Getting tickets for \"Hamilton\" still seems like an impossible task, and of course at this point, it's impossible to see it with creator Lin-Manuel Miranda or is it?

(Photo: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nA perennial All-Star was traded, LeBron James debuted in Los Angeles and the Eastern and Western Conferences have begun to reshuffle in what has been a dramatic first month of the 2018-19 NBA season.\n\nHeadlined by the blockbuster trade that sent Jimmy Butler to the Philadelphia 76ers, the first month of basketball has brought several key story lines to keep an eye on for the rest of the season, including the Toronto Raptors' run at an Eastern Conference title and the Denver Nuggets' emergence in the West.\n\nLet's take a look at some of the biggest winners and losers from the first month of NBA action.\n\nWinners\n\nThe rolling Raptors\n\nSitting atop the Eastern Conference at 12-2, Toronto should be happy with the early returns of the Kawhi Leonard-DeMar DeRozan trade that shook the NBA this offseason.\n\nLeonard seems to have returned to his form of a perennial MVP candidate. The 27-year-old is averaging 24 points per game on 46.9 percent shooting with a career-high 7.7 rebounds. He's been efficient from distance as well, shooting 38.1 percent on 3-pointers.\n\nThings have opened up in the backcourt for Kyle Lowry, who boasts a league-leading mark of 11 assists per game. Power forward Serge Ibaka has gotten off to a hot start as well, averaging 17.4 points and 8.4 rebounds through his first 14 games.\n\nWith rookie head coach Nick Nurse leading the way, there is a renewed sense of optimism in Toronto.\n\nMore: Warriors suspend Draymond Green for confrontation with teammate Kevin Durant\n\nMore: LeBron James speaks out about gun violence in America after Thousand Oaks mass shooting\n\nRed-hot Zach LaVine\n\nAfter playing in just 24 games last season, some were surprised to see LaVine receive a four-year, $80 million contract over the summer.\n\nLaVine has silenced those doubters with a blazing start to the season for Chicago. The 23-year-old is fifth in the league in scoring at 27.1 points per game and is second in shots per game. He has shown he can fill the role of a feature scorer while injured players such Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn and Bobby Portis work to return.\n\nDenver takes a step forward\n\nThe Nuggets came as close as possible to ending their four-year postseason drought last season, seeing their playoff hopes crashon the final day of the regular season.\n\nNikola Jokic and company have bounced back this season (despite a four-game skid), notching impressive wins over Golden State and Boston en route to a 9-5 record.\n\nJokic remains the glue, posting averages of 17.5 points, 10.4 rebounds and 6.9 assists.\n\nThe depth behind Jokic is equally formidable. Jamal Murray (17.8 points per game) and Gary Harris (16.9) combine for an exciting, young backcourt, while Paul Millsap (12.7 points, 6.9 rebounds) brings a solid interior presence.\n\nBudenholzer and the Bucks\n\nWith former Coach of the Year Mike Budenholzer running the show, Milwaukee ranks fifth in the league in pace. Last year, the Bucks were 20th under coaches Jason Kidd and Joe Prunty. With a 10-3 record, it is safe to say Budenholzer is on the right track with the Bucks' new-look offense.\n\nStar forward Giannis Antetokounmpo has thrust himself into the MVP conversation, averaging 25.4 points, 13 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1.4 steals. Khris Middleton has been a marksman from deep, nailing a career-high 46.4 percent of his 3-pointers.\n\nBig-name rookies\n\nLed by Deandre Ayton, Luka Doncic and Trae Young, the 2018 draft class has already made its presence felt.\n\nDoncic leads all rookies with 19.6 points per game, but his talents don't stop there. The 19-year-old is averaging 6.5 rebounds and 4.4 assists per contest to go along with efficient shooting numbers as well.\n\nYoung faced some heat after an up-and-down second half to his only season at Oklahoma and a disappointing showing in the NBA Summer League, but his first month in the NBA has shown why Atlanta liked him so much. The point guard is second among rookies in scoring at 17.5 points per game and ranks first in assists with 8.2.\n\nAyton has lived up to expectations so far in Phoenix, averaging 15.9 points and 10.6 rebounds. The 20-year-old big man has a chance to become the first rookie to average a double-double since Karl-Anthony Towns in 2015-16.\n\nLosers\n\nThe post-LeBron Cavs\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Cleveland has regressed after losing James to the Lakers this offseason. The Cavs own the NBA's worst record at 2-11 (tied with Phoenix) and are headed toward one of the top picks in the lottery.\n\nThe first domino to fall was head coach Ty Lue, who was fired after an 0-6 start. Assistant coach Larry Drew took over, but it remains to be seen if he is the long-term answer for the franchise.\n\nInjuries to Kevin Love, George Hill and Sam Dekker have shifted a heavy burden onto young players Collin Sexton and Cedi Osman, who might not be ready yet for this added workload.\n\nThe Timberwolves' front office\n\nNo team has had a more dramatic one-month stretch than the Timberwolves.\n\nAfter going 0-5 on a West coast road trip and seeing their record fall to 4-9, Minnesota followed through on what had been rumored since September, trading Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.\n\nIt was a little over a year ago that Minnesota traded LaVine, Dunn and a draft pick that turned into Markkanen for Butler, who was supposed to catapult the franchise into contention. Yet, after just one playoff game won, the Timberwovles are moving on.\n\nWashington's window\n\nThis could end up being a make-or-break year for the Wizards, who have put together a stretch of four playoff appearances in five years behind the core of John Wall and Bradley Beal.\n\nIf the first month of play is any indication, the Wizards could wind up as sellers, as they find themselves towards the bottom of the East at 4-9.\n\nDefense\n\nScoring is at a peak in the NBA, and it does not seem to be slowing down.\n\nNBA teams are averaging an astounding 110.6 points per game this season, which is the highest since the 1984-85 season. The points-per-game mark has increased every year since 2014-15, showing the influence that the Warriors' up-tempo style has had on the rest of the league.\n\nThe uptick in points per game is not necessarily a result of better shooting \u2014 field goal and 3-point percentages have held steady to previous years \u2014 but more possessions. For the first time since the 1988-89 season, NBA teams are averaging over 100 possessions per 48 minutes, according to Basketball-Reference."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Special to USA TODAY, Steve Strauss, Special to USA TODAY", "title": "3 ways to rock your small business holiday marketing, starting right now", "description": "Running behind on holiday marketing?

The Philadelphia area was ranked sixth for activities and weather (Photo: Russ Brown Photography)\n\nDid you hear the one about the small business owner who was too busy to market the business for Black Friday and Cyber Monday?\n\nThat entrepreneur lost a ton of money.\n\nIn the seminal small business book \"The E-Myth,\" author Michael Gerber writes too many small business owners spend far too much time working IN their business, and far too little time working ON their business. Working on the business can mean a lot of things, but here it means taking the time to think ahead and plan for the upcoming selling season, be it the holidays, or summer, or whatever.\n\nIf you are running behind, fear not. Here are 3 powerful ways to rock your digital marketing this holiday season, even if you are just getting started:\n\n1. Launch a Google Ads campaign.\n\nPreviously known as Google AdWords, Google Ads allow searchers to find your products while they are looking for similar items or information on Google. While it is very difficult to get on the first page of a Google search result organically (no matter what the \u201cexperts\u201d say), you can buy your way to a Page 1 result with a Google ad.\n\nAnd think about this: What are people looking for when they search on Google? Answer: Information RIGHT NOW about a subject. If they see your ad when they are highly motivated and searching, that can quickly turn into a warm lead.\n\nMore: Baret Bats: Air Force veteran's hand-crafted small business hits a home run\n\nMore: Macy's holiday windows for 2018: Meet Sunny the Snowpal\n\nMore: How do cyber-criminals hack small business startups? Here's what we learned from Microsoft\n\nThe secret is to target the right keywords, words people will likely use in their search that relates to your products. Use a keyword research tool to find highly searched words related to your product. Say that you sell snowboards in Maine. Target keywords such as \u201cSnowboards, Maine,\" \"best skiing gifts\u201d or \u201cgiving a snowboard.\u201d Then create specific landing pages for those products and advertise on Google targeting these desired keywords.\n\nVoila! You are instantly back in the holiday sales game.\n\nKeys to success:\n\n\u2022 Have a call to action: \u201cSale ends in 3 days!\u201d \u201c25% off this week only!\u201d\n\n\u2022 Use the magic words: \u201cFree\u201d and \u201cSale\u201d are the two most powerful words in advertising\n\n\u2022 Use seasonal words: \u201cHappy Holidays!\u201d \u201cHoliday sale!\u201d\n\n\u2022 Test and refine: Google Ads are great because you can check results 24/7 and make necessary changes immediately.\n\n2. Use retargeting.\n\nYou know this drill. You read an article about Hawaiian vacations, or click on a link about them, and then all of a sudden, ads for Hawaiian vacations are all you see online for two weeks. That\u2019s called retargeting.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Say someone comes to your site to check out your snowboards. With retargeting, a cookie ends up on their computer (it\u2019s legal, don\u2019t worry), and ads for your snowboards then show up while they are reading a news site, or watching a video, or whatever.\n\nRetargeting is great because it helps keep your site and brand and products top of mind.\n\n3. Use seasonal video in your email marketing.\n\nWhat is the most important part of selling online \u2013 price, availability, 2-day-shipping? Nope, nope, and nope. As it turns out, selling online often requires some sort of emotional connection. If people feel good about your business or product, they are far more likely to buy it.\n\nThat\u2019s where your e-newsletter generally, and video specifically, comes into play. Your e-newsletter is great because it is a personal connection with your tribe, and even better, they have opted-in; they want you to email them.\n\nVideo doubles down on that. People love to watch video online, and in an e-newsletter it is clicked more than anything. So create some friendly, fun, and/or personal holidays videos and share them in your seasonal e-newsletter. Have the staff sing a Christmas carol, or have your VP of sales make a cheesy video. Give a personal, warm season\u2019s greeting.\n\nThe good news is that you need not worry if you haven\u2019t started your holiday marketing. Use these tricks and there is still plenty of time.\n\n\u2014\n\nSteve Strauss, @Steve Strauss on Twitter, is a lawyer specializing in small business and entrepreneurship who has been writing for USATODAY.com for 20 years.

One dozed in a darkened room, the other was wrapped in a blanket in the locked cafeteria.\n\nThe sleeping staffers became a focal point of a new, scathing internal report about patient care at the facility, sparked by a nurse\u2019s complaint that veterans were getting substandard care, according to a letter sent late last month to President Donald Trump and Congress by the agency that protects government whistleblowers.\n\n\u201cWe have significant concern about the blatant disregard for veteran safety by the registered nurses and certified nurse assistants,\u201d agency investigators wrote in a report about the 112-bed facility.

Five months later, none has been released.\n\nVA spokesman Curt Cashour told USA TODAY that the agency is working with an outside contractor to remove patient information from reports. He said the VA expects to release \"publicly redacted versions of the most recent reports\" around Christmas.\n\nThat's not good enough for Leslie Roe, whose husband of 38 years walked out of a supposedly secure unit at the VA nursing home in Tuskegee, Alabama, last year and was never found.\n\nRoe, who had Navy veteran Earl \"Jim\" Zook declared dead this year, wants the VA to immediately release three years' worth of inspection reports \u2013 the standard for private-sector nursing homes whose reports are posted on a federal website, NursingHomeCompare.\n\n\"It's just a shame the way the VA is,\" she said. \"It can't help Jim, but maybe it can help just one other person.\"\n\nThe reports can include incidents of poor care and conditions that can be a tip-off to prospective or current residents and their families about problems with staffing or neglect at a facility.\n\n\"What are they hiding?

They show 45 of its nursing homes received the lowest one out of five stars for quality as of June 30. That\u2019s down from 58 in March. The VA has 133 nursing homes that serve 46,000 infirm veterans each year across the country.\n\nMore: Secret VA nursing home ratings for 2017\n\nAt the nursing home in Brockton, residents were, on average, more likely than residents of other VA nursing homes to deteriorate, feel serious pain or suffer from bedsores, according to agency data. They were nearly three times as likely to have bedsores than residents of private nursing homes.\n\nLicensed practical nurse Patricia Labossiere said she complained to the Office of Special Counsel, a federal whistleblower agency, this year after supervisors in Brockton ignored her alerts.\n\n\u201cI am a no-nonsense nurse who took a vow to take care of patients,\u201d said Labossiere, who quit in July. \u201cWe are there to be kind and treat others as we would want to be treated. I could not believe that this was how we treat the people that fought for our country.\u201d\n\nLabossiere said she saw instance after instance of poor patient care at the facility within days after she started working there last December. She told the federal whistleblower agency that nurses and aides did not empty the bedside urinals of frail veterans. Nurses failed to provide clean water at night and didn\u2019t check on the veterans regularly, as required, she said. They often slept when they were supposed to be working.\n\nShe offered some specific examples: One patient had trouble breathing because his oxygen tank was empty. Another fell \u2013 his feeding tube got disconnected, and the liquid splashed onto the floor \u2013 and didn\u2019t appear to have been monitored by staffers for hours.\n\nThe VA investigators did not substantiate those allegations, saying the patient with the empty oxygen tank suffered no ill effects. Investigators couldn\u2019t confirm that the patient who fell had been neglected because the records were shredded \u201cin accordance with the local policy.\u201d\n\n'Routinely receiving substandard care'\n\nThe VA nursing home in Brockton, Mass., is among the lowest-rated. (Photo: John Tlumacki, The Boston Globe)\n\nWahl, the VA spokeswoman, noted that the investigators \u201cdid not find evidence of veteran harm or neglect.\u201d She said the facility\u2019s one-star rating is undeserved and not an \u201caccurate reflection of the quality of care delivered to our patients.\"\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel ordered the VA\u2019s Office of Medical Inspector to investigate Brockton after Labossiere\u2019s complaint. The office turned over its report in September to special counsel Henry Kerner, who sent the findings to Trump and Congress on Oct. 23.\n\n\u201cBecause a brave whistleblower came forward, VA investigators were able to substantiate that patients at the Brockton (nursing home) were routinely receiving substandard care,\u201d Kerner said in an emailed statement.\n\nThis is not the first time the Brockton facility has come under fire by the Office of Medical Inspector.\n\nIn 2014, a doctor at the nursing home alleged that three veterans with significant mental health issues received \u201cinappropriate medical and mental health care.\u201d\n\nTwo of them went years, he alleged, without appropriate treatment. A third allegedly received psychotropic drugs for more than two years against written instructions.\n\nInvestigators largely substantiated the allegations, finding that two veterans with significant psychiatric issues did not receive adequate treatment for years. They did not substantiate the allegation that a third received improper medication.\n\nMore: Secret VA nursing home ratings hide poor quality care from the public\n\nMore: Secret data: Most VA nursing homes have more residents with bedsores, pain, than private facilities\n\nMore: Bedsores, neglect, alleged abuse: Inside low-rated VA nursing homes\n\nMore: Lawmakers demand secret VA nursing home data be released after USA TODAY, Boston Globe report\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/14/va-nursing-homes-ratings-patient-care-veterans-affairs/1947406002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Opinion contributor, Imam Omar Suleiman, Opinion contributor", "title": "After historic midterm election wins, Muslims struggle a little less to feel fully American", "description": "Muslims watched the midterm elections with a new sense of belonging.

It\u2019s also the book that the first two Muslim women to ever be elected to the United States Congress will likely use to take the oath of office.\n\nMuhammad is the name of the prophet of Islam.

It\u2019s also where Congresswoman-elect Rashida Tlaib\u2019s parents came from before she was born in Detroit.\n\nThere is something special about seeing yourself in your leaders, especially when your community is targeted by the highest leader of the land. To be clear, Islamophobia is not unique to the Donald Trump era. Since 9/11, the Muslim community in this country has struggled to articulate how it sees itself authentic both to it\u2019s Muslim and American identities.\n\nThe burden of being Muslim in America\n\nA little over a decade ago, Keith Ellison and Andre Carson became the first two Muslim congressmen in the history of the United States. Shortly after, Barack Hussein Obama ran for president with many trying to delegitimize him by suggesting that he was a secret Muslim. The insinuation was that he would not be loyal to the country if he were indeed a Muslim. While those attempts ultimately failed at halting his road to the presidency, they succeeded in further alienating a Muslim community that was already feeling the brunt of the collective guilt assigned to it after 9/11.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report by The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), 60 percent of American Muslims report experiencing religious discrimination \u2014 more than any other faith group in America. In 2017, 42 percent of Muslim families with kids in grade school said their child was bullied. Tragically, 1-in-4 of the incidents involved a teacher or administrator as the bully. But hate doesn\u2019t stop at just name calling. According to the FBI, hate crimes targeting Muslims went up by 67 percent in 2015 and again by another 19 percent in 2016.\n\nMore: As a mother \u2014 and a Muslim \u2014 in America, I see our flaws and failures, but also our potential\n\nAfter Tree of Life attack, don't tell Jews all hate crimes & bigoted attacks are the same\n\nRomney: Trump is wrong to vilify the press. It's not the enemy, it's critical to democracy.\n\nBeyond the hate crimes that compromise the safety of Muslim Americans are the paralyzing psychological messages young Muslims constantly receive. Most young Muslims were either not yet born when 9/11 took place, or are too young to remember it in any meaningful way. Yet they have been tasked with not only proving their own innocence, but their religion\u2019s innocence of terror as a whole.\n\nThat burden weighs heavily as politicians are willing to exploit irrational fears about the Muslim community to win elections and stay in power.\n\nMuslims making history, not just witnessing it\n\nThrough my organization, the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, a non-profit research organization dedicated to Muslim identity formation, I talk with young Muslims about the harmful effects of Islamophobia and how it leaves them unsure about both their national and religious identities. Most Muslim youth we talk to feel overwhelmed from the exhaustion of having to be hyper-focused on embracing their American identity to prove that they aren\u2019t foreign foes. At the same time, many are convinced that the only way to excel is to relinquish their Muslim identity, or at least obscure it from the public.\n\nSo it means something to see Ibtihaj Muhammad triumphing to become the first American Muslim woman in hijab to win an Olympic medal. Or Tahera Rahman becoming the first on-air TV reporter to wear hijab in the United States after years of privately struggling against those who told her she would never get ahead with a veil on her head. Or even a Dagestani fighter named Khabib Nurmagomedov hoisting the Ultimate Fighting Championship lightweight title in Las Vegas after being taunted because of his religion. And all of us still live a little through the legend of Muhammad Ali.\n\nBut this is different. Before she was elected, Rashida Tlaib was dragged out of a Trump rally for challenging the president. If Ilhan Omar was still a Somali refugee seeking asylum, she would have had the door shut in her face by Trump\u2019s travel ban against predominantly-Muslim countries. Now she can directly challenge the Trump administration\u2019s refugee policies from within the halls of Congress.\n\nFor many years, Muslims have watched elections be about us, without us. Candidates spoke either in favor of or against us, but we were never the candidates ourselves. That is changing, and young Muslim Americans are watching with not only a renewed sense of belonging, but with a distinctive spirit of courage.\n\nImam Omar Suleiman is the founder and president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research and an adjunct professor of Islamic studies at Southern Methodist University.

USA TODAY\n\nNationals right fielder Bryce Harper is seeking a deal worth more than $300 million. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBryce Harper, a National League MVP at 23, is a free agent at 26, peddling his services in an industry that\u2019s grown to nearly $11 billion in annual revenues. His combination of skills, age and marketing cachet make him an excellent fit for any major league baseball franchise.\n\nParticularly the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nHarper, a career .279 hitter with 184 home runs, rejected a 10-year, $300 million contract in September from the Washington Nationals.\n\nA look at why Harper -- the top free agent on the open market -- could and should sign with the Cardinals:\n\nWherever Harper lands, the big-picture implications will far outweigh a team\u2019s 2019 alignment. As it turns out, Harper fits in St. Louis now and later.\n\nHis signing would displace the struggling Dexter Fowler in right field, though it won\u2019t make the $50 million owed Fowler disappear. That\u2019s OK \u2013 Fowler could assume a reserve role, reboot his career and take a crack at a starting job in 2020, when Marcell Ozuna likely departs in free agency.\n\nIn the meantime, a Harper-Harrison Bader-Ozuna outfield gives the Cardinals a nice balance of power and defense. Ozuna hit 37 homers for the 2017 Miami Marlins, but managed just 23 and a .758 OPS in 2018, due in large part to a right shoulder that required a \u201ccleanup\u201d surgery last month.\n\nAssuming Ozuna is healthy, a Matt Carpenter-Ozuna-Harper pairing near the top of the lineup would be punishing. Harper\u2019s presence and Carpenter\u2019s versatility means the club could deploy young sluggers Jose Martinez and Tyler O\u2019Neill in creative platoons \u2013 or deal one of them for depth elsewhere.\n\nAbove all, they\u2019d be buying Harper\u2019s lifetime .388 on-base percentage and .900 OPS, sticking it in the middle of the lineup for the next decade-plus and working out the details later.\n\nOff the field\n\nAs much as The Cardinal Way and the mythology surrounding it evokes an image of the selfless, noble organization where the whole (milk?) is greater than the sum of its parts, let\u2019s be honest: The Cardinals love their superstars. From Hornsby to Musial to Gibson to Brock, to Ozzie, Pujols and Yadi, a club has stamped its imprint on a vast region of the country thanks to a gaggle of generational talents.\n\nAnd there\u2019s about to be a significant void.\n\nYadier Molina, a shoo-in to don the red coat of Cardinal hall of famer and a decent bet for Cooperstown, turns 37 next July, and his contract expires after 2020. While Molina\u2019s still performing at an All-Star level, it\u2019s not realistic to expect such returns when he\u2019s on the doorstep of 40.\n\nBader is a nice player, but with defense his primary calling card, not the sort around which to build a movement. Their top emerging players are all pitchers \u2013 Jack Flaherty, Dakota Hudson, Alex Reyes \u2013 with no slam-dunk positional superstars near the top of the minors.\n\nStepping into this void would also have some appeal for Harper.\n\nIt\u2019s long been presumed he\u2019d yearn for the bright lights of one of the coasts or a major market like Chicago. Heck, he idolizes old Yankees, hails from Las Vegas and has a dog named Wrigley.\n\nYet none of those places provide the clean landing he could stick in St. Louis.\n\nImagine signing with the Yankees, and possibly displacing Giancarlo Stanton, or trying to gamely share the spotlight with Aaron Judge.\n\nImagine signing with the Cubs, and possibly being perceived as the guy who forced franchise icon (and Vegas pal) Kris Bryant out of town when he\u2019s eligible for free agency.\n\nImagine signing with the Dodgers and taking on all the expectations as the star for whom they broke the bank while they treat the rest of the roster like Tampa Bay West.\n\nIn St. Louis, he\u2019d have no such concerns, and for a good while be hailed as The Superstar Who Chose Us. That would allay plenty of initial pressure players face when switching teams.\n\nWhy they could pull it off\n\nWith a franchise value estimated at $1.9 billion and annual revenues approaching $350 million, according to Forbes, the Cardinals certainly have the cash. They also have a decent bit of financial flexibility.\n\nThe contracts of Carpenter ($14.75 million), Molina ($20 million) and Fowler and Carlos Martinez ($16.5 million and $11.7 million, respectively) fall off the books each of the next three seasons, leaving only shortstop Paul DeJong\u2019s team-friendly pact as a long-term commitment. If their young pitching continues panning out, that would buy further flexibility in the early years of the deal.\n\nWorth noting: Had Albert Pujols accepted the Cardinals\u2019 reported 10-year, $210 million offer (in 2011 dollars, no less), there\u2019d still be three years remaining on that deal. In that light, Harper\u2019s contract could be viewed as found money, and for a player six years Pujols\u2019 junior at the time of signing.\n\nWill it happen?\n\nPossibly \u2013 although long-term perceptions would have to yield to new realities.\n\nFor the Cardinals, it\u2019s the notion that it\u2019s imprudent for them to tie up so much payroll - let\u2019s say 12 years, $420 million \u2013 in one player. That they lack the financial muscle of the game\u2019s big-market beasts. That they excel at finishing second but rarely winning the player \u2013 be it their own talents like Pujols or Jason Heyward or convincing a megawatt star like Stanton to come to town.\n\nFor Harper, there are far more unknowns. Despite his occasional dropping of context clues \u2013 look, it\u2019s Harper, Bryant and their wives, out on the town! \u2013 Harper has truly played this process close to the vest. What we do know is that before he was old enough to drive, he\u2019s been riding shotgun with super agent Scott Boras. Bet on Harper getting exactly what he wants \u2013 be it a record-setting contract, a consistent chance to win, a return to Washington, a destination close to home.\n\nThe Cardinals can certainly fulfill many of those desires.\n\nFollow Lacques on Twitter @GabeLacques"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Woman chokes McDonald's employee allegedly over ketchup", "description": "A woman was arrested after attacking a McDonald's employee allegedly over not getting ketchup with her order, Santa Ana, California Police say.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/14/woman-chokes-mcdonalds-employee-allegedly-over-ketchup/1997412002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/14/USAT/2e455377-ecd0-45c0-a3e9-6050591a72af-VPC_KETCHUP_FIGHT_LEADS_TO_ARREST_THUMB.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T11:49:47Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "AP Top Stories November 14 A", "description": "Here's the latest for Wednesday November 14th: Search for more Northern California fire victims; 'El Chapo' trial begins; Florida vote counting case going to court; Michelle Obama tells Oprah about book.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/14/ap-top-stories-november-14-/38524231/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5966792182001_5966779322001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T11:42:52Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "WUSA-TV, Washington, By Chelsea Cirruzzo and Lorenzo Hall, WUSA-TV, Washington", "title": "Man arrested on gun charges said synagogue shooting victims 'deserved it,' say court docs", "description": "A D.C. man who was arrested on Friday on gun charges allegedly had social media ties to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter, court documents said.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/14/man-arrested-d-c-had-alleged-online-ties-synagogue-shooter/1997391002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/10/29/USAT/b71c102d-8696-4fcb-b26c-2e0bb4e93f70-tree03.JPG?crop=1899,1063,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T11:35:20Z", "content": "Mourners visit the Tree of Life Synagogue on Oct. 29, 2018, in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh after 11 were killed and six others were wounded Saturday.

Clark, who resides in the Bloomingdale neighborhood.\n\nClark appeared in U.S. Court in D.C. on Tuesday where he was ordered held without bond. He faces two charges: one federal count of unlawful possession of firearms by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance and one District of Columbia count of possessing high-capacity magazines.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported on Clark\u2019s arrest.\n\nAccording to court documents, Clark was linked via social media to Robert Bowers, the man accused of killing 11 people inside a Pittsburgh synagogue in October, on the network Gab.\n\nGab has been the subject of much scrutiny since the shooting as Bowers was a frequent user of it and posted hateful messages on it.\n\nMore: Gab is back after site went offline for hate speech in wake of Pittsburgh shooting\n\nMore: What is Gab, the fringe social network used by Pittsburgh shooting suspect?\n\nCharging documents indicate that Clark called Bowers a \u201chero\u201d in one of his posts on it and used slurs against Jewish people.\n\nRelatives alerted authorities to Clark after the death by suicide of his brother, 23-year-old Edward \u201cTeddy\u201d Clark. Charging documents say Edward Clark killed himself on Roosevelt Island, on October 27, within hours of the deadly Pittsburgh massacre. Police recovered multiple rounds of ammunition at the scene. He did not leave a suicide note.\n\nRelatives told investigators that Jeffrey and Edward Clark were involved in the \u201calt-right\u201d movement and told them about the brothers\u2019 connection to Gab and the Pittsburgh shooter.\n\nAfter Edwards death, documents say Jeffrey Clark became more outspoken and \u201cagitated\u201d about his views, defending Bowers and telling relatives that he and his brother fantasized about killing \u201cJews and blacks,\u201d documents say.\n\nMore: Hate crimes in USA surge in 2017 with big jump in anti-Semitic attacks, FBI says\n\nThat\u2019s when relatives called police out of concern and two relatives went to Clark\u2019s house to confiscate his firearms. Investigators say of the four boxes Clark gave relatives, none contained firearms, but they did contain unregistered weapon pieces. Investigators wrote that these parts can be used to modify assault weapons.\n\nRelatives would later tell investigators that the brothers had attended the 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville and believed they were pictured next to the man who allegedly drove a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one woman.\n\nThey also told investigators the brothers believed in a \u201crace revolution,\u201d that they wanted to take part in.\n\nLater, Jeffrey Clark told relatives that the Pittsburgh victims \u201cdeserved it,\u201d the documents say.\n\nIn another chilling detail in the charging documents: Relatives told investigators that they believed Edward Clark intended to commit an act of violence on the day he died as he had additional ammunition.\n\nRelatives also told investigators that both brothers frequently smoked marijuana and possibly sold it.\n\nBetween the brothers, charging documents indicated that they owned four registered firearms: two handguns, a shotgun and a rifle. Three additional unregistered guns, a handgun, a shotgun, and a rifle, were also recovered from Clarks\u2019 home, as well as kits used to convert AR-15 rifles and four high-capacity AR-15 magazines, capable of holding up to 30 rounds of ammunition.\n\nOne of the registered handguns was used by Edward Clark when he died. None of these weapons could be modified by the pieces inside the four boxes relatives obtained.\n\nUpon his arrest, Clark told FBI agents that he and his brother purchased the firearms because they believed there would be a \u201ccivil war,\u201d documents say.\n\nThe weapons charge carries a maximum of 10 years in prison, while the ammunition charge carries a maximum of 1 year in prison. Both have potential financial penalties.\n\nIn the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting in October, nine faith-based organizations received nearly $1 million in funding from the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA for security. Meanwhile, one organization, Adas Israel, has made efforts to raise money for all synagogues in the area.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/14/man-arrested-d-c-had-alleged-online-ties-synagogue-shooter/1997391002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Ezra Miller shows off Killing Curse 'tattoo'", "description": "Wearing Givenchy couture, Ezra Miller, who plays Credence Barebone in the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise, talks about his outfit choice for \"The Crimes of Grindelwald\" London premiere and shows off his \"tattoos\" which spell out the Killing Curse.

(Photo: Scott Taetsch, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOf course, Jerry Jones just had to address the elephant in the room during a pregame chat with beleaguered coach, Jason Garrett.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not about to wilt on me, are you?\u201d the Dallas Cowboys owner asked Garrett, as he later recalled for USA TODAY Sports.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018No, I\u2019m just getting going.\u2019 \u201c\n\nTalk about pressure. As if pulling off an upset at Philadelphia wasn\u2019t enough for Garrett, a report last week declared that his bosses have an \u201caffinity\u201d for Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley. That's hardly the ideal look when considering that rumblings all season about Garrett\u2019s job status have enlivened the soap opera environment that might be titled, \u201cAs The Cowboys Turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a little brotherhood, because both of us are really getting criticized,\u201d Jones said, alluding to Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman\u2019s assertion that the dysfunctional organization needs widespread changes. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty critical when you have ownership of the team and they\u2019re telling you there needs to be an overhaul all the way through.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s going to make you get fainthearted, you\u2019ve picked the wrong spot. But that\u2019s kind of the tenor of the visit. I just said to him, \u2018Hearing all this stuff, it doesn\u2019t have you weak-kneed, does it?\u2019 \u201c\n\nThis underscores why Garrett, 72-60 (including a 1-2 playoff mark) in eight-plus seasons, has one of the toughest jobs in the NFL. He\u2019s overshadowed by the large persona of his team\u2019s owner/GM, which coincides with the glaring spotlight of the league\u2019s most popular team. Then again, that comes with the territory. It\u2019s the inconsistency of his team, which improved to 4-5 on Sunday, that fuels the hot-seat buzz.\n\nWhich brings us around to Riley, who trained Baker Mayfield and in just his second season as the Sooners\u2019 head coach has fast become a hot name as the next cycle of NFL coaching moves formulates \u2013 especially with his former quarterback's Cleveland Browns team needing a new leader after firing Hue Jackson.\n\nAsked if it\u2019s dangerous that Riley\u2019s name is already connected to the Cowboys while Garrett tries to rally the team into a playoff position, Jones said: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not dangerous. It\u2019s not frivolous. He\u2019s an outstanding coach and exceptional. He\u2019s had exceptional responsibility and success for where he is. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dangerous at all.\u201d\n\nAfter seven NFL teams switched coaches last offseason, figure on at least a half-dozen teams to make moves this time around, and that might be a conservative estimate.\n\nNo, Garrett is hardly alone in facing hot-seat questions.\n\nJust ask Rex Ryan, the twice-fired coach-turned-studio analyst. Ryan was adamant on ESPN in declaring that Jets coach Todd Bowles and GM Mike Maccagnan are on the way out.\n\nMore: Big bucks or big regret? Next contract will define Le'Veon Bell's gamble\n\nMore: Le'Veon Bell's 10 likeliest NFL landing spots in 2019\n\nMeanwhile, CBS Sports reported that John Harbaugh and the Ravens are headed toward a mutual parting after the season (which would mean he would likely wind up at the front of the line for another job). Harbaugh, like Garrett, trying to inspire his team on a second-half playoff push, dismissed the reports\u2026with humor.\n\nDuring a news conference this week, he injected a classic line from \"Animal House,\" saying it wasn\u2019t over \u201cwhen the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor.\u201d\n\nBut he knows, just as every coach in the NFL does: As difficult as it can be for the families of these coaches, the chatter and speculation will intensify for many of them as the season draws closer to its end.\n\nConsider this: In 2016, Doug Pederson was panned as the \u201cworst\u201d of the seven head coaching hires by several outlets. Yet Pederson now has a Super Bowl ring. When Jackson was dumped by the Browns, it meant more than half of that 2016 class of new coaches (including Chip Kelly, Mike Mularkey and Ben McAdoo) were out. And patience is clearly in the equation for two others in Adam Gase and Dirk Koetter.\n\nThese days, coaches may be lucky to get three years.\n\nThe bigger issue: Who\u2019s ready to take on a top job?\n\nProbably every team with a vacancy will be looking for the next Sean McVay, a young, innovative coach who can invigorate a franchise and seemingly provide the kind of long-term solution the Rams found in 2017. Before McVay, similar appeal \u2013 and ultimately success \u2013 was found by the Steelers with Mike Tomlin and by the Saints with Sean Payton. That\u2019s part of the reason there\u2019s intrigue with Riley, 35, who is 21-3 since promoted from his post as offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach.\n\nBut McVay, 32, the NFL\u2019s youngest coach, was groomed on the pro level. Riley\u2019s promise, bolstered by the pattern of NFL offenses increasingly incorporating college concepts, will come with the risk of whether his style will transition on the pro level.\n\nNonetheless, he seems bound to attract NFL attention, even though he has publicly maintained that he\u2019s not seeking such a jump at this point. He\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be the first to take that position. For several years, Stanford\u2019s David Shaw \u2013 who previously worked as an NFL assistant \u2013 has been on a short list of college coaches with NFL appeal. He hasn't been interested.\n\nNo, the next wave of NFL coaches will, as usual, largely come from the ranks of NFL assistants or former head coaches \u2013 Jim Caldwell? Jack Del Rio? \u2013 seeking another shot. Yet that can be tricky, too.\n\nRelatively fresh names on the rise that are popping up include John DeFilippo, the Vikings\u2019 new offensive coordinator, by way of Pederson\u2019s staff in Philadelphia; Eric Bieniemy, promoted to become the Chiefs\u2019 offensive coordinator after Matt Nagy landed with the Bears; Dan Campbell, the Saints\u2019 assistant head coach; Kris Richard, the Cowboys\u2019 defensive backs coach; and James Bettcher, the Giants\u2019 defensive coordinator who was runner-up to Steve Wilks for the Arizona job last offseason.\n\nGeorge Edwards? Perhaps the Vikings\u2019 defensive coordinator will become the next Mike Zimmer \u2013 a seasoned assistant who can make good when he finally gets a shot as the head man.\n\nMeanwhile, familiar candidates such as Josh McDaniels (the Patriots\u2019 offensive coordinator who backed out of the Colts job that eventually went to Frank Reich) and Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz will be mentioned. And the questions will beg: Are they better suited as coordinators?\n\nSee, there\u2019s nothing automatic about the pool of candidates\u2026or that the switch will pan out.\n\nBut one thing\u2019s for certain. There\u2019s no shortage of pressure.\n\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Lorenzo Reyes, USA TODAY", "title": "NFL QB Hot Sheet: Patrick Mahomes, Jared Goff square off in huge Chiefs-Rams matchup", "description": "Two of the game's top young passers -- Patrick Mahomes and Jared Goff -- square off in the intriguing Chiefs-Rams showdown in LA.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/14/nfl-qb-hot-sheet-chiefs-rams-jared-goff-patrick-mahomes/1995461002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/14/USAT/58a6448e-aaec-40b5-9657-887bcdbb5843-USATSI_11594158.jpg?crop=2206,1241,x1,y343&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T11:12:55Z", "content": "Patrick Mahomes squares off against Jared Goff in what promises to be an exciting game Monday night.

(Photo: Scott Galvin, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nEvery Wednesday during the NFL season, USA TODAY Sports will assess everyone's favorite topic: quarterbacks. Who's hot? Who's not? Who has the most exciting matchups?\n\nHere's this week's QB Hot Sheet:\n\nFive to watch this week\n\n1. Lamar Jackson/Joe Flacco, Ravens: If a hip injury forces Flacco out of Sunday\u2019s divisional, must-win game against the Bengals, Jackson will likely start. The first-round rookie\u2019s speed and running ability could spark a Ravens offense that has been flat \u2014 scoring just 18 points a game in a five-game span that has seen four losses. If Jackson shines, it could be a glimpse into Baltimore\u2019s future.\n\n2. Matthew Stafford, Lions: Though he has played well this season, Stafford still can\u2019t escape the occasional inconsistent performance. In a loss against the Bears, he completed just 59.5 percent of his throws and had two touchdowns and two interceptions. With a Panther defense that\u2019s tied for eighth with 15 turnovers forced, he\u2019ll need to protect the ball.\n\n3. Eli Manning, Giants: In response to whispers about his job being in danger, Manning posted his best game of the season in a Monday night victory over the 49ers. Now, with a Buccaneers defense that ranks dead last in scoring (32.3 points a game) coming into town, Manning (signed through 2019) needs to stack crisp performances to erase any doubt about his future in New York.\n\n4. Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs: One half of a scintillating matchup between two 9-1 teams, Mahomes has answered every question. He leads the league in yards (3,150) and passing scores (31) and infuses versatility into Kansas City\u2019s offense. The Rams' pass rush, however, is tied for ninth in the NFL with 26 sacks, so he might need to get the ball out quicker than usual than his average of 2.85 seconds (seventh-highest).\n\n5. Jared Goff, Rams: The other half, Goff ranks second in the NFL in yards (3,134) and continues to accurately and efficiently command L.A.\u2019s attack. This is a matchup of two of the top young passers in the league. Tune in on Monday night and enjoy.\n\nThree trending up\n\n1. Ben Roethlisberger, Steelers: He torched Carolina\u2019s defense to five touchdowns (versus only three incompletions) and a perfect passer rating. Pittsburgh is rolling.\n\n2. Mitchell Trubisky, Bears: Inconsistency aside, when Trubisky and the Bears are on, they\u2019re lethal. A healthy chemistry with receiver Allen Robinson (six catches for 133 yards and two touchdowns) highlighted an efficient day against the Lions.\n\n3. Baker Mayfield, Browns: Since Hue Jackson was fired and Freddie Kitchens became interim offensive coordinator, Mayfield has completed 74.2 percent of his passes for 513 yards and has thrown five touchdowns versus just one interception.\n\nThree trending down\n\n1. Andy Dalton, Bengals: Just 12 completions for 153 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions meant the Bengals \u2014 which needed to keep pace with the explosive Saints \u2014 had no shot in their blowout loss.\n\n2. Tom Brady, Patriots: Drops and inept pass protection bear some blame, but Brady still made poor decisions and had unusual misses on throws he normally completes in a loss against the Titans. Too early to say this is the beginning of the end for TB12, but his 51.2 percent completion rate in a loss against the Titans was by far the lowest of Week 10.\n\n3. Josh Rosen, Cardinals: When the O-line is as bad as Arizona\u2019s, it\u2019s hard to dump on the rookie. But just eight catches for 58 yards to wide receivers in a loss against the Chiefs is unacceptable. It\u2019s good Rosen and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich are using running back David Johnson in the passing game, but Rosen needs to build chemistry with his wideouts.\n\nSeason rankings\n\n1. Drew Brees (last week: 1): Saints: Another dominant performance in which he had as many incompletions (three) as TDs. His 21:1 TD-to-interception ratio is absurd.\n\n2. Mahomes (2): He broke Len Dawson\u2019s franchise record (29) for most touchdown passes in a single season. In Week 10. He\u2019s so talented and the scary thing is there are still areas where Mahomes can improve.\n\n3. Philip Rivers, Chargers (3): He posted an average game (18-26 for 223 yards, two touchdowns and one interception), but stays at No. 3 because of his work all season long. The margin behind him, though, is shrinking.\n\n4. Andrew Luck, Colts (5): Another exceptional performance was marred only by a pick that wasn\u2019t his fault. He\u2019s continuing a tremendous comeback campaign and hasn\u2019t been sacked in four straight games.\n\n5. Goff (NR): On pace to shatter career highs across major passing statistics, Goff spread the ball around and managed the game well against a tough Seahawks defense.\n\nDropped: Cam Newton (4).\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Buzz60\n\nThere are plenty of ways to tap those credit-card rewards to help you stay within your budget. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nAmericans expect to spend an average of more than $1,000 this holiday season. If that's your plan, too, let your credit-card points do some of the shopping instead. It's a strategy common among rewards cardholders.\n\n\"This is probably our customers' favorite time of year when it comes to rewards,\" says Tammy McIntosh, senior vice president of customer rewards at PNC Bank. \"They save throughout the year just for the holidays. That's when when we see redemptions just spike.\"\n\nThere are plenty of ways to tap those rewards to help you stay within your budget, McIntosh says. Remember that you may not always maximize the dollar value of your points, but it\u2019s better than emptying your wallet, or worse, racking up credit-card debt you can\u2019t pay off.\n\nHere are eight ways to use points to alleviate your holiday spending:\n\nPay with points\n\nSome retailers partner with credit-card rewards programs so you can pay for your purchase with points. For instance, you can use your American Express, Chase, Citi and Discover rewards for Amazon purchases. You can also use Amex rewards for online purchases at Staples, Walmart, Best Buy and Rite Aid, among others.\n\nYou can also use Citi points at Best Buy and 1-800-Flowers.com, but there\u2019s a hitch: You need to pay first with your card. The points are deducted later, and you get a statement credit within days of the purchase.\n\nGive the most popular gift\n\nThey may be impersonal, but gift cards are consistently the most popular and most-requested present for at least a decade, according to the National Retail Federation, a trade association. They are also practical and easy to send.\n\nMost credit-card rewards programs allow you to redeem your points or rewards for gift cards from major retailers, often at a discount.\n\nMcIntosh sees procrastinators take advantage of sending digital gift cards at the last minute. Others redeem their points for a card and use it themselves at the store to buy presents for loved ones, she says.\n\nMore Money: Was Amazon's headquarters search 'a giant ruse'? NYC, D.C. centers of power prevail\n\nMore Money: Chick-fil-A announces nationwide delivery with DoorDash and 200,000 free chicken sandwiches\n\nMore Money: Amazon\u2019s HQ2 will bring 25,000 jobs each to New York City and Northern Virginia\n\nMaximize your spending\n\nIf you don\u2019t have enough points, here\u2019s a way to supercharge getting rewards while you shop. Instead of purchasing directly from a retailer\u2019s website, go through your credit-card\u2019s online shopping portal where you can shop at major stores such as Banana Republic and Best Buy. When you buy through the portal, you earn extra rewards points. You can use those later for a statement credit to reduce your total spending.\n\nBuy from your card issuer\n\nBrowse your card issuer\u2019s merchandise catalog for possible gift ideas. These catalogs often feature luggage, jewelry, electronics and even toys that can be bought using rewards or points. Generally, you ultimately pay more for these items than if you purchased them directly from a store. But if you have no other use for your rewards and need to stick to a budget, this is a convenient way to do it.\n\nGive an experience\n\nFor those recipients on your list that have everything already, buy an experience with your rewards. For instance, get concert or other event tickets from Live Nation using your Citi ThankYou points, or from TicketMaster using your American Express rewards.\n\n\"We see customers will use rewards to book travel, but not for holiday time,\" McIntosh. \"They book a Disney cruise and give that as a gift that maybe doesn\u2019t happen until February.\"\n\nThe gift of you\n\nIf you promise to \u201cbe home for Christmas,\u201d use rewards to get there. Points can be used to book a hotel near family or fly your special someone to you. If you don\u2019t have enough to cover a flight, some issuers, such as Citi and American Express, let you use rewards to pay for some or all of a purchase on Expedia.com. Capital One cardholders also can use rewards they earn during the holidays to pay for travel purchases they made 90 days before.\n\nGive back instead of gifting\n\nEmbrace the spirit of the season and donate your points in your loved one\u2019s name. It\u2019s tax-deductible, too. Most issuers allow this, but some offer more options than others. For example, you can choose from more than a million charities to donate your American Express rewards to. But you can donate to only three charities with your Citi card: American Red Cross Disaster Relief, American Red Cross International Services and Smile Train, a not-for-profit that provides cleft repair surgery in developing countries.\n\nSimply get cash back\n\n\"The fallback is just redeeming for cash. They can go out and buy a gift or travel and redeem for cash,\" McIntosh says. \"It still feels pretty rewarding because that cash didn\u2019t come out of their wallet or their budget.\"\n\nCLOSE If you\u2019re sharing you're credit card, your likely to wind up with a losing hand.

(Photo: James Quigg, The Victor Valley Daily Press, via AP)\n\nRising casualties. Aerial assaults. Weary ground forces. The charred desolation of thousands of homes. The most apt metaphor about California's rampaging wildfires is warfare.\n\nAnd just like in any war, one of the first casualties is truth.\n\nWho or what is to blame for the conflagrations? Whether it's timber interests on one side complaining about environmental rules, or environmentalists on the other side claiming it's all about global warming, neither faction has it completely right.\n\nEven as the tragedy was unfolding, President Donald Trump weighed in on the side of lumber interests, threatening \"no more fed payments\" because of \"gross mismanagement of the forests.\"\n\nWhat federal payments he's tweeting about is anyone's guess, and 57 percent of California's forested area is owned by the federal government. If the president has a beef with how those areas are managed, he should take it up with his own administration and properly fund forest management programs.\n\nOpposing view: How to fight California's wildfires? It's an 'all of the above' response\n\nThere might, indeed, be a need to make it easier to thin dying or dead trees out of densely forested areas, reducing the fuel for wildfires. But the problem is actually more complicated. Even if dead logs are stripped away, the tinder-dry brush acts like kindling when wildfires spread.\n\nEven more to the point, dense forests were not a factor in these recent California fires. \"They're using these fires to talk about forest management that has nothing to do with the landscape in which the fires are occurring,\" says Char Miller, W.M. Keck Professor of Environmental Analysis and History at Pomona College in Claremont, California.\n\nThe Camp Fire 90 miles north of Sacramento that killed about 50 people, destroyed nearly 8,000 homes, devastated the city of Paradise, and cindered 117,000 acres \u2014 making it the state's most destructive fire ever \u2014 burned through a mix of trees, brush and grassland. And fires that forced massive evacuations outside Los Angeles fed off of chaparral or brush.\n\nClimate change is making wildfires worse. The resulting erratic weather patterns have created shorter, wetter winters in California, producing a sudden, heavy growth of shrubs, grasses and trees. After winter, the state's ongoing drought and record-high summer temperatures draw moisture out of the plants, rendering them near-perfect kindling. With the hot and dry Santa Ana winds of fall, fires explode out of control.\n\nYet these tragedies can't be blamed solely on global warming. Wildfires are actually a vital part of the state's ecosystem. Lodgepole pines, for example, thrive in fire-prone areas where millions of structures have been erected in rural areas of California since the 1940s. When they burn, the cost in lives and treasure soars.\n\nAnswering these disasters with a clipped, one-dimensional solution helps no one, although it might score short-term political points.\n\nThe proper response includes placing limits on, and fireproofing, residential expansion into wildlands; better management and removal of dry brush; and relentlessly addressing the growing concern of climate change.\n\nIn other words, the solution isn't either/or. It's all of the above.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

(Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWildfires will occur. The question becomes what can we do to minimize the size and effect. Recent fires have become exponentially more destructive. Fires of this size and intensity are an incredibly serious threat to our lives, property and environment, and should not be accepted as the new normal.\n\nSeveral factors may be at play, but improper forest fuel management is a clear problem.\n\nThere is now a nearly limitless supply of fuel \u2014 dead trees, drybrush and vegetation \u2014 making our forests combustible as ever. There are 129 million dead trees in California. A healthy forest should have an inventory of 60 to 80 trees per acre; ours have several hundred per acre.\n\nCommon-sense forest policies that will treat overgrown lands and prevent a manageable wildfire from turning into a catastrophic inferno are long overdue. We need a streamlined process to responsibly thin forests, especially public lands. Our forestry professionals need to be out in the forests, assessing and doing their work, not spending half their time filling out paperwork, responding to activist-funded environmental litigation.\n\nOur view: How to fight California's wildfires? It's an 'all of the above' response\n\nWe also need to reverse the loss of forest product infrastructure critical to restoration efforts, including timber harvest, hazardous fuel reduction, salvage logging, prescribed burning and the mill capacity to handle it.

Buzz60\n\nCandy corn lover Randy Scott poses in his Salisbury home on Monday, Nov 12, 2018. (Photo: Staff Photo by Jenna Miller)\n\nDestiny may be to blame for Ashley Mock's infatuation with Pumpkin Spice Lattes. The 36-year-old public relations executive is a lifelong resident of a city that's called PSL for short: Port St. Lucie.\n\nThe Floridian buys a Starbucks PSL every single day on her way to work \u2013 and sometimes goes back in the afternoon for an iced version. At $5.45 for each 20-ounce cup, she spends a minimum of $27.25 a week for as long as they last, approximately three months.\n\nBefore you go and mock her, know that Mock is not alone. Millions of Americans go ga-ga over seasonal flavors from the iconic coffee drink that ushered in the Age of Pumpkin Spice \u2013 think beer, Twinkies and Cheerios \u2013 to candy corn-inspired popcorn and Hershey bars to eggnog-flavored tea and Publix ice cream. All that adds up to hundreds of millions of dollars in sales for the companies that sell the foods.\n\nMore: 401(k) account balances hit record high of $106,500; where do you stack up?\n\nMore: List of Lowe's stores closing: 20 stores will shut doors in US next year\n\nMore: For best burger-eating results, try turning it upside-down\n\nMock is so friendly with her local Starbucks manager that he lets her know in advance when Pumpkin Spice Latte season is starting. When it's ending, she trades the real thing for the PSL Christmas ornament her brother gave her and a mug that teases her with \"This might be pumpkin spice\" written on the front.\n\n\"All of my friends know I\u2019m obsessed. As Facebook memes start to pop up that time of year, everyone tags me. I have a problem, but I don't really have a problem,\" she said. \"The way I justified it to my husband is it makes me happy to do it. I feel I work hard and if that\u2019s what makes me happy, so be it.\"\n\nDevoted super-fans will go far to feed their obsession for fall-flavored foods \u2013and manufacturers and chain restaurants know it. They're motivated by the desire to drum up business from both existing devotees and consumers who like to sample new products. Sometimes, they even serve as gateway foods to convert new customers to other items in a company's line-up. Come in for the candy-cane-infused cookie and leave with the year-round staple pound cake.\n\nThese now-you-see-them-now-you-don\u2019t foods make for great bait. Few things motivate customers to buy like a limited-time offer, which is essentially what seasonally flavored foods are.\n\n\"What they\u2019re doing is creating this idea of scarcity,\" said David Henkes, senior principal for Technomic, a Chicago-based food industry consulting firm. \"You're heightening that demand by having it available only for a short time. The fact that it disappears after a month or two or three focuses the consumer.\"\n\nIt's not just an autumn move. Quick-hit products are available in blips all year round, such as the Arby's duck sandwich, Sonic's Pickle Juice Slush and the McDonald's McRib sandwich, various ice cream brands' Girl Scout cookie flavors and the expanding array of maple-infused foods.\n\nHowever, temporary offerings mean changes that complicate inventory and supply chains.\n\n\"It's definitely worth it, because you're really getting consumers to come to visit or pay attention to you when other parts of (your) message may get lost in the noise of promotion or marketing or advertising,\" Henkes said, adding that season-linked offers lead to increased sales as well as a boost in brand awareness.\n\nThe artificial sense of urgency they create lights a fire in food fans. Randy Scott is always on the lookout for deals on candy corn, specifically the Brach's brand, which he can find only this time of year. He calls it \"a good obsession\" and once was gifted 12 bags by a store near his office, aware of his dedication to the tri-colored niblets.\n\nScott buys about 45 bags a year to feed a love he's had since childhood and remains unimpressed with all candy corn-flavored foods, except Oreos.\n\n\"I\u2019ve tried a few things here and there, but nothing ever lives up to original candy corn. They try to take advantage of us candy corn lovers,\" said the 37-year-old radio personality from Salisbury, Maryland. \"There's a bag and a half in a secret-but-not-so-secret cabinet. It moves when the kids find out.\"\n\nThe fear of missing out \u2013 or FOMO for short \u2013 is a strong instigator, according to experts. Plus, scarcity can create the perception that something's more valuable or appealing.\n\n\"When it's predictable, it\u2019s even better, because you can plan for it and anticipate it and then, you can savor the opportunity to have it,\" said Edward Hirt, an Indiana University Bloomington psychology professor who's an expert on fandom. \"Some people will take advantage of it as long as they can. They go back multiple times and buy out the store of those limited-supply items, so they can enjoy themselves pumpkin-flavored whatever.\"\n\nAnd then, it comes to an end. At least until next year. The fun is over and the feeling of specialness dissipates. For those enamored with fall flavors, that happens once the trees are bare; and for the self-described \"nog hogs,\" it's after the start of the new year.\n\nAs Pumpkin Spice Lattes start to fade, Mock described herself feeling \"totally sad.\"\n\n\"I distinctly remember last year asking for one and they were out. They were gone, and I was really upset,\" Mock said.\n\nAt least until they return again the next year.\n\nCLOSE See what might be hiding in the popular fall treat.

AP VoteCast also shows a majority of voters considered President Donald Trump a factor in their votes. (Nov. 6) AP\n\nRepublicans can work with Democrats on health care or keep attacking the ACA. What they decide will affect real people and the 2020 presidential race.\n\nIn Covington, Ky., on Nov. 6, 2018. (Photo: Meg Vogel/The Cincinnati Enquirer/USA TODAY Network)\n\nHealth care has been on the ballot as much as any policy issue in every election since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. Until last week, the Republican Party defined itself by its opposition to the law and prospered from its years-long campaign to repeal it.\n\nExit polls show that in 2018 once again, health care was the major concern on the ballot and helped drive the highest midterm election turnout on record. And this time it was Republicans who paid the heavy price. They lost more than 15 percent of their House seats, including a number of long-time incumbents who played pivotal roles in repeal like Reps. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey and Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, and Arizona Rep. Martha McSally (who lost her Senate bid).\n\nIn the months before the election, the signs of what was coming were increasingly clear to Republicans. The bombastic 2017 rhetoric of ACA repeal gave way to professions of newfound support for preserving coverage protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, one of the core tenets of the ACA.\n\nHealth care is now a Republican liability\n\nWhether this late ACA religion was genuine or just put on for the election, the political reality was clear to everyone. Combined with the new Democratic majority in the House, it\u2019s fair to wonder if a new health care agenda is possible in the next two years.\n\nThe health care debate will play out in four key arenas \u2014 Congress, the Trump administration, the states and the 2020 campaign. Start with this. It is clear for the first time since Donald Trump became president that there are no longer the votes to repeal the ACA.\n\n\n\nBoth parties in Congress will be wise to find the areas of commonality and work on some of the issues that resonate with the general public. House Democrats will propose common sense bills to improve affordability and enhance stability on the insurance exchanges. How Republicans respond to these proposals will have a lot to do with whether health care remains a potent liability for them.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration is likely to be a bigger influence than Congress on whether health care continues to be a top public concern. Since ACA repeal was defeated, there\u2019s been an internal battle inside the administration between some who would like to continue to damage or end the ACA and others who, while still opposing the law, argue for doing their duty and managing it with minimal disruption.\n\nMore: Democrats flipped the House, now they need to stop being Eeyores and flip the script\n\nVote your fears on health care, not caravan 'crisis' hyped by Trump and Republicans\n\nTrump and his team fight for health consumers, starting with drug price transparency\n\nA critical test for the Trump administration is whether to drop support for a frivolous lawsuit to invalidate the ACA, currently being pushed by 20 Republican state attorneys general. If that lawsuit continues, expect the voters who became so active this year to keep health care on the front burner.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to 2020, Republicans would prefer to make the next election a referendum on single payer health care, such as Medicare for All, than on the ACA and pre-existing conditions. That will be a tough sell, particularly if they are continuing to attack the ACA.\n\n\n\nFor 2020, expect Democrats to strongly embrace the universal coverage principle favored by the majority of Americans. There will be different versions from different presidential candidates, from some who would like to see a Medicare-like plan for all to others who would adopt one of several plans to make Medicare or Medicaid available to anyone, but allow people to keep private coverage if they like. I expect candidates to embrace an \u201cany of the above\u201d approach by pushing multiple options and, heeding the lessons of the past, to be cautious about disrupting employer based coverage.\n\nLook to the states for progress on health care\n\nStates are where we should see the most progress and glimpses of how a better health care system might look. Romneycare became a reality in Massachusetts before Congress passed Obamacare. Many states are taking lessons from the election that Americans want more health security for themselves and their neighbors, and expect politicians to get on board.\n\nThree red states \u2014 Utah, Nebraska and Idaho \u2014 put Medicaid expansion on the ballot after their governments refused to act. It passed in all three. Kansas, which elected a Democratic governor, is also likely to expand Medicaid next year.\n\n\n\nOther states are looking to test more far-reaching ideas. Watch New Mexico, Illinois, Minnesota and Connecticut as they consider a public option. States like North Carolina, a purple state with innovative leadership, are embracing ideas like adding social services and integrated mental health care into Medicaid. Others will take action on prescription drug costs or issues like surprise medical bills.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, some states will head the other direction, imposing new requirements to qualify for coverage. The Trump administration has championed these approaches \u2014 whether it's new paperwork to prove people are working or threats to legal residents that using legal benefits could hamper their ability to become citizens.\n\n\n\nDemocrats should be willing to spend their new political advantage by inviting Republicans to help them finally build on the gains of the last decade and fix the shortcomings of the ACA. Politically, it would make sense for Republicans to finally roll up their sleeves and argue for inclusion of some of their ideas to improve health security, quality and affordability.\n\n\n\nThe battle over health care is one Americans would like to see end. What's different now is they've proven with their votes that if politicians keep up the attacks on their health care, they are at dire risk of defeat.\n\nAndy Slavitt, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the Affordable Care Act and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017.

May confirmed the development during a short statement outside No. 10 Downing Street, the British leader's official residence.\n\n\"I firmly believe, with my head and my heart that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom,\" she said, referring to the support from her Cabinet as a \"collective agreement.\" She didn\u2019t say whether the deal received unanimous backing.\n\nSecuring Cabinet approval was an important step for May, but the deal still needs approval from the EU at a summit in the next few weeks. Then May will need to win backing from Britain's Parliament, where pro-Brexit and pro-EU legislators alike are threatening to oppose it. A disorderly exit from the EU is still a possibility.\n\nBritain is due to leave the bloc in March. On Tuesday, it broke a four-month-long logjam with EU negotiators over the terms of its withdrawal, including a plan to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open after Brexit.\n\nBut pro-Brexit lawmakers in May\u2019s divided Conservative Party are angry, saying the agreement will leave Britain tethered to the EU after it departs the bloc. Failure to secure Cabinet backing would have left May\u2019s leadership in doubt and Brexit in chaos.\n\n\"Theresa May\u2019s Brexit agreement is the worst deal in history,\" Nigel Farage, the British politician and broadcaster who helped engineer the June 2016 Brexit vote, tweeted. Farage represents Britain in the European Parliament in Brussels.\n\nMay herself told lawmakers earlier Wednesday that the draft deal \"takes us significantly closer to delivering what the British people voted for\" when they decided to leave the bloc. She said the deal means that Britain will \"take back control\" of its laws and borders \"while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of our United Kingdom.\"\n\nBritain's former Foreign Secretary William Hague said a failure to back the draft deal could have led to a new Brexit referendum and even a general election.\n\n\"It would probably mean a different government,\" Hague said in a BBC radio interview. He add that another Brexit referendum \"might not resolve matters\" that if it did happen it would be \"the most divisive and bitter political conflict in this country in 100 years, and very economically damaging.\"\n\nBritain voted to leave the EU by 52 percent to 48 percent in the vote. Some polling data indicate that if there were a second Brexit vote a majority would chose to stay in the EU. May has repeatedly rejected the idea of holding a second vote.\n\nMay is expected to give a statement to Parliament on Thursday. Aspects of the deal that will be detailed in the coming days include Britain's trade relationship with the EU and what rights the 3.8 million EU nationals who live in Britain will retain after the divorce.\n\nMore: How much is Brexit costing Brits?

In the appeal, Hayes\u2019s attorneys say the judge in the case should have granted a new trial because a witness who contacted the defense a day after Hayes' conviction said he had heard two guns at the time of the shooting. (Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office via AP, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A defense attorney for the man convicted of killing retired New Orleans Saints star Will Smith in 2016 has told a Louisiana appellate court that his client deserves a new trial, in part because of evidence that surfaced after trial that he said lends credibility to Cardell Hayes' self-defense assertion.\n\nHayes' appeal attorney, Paul Barker, told three 4th Circuit Court of Appeal judges Wednesday that New Orleans prosecutors failed to disprove that Hayes acted in self-defense. Hayes is serving a 25-year sentence for manslaughter in Smith's death and attempted manslaughter in the wounding of Smith's wife during a confrontation following a traffic collision in April 2016.\n\nHayes insisted at trial that he fired after a drunk, angry Smith retrieved a gun from his car and fired first.\n\nBarker said none of a host of witnesses had a clear view of everything that happened amid the tumult following the accident in New Orleans' Lower Garden District.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Kyle Daly countered that Hayes was alone among witnesses in saying Smith brandished a gun or fired it. A semi-automatic handgun was found loaded but unused in Smith's car. And while Barker said gunfire residue on Smith's body raises doubt that he never fired, Daly said it was consistent with being shot at close-range with a larger weapon.\n\nIt was unclear when the three-judge appellate panel would rule.\n\nBarker argued that trial judge Camille Buras should have granted a new trial because a witness who contacted the defense a day after Hayes' conviction said he had heard two gun fire from two weapons at the time of the shooting.\n\nThe witness, military veteran Michael Burnside, delivered rambling and at times profane testimony at a post-trial hearing last year. Daly argued that he wasn't credible. Burnside lived blocks from the shooting scene and, Daly argued, his testimony indicated a series of shots fired at a slower rate than the rapid-fire shooting Hayes had described.\n\nParker also contends the trial judge should have allowed testimony about Smith's 2010 arrest on a domestic abuse charge after former Saint Deuce McAllister spoke of Smith's sterling reputation among his teammates and friends.\n\nSmith was arrested outside a southwest Louisiana bar in 2011 on misdemeanor charges of domestic abuse battery and public intoxication. Lafayette Parish prosecutors dropped the charges in 2012 after Smith completed community service and participated in counseling.\n\nDaly argued that Buras was right to avoid what would have amounted to a \"mini-trial on the Lafayette incident.\"\n\nSmith, a 34-year-old father of three, was a defensive leader on the Saints team that lifted spirits in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005. He helped carry the team to a winning season in 2006 and a Super Bowl victory four years later.\n\nHayes was 29 when he was convicted in December 2016. He owned a tow-truck business, had played semi-pro football and is the father of a young son.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It would be funny if it weren\u2019t so tragic. Yet apparently, these men need a code of conduct to know not to shield rapists. And they need time to reach universal consensus on a proposal that would simply ask bishops to promise not to lead a \u201cdouble life.\u201d\n\nIn denial about long-running, far-reaching rot\n\nNo one can accuse me of being hasty.

That\u2019s when a man I thought I knew pretty well, a man who unlike other church leaders amid the abuse scandals of 2002 seemed to understand the depth of the damage done, was himself disgraced.\n\nAfter \u201ccredible and substantiated\u201d allegations that the now former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had taken advantage of seminarians, assaulted an altar boy in 1971 and even, because evil knows no shame, abused the first child he had ever baptized, the accused was shipped off to the quiet of a Kansas friary \u2014 thanks so much for thinking of us out here on the prairie! \u2014 to pray, repent and, so far, stick to his story that he has done nothing wrong.\n\nMore: Three ways Catholics can fight sexual abuse in the church\n\nTrump is not 'the most pro-life president' ever. He proves the opposite every day.\n\nWhy \u2014 despite sexual abuse scandal \u2014 I am still a faithful Catholic\n\nThen in August, we got the Pennsylvania grand jury report detailing more than 1,000 cases of abuse by more than 300 priests over seven decades. Across the country, other states have launched similar investigations, so all the hiding, stalling, law- and commandment-breaking ends here: Basta.\n\nAlready, in a joint investigation, The Boston Globe and The Philadelphia Inquirer have found that more than 130 American bishops \u2014 almost a third of all of those still living \u2014 have been accused of failing to deal appropriately with sexual misconduct by priests in their dioceses at some point in their careers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked by that number,\u201d Boston\u2019s Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, who really is the top clerical abuse adviser to Pope Francis, told The Globe. \u201cIt raises a lot of questions in my mind.\u2019\u2019\n\nI\u2019m shocked that he\u2019s shocked, and his surprise answers a couple of questions in my mind: After all these years, is this really the level of understanding of how long-running and far-reaching the rot was and is? And if this is the cardinal who is most on the case on this matter, is it any wonder we are where we are?\n\nThe church fell asleep. For a century.\n\nThe Globe and Inquirer found that more than 50 bishops have done the wrong thing in this regard even after the 2002 Dallas conference, at which they agreed to a no-tolerance policy for priests but left themselves completely free of oversight on the new child protection policies they were supposed to enforce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inexplicable,\u201d O\u2019Malley said of the transgressions of so many bishops even in recent years. \u201cI mean, anybody at this point in history who would not understand the consequences of not embracing zero tolerance and transparency \u2014 I cannot understand that.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe men who run the church continue to think so well of one another that I sometimes wonder whether they have met.\n\nDiNardo recounted that it happened this way: \u201cIn our weakness,\u2019\u2019 he said in Baltimore, \u201cwe fell asleep.\u201d Not so much like Peter in the garden, though. More like Rip Van Winkle, and for a century instead of 20 years.\n\nWhen and if the bishops do fully rouse themselves, I won\u2019t be in the pews to hear about it.\n\nI am a true-believing, rosary- and novena-praying graduate of St. Mary's Elementary School, the University of Notre Dame and l'Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain in Belgium.

Madison, which granted the Supreme Court judicial review, but agrees when it comes to New Deal legislation.\n\nMatthew Whitaker in Johnston, Iowa, on April 24, 2014. (Photo: Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nIn a widely reported 2014 interview, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker criticized Marbury v. Madison, perhaps the most celebrated Supreme Court decision in American history. He also criticized the Court\u2019s decisions upholding important New Deal legislation like the Social Security and Fair Labor Standards Acts. These comments have provoked rebukes of Whitaker\u2019s extremism and ignorance of constitutional law, but almost no one has taken them seriously.\n\nThat is a mistake. At least for the time being, Whitaker is the nation\u2019s highest ranking law enforcement officer. Besides the president and Supreme Court justices, perhaps no federal official wields more power over Americans\u2019 rights and liberties than the attorney general. If Whitaker still holds the views he expressed in 2014, the implications are profoundly troubling.\n\nStart with Marbury v. Madison. This 1803 decision is the canonical source for the Supreme Court\u2019s power to declare federal legislation \u2014 and other governmental acts \u2014 unconstitutional. Although Marbury\u2019s immediate impact on constitutional doctrine was modest, by the early twentieth century, the case had acquired its reputation as the very cornerstone of American constitutional law.\n\nWhitaker's ideas may lead to constitutional crisis\n\nWhitaker\u2019s attack on Marbury was thus an attack on the Supreme Court\u2019s well-established power to authoritatively resolve constitutional disputes.\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker will have the means to put his contempt for the Court into action. First, he could refuse to enforce the decisions of the Supreme Court or other federal courts. Second, he could order the Justice Department, which includes the FBI, to defy court orders in cases that declare its actions unconstitutional. Either would spark a genuine constitutional crisis.\n\nRecall the travel ban cases. Last June, the Supreme Court upheld a revised version of President Trump\u2019s January 2017 order that critics called a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d But the original order was far more punitive and several lower courts immediately barred its enforcement. If Whitaker had been acting attorney general at the time, he might have employed a variation of Andrew Jackson\u2019s apocryphal dictum: \u201cThe courts have made their decision. Now let them enforce it.\u201d\n\nMore: Sessions firing marks end of Mueller deniability for Republicans. Which side are we on?\n\nTrump didn't realize Sessions was helping him by recusing. Now he'll pay for that mistake.\n\nHere are 5 reasons why Matthew Whitaker isn't attorney general material\n\nThe term \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d is often thrown around loosely. But this scenario would meet even the most rigorous definition of the term.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s disdain for the New Deal cases is nearly as alarming. These decisions were the product of the nation\u2019s last great constitutional showdown between Franklin Roosevelt and a Supreme Court bent on hog-tying the federal government in the midst of the Great Depression. Eventually, the Court backed down, upholding the Social Security Act and Fair Labor Standards Act. In the subsequent 80 years, the justices have placed a few modest limits on the outer reaches of federal legislative power, but they have never come close to reconsidering the core of the Court\u2019s New Deal decisions.\n\nThose decisions provide the constitutional foundations for federal laws ranging from the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 and a whole lot more. By attacking them, Whitaker was signaling sympathy with an extreme conservative legal philosophy that views most of the modern federal government as illegitimate and unconstitutional.\n\nWhitaker's judicial review position is incoherent\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker could refuse to defend any or all of these laws against constitutional challenge. This would not be quite as dramatic as defying a court order. Private parties and the soon-to-be Democratic House of Representatives would step in to defend them. But such a refusal would still shake the federal government to its very foundations.\n\nThere is one last, ironic wrinkle. Whitaker\u2019s skepticism of Marbury implies that he believes other branches are better at constitutional interpretation than the Supreme Court. But his rejection of the New Deal cases is actually a call for more aggressive judicial review. This not only makes Whitaker\u2019s position deeply incoherent; it demonstrates his own ineptitude at constitutional analysis, further reinforcing the need for judicial oversight of the executive branch on his watch.\n\nOf course, Whitaker may not act on his dangerous views. Other pressing issues will demand his attention, and the weighty responsibilities of power often temper ill-considered views expressed from the sidelines. Political factors, too, may lead him to chart a more prudent course. Even if they do not, resistance from within the Justice Department and other figures in its senior leadership could well thwart any truly radical designs. Whitaker\u2019s appointment is also temporary, and he may be replaced by a less dangerous figure before he has time to do serious damage.\n\nBut these potential brakes on his extremism are no cause for complacency. The stakes are too high. Whitaker\u2019s appointment is nominally temporary, but federal law allows him to serve for up to 210 days \u2014 and even longer if Trump sends a nomination to the Senate during that period.

ORIG FILE ID: AFP_1AT7X0 (Photo: JIM YOUNG, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCorrection & clarification: An earlier version of the story misstated where Oprah Winfrey is from. She was born in Mississippi.\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 Michelle Obama went back to her roots Tuesday night, taking over Chicago's United Center for the first night of her book tour for her new memoir, \"Becoming.\"\n\nA little more than 10 years to the day after igniting the city with hope on the night of the 2008 presidential election, the former first lady sat in conversation with another powerful woman with Chicago ties \u2013 Oprah Winfrey \u2013 who chose the memoir as her latest book club pick (and apparently was one of the first people to read it outside of Obama's family).\n\nThe two delved deeper into vignettes from the book, discussing everything from life in the White House and motherhood to owning her seat at the table and her relationship with her husband, Barack Obama.\n\nHere are the most poignant moments and revelations from the first night of the book tour:\n\nShe broke down sobbing right after the 2016 inauguration\n\nObama revealed that the moment she boarded the Marine One helicopter after the 2016 inauguration, she broke down crying.\n\n\"I didn't write about this in the book, because I had forgotten about it. ... When I got on the plane I think I sobbed for 30 minutes,\" she said. \"And I think it was just the release of eight years of trying to do everything perfectly. I said to Barack: 'That was so hard. What we just did was so hard, and I've wanted to say that for eight years.' \"\n\n\"I saw sameness, and that was the first time it struck me that this is going to be different,\" Obama said of the people on the stage at President Donald Trump's inauguration. \"And then I listened to the speech and said, 'This is going to be really different.' \"\n\nShe also said she joked about getting on the presidential plane after the inauguration, turning around and mouthing \"Bye, Felicia.\"\n\n\"I didn't do it,\" she said, sparking a roar of laughter from the crowd.\n\nMore: Michelle Obama talks 2020 Trump challengers, gives update on Malia and Sasha\n\nShe talked more about her trip to marriage counseling\n\nObama said she initially went into marriage counseling with the idea that the counselor would tell her husband to \"fix himself.\"\n\n\"I wanted to bring him in to have another person tell him 'Get yourself together,' \" she joked.\n\nShe said some of their issues arose when they started on their first joint project: parenting.\n\n\"What I learned about myself was that it's not my partner's job to make me happy; we have to make each other happy,\" she said. \"There's a part of me that was waiting for him to do for me, and I didn't need him to do it, I needed it done. I was having arguments not about it getting done but about him doing it.\"\n\nMore: Michelle Obama reveals she struggled to conceive, used IVF to have Malia and Sasha\n\nMalia and Sasha made a virtual cameo appearance\n\nThe Obama daughters, Malia, 20, and Sasha, 17, showed up to support their mom's new book in a video before the show.\n\nOn election night in 2008, \"I remember the night in Chicago; people were just so happy,\" Malia said. \"I think seeing other people cry and scream in a way highlighted how insane it was that that just happened.\"\n\nSaid Sasha: \"It's just insane to see thousands of people in one room so excited and so inspired by one person, and that person happens to be your mom. I think I'm most excited for her to be proud of what she's done and look at how many lives she's touched, because I think that's the most important thing.\"\n\nBarack Obama made a video appearance, too, talking about the first time he met Michelle. Turns out, he probably didn't make the best first impression.\n\n\"I had never taken the train downtown before. It was raining that day. I wasn't fully equipped with an umbrella,\" he said. \"The bottom line is, when I walk into Michelle's office, not only am I late, I'm also kind of damp. So it's not clear whether I made the best impression.\"\n\nShe told Oprah her prayer for people's 'Becoming' moment\n\nWhen Winfrey asked the former first lady what she hopes for the people who are \"becoming\" themselves in the spirit of the book, Obama kept things simple: She hopes people can connect through shared stories.\n\n\"Truly, our stories are not in our DNA or in something that happened with our great-great-great-great grandfathers,\" she said. \"The truth of our stories are in the memories that we hold in our heads.\n\n\"What I wish for people is that they understand the value in their day-to-day stories and help to use that to figure out how you got to where you are.\n\n\"The R, the D, that doesn't matter, race doesn't matter, color doesn't matter. Who we pray to, who we love, that truly doesn't matter,\" she said. \"What binds us are these stories, and if we can find it in ourselves and understand the value in our stories, we can connect.\n\nShe described her story as 'quintessentially' American\n\nObama said that although her book is personal and has stories that are specific to her, it is one many people can relate to.\n\n\"The one thing that I am claiming is that my story is the quintessential American story,\" she said. \"Yes, I'm black, yes; I'm a woman, yes; I grew up working-class; and yes; my parents didn't get to finish college. That is part of the American dream. This story is it.\n\n\"So how dare somebody tell me that I don't belong, that I don't love my country? How dare somebody tell me that I don't have a right to have a voice?\n\n\"My story does matter,\" she said. \"I love my story. it is the American story. My struggles, my journey, my small house on the South Side of Chicago, my father with a disability, all of that makes me more valuable to the conversation, not less.\"\n\nMore: 'Becoming Michelle Obama': What we learned from the former first lady's ABC News interview\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/14/michelle-obama-becoming-moments-chicago-tour-stop-oprah/1997163002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Once Texas' breakout QB, Heard quietly ending career as WR", "description": "Once upon a time, Texas wide receiver Jerrod Heard had \"the juice\" as the Longhorns quarterback of the future", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/14/once-texas-breakout-qb-heard-quietly-ending-career-as-wr/38523983/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/52f513425cd929c54c867f22950c3b72ce7f4851/c=0-160-2700-1679/local/-/media/2018/11/14/USATODAY/usatsports/793f308fbfe14a3c96054b1b195f30f7.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T07:38:44Z", "content": "FILE - In this Saturday, April 21, 2018 file photo, Texas wide receiver Jerrod Heard (13) is hit by defensive back Jarmarquis Durst (28) after making a catch during the NCAA college football team's Orange-White spring game in Austin, Texas.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Once upon a time, Jerrod Heard had the \"juice.\"\n\nHe was the quarterback of the future for the Texas Longhorns and he'd just smashed Vince Young's single-game school record with 527 total yards against California. He could throw. He could run. He could do just about everything.\n\nThen all that juice dried up with a whole lot of losing. A fifth-year senior, Heard heads into his final home game this week against No. 18 Iowa State (6-3, 5-2 Big 12) as a fifth-option wide receiver and special teams guy for the No. 13 Longhorns (7-3, 5-2).\n\nBut he's still got the record. And he's earned a whole lot of respect from his teammates for stepping up with a career-high six catches last week against Texas Tech. One of them came in the game-winning touchdown drive.\n\n\"Jerrod's always happy,\" senior defensive end Charles Omenihu said. \"I'm happy for him. He got the opportunity to shine. He's a good soul.\"\n\nHeard's career was supposed to be more than that. On Tuesday, he looked back at what it became and still smiled at the experience.\n\n\"I couldn't ask for a better journey,\" Heard said. \"I've enjoyed every minute of it.\"\n\nOne of the top-rated dual-threat quarterbacks in the nation coming out of high school, Heard was recruited by Mack Brown and stuck with the Longhorns after Brown was fired and Charlie Strong came in. After redshirting for a year while fans called for him to play during a 6-7 season, Strong finally gave him the keys to the offense the second game of 2015.\n\nHe won his first start against Rice, then broke Young's hallowed record which had been set in the classic 2006 Rose Bowl win over Southern California. But even that was tainted just a bit.\n\nHeard scored three times against California, his last one a 45-yard sprint through the middle of the field for what should have been the game-tying touchdown. But kicker Nick Rose missed the extra point. Heard's biggest day as a Longhorn ended as a loss.\n\nHeard had at least pumped some life into the Texas offense. Until two weeks later when Texas got smashed 50-7 at TCU. Even after an upset win over Oklahoma, Texas got shut out at Iowa State. Heard started 10 games at quarterback and Texas finished 5-7. He finished the season on the bench with concussions symptoms.\n\nHis days as a quarterback were done.\n\nBy spring 2016, Strong had revamped his offense and brought in quarterback Shane Buechele. After sitting out that spring with a shoulder injury, Heard was no longer part of the quarterback competition and moved to wide receiver.\n\nHeard probably could have transferred to play quarterback elsewhere. He wasn't that far removed from a stellar high school career that could have landed him just about anywhere.\n\nHe never considered it. Heard wanted to stay at Texas and wanted to win games. He was willing to do it from different positions.\n\n\"I couldn't be down, because I didn't know how many guys I'd bring down with me,\" Heard said. \"I really wanted for this university to win games and be a powerhouse ... I wanted to win a championship. I still think that can happen.\"\n\nHeard's first season at wide receiver was his best when he caught 24 passes and tied for the team lead with three touchdown receptions. But his role kept diminishing as the Texas offense got better. Until last Saturday, he'd caught just three passes for 29 yards this season.\n\nHe was thrust into a big role against Texas Tech because of an ankle injury to Collin Johnson, who has 50 catches for 675 yards and five touchdowns.\n\n\"He was our offensive MVP for the way that he played,\" coach Tom Herman said.\n\nHerman has made sure to keep Heard as a big presence in the locker room, putting him on the team's leadership council. No player has likely felt the highs and lows of a career like he has. The journey of his career has prepared him for challenges beyond football, Heard said.\n\n\"When life brings hardship, I feel very confident in myself (that) I can adjust to it and make it happen,\" Heard said.\n\nHeard has already earned his degree. And he's still got that record over Vince Young.\n\n\"That's a cool thing, to always have that history,\" Heard said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jim Vertuno at https://twitter.com/jimvertuno\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Senior Dexter Williams has been through countless ups and downs during his four years at Notre Dame.\n\nInjury, suspension, an arrest, the emotions of helping his ailing mother \u2014 all of it has weighed down Williams at times. He has emerged just the same as the workhorse running back for the third-ranked Fighting Irish, and a key reason Notre Dame has legitimate hopes of making the playoff.\n\nIn a 42-13 rout of Florida State last week, Williams piled up a career-high 202 yards on just 20 carries, becoming the first running back to surpass 200 rushing yards against the Seminoles since 1982. Nicknamed \"Juice\" by his teammates, he had scoring runs of 58 and 32 yards.\n\n\"I told the offensive line to give me a crease, and I would make a couple of runs for them,\" said Williams, who already this season had touchdown runs of 97 and 31 yards against Virginia Tech and 45 yards against Stanford.\n\nWith four 100-plus yard performances in six games, Williams' per-game rushing average stands at 128.3 yards, which would rank fifth in the country if he had enough games to be included among the NCAA leaders. His 6.8 yards per carry would be 13th. He leads the Irish with 770 yards and 10 touchdowns, exceeding expectations as Notre Dame (10-0) prepares for Saturday's game at Yankee Stadium in New York against No. 12 Syracuse (8-2).\n\n\"His nickname is 'Juice' for a reason,\" said Irish senior wide receiver Miles Boykin. \"His energy is contagious.\"\n\nIt took Williams more than three years \u2014 and through plenty of adversity \u2014 to get to this point.\n\nIn 2016, Williams was one of five Irish players arrested for possession of marijuana during a traffic stop. An injury cost him three straight games in 2017, and he opened this season with a four-game suspension for violating unspecified team rules.\n\n\"Me missing four games, I had a chance to really just settle down and really think about what I wanted as a person,\" said Williams, adding that the depression and guilt he felt from disappointing his teammates was almost unbearable. \"It really just took time and I just had to humble myself to continue to strive for greatness.\"\n\nReflection and maturation helped Williams find his footing, in both school and football. He is expected to graduate next month with his degree in Africana studies.\n\n\"Just growing up in his maturity, ownership and being accountable and responsible,\" coach Brian Kelly said.\n\nBut a mother's love, support and sacrifice were equally as important as anything Williams did on his own. Recognizing that her son was hurting as suspension loomed, Dexter's 60-year-old mother, Cheryl Williams, relocated to South Bend from her home near Orlando, Florida, and moved into an apartment with her son before the season.\n\nMother keeps son on track and well fed. Son watches over mom as she battles two incurable diseases \u2014 myasthenia gravis and pulmonary arterial hypertension, ailments doctors say will take her within the next few years.\n\n\"As much as I can do off the field for her, and just being able to make her happy when I'm playing the game of football, and just having her here has helped me out a lot,\" Dexter Williams said, \"and I'm pretty sure it has helped her a lot too.\"\n\nDexter Williams cherishes every day he shares with his mother, and uses his fresh outlook to lift her spirits and fuel his newfound football success.\n\n\"There is nothing like having a lot of love for your mother,\" Williams said. \"So having her here with me brightens my day.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Pekka Rinne is off to an even better start than last season when he finally won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best goalie, and backup Juuse Saros ranks among the league's top 10 for victories.\n\nWith both goalies now signed to contract extensions, the Nashville Predators may have the best goalie situation both on and off the ice.\n\n\"There's tandems that are much better than others, Nashville has one of them,\" said Martin Biron, a former NHL goalie and now Buffalo broadcaster. \"And I think if you're Peter Laviolette, if you're the goalie coach and the staff, your job and your challenge is to keep them at the highest of levels for the whole season.\"\n\nSo far, the defending Presidents' Trophy winners are doing just that.\n\nThe Predators went into Tuesday night's game in San Jose atop the league standings while also first in the NHL both in goals allowed (37) and 2.12 goals-against per game with Rinne and Saros (7-2-0) splitting the first 18 games. Rinne has been \"ImPekkable\" with a 6-1-1 record, leading all goalies with at least eight starts with a 1.47 goals-against average and .951 save percentage.\n\n\"Every day he is and continues to be the backbone of this organization and team and has probably had the biggest impact on this organization,\" Laviolette said.\n\nRinne is 3-0-1 with a .740 goals-against average and .976 save percentage and a shutout, stopping 121 of 124 shots faced since returning from injured reserve on Oct. 31. The Predators signed Rinne to a two-year extension taking him through 2020-21 on Nov. 3, and the goalie celebrated both the contract and his birthday with his second shutout of the season.\n\nBiron said Tuesday that he doesn't see a big competition for the starting job in Nashville.\n\n\"It's Pekka's job, and Nashville giving him that two-year deal I think is basically saying that 'We want Pekka, and it's going to be like that,'\" Biron said.\n\nRinne has been a Vezina finalist four of the past eight years, making the seven-year, $49 million contract he signed on an earlier birthday in 2011 worth every penny. That deal ties him for the fourth-priciest contract among goalies with Marc-Andre Fleury (33) of Vegas and Boston's Tuukka Rask (31). Fleury is under contract through 2021-22, and Rask hits free agency after the 2020-21 season.\n\nThe Predators signed Rinne to a two-year extension worth $10 million on Nov. 3. General manager David Poile also signed Saros, 23, to a three-year extension in July worth $4.5 million. That means Nashville is projected to drop from seventh with $8.5 million of its salary cap invested in goaltenders to ninth next season with a $6.5 million average annual value, according to Sportrac.com.\n\nRinne could've pushed for more money. Montreal's Carey Price, 31, is getting $10.5 million a year, while Henrik Lundqvist of the Rangers is being paid $8.5 million a year through 2020-21.\n\nBiron calls Rinne one of the hardest-working goalies he's ever seen who's in unbelievable shape. He also sees Rinne simplifying his game as he got older, like Patrick Roy, Dominik Hasek and Eddie Belfour. Rinne still can scramble and react, which Biron thinks will keep Rinne playing at a high level for possibly four more years like Lundqvist.\n\n\"Pekka can play at least through this next contract, and then after that we'll see,\" Biron said.\n\nIt's up to Nashville to make that extra cap space pay off after losing the 2017 Stanley Cup Final in six games and then in seven games in the second round last May. Poile persuaded defenseman Ryan Ellis to take a bit less money with an eight-year deal for $50 million in August, and his next task will be trying to get captain Roman Josi to agree to an extension next summer before the final year on the defenseman's current deal.\n\n\"Hopefully this helps in a way that makes this team stay together moving forward,\" Rinne said. \"I think we have an opportunity to keep this same team. And I think that's David's goal and obviously I like the sound of it. I love this group, and I really think we have a chance this year and years to come.\"\n\nEARLY RETURNS\n\nTom Wilson of the Capitals returned to the lineup Tuesday night at Minnesota after arbitrator Shyam Das reduced the forward's suspension by six games to 14 for his illegal check to the head of St. Louis forward Oskar Sundqvist at the end of the preseason.\n\nHe made an immediate impact, scoring a first-period goal in a 5-2 victory.\n\nNashville forward Austin Watson is eligible to return to the ice Thursday night when the Predators wrap up a road trip in Arizona after Das cut his suspension from 27 games to 18 after he pleaded no contest in July to a domestic assault charge.\n\nDas is the same neutral arbitrator fired by Major League Baseball in 2012 after he overturned Ryan Braun's drug suspension. The NHL fired arbitrator James Oldham in 2016 after his decision to reduce Dennis Wideman's 20-game suspension to 10 for striking and injuring an official, and either the NHL or NHLPA can fire the neutral arbitrator after each season.\n\nNWHL ALL-STAR GAME\n\nThe Predators, who hosted the 2016 NHL All-Star Game, will be hosting the 2019 NWHL All-Star Weekend capped by an NHL-NWHL doubleheader on Feb. 10. This is the third straight year the NWHL has held its All-Star Weekend in an NHL market, starting with Pittsburgh in 2017 and Minnesota in 2018.\n\nNashville will host St. Louis with a morning faceoff, and fans will be invited to stick around for the NWHL All-Star Game starting soon after the NHL matinee.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFor decades, the NFL has had a strong bond with the military. That relationship stretches far beyond the pregame and halftime ceremonies that honor veterans, and particularly ratchets up in November with the league's Salute To Service.\n\nThis year, the NFL and the Bob Woodruff Foundation have partnered to find and grant funds to organizations helping former military members. So far, 38 organizations have received grants, some in the spring and others this fall.\n\n\"One of the things we have come across are just an unbelievable amount of nonprofit organizations working to support the veteran and military community,\" says Anna Isaacson, the NFL's senior vice president of social responsibility. \"There are some reports of 40,000 such organizations.\n\n\"We hear from these organizations and we want to help every one we can, but that is sometimes difficult. The commissioner had a relationship with the Bob Woodruff Foundation and learned about the process they go through to determine which organizations should receive grants, and that there could be an awesome partnership as a grant referral pipeline. They can take our salute dollars and put them to use with the organizations doing the most impactful work in this landscape.\"\n\nThe Woodruff Foundation was founded in 2006 after reporter Woodruff was hit by a roadside bomb while covering the war in Iraq. Its $2 million affiliation with the NFL bolsters the grant work done by the foundation.\n\n\"We have now been through ... basically a whole year of granting with the NFL,\" says Dr. Margaret Harrell, the director of programs and partnerships for BWF. \"The Woodruff Foundation brings our expertise to help the NFL select the most effective and important programs that are serving the post-911 veteran population. It's a really nice partnership to ensure an increasing number of veterans benefit around the country.\n\n\"There hasn't been a huge learning curve because it's been such a delightfully smooth partnership; we have a shared interest.\"\n\nAdds Isaacson: \"This came together in our world somewhat quickly. There already are (22) organizations receiving a grant from the NFL and BWF, and some organizations we may not have partnered with have had the opportunity to engage in a partnership.\"\n\nOne of those groups is the Furniture Bank of Atlanta, a relatively small local company with a full-time staff of 11 that received a grant in October. Furniture Bank serves about 40 families a week, providing furniture to veterans and others who had been homeless and have now found a place to live. A bed for each person, plus tables, chairs, a sofa, a dresser \u2014 as many as 14 pieces, mostly used, that have been donated to the company \u2014 are supplied.\n\nBut the group takes it several steps further for those vets. It puts them to work .\n\nSome of the former military members become interns and load and unload Furniture Bank trucks. Others who show the initiative and know-how can become drivers, which allows the bank to increase its delivery schedules.\n\n\"Before we had the program, we had the idea to start an internship for someone who is homeless, help them to get a license (to drive a box truck),\" says Megan Anderson, executive director of Furniture Bank of Atlanta. \"We realized in 2014 we could expand that and the internship was a good fit with our warehouse and trucks. We had United Way seed money, and could take on 10 to 12 veterans who had to be homeless or just moving into housing.\n\n\"They work on our trucks for eight weeks, get a small stipend ... and then can go the warehouse route and get certified or get their license to drive the trucks.\"\n\nAnderson stresses that the folks they are helping are motivated to help themselves . After all, they served in the military, where motivation is a given stimulus.\n\n\"One thing we noticed, more recently out of the military members especially, is they are hard working, punctual, and have a strong appreciation for teamwork,\" she says. \"A lot of teamwork is involved here. They certainly can work as a unit. We also found multiple veterans have that camaraderie and help encourage each other.\n\n\"Maybe someone is homeless and another veteran just got an apartment, and another has a job. If someone has been homeless a while, they are pretty hopeless to some extent. Maybe they have bad luck with employment or have not been treated well, and they lose trust. It helps to see others who have succeeded.\"\n\nAnderson is certain the affiliation between the NFL and BWF has helped her group and will help others who apply for the grants. She emphasizes how easy the application process is on the NFL or BWF website, as does Harrell.\n\n\"From our perspective, the partnership between the Bob Woodruff Foundation and the NFL made applying to the foundation and getting the grant seem more accessible for a local and small organization,\" Anderson says. \"That is how we learned about this opportunity and it seemed more feasible, and it was OK that we were just working in Atlanta, which I thought was cool.\"\n\nHarrell notes that the public could get the wrong impression that all veterans are struggling when they make the transition from the military; that's far from accurate. But the work done by Furniture Bank of Atlanta is essential.\n\n\"The group Furniture Bank is serving is a group that has considerable challenges in their post-military lives,\" she explains. \"The organization gives these individuals the benefit of the doubt and works with them on an individual basis, provides them with credentials for the future, and keeps them on board long enough for Furniture Bank to vouch for them as an employee.\"\n\nShe offers a reminder to those groups that have applied but not received NFL/BWF grants that they won't be forgotten. Of the roughly 200 that BWF expects will submit a proposal, the foundation requests a further proposal from around 30 to 40 submissions, although it will engage in feedback with all 200.\n\n\"There is no set number of grants or a set grant amount,\" she says. \"It depends on the need and scope of the program and the level we can handle. Of the 200 proposals we receive, we probably wind up granting to only a small portion, but we re-engage with them to explain where their proposal did not meet what we were seeking.\n\n\"I am very confident, given our expertise from the foundation, that the money goes to the best organizations and we are excited to see especially local small programs that we were not familiar with being recognized.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 On a night when he reached an impressive personal milestone, Joe Thornton wasn't taking stock of his career accomplishments.\n\nThe veteran San Jose Sharks center even bristled when asked about it.\n\n\"I'm just trying to improve my game, to be honest with you,\" he said.\n\nAll that hard work is still paying off.\n\nThornton broke a third-period tie with his 400th goal, Joe Pavelski scored twice and the Sharks defeated the Nashville Predators 5-4 on Tuesday after squandering a three-goal lead.\n\nMarcus Sorensen and Antti Suomela also scored to help San Jose win its second straight and fourth in six games. Sorensen had two assists to give him six points (two goals, four assists) over his last three games.\n\nThe 39-year-old Thornton is anchoring a third line that includes Sorensen (26) and Kevin Labanc (22).\n\n\"I don't care who I play with, I just want to play and enjoy it and have fun. That's what you saw tonight,\" Thornton said. \"That was the purest form of hockey you can have. It was just a bunch of kids playing hockey. Our backs were against the wall, but we came back. It was just a great hockey game.\"\n\nFilip Forsberg had two goals and an assist for the Predators, who dropped to 8-1-1 on the road. They lead the NHL with 27 points.\n\nCraig Smith added a goal and an assist for Nashville, which scored four straight times after trailing 3-0. Rocco Grimaldi's breakaway goal at 2:43 of the third gave the Predators a 4-3 lead.\n\n\"It was a bad start. That's the only way to describe it,\" Smith said. \"We gave them everything they got. In the second period we did to them what they did to us. It's unacceptable how we started. I'd rather not start 0-3.\"\n\nPavelski tied it with his second goal, 13 seconds before Thornton put the Sharks ahead 5-4 at 13:18 of the third.\n\n\"It was an interesting game,\" San Jose coach Pete DeBoer said. \"I'm sure I've been a part of a game like that, but I don't remember it and probably don't care to remember it. The good thing is we came out on the right side.\"\n\nNashville had a six-game point streak snapped.\n\n\"The first period, there's nothing that can be said. It was abysmal,\" Grimaldi said. \"The first period is not acceptable for a team of our caliber against a middle-of-the-pack team. The first period came back to bite us. No matter what happens we believe we can come back.\"\n\nNOTES: Predators C Calle Jarnkrok (lower body) didn't play and is day to day. Grimaldi took his spot in the lineup. ...

(Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe good news is the leftovers. When committee members leave the Bluebonnet Boardroom, they routinely make a beeline to the buffet table, where a breakfast item has been left out at their request.\n\nClemson athletic director Dan Radakovich, who served on the College Football Playoff selection committee from 2014-17, recalls \u201cthe best bacon any of us had ever had \u2013 so we\u2019d nibble on it while we were outside.\u201d And understand, Radakovich was outside a lot. Whenever Clemson was discussed \u2013 and given the Tigers\u2019 performances these last few years, this happened often \u2013 Radakovich was asked to leave the boardroom because of the playoff\u2019s recusal policy.\n\nHe would get some work done for his day job. If necessary, he\u2019d do some last-minute homework on the remaining teams to be discussed and ranked. And yeah, he\u2019d wonder what was being said inside the room.\n\n\u201cThe bacon tray was always remaining,\u201d Radakovich says, \u201cso that was a positive.\u201d\n\nWe bring this up because even on a week when the top 10 did not change at all \u2013 we know, they bring a clean sheet of paper and rank teams as though the season was over and they had not ranked them a week earlier \u2013 there was likely plenty of discussion of teams\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. And that meant for at least part of the meeting, two committee members had to leave the room.\n\nWhen the committee discussed Oklahoma, or voted on the group of teams Oklahoma was bunched with, Joe Castiglione was banished to that very nice holding room. That's as it should be; as Oklahoma\u2019s athletic director, he\u2019s recused from anything related to his school. But Frank Beamer, the retired Virginia Tech coach whose son Shane Beamer is an Oklahoma assistant coach, joined him.\n\nPresumably they ate bacon and traded small talk. What they did not do was participate in anything regarding Oklahoma \u2013 creating a situation in which discussions and debates involving the team currently ranked No. 6 is conducted with only 11 of 13 committee members.\n\nHow does that impact the way the rankings sausage gets made?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had two or more recusals in the past, and it just hasn\u2019t been an issue at all,\u201d says Bill Hancock, the College Football Playoff\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe still have plenty of really good football people in the room.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right about both. In 2015 and 2016, both Condoleezza Rice and Tyrone Willingham were recused from discussions and votes involving Stanford. And it was not ultimately an issue, at least not as it relates to the four-team bracket.\n\nThe Cardinal finished No. 6 in the final rankings in 2015, but with two losses was not a significant part of the debate for the No. 4 slot (Stanford finished 18th and was not part of the conversation in 2016).\n\nOklahoma ranks No. 6 for the second consecutive week, but will factor into a discussion over the No. 4 slot if it continues to win. There has been much debate nationally about the Sooners\u2019 defensive struggles \u2013 Is this team, even with perhaps the nation\u2019s most explosive offense, fit for the playoff with that defense? \u2013 and you\u2019d better believe that same conversation is being had by the people who\u2019ll actually make that decision in less than three weeks.\n\n\u201cWe talk about Oklahoma in total,\u201d says selection committee chairman Rob Mullens, the Oregon athletic director. \u201cSo we look at their whole resume, and you start off by saying they\u2019re 9-1, and their only loss is to a Texas team at a neutral site in a very close game. But as you dig deeper, you see a great quarterback, one of the top offenses in the country with a lot of playmakers, but you also notice particularly in the last two weeks that the defense has struggled and that their offense is carrying them. That\u2019s all part of the discussion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s what you figured Mullens would say, because the goal is not to say much. But clearly, Oklahoma\u2019s defense is and should be a very big part of the discussion. And it might very well be the factor that prevents the Sooners, even if they win out, from getting into the bracket.\n\nIt might also be exactly the right call.\n\nBut it\u2019s unfortunate the discussion and vote is being conducted with only 11 of 13 members.\n\nThe recusal policy is a very good thing; it eliminates concern about the integrity of the process. Selection committee members literally check their hats at the door to the boardroom before each meeting, signifying their intent to shed allegiances.\n\nBut Castiglione should not be allowed to discuss or rank his school. Neither should Gene Smith, Ohio State\u2019s athletic director, discuss or rank the Buckeyes. (The other recusals for the 2018 season: Paola Boivin, Arizona State; Herb Deromedi, Central Michigan; Scott Stricklin, Florida; Todd Stansbury, Georgia Tech; Mullens, Oregon; Jeff Bower, Southern Mississippi. All are allowed to answer \u201cfactual questions\u201d about those schools, but can\u2019t be present during discussions or votes.)\n\nIt certainly might be better for Oklahoma if the Big 12\u2019s representative athletic director on the selection committee was from, say, Baylor or Iowa State or even Texas (Castiglione replaced Texas Tech\u2019s Kirby Hocutt) \u2013 but them\u2019s the breaks, and it\u2019s too bad for Oklahoma.\n\nBut losing Beamer\u2019s voice, as well, could change things in incalculable ways. Beamer is recused from Virginia Tech, of course. Last year, he was also recused from Georgia, where his son was an assistant. But when Shane became an assistant at Oklahoma during the offseason, his father was recused from Oklahoma (and he can now discuss Georgia all he wants).\n\nWho knows how that alters the discussion? It\u2019s possible Beamer, as an old-school coach, would say, \u201cthat defense is terrible,\u201d and indicate that there\u2019s no way the Sooners should be in the mix. But there\u2019s no real way to know. On a committee of 13, a strong missing voice could be significant; two votes not being cast one way or another even moreso.\n\nAs you might imagine, Hancock says it\u2019s not a problem. But it\u2019s an interesting thing to ponder as we consider the possible turmoil in a few weeks over which teams should make the final bracket.\n\nMullens declined Tuesday to estimate how much time the committee spent this week discussing Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I could put a stopwatch on the amount of time we spent,\u201d Mullens says, \u201cbut I can tell you it\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Radakovich says he\u2019s not sure how long his temporary exiles lasted \u2013 though as it got later in the season, nearer to the final set of rankings, they lengthened. He\u2019d be out of the boardroom for a half-hour, and sometimes longer.\n\n\u201cYou know that you have many, many good reasons for the people that are directly related to an organization not to be in the room,\u201d Radakovich says. \u201cI absolutely understand that. But you do a lot of the same work as everyone else. There were times, because of (Clemson\u2019s) success \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world \u2013 that I felt like I missed some of the more interesting discussions. \u2026 I was very happy to be out of the room because it meant (Clemson was) involved at a high level.\u201d\n\nBut those extended absences from the discussion and debate led inevitably to one other concerning issue.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any bacon left,\u201d Radakovich says. \u201cIf I was out that long, I\u2019d eat all the bacon.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Gene editing promises to boost nutrition in foods", "description": "By early next year, the first foods made from gene-edited plants are expected to begin selling.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Toronto Maple Leafs have one of the fastest teams in hockey. The Los Angeles Kings do not.\n\nAnd when the Leafs hit the Staples Center ice in full flight, the Kings were caught a bit flat-footed.\n\nNazem Kadri scored two power-play goals and John Tavares had a goal and two assists in the Maple Leafs' 5-1 victory Tuesday night.\n\nMorgan Rielly and Andreas Johnsson also scored in the Leafs' fourth win in five games overall and their seventh win in eight road games this season. Frederik Andersen made 22 saves as Toronto's burgeoning powerhouse swept its two-game season series with NHL-worst Los Angeles by a combined 9-2.\n\n\"We were moving our feet from the start,\" said Toronto's Mitch Marner, who had two assists despite needing a few stitches after Alex Iafallo's stick hit him in the mouth in the second period. \"We drew penalties with our speed. That's something we haven't done (much) this year. Our whole team came out ready to play, and we made it hard on their (defense).\"\n\nToronto opened a three-game California road swing with another dominant performance, leading 2-0 just 6:12 in and getting 11 shots on net before Los Angeles got its first. The Maple Leafs scored three power-play goals and continued their impressive start to the season despite the continued absence of holdout William Nylander and star Auston Matthews, who missed his seventh straight game with a shoulder injury.\n\nKadri said the Leafs dominated \"by being fast. I think that's the identity of our team, and we wanted to use it to our advantage.\"\n\nTavares scored a goal in his third consecutive game, connecting on the power play in the first period for his 11th goal of the season. The star forward already has 22 points in 18 games during his debut season with his hometown team.\n\n\"(Tavares) has been great,\" said Rielly, who leads all NHL defensemen with 23 points after getting a goal and an assist. \"We're 18 games in, and he's been outstanding. He's been a leader. He's been a 200-foot player. He's been putting the puck in the net.\"\n\nAdrian Kempe scored for the Kings, who have lost three straight while scoring just two combined goals since winning their debut under interim coach Willie Desjardins last week. The NHL's lowest-scoring team went 3-4-0 on a seven-game homestand.\n\n\"We've got to pull our stuff together here quickly and win some games,\" Los Angeles captain Anze Kopitar said. \"We've been talking for a while now. If we don't get our minds to it and actually get it done on the ice, it doesn't mean anything.\"\n\nJohnsson's goal early in the second period put Toronto up 4-1 and chased Peter Budaj, who stopped 15 shots. He was replaced by Cal Petersen, who stopped 15 shots in his NHL debut.\n\nThe Kings are down to their top two AHL goalies after Jack Campbell joined Jonathan Quick on injured reserve this week with torn meniscuses in their knees.\n\n\"I was a little surprised\" to get put in the game, Petersen said. \"I didn't hear the coach right away. It was an exciting moment, and I got to face a shot right away, which helped. I was just trying not to make it bigger than it is.\"\n\nBut even LA's normally sturdy penalty-killing units struggled against Toronto, giving up multiple power-play goals for only the second time this season.\n\nKempe ended his 12-game goalless streak with a first-period deflection, but Rielly put Toronto up 3-1 early in the second after two Leafs converged on Kings defenseman Drew Doughty and forced a turnover.\n\nJohnsson then scored after four Kings stood and watched while Travis Dermott skated the puck from the point to the net for a pass.\n\nKadri connected again late in the second period for his fourth goal in four games and his seventh in nine games.\n\nNOTES: Dermott scored his first point since Toronto's season opener. ... Kings D Dion Phaneuf took the shot that Kempe deflected for a goal, allowing the former Toronto defenseman to score his first point in 17 games this season. ... Kempe scored just his second goal in his last 50 games. ... The 24-year-old Petersen, who once started 90 consecutive games for Notre Dame, is the 71st goalie in Kings franchise history and the 13th to make his first appearance for the club in relief.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMaple Leafs: At San Jose on Thursday.\n\nKings: At Chicago on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Kevin Durant never found his typical offensive flow and found it a little strange playing without fiery Draymond Green, even if they have yet to make up from all that went down a night earlier in Los Angeles.\n\nDurant isn't sharing any details.\n\n\"I'm going to keep that in house, that's what we do here,\" Durant said. \"I'm not trying to give nobody no headlines.

The two-time MVP shuffled and danced as he celebrated big plays from the bench.\n\nTaurean Prince scored 22 points, making four 3-pointers and finishing 8 for 14 from the floor in the Hawks' fifth straight loss and ninth in 10.\n\nDurant led the way despite shooting 9 of 23 hours after the Warriors suspended All-Star Green for one game without pay for conduct detrimental to the team. He got into it with Durant on the bench at the end of regulation in a 121-116 overtime road loss to the Clippers and Green wasn't even at the arena Tuesday.\n\nJonas Jerebko started in place of Green and had season bests of 14 points and 14 rebounds \u2014 \"He was our MVP tonight,\" coach Steve Kerr said \u2014 as the Warriors stayed unbeaten in the second game of a back-to-back this season.\n\nQuinn Cook dished out six of Golden State's 28 assists playing in Curry's spot.\n\n\"I think we're all professional. We all love each other. We're with each other every day for nine months. Brothers are going to fight and brothers are going to get into it,\" Cook said. \"I think the biggest thing, we know the common goal, we know what's at stake. These guys have been great for a while. I think we're all going to get past this and come together. It's going to make us stronger.\"\n\nDoes Durant agree?\n\n\"Who knows, we'll see,\" he said.\n\nDazzling Atlanta rookie Trae Young was held to four points on 2-for-12 shooting and missed all five of his attempts from beyond the arc. The Hawks dropped their eighth straight to the Warriors and seventh in a row at Oracle Arena.\n\nGolden State shot 6 for 21 in the opening quarter, missing 7 of 9 3-point tries.\n\n\"Not an easy game back-to-back, just coming in a little fatigued, a little emotionally spent and we had to grind it out,\" Kerr said. \"I'm proud of the guys. It wasn't our best game but it was a good effort. We stayed solid.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHawks: Atlanta hasn't won on Golden State's home floor since a 95-79 victory on Feb. 25, 2011, and not in the series since Feb. 6, 2015. ... The Hawks are 1-7 on the road, 0-3 vs. the Western Conference. .. Prince has hit at least one 3 in his first 13 games. \"Just to see him in rhythm, in our offense with the ball and body movement that we like to play with, really helped everybody out,\" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said.\n\nWarriors: Durant made all 11 of his free throws and grabbed six rebounds. ... Jerebko posted his 11th career double-double. ... Golden State is 40-60 all-time without Curry, 23-19 since 2014-15. ... The Warriors are 3-0 in the second game playing consecutive nights. ... Golden State sold out for the 300th consecutive game, the fourth-longest active streak in the NBA.\n\nSMALL RING CEREMONY\n\nBehind the scenes, a few more Warriors championship rings were delivered.\n\nFormer athletic trainer Chelsea Lane returned to Oracle with Atlanta and so did ex-Warriors performance coach and therapist Michael Irr and former assistant athletic trainer John Dusel.\n\nLane, who was key to getting Curry back on the court for the playoffs, left the organization after the latest championship run to become Atlanta's executive director of athletic performance and sports medicine.\n\nWarriors general manager and assistant GM Kirk Lacob presented the rings outside Atlanta's locker room during pregame warmups.\n\nLane joked about texting a photo of her ring to departed center Zaza Pachulia, who won't return to Oracle until late March with his new Pistons team to get his sparkling jewelry.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHawks: At Denver on Thursday night.\n\nWarriors: At Houston on Thursday to begin a three-game road trip all in Texas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I'm happy tonight that I was able to come through.\"\n\nAustin had 20 points and six assists, Justice Sueing added 17 points and seven rebounds and Darius McNeill scored 11 for California.\n\nThe Golden Bears (1-1) led by 17 at halftime then had to hold off a late surge by the Pirates to win their home opener after losing to Yale in China last week.\n\nIn that loss Cal shot a paltry 35.3 percent and had no rhythm to its offense.\n\n\"We were really excited so we just came out jacking up shots,\" Austin said. \"Today our emphasis was great shots instead of good shots. We just continued to move the ball and do it at a face pace, and thing opened up for us.\"\n\nAfter Kalin Fisher and Akim Mitchell scored on consecutive layups to cut Cal's lead to 61-55 with 9:14 remaining, Kelly scored on a three-point play. Austin added two free throws and Kelly made a layup as part of 9-0 run.\n\n\"They made their run and I was happy to see that we fought through it,\" Jones said. \"The zone saved us in that because (Jermaine) Marrow was getting into the lane. That was a key. At the end of the day we're still a young team but we're continuing to grow. Tonight you saw them really look like a team.\n\nMarrow scored 26 points for Hampton. The Pirates (1-2) are in their first season in the Big South.\n\nWEAVING IT UP\n\nThe Bears repeatedly used the weave as part of their offense and Jones hinted it's likely to be a staple of Cal's offense.\n\n\"With teams that switch you want to get the mismatch,\" Jones said. \"With teams that don't switch you want to run some clock. The weave was good for us tonight and something that we'll continue to use.\"\n\nETC.\n\nAll five Cal starters scored in double figures. . Hampton outrebound Cal 44-37. . The Bears had 15 assists after tallying six against Yale. . Cal shot 57.1 percent (8 of 14) on 3-pointers, higher than any game it had all of last year.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nHampton: Give the Pirates credit for hanging around long enough to make a run in the second half but they couldn't get over the hump in the final four minutes. Marrow looks ready to follow up on his spectacular 2017 season, although he was called for a technical foul in the second half.\n\nCalifornia: It definitely wasn't pretty but for a team that had only eight wins last season, the Bears will take what they can get. Kelly looks to be formidable in the middle and might be Cal's most versatile center in some time. It also says something that the Bears won despite being beaten on the boards.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHampton: The Pirates return home to face Bowling Green on Monday. Hampton has won 13 of its last 16 home games.\n\nCalifornia: Hosts Detroit Mercy and first-year coach Mike Davis on Thursday in the second round of the Legends Classic before heading to Brooklyn next week for the final two games of the tournament. Davis has 352 career wins at Indiana, Alabama-Birmingham and Texas Southern.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Eric Gay/Associated Press)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2013 The Texas Board of Education preliminarily voted Tuesday night to restore Hillary Clinton and Helen Keller to the state\u2019s history curriculum and to slightly soften language about the Arab-Israeli conflict \u2013 surprising moments of bipartisanship for members who have long waged ideological battles about how students in the nation\u2019s second largest state learn history.\n\nThe moves came after the board\u2019s 10 Republicans and five Democrats heard hours of often impassioned testimony from students, teachers, activists and university experts on proposed edits meant to streamline academic standards for history. A final vote is scheduled for Friday and more changes can still be made.\n\nIn September, the board voted to cut lessons on former secretary of state, senator and 2016 presidential candidate Clinton, as well as Keller, an iconic activist who was deaf and blind.\n\nEmotions often ran high Tuesday, particularly when Gabrielle Caldwell, a 17-year-old hearing- and visually-impaired student, spoke about how Keller was the only connection many people have to the deaf and blind community.\n\n\u201cI am hoping you keep Helen Keller being taught in our schools,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cShe\u2019s a hero.\u201d\n\nThe board voted hours after Caldwell\u2019s testimony to restore Keller to third grade curriculums with minimal debate. It also restored a previously trimmed second grade lesson about Women Airforce Service Pilots, civilians who flew during World War II and were the first U.S. women to pilot military aircraft.\n\nThe proposal to again include Clinton sparked more debate but eventually passed easily. Democrats said Texas girls will be inspired by \u2013 and should be taught about \u2013 the first female presidential candidate to earn a major party nomination, while Republicans said they\u2019d heard from other residents demanding to know why Clinton was cut in the first place.\n\n\u201cI think she qualifies as a significant political leader,\u201d said Marty Rowley, a Republican from Amarillo, while noting that he didn\u2019t agree with Clinton\u2019s politics.\n\nTexas has around 5.4 million public school students, more than any state but California. Teaching board-approved lessons isn\u2019t always mandatory, but its sanctioned curriculum can affect what\u2019s published in textbooks.\n\nOther hot-button curriculum topics went unchanged despite long-standing objections from university professors and other experts. The board refused to modify controversial lessons on the causes of the Civil War and asking students to explore the biblical figure Moses\u2019 influence on the nation\u2019s Founding Fathers.\n\nPolitical lessons referencing Moses have been in Texas curriculums since 2010. A panel of experts had proposed cutting those, but the board voted in September to preserve them. It also retained language that students learn how \u201cArab rejection of the State of Israel has led to ongoing conflict\u201d in the Middle East.\n\nOn Tuesday, the board voted to make rejection of many Arabs of the State of Israel a contributing factor to Middle East conflict. But it didn\u2019t change references to Moses, or instruction on how sectionalism and states\u2019 rights were \u201ccontributing factors\u201d to the Civil War, while also noting in the curriculum that slavery was a \u201ccentral cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people who believe that some of the events that happened long before this became a boiling point for war was the fact that they did not want to be told what to do by the central government,\u201d Pat Hardy, a Republican from Fort Worth, said of the Civil War, adding that southern states were \u201cvery, very independent\u201d and didn\u2019t like Washington telling them what to do.\n\nRuben Cortez, a Democrat from the Texas-Mexico border city of Brownsville, responded: \u201cI think we just need to do the right thing, and I think I better stop talking before I get upset.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/13/hillary-clinton-helen-keller-lessons-restored-texas-study/1996899002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Howard dominates Regent in 108-51 win behind Cole's 20 pts", "description": "RJ Cole scored 20 points with seven assists and six rebounds and Howard beat NCCAA-member Regent 108-51", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/14/howard-dominates-regent-in-108-51-win-behind-coles-20-pts/38523759/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T05:03:13Z", "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C.

Our bigs did a great job of finding those passing pockets. It requires patience, especially as a playmaker.\n\n\"It's going to take time, but we're getting there. If we keep guarding and defending at a high level our offense will come around. Once we put both together, it's going to get scary.\"\n\nChris Paul added 21 points for Houston, playing a third straight game without Carmelo Anthony because of what the team said was an illness.\n\nHouston, which had an NBA-high 65 wins last season, has won five of seven games since a 1-5 start.\n\n\"It's starting to roll a little bit better,\" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said.\n\nMonte Morris had 19 points for the Nuggets, who have lost their last eight meetings with Houston. Gary Harris and Jamal Murray added 15 points apiece.\n\nA step-back shot by Murray got Denver within four points midway through the fourth quarter but Harden went on a tear, scoring 11 straight Houston points to put the Rockets up 104-91 with 3:48 remaining.\n\nMurray said trying to slow down Harden is tough, not only because of his skill level as a former league MVP but because of the because of the players surrounding him.\n\n\"They've got shooters all around,\" Murray said. \"They've got a great team. He's surrounded by players you have to guard as well, not just James Harden, so it gives him a lot of space to operate in and he did that tonight.\"\n\nThe Nuggets closed the gap to six points in the waning moments but the Rockets got a couple of free throws from Paul and a dunk from Capela to hold on.\n\n\"We got two really good wins (consecutively),\" Paul said. \"This was a good road win for us. They play well here at home. We'll take it. We're still just building.\"\n\nDown by a point at the break, the Rockets opened up an 86-76 lead going into the final quarter. After a pair of free throws by Paul Millsap pulled Denver to 74-72, the Rockets closed the final 4 1/2 minutes of the third period on a 12-4 run capped by Eric Gordon's driving layup.\n\nMurray hit a jumper in the final seconds of the second quarter to give the Nuggets a 55-54 halftime lead.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nRockets: G/F Gerald Green missed a second game due to a right ankle sprain, but is nearing a return.

(AP) \u2014 No. 5 Tennessee celebrated its first top-five ranking in more than a decade by showcasing the stingy defense that helped these Volunteers earn their rare status.\n\nGrant Williams scored 22 points as Tennessee beat cold-shooting Georgia Tech 66-53 on Tuesday night, one day after the Vols (3-0) moved up a spot in the Top 25 to reach the top five for the first time since the 2007-08 season.\n\nGeorgia Tech (1-1) shot just 27.6 percent from the field \u2014 its lowest mark since Josh Pastner took over as coach in 2016. The Yellow Jackets had nearly twice as many fouls (30) as baskets (16).\n\n\"You've got to hang your hat on something, and for the last few years we've tried to hang our hat on our defense,\" Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said. \"We really have.\"\n\nTennessee is doing a better job than ever in that regard. Through their first three games of the season, the Volunteers have allowed opponents to shoot just 29.3 percent from the floor.\n\nAfter Georgia Tech made the game's first basket, Tennessee scored the next seven points and stayed in control the rest of the way.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets missed 15 straight shots during one stretch, including their first 11 attempts of the second half. They didn't make their first second-half basket until Jose Alvarado sank a 3-pointer with 12:12 left.\n\n\"Tennessee's a great team,\" Pastner said. \"They've got a realistic chance of being in the Final Four and obviously winning the SEC. We've got to get better, and we will continue to get better. I really like this young squad that we've got.\"\n\nGeorgia Tech managed to hang around and cut Tennessee's lead to 45-37 on another basket by Alvarado with 10:08 remaining, but the Volunteers responded with seven straight points.\n\nJordan Bone had 15 points and Kyle Alexander added 12 for Tennessee. Brandon Alston led Georgia Tech with 16.\n\nTennessee's defense enabled the Vols to win on a night when they shot just 39.6 percent (19 of 48) from the field and 63.2 percent (24 of 38) at the foul line.\n\n\"It was great to have a competitive game where we truly had to play the entire 40 minutes,\" Williams said. \"We were really sloppy. We stopped ourselves at times, so we need to do a better job with that.\"\n\nTennessee played a third straight game without guard Lamonte' Turner, who has a shoulder injury. Turner averaged 10.9 points and was the SEC's co-sixth man of the year last season.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nGeorgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets lacked the outside shooting that helped them beat Lamar 88-69 in their season opener. Georgia Tech went just 3 of 19 from beyond the arc. Georgia Tech's 12 3-point baskets and 30 3-point attempts against Lamar were the most by the Yellow Jackets under Pastner.\n\nTennessee: After winning its first two games by an average margin of 33.5 points, Tennessee passed a tougher test before heading to the NIT Season Tip-Off next week in Brooklyn, New York. After facing Louisville in the first round, Tennessee will meet No. 2 Kansas or No. 24 Marquette.\n\nBANKS' DEBUT\n\nGeorgia Tech received some good news earlier in the day as the NCAA granted a waiver allowing Texas transfer James Banks III to play immediately for the Yellow Jackets rather than sitting out the season. The 6-foot-10 forward had five points and seven rebounds in 16 minutes before fouling out.\n\n\"He gives us something where we can play big in some different lineups,\" Pastner said. \"There's times because of the way we're playing that we're going to be in foul trouble. Our two games, we've been in foul trouble. So it's good to have that extra depth.\"\n\nPHILLIPS' RETURN\n\nThe game marked a return to Knoxville for Georgia Tech guard Shembari Phillips, who played two seasons at Tennessee before transferring. Phillips started and played 22 minutes but scored just two points.\n\nNOTABLE NUMBERS\n\nThe teams combined for 49 fouls and 59 free throws. ... Alexander, a senior, made just the third 3-pointer of his career in his 71st start. ... Tennessee guard Jordan Bowden made one basket and scored only five points but had a career-high 11 rebounds.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGeorgia Tech hosts East Carolina on Friday.\n\nTennessee faces Louisville on Nov. 21 in the NIT Season Tip-Off in Brooklyn.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Many in both Koreas still harbor strong resentment against the Japanese colonial masters. But in South Korea, it's extremely rare for anyone to publicly celebrate or mock the atomic bombings.\n\nBTS' agency said the A-bomb shirt's wearing was \"in no way intentional\" and that it wasn't designed to \"injure or make light of those affected by the use of atomic weapons.\" It said it still apologizes for \"failing to take the precautions that could have prevented the wearing of such clothing by our artist.\"\n\nRegarding the hat furor, it said all apparel and accessories used for the photo book were provided by a media company involved in its publication. It said the flags in question were aimed at symbolizing South Korea's restrictively uniform and authoritarian educational systems, not Nazism.\n\n\"We will carefully examine and review not only these issues but all activities involving Big Hit and our artists based on a firm understanding of diverse social, historical and cultural considerations to ensure that we never cause any injury, pain or distress to anyone,\" the agency statement said.\n\nThe seven-member band, which has worldwide following, was the first South Korean artists in May to top the Billboard 200 albums chart with \"Love Yourself: Tear.\" The band began its Japan tour earlier this week.\n\nSouth Korean K-pop and movie stars are extremely popular in Japan and other Asian countries.\n\nCLOSE BTS member RM says \"it's great that people start discussions\" about meetings between North and South Korea leaders.

(Photo: Rodrigo Abd, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A California National Guard soldier has been charged with human trafficking after he was arrested near San Diego over the weekend, as the Pentagon's military buildup at the Southwest border continues.\n\nEdward Jair Acosta-Avila was charged in federal court with attempting to smuggle three Mexican men into the United States, according to court documents. Acosta-Avila is a private in the California Army National Guard, according to Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas Keegan, a spokesman there.\n\nAcosta-Villa was pending discharge for being absent without leave (AWOL) at the time of his arrest, Keegan said.\n\nNews of the arrest of an American soldier for human trafficking comes on the eve of the visit of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to the southwest border. President Donald Trump has ordered as many as 7,000 active-duty U.S. troops to California, Arizona and Texas as a show of force against caravans of migrants from Central America.\n\nMattis is expected to visit with the troops and observe their operations. Critics, including former President Barack Obama, have called the deployment of active-duty troop a political stunt. Mattis has rejected that characterization.\n\nThe first group of migrants arrived Tuesday. Trump repeatedly railed against the migrants in the run up to last week's midterm election in which Democrats seized control of the House. Trump has said little about them since.\n\nSo far, about 5,000 active-duty troops have been deployed to the border, joining about 2,100 National Guard soldiers who have been assisting Border Patrol agents. They have been stringing concertina wire at ports of entry into the United States and providing other logistical support.\n\nThe soldiers were supposed to help agents prevent migrants from entering the United States illegally. Instead, Private First Class Acosta-Avila hoped to profit from smuggling them past authorities, according to court documents. Acosta-Avila had not been assigned to border duty, Keegan said.\n\nOn Saturday, a Border Patrol agent stopped a Honda Accord driven by Acosta-Avila about two miles north of the border, according to a criminal complaint. Three men in the back seat tried to hide beneath a blanket.\n\nAcosta-Avila told authorities that another man had asked him to drive to the area near the border to pick up some people near the border. Acosta-Avila's friend and co-defendant told authorities that he planned to split $400 with him for sneaking the three Mexican men into the United States.\n\nThe Mexican men told authorities that they \"made smuggling arrangements and agreed to pay between $6,000 and $7,000 each to smuggled into the United States.\"\n\nAcosta-Avila was charged with transportation of certain aliens for financial gain. His attorney could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/13/awol-national-guard-solider-charged-human-trafficking-border/1996285002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Reviewed.com, TJ Donegan, Reviewed.com", "title": "The best Black Friday TV deals of 2018: Samsung, LG, Roku and more", "description": "Shopping for a new TV?

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\n\n\nBlack Friday 2018 is almost here, and the deals are in full swing. At Reviewed, our shopping and TV experts are tracking prices all month long to bring you the best Black Friday deals. The great news? When it comes to TVs, most of the best deals are live right now. Unless you want a mediocre doorbuster, there's no reason to wait.\n\n\n\nThe Best Black Friday 2018 TV deals available now:\n\n1. LG C8 OLED 4K TV\u2014$1,696.99 on Amazon (Save $500): This is the best TV of the year. It usually goes for $2,200, but has been dropping little by little since September, and right now it's at its lowest price we've seen at major retailers (and it's available with Prime shipping). The 65-inch is $300 off right now too, marking its lowest Amazon price of the season. Update: this TV is down to just $1,349.99 at BJ's if you're a member and select in-store pickup\u2014easily the best TV deal we've seen all year.\n\n2. TCL 43-In. Roku 4K Smart TV (2018)\u2014$279.99 on Amazon (Save $50): This TCL 4K TV is a bit cheaper than the nicer S5 model, which is on sale for $320 (down from $350). The main reason this one's $40 less? Unlike the S5, the S4 doesn't have Dolby Vision and the Roku remote doesn't have a headphone jack for wireless audio, but you can't beat the picture quality for the price. Update: the 43-inch is currently unavailable, but other sizes are still on sale.\n\n3. Samsung NU8000 55-In. 8-Series Smart 4K TV\u2014$747.99 on Amazon (Save $150): We were impressed by this TV in our tests, but our main hangup was the high starting price. This deal sorts that out, netting you a very good all-around name-brand TV for an affordable price. You can also get a 65-inch model on sale for $997.99 ($300 off), making it one of the cheaper 65-inch 2018 TVs in this class.\n\n4. TCL 55-In. Roku 4K Smart TV (2017)\u2014$349.99 on Amazon (Save $30): With 4K and Roku's streaming platform built in, you really can't find a better deal on an entry-level big screen TV. At this low sale price, we love this 4K TV, especially for secondary viewing areas like bedrooms, kitchens, or playrooms. It usually costs $380, and originally retailed for $450, so it's a great buy on one of last year's best budget TVs.\n\n5. TCL 65-in. Roku 4K Smart TV (2018 6 Series)\u2014$899.99 at Best Buy (Save $70): This is the Best Buy exclusive version of one of our favorite TVs this year, offering awesome picture quality, the Roku smart platform, and pristine HDR in a 65-inch package. The non-Best Buy version goes for $999 regularly, so you're basically saving $100 off the competition here.\n\n6. Samsung 50-in. 6-Series 4K TV (2018)\u2014$327.99 (Save $272): It's not often you can get a 50-inch 4K Samsung TV for under $350, but here we are. This is one of the lower-end 4K TVs Samsung offers, but if you prefer Samsung over budget-conscious brands like Vizio and TCL, this is a great deal.\n\n\n\nHere are some other TV and home theater deals worth checking out, though not nearly as good as the ones above. Most of these are also live now, but some (especially the Roku Ultra, our favorite streaming box) won't go live until Black Friday:\n\n\n\nOver the next week and on Black Friday proper there are a few other deals that may be worth checking out, but most of the Black Friday ads from stores like Wal-mart and Best Buy feature deals that are already live above.\n\nWe'll update this post as soon as we find any more deals worth highlighting throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but if you want a deal on a TV, we think you're better off just buying one of the above now.\n\n\n\nReviewed.com has you covered through the shopping madness, researching endlessly to find you the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals.

Oshie in the first period of an NHL hockey game Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, in St. Paul, Minn. (AP Photo/Jim Mone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 The Washington Capitals woke up in Minnesota for the start of a four-game road trip with a pleasant surprise: Tom Wilson was back.\n\nSo was the vigor for the Stanley Cup champions, who've started their title-defense season rather slowly.\n\nWilson returned early from his player-safety suspension and scored a first-period goal, helping the Capitals cool off the Wild with a 5-2 victory on Tuesday night.\n\n\"He's a key player for our team. Brings so much energy both on the ice and off the ice, so a huge lift for the team to get him back,\" said Andre Burakovsky, who had a goal and an assist.\n\nDmitry Orlov had his first two goals of the season and an assist, T.J. Oshie also scored and backup goalie Pheonix Copley made 26 saves for the Capitals, who welcomed Wilson back to the right wing on the first line with captain Alex Ovechkin and center Evgeny Kuznetsov. An arbitrator's reduction of Wilson's 20-game ban for an illegal blindside hit to the head in a preseason game made him immediately eligible again.\n\n\"It was a good game by the fellas, and it felt good to put together a good 60 minutes,\" Wilson said. \"Hopefully we can get this thing going a little.\"\n\nMikko Koivu and Matt Dumba had goals for the Wild, who played at home for the first time in 17 days after a 5-2 finish on their franchise-record seven-game road swing. They fell to 5-1-2 at Xcel Energy Center, becoming the last team in the NHL to lose at home in regulation this season.\n\n\"You get spoiled. They weren't as good as they were for the last 12 games,\" said coach Bruce Boudreau, whose club was 10-2 over the previous four weeks.\n\nThe Wild have given up the first goal in 13 of their 18 games, though they entered the night tied for the best record in the league in those situations at 8-3-1. Orlov's snap shot scraped the crossbar and found the back of the upper right corner just 6:33 into the game.\n\nThen Orlov, who was recently split up with usual blue-line partner Matt Niskanen in an attempt by first-year coach Todd Reirden to seek a spark amid the sluggish start, set up Wilson in his season debut. Orlov maneuvered around Dumba and fed Wilson for a one-timer with 27.4 seconds left before the first intermission .\n\nRyan Suter was chasing Wilson, who was caught between the defenseman and Devan Dubnyk in a collision that knocked the Wild goalie to the ice and left him down and dazed for a moment. Wilson picked up a goaltender interference penalty while scoring the goal. He was second in the NHL in penalty minutes last season.\n\n\"The puck went in the net before he touched the goalie, so there wasn't much you could do about it,\" Boudreau said. \"That's the way he plays.\"\n\nEric Staal thought he had a goal for the Wild early in the second period, but that was waved off because he kicked the puck, one of several near-misses for the Wild. Instead, Burakovsky scored soon after for a 3-0 lead. Suter and Dumba, the first blue-line pair, were on the ice for each of the first three goals.\n\n\"It didn't look like we were connecting very well, and some of the mental mistakes we made are going to cost you against a good offensive team,\" Staal said.\n\nThe Wild went a whopping 14:03 without a shot on goal, until Staal's wrist shot was stopped by Copley. Koivu's backhander trickled through Copley's pads to put the Wild on the board about a minute later, and Marcus Foligno tried to keep the momentum going by dropping the gloves and fighting Wilson. The Wild had 22 of their 28 shots in the second half of the game, but they just couldn't convert enough of those chances.\n\nWilson just finished serving his fourth suspension in a little more than a year, this for a blindside hit to the head of an opponent during a preseason game . His presence gave Washington's lagging penalty kill a boost.\n\n\"I didn't expect him to have as strong a game as he did,\" Rierden said.\n\nDumba's goal was the only tally for Minnesota in six power-play opportunities. The Capitals, who entered the night ranked third-worst in the league on the penalty kill, allowed six power-play goals over their previous four games.\n\nNOTES: This was the eighth straight win by the Capitals over the Wild, whose last win in the series was at Washington on March 5, 2015. All but one of the victories by the Capitals during the streak have come in regulation. ... This was the third two-goal game of Orlov's 382-game career. ... Staal has 30 goals and 44 assists in 77 career games against the Capitals, his most points against any other team. ... With his 341st career goal, Parise passed Dave Christian to become the leading scorer among Minnesota-born players in NHL history. ... Dubnyk stopped 28 shots.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCapitals: Play at Winnipeg on Wednesday.\n\nWild: Host Pacific Division-leading Vancouver on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL coverage: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Lightning backup Louis Domingue finished with 17 saves.\n\nAfter slamming his stick on the glass as the game ended, Kucherov's frustrations carried over into the locker room upon being reminded of his two missed opportunities.\n\n\"My thoughts? It (stinks) when you don't score,\" he said. \"Sometimes it happens. It happened today. For us, forget this game as soon as possible and move forward.\"\n\nThe Sabres limited the NHL's top offense to one goal after Tampa Bay had scored four or more in each of its past five games.\n\nSkinner opened the scoring with 2:15 left in the first period, when he was parked in front and converted a rebound after Domingue stopped Sam Reinhart's shot from the top of the right circle.\n\nThe Sabres somehow matched the Lightning in scoring one goal apiece in the second period despite being outshot 14-2.\n\nHutton held the fort in making numerous clutch stops starting from the opening minute, when he foiled Stamkos driving in alone across the front.\n\nOkposo put Buffalo up 2-0 at the 5:43 mark of the period when he used defender Victor Hedman as a screen and scored on a low shot from the right circle that fooled Domingue.\n\nThe Lightning responded 15 seconds later, when Alex Killorn flipped a pass from his own blue line and over two Sabres defenders, including a leaping Rasmus Dahlin. The puck landed on the stick of Cirelli, who scored on a breakaway by beating Hutton high on the glove side.\n\nThe Sabres' three-game winning streak is their second of the season. Buffalo won three straight just once a year ago, when the team finished last in the NHL standings for the third time in five seasons.\n\nThough relieved to pull out the win, Okposo said the Sabres were too passive in trying to nurse the one-goal lead.\n\n\"We were on our heels a little too much,\" he said. \"We weren't sharp. We've got to clean up some stuff. I know we've won the last three games, but we probably only played real good for a period and a half.\"\n\nOkposo then laughed when asked if he would've complained after a three-game winning streak last season.\n\n\"Yeah, probably not,\" he said. \"But our standard's higher this year.\"\n\nNOTES: Lightning D Erik Cernak made his NHL debut after being called up from Syracuse of the AHL earlier in the day. The 21-year-old replaced Anton Stralman, who missed his second game with an upper-body injury. ... The Sabres are 6-2-1 at home, a year after matching a franchise low with 11 home wins. ... Sabres C Patrik Berglund was a healthy scratch, with C Zemgus Girgensons returning after being a healthy scratch against Vancouver on Saturday. ... Lightning LW Adam Erne left the ice holding his jaw after being struck by a shot from teammate Ryan Callahan with 6:44 left in the second. Erne returned before the period was over.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLightning: Continue four-game road trip at Pittsburgh on Thursday night.\n\nSabres: Open three-game road trip at Winnipeg on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

You get a chance to fix it quickly.\"\n\nThe Buffaloes showed some early rust, but relied on their stingy defense until the offense found some rhythm. They out-rebounded Drake by a 44-29 margin and kept the turnovers to a minimum \u2014 until garbage time.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nDrake: The Bulldogs kept up with Colorado when the 3-pointers were falling. They were 7 of 18 in the first half from long range, and 4 of 19 in the second. \"I thought we really struggled to get in any kind of flow because of their defense,\" DeVries said.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes improved to 30-9 over the past three seasons in nonconference regular season games.\n\nBATTEY'S PRESENCE\n\nRedshirt freshman Evan Battey made his Colorado debut nearly 11 months after suffering a stroke. He steadily regained feeling on his right side while his speech is constantly improving. Battey finished with eight points in 20 minutes.\n\n\"We're happy for Evan and glad to see him back out there,\" McKinley Wright said. \"He's going to be big for us this year.\"\n\nDRAKE & DRAKE\n\nIt was a Drake-themed night with the school from Iowa in town, filled with plenty of music from the rapper/song writer. There was a Drake trivia contest and a name-that-tune challenge. Even the Buffaloes' mascot got into the act by dressing in Drake-style clothing.\n\nTHIS & THAT\n\nThe Buffaloes were without sophomore guard D'Shawn Schwartz, who sat out a game for an NCAA infraction. Schwartz played in a non-certified summer league game outside of the allowable dates of competition. He saw action in 18 games last season. ...

She encouraged people to choose \"kindness over hatred.\" She spoke before addressing an event about the opioid crisis in the East Room of the White House. (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO/EPA-EFE)\n\nWASHINGTON - Melania Trump's unexpected feud with a national security official exploded Tuesday when the first lady publicly called for the official's firing.\n\nThe quarrel between the first lady and deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel apparently began during a trip Trump took to Africa last month. Two officials told USA TODAY that Ricardel argued with Trump's staff over airplane seating for the first lady's trip.\n\nThey accused Ricardel, who wound up not going to Africa, of spreading false stories about the incident. The officials said Ricardel had clashed with other staff members as well.\n\nBut on Tuesday, more than a month after the trip, the feud became very public when the first lady released a statement saying Ricardel should be fired.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she (Ricardel) no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" said a statement from Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's communications director.\n\nMore: First Lady Melania Trump has never met the security official she wants fired: official\n\nHere's a little more about Ricardel, taken from previous USA TODAY reporting, statements from the Trump administration, her resume on LinkedIn and comments she made to Congress during a Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nRicardel's roots with the Trump administration go back to the president's transition team, before he took office. Over the years, she's served in three administrations and held a variety of roles in different government agencies, including in the Commerce, State and Defense departments.\n\nHer high-profile roles in Washington go back to a stint at the State Department in the 1980s and later as a legislative assistant for Republicans in the Senate. Ricardel also worked on Sen. Bob Dole's failed presidential campaign in 1996.\n\nThe two appeared to remain close over the years, though, and Ricardel mentioned Dole's role in mentoring her during a Congressional testimony last year.\n\nUnder former President George W. Bush, Ricardel worked in the Defense Department as a deputy assistant secretary for defense in Eurasia after the September 11 attacks, serving a major role in the region and helping coordinate where troops and other assets would be stationed.\n\nShe also has extensive experience in the private sector, working for Boeing for more about a decade before joining the president's team.\n\nAfter helping on President Donald Trump's transition, she served as a special assistant to the president before the president nominated her last year as undersecretary for export administration in the Commerce Department.\n\nShe wasn't in the role for long. Ricardel was nabbed by National security adviser John Bolton when he came into the role earlier this year and was appointed his No. 2.\n\nCLOSE First lady Melania Trump says she could be \"the most bullied person\" in the world, judging by \"what people are saying about me.\" (Oct. 11) AP\n\n\"I selected her as Deputy National Security Advisor because her expertise is broad-based and includes national security matters related to our alliances, defense posture, technology security, foreign security assistance, and arms control,\" Bolton said in a statement at the time.\n\nRicardel's roots include Europe. Her father was an immigrant who ended up in the United States after leaving Croatia.\n\nShe talked about him in Congressional testimony last year, telling senators her late-father came to America with \"little more than optimism in his pockets.\"\n\n\"He was always optimistic about what was possible in this great Nation--a view that carried him from communist-controlled Croatia via Germany to the United States,\" she said during testimony for a Commerce Department role.\n\nRicardel graduated from Georgetown University and completed her doctoral studies at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. She lived in California before moving back to Washington to work in the Trump administration.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/13/who-mira-ricardel-first-lady-melania-trump-wants-her-fired/1994774002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Special to USA TODAY, Matthew Wilson, Special to USA TODAY", "title": "'The Conners' recap: A little politics, a little religion and a lot of grief", "description": "\u201cThe Conners\u201d go to church, Dad struggles with his faith in the wake of his wife\u2019s death and Darlene\u2019s son navigates political lines at the polls.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/13/conners-little-politics-little-religion-and-lot-grief/1995912002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/14/USAT/3814dbec-9f38-4fb6-a0a8-4135bc2b81d9-150330_2412.jpg?crop=2999,1683,x0,y19&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T03:14:16Z", "content": "At a special screening for first episode of spin-off \"The Conners,\" stars Lecy Goranson, Michael Fishman and Maya Lynne Robinson talk Roseanne Barr's exit from the original show.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nPoor field conditions at Estadio Azteca forced the NFL to move Monday night's Chiefs-Rams game to Los Angeles. (Photo: Christian Palma, AP)\n\nWhat a mess, NFL.\n\nAnd just think: It could have been way worse.\n\nThe quick decision by the league on Tuesday to bolt from Mexico City \u2014 scrapping the threat of a potential disaster \u2014 wasn\u2019t really much of a choice.\n\nImagine if Todd Gurley or Patrick Mahomes tore up a knee while sliding around on a sloppy field at Estadio Azteca on Monday night.\n\nOr if Jared Goff, Tyreek Hill and Aaron Donald simply refused to play.\n\nNo, the no-brainer decision to move the \u201cmidseason Super Bowl\u201d between the Rams and the Chiefs to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was essentially made for the NFL, in consultation with the NFL Players Association, when transposed against the integrity of the game and safety of the players.\n\nThere\u2019s no wiggle room there. The NFL, with a litany of bruises to its image in recent years, couldn\u2019t dare risk the possibility of blowing this one after it became apparent that the field conditions were atrocious.\n\nYet it makes you wonder: A little more than two years since horrendous field conditions forced the cancellation of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio, how could the NFL even come close to staging a game at a stadium with a shoddy field.\n\nI\u2019m guessing someone checked the schedule and figured the Shakira concert couldn\u2019t be an issue. The concert was on Oct. 11 \u2014 five weeks before Chiefs-Rams. But reportedly, the concert left the natural grass field shambles. Add a few soccer games and apparently too much rain to the mix, and it comes to this different type of audible.\n\nThe particular venue in Mexico City, by the way, is notorious for its turf issues. Sure, the Patriots and Raiders played there last season without a blip, but people who closely follow soccer know the reputation that now has a fresh chapter.\n\nHere\u2019s to contingency plans. And a quick about-face ... to avoid egg-on-face.\n\nAs reports and the turf-monster photos circulated early on Tuesday to document the crisis, the NFL stood firm in declaring that it planned for the show to go on. Given the NFL\u2019s ability to turn wheels in a pinch, it seemed plausible. (Quick, get George Toma on a jet. Toma might be 89, but he\u2019s only semi-retired, having worked the last Super Bowl).\n\nThink again. Despite the work that began to re-sod the field, the plug was pulled later on Tuesday.\n\nNo need to risk having the Rams and Chiefs hit the field for pregame warmups, only to discover that the surface wasn\u2019t of NFL quality after all. Besides, rush jobs tend to escalate risk.\n\nRemember, the Hall of Fame Game? That fiasco in 2016, days after a concert, included a sticky surface caused by the painting for logos and markers. On that night, the NFL tried to wait it out, failing to quickly cancel the game while fans in the stadium bought concessions and souvenirs, thinking they were set to ultimately see the \u201cB team\u201d versions of the Packers and Colts.\n\nIn this case, there won\u2019t even be a temptation to force it.\n\nOne of the hard lessons that the league took from Canton revolved around outsourcing field management services that contributed to the issues. At this point, it\u2019s unclear how the field management services were handled in Mexico City.\n\nBut another takeaway from Canton was the pledge by the NFL and NFLPA to seek better methods for testing the quality of fields. As questions about field conditions ramped up this week, the NFLPA dispatched a field inspector to Mexico City.\n\nYet by the time the inspector arrived on Tuesday, the game \u2014 which was designated as a Rams home game \u2014 was already switched to L.A.\n\nThe ramifications could be significant for the NFL\u2019s efforts on the international stage. It\u2019s one more reason for coaches or other detractors from teams to loathe games in non-NFL stadiums. And given the plans that just went awry for fans who pegged Mexico City as a \u201cdestination game,\u201d just think of the costs that are sure to come in settling legal issues that will flow from this.\n\nAt least the big game will go on \u2014 1,500 miles away.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

The Devils won 4-2. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEWARK, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Taylor Hall gave the New Jersey Devils just what they needed after a dismal seven-game trip \u2014 an MVP-type performance.\n\nHall scored the game-winning goal on a breakaway at 8:07 of the third period added an empty-net tally to cap a four-point night and lead the Devils to a 4-2 victory over the struggling Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night.\n\nTravis Zajac and Damon Severson each had a goal and an assist as the Devils snapped a three-game losing streak by beating the Penguins for the second time in just over a week. Keith Kinkaid had 29 saves for New Jersey, which was returning home after a 1-6 trip.\n\n\"Not just a win but an effort we can be proud of,\" said Hall, last season's MVP. \"It's not an effort where we solely relied on our goaltender to steal a game. We did a good job of eliminating chances against a high-powered team. Our game has to continue to grow that way and when we play strong in our end, it allows us to just play more free up the ice and create more, have the puck more. It was solid night for us.\"\n\nPhil Kessel and Jake Guentzel scored for the Penguins, who have one win in seven games (1-5-1). Casey DeSmith had 31 saves in his third straight start.\n\n\"It's frustrating because we are trying to find wins right now and we can't seem to find them with any level of consistency,\" Penguins coach Mike Sulllivan said. \"I thought we had spurts in the game where we were good, then some of the goals they scored, we didn't force them to work hard enough for them. That for me is discouraging.\"\n\nHall's game-winner came a little less than four minutes after Guentzel tied the game. It came on a quick counterattack. Kyle Palmieri sent a pass from the Devils' defensive end to Zajac at the Penguins' blue line. Zajac sent a pass to Hall coming down the middle, and last year's MVP made one move and slid a soft shot between DeSmith's legs.\n\n\"He called for it,\" Zajac said of the pass to Hall. \"I kind of saw him, but he called for it and I just had to kind of whack it over to him and he made a great play.\"\n\nDeSmith was clearly frustrated after the play. He seemed to read Hall's move and felt he got a piece of the puck.\n\n\"We had worked hard to tie it up and like I said, the team needed a save and I didn't make it in that situation. I feel responsible for that,\" DeSmith said.\n\nThe Devils, who are 6-1-1 at home, took leads of 1-0 and 2-1 only to see the Penguins tie it.\n\nGuentzel's sixth goal of the season tied the game at 2 after withstanding a challenge by New Jersey coach John Hynes, who claimed Sidney Crosby interfered with Kinkaid.\n\nKinkaid had stopped Crosby's semi-breakaway, but the skate of the Penguins' star knocked the goaltender to the ice, leaving Guentzel an open net to shoot at with the rebound.\n\nAfter reviewing the goal, the referees ruled Devils forward Blake Coleman caused the problem by pushing Crosby in the back.\n\nZajac scored just 28 seconds into the game after DeSmith had trouble covering a Severson rebound.\n\nThe Penguins tied the score 1-all with Kessel's power-play goal at 13:19. Crosby held the puck in the right circle and fired a pass to Kessel stationed at the left edge of the net for a slam dunk.\n\nNew Jersey grabbed the lead again in the second period. After DeSmith stopped Hall in close, New Jersey kept the puck in the zone and Severson scored from between the circles after taking a pass from Hall.\n\nNew Jersey thought it had a 3-1 lead at 14:20 when Jesper Bratt scored on a breakaway, but the officials had blown the play dead because Kessel and Brett Seney were fighting in the Pittsburgh end.\n\nThe Penguins nearly tied it on the ensuing Devils power play, but Bryan Rust's short-handed shot was kept out by a combination of Kinkaid and the goalpost.\n\nNOTES: Goaltender Martin Brodeur, who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame Monday, dropped a puck in a ceremonial opening faceoff before the game. ... Devils center Nico Hischier, the No. 1 pick overall in last year's draft, missed his first game with an upper-body injury. He is day to day.

The team sent a letter to the Korean Sport and Olympic Committee (KSOC) last week to outline their allegations.\n\nThe women, from a remote province famous for its garlic, captured hearts in a country that barely recognized curling before and became sought-after models for commercials.\n\nThe attention was so great during the games that their coach took away their cellphones to shield the curlers from any pressure. The Garlic Girls ultimately lost to Sweden in the gold medal match.\n\nIn the letter, Kim Eun-jung, Kim Seon-yeong and Kim Cho-hee as well as the sisters Kim Yeong-ae and Kim Yeong-mi accused former Korean Curling Federation (KCF) vice-president Kim Kyong-doo of verbal abuse and team coaches of giving unreasonable orders and subjecting their private lives to excessive control.\n\n\"The human rights of the athletes are being violated,\" the athletes, the first Asian team to win a curling silver, wrote. \"We've reached a point where it has become unbearable.\"\n\nThe curlers also accused coaches of holding back prize money and trying to sideline captain Kim Eun-jung after learning of her plans to start a family.\n\nThe coaches \"tried to rule Kim Eun-jung off the team after she got married in July,\" the letter said. \"They separated the skip and the team captain's role to minimize Kim Eun-jung's status on the team.

Jacob Markstrom, starting for the ninth consecutive game with Anders Nilsson injured, finished with 29 saves.\n\nVancouver, coming off a 2-1 loss across town against the Rangers on Monday night, fell to 1-2-2 on a six-game trip.\n\n\"This was deflating,\" Canucks coach Travis Green said. \"It was one of those nights. I like how we battled back. But down two on the road, you can be a little tired. It was a disappointing loss.\"\n\nKuhnhackl got his second of the game at 3:26 of the third period as Eberle's pass from the right corner deflected off Kuhnhackl's stick, a Vancouver defenseman's stick, and then Kuhnhackl's skate and in to push the Islanders' lead to 4-2. The goal stood after a video review, giving Kuhnhackl his first career multi-goal game.\n\nClutterbuck scored a power-play goal with 2:54 left, the Islanders' first in four games with the man-advantage. It was also Clutterbuck's first goal since Jan. 13 against the Rangers.\n\n\"It's been a while,\" he said. \"The worst thing is there's a lot of self-doubt that creeps in.

Kuhnhackl tied it on a delayed penalty on Vancouver as he swiped a backhander from his knees while falling down below the left circle, and the puck managed to sneak in between Markstrom's right pad and the post at 5:11.\n\n\"I tried to spin away from the defenseman, and I thought I got tripped and they got a penalty,\" Kuhnhackl said, \"so I just tried to throw it on net and I was fortunate enough the puck went in.\"\n\nNew York went ahead when Bailey tried to send a pass across to Anders Lee at the right side of the net, but the puck deflected off the skate of Vancouver defenseman Christopher Tanev and in at 5:56. Barzal's assist on the play gave him 100 points for his career.\n\nEberle pushed the Islanders' lead to 3-1 as he took a pass from Nelson from the left corner and poked it past Markstrom from the right side in front with 5:10 left in the opening period. Nelson got his 200th career point.\n\nNOTES: Loui Eriksson had an assist on Virtanen's goal, giving him nine assists and 16 points in 16 games against the Islanders.

As was the case in the first three games, shooting from outside was a major issue and something Southeastern will have to remedy \u2014 although the Lions aren't likely to face the same level of defense in the Southland Conference they have so far. They missed 11 of their first 12 shots.\n\nTexas Tech: In its toughest test in the first three games, the Red Raiders showed the kind of grit that typified their 2017-18 season. The victory wasn't a thing of beauty by any means, but Culver showed a knack for taking a game over when needed and that will be important down the road.\n\nSTAT OF THE NIGHT: Both teams were a bit shaky with the ball. The Lions committed 15 turnovers and Tech had 12. But the Red Raiders were much more opportunistic with an 18-4 advantage in points off turnovers.\n\nTIP-INS: Culver (8 for 12), Odiase (3 for 3) and Coprew (2 for 2) combined to hit 13 of 17 field goals. The rest of Tech's roster was 9 of 29. . Neither team finished with a positive assist-to-turnover ratio. The Lions had 15 turnovers and seven assists, while the Raiders had 12 of each.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSoutheastern Louisiana: The Lions head back home after a grinding four games, three on the road, over an eight-day stretch. They host Stetson on Saturday.\n\nTexas Tech: The Red Raiders head to Kansas City, Mo., and will play Southern California on Monday in the Hall of Fame Classic.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Panthers are 7-5-3, while the Flyers are 9-8-1.\n\nJust eight seconds after Voracek tied the game, Luongo stoned him on a breakaway after Nolan Patrick won the face-off. Oskar Lindblom hit a post on a shot a few minutes later for Philadelphia.\n\n\"I thought I had him but I was unlucky,\" Lindblom said.\n\nDown 2-0 after two periods, the Flyers came out with energy to start the third. Voracek snapped a shot from the right side past Luongo for his fifth goal to cut the deficit in half.\n\nBut they couldn't get another one past the veteran.\n\n\"They made a strong push, they were flying all over the ice and had us on our heels but Lu made a couple big saves,\" Florida's Mike Hoffman said.\n\nEkblad scored his first goal this season to give the Panthers a 1-0 lead almost midway through the second period. Shortly after Ivan Provorov's tripping penalty gave Florida a power play, Frank Vatrano deflected Hoffman's slap shot and the puck trickled to the left side of the net. Ekblad flipped a backhander that hit goaltender Brian Elliott's stick and glove before going into the net.\n\n\"I was just trying to whack it toward the next and got lucky,\" Ekblad said. \"It has been a while. I never waited this long to score a goal at any level. It's tough to stay resilient.\"\n\nHoffman has a point in 13 straight games, tying Pavel Bure's franchise.\n\nDadonov made it 2-0 late in the second period on his eighth goal. He skated from his blue line up the ice and fired a wrister from just outside the right circle into the top shelf.\n\n\"They're a good, underrated team,\" Flyers captain Claude Giroux said.\n\nNOTES: The Flyers beat the Panthers 6-5 in a shootout on Oct. 16. The teams meet one more time. ... Panthers began a season-high six-game road trip. ... Flyers played the middle game of a five-game homestand. ... Dadonov has four goals in the last six games.

(AP) \u2014 The Race to the CME Globe will be more frantic starting next year, and the winner of the LPGA Tour's season-ending tournament is going to get considerably richer.\n\nTour and event officials announced Tuesday night that the CME Group Tour Championship's purse in 2019 will double to $5 million, with the winner getting $1.5 million \u2014 the largest first-place share in women's golf history.\n\nThe biggest winner's check and purse on the LPGA Tour this season were both at the U.S. Women's Open, where Ariya Jutanugarn won $900,000 of the $5 million total purse.\n\n\"To think that the best players in the world won't be paying more attention to the CME Group Tour Championship next year would be wrong,\" LPGA Tour Commissioner Mike Whan said.\n\nThere's another key change for next season, in that all the points in the season-long Race to the CME Globe will be thrown out before the finale. There are 12 players out of 72 in the field at Tiburon Golf Club this week with a chance to win the Globe, and five of those 12 are assured to hoist the trophy if they win Sunday. The other seven players can win the Globe through various scenarios, many of which are complex.\n\nNext year, it's very simple: The top 60 players in the points race, including ties, will qualify for the finale. Points then get thrown out entirely, and the tournament winner \u2014 whether she was ranked No. 1 or No. 60 coming into the event \u2014 will win the Globe.\n\nPlayers are applauding bigger purses. The format change isn't exactly getting unanimous approval.\n\n\"I was a little disappointed, just that they were getting rid of the season-long race,\" said Brooke Henderson of Canada, one of the five women who would clinch the Globe automatically with a win this week. \"I think that was a good motivation for a lot of players to win a lot of events. ... But at the same time, it's really exciting to know that we have a ginormous purse in one tournament.\"\n\nWhan said the credit for the change goes to CME Group chairman and CEO Terry Duffy, who was the one who came up with the idea to double the purse and change the format for the Globe finale.\n\n\"I want anybody to be able to win this,\" Duffy said. \"That's what really makes it exciting for the fans.\"\n\nThis year's tournament starts Thursday. Henderson, Ariya Jutanugarn, Minjee Lee, Nasa Hataoka and Sung Hyun Park are the five who are assured of winning the Globe if they win the tournament.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It's a post that has been empty since former ambassador Joseph Westphal left in January 2017.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Abizaid would become ambassador as the Trump administration is weighing the U.S. response to the killing of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nTurkish officials claim Khashoggi was killed by a 15-member assassination squad sent from Riyadh on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi government.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has revoked the visas of the Saudis implicated in the killing. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said additional measures will be taken.\n\nAbizaid, who retired in 2007, served in wars in Grenada, the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. Following the war in Iraq, Abizaid assumed control of CENTCOM, which overseas military operations in 20 nations stretching from northeast Africa to the Middle East to Central and South Asia.\n\nAbizaid, of Nevada, currently works as a private consultant and is a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Previously, he was the distinguished chair of the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He also served in various senior positions on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/13/john-abizaid-trump-picks-retired-general-saudi-arabia-ambassador/1995843002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "This massive 'ghost galaxy' was caught hiding by the Milky Way", "description": "An international team of scientists has found a massive galaxy that has been hiding near the Milky Way.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/tech/science/2018/11/13/-massive-ghost-galaxy-caught-hiding-milky-way/38517055/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5966422410001_5966418637001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T02:32:57Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Brown, Jackson rally Georgia Southern past George Mason", "description": "Tookie Brown tossed in 25 points and Quan Jackson scored 21 points _ all in the second half _ to rally Georgia Southern from a 20-point deficit to a 98-89 victory over George Mason", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/13/brown-jackson-rally-georgia-southern-past-george-mason/38523157/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T02:31:44Z", "content": "STATESBORO, Ga.

Cleveland's first win came against Atlanta on Oct. 30.\n\nCleveland's injury list grew longer while the losses piled up. Forwards Kyle Korver (sore right foot) and Cedi Osman (back spasms) didn't play Tuesday and are the most recent additions.\n\nAll-Star forward Kevin Love (foot surgery), starting point guard George Hill (hamstring) and forward Sam Dekker (ankle) have also been sidelined.\n\nCavaliers coach Larry Drew gave a rundown of the team's injuries in his pregame media session and then asked, \"Who'm I missing?

(AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 The second act of Louisville's Chris Mack era produced the same outcome as the first, but this time the Cardinals came away with a much better showing.\n\nJordan Nwora scored a career-high 20 points as the Cardinals (2-0) easily dominated Southern 104-54 Tuesday night. Malik Williams also posted a career high of 17 points in the rout.\n\nAfter Nicholls State stayed close with Louisville in last week's season opener, Mack used the practices to toughen up his players in preparation for a schedule that includes eight games against teams ranked in the AP's preseason top 10. Mack saw improvement on both sides of the court as the Cardinals shot 58.2 percent and forced 23 turnovers.\n\n\"The three practices that we had leading up to tonight really set the tone,\" he said. \"I really think you earn the right to win and you earn your victories in practice because that's who you become on game night.\"\n\nSouthern coach Sean Woods said he noticed a marked difference from the team he observed in game film.\n\n\"Handling pressure, making shots, executing high-low situations, so I tip my hat off to coach Mack because he's been working on getting his guys better,\" Woods said.\n\nOne of the players Mack wanted to see improve was Nwora. The sophomore forward came off the bench and scored 15 points in the first half. He provided an immediate spark, scoring a layup off a Jaguars turnover just two seconds after checking in. He later got frontcourt steals on consecutive possessions that he turned into back-to-back dunks, the latter of which made it 21-9 with 11:32 remaining.\n\nLouisville kept pulling away throughout the game, leading by as many as 53 points in the final minute. Mack used 13 players, with none playing more than 22 minutes. A dozen Cardinals ended up scoring.\n\n\"After the last game, I don't think a lot of people were happy with our performance, especially not the coaches,\" said Nwora, who made 7-of-11 shots. \"We just had to get better, and that's the way he woke us up. Just having some drills in practice that really brought out the toughness in some guys.\"\n\nAaron Ray led the Jaguars (0-3) with 14 points and eight rebounds.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSouthern: Facing its third major conference foe in a week, the Jaguars again struggled as they shot just 39.1 percent. They also had a hard time keeping up with bigger, more athletic Cardinals. By halftime, Southern committed 21 fouls, with two players picking up four each. The Jaguars finished getting whistled for 39 fouls. Three players fouled out, with four more drawing four each.\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals looked much more at ease Tuesday after struggling in their season opener. In addition to the practices, it may have been due to the size advantage Louisville enjoyed over the Jaguars, who did not start anyone taller than 6-foot-7. Louisville outrebounded Southern 37-22 and enjoyed a 38-20 scoring advantage in the paint.\n\nLOCKER ROOM CLOSED\n\nPrior to the game, Louisville announced its locker room would be closed for postgame interviews, per Mack's decision. The program had been one of the few to allow locker room access during the regular season. The NCAA maintains an open locker room policy during the March tournament.\n\nAGAU RETURNS\n\nTuesday marked the return of Akoy Agau to the Cardinals. The graduate transfer from Southern Methodist played 22 games for the Cardinals before leaving the program in late 2014 to play for Georgetown. The 6-foot-8 forward scored seven points and tied Nwora with a team-high seven rebounds against the Jaguars.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouthern travels to Fairfax, Va., for a Saturday game at George Mason as part of the Emerald Coast Classic.\n\nLouisville concludes a three-game, season-opening homestand on Friday when it hosts Vermont.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSYDNEY (AP) \u2014 Brandt Snedeker hasn't played the Australian Open since 2007 but the memory of his costly mistake in the final round hasn't faded.\n\nSnedeker lost by a shot to Craig Parry when he called a penalty on himself on the 14th hole of the final round at The Australian Golf Club because the ball moved as he tried to shift some twigs around it.\n\n\"It was a no-brainer penalty,\" Snedeker said.\n\nA nine-time winner on the PGA Tour, Snedeker is joined by fellow Americans Matt Kuchar, who won last week's PGA Tour event in Mexico, and Keegan Bradley in the field this week at The Lakes, just down the road from The Australian.\n\n\"Really cool undulations, and the green complexes here are very difficult,\" Snedeker said after playing nine holes on the course for the first time. \"It's one of those places where you have to put the ball in the right spots on the greens to give yourself chances. If the wind blows, though, it's going to be survival.\"\n\nMissing from the Open this year are two of Australia's top players, Jason Day, whose wife is expecting a baby, and Adam Scott. Jordan Spieth, a two-time champion, has also decided not to travel Down Under this year, and the field is one of the weakest for the tournament in years.\n\nGeoff Ogilvy, who won the Australian Open at The Lakes in 2010, was quoted as saying in Golf Australia magazine that he's disappointed the tournament, first played in 1904, isn't what it was back in the days when Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Arnold Palmer and Greg Norman were adding their names to the Stonehaven Cup.\n\nThe prize money of 1.25 million Australian dollars ($903,000) and A$225,000 ($163,000) to the winner this year can't compete with other tournaments around the world.\n\n\"We are now playing the Australian Open for less money than when I turned professional two decades ago,\" Ogilvy said. \"It was a big tournament back then. Played towards the end of the northern hemisphere summer it was surrounded by a few other big events. So players from elsewhere could bring their families and make the long trip worthwhile. It made sense.\"\n\nOgilvy said the increasing investment in rival tours means players and sponsor money is going elsewhere.\n\n\"The economic clout of the PGA Tour has done much to ruin so many events held outside the United States,\" Ogilvy said. \"Only those in the Middle East and maybe the HSBC event in China have been able to compete financially.\"\n\nKuchar on Wednesday said the Australian Open's history, and not the prize money, is a reason he's in Sydney.\n\n\"It adds to the allure of coming and playing and trying to put your name on that list of champions,\" Kuchar said. \"It is a national Open ... golf's such a big part of sport and people's lives in Australia.\"\n\nThe Australian Open field should improve next year when it is moved to the week before the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne. The 2019 Open is scheduled Dec. 5-8 at The Australian.\n\nTraditionally, many of the top U.S. and International players in the Presidents Cup come to Australia a week early to get over jet lag and acclimatize to the Australian conditions.\n\nThe Australian Open will be the first qualifying tournament for next year's British Open at Royal Portrush, with the top three players not already exempt earning spots.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Skylar Mays' soaring, one-handed, frenzy-inciting jam on a determined drive down the lane made it clear he won't always be overshadowed by the highly regarded recruits that have made LSU basketball relevant again.\n\nMays scored 19 points, transfer Kavell Bigby-Williams added a career-high 14, and No. 22 LSU held off a relentless effort by first-year coach Penny Hardaway's Memphis squad, 85-76 on Tuesday night.\n\n\"It felt good, mainly because it could get the other guys going. I felt like it was a spark,\" Mays said of his first-half dunk. \"I told the guys, that's about it for the year. That's all I've got in me. I'm getting old, man \u2014 third year in.\"\n\nEach of LSU's three freshmen starters \u2014 Naz Reid, Ja'Vonte Smart and Emmitt Williams \u2014 scored 11 points. Williams also grabbed 10 rebounds for the Tigers (3-0), who trailed briefly with about 13 minutes to go before surging ahead for good with a pivotal 12-1 run that included back-to-back 3s by Mays and Reid. Smart set up Reid's 3 with a behind-the-back bounce pass from the right wing.\n\n\"It just showed we have a lot of guys that can come about and make plays any given night, so that makes us a really dangerous team,\" said Mays, who was a freshman on LSU's 2016-17 squad that went 10-21 overall and 2-16 in Southeastern Conference play. \"I was here when we were pretty low, so you know I'm just happy to be part of a team that I feel is special, that is going to win a lot of games. And I feel like we've got a lot of guys that obviously can play at the next level.\"\n\nMemphis freshman Tyler Harris, who missed all six of his shots and didn't score in his debut, was 6 of 13 on 3s and finished with 20 points in his second collegiate game.\n\nJeremiah Martin scored 15 points and Kyvon Davenport had 10 for Memphis (1-1), which remained within single digits for most of the game.\n\n\"We took the punch and hit back and got back into the game,\" Hardaway said. \"We couldn't finish it but I'm proud of my guys.\"\n\nMays scored from all over the court, mixing his crowd-pleasing dunk with his usual array of perimeter shots. He hit three times from 3-point range.\n\nLSU had trouble distancing itself from Memphis most of the night but appeared in control for most of the final 10 minutes, when its highlights included a roundhouse dunk from Williams and Reid's double-pump, back-to-the-basket, no-look scoop off the glass that made it 74-64 with 4:35 to go.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMemphis: The way Memphis played on the road against a ranked team provided an early indication that Hardaway's first season at the helm could turn out better that the fourth-place finish predicted in the AAC preseason coaches' poll. When Harris found his shot from the perimeter, it opened up opportunities inside for Davenport and Martin.\n\n\"We can be very special when we buy into our roles. What we showed tonight was a lot of fight on the road with a young team,\" Hardaway said. \"We can do a lot of great things this season.\"\n\nLSU: The Tigers' dramatic upgrade in talent was evident in the fact they led 48-39 at halftime despite Tremont Waters, their best player from last season, not scoring at all to that point. Mays also asserted himself more, scoring more points in the first half than in either of his previous two full games. Waters finished with eight points and eight assists. LSU's top freshman reserve, Darius Days, had nine points and six rebounds.\n\nHUSTLE POINTS\n\nBigby-Williams, a 6-foot-11 transfer from Oregon, never scored more than 11 in a game for the Ducks. He's expected to be relied upon primarily for defense this season, but made all seven of his shots against Memphis, including an emphatic dunk that gave LSU a 10-point lead with seven minutes remaining.\n\n\"It's important for him to understand that even though he does such a great job on defense, that he's capable of scoring,\" Mays said. \"I feel like he's only going to skyrocket from this game.\"\n\nWade said Bigby-Williams' perfect shooting night was indicative of his gritty, unselfish approach because he limits his shot-selection to high-percentage opportunities around the basket.\n\n\"The hardest move he made was his left-hand jump-hook and his left-hand jump hook's money,\" Wade said. \"Everything else was right there at the rim. ... When he focuses on the right things, the offense kind of takes care of itself.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMemphis hosts Yale on Saturday night.\n\nLSU hosts Louisiana Tech on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Ethan Hyman/The News & Observer via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Devon Daniels didn't fret or change much after a pair of bad offensive outputs to start his North Carolina State career.\n\nRather, he took a simple mindset: play hard.\n\nThe Utah transfer scored 20 points to lead the Wolfpack's latest high-scoring performance, a 100-49 win against UNC Asheville on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I think I was just overthinking it,\" Daniels said. \"I was focusing on just fitting in with the team and getting comfortable. Tonight I focused on playing really hard and trusting my teammates, and I think that helped a lot.\"\n\nDaniels led an easy night for the Wolfpack (3-0), though the team lost starting point guard Markell Johnson to an early injury and played with a shorter rotation the rest of the way.\n\nDaniels, a 6-foot-5 sophomore who sat out last year to satisfy NCAA transfer requirements, scored a combined 14 points while making 6 of 19 shots (32 percent) and 1 of 10 3-pointers in the first two games. He made 8 of 16 shots Tuesday, though only 1 of 5 from behind the arc, to go with nine rebounds in 26 minutes.\n\n\"I thought he relaxed,\" second-year Wolfpack coach Kevin Keatts said. \"I thought he was more comfortable tonight. I thought he played off his teammates and I'm happy for him.\"\n\nN.C. State shot 54 percent and led big nearly all night, pushing the margin to 29-7 with 5\u00bd minutes left before halftime to remove all doubt on the outcome.\n\nTajion Jones scored 21 points for the Bulldogs (1-1), who missed 13 of their first 15 shots to get in a fast hole and committed 24 turnovers \u2014 several coming in the backcourt against pressure. The Wolfpack converted those into 33 points.\n\n\"We were able to do a decent job in the first half of guarding them, when we didn't give them the ball,\" UNC Asheville first-year coach Mike Morrell said. \"Against a team like that, your defense really starts on offense by not just allowing them runout dunks and layups.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nUNC Asheville: Consider this a teachable moment for Morrell with his young bunch of Bulldogs. Morrell had spent the past seven seasons working under Shaka Smart, first at VCU and then at Texas. He has a group with practically no returning experience, featuring a combined five starts and 141 points (5.5 percent of the offense) back from last year. UNC Asheville beat NAIA program St. Andrews by 40 last week, but things were predictably overwhelming on the road against an Atlantic Coast Conference opponent.\n\n\"The shots that we got were not good looks,\" Morrell said. \"They were highly contested looks. ... We've got to do a better job of cleaner, better shots. And that starts with me.\"\n\nN.C. State: Add another lopsided win for a team that outscored its first two opponents 200-104, though Johnson's departure \u2014 along with the recent transfer of freshman forward Ian Steere after 5 minutes of opening-night action \u2014 left the Wolfpack with nine players for most of this one.\n\nJOHNSON'S DEPARTURE\n\nJohnson, last year's ACC assists leader, left at the 16:24 mark after being blindsided by a backcourt screen from Jeremy Peck.

He was active all over the court. He had the spark. Everybody else just followed.\"\n\nThat was the kind of effort Mick Cronin saw in practice from Williams, who scored just four points against Ohio State in the opener.\n\n\"The real reason he started?\" Cronin said, \"Keith's effort in practice the last three days.

Vivian Stringer's 1,000th career victory, the Hall of Fame coach took a moment to soak it all in.\n\nShe was surrounded by family, friends, former players and coaches from all three schools where she coached.\n\n\"Let me tell you something, sometimes people ask how did I accomplish these things?\" Stringer said. \"This was only done with my family first of all and they mean everything in the world. They lifted me up.\"\n\nStringer became the fifth Division I women's basketball coach to achieve the milestone and sixth woman overall when the Scarlet Knights beat Central Connecticut State 73-44 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Hall of Fame coach joined Pat Summitt, Geno Auriemma, Tara VanDerveer and Sylvia Hatchell in the 1,000-victory club. Division II coach Barbara Stevens also has won over 1,000 games. The 70-year-old Stringer is the first African-American coach to reach the milestone.\n\nAs the final seconds ran down, the 4,583 fans held up signs and chanted the coach's name. Her current team dumped a Gatorade bucket full of the confetti over their coach's head.\n\nVideo tributes from all the other living Division I members of the 1,000-win club were played as Stringer sat under balloons that spelled out CVS1K. Stringer also received many online tributes on social media, including one from Hillary Clinton . Rutgers presented her with a banner to celebrate her 1,000th win that will hang in the arena's rafters. She also received a customized pair of shoes that listed the number of wins she had each of her three schools \u2014 Cheyney State, Iowa and Rutgers.\n\nMany of her former players were on hand to witness the milestone victory. She's 1,000-402 in her career. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy was also sitting courtside for the historic win.\n\nSouth Carolina coach Dawn Staley also made the trip to New Jersey with her staff that included Jolette Law, who was an assistant for Stringer at Rutgers for many years and played for her at Iowa.\n\n\"I know that coach Law fooled me this morning saying she couldn't come to the celebration because she had the scout,\" Stringer said. \"One of the young ladies came from Hawaii. She flew in and is going to fly back. Maybe I'm doing some things right. People genuinely do care. Something my father said a long time ago, don't give me flowers when I'm gone let me know what you feel now.\"\n\nStaley's Gamecocks play on Thursday against Clemson. She said she had no doubt in her mind she should be at Rutgers for this game with all that Stringer has meant to African-American coaches.\n\n\"It's legacy,\" Staley said. \"She's meant so much to the game and I'm here to celebrate with her.\"\n\nWhile Stringer remembers many of the victories over her 48-year coaching career, one that she doesn't recall is her first one at Cheyney State. In fact, no one can specifically remember who her team beat to get that first victory. Stringer laughs about it now, saying that she had no idea she'd be still coaching nearly five decades later and win 1,000 games.\n\nWhile it took Stringer five tries to get win No. 900 in 2013, her team took care of reaching this milestone on its first try. The Scarlet Knights (3-0) scored 10 of the first 13 points and never looked back building a 37-17 halftime lead.\n\nStringer was concerned before the game that her team would be under a lot of pressure to win with so many people coming to celebrate the momentous victory. Her team made sure they wouldn't go home disappointed. Caitlin Jenkins had 14 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Scarlet Knights.\n\nKiana Patterson led Central Connecticut State with 25 points, including the 1,000th of her career.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan knew things wouldn't always go quite as smoothly for Nick Mullens as they did in his first start.\n\nSo when Mullens followed up his record-setting debut with a spottier performance that included two interceptions and a failed late drive, Shanahan wasn't overly concerned and remains committed to Mullens as the starter when the team returns from the bye next week.\n\n\"I think it's a positive experience,\" Shanahan said Tuesday. \"The guy's played one game in his career. I know statistically that was the best start in NFL history. I mean, I think Nick did some real good things yesterday, too. It was a little bit more of a challenge in some circumstances. ... What I liked about Nick is he never seemed rattled throughout the whole game, continued playing. He was great after the game. He was great watching film with him. I say it's a good experience or step forward because I think he'll get better from each experience he has.\"\n\nJust about everything went right for Mullens in his debut against the Oakland Raiders on Nov. 1, when he joined Hall of Famers Jim Kelly and Fran Tarkenton as the only players with at least 250 yards passing, three touchdown passes and no interceptions in the first career game. He also had the most efficient debut since the merger for a player with at least 20 attempts, posting a 151.9 rating in the 34-3 win.\n\nIt wasn't quite like that in a 27-23 loss to the New York Giants on Monday night. Mullens went 27 for 39 for 250 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nHe helped San Francisco (2-8) build a 10-point lead in the second half before the team blew it. Mullens then drove the Niners to the 21 in the closing minute before his last-ditch pass sailed out of the back of the end zone to send San Francisco to another loss.\n\nMullens' best play came in the third quarter when he went through several reads before finding running back Matt Breida for an 11-yard touchdown pass that made it 20-10.\n\nBut there were also some mistakes, like a slightly off-target pass to Marquise Goodwin that led to an interception in the second half and a late throw to Kendrick Bourne that led to an earlier pick in the first half that set up a New York touchdown.\n\n\"I thought he did some decent things last night,\" Shanahan said. \"He's a good pocket passer, so I want him to be perfect at it. He was pretty good on a number of his reads. He had a touchdown get into the last guy in his progression. Had a couple big plays, getting into number two and three. But, I want him to be automatic. I know that's what he wants to do, too. And we'll keep working at it until he is.\"\n\nThe 49ers should be healthy when they return from the bye with Shanahan predicting that everyone on the roster should be available to practice next week. That includes linebacker Reuben Foster, who missed the past two games with a hamstring injury, as well as receiver Pierre Garcon (knee) and safety Jaquiski Tartt (shoulder), who sat out Monday with injuries.\n\nDefensive backs K'Waun Williams (stinger) and receiver Goodwin were banged up in the game against the Giants but aren't expected to miss any time.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) \u2014 For most of his career, the fourth quarter is where Russell Wilson has thrived. His late game heroics of leading comebacks in the fourth quarter or overtime to win games take up nearly an entire page of Seattle's weekly game notes.\n\nExcept this year, when the fourth-quarter mistakes by Wilson have overshadowed his late-game successes. And those mistakes are part of the reason Seattle is 4-5 and faces such a critical game on Thursday night against Green Bay in the quest to stay in the NFC playoff conversation.\n\nSeattle is 1-8 in its last nine games decided by one score or less. Over the past two seasons, Seattle is 5-11 in one-score games. They used to be the types of games in which Seattle thrived, with Wilson finding a way to score and pull out a victory in the closing minutes, or defensively making the necessary stops to stem any late rally by an opponent.\n\nBut that page in Seattle's game notes detailing his 24 comebacks in the fourth quarter and overtime has just three entries over the past two seasons.\n\n\"There's two things there. It goes back to finishing right. If we can make one or two plays here or there across the board \u2014 offensive, defensive, special teams, whatever it may be \u2014 we can turn that around really easily. That's the great thing,\" Wilson said. \"The second thing is ... we're in every game and every game is really close and every game we're right there to win the game. I'm looking forward to that turning around. We have great confidence in that and what we're going to do.\"\n\nThere's no doubting that in stretches this season Wilson has played great. He's thrown for 14 touchdowns with just two interceptions over the past five games. And the success or failure of Seattle in the fourth quarter is not solely his responsibility.\n\nBut there's also been a pattern of crucial late-game mistakes by Wilson that has been a contributing factor to each of Seattle's five losses.\n\n\u2014 In a Week 1 loss at Denver, Seattle gained seven yards on its final three drives and Wilson threw an interception on a desperation throw on the final play of a 27-24 loss.\n\n\u2014 In Week 2 at Chicago, Wilson threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown with the Seahawks trailing 17-10, and on Seattle's next drive fumbled while being sacked. Seattle lost 24-17\n\n\u2014 In Week 5 against the Rams, Wilson missed on his final two passes with Seattle closing in on field goal range while down by two points with less than 4 minutes left. Seattle punted and never got the ball back in a 33-31 loss.\n\n\u2014 In Week 9, Wilson threw his second fourth-quarter interception that was returned for a touchdown when Desmond King stepped in front of a pass and the pick-six ended up being the deciding points in the Chargers' 25-17 win.\n\n\u2014 And last week, Wilson was stripped by Dante Fowler midway through the fourth quarter deep in Seattle's end. Brandin Cooks' TD run on the next play ended up being the deciding points in the Rams' 36-31 win.\n\nThe only one-score game the Seahawks have won this season was arguably one of its uglier performances when Sebastian Janikowski kicked a 52-yard field goal on the final play to beat Arizona in Week 4. And while several of those games have seen Wilson rebound from his mistakes to give Seattle a chance in the closing seconds, the final results are not what the Seahawks have come to expect.\n\n\"It's finishing at the right time, making the right play. We've been so good at those games for such a long time that the fact that it's not happening is a little bit unusual,\" Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \"I'm disappointed because we've been able to always feel like we're going to win those games and do it. We still have the same mentality about it and attitude about it, but we've got to show it. We've got to get those finishes done.\"\n\nNOTES: LB K.J.

They\u2019ll also look to have outside linebacker Derrick Morgan (shoulder) back in the lineup on defense.\n\nAs the passing game continues to grow, the Titans could also benefit from having emerging receiver Taywan Taylor (foot) back in action.\n\nWhile the Titans fared well without these key players against the Patriots, the team will hit the field even stronger once they\u2019re at full capacity.\n\nTennessee will be without running back David Fluellen, who\u2019s already been ruled out for Sunday\u2019s game with a knee injury. The Titans have added rusher Dalyn Hawkins to the active roster, releasing fullback Jalston Fowler to make room for him.\n\nWe\u2019ll also discuss\n\nThe Titans may be riding the high of a win against such a high-caliber team right now, but putting on a good performance for the remainder of the season is even more important than last week\u2019s matchup.\n\nThe Titans are going to need to keep pace with the Houston Texans \u2013 who have the second-easiest schedule ahead according to FPI \u2013 in order to keep their name in the playoff race. This starts with defeating the Indianapolis Colts on the road Sunday.\n\nThe AFC South division as a whole is wide-open, as the Titans stand just one game behind the Texans, with the Colts threatening from behind at 4-5.\n\nThe Titans still have the Colts, Texans, Jets, Jaguars, Giants, Redskins and a second meeting with Indianapolis in store before the NFL regular season comes to a close."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "TCU senior Broadnax out with undisclosed medical condition", "description": "TCU senior DT Broadnax isn't expected to play again because of undisclosed medical condition discovered during preseason screening", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/13/tcu-senior-broadnax-out-with-undisclosed-medical-condition/38522877/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T01:44:48Z", "content": "FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) TCU starting senior defensive tackle Joseph Broadnax isn't expected to play again because of an undisclosed medical condition initially discovered during a preseason screening.

With the game at a turning point, the 6-foot-10 forward did whatever he wanted and put Wisconsin in control.\n\nHapp followed his triple-double in Wisconsin's opener with another dominant performance Tuesday night, getting 30 points and 13 rebounds as the Badgers pulled away to a 77-68 victory over Xavier in the Gavitt Tipoff Games.\n\nWisconsin (2-0) opened the second half with an 18-4 run led by Happ , who drove inside for four baskets that set the tone. Xavier didn't get closer than six points the rest of the way, snapping its streak of 41 straight nonconference victories at the Cintas Center.\n\n\"We just knew that we were capable of hitting shots and I was capable of finishing around the rim,\" Happ said. \"A lot of that didn't go for us in the first half, but we knew if we stayed the course we'd end up on top.\"\n\nXavier (2-1) hadn't lost a nonconference game on its home court since a 56-55 defeat against Wofford on Dec. 22, 2012.\n\nIt was the third time the teams have played in the last four seasons. The Badgers upset the Musketeers 66-63 in the 2016 NCAA Tournament. Xavier won in Madison 80-70 last season.\n\nHapp was coming off the second triple-double in Wisconsin history during an 85-63 win over Coppin State \u2014 10 points, 11 rebounds, 12 assists. On Tuesday, he scored 18 in the second half as the Badgers blew open a close game .\n\n\"The key for us was to hold him down, and we did not do a great job of it,\" Xavier forward Zach Hankins said. \"We made him take a couple of tough shots, but he had a good night.\"\n\nD'Mitrik Trice added a career-high 22 points, making all five of his shots from beyond the arc.\n\nNaji Marshall had a career-high 24 points and 13 rebounds for Xavier. Point guard Quentin Goodin played his second game since returning from a left shoulder injury during practice last month and scored 13 points, favoring the arm at times.\n\nIn its opening wins over IUPUI and Evansville, Xavier blew big leads with defensive lapses. The one at the start at the second half on Tuesday led to its first loss.\n\n\"We just lost focus on the defensive end, lost our intensity,\" Marshall said. \"That's kind of been our deal since the season started. We've got to lock in and play the whole game.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWisconsin: Trice missed the last 23 games last season with a foot injury and has made a big impact in his return. He scored 21 points against Coppin State, going 5 of 9 from beyond the arc. Trice three early 3s helped the Badgers get comfortable on the road.\n\n\"He's pushing the pace when it needs to be pushed,\" coach Greg Gard said. \"Having his energy back is helping this team.\"\n\nXavier: Perimeter defense was the Musketeers' focus after they allowed Evansville to hit 17 3-pointers during their 91-85 win last Wednesday, the most 3s allowed by a Xavier team.

Wisconsin returned players that accounted for 95 percent of its points last season.

(AP) \u2014 Former Michigan State football employee Curtis Blackwell has filed a lawsuit claiming his employment agreement was violated when he was disciplined while the school addressed sexual assault allegations against three players in 2017.\n\nCoach Mark Dantonio is named as a defendant in the suit, which was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Michigan. Lou Anna Simon and Mark Hollis, the school's president and athletic director when Blackwell was there, are also defendants in the suit, along with two university police detectives. The school had no comment on the suit Tuesday night.\n\nThree Michigan State football players were accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2017. They later pleaded guilty to reduced charges . Blackwell was suspended with pay, and the school ultimately decided not to renew his contract .\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Blackwell was suspended in violation of his employment agreement, and that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by police.\n\nAfter the alleged sexual assault in January 2017, a player's father contacted Blackwell about a wild party and wanted him to ask if anyone was in trouble, according to the suit. The suit says Blackwell asked several players, including one who said he'd already spoken with Dantonio, \"who had directed him to contact the Title IX Office to report a potential sexual assault incident.\"\n\nThe suit says Blackwell, who was the team's director of college advancement and performance, did not \"conduct an investigation\" into what had happened at the party.\n\n\"He was simply 'mentoring the student athletes' by encouraging them to stay away from wild parties,\" the suit said.\n\nThe suit alleges that the defendants did not honor Blackwell's employment agreement, which the suit says required that he be allowed to speak with the athletic director before any discipline was imposed.\n\nThe suit also claims police arrested Blackwell without probable cause.\n\n\"There was no evidence that Plaintiff had interfered with a police investigation as the MSU Police Defendants had falsely alleged,\" the suit said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Aaron Lavinsky/Star Tribune via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 When Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Jerryd Bayless walked into their hotel rooms in Minnesota, they found appropriate gifts from Timberwolves All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns: winter coats.\n\nAfter the overnight temperature dropped to 7 degrees, the newest members of the team by way of the Jimmy Butler trade with Philadelphia appreciated the welcome from Minnesota's best player. Butler's awkward and drawn-out departure created an icy atmosphere around the organization, but now that the deal is finally done, the Wolves have begun trying to warm the atmosphere back up.\n\n\"We can't wait to get on the court, put on that jersey and put it on for this city,\" Covington said at a news conference inside Target Center on Tuesday afternoon that carried just a bit less buzz than Butler's open-to-the-public introduction at the Mall of America less than 17 months ago.\n\nAs Butler formally joined the 76ers , the Wolves pivoted forward after a pressure-relieving win over Brooklyn on Monday night following an 0-5 road trip.\n\nNeither Covington nor Saric played against the Nets, but they're on track to take the floor on Wednesday night against New Orleans. Bayless is injured, rehabilitating a hyperextended right knee, and with a glut of point guards on the roster he's not expected to see playing time even once he's healthy. Both Covington and Saric were starters for the Sixers, who finished third in the Eastern Conference last season at 52-30.\n\n\"They're both young, and they're going to get better. Both are very good defensively. They both shoot the 3. We think they fit well with the guys that we do have,\" said president of basketball operations and coach Tom Thibodeau. \"Once we got to that point where we felt we were getting multiple rotational players, then we felt it would be time to execute the deal. When we initially started off, that wasn't the case.\"\n\nAs for whether the Timberwolves could be better without Butler, the four-time All-Star with exceptional ability on both ends on the court, Thibodeau demurred.\n\n\"We have to focus on who's here. We think we have a good, young nucleus, and we have to build off of that,\" Thibodeau said.\n\nCovington is the centerpiece of the package.\n\nThe 27-year-old, who went undrafted out of Tennessee State and began in the NBA with Houston in the 2013-14 season, has career averages of 12.6 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game with a 35.9 shooting percentage from 3-point range. The 6-foot-9 Covington was an All-Defensive First Team pick last season with a career-most 315 deflections and a defensive rating of 99.0 that led all forwards in the league with at least 30 minutes per game. He was ninth in the NBA in steals with an average of 1.7 per game.\n\nThat's the area where he'll help the Timberwolves the most, the area that Butler was also acquired to help improve.\n\n\"In order to stay in this league and be effective, you've got to be able to go down there and be able to stop somebody on the other end,\" Covington said, adding: \"I think I watched more film the first few years than I've ever watched my entire life, as far as just different guys and watching how they read certain things and build the habits of watching players and everything. So I'd say the past couple seasons is when everything started to click.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old Saric was named to the All-Rookie First Team in 2016-17. The native of Croatia has career averages of 13.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. He shot 39.3 percent from 3-point range last season.\n\nCovington will likely fill Butler's starting spot. Thibodeau could move Taj Gibson to the second unit and keep Saric as a starter. The 6-foot-10 Saric, who was the 12th overall pick in the 2014 draft, is the classic \"stretch four\" with a power forward's size and a small forward's shot. He meshed well with Sixers center Joel Embiid, so Towns has the potential to similarly complement his game.\n\n\"KAT is shooting so much better from the 3-point line than Joel, and it seems like we can play with each other,\" Saric said, adding: \"If I find a way how to play with Joel, I think I can find a way how to play with KAT.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Ludtke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Running back Aaron Jones' breakout game led to a breakthrough performance in the red zone for the Green Bay Packers.\n\nIn Sunday's 31-12 victory over the Miami Dolphins, Jones rushed for a career-high 145 yards and two touchdowns. With Jones taking some of the pressure off quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the Packers scored four touchdowns in four possessions inside the Dolphins 20-yard line.\n\nIt was Green Bay's first perfect day with more than one red-zone possession since Week 4 of the 2017 season.\n\n\"You saw it the other night,\" Rodgers said on Tuesday. \"Running the football in the red zone has not been a high priority for us, but the abilities that he brings slashing inside can give us some opportunities to run some more of those plays in the red zone.\"\n\nTheir next test comes on Thursday night on the road against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nSituational football \u2014 red zone and third down \u2014 has been troublesome for Green Bay's offense all season. Before the Miami game, the Packers ranked sixth in total offense (406.6 yards per game), but were only 14th in scoring (24.0 points per game) because of inconsistencies on third down (17th, 39.4 percent conversion rate) and the red zone (19th, 53.9 percent touchdowns).\n\nAgainst the Dolphins, they gained 377 yards but scored 31 points, thanks in large part to their success in the red zone.\n\nThe threat of the running game gives the Packers (4-4-1) another option as they advance toward the goal line.\n\nWhile Jones scored on runs of 2 and 10 yards, Rodgers threw touchdown passes of 7 and 25 yards to receiver Davante Adams to punctuate the other two red zone possessions. Adams is tied for second in the NFL with nine touchdown receptions. Of those, a league-high eight have come in the red zone. Since the start of the 2016 season, Adams has a league-high 22 red zone touchdown receptions.\n\nThe closer to the goal line, the less space there is to operate and the more difficult it becomes to throw. Adams' edge comes from being one of the NFL's premier route runners.\n\n\"Because the window is so tight, and he can create enough separation to where he makes that window bigger,\" Rodgers said.\n\nWith the emergence of Jones, the Packers have another weapon to use in their push for a playoff spot in the crowded NFC. Jones missed the first two games of the season with a suspension, then was part of a three-man committee in the backfield before taking over as the starter.\n\nIn the three weeks since the bye, Jones has carried 41 times, Jamaal Williams has carried 14 times and Ty Montgomery was traded to the Ravens.\n\n\"The more carries you get, I feel like the better you're going to get and the more of a game flow you get in,\" Jones said.\n\nEntering Thursday, Jones and Williams both have 73 carries. Jones, however, has rushed for 494 yards (compared to 270 for Williams) on a league-best 6.8-yard average. Jones had a 67-yard run in the first quarter against Miami, the team's longest since receiver Randall Cobb had a 67-yard run in 2013.\n\nWith Jones' emergence to join Rodgers and Adams, the Packers hope they have the firepower for back-to-back road tests against Seattle and Minnesota.\n\n\"It puts the defense in a bind,\" Adams said. \"It puts them to where they've got to load up that box and it allows us to have more opportunities outside. If they keep moving the ball like that and slashing and making big plays, it's pretty tough to figure out what to defend.\"\n\nNOTES: The Packers held what coach Mike McCarthy described as a \"very limited\" practice on Tuesday before departing for Seattle in the evening. WR Randall Cobb (hamstring), CB Kevin King (hamstring), S Kentrell Brice (ankle), OLB Nick Perry (knee) were not traveling with the team, though the Packers said their game status would be updated on the final injury report on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Mark Dantonio often shies away from talking about injuries. This year, the topic is unavoidable.\n\nThe question is whether Michigan State's offensive woes can be blamed mostly on poor health \u2014 or if there are deeper problems the Spartans need to resolve.\n\n\"Obviously we're playing very well on the defensive side of the ball,\" Dantonio said Tuesday. \"We've got to get better on the offensive side of the ball, but that's where really all of our injuries have occurred.\"\n\nAfter a 26-6 loss to Ohio State last weekend, Michigan State is 13th in the Big Ten in total offense. It's been a disappointing showing for a unit that returned almost every starter from a year ago, and as the Spartans wrap up a fairly pedestrian season, Dantonio faces the tricky task of evaluating an offense that has been a weak link but is nowhere near full strength.\n\n\"This year I would say it's the injuries. It's always something; every year you're going to deal with something,\" Dantonio said. \"A lot of things are predicated in how your quarterback plays. That's college football. That's pro football. That's high school football. If your quarterback is playing well, you're going to be successful, usually.\"\n\nMichigan State (6-4) expected a lot from quarterback Brian Lewerke this year, but he has dealt with a shoulder injury and has been splitting time lately with backup Rocky Lombardi. Running back LJ Scott hurt an ankle and is now redshirting .\n\nFelton Davis was lost for the year with an Achilles tendon injury, and fellow receivers Cody White, Darrell Stewart and Jalen Nailor have missed time, too. The offensive line has also been weakened by injuries.\n\nThe problem for Michigan State \u2014 looking ahead to next year \u2014 is that it's hard to tell how much the injuries are holding the Spartans back. There's some evidence that the offense has been in decline for a while. Michigan State averaged 43 points a game and finished second in the Big Ten in total offense in 2014, but the Spartans haven't been close to that level since.\n\nIn the three seasons following that 2014 campaign, Michigan State was sixth, sixth and eighth in the league in total offense. The Spartans have dropped even further this year.\n\nMichigan State has been particularly bad on third down this season. The Spartans have converted just 30 percent of the time, one of the worst marks in the FBS.\n\n\"We just haven't been able to get the completions we needed, and we've been in some tough situations, especially some tough field position,\" tight end Matt Sokol said. \"Just comes down to execution, and all of us just coming together.\"\n\nMichigan State takes a good deal of pride in the continuity of its staff. Defensive coordinator Mike Tressel and co-offensive coordinator Dave Warner have been with the Spartans for Dantonio's whole 12-season tenure as coach.\n\nBut as the offense sputters, Warner in particular is under scrutiny. Right now, the Spartans are still hoping to win their last two regular-season games and go to the best bowl they can, but the offseason isn't far off. That's when Dantonio will show \u2014 through his words and actions \u2014 how much of Michigan State's struggles he felt could have been avoided.\n\n\"We've lost four football games. I feel like we've had a chance to win every one of those. So it's more than just about injuries that we didn't win those games,\" Dantonio said. \"It's coaching decisions, it's head coaching decisions, it's players that are playing, you know, breakdowns or the ability to execute. It's the execution of the people we're playing against, that they do a good job. So, so many things you look at there. We're going to keep getting better and keep pushing.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nIncreased Woolsey Fire activity was seen Tuesday near Lake Sherwood. (Photo courtesy of California Highway Patrol via the Ventura County Star)\n\nPARADISE, Calif. \u2013 Ernest Foss was a musician who gave lessons out of his home when he lived in San Francisco, where an amplifier that ran the length of a wall served as the family\u2019s living room couch. Carl Wiley refurbished tires for Michelin. Jesus Fernandez, known as \u201cZeus,\u201d was described as a loving father and loyal friend.\n\nThey were among the first victims identified in the aftermath of the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in California history, an inferno blamed for at least 42 deaths, with authorities ramping up the search Tuesday for still more souls.\n\nThe flames all but obliterated the Northern California town of Paradise, population 27,000, and ravaged surrounding areas last Thursday. The exact number of missing was unclear, but many friends and relatives of those living in the fire zone said they hadn\u2019t heard from loved ones. Some went to shelters looking for the missing.\n\nEfforts were underway to bring in mobile morgues, cadaver dogs, a rapid DNA analysis system for identifying victims, and an additional 150 search-and-rescue personnel on top of 13 teams already looking for remains \u2013 a grim indication that the death toll would almost surely rise.\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea\u2019s office has identified four of the victims, publicly naming three.\n\nJames Wiley said sheriff\u2019s deputies informed him that his father, Carl, was among the dead, but the younger Wiley hadn\u2019t been able to leave his property in the fire area to see for himself. The elder Wiley, 77, was a tire-recapper, and the family lived in Alaska for many years before moving to Butte County decades ago.\n\nJames Wiley said his father was a stoic veteran, and the two had not spoken in six years. \u201cHey, I lost him a long time ago,\u201d the younger man said.\n\nFoss, 63, moved to Paradise eight years ago because the high cost of living pushed him out of the San Francisco Bay Area, according to his daughter, Angela Loo. He had swollen limbs and couldn\u2019t walk. He had also been on oxygen.\n\nLoo told KTVU-TV in Oakland that her father taught music out of their home in San Francisco and turned the living room into a studio.\n\n\u201cI love that he shared his gift of music with me and so many others during his lifetime,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would want to be remembered for being a San Franciscan through and through.\u201d\n\nFernandez, a 48-year-old Concow resident, also died.\n\nMyrna Pascua, whose husband was best friends with the man known as \u201cZeus,\u201d called him a \u201ctireless provider, a dependable and loyal friend, a considerate neighbor, and loving father. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him.\u201d\n\nFive days after the blaze, over 1,000 people were at more than a half-dozen shelters set up for evacuees. At the Neighborhood Church in Chico, counselors, chaplains and nursing students from California State University, Chico, were available to help.\n\nVolunteers cooked meals, and there was a large bulletin board with information about missing people.\n\nEddie Lazarom, who fled Paradise on foot before getting a lift from a UPS truck, was among those staying at the church. He said he had yet to hear from his three grandchildren, ages 22, 24 and 28.\n\n\u201cI am really worried about them. They have common sense, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019d hate to find out later that they burned up,\u201d he said.\n\nGreg Gibson came to the shelter for information about his neighbors. He doesn\u2019t know if they tried to leave or not but says the fire exploded so quickly that if they hesitated, they would have had trouble.\n\n\u201cIt happened so fast. I would have been such an easy decision to stay, but it was the wrong choice,\u201d Gibson said.\n\nThe search for the dead was drawing on portable devices that can identify someone\u2019s genetic material in a couple of hours, rather than days or weeks.\n\n\u201cIn many circumstances, without rapid DNA technology, it\u2019s just such a lengthy process,\u201d says Frank DePaolo, a deputy commissioner of the New York City medical examiners\u2019 office, which has been at the forefront of the science of identifying human remains since 9/11 and is exploring how it might use a rapid DNA device.\n\nStill, experts said Tuesday that authorities may first try more traditional methods of identification such as examining dental records. That\u2019s in part because victims might have undergone dental X-rays but not personal DNA profiles. Medical records of bone fractures, prosthetics or implants can also be helpful.\n\nBefore the Paradise tragedy, the deadliest single fire on record in California was a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles that killed 29.\n\nAt the other end of the state, firefighters made progress against a massive blaze that has killed two people in star-studded Malibu and destroyed well over 400 structures in Southern California .\n\nThe flames roared to life again in a mountainous wilderness area Tuesday, sending up a huge plume of smoke near the community of Lake Sherwood. Still, firefighters made gains. The number of people evacuated was down by about half from the day before, to around 100,000, authorities said, and the fire was partially contained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting the upper hand here. We\u2019re feeling better,\u201d Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown said California is \u201cpretty well maxed out\u201d from fighting several deadly wildfires, and he expressed gratitude for help from surrounding states and the federal government. He said the state is doing everything possible to prevent fires, but \u201csome things only God can do.\u201d\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he canceled a trip to Asia and will visit the fire zones Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nThe fire in Northern California charred at least 195 square miles (505 square kilometers), but officials said crews were able to keep it from advancing toward Oroville, a town of about 19,000 people.\n\nThe state recently completed a $1.1 billion reconstruction project at the Oroville Dam \u2013 the nation\u2019s tallest at 770 feet (235 meters) \u2013 and officials worried about damage if flames came through. Spillways at the dam crumbled during heavy rains in 2017, prompting thousands to flee for fear of a catastrophic release of water.\n\nThe cause of the fires remained under investigation, but they broke out around the time and place two utilities reported equipment trouble. Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, who takes office in January, sidestepped questions about what action should be taken against utilities if their power lines are found to be responsible.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/13/search-victims-and-missing-california-wildfire-continues/1995025002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Cydney Henderson, USA TODAY", "title": "See the cast of 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' at the UK Premiere", "description": "The cast of \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" gather to celebrate the upcoming release of the latest film in the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/life/movies/2018/11/14/uk-premiere-fantastic-beasts-crimes-grindelwald/1994566002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/13/USAT/37bc6690-08be-4cf6-9f5a-00ef71f9d7f5-1061215016.JPG?crop=1993,1140,x0,y89&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:35:37Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nThe cast of \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" gather at Britain's Cineworld Leicester Square to celebrate the upcoming release of the latest film in the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.

USA TODAY\n\nWest Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen looks at the scoreboard during the third quarter against Texas. (Photo: Bethany Hocker, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWest Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen doesn\u2019t watch the \u201creality TV,\u201d as he puts it, that is the weekly College Football Playoff rankings: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do me any good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do our players any good.\"\n\n\u201cIt does coaches no good to think about it and talk about it,\u201d Holgorsen told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cI really, honestly don\u2019t (watch). I get why that show is, it\u2019s all advertising and all that stuff. Fans want to watch it and it\u2019s been great for college football. You guys want to follow it and write about it and read about it and talk scenarios and all that good stuff. It\u2019s the most popular thing going.\"\n\nNot to say that Holgorsen is unaware of the Mountaineers\u2019 climb up the rankings. Ranked No. 13 in the first release of the 2018 season, West Virginia moved to No. 9 last week \u2014 climbing on the back of a 42-41 win at No. 15 Texas. The Mountaineers held that spot Tuesday after Saturday's 47-10 win against TCU.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress,\u201d he said.\n\nNow 8-1 overall, with that one loss coming at No. 16 Iowa State, this year\u2019s surge has the Mountaineers alongside Big 12 rival Oklahoma and a handful of fellow contenders from the Power Five leagues as the teams ready to pounce if given a window to slip into the top four.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time West Virginia has played a national role under Holgorsen, the Mountaineers\u2019 head coach since 2011, but this season marks something new: WVU entering the heart of November as a realistic challenger for a national semifinal, not as a team on the outskirts of a New Year\u2019s Six bowl and playing the role of spoiler for opponents ranked higher by the selection committee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been knocking on the door a little bit, as we are this year, which is all we\u2019re at right now \u2014 we\u2019re just in the conversation,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the conversation a couple other years and couldn\u2019t get it done, you know. \u201c\n\nThis year\u2019s team is the culmination of a shift in style and approach, changes the Mountaineers embraced amid a run of middling success from 2014-16 that have come to define the program in Holgorsen\u2019s eighth season. While still rooted in Air Raid principles, the offense has forged a commitment to the running game even as senior quarterback Will Grier puts together a season worthy of Heisman Trophy consideration. WVU enters Saturday\u2019s matchup with Oklahoma State ranked third in the Big 12 in yards per carry and sixth nationally in yards per play.\n\nHolgorsen has also changed the Mountaineers\u2019 practice habits and routine; drills now mirror how teams operate in the NFL, he said. Both changes, in how the team attacks on offense and in its practice habits, have been \u201ca big help for our defense,\u201d said Holgorsen. WVU ranks 43rd nationally in yards allowed per play, nearly a full yard better than a unit that ranked 98th in the same category a season ago.\n\nIn recruiting, the Mountaineers have gone from emphasizing Texas to sticking closer to home, in West Virginia and the nearby corners of Ohio and Pennsylvania. To this mix Holgorsen has added a heavy dose of transfers \u2014 players from junior colleges, graduate transfers and additions from fellow programs on the Football Bowl Subdivision level, such as Grier from Florida. The success rate with these transfers is around 50 percent, Holgorsen estimated.\n\n\u201cWe weathered the storm and made some adjustments in terms of how we were recruiting and how we were playing football, how we were practicing,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew we had a lot of work to do because we weren\u2019t where we needed to be in order to compete. There\u2019s a lot of things that needed to change. It\u2019s been fun to watch it change, and it\u2019s change the way it needs to.\u201d\n\nWith at least two and as many three games left in its regular season, new-look West Virginia\u2019s path to the playoff now goes through Oklahoma \u2014 first in the season finale, a home game on Nov. 23, and perhaps again a week later, should the two meet again to decide the Big 12 championship. WVU has yet to defeat the Sooners in six tries since joining the conference, with just one meeting decided by a single possession.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mountaineers will be keeping tabs on the scoreboard. Notre Dame losing to either Syracuse or Southern California would open up a spot in the top four. Another scenario deals with the Big Ten, and finds the winner of the Michigan and Ohio State matchup losing once more before the postseason, potentially to Northwestern in the conference title game.\n\nIn the playoff era, at least, this is uncharted territory: WVU might need help to crack the top four, but the Mountaineers have played themselves into position to become just the second Big 12 team to reach a semifinal, joining the Sooners. Not that they\u2019re paying attention to the standings.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point now where we have a chance.,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cWe just gotta keep blocking things out and keep the same approach that we\u2019ve had.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame and Michigan hold steady in CFP", "description": "The College Football Playoff rankings held steady at the top, with Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame and Michigan an unchanged first four from last week", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/13/alabama-clemson-notre-dame-and-michigan-hold-steady-in-cfp/38522431/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c138cef0fc36badccb3adfeb61757fac2772c358/c=0-220-4465-2732/local/-/media/2018/11/13/USATODAY/usatsports/e5c404518d6a4f468d3ef188b0ea6d49.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:27:46Z", "content": "Alabama running back Josh Jacobs (8) carries the ball during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Mississippi State, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Tuscaloosa, Ala.

In fact, the selection committee's entire top 10 stayed the same, the first time that has happened in the five seasons since the CFP was born.\n\nWith three weekends left until the final selections are made on Dec. 2, Georgia was fifth and Oklahoma was sixth. LSU, Washington State, West Virginia and Ohio State rounded out the top 10.\n\nUCF moved up one spot to No. 11 and remained the highest-ranked team from outside the Power Five conferences. The Knights on Saturday play Cincinnati, which is ranked or the first time by the selection committee this season at No. 24.\n\nDON'T COUNT ON STABILITY\n\nIn the four-year history of the College Football Playoff, the four teams at the top of the rankings after three weeks have never all made it to the semifinals. As much as it might feel as if the field is well set, it would be best to expect an unexpected result or two over the next three weeks.\n\nThree not-so-outlandish upsets that could create confusion for the selection committee:\n\n1. Alabama loses the SEC championship game to Georgia.\n\nThis could lead to the most controversial call in CFP history. The Crimson Tide is the defending national champion and Tua Tagovailoa and Co. have been stomping everyone in their path. The Tide is not losing this week to The Citadel. The chances are slim Auburn beats 'Bama at home. But even if that were to happen, Alabama could quickly redeem itself by beating Georgia to win the SEC on championship weekend. A 12-1 SEC champion Alabama is not getting left out of the playoff, nor should it under any available circumstances this season.\n\nBut 12-1 without an SEC championship? The committee has already twice sent teams that did not reach their conference title games to the playoff. Last year it was Alabama and the year before, Ohio State got there.\n\nIn Ohio State's case, the body-of-work argument was strong enough to overcome being bumped from the Big Ten title chase by Penn State, a team the Buckeyes had lost to in a close game at Happy Valley. Last year, Alabama seemed like a default pick at 11-1 over Ohio State and USC. Both were 11-2 with conference titles, but ugly losses on their ledgers.\n\nCould the committee squeeze in the Tide after a loss to Georgia, which would obviously get in, if Clemson, Notre Dame and Michigan (and maybe even Oklahoma) all won out? It's not as if Alabama would have a loaded resume, with victories against LSU, Mississippi State and Auburn at the top. But there is also little doubt Alabama would be favored on a neutral field against any team in the country.\n\nThe committee has to be rooting for the Tide to keep it out of this mess.\n\n2. Ohio State beats Michigan and wins the Big Ten.\n\nBig 12 fans will disagree, but Michigan at 12-1 looks like a good bet to sail into the playoff \u2014 especially if Notre Dame finishes unbeaten, therefore making the Wolverines' only loss a one-score game in the opener at South Bend. The Buckeyes have nice road victories against Penn State and Michigan State. Add Michigan and Northwestern in the Big Ten championship game to that resume, and suddenly a season of struggles in Columbus, Ohio, won't look so bad at all. The stain of that blowout loss at Purdue won't come off easy, though, and choosing between Ohio State at 12-1 and Oklahoma at 12-1 or West Virginia at 11-1 or Washington State at 12-1 won't be such an easy chore for the committee.\n\n3. Notre Dame loses, especially to Southern California.\n\nAny loss for the Irish looks problematic if the rest of the contenders win out. Michigan could help Notre Dame by finishing 12-1. The Irish could make the case the committee can't put the Wolverines in and leave out the one team that beat them. Don't let anyone tell you the Irish are out with one loss. That's shortsighted and doesn't take into account that Big 12 contenders Oklahoma and West Virginia and Washington State could easily pick up a second loss before they even reach their conference title games.\n\nStill, the Irish at 11-1 pits them against any other once-beaten conference champion, while also possibly forcing the committee to justify putting Michigan in and leaving the Irish out. And if Notre Dame's loss is to USC, it could put a spotlight on Washington State's poorly officiated loss to the Trojans back in September by virtue of comparing common opponents.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

The Crimson Tide is the defending national champion and Tua Tagovailoa and Co. have been stomping everyone in their path. The Tide is not losing this week to The Citadel. The chances are slim Auburn beats 'Bama at home. But even if that were to happen, Alabama could quickly redeem itself by beating Georgia to win the SEC on championship weekend. A 12-1 SEC champion Alabama is not getting left out of the playoff, nor should it under any available circumstances this season.\n\nBut 12-1 without an SEC championship? The committee has already twice sent teams that did not reach their conference title games to the playoff. Last year it was Alabama and the year before, Ohio State got there.\n\nIn Ohio State's case, the body-of-work argument was strong enough to overcome being bumped from the Big Ten title chase by Penn State, a team the Buckeyes had lost to in a close game at Happy Valley. Last year, Alabama seemed like a default pick at 11-1 over Ohio State and USC. Both were 11-2 with conference titles, but ugly losses on their ledgers.\n\nCould the committee squeeze in the Tide after a loss to Georgia, which would obviously get in, if Clemson, Notre Dame and Michigan (and maybe even Oklahoma) all won out? It's not as if Alabama would have a loaded resume, with victories against LSU, Mississippi State and Auburn at the top. But there is also little doubt Alabama would be favored on a neutral field against any team in the country.\n\nThe committee has to be rooting for the Tide to keep it out of this mess.\n\n2. Ohio State beats Michigan and wins the Big Ten.\n\nBig 12 fans will disagree, but Michigan at 12-1 looks like a good bet to sail into the playoff \u2014 especially if Notre Dame finishes unbeaten, therefore making the Wolverines' only loss a one-score game in the opener at South Bend. The Buckeyes have nice road victories against Penn State and Michigan State. Add Michigan and Northwestern in the Big Ten championship game to that resume, and suddenly a season of struggles in Columbus, Ohio, won't look so bad at all. The stain of that blowout loss at Purdue won't come off easy, though, and choosing between Ohio State at 12-1 and Oklahoma at 12-1 or West Virginia at 11-1 or Washington State at 12-1 won't be such an easy chore for the committee.\n\n3. Notre Dame loses, especially to Southern California.\n\nAny loss for the Irish looks problematic if the rest of the contenders win out. Michigan could help Notre Dame by finishing 12-1. The Irish could make the case the committee can't put the Wolverines in and leave out the one team that beat them. Don't let anyone tell you the Irish are out with one loss. That's shortsighted and doesn't take into account that Big 12 contenders Oklahoma and West Virginia and Washington State could easily pick up a second loss before they even reach their conference title games.\n\nStill, the Irish at 11-1 pits them against any other once-beaten conference champion, while also possibly forcing the committee to justify putting Michigan in and leaving the Irish out. And if Notre Dame's loss is to USC, it could put a spotlight on Washington State's poorly officiated loss to the Trojans back in September by virtue of comparing common opponents.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

Anderson, who was a 1,000-yard rusher in 2017 for the Denver Broncos. (AP Photo/Nell Redmond, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Panthers coach Ron Rivera said C.J. Anderson's frustration with his smaller-than-expected role on offense contributed to the team's decision to release the former 1,000-yard rusher midway through the season.\n\nRivera said he spoke recently to Anderson and could sense the veteran running back's frustration over not being more involved in Carolina's offense.\n\nChristian McCaffrey is the team's starter and rarely leaves the field, playing in 96 percent of his team's offensive snaps \u2014 by far the most of any running back in the league.\n\nMost of Anderson's reps have come in a shared backfield set with McCaffrey the Panthers called \"Pony 21.\" Anderson has carried the ball just 24 times and caught one pass this season. The limited role came just one season after Anderson ran for 1,007 yards for the Broncos.\n\n\"He's a veteran guy who has had a lot of success in this league and was just looking for more opportunities,\" Rivera said Tuesday, one day after the Panthers released Anderson. \"You could feel\" the frustration.\n\nRivera reiterated what general manager Marty Hurney said Monday \u2014 that Anderson did not ask to be released from the Panthers (6-3), who visit the Lions on Sunday after a 52-21 shellacking at the hands of the Steelers last week.\n\nAnderson tweeted Monday: \"No love lost. Thank you Carolina. Grind time.\"\n\nRivera said Cameron Artis-Payne will take over Anderson's role as the No. 2 back in Carolina.\n\nArtis-Payne was a fifth-round pick in 2015, but has played in just 25 games and carried the ball only 99 times during his career for 422 yards with four touchdowns.\n\nRivera believes Artis-Payne, who has only been active for two games this season, has a similar skillset to Anderson and can also come in and spell McCaffrey during games. Carolina also signed veteran running back Travaris Cadet, a player Rivera views as similar in style to McCaffrey as a backup plan.\n\nRivera called Artis-Payne \"a tough, hard-nosed young man\" who has gone about his role the right way in practice despite not seeing much playing time.\n\n\"He's waited for his opportunity and earned this opportunity, and hopefully when he gets his chance on the football field he will take advantage of it,\" Rivera said.\n\nRivera said the Panthers offense evolved this year under first-year offensive coordinator Norv Turner, and that things began to focus around McCaffrey as the primary, if not exclusive, back on offense \u2014 similar to how Turner extensively used LaDainian Tomlinson when he coached the San Diego Chargers.\n\nMcCaffrey's expanded role isn't a huge surprise.\n\nRivera said before the season that getting the second-year back 25 to 30 touches per game would be \"ideal,\" although few could have imagined that he'd leave the field as infrequently as he has this season.\n\n\"The more Norv got to know who Christian is, the more we saw we could keep him on the field,\" Rivera said. \"A lot of things that we can do are structured around his skillset.\"\n\nMcCaffrey leads the Panthers with 579 yards rushing, followed by Cam Newton with 352 yards and wide receiver D.J. Moore with 122.\n\nAnderson, who had been expected to be used as a short-yardage back, had 104 yards rushing and no touchdowns on the ground in nine games. His lone reception went for a 24-yard touchdown.\n\nMcCaffrey said Anderson's release was a reminder the game is a business.\n\n\"Our coaches have a lot of confidence in the guys that are here right now and they had to make a decision they felt was best for the team,\" McCaffrey said. \"As far as we are concerned we have to focus on the guys here and wish him the very best. Our guys right now are just locked into us.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Sooners got a scare from Oklahoma State, but did not fall from No. 6.\n\nLSU, Washington State, West Virginia and Ohio State came next, meaning the top 10 spots all remained unchanged for the first time since the committee started unveiling its rankings in the 2014 season.\n\nCentral Florida, the other unbeaten in the Bowl Classification, moved up one spot to No. 11.

There are a couple potential hiccups to that scenario. The Crimson Tide have one ranked opponent left, Georgia in the SEC title game. Notre Dame faces No. 12 Syracuse on Saturday at Yankee Stadium. Clemson does not have a ranked team left on its schedule, but rival South Carolina and the ACC championship game still loom.\n\nMichigan remains best positioned to win out and make secure the fourth spot. The Wolverines will host Indiana and then travel to Ohio State. Two wins would set up a meeting in the Big Ten title game with Northwestern.\n\nGeorgia would likely be in if the Bulldogs can beat Alabama on Dec. 1. That would create some debate between potential one-loss champions from the Big Ten or Big 12 and the Crimson Tide.\n\nThe top four teams in final rankings on Dec. 2 will play in the semifinals.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 After five straight weeks of preparing and coming up empty, the New York Giants have something to smile about starting off a week.\n\nIt's amazing what a win can do for a team.\n\n\"Anytime you win, it kind of verifies that what you're doing is right,\" coach Pat Shurmur said Tuesday, less than 24 hours after the Giants (2-7) rallied late to snap a five-game losing streak with a 27-23 win over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\"The reason we all started playing and coaching football is because we love the competition, we love the physical nature of the game, and we love the process of getting ready to play the next opponent,\" Shurmur added.\n\n\"Then on game day, you put all your energy into winning, all your energy into putting a winning performance on the field, and so I sensed real joy in the locker room yesterday \u2014 a bunch of guys that put a lot into it, and we were able to overcome some adversity and win a football game.\"\n\nThe goal now for the Giants is to try to put a couple of wins together. They haven't done that since December 2016. They have a 5-20 record in their past 25 games.\n\nThe difference Monday night against the 49ers was the Giants made plays. Eli Manning threw three touchdowns and engineered a late drive capped by a short touchdown pass to Sterling Shepard.\n\nThe offensive line, aided by the addition of newcomer Jamon Brown at right guard, allowed only one sack and the defense got two interceptions from linebacker B.J. Goodson.\n\nSpecial teams also contributed as Aldrick Rosas kicked two field goals and Corey Coleman had three kickoff returns for 92 yards.\n\nThe performance by Manning was excellent. There have been many calling for the 37-year-old to be benched with the team losing again. The two-time Super Bowl MVP answered the critics.\n\n\"Any time a player puts a winning performance on the field, he should feel good about it at least for a day or so,\" Shurmur said. \"The challenge is to then prepare to do it again in a week, so I don't know. That's a question for him, but he had a winning performance, he helped us win a game, and he should feel good about that. Now we just have to build on that going into Tampa.\"\n\nThe Giants will play host to the Buccaneers in their bid for their first win of the season at home (0-4).\n\nWhile the Giants' chances of making the playoffs remain dim, Shurmur likes the team that has been assembled in his first season.\n\n\"This is a really good locker room \u2014 we're young, we're new, but these guys believe in each other and try to play the game for each other,\" he said. \"I don't know if they were loose, I don't know if that's the right term, but I thought they were just out there playing hard and having fun playing football.\"\n\nNOTES: Shurmur said the Giants had the usual wear and tear in the game, but he expects no one to miss Sunday. ... Brown played very well considering he had been with the team only a week. ... Shurmur also said rookie linebacker Lorenzo Carter had his best game in both the pass rush and coverage. ... Saquon Barkley had 20 carries for 67 yards and caught four passes for 33 yards. It was the eighth time in nine games Barkley had at least 100 scrimmage yards. \"If we're just going to talk about Saquon and his involvement in the game, whether we hand it to him or throw it to him, it really doesn't matter. You'd like to see your back touch the ball or run the ball close to 20 times,\" Shurmur said\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

More than 2,000 more have received temporary visas to stay in the country.\n\nMore: The migrant caravan has arrived. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe state government of Jalisco organized buses to take the migrants to the next state to the north, Nayarit, where they expected to have other buses waiting for them to continue the trek north, according to a statement from Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a migrant advocacy group traveling with the caravan. But the buses dropped off the migrants 55 miles away from Nayarit, leaving the migrants stranded.\n\n\"This is a clear decision by the Jalisco state government to get us out of Guadalajara,\" Pueblo Sin Fronteras said in a statement. \"It puts at risk the physical integrity, security and health of thousands of families with children, who are being left in the darkness of the early morning.\"\n\nCLOSE Migrant caravans winding their way toward the U.S. are reigniting rhetoric and arguments about immigration and border security. And it's not the first time. USA TODAY\n\nMigrants halfway to border\n\nDespite the new round of difficulties, Guadalajara marked the halfway milestone for the caravan, which set out Oct. 12 from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and has traveled roughly 1,400 miles. The caravan inched through Central America and southern Mexico, enduring brutal heat, torrential downpours and logistical complications.\n\nThe pace has accelerated as the group enters northern Mexico, sometimes traveling more than 100 miles a day, where temperatures are chillier than the subtropical south of the country. The capital city of Mexico City hosted the caravan for almost a week in a sports stadium at a cost of nearly $600,000, according to interim mayor Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Avieva.\n\nBut some impatient with the slow, steady pace started splintering off.\n\nThe first couple of waves arrived in Tijuana on Tuesday. Another small group is risking the cartel-controlled territory of eastern Mexico to reach Texas, according to officials at a migrant shelter in Saltillo, about 190 miles south of Laredo, Texas.\n\n\"People need to see that they keep on moving or walking,\" said Rodrigo Abeja, project coordinator with Pueblo Sin Fronteras. \"They get desperate when staying put.\"\n\nThe groups going it alone appear to be receiving support from Mexican officials. They are sleeping in shelters prepared by state and local governments, and being monitored, but not stopped, by immigration agents and police officers. In some cases, local governments are even providing bus rides, which happened Monday in the coastal state of Sinaloa, where some 400 migrants were given rides up the coast, according to local media.\n\nMexico issues 2,700 temporary visa\n\nOthers have been able to beg for funds or receive money from relatives for bus rides to the border, Abeja said. He added that federal officers were slowing traffic, which allowed caravan participants to hitch rides aboard everything from tractor trailers to agricultural vehicles.\n\nThe Mexican government has also offered refuge, asylum or work visas to caravan participants. The government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. Another 533 migrants have requested a voluntary return to their countries, the government reported.\n\nPolls show Mexicans offering tepid support for the caravan. But other issues, led by the pending presidential transition on Dec. 1, have made more headlines.\n\nA Consulta Mitofsky survey found 51.4 percent of respondents said Mexico should \u201chelp and protect\u201d the caravan, while 33.8 percent said the government should \u201cnot help and pressure to return them to their countries.\u201d Rural residents were more inclined to support the caravan crossing Mexico than urban dwellers, according to the survey.\n\nLess than one percent of Mexico\u2019s population is foreign-born, said Javier Urbano, a professor at the Iberoamerican University, who studies immigration. But with many Central Americans staying rather than transiting the country, the immigration debate \"is just beginning.\"\n\nCLOSE Drone footage shows from above some of the several thousand Central Americans, mostly Hondurans, that have been trekking in a caravan through southern Mexico with hopes of reaching the United States. (Nov. 2) AP\n\nNew caravans headed north\n\nAs the main caravan and its splinter groups have moved north, more caravans are close behind with at least two winding their way north.\n\nMigrants in a second caravan started arriving in Mexico City on Tuesday, picking over bundles of warm clothes as the temperature was set to fall into the low 40s. Few expressed haste to hit the road, having traveled the same grueling path as the original caravan.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s been slow, but that\u2019s because there are so many women and children,\" said Omar Cruz, 27, a painter from Honduras, who was fleeing gang violence at home and in no rush to reach the border. \"The border's not going anywhere.\"\n\n\n\nLike so many other caravan members walking ahead and behind him, Cruz wasn't dissuaded by the stories of the U.S. government attempting to impede asylum applications.\n\n\n\n\"The law lets a person apply for asylum,\" Cruz said. \"If you're patient and have faith in God, you can make it happen.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/13/migrant-caravan-some-border-most-mexico-far-us/1992059002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Warriors suspend fiery Draymond Green 1 game for conduct", "description": "Warriors All-Star forward Draymond Green has been suspended one game by Golden State for conduct detrimental to the team", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/11/13/warriors-suspend-fiery-draymond-green-1-game-for-conduct/38522311/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/045e8ca9d156038f61b0cb8b59774433ae213560/c=0-188-4038-2459/local/-/media/2018/11/13/USATODAY/usatsports/1a4457bca34747aa832a4283a126c29c.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:06:17Z", "content": "Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant, right, reacts as he fouls out of the game while forward Draymond Green, left, and guard Andre Iguodala look on during the overtime portion of an NBA basketball game against the Los Angeles Clippers Monday, Nov. 12, \u2026 [+1434 chars]", "fulltext": "Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr speaks at a news conference before an NBA basketball game between the Warriors and the Atlanta Hawks in Oakland, Calif., Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Golden State Warriors don't expect Draymond Green's latest dustup with Kevin Durant to become a long-term issue for the two-time defending NBA champions.\n\nNor do they expect the emotional Green to change after his one-game suspension by the team Tuesday.\n\nDurant said he expects to work things out with Green, saying, \"I'm sure it will, we've got a long season ahead.\"\n\n\"His presence has been a part of this team for a while, even before I got here he'd been a huge staple in this organization,\" Durant said. \"Obviously it's definitely weird not having him around and everything that went down. But that's what happens, (stuff) happens in the NBA.\"\n\nGreen was suspended one game without pay for conduct detrimental to the team following an altercation a night earlier with Durant, though general manager Bob Myers declined to offer specifics on the All-Star forward's behavior that was considered going too far. Myers and Steve Kerr collaborated on the decision.\n\n\"We just felt like this rose to the level of acting the way we did,\" Myers said, noting of Green: \"He was professional. He loves to play basketball, which is all you can ask of him.\"\n\nThe Warriors made the announcement about four hours before they were set to host Atlanta, and the 28-year-old Green was serving the suspension as his teammates beat the Hawks 110-103. He wasn't at Oracle Arena and didn't immediately respond to a text message seeking comment.\n\n\"I think we'll be fine,\" Kerr said. \"We're a team that goes through stuff, just like everybody else. And things happen, bumps in the road. You've got to move forward. It's all part of coaching a team, it's all part of being on a team. You have to get through the adversity and there are some difficult times and you just get through them.\"\n\nIn the closing seconds of regulation during Monday's 121-116 overtime loss on the road to the Clippers, Green secured a rebound and, with Durant calling for the ball, instead dribbled the length of the court into traffic and lost control as the Warriors failed to get a shot off. Durant was shown on camera visibly upset immediately afterward.\n\nThen, back on the bench waiting for the extra period to begin, the two traded words and gestured with Klay Thompson seated between them and Andre Iguodala, DeMarcus Cousins and others trying to calm the situation.\n\nDurant wouldn't get into the specifics of what was said.\n\n\"I'm going to keep that in house, that's what we do here. I'm not trying to give nobody no headlines,\" Durant said. \"What happened, happened. We're trying to move on, we're just trying to play basketball.\"\n\nFor everyone who figures this franchise is perfect, Myers quickly cleared up that notion.\n\n\"It's hard to win a championship. You can't allow anything else in your locker room, in the narrative. This team has done a good job of that,\" Myers said. \"I know it may appear as if it's looked easy over the last however many years. It's not. If you're in our locker room, if you're in our organization, it's hard.\n\n\"And so they'll get through it, and we'll keep moving. Hopefully we get to the finals and win a championship. That's all anybody's thinking about, because I think that's all you can think about. That's something that we're going to keep doing. This team has proven that they will do that and continue to do that and have done that.\"\n\nMyers and Kerr have long supported Green's fiery nature that leads to technical fouls. Myers even sat with Green next door to Oracle Arena at the Oakland Coliseum when Green was suspended for a crucial Game 5 loss to LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals. The Warriors wound up losing in seven.\n\nGreen apologized after yelling at Kerr during halftime of a game at Oklahoma City in February 2016.\n\n\"My feeling on Draymond and his impact on our team doesn't change. These things happen sometimes over the course of an NBA season,\" Kerr said. \"We deal with it \u2014 again, internally \u2014 so any conversations that are happening or have happened it's our business.\"\n\nThis wasn't the first verbal altercation between Durant, the two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP, and Green. In another overtime loss, 109-106 at Sacramento on Feb. 4, 2017, they shouted at each other and argued near the bench.\n\n\"How you handle things after they happen is the most important thing,\" Myers said.\n\nKerr said he spoke to Green, who was part of the recruiting group that worked to sway Durant to the Bay Area from Oklahoma City before the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"They've won championships together, they've been teammates, now this is the third season, they were teammates on the Olympic team,\" Kerr said. \"Draw your own conclusions.\"\n\nGreen has been off to a strong start this season for the two-time defending NBA champions, averaging 7.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.4 assists. Kerr has credited him for taking great care of the ball and establishing a tempo on both ends of the floor.\n\nThe game at Los Angeles marked Green's return from a two-game absence with a sprained right foot and toe.\n\n\"Draymond is always going to be who he is. He's a powerful force,\" Kerr said. \"He's a huge reason why we've had so much success here.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

President Donald Trump ended up calling Acosta a \"rude, terrible person\" after Acosta repeatedly tried to ask a question about the Russia investigation.\n\nThe White House revoked his credentials after the back and forth, with officials claiming Acosta placed his hands on an intern who attempted to take the microphone from him.\n\n\"The wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process,\" CNN said in a statement posted to its website.\n\nTweet o' the day\n\nDave Levinthal, reporter for The Center for Public Integrity (Photo: Hayes, Christal)\n\n\"If a Democratic House and Republican Senate could come together and solve just one problem during the next two years \u2014 spam calls to cell phones \u2014 their approval rating would jump double digits on this alone.\" - The Center for Public Integrity's Dave Levinthal, on a call for bipartisanship in a divided Congress to fix a problem every American hates.\n\nMidterms elections still undecided\n\nFlorida Republican Gov.

Bill Nelson has filed a federal lawsuit to extend the unevenly conducted statewide recount of his re-election race against GOP Gov. Rick Scott. The recount is supposed to end on Thursday. And in Georgia, where Democrat Stacey Abrams has refused to concede to Republican Brian Kemp, a federal judge has ordered state election officials to review all provisional ballots cast in the midterm elections and prohibited the state from certifying the election before Friday. And another judge ruled that absentee ballots that have been rejected because there were problems with the date of birth must be counted.\n\nHere's the latest on the controversy and the races where a winner hasn't been called.\n\nElsewhere in politics\n\nThanks for reading\n\nThis kangaroo thanks you too!\n\nHop on.
