You don\u2019t recognize the number on the screen, but the call appears to be coming from your area code \u2013 perhaps even your exchange. Maybe the display shows it\u2019s coming from your town.\n\nSo you answer \u2013 and the unwanted recorded message begins.\n\nA voice wants to sell you an extended warranty for your car, or a timeshare in a vacation spot, a loan to refinance your home.\n\nIt might even be a Chinese-language message about a purported package awaiting pickup at the local consulate.\n\nConsumers, rejoice: An attack plan is nearing deployment against the billions of illegal robocalls that have made telephones and smartphones virtual weapons of mass frustration.\n\nEmerging from a years-long effort by government, telecommunications and computer experts, the plan will use a verification system to stop robocall companies from masking the true numbers of those billions of unwanted and illegal calls.\n\nThe tactic, known as spoofing, fools consumers by causing their Caller-ID systems to indicate falsely that the robocalls come from the phone numbers of familiar businesses, organizations, friends or acquaintances.\n\nThe verification system targets a problem that's a top priority for the Federal Communication Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThe FTC last year identified robocalling as the No. 1 consumer complaint category: More than 1.9 million complaints against the practice were filed during the first five months of 2017.\n\nU.S. consumers and businesses were barraged with roughly 30.5 billion robocalls in 2017, according to YouMail, a company that provides a service to block such messages. That broke the record of 29.3 billion calls set just a year earlier. And the company estimates the 2018 total will jump to roughly 48 billion.\n\nThe pace hasn't slackened. U.S. phones received some 6.1 million robocalls per hour in September 2018 alone, YouMail reported.\n\nMany robocalls aren't just annoying \u2013 they're illegal. Robocallers are not permitted to send telemarketing messages that haven't been approved by the recipients, or to dial numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry.\n\nOne robocall executive who has been sued by the FTC acknowledged that the growing torrent poses a problem.\n\n\"Obviously, the underlying issue is the calls are illegal,\" Aaron Michael Jones, affiliated with several robocalling companies, told an FTC investigative hearing in 2015. \"We know that already.\"\n\nSome robocalls are permissible. Government regulators have carved out exemptions for charities, for example, and also for political campaigns.\n\nMajor U.S. telephone service providers are expected to start integrating the verification system with their networks in upcoming months, with a more complete ramp-up to follow in 2019.\n\nThere's no agreement yet on what consumers will see in their Caller ID systems \u2013 a green check mark, perhaps, or another symbol to indicate the caller has the authorization to use the number that's displayed.\n\nParticipants in the anti-spoofing effort predict it will produce a progressive drop in robocalls. \"It will be an ongoing battle that will gradually get better,\" said Jim McEachern, principal technologist for the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions.\n\nHe likened it to the effort that turned email spam from a similar aggravation into a relatively manageable problem.\n\nConsumer advocates say the effort represents a good first step \u2013 but call for stronger safeguards.\n\nMargot Saunders is senior counsel for the National Consumer Law Center. The verification system sounds promising, she said. But it's \"just one piece of the overall robocall puzzle.\"\n\nMcEachern says he's seen a demand for solutions.\n\n\"The vast majority of my career, when I told people what I do, their eyes would glaze over,\" McEachern said. \"Now, when I tell them what I'm doing, their eyes light up.\"\n\nSTIR and SHAKEN\n\nThe verification system is designed to correct an unforeseen problem that developed roughly two decades ago.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, the telecommunications industry launched a technology capable of transmitting telephone voice calls via a broadband Internet connection instead of a regular phone line.\n\nOne of the support services to grow out of the technology was Voice Over Internet Protocol. Robocalls use VoIP because it's inexpensive. It also enables users to enter anything imaginable as the source of the call.\n\nThat identification, true or false, automatically is conveyed to consumers.\n\nJon Peterson is an expert in internet and telephone operational protocols with Neustar, an information services provider with expertise in identity resolution. He has worked on the new verification system.\n\n\"You get email all the time from people who are not what it says in the header field,\" Peterson said. \"You can kind of think of what we've developed as the next generation of Caller ID.\"\n\nThe developers have dubbed the system STIR and SHAKEN, a geeky engineering homage to fictional British spy James Bond's martini preference.\n\nSTIR, or Secure Telephone Identity Revisited, is a call-certifying protocol. SHAKEN, or Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs, verifies the caller's right to use their phone numbers.\n\nWhen you make a call, your phone carrier will use your identifying number to create a digital signature, or token, that will accompany the call as it is being completed.\n\nAt the other end, the system verifies that nothing was tampered with and ensures that the call came from \"someone who has a legitimate right to use that number,\" McEachern said.\n\nHowever, the attack plan is no silver bullet solution.\n\nIt won't block any phone calls \u2013 including robocalls. Consumers eventually are expected to see an as yet undetermined signal that will indicate calls that have been verified, a feature intended to help guide decisions about whether or not to pick up.\n\nThe system also is expected to aid the work of companies that provide call-blocking apps for consumers. They already try to block robocalls by looking for calling patterns to identify calls from suspicious numbers.\n\nThe Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions on Thursday issued a request for proposals to get an administrator to apply and enforce the STIR and SHAKEN rules.\n\n\"Everything we're doing today is just going to be infinitely stronger once spoofing is eliminated,\" said Jonathan Nelson, a member of the research team and the director of project management for Hiya, an app company that provides Caller ID and spam protection services.\n\nThe room where it happened\n\nA team of telecom experts began discussing technological approaches to combating robocalls in 2013with little notice from the outside world. The team included representatives of the giant traditional U.S. telephone providers, such as Verizon and At&T, and of cable and other companies that now offer phone services, such as Comcast.\n\nAs public outcry over robocalls mounted, a turning point in the team's planning came during a September 2015 workshop at the Federal Communication Commission's Washington headquarters.\n\nThe session included several experts working on the verification system, along with others from the telecom industry and public and private sectors.\n\nNeustar's Peterson and Chris Wendt, Comcast Cable's director of internet protocol communications services, recommended combining the STIR protocol started in 2013 by an international standards organization with the SHAKEN implementation system the team had started work on weeks before the FCC workshop. Other team members agreed.\n\nWendt said the consensus emerged from a collegial debate over technology: \"I think this will work,\" he said, and team members agreed. \"We have a plan to go forward.\"\n\nNonetheless, team members realized they needed the entire telecom industry, working together, to make the plan a working reality.\n\n\u201cEach provider is only as good as the other in the industry in stopping illegal robocalls. We need to get buy-in and help from big and small providers to fix this,\" said Martin Dolly, AT&T's lead member of technical staff and a main figure in the anti-robocall effort.\n\nThe fears evaporated in July 2016 when the FCC spurred the creation of a robocall task force and directed major traditional and wireless phone providers to provide free call-blocking services to customers.\n\n\"That changed, in many ways, what was a bunch of techno-weenies toiling away in relative obscurity,\" McEachern said. \"Suddenly the spotlight went on this activity as the most advanced effort to begin addressing the robocalling problem.\"\n\nThe work advanced in recent months with the creation of a panel of telecom company representatives who will continue to update the verification system as robocall companies seek ways to beat it.\n\nThe private sector approach would enable tweaks to be rolled out more quickly than if changes had to go through a lengthy government approval process.\n\n\"This would enable tweaks to keep the robocallers from being three years ahead of you, all the time,\" McEachern said.\n\nConsumer advocates want the government to be more aggressive.\n\n\"Why is the FCC, given the exploding problem of scams and spoofed calls, and unwanted robocalls generally, not moving to require phone companies to implement caller authentication services across the board?\" asked Saunders, of the National Consumer Law Center. \"This should not be a voluntary effort.\"\n\nAdditionally, Saunders said, YouMail data show that scammers are not the largest source of robocalls. More come from debt collectors for banks or other companies \u2013 some of which, she said, are ringing up the wrong people.\n\n\"That also raises the question of should we be able to block other numbers, even those that are authenticated, that we want to stop calling us,\" Saunders added.\n\nWho pays?\n\nThe FCC says it does \"not expect any carrier to directly charge consumers for the implementation costs of the service.\"\n\n\"While we are not mandating how carriers absorb these costs,\" the regulator said in a statement, \"it would be more expensive for the typical carrier to attempt to allocate costs and bill subscribers individually.\"\n\nThe FCC also says it expects the system to reduce some carrier costs, \"particularly with respect to customer service.\"\n\n\"These savings, as well as the goodwill from reducing the impact of robocalls on their subscribers, may more than offset the costs of implementation,\" the commission said.\n\nU.S. Telecom, the trade group of the nation's broadband industry, does not expect major carriers will bill customers for the verification system.\n\nKevin Rupy, the group's vice president for law and policy, said some smaller carriers might need help with the cost and could seek assistance from the FCC's universal service fund.\n\nAdditionally,AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and other major carriers have partnered with call-blocking and anti-spam partner companies to provide customers with increased protection, he said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/15/robocalls-verification-system-ftc-fcc-telecommunications-caller-id-shaken-stir/1682591002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Ana Ceballos, Naples Daily News", "title": "Email shows Florida Democratic official sought to use altered forms for reaching voters with ballot problems", "description": "Florida Dems pushed altered form to reach absentee voters", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/15/florida-recount-democrats-launch-plan-altered-state-form-fix-ballots/2016030002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/38b2c335-1113-4e30-912a-33b66f063bd3/38b2c335-1113-4e30-912a-33b66f063bd3_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:59:27Z", "content": "TALLAHASSEE \u2013 A Democratic party official in Florida directed aides to share altered election forms with voters in an effort to fix ballot signature problems a day after polls closed in the key swing state, an email obtained by the USA TODAY NETWORK shows.

(Photo: Wilfredo Lee/AP)\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2013 A Democratic party official in Florida directed aides to share altered election forms with voters in an effort to fix ballot signature problems a day after polls closed in the key swing state, an email obtained by the USA TODAY NETWORK shows.\n\nThe email shows a Democratic party leader provided staff with altered copies of a state form that were modified to give the impression that voters had more time to correct signature problems with mailed-in ballots than they actually had under state law.\n\nThe altered forms, which turned up in four counties in the state, appear to be an effort to increase the number of Democratic ballots counted in the state's hotly contested races for governor and Senate, election experts said.\n\nIt is not clear whether the effort changed the tally in any of the state\u2019s marquee races, but election experts said altering the form is illegal and the controversy is likely to spur claims that party officials attempted to undermine the voting process.\n\nOfficials at the Florida Department of State said they asked federal prosecutors last week to investigate altered forms received by local election supervisors.\n\nJake Sanders, a Democratic campaign consultant in the state, told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida that he warned party officials about potential legal problems with the altered forms and was ignored.\n\n\"They should have been saying, 'This is unprecedented, we are fighting for your vote to count, fill this out so we can fight for you,'\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut self-imposing a fake deadline and deceiving people is counter to that.\"\n\nElection officials check the signatures on mailed ballots against the signatures they have on record. If they don\u2019t match, the ballot is set aside for further review. When that happens, a voter has the ability to resubmit their signature on a form to \u201ccure\u201d the difference between the signatures and have their ballot counted.\n\nThe email encouraged Florida Democrats to identify the challenged ballots and send the altered signature correction forms to voters. But the language was different: It replaced the deadline of 5 p.m. on Nov. 5, the day before the election, with a new deadline, \"no later than 5 p.m. Thursday Nov. 8.\"\n\nThe altered forms surfaced in Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties. It is not clear whether election officials in those counties actually accepted any of the altered signature forms, given that they would have arrived after the state\u2019s deadline.\n\nCharles Zelden, political science professor at Nova Southeastern University in Florida and an election expert, said the move presented the appearance of trying to game the system.\n\n(View the altered form here.)\n\n(View the unaltered form here.)\n\n\u201cBut a strict reading of the rules says if they don\u2019t get it in the day before the day of the election, those votes don\u2019t get counted anyhow. So on the surface, it\u2019s a very inefficient way to game the system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be a Hail Mary effort.\u201d\n\nZelden said that if \u201cthis is an attempt at fraud to sneak in votes that would have not been counted otherwise, I\u2019m just saying its chances of working are not great (but) it does play into the narrative of Republicans that this is a fraudulent effort and gives it some validity.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, including the state\u2019s governor and GOP Senate candidate Rick Scott and President Donald Trump, have been alleging fraud in the days since the Nov. 6 election. County officials were expected to complete a machine recount in three competitive statewide races on Thursday.\n\nA federal judge ruled Thursday that voters should have until Saturday to correct signatures on ballots, a move that could open the door for these ballots returned with altered forms to be counted. Republicans supporting Scott, who leads incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by less than 13,000 votes in the recount, appealed the ruling.\n\nJackie Schutz Zeckman, Scott's campaign manager, called on Nelson to demand the immediate resignation of Florida\u2019s Democrat Party Chair Terrie Rizzo.\n\n\"Democrats even admitted plans to fraudulently mislead voters in anticipation of including ballots submitted after the legal deadline if they could convince a judge to disregard Florida election law,\" Zeckman said. \"Federal prosecutors are also investigating this clear example of attempt to fraudulently mislead voters by the Democrat Party in Florida.\"\n\nNelson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDemocratic Party Executive Director Juan Penalosa also did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the use of the altered forms.\n\nThe party compiled a list of voters and their contact information across the state who had their vote-by-mail ballots flagged with signature problems, and therefore not eligible.\n\nIt is not clear how many altered forms were sent across the state, but an email drafted by the state party\u2019s central Florida deputy field director that was obtained by the USA TODAY Network-Florida outlined a step-by-step process for volunteers and staffers to follow to get as many voters as possible to submit the altered form three days after the deadline.\n\n\u201cThe voters MUST print out the form and sign it by hand,\u201d the party official, Jennifer Kim, wrote in the email that attached copies of the altered forms in both English and Spanish. The email also included a sheet with the contact information of all election supervisors in the state.\n\nKim was clear that staffers should target people who submitted absentee vote-by-mail ballots before Election Day and did not sign them properly. Her email subject line said \"VBM signature cure instructions\" and labeled the list of voters to be contacted as \"VBM signature chases.\"\n\nState Democrats have come under fire previously for suggesting to voters that the deadline to submit the ballot was later than it actually was. Pam Keith, a Palm Beach County Democrat, posted a Nov. 7 tweet in which she encouraged people to fix their absentee ballots two days after the state-mandated deadline.\n\nKeith told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida that she was aware the deadline to submit \"cure affidavits\" had expired but she told people there was still time to fix their absentee ballots.\n\n\"I was trying to show that if given notice, voters would try to fix their ballots,\" Keith said. \"I was putting the word out because I was anticipating a (legal) challenge of that deadline.\"\n\nAn email that Jennifer Kim, Florida Democratic Party\u2019s central deputy field director, sent Nov. 7 to party workers instructing them how to give voters an altered form to fix signature problems with their absentee ballots after the state deadline. Kim\u2019s email shows this is a statewide effort to give voters the altered form with the wrong deadline to return it. The altered forms have turned up in several counties and have been turned over to federal prosecutors to review for possible election fraud. (Photo: Submitted Photo)\n\nShe later deleted the tweet.\n\nThe Department of State, which oversees elections in Florida, raised concerns about the alterations, arguing that making changes to a state form is a criminal offense.\n\nElection experts said that if state Democrats had sent a notice to their voters with challenged ballots, encouraging them to attempt to correct their signatures even though the deadline to do so had passed, they\u2019d likely be in the clear.\n\nThe legal problem for Democrats is that they distributed the altered elections form, said Michael McDonald, an election expert at the University of Florida and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The political problem, he said, could be wider if it casts doubt on their intentions.\n\nMcDonald likened the episode to another this year in which an election supervisor in heavily Republican Bay County counted ballots cast by email or fax, which is not permitted.\n\n\u201cIn both cases, there were efforts to ensure that voters\u2019 ballots would be counted and so while there were maybe violations of the law, I wouldn\u2019t be going after either one of these,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, undoubtedly, that\u2019s not how this is going to play out.\u201d\n\nContributing: John Fritze and Ledyard King.\n\nCLOSE The recount began 5 p.m. Saturday in Palm Beach County.

I've kind of used this pedestal or whatever you want to say to spread knowledge that the game is fun,\" he said Thursday after his runaway victory for the AL MVP award.\n\nMilwaukee's Christian Yelich was close to a unanimous pick for the NL honor. A 26-year-old outfielder just like Betts, Yelich also won a batting championship and led his team to a division title. But while Betts has been with the Red Sox since he signed after the 2011 amateur draft, Yelich didn't join the Brewers until he was dealt to Milwaukee last January by the payroll-paring Miami Marlins.\n\n\"I'm thankful it all worked out because being traded, you never know how it's going to be,\" Yelich said. \"Luckily for myself, it all went amazing.\"\n\nYelich is signed through 2021 and his deal includes a team option for the following season. Betts didn't want to speculate whether he would be a Red Sox lifer, like former Boston MVPs Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski and Jim Rice. Betts can become a free agent after the 2020 season.\n\n\"Right now I'm just focusing on the 2019 season coming up,\" he said.\n\nBetts received 28 first-place votes and 410 points from the Baseball Writers' Association of America.\n\nLos Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout, a two-time MVP, followed with one first-place vote and 265 points.

Votes were submitted before the postseason.\n\nBetts, second to Trout in the 2016 vote, raised his profile when he fed homeless people on the steps of Boston's Public Library after the second game of the World Series. Unlike some baseball players, he doesn't eschew off-the-field limelight. Commissioner Rob Manfred criticized Trout during the All-Star Game for not making enough of a marketing effort.\n\n\"I definitely think it's pretty cool in some settings,\" he said, \"and in some setting settings I just kind of want to be with my family.\"\n\nBoth batting champions won MVP awards for the first time since San Francisco's Buster Posey and Detroit's Miguel Cabrera in 2012.\n\nYelich got 29 first-place votes and 415 points, and the other first-place vote went to New York Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom, the NL Cy Young Award winner, who finished fifth. Chicago Cubs infielder Javier Baez was second with 250 points, followed by Colorado third baseman Nolan Arenado with 203.\n\nYelich won the first batting title in Brewers history with a .326 average. He set career highs with 36 homers and 110 RBIs and had a 1.000 OPS.\n\nYelich nearly became the NL's first Triple Crown winner since Joe Medwick in 1937, finishing two homers shy of Arenado and one RBI back of Baez. Yelich was especially impressive in the second half, hitting .367 with 25 homers and 67 RBIs \u2014 including 11 homers in August and 10 in September.\n\nMilwaukee reached the playoffs for the first time in seven years, swept Colorado in the Division Series then lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a seven-game League Championship Series, falling one win short of its first World Series appearance since 2002.\n\nYelich gets a $100,000 bonus for winning, and the price of the 2022 team option in his contract increased by $1 million to $16 million.\n\nYelich celebrated in Southern California with family and friends, including Heisman Trophy winner and Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Odell Beckham Jr. says more than a couple of people scoffed last week when he said the New York Giants could win their final eight games and make the playoffs.\n\nThe NFL's highest-paid receiver knew it was a long shot when he made the statement and little has changed since the Giants beat the San Francisco 49ers 27-23 on Monday night. It's just seven games now.\n\nStill, Beckham was not backing off the idea Thursday before the Giants (2-7) practiced for Sunday's game at MetLife Stadium against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-6).\n\n\"I don't know what makes me not believe it,\" Beckham said. \"That's just the goal. Same thing I said before the season, the goal is to win a Super Bowl. It's always going to win a Super Bowl. If you're just here to have fun or whatever else, I don't think you should be here. The goal is to win every game. I'm trying to win. If we play 16, I'm trying to win 16. Win the four in the playoffs, and win the Super Bowl. You never want to lose.\n\n\"My mentality is going to be win these last seven games, no matter who believes it or what's said, or anything like that,\" Beckham added. \"That's going to be my goal.\"\n\nCoach Pat Shurmur doesn't mind his players talking about running the table.\n\n\"I think he is just giving you his long-range approach,\" Shurmur said. \"If you ask him, he will tell you he is putting all his energy into playing Tampa. That's the challenge. We have to stay in the moment. We have to keep the noise out, and that's the same whether you win or lose a game.\"\n\nThe Giants have done a lot of losing the past 1\u00bd seasons. They have won five of 25 games and not won two straight since December 2016.\n\nStill, the upcoming schedule is not horrible. The Giants don't have games against any of the NFL's dominant teams: the Rams, Chiefs, Saints, Chargers, Patriots or Steelers.\n\nOf the seven games left, Chicago (6-3), Washington (6-3) and Tennessee (5-4) have winning records. Indianapolis, Philadelphia and Dallas are 4-5, although the Eagles and Cowboys beat the Giants this season.\n\nSo there is a chance, slim as it may be.\n\n\"I don't think it's crazy to think that way at all,\" rookie running back Saquon Barkley said. \"I think that's what we all feel in this locker room, we all feel on this team. We're more than capable of doing that, but we're not na\u00efve to the fact that it's a long season and you can't really think, oh, we got to win eight games, because that's not the mindset. That's what we want to do, but the mindset is taking care of every single day and every single game, one day at a time.\"\n\nNOTES: Running back Jonathan Stewart, who has been on injured reserve since Sept. 28 with a foot injury, has been designated for return/returned to practice. The Giants have until Dec. 6 to decide to either activate him or keep him on injured reserve for the remainder of the season. He is not eligible to return to the active roster until Nov. 26.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Helton realizes fans are unhappy just one season after he led the Trojans to the Pac-12 title. (AP Photo/Timothy J. Gonzalez, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHere are some things to watch this week in the Pac-12 Conference:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK: There's nothing on the line, but perhaps the most compelling matchup this week is the rivalry game between USC and UCLA because of the drama that surrounds it. The Trojans were officially eliminated from contention for the Pac-12 title game with last weekend's loss to Cal at the Coliseum. The loss amped up the talk that Clay Helton's days at USC may be over. A loss to the team's rival would seem to all but cement his fate. On the other sideline there's the enigmatic Chip Kelly, who hasn't fared as well as some Bruins boosters would have liked in his first season as head coach. The Bruins have been eliminated from championship contention, too. A big rivalry win at the Rose Bowl would give those boosters something to cheer.\n\nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK: Stanford quarterback K.J. Costello against California's defense. While Gardner Minshew has cornered the attention market among Pac-12 North QBs, Costello is putting up solid numbers in his sophomore season. He ranks second in the league (behind Minshew, of course) with an average of 285.4 passing yards per game, and he's thrown 23 touchdowns. He ranks atop the conference for passing efficiency (156.9). Cal's D, meanwhile, ranks atop the league for pass defense efficiency (112.0), interceptions (14) and overall pass defense, allowing opponents an average of 183.8 passing yards a game.\n\nNUMBERS GAME: There are three teams in play in the South, so here are the scenarios for a trip to the Pac-12 championship: Arizona State controls its own destiny, and can capture the South's berth with victories at Oregon and then in the rivalry game against Arizona. Utah needs to win this weekend at Colorado (the Utes finish up against BYU) and get help with a Sun Devils loss in one of their last two games. The Wildcats need to win out (against Washington State this weekend and the rivalry game) and hope for a Colorado victory over the Utes. ... The North could come down to the Apple Cup. Washington and Washington State can clinch the berth by winning out. The Huskies host Oregon State this weekend, while the No. 8 Cougars have Arizona. ... Speaking of the Huskies, they have a 13-game winning streak at home. The Cougars' home streak is at 12. ... Jake Browning has 91 career touchdown passes, ranking him sixth on the Pac-12 all-time list. Jared Goff is fifth with 96. ... Stanford is bowl eligible for a 10th straight year.\n\nUPSET WATCH: Right now Utah is a 7-point favorite over Colorado. The Utes jumped back into the rankings at No. 21 after a convincing win over Oregon last weekend. Colorado, on the other hand, has lost five straight, and has just been decimated by injuries this season. But the Buffaloes got receiver Laviska Shenault back last week after a three-game absence and he had a 100-yard receiving game in a 31-7 loss to Washington State. And the Buffs are at home. So maybe this is a good time for Colorado to salvage a season that started out with such promise.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER: Matt Gay, who won the Lou Groza award for the nation's best kicker, seems to just be getting better. If that's possible. Gay made all six of his field goal attempts in Utah's victory over Oregon last weekend, a school record. His 20 points tied a team record for a kicker, too. Among those field goals was a career-long 55-yarder. He's made 18 straight FGs, tying the school record.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

His body of work, however, was second to none.\n\nHe led the major leagues in batting average (.346) and slugging (.640), the first Red Sox to lead both those categories in one season since Williams in 1946. He hit 32 home runs as part of a startling 79 extra-base hits. His 10.9 Wins Above Replacement, as measured by Baseball-Reference, are the most by a position player since Barry Bonds' 11.8 in 2002.\n\nHe also stole 30 bases, and according to the Elias Sports Bureau, is the only major leaguer to win a batting title while also posting a 30-homer, 30-steal season.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that he received 28 of 30 first-place votes to easily out-point Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout, who along with Betts' teammate J.D. Martinez received the other first-place votes.\n\nTrout, a two-time MVP, joins Ted Williams, Albert Pujols and Stan Musial as the only players with four runner-up MVP finishes.\n\nCleveland's Jose Ramirez finished third and Martinez finished fourth.\n\nBetts and Martinez did damage all season and reached several historic benchmarks. Perhaps most impressively, they were the first set of teammates since 1903 to finish 1-2 in the major leagues in both slugging and batting average; the Pirates' Honus Wagner and Fred Clarke were the last to do so.\n\nBetts reiterated Thursday that Martinez's addition to the squad, along with first-year manager Alex Cora, made him a better player, one who finished as AL MVP runner-up in 2016, regressed a year later and then became undeniably the league's best player after the addition of a new manager and designated hitter.\n\n\"The things you didn\u2019t see,\" Betts said, \"made the year so special.\"\n\nAnd in the end, Betts stood alone.\n\nFollow Lacques on Twitter @GabeLacques"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Jets' Josh Morrissey fined, not suspended, for slamming Capitals' TJ Oshie to ice", "description": "Jets defenseman Josh Morrissey was fined $8,468 for unsportsmanlike conduct in play that was similar to one that netted another player two games.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/11/15/jets-morrissey-fined-not-suspended-for-slamming-oshie/38538747/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/15/USAT/b91663c8-51dc-4021-b941-7227b81f4242-josh_morrissey.JPG?crop=3767,2119,x0,y76&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:45:12Z", "content": "Winnipeg Jets defenseman Josh Morrissey (44) was fined for a takedown of Washington's T.J.

But he knows exactly what he\u2019d do should a reversed situation arise during the championship race.\n\n\u201cDepends on who\u2019s in front of me,\u201d Truex told For The Win on Thursday. But if it\u2019s Logano? \u201cOf course. An eye for an eye.\u201d\n\nLogano knows that\u2019s how Truex would approach this hypothetical situation because he said it\u2019s part of racing. The No. 22 Ford driver distinguished between what he did at Martinsville and full-on wrecking another driver because Truex still finished third in what turned out to be a drag race across the finish line with Denny Hamlin in second.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less,\u201d Logano told FTW. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got here, right? We\u2019re racers, we\u2019re going to race hard. I think bump and run is totally acceptable in a lot of cases.\n\n\u201cNow, spinning someone out is a different play. To me, it\u2019s different, but everyone\u2019s rules are different. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to put yourself in a position to go out there and win it.\u201d\n\nBut Logano doesn\u2019t see his attitude as a \u201cfree pass\u201d for Truex to wreck him at any time, and it didn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s how Truex interpreted their previous conversation.\n\nElaborating on his Code of Hammurabi mentality, Truex said: \u201cI have a free pass. He already told me I could (bump him for the lead). He told me he\u2019s fair game, so here we go.\u201d\n\nIn response, Logano repeated a tired drivers\u2019 cliche about anticipating others will race him the same way he races them. So he\u2019d accept a similar bump-and-run move but certainly not getting thrown into the wall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a hard racer, (and) I expect to get raced hard,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI didn\u2019t crash him, moved him up enough to have a drag race. That\u2019s what I explained to him.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "AP reporter recounts NorCal wildfire body search", "description": "As firefighters searched the ruins of Paradise, California for the remains of those lost in a deadly wildfire, AP reporter Gillian Flaccus was there when two bodies were found.

(AP Photo/Chris Seward, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida State is battling recent history as it looks to extend one of its most cherished streaks.\n\nThe Seminoles (4-6, 2-5 Atlantic Coast Conference) must knock off No. 22 Boston College (7-3, 4-2) on Saturday and then No. 15 Florida (7-3) to extend their bowl streak, which dates to 1982. While Florida State has dug quite the hole for itself, the roadblocks ahead are daunting \u2014 the Seminoles are 0-7 against ranked teams since the start of the 2017 season.\n\n\"It's important to us,\" coach Willie Taggart said. \"It's important to our players, it's important to our fan base, it's important to the teams that came before us that we keep it going and we talked about it as a team and our guys understand what's at stake, it's important for our seniors to leave here and not be that senior class that didn't go to a bowl game.\"\n\nThe Seminoles' bowl streak began in December 1982 when they were invited to the Gator Bowl and defeated West Virginia. They have gone to a bowl in 36 straight seasons, including a 14-year run of top-5 finishes in the Top 25 from 1987-2000 under coach Bobby Bowden. The streak is so long that it's older than current Florida State offensive coordinator Walt Bell, who was born in June 1984.\n\nThe streak has had some close calls, including last season as Florida State had to rally in November to make a run to a bowl game. The Seminoles were 3-6 before they defeated Delaware State, Florida and Louisiana-Monroe to become bowl-eligible.\n\nThat stretch was easier as Florida State didn't face a ranked team. This time the Seminoles have finished with six ranked opponents in their final seven games.\n\nBowden said he won't be disappointed if the bowl streak is broken.\n\n\"It's like all streaks \u2014 it's made to be broken,\" said Bowden, who guided Florida State to national titles in 1993 and '99. \"Now whether it will be broken this year or not, I don't know. It doesn't last.\"\n\nAnd this may be the year. The Seminoles have lost three straight games by a combined 148-51, which is the most points given up by Florida State in a three-game stretch in program history. A defense that was applying pressure to the quarterback as well as stopping the run now has struggled in the last three games. In losses to Clemson, NC State and Notre Dame, Florida State hasn't recorded a sack and has given up 662 rushing yards.\n\nFlorida State's offense found some success in a 48-27 loss at NC State two weeks ago, where James Blackman filled in and threw for 421 yards and four touchdowns. But neither Blackman nor Deondre Francois, who returned from a rib injury in the 42-13 loss at Notre Dame, have been able to rally the Seminoles.\n\nStill, players say the streak is priority. And to many, it is the \"only thing that's on our mind right now,\" said cornerback Stanford Samuels III.\n\n\"That's the main thing coach is talking about, making sure these seniors go out with a bang,\" said Samuels, whose father played for Florida State in the early 2000s. \"Making sure we finish the season how we're supposed to, not ruining the legacy. We definitely don't want to be looked at as the ones that ended the bowl streak.\"\n\nBowden said fans must be patient with Taggart, who led rebuilding efforts at Western Kentucky and South Florida before spending one season at Oregon. Now in his first year at Florida State, Taggart looks to repair the foundation for the program.\n\n\"It's like anyone who takes on a job,\" Bowden said. \"You got to turn it around. Period. You have to come in and set a standard for your program. Then you've got to recruit the best players.\"\n\nThe standard that Bowden and his teams set, one of consistently playing in the postseason, now hangs in the balance.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He also led NL position players in Wins Above Replacement (7.6).\n\nYelich might have stolen the award from Baez over the season's final two months: He hit 21 home runs and batted .335 in August and September, and twice hit for the cycle. In his final five games, Yelich reached base 16 times in 21 plate appearances, including three home runs.\n\nThe finishing kick pushed the Brewers into a 163rd and decisive game against Baez's Cubs, and their 3-1 victory gave them their first division title since 2011.\n\nThe Brewers went on to sweep Colorado in the NL Division Series before losing in seven games to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Championship Series. In 2019, they will return the top two NL players based on WAR in Yelich and center fielder Lorenzo Cain, who signed a five-year contract the same January week the Brewers traded for Yelich.\n\nThat may go down as one of the greatest weeks in franchise history.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Julio Jones seems to take pleasure in shutting down questions about his accomplishments.\n\nIt comes to him as naturally as catching a pass over the middle and stiff-arming a defender for extra yards.\n\nJones, the Atlanta Falcons' star wideout, last week became the quickest player in NFL history to reach 10,000 yards receiving. He accomplished the feat in 104 games, easily breaking Calvin Johnson's mark of 115.\n\nBut Jones refuses to take much credit, pointing out that quarterback Matt Ryan, his teammate since the Falcons drafted him sixth overall in 2011, and many others played an equally big role.\n\n\"For me, I'm never an individual guy,\" Jones said Thursday. \"I couldn't have done it by myself. It was just like Matt did a great job giving me opportunities, the offensive line. It's like one of those things that I can't go out there and play by myself \u2014 football is the ultimate team sport. I don't know. I feel regular.\"\n\nFalcons offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian, in his second season working with Jones, has a pretty good idea why his big playmaker causes so many matchup problems even as he's constantly double-teamed. Linebackers often aren't fast enough to cover him. Defensive backs are often too small to tackle the 6-foot-3, 220-pounder.\n\n\"It's incredible how much ground he can cover,\" Sarkisian said. \"You can tell two guys to run a six-step route. He may get to 20 yards and another guy might run it at 14 or 15. He can just cover so much ground, and then his explosiveness to get in and out of breaks, for a man that size, is very impressive.\"\n\nJones is more concerned with helping the Falcons (4-5) beat Dallas (4-5) to stay in the NFC playoff hunt. The Cowboys' secondary has only two interceptions but is still a threat with cornerbacks Byron Jones, Chidobe Awuzie and safeties Jeff Heath and Xavier Woods having combined for 22 pass breakups.\n\n\"Cover-three team, mix in a little man, and they do have cover-two in there,\" Jones said. \"But who knows how they're going to play us? They're going to be who they are, and we can probably expect them to come in with one-high (safety).\"\n\nIn last week's loss at Cleveland, the Falcons couldn't answer quickly enough when they trailed by 18 points midway through the third quarter. Knowing Atlanta was no longer a threat to run the ball, the Browns dropped back in coverage and kept everything in front of them.\n\nJones wants the Falcons to establish the run early and maintain it throughout the game. Ryan needs the threat of play-action to keep the linebackers up and let his receivers get open for big gains.\n\n\"Not taking anything away from Cleveland, but there were some opportunities that we've got to take advantage of,\" Jones said. \"There are always things out there that you miss on the field, but that's more so on us. We've made the corrections.\"\n\nNotes: Thursday marked the first day that K Matt Bryant was listed as a full participant in practice since Week 6. Bryant, the career franchise scoring leader, has been sidelined with a sore hamstring. If he is able to play, the Falcons might release Giorgio Tavecchio to add depth at other positions. ... MLB Deion Jones, returning from a foot injury that's sidelined him since Week 1, was a limited participant for the second straight day. ... Also limited were WR Mohamed Sanu (hip), S Damontae Kazee (shoulder), DE Derrick Shelby (groin), LBs De'Vondre Campbell (calf) and Bruce Carter (knee).\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Don Wright, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Matthew Stafford and the Detroit Lions have three straight home games coming up \u2014 probably their last chance to turn their season around and make a run at a playoff spot.\n\nThe opposition is formidable, though.\n\nAfter three consecutive losses, the Lions host Carolina on Sunday. That game is followed by a Thanksgiving matchup with Chicago and another home test against the NFC West-leading Rams. There's time for Detroit to rally, but the path forward looks difficult.\n\n\"I think everybody's doing everything they can to try and get us going,\" said Stafford, whose team has scored only 20 first-half points over the past three games. \"I think it's a total team effort. Everybody's trying to play better at all positions.\"\n\nThe Lions (3-6) will face a Carolina team that's in a much better spot, although the Panthers (6-3) are trying to rebound as well from their most recent outing, a 52-21 loss to the Steelers on Nov. 8. The 52 points allowed tied the most in franchise history. Pittsburgh scored on seven of its first eight possessions.\n\n\"I don't think that is indicative of who we are as a football team,\" Panthers coach Ron Rivera said. \"One game is not going to define who we are going forward. It is an example of what happens if we don't play to our abilities and stick to our fundamentals, don't play the defense, offense or special teams play the way that it is called.\"\n\nThe Lions and Panthers are in different divisions, but they did meet last season, when Carolina won 27-24 in Detroit. Cam Newton threw for three touchdowns in that game, and Stafford threw for two.\n\nA few more things to watch when the Lions host the Panthers:\n\nMISMATCH?\n\nThe Lions are 28th in the NFL against the run, and now they'll have to face Carolina's versatile running back Christian McCaffrey, who has seven touchdowns in the past three weeks. McCaffrey has run 45 times for 201 yards and caught 14 passes for 150 yards during that span.\n\nMcCaffrey has been on the field for 96 percent of his team's offensive snaps, more than any running back in the NFL.\n\nROLLING\n\nNewton has thrown for at least two touchdowns in eight consecutive games, a franchise record.\n\n\"Obviously one of the most dangerous quarterbacks in the NFL and someone that can really change the outcome of the game all by himself,\" Lions coach Matt Patricia said. \"Still has obviously all the athletic ability, the arm strength now just kind of combined with the experience and his knowledge of the game. And he's just really been able to take it to the next level and carry those guys around him.\"\n\nSPEED ON TURF\n\nThe Panthers will get to see how their much-improved team speed does in their first game this season on artificial turf.\n\nCarolina added D.J. Moore from Maryland in the first round of the NFL draft, while fellow wide receiver Curtis Samuel back after an injury-plagued rookie season.\n\n\"It's going to be fun to see,\" Rivera said. \"We've got some quick guys who will be even quicker on turf.\"\n\nPROTECTION\n\nDetroit has allowed 16 sacks in the past two games, and the Lions put guard T.J. Lang on injured reserve this week. The Lions still have a couple of recent first-round draft picks on their offensive line in Taylor Decker and Frank Ragnow, but pass protection will be an area to watch this week.\n\nDetroit's running game has improved a bit, but it wasn't of much use last week after the Lions fell behind 26-0 in the second quarter of a loss at Chicago .\n\nMEETING AGAIN\n\nDE Julius Peppers of the Panthers is still a factor at age 38. He had a sack in the game against Pittsburgh.\n\nBack in 2010, Peppers sacked Stafford, injuring his right shoulder. Peppers played for Chicago then, and he's also spent time with Green Bay, so the Lions have seen plenty of him.\n\n\"He's 6-6, 295 pounds, whatever he is. Extremely athletic, very smart player,\" Stafford said. \"He's seen a lot of football, he's a smart rusher. We've seen him do just some things late in the pass rush, getting sacks, that's pretty special.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He's a great guy, great teammate,\" Harden said. \"It just didn't work out. It's part of the business.\"\n\nHouston thought he could be the piece it needed to finally get past Golden State and win its first championship since back-to-back titles in 1994-95. Instead the Rockets limped out to a 6-7 start and the emergence of undrafted rookie Gary Clark made it appear that Anthony would have to take a reduced role.\n\nIn the end the Rockets decided it would be better to move on than to force Anthony to do that.\n\n\"We just had to see how things worked out,\" D'Antoni said. \"And the way we play probably wasn't conducive to his game and he was trying to make the necessary sacrifices and it wasn't fair to him as a Hall of Fame player to play in a way that wasn't good for him, wasn't good for us. It just wasn't a fit.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old is a 10-time All-Star who has had a tough time over the last two seasons. He averaged a career-low 16.2 points in 78 starts in a tumultuous season for the Thunder last season before coming to Houston \u2014 and accepting a reserve role for the first time in his 16-year career.\n\nEight of Anthony's 10 appearances for the Rockets came off the bench after he had started all 1,054 games he'd played in his first 15 NBA seasons.\n\nD'Antoni said he feels for Anthony that things ended this way and made it clear that it wasn't a matter of Anthony not having the right attitude in Houston.\n\n\"In the summer we tried to hit a home run and it didn't work out,\" D'Antoni said. \"He tried everything he could. He was great while he was here. It just didn't work out for whatever reason. I just thank him for his professionalism. It was good. He tried everything he could to make it work and it just didn't work out.\"\n\nThe third overall pick in the 2003 draft has averaged 24 points, 6.5 rebounds and 3 assists in a career that also included stints with the Denver Nuggets and the New York Knicks.\n\nAnthony sat out Houston's last three games with what the team called an illness. His last appearance for Houston came in a blowout loss to Oklahoma City on Nov. 8 when he had two points and five rebounds.\n\nD'Antoni expects the rest of the Rockets to handle this professionally, but knows that the move will be tough on them.\n\n\"I'm sure they hate it,\" D'Antoni said. \"There's some good friends in there and there will be friendships. But above all this is a business.\"\n\nIt's unclear what's next for Anthony, but Chris Paul, who has long been friends with him, knows he'll be OK.\n\n\"For Melo it's all about just him being happy,\" Paul said. \"So wherever that is or whatever's next he's going to figure it out.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 The standings give Malcolm Jenkins and the Philadelphia Eagles all the motivation they need against the New Orleans Saints.\n\nTrash talk doesn't matter when your season is on the line.\n\nThe Saints (8-1) were 10 seconds away from facing the Eagles in the NFC championship game last January before the \"Minneapolis Miracle\" ended their season.\n\nAlvin Kamara used colorful language when he told a reporter in August the Saints would've defeated the Eagles, who ended up routing the Vikings and beating the Patriots for their first Super Bowl title.\n\n\"We won the Super Bowl,\" Jenkins said. \"The bulletin board material is more for you guys than us.\"\n\nKamara explained his thoughts Thursday.\n\n\"I don't care if we're playing against the Monstars (from \"Space Jam\"). My team, whatever team I'm on, I'm going to say we're going to win. Period,\" the star running back said. \"And I guarantee it's the same way with any other guy in this league that feels strongly about the team they're on. ... It's no disrespect, direct disrespect to, you know, I didn't call a name or call like direct names. It's just my team against your team. And that's all I'm going to say about that.\"\n\nThe Eagles (4-5) trail Washington (6-3) in the NFC East and need an upset to avoid falling further behind. That's plenty of incentive when they face Kamara and the Saints on Sunday at the Superdome.\n\n\"I have a laundry list of reasons why I want to be excited for this game,\" said Jenkins, who played his first five seasons in New Orleans. \"One, is it's our next game. Two, our season is kind of in the balance. I could go on for days, so I don't need any more motivation.\"\n\nThe Saints would've presented a different challenge for the Eagles 10 months ago for various reasons. Foremost, Drew Brees is an elite quarterback who already won a playoff game in Philadelphia's hostile stadium.\n\nInstead, Case Keenum led the Vikings to Philadelphia and tossed a momentum-changing pick-6 in the first quarter. Nick Foles and the offense did the rest in a 38-7 victory.\n\n\"It is done and gone,\" Brees said about the team's last-second loss to Minnesota in the divisional round. \"I thought about it back then, but not now. It is a new season, new team. Here we are now, we're playing now.\"\n\nWhile the Eagles are desperate for a win, the Saints are trying to keep pace with the Rams (9-1). They already own the tiebreaker for the No. 1 seed because of a win over Los Angeles.\n\n\"We have our work cut out for us and we know what type of game it's going to be,\" Brees said. \"We know they're coming in hungry for a win. Both teams have a lot to play for.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brett Martel in New Orleans contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I like this guy.' He's a great father. He's a great leader for the Chargers,\" Miller said. \"I know some guys over there in Melvin Ingram and Melvin Gordon and they say the same thing about him.\n\n\"Everybody loves him. I've got a lot of respect for him and this game's going to be a good one.\"\n\nMiller said so many other defenders are bothered by Rivers because of his talent and renowned trash talk.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it's trash because his trash talking really doesn't bother me: 'Got the first down, sucker!' It really doesn't bother me. Some guys it does, but not me,\" Miller said. \"I like playing against Philip. He's a good guy.\"\n\nMiller has sacked Rivers 15 times , by far the most of any quarterback he's ever faced and almost twice as many times as No. 2 on the list, Alex Smith, with eight.\n\nRivers said Miller is even more dangerous opposite rookie Bradley Chubb.\n\nCombined, they have 17 sacks so far.\n\n\"Those are two really good rushers, really good football players,\" Rivers said. \"I think Von plays the heck out of the run. So does Chubb.\"\n\nMiller said Rivers has never been better.\n\nHe's getting the ball out quicker than ever, the Chargers' ground game is the best it's been in years and L.A.'s O-line is playing exceptionally well, all reasons Rivers has only been sacked a dozen times so far.\n\n\"It's the best Chargers team that I have played in my career,\" said Miller, an eighth-year pro.\n\nSo, who's replaced Rivers atop Miller's enemies list?\n\n\"I don't really have any enemies at quarterback,\" Miller said. \"Now, offensive linemen, it's different. But you know quarterbacks, whenever I get close to them they fall or they run away. Those are the type of pants I like to wear.\n\n\"I'm pretty cool with quarterbacks.

(Photo: Mark Lennihan/AP)\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration\u2019s naive plan to ban menthol cigarettes will lead to countless unintended consequences, including increased youth smoking, especially in minority communities, where a ban would spark illegal markets reminiscent of the days of alcohol prohibition.\n\nKids could easily buy loose cigarettes stored in sealed baggies with unwrapped menthol cough drops. The FDA has failed to enforce its own rules. Consider the agency\u2019s inability to prevent youth use of e-cigarettes, despite an outright federal ban.\n\nOne unintended consequence is telling: The ban unites some African-American civil rights leaders and top law enforcement officer groups.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and Ben Chavis, former executive director of the NAACP, harshly criticized the idea last year, claiming that it would \u201caffect black communities more than other communities\u201d and keep police from \u201csolving violent crime and ensuring public safety.\u201d\n\nOUR VIEW: There\u2019s more than just smoke to FDA proposals\n\nCiting a National Research Council report on America\u2019s criminal justice system, they blame policy, not increased crime, for the incarceration crisis. A menthol ban would make a bad situation worse.\n\nThe Alabama State Trooper Association, the Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and other police groups have warned that a ban would create criminal enterprises.\n\nIt would also be ineffective. Jeff Washington, a 52-year-old who started smoking menthol Newports when he joined the Army in 1983, told The Wall Street Journal that if menthols were banned, \u201cI\u2019d start smoking Marlboros.\u201d\n\nRather, Washington should use e-cigarettes. But the FDA, which failed to prevent youth from buying e-cigarettes, is making it harder for him to switch.\n\nPresident Donald Trump should ask FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, in an exit interview, why the agency couldn\u2019t achieve a central promise of his presidency: Improve our lives not with more regulation but with less of it, wisely implemented.\n\nJeff Stier is a senior fellow at the Consumer Choice Center.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/15/menthol-ban-makes-bad-situation-worse-editorials-debates/2018265002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 4 Michigan hosts Indiana in final game before Big Game", "description": "No. 4 Michigan hosts Indiana, the last chance to fine tune its offense, defense and special teams before playing at No. 8 Ohio State with a spot in the conference championship on the line", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/15/no-4-michigan-hosts-indiana-in-final-game-before-big-game/38538621/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:51:55Z", "content": "Indiana (5-5, 2-5 Big Ten) at No. 4 Michigan (9-1, 7-0, No. 4 CFP), 4 p.m. EST (FS1) Line: Michigan by 28\u00bd.

He says doctors first thought the damage his elbows had received during his playing days in the 1980s and 1990s was the culprit. But the problems didn't go away after surgery and his voice also began to get weak before he was diagnosed with ALS.\n\nThe 54-year-old Green, the Orange All-American who played eight seasons in the NFL with the Atlanta Falcons, writes that the version of the disease, known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, that he has is slow-progressing and that he's \"extremely grateful\" for that.\n\nA best-selling author since his playing days, Green will appear on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday night to tell his story. He's one of at least 16 other former NFL players to have suffered from ALS.

USA TODAY\n\nCarmelo Anthony (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Carmelo Anthony Experiment is over in Houston after just 10 appearances.\n\nAnthony will not rejoin the team although the Rockets do not plan to place him on waivers yet.\n\n\u201cAfter much internal discussion, the Rockets will be parting ways with Carmelo Anthony and we are working toward a resolution,\u201d Rockets general manager Daryl Morey said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\u201cCarmelo had a tremendous approach during his time with the Rockets and accepted every role head coach Mike D\u2019Antoni gave him. The fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized, therefore we thought it was best to move on as any other outcome would have been unfair to him.\u201d\n\nAnthony averaged 13.4 points and 5.4 rebounds but shot 40.5 percent from the field and 32.8 percent on 3-pointers in his 10 games \u2014 eight of them as a reserve, a role that he wasn't familiar with.\n\nHis struggles with Houston were illuminated in his final game with the team Nov. 8 against Oklahoma City, the team he played for last season \u2013 another situation that didn\u2019t work out for the 10-time All-Star and three-time Olympic gold medalist. Against the Thunder, he was 1-for-11 from the field and 0-for-6 on 3-pointers.\n\nHouston\u2019s early struggles combined with Anthony\u2019s inability to find his place expedited the split.\n\nDon\u2019t let 7-7 Houston pin its struggles on Anthony. Trevor Ariza and Luc Richard Mbah a Moute departed in free agency, and Houston isn't the same this season. The Rockets have the 21st-ranked defense, allowing 109.3 points per 100 possessions, and their high-power offense from last season is MIA, ranking 22nd in a season when scoring is up. That\u2019s not Anthony\u2019s fault.\n\nWhat's next for Anthony?\n\nCarmelo Anthony (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP)\n\nThat\u2019s a great question for the 34-year-old veteran in his 16th NBA season. Once one of the game\u2019s best scorers \u2014 he led the league in scoring in 2012-13 and is 19th on the all-time scoring list with 25,551 points \u2014 Anthony's game doesn\u2019t mesh with today\u2019s NBA, especially if he can\u2019t shoot and score like he once did. And that scoring isn\u2019t returning, not at this stage of his career.\n\nFather Time and a changing NBA have caught up with Anthony \u2014 someone who wants to play 30 minutes a game.\n\nIf Anthony is willing to play a smaller role off the bench, it\u2019s feasible to see him carving out a place in the final seasons of his career. But is he willing to do that? He didn\u2019t want that role with the Thunder, and it didn\u2019t work out with Houston.\n\nThere\u2019s always been talk that if Anthony was willing to play the role he had with the U.S. Olympic team, he could find a comfortable fit. There, he didn\u2019t require lots of playing time, shots or points, wasn\u2019t ball dominant and played physical defense.\n\nBut Olympic Carmelo has never surfaced in the NBA. Maybe Olympic Carmelo isn\u2019t made for the NBA.\n\nWill another team take a chance on him? Probably. But unless there\u2019s a change in his mindset and his game, the outcome will be the same.\n\nFollow Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Vaunted offenses meet in Chiefs' relocated clash with Rams", "description": "The Chiefs are visiting the Rams in one of the biggest games of the NFL season and a possible Super Bowl preview", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/15/vaunted-offenses-meet-in-chiefs-relocated-clash-with-rams/38538589/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7960103d7f760a38cb3988c30f45eb7822868ee8/c=0-208-4007-2462/local/-/media/2018/11/15/USATODAY/usatsports/f241dd25b98d4f489cf03a146dbb8262.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:46:11Z", "content": "FILE - In this Sunday Oct. 28, 2018 file photo, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid watches the game during an NFL football game against the Denver Broncos in Kansas City, Mo.

The Chiefs (9-1) visit the Rams (9-1) in a game originally scheduled for Mexico City before poor field conditions at Azteca Stadium prompted the NFL to move the game to California on six days\u2019 notice. Instead, the Coliseum will host a prime-time meeting of two incredibly prolific offenses masterminded by two coaches separated by 28 years of age, but together on the cutting edge of football.(AP Photo/Reed Hoffmann, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Sean McVay has looked up to Andy Reid for years. The Los Angeles Rams' young coach constantly studies video of his Kansas City counterpart's offensive sets during the season, marveling at their intricacies and ingenuity.\n\n\"Every single week they do something where you say, 'That's pretty good,'\" McVay said with an understated smile. \"I'd be lying if I said we haven't stolen some of their stuff this year.\"\n\nMcVay gets a close-up look Monday night in one of the biggest games of the regular season and a possible Super Bowl preview.\n\nThe Chiefs (9-1) are visiting the Rams (9-1) in a game originally scheduled for Mexico City before poor field conditions at Azteca Stadium prompted the NFL to move the game to California on six days' notice.\n\nInstead, the Coliseum will host a meeting of two prolific offenses masterminded by coaches separated by 28 years of age, but shoulder-to-shoulder on the cutting edge of football.\n\n\"He's done a phenomenal job,\" said Reid, a Los Angeles native who lives in Orange County in the offseason. \"He came up through a good system. He's put his own flair to it. He's a smart kid. I am proud of him for the job he's done.\"\n\nTwo offenses averaging 33 points per game have never met this late in a regular season, and the game is only the fifth meeting since 1970 between two one-loss or unbeaten teams in Week 11 or later.\n\nKansas City's Patrick Mahomes leads the NFL in yards passing with Jared Goff in second. The backfields contain Kansas City's Kareem Hunt, last season's NFL rushing champion, and Todd Gurley, the current runaway leader in the category.\n\nOffensive fireworks seem inevitable in a matchup tailor-made for prime time, even if the late venue switch caused logistical hurdles for ESPN . Both teams expressed disappointment about the game being moved out of Mexico City, even though McVay said it was \"clearly the right thing to do\" given the field conditions.\n\n\"We're certainly not going to complain about getting the chance to play at the Coliseum in front of a great atmosphere,\" McVay said.\n\nMore things to watch in the first \"Monday Night Football\" game at the Coliseum since 1985, and the Rams' first in the venerable arena since 1979:\n\nON THE MOVE\n\nThe late change of venue ruined a big night for thousands of Mexican fans and thrilled Rams fans who will get an eighth home game to cheer, but it had little effect on either team's preparation. The Rams planned to spend the week in Colorado Springs to prepare for Mexico City's altitude, and they decided to stay anyway \u2014 partly because several players and coaches wouldn't be able to return to their homes this week because of wildfires surrounding the towns near the Rams' training complex. The Chiefs merely altered their travel plans to take them west instead of south. \"We really haven't had to change much, other than going to a hotel in Los Angeles,\" Reid said.\n\nGETTING HEALTHY\n\nThe Chiefs should have WR Sammy Watkins (foot) and LB Anthony Hitchens (ribs) on the field against the Rams. Neither played last week against Arizona, though Hitchens was active in what Reid called \"an emergency situation.\" Undrafted rookie Ben Niemann got the start in Hitchens' place and performed reasonably well. Watkins is returning to the Coliseum, where he spent last season as the Rams' deep threat before getting a huge free-agent deal with the Chiefs.\n\nMAHOMES MOURNS\n\nMahomes spent part of the week mourning the death of his longtime girlfriend's stepfather. The man had a medical emergency during their game against Arizona last Sunday, and Mahomes learned after leading Kansas City to a 26-14 victory that he had died. The Chiefs were off Tuesday and Wednesday, giving Mahomes time to spend with family, but he did not miss any practice time. \"They've got some things organized and settled down from that side of it,\" Reid said, \"so he can do what he's got to do.\"\n\nOLD FRIENDS\n\nRams CB Marcus Peters spent his first three NFL seasons with Kansas City, making the Pro Bowl twice and establishing himself as an elite defender with 19 interceptions.\n\nBut the Chiefs traded Peters to Los Angeles last offseason, and Reid has been reluctant to talk about why the organization gave up on the talented, occasionally volatile cornerback. Peters has generally played well in LA, although he acknowledged that he struggled two weeks ago when the Rams went up against the NFL's other dominant offense at New Orleans.\n\nThe Rams haven't had any evident problems with Peters off the field, either. \"He's got a good feel for the game,\" McVay said. \"He's passionate about it, and I think that I've been able to learn some things from him and enjoy being around him.\"\n\nPROTECTING PAT\n\nThe Chiefs allowed five sacks last week against Arizona, the first time all season that their hodgepodge offensive line has struggled that much. That's not a good sign when the next opponent has NFL sacks leader Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh on the defensive line.\n\nThe Chiefs have been playing without C Mitch Morse (concussion) and RG Laurent Duvernay-Tardif (broken leg), forcing them to shuffle things around. \"You know,\" Reid said, \"I thought it could be a positive for us. That group hasn't played a bunch together, and so (the Cardinals) did a couple of things in there that will help us down the road here and we can learn from.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Dave Skretta in Kansas City contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Cliff Hawkins, Getty Images)\n\nST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. \u2013 Separated on their birth certificates by 31 years, Davis Love III and Cameron Champ nonetheless walked alongside each other in Thursday\u2019s first round of the RMS Classic at Sea Island Golf Club.\n\nAt the end of 6,907 yards on the Plantation Course, the two were separated by just one spot on the first page of the leaderboard.\n\nOn a windy, chilly day where the thermometer never hit 60, Love, 54 years young and a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, turned in a 5-under-par 67 while Champ, the 23-year-old new kid on the block who is turning heads with his outrageous power, signed for a 68.\n\nPlaying together for the first time, Champ took Love down memory lane to the days he was one of the longest players in the game.\n\n\u201cThat driver, and the 1\u2011iron or whatever his longest iron is, no 3-wood, that was pretty cool because that was me in 1986,\u201d Love said. \u201cThe power is incredible. It's just impressive to see. He hit a couple that were just astounding how far they went. He can flight the ball. He's got a very good short game. You can tell why he's going to be successful.\u201d\n\nThe two were looking up at Charles Howell III, who hit every green and fairway in regulation and toured the Plantation Course in 64 shots to grab a two-shot lead over J.J. Spaun and defending champion Austin Cook, who both played the Plantation Course.\n\nBrian Harmon and Peter Uihlein each shot 4-under-par 66, the lowest score on the Seaside Course, which is the tougher of the two layouts used for the tournament. Joining Love at 67 was Aaron Baddeley.\n\nLove grew up at Sea Island and is the unofficial mayor of the area, where he lives, hosts the RSM Classic, is part-owner of a restaurant, owns a paddle board shop and helps raise millions for charity with his foundation and the tournament. Yet he still makes time to work on his golf game.\n\nThe winner of 21 PGA Tour titles, including the 1997 PGA Championship, knows the golf ball doesn\u2019t know how old he is and believes he can still win on the PGA Tour despite knowing he could try and make hay on the Champions Tour these days.\n\nLove, who had his hip replaced last year, said his time is coming where he\u2019ll move full-time to the Champions Tour, but that time hasn\u2019t arrived just yet.\n\n\u201cI've been hitting the ball pretty well. If I make some putts, I can shoot some good scores, and today I did,\u201d Love said. \u201cI made a couple 20\u2011footers, had a chip-in, made a couple nice par putts for saves and kept the round going.\n\n\u201cI would like a shot at playing a full season without being hurt. I played 16 tournaments last year and 15 the year before combined on both tours, so I haven't really played my normal 23 or 24 or 25 events. I would like to do that this year and just see how I play. If I can play, I'm going to play at least through the (PGA Tour\u2019s) west coast and then kind of make a decision.\u201d\n\nChamp had to change his schedule after he won the Sanderson Farms Championship earlier this year. That victory, his first on the PGA Tour, earned him a spot in the Tournament of Champions in Maui in January and a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour.\n\nAfter making a double-bogey 6 on his first hole when he missed the green with a sand wedge in his hand, Champ turned his round around with four birdies and an eagle in six holes in the middle of his round.\n\n\u201cPrior in my golfing career I probably would have went very south from there, but we had 17 holes and plenty of golf to make it up,\u201d Champ said. \u201cAnd playing with Davis was a lot of fun.

(Photo: Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images)\n\nRainfall from catastrophic hurricanes such as Katrina, Irma and Maria was intensified by human-caused global warming, a new study suggests.\n\nIn fact, the Earth's warming climate increased the rainfall by as much as 9 percent, and could cause up to 30 percent more rainfall in storms of the future, study authors said.\n\n\"We're already starting to see (human-caused) factors influencing tropical cyclone rainfall,\" said study lead author Christina Patricola, a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \"And our simulations strongly indicate that as time goes on, we can expect to see even greater increases in rainfall,\" she said.\n\nUsing computer models, researchers simulated how 15 historically destructive hurricanes and typhoons would develop in pre-industrial, modern, and future climates. The study found that human-caused climate change significantly increased rainfall from those three storms, but did not boost their wind speed.\n\nFuture storms, however, will see increases in both rainfall and wind speed, the study said. Specifically, if the climate continues to warm, peak wind speeds could increase by as much as 29 mph.\n\n\"Scientists are coming to a consensus that global warming will lead to increases in rainfall from tropical cyclones,\" Patricola said. \"One of the remaining uncertainties is how much.\"\n\nMaria hit Puerto Rico and other parts of the Caribbean in 2017, killing as many as 3,000 people. Irma hit the Caribbean and Florida that same year, while Katrina struck New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, leaving over 1,800 dead.\n\nA separate study that dealt with 2017's Hurricane Harvey said the city's topography increased rainfall totals, which included some of the nation's most extreme rains ever recorded.\n\nFirst, the city's skyscrapers increased atmospheric drag, leading to heavier rainfall. Second, the rock-hard city surface increased flooding, probably due to the extensive concrete and asphalt coverage.\n\nThe studies were published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/15/global-warming-boosted-rainfall-recent-hurricanes-study-suggests/2016646002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Titans keep opposing QBs guessing with defensive changes", "description": "Titans keep opposing QBs guessing with defensive changes, lead the lead in scoring defense", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/15/titans-keep-opposing-qbs-guessing-with-defensive-changes/38538467/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/853984a7c10e42037b869b5f135f2b152d454b71/c=0-246-3655-2302/local/-/media/2018/11/15/USATODAY/usatsports/6301a92ab3c048ca8a9b37cc6467c78e.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:31:11Z", "content": "FILE - In this Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018 file photo, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, center, is sacked by a group of Tennessee Titans defenders in the second half of an NFL football game in Nashville, Tenn.

Figuring out where the Titans are coming from defensively these days means a lot of film study, and not even that helps the way defensive coordinator Dean Pees has them lining up and switching responsibilities. (AP Photo/Mark Zaleski, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Figuring out where the Titans are coming from defensively requires a lot of film study, and that might not even be enough to solve the riddle.\n\nDefensive coordinator Dean Pees has consistently changed where players line up and seems to be constantly switching their responsibilities.\n\nLinebacker Wesley Woodyard said it's easy to see on game tape just how much Tennessee is confusing opponents.\n\n\"Some of the looks we give quarterbacks, you can clearly see once you watch film that they're confused, don't know where the blitz is coming from, don't know which defensive system we're in, so it's cool man to keep that mixed-up look for the offense to keep them off balance,\" Woodyard said.\n\nRookie coach Mike Vrabel talked about how the Titans would show multiple looks on defense after being hired in January. So did Pees.\n\nNow the Titans (5-4) are putting all that talk into results on the field where they lead the NFL in scoring defense, allowing just 16.8 points per game. They're also first inside the red zone, allowing touchdowns on only 34.8 percent of opponents' possessions.\n\nThe Titans also have not allowed more than 23 points in eight straight games, the longest streak in the NFL this season. It's the longest such streak for this franchise since the first 10 games of the 2008 season and faces a stern test Sunday when the Titans visit Andrew Luck and the Colts (4-5).\n\nPees said Thursday he believes the Titans are getting better and getting more comfortable with how he changes up defenses from week to week, even if the changes aren't much different.\n\n\"I think they understand now kind of the philosophy what Mike wants, what I want, what we want, and that's being multiple in the front, being multiple in the back end, disguise things,\" Pees said. \"I think they're starting to feel comfortable with that, comfortable with the philosophy of how we're going to attack the teams.\"\n\nLinebacker Brian Orakpo said the Titans now see exactly what Vrabel was talking about when he talked about multiplicity for the defense.\n\n\"Rather than just talking about it and putting it on the whiteboard, we can actually play on Sundays and distribute what we learn, and it shows,\" Orakpo said. \"We turn on the film, and guys are flying around. Quarterbacks don't know what to do with the ball. It's just satisfying to see when things start working.\"\n\nMaking all that work requires players buying in and doing the studying, especially when they need to slide over to spots they might not normally play.\n\n\"Sometimes I'm over the center, sometimes I'm on the edge,\" Orakpo said. \"We're all over the place. (Defensive lineman Jurrell) Casey may be on the edge, inside we got a linebacker blitzing in the middle, outside we got people all over the place. We got nickel Logan (Ryan) coming all the time now in certain situations. You have to know multiple positions to kind of make this defense thrive, which we're doing so far.\"\n\nThe Titans finished last season 17th in points allowed in Dick LeBeau's final season as defensive coordinator.\n\nSo far, the Titans also rank sixth in total yards, tied for 10th in rushing and sixth in passing yards allowed even with some key starters missing games to injuries. Linebacker Derrick Morgan has missed the last three games with an injured shoulder. Woodyard was out the first two games in October with an injured shoulder. Safety Kenny Vaccaro missed all three October games.\n\n\"It's definitely fun,\" Orakpo said. \"It keeps the offense and quarterbacks on their toes, and we can just go out there and make plays.\"\n\nNotes: RT Jack Conklin (concussion protocol) practiced fully for the first time since being hurt in Dallas on Nov. 5.

Golden defeated Poliquin for the 2nd District Congressional seat in the 2018 midterm election. (Photo: Robert F. Bukaty, AP)\n\nSeveral Republican House incumbents lost tight races in the 2018 midterm election, but Maine's two-term Rep. Bruce Poliquin did so in historical fashion.\n\nPoliquin's Democratic challenger Jared Golden was declared the winner Thursday in the first federal election in U.S. history to be decided by a \"ranked-choice\" voting system.\n\nPoliquin was also the first incumbent to lose the seat in more than 100 years, The Associated Press reported. His loss flips another Republican House seat to the Democrats and leaves Maine Sen. Susan Collins as the lone Republican in Congress from New England.\n\nPoliquin narrowly got the most votes on Election Day \u2013 with 46.1 percent to Golden's 45.9 \u2013 but because he didn't get more than 50 percent of the vote, Maine's new law kicked in. Independent candidates Tiffany Bond and William Hoar combined received about another 8 percent of the vote.\n\nIn the new system, approved by Maine voters in 2016, a person votes for their favorite candidate and ranks the other candidates by their order of preference. If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, the last-place candidate gets knocked out and the ballots cast for them are reallocated based on an algorithm that factors the voters' preferences. That process continues until one candidate has a majority.\n\nAfter the votes were adjusted, Poliquin, 65, lost his lead in what had been a four-way race on Election Day and the 36-year-old Golden was declared the winner.\n\nMaine is the first state to use ranked-choice voting in a statewide election, the Portland Press Herald reported, although some cities use similar systems. Some other countries, including Australia and Ireland, also use variations of ranked-choice. Maine used the system in the state's June primaries.\n\nPoliquin filed a lawsuit asking for a halt in the ranked-choice tabulation, arguing it is unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker declined Poliquin\u2019s request to stop the count on Thursday morning. But he did not definitively rule on the constitutionality of the law, leaving open the possibility that it could still be overturned and Poliquin declared the winner.\n\n\"It is now officially clear I won the constitutional 'one-person, one-vote' first choice election on Election Day that has been used in Maine for more than one hundred years,\" Poliquin said in a statement. \"We will proceed with our constitutional concerns about the rank vote algorithm.\"\n\nGolden was confident he would overcome Poliquin's legal challenge and told reporters Thursday that he is the \"majority consensus winner.\" The Marine Corps veteran vowed to work with Republicans to get things done in Washington rather than focus on investigations into the Trump administration. He also said he would not vote for current House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for House Speaker.\n\nThird-party and independent candidates often get a lot of votes in Maine. The state's voters approved ranked-choice voting in a referendum after nine of the previous 11 governors were elected without a majority of the vote.\n\nFor now, the ranked-choice voting system is used only in federal races and in statewide primary elections. It can't be used in the governor\u2019s race or state legislative races because the state constitution explicitly says the winners in those races are determined by a plurality of the vote.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Janet Mills, who won her primary with the ranked-counting system, has said she will try to amend Maine\u2019s constitution so the system can be used in all elections.\n\nContributing: Beth McEvoy, WCSH-TV, Portland, Maine; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/15/election-2018-rep-bruce-poliquin-loses-maine-race-jared-golden/2014423002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Dalvin Brown, USA TODAY", "title": "Facebook vs. Apple feud: Social networking site calls out Tim Cook by name", "description": "The tech titans are clashing.

The first-year play-caller understands the abundance of options he has while guiding one of the league's most potent offenses. Yet he's also installed a bit of an old-school approach when the Steelers get close to the end zone. More runs. Fewer passes. More big guys doing what big guys do best: pushing players in opposing jerseys out of the way.\n\nThe results have been startling. Pittsburgh has turned a league-high 78 percent (22 of 28) of its red zone opportunities into touchdown celebrations, one of the main reasons the streaking Steelers (6-2-1) are on pace to set a franchise record in points.\n\nIt's a stark departure from Todd Haley's productive if occasionally volatile six-year tenure as offensive coordinator, when Pittsburgh had no trouble piling up yards but would often bog down with the goal line in sight. The Steelers finished between 12th and 18th in red zone efficiency during Haley's run, one of the reasons the team opted to go in another direction in the offseason when it fired him and replaced him with Fichtner.\n\nFichtner was given a mandate from ownership to put up more points, and Fichtner has taken a decidedly collaborative approach to making it happen, whether if it's giving quarterback Ben Roethlisberger more freedom calling plays or picking the brain of offensive line coach Mike Munchak and assistant Shaun Sarrett to see what might work best when space gets tight.\n\n\"Coach Randy has been really good in the sense that 'Hey, Munch, what do you want to do? What's best in this situation?'\" left guard Ramon Foster said. \"We all know that Munch is a guy that understands and knows the run. He and Randy have been putting us in really good position to run the ball in too. I say their communication is really high.\"\n\nHaving a running back who seems to embrace the dirty work required near the end zone helps. James Conner set an Atlantic Coast Conference record for touchdowns during his remarkable college career at Pittsburgh. He moved next door after the Steelers drafted him in the third round of the 2017 draft and was thrust into the starter's roll when two-time All-Pro Le'Veon Bell decided to sit out the season rather than sign his one-year franchise tender.\n\nAll Conner has done in his first nine games is score 11 touchdowns, 10 of them on the ground and seven of them on runs from inside the opponent 5. Bell never scored more than nine rushing touchdowns in a season and scored 18 rushing touchdowns total on carries inside the 5 during his five seasons with the Steelers.\n\nThe issue for Bell wasn't necessarily production but opportunities. Bell never had more than seven rushing attempts inside the 5 in a single season. Conner already has 11. Roethlisberger ranked second in the NFL in red zone pass attempts inside the 10 in 2017. He's 15th this season because rather than throw it, he's turning around to hand it off.\n\n\"I think it's been a shift,\" wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said. \"When you have a new offensive coordinator he's going to emphasize some things that he feels like needs to change. I think the past 3-4 years we haven't been great in the red zone. So having that run element has been good but also having (tight end) Vance (McDonald) healthy, having others guys healthy allows us to expand more and do different things and get teams in different personnel so we can run the ball.\"\n\nAnd still throw it when necessary. Roethlisberger threw five touchdowns to five different receivers in last week's 52-21 dismantling of Carolina, three of them coming from 12 yards or less.\n\n\"We got a lot of guys that can make plays in this offense and coach Randy is finding a way to get that done,\" Foster said. \"Whether it's him calling or whether it's Ben calling, we're finding a way to get it done.\"\n\nEven if finding a way means simply looking at the talent at your disposal and try to avoid the temptation to get cute.\n\n\"Sometimes you overthink it,\" Heyward-Bey said. \"Sometimes you're trying to game plan, 'Oh this worked for another team, so let's try it.' Sometimes you've just got to play hard-nosed football and I think that's what we've been trying to do. We throw a couple tricks here and there, but we're just going to try and come downhill and try to score.\"\n\nNOTES: RT Marcus Gilbert (knee) and DE Stephon Tuitt (elbow) did not practice on Thursday. ...

DeSantis prevailed in a statewide recount Thursday to make his victory official. (Photo: Phelan M. Ebenhack, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Andrew Gillum will have to rely on the courts if he has any chance to become Florida's first black governor.\n\nA recount of more than 8 million ballots that ended Thursday afternoon confirmed that Republican Ron DeSantis beat the Democratic Tallahassee mayor in the nationally watched race that galvanized progressives across the country.\n\nThe final tally, headed to certification next week, was 4,075,445 for DeSantis and 4,041,762 for Gillum.\n\nThe margin of victory was enough for DeSantis, a former congressman representing Jacksonville, to avoid a hand recount of questionable ballots set aside for further review. He had already assembled a transition team to prepare for his ascendance as Florida's 46th governor.\n\nBut Gillum is not conceding. He and his supporters believe there is still a path to victory: lawsuits that could add more votes in support of him.\n\n\u201cA vote denied is justice denied \u2014 the State of Florida must count every legally cast vote,\" Gillum said in a statement after the recount totals were released. \"As today\u2019s unofficial reports and recent court proceedings make clear, there are tens of thousands of votes that have yet to be counted. We plan to do all we can to ensure that every voice is heard in this process. Voters need to know that their decision to participate in this election, and every election, matters. It is not over until every legally casted vote is counted.\u201d\n\nThe deadline for the recount was 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time Thursday but Palm Beach County, a Democratic stronghold, did not complete its recount. It was the only one of Florida's 67 counties that failed to do so. A lawsuit filed by Democrats could find more votes for Gillum there, for example.\n\nAfter Election Day, DeSantis, led Gillum by fewer than 34,000 votes or a margin of .409 percent. At the time, the race was one of three under a statewide mandated recount. Margins in the Senate and state's agriculture commissioner were also under the half-percent margin needed to automatically trigger a machine recount.\n\nAfter the recount, the margin barely changed.\n\nGillum, 39, had attracted a national following as he sought to make history.\n\nPotential 2020 presidential candidates Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., campaigned for him and he was often featured on national news shows after he scored an unexpected win in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in August.\n\nBut he was continually dogged by ethical issues, including his acceptance of tickets to the hit Broadway show \"Hamilton,\" a lavish trip to Costa Rica with lobbyist pals, and a fundraiser underwritten by an undercover FBI agent.\n\nThe victory by DeSantis, 40, who is an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, keeps the governor's mansion in GOP hands, where it has been since 1999.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/15/florida-recount-ron-desantis-prevails-over-andrew-gillum-governor/2006942002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No goal for Wayne Rooney in 120th, final England appearance", "description": "Wayne Rooney couldn't raise his England scoring record in a 120th and final appearance as a new generation of players provided the goals in a 3-0 victory over the United States on Thursday", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/11/15/no-goal-for-wayne-rooney-in-120th-final-england-appearance/38538311/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1a2df851cdf614a1c9b81d1826b3c9fc5c22bda4/c=0-285-5472-3363/local/-/media/2018/11/15/USATODAY/usatsports/16dcf1237e1c465b908e1db70892491c.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:09:13Z", "content": "England's Wayne Rooney, right, tries to pass Unites States Matt Miazga, left, during the international friendly soccer match between England and the United States at Wembley stadium, Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018.

When the old main was taken out of service, a regulator station sensed the loss of pressure and pumped more gas into the line.\n\nPressures spiked to 12 times normal, and houses began exploding.\n\nA Columbia Gas control room in Columbus, Ohio noticed the pressure spike within minutes. But after an unexplained change in process four years ago, the utility no longer puts technicians in place to monitor pressures on the ground \u2014 and to respond to an over-pressure event by manually shutting off the gas, the NTSB said.\n\nThe utility said Thursday it was reviewing the board's recommendations but is already implementing some safety measures.\n\nOne such move: A $150 million plan to install \"slam-shut\" over-pressurization protection devices on low-pressure pipelines to automatically shut down gas when high pressures are detected.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/15/ntsb-recommendations-columbia-gas-massachusetts-explosions-pipelines-nisource/2015618002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "It's The Big Three and Joey Logano in NASCAR's title race", "description": "NASCAR's championship as expected will be between Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Martin Truex Jr. as The Big Three advanced to the finale", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2018/11/15/its-the-big-three-and-joey-logano-in-nascars-title-race/38538233/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f15a3455dc807565a762b115abf91bbbcdcc57f0/c=0-126-3036-1834/local/-/media/2018/11/15/USATODAY/usatsports/72617c13ba254d9bbc12db80ec855b59.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:56:36Z", "content": "FILE - In this May 19, 2018, file photo, Joey Logano looks from the garage after practice for the NASCAR All-Star auto race at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C.

The others are Kevin Harvick, Kyle Busch and Martin Truex Jr. (AP Photo/Terry Renna, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Martin Truex Jr. sat on a bench, scrolling through their phones , oblivious to their surroundings and the stakes.\n\nJoey Logano was a room away, mingling in the back of a ballroom, grinning ear-to-ear and totally at ease.\n\n\"It's the Big Three and me,\" Logano shrugged. \"I might be the underdog in the stats standpoint, but we sure don't feel like we are.\"\n\nLogano is the outcast, statistically and socially, of Sunday's championship field. He wasn't picked to advance to the Homestead-Miami Speedway finale but he's part of the championship party because he used his bumper to move Truex out of his way and win at Martinsville Speedway.\n\nThat victory put Logano in the finale, where the so-called Big Three were always supposed to be, and Logano is seemingly just along for the ride.\n\nBut he doesn't view it that way and thinks this championship might be his to lose.\n\n\"You have to have that confidence,\" Logano said. \"I feel like our team is in a great spot. We're ready to get to Sunday and see what happens.\"\n\nNASCAR shipped the four title contenders off to New York City this week for a full day of promotional activities, then brought them together Thursday for the opening of championship weekend. They had lunch together, filmed a segment on the beach for \"The Today Show,\" then previewed the title race in a posh South Beach hotel.\n\nIt hardly made for a tense or dramatic lead-in to what is expected to be the most competitive championship race since this playoff format was launched in 2014. Harvick won the 2014 title, Busch grabbed the crown in 2015 and Truex is the defending series champion. The trio combined to win 20 of 35 points races this season, while Logano has two victories but had the steadiest playoff run.\n\nAsked Thursday if this is the most competitive four-driver finale since the format launched in 2014, it was Harvick who noted it actually isn't much different than last season when The Big Three raced against Logano teammate Brad Keselowski.\n\n\"It's the same four organizations from last year,\" Harvick said.\n\n\"It just depends on if Joey is a better driver than Brad,\" Truex added.\n\n\"They both run into you a lot,\" Busch continued.\n\nLogano smartly closed the subject: \"It's best if I keep my mouth shut on this one,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, the most interesting thing to emerge from NASCAR's championship preview day was the confusion on how Logano and Truex plan to race each other Sunday. Truex had vowed not to let Logano win the championship after Logano moved him out of the way last month at Martinsville. Forced to spend the better part of two days together as a group, Logano and Truex at one point apparently discussed the situation.\n\nTheir interpretation of that conversation now differs as Truex claims he'd \"absolutely\" move Logano out of his way to win the championship.\n\n\"I have a free pass. He already told me I could. He told me he's fair game. So here we go,\" Truex said.\n\nLogano recalled the talk differently.\n\n\"I didn't tell him that. I said 'Hey, I expect to get raced the way I race people,'\" Logano said. \"I'm a hard racer. I expect to get raced hard. I said it before, we didn't crash each other. I didn't crash him. Moved him up enough to have a drag race. That's what I explained to him.\"\n\nNo matter how it plays out, the four title contenders expect to control the race Sunday in a thrilling push to the winner-take-all Cup championship. Since the elimination format was introduced in 2014, the champion has won Homestead to win the title every year.\n\n\"I think there's about a 99 percent chance that one of these guys is going to win (the race) to win the championship,\" Truex said. \"That's what you come down here prepared for as a group, as a team, as a driver, and that's your goal coming here to win, and then you can guarantee yourself a championship.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Charles Howell III had an advantage of playing the right course for the cold, windy conditions Thursday at the RSM Classic. He made the most of it with a game so complete that he never played from the rough and had a birdie putt on every hole.\n\nHowell bundled up from the cold and shot 8-under 64 on the Plantation course at Sea Island Resort, giving a two-shot lead to par in the opening round of the final PGA Tour event of the calendar year.\n\nHowell was two shots ahead of defending champion Austin Cook and J.J. Spaun, who were at 6-under 66 on the Plantation course. Tournament host Davis Love III had two bogeys and still managed a 67 at Plantation.\n\nThe Seaside course, where the final two rounds are held, is more exposed to the wind. The best score at Seaside belonged to Brian Harman and Peter Uihlein, who each had at a 4-under 66.\n\n\"I was awfully glad I was on Plantation and not Seaside,\" Howell said. \"But someone just told me that I hit every fairway and every green, so I can't think of the last time I've done that. I think sometimes playing these difficult conditions, it forces you to stay a bit more present. It's hard to get too far ahead of yourself because of the difficulty of every shot coming.\"\n\nHe finished strong by two-putting for birdie on the 16th from about 20 feet, and finishing with a birdie on the par-5 18th.\n\nThe difference in courses, especially in such weather conditions, reminded him of Torrey Pines, where players used to shoot low on the North Course and hang on for dear life on the South Course. That's one reason Howell wasn't thinking too far ahead of trying to win for the first time since 2007 at Riviera, 332 starts ago.\n\n\"There's plenty of golf left,\" he said.\n\nUihlein, the former U.S. Amateur champion, sounded just as pleased with his 66. The wind is stronger on Seaside, and temperature felt about 10 degrees colder. Judging how far the ball goes in cold weather is tough enough, even more when the wind is blowing.\n\n\"I just kept the ball in play,\" Uihlein said. \"When it's this windy and this tough, just being able to get it off the tee and having a chance to hit the green ... you're not going to blitz it. You're not trying to do anything to really kind of mess it up.\"\n\nCameron Champ, the 23-year-old rookie who won in Mississippi last month in his second start as a PGA Tour member, opened with a double bogey on Plantation. He atoned for that with one of his big tee shots that led to eagle on the par-5 18th. He wound up with a 4-under 68. Patton Kizzire, one of several players who live at Sea Island, looked as though he would fail to take advantage of being on the Plantation until he closed with four straight birdies for a 68.\n\nHowell long memories of Sea Island, where he briefly lived, and he feels somewhat of a spiritual connection to its roots.\n\nHe grew up in Augusta, and Sea Island was a popular getaway for golf as a junior. Howell was 9 when his father arranged for a getaway to Sea Island to get lessons from one of the pros, Jimmy Hodges. A week before he was to arrive, Hodges was on the small plane with Davis Love Jr. and John Popa when it crashed near Jacksonville and killed all three pros and the pilot.\n\n\"I was actually lucky enough last year to meet Jimmy's wife,\" Howell said. \"She came out and watched me play a few holes and then brought the story up. I knew I knew it, I didn't know that she knew it. ... We've been coming down here for quite a bit.\"\n\nHowell would love to add another chapter to his times at Sea Island, this time posing with the trophy. It's been a long time for him, a point driven home a year ago when he received a text message from the PGA Tour congratulating him on his 500th career start.\n\nEven more amazing to Howell is that he turns 40 next summer.\n\nLove is 54 and still not ready to abandon playing the PGA Tour. He knew he needed a good week with his putter, and he got that Thursday with seven birdies. He heads to Seaside on Friday with high hopes for his game and the weather.\n\n\"The sun will be out, and it will be a much nicer day,\" Love said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., introduced in the Senate on Wednesday. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., introduced a similar bill in the House. Rubio and Smith are co-chairs of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.\n\nThe legislation asks the State Department to consider targeted sanctions for individuals responsible for alleged human rights abuses in China. It also asks for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to submit an interagency report on the number of persons detained in the camps, camp conditions, and the number who are arbitrarily detained, among other stipulations.\n\nRubio and Smith's calls for sanctions comes two months after they urged the Trump administration in September to sanction the Chinese government, as well as any private companies engaged in or complicit with the human rights violations in China\u2019s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. They said the Chinese government has created a \u201chigh-tech police state\u201d in XUAR that allows for widespread, intrusive spying on citizens there.\n\n\u201cThe United States must hold accountable officials in the Chinese government and Communist Party responsible for gross violations of human rights and possible crimes against humanity, including the internment in \u2018political re-education\u2019 camps of as many as a million Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim minorities,\u201d Rubio said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThis picture taken on Sept. 17, 2014, shows young Uighurs resting near the Grand Bazaar in Urumqi. Xinjiang is home to some 10 million of China's Muslim Uighur minority. (Photo: AFP, Getty Images)\n\nSen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called China\u2019s treatment of its Muslim minority \u201cbeyondabhorrent\u201d and called for action from President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe President needs to have a clear and consistent approach to China, and not turn a blind eye as a million Muslims are unjustly imprisoned and forced into labor camps by an autocratic regime,\u201d Menendez said in a statement.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the agency cannot comment on prospective sanctions investigations but that they are considering \u201ctargeted measures against Xinjiang officials.\u201d\n\n\"We remain alarmed that since April 2017, the Chinese government has detained an estimated 800,000 to possibly more than two million Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims in political re-education camps,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe United States will continue to call on China to end these counterproductive policies and free all those arbitrarily detained. The Secretary spoke about this issue, in no uncertain terms, alongside his Chinese counterpart at the Diplomatic and Security Dialogue on November 9.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has previously raised the issue of Muslim persecution in China during an address to religious conservatives and in an op-ed in USA TODAY in July, but he has not said what other actions the State Department might take against China.\n\nAt a Nov. 9 news briefing in Washington with Chinese Politburo Member Yang Jiechi, and Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister Gen. Wei Fenghe, Pompeo said that he discussed with his Chinese counterparts how \u201cwe hope the Chinese will treat their religious minorities.\u201d\n\nAt a news briefing Wednesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying accused the lawmakers of being \u201ctoo obsessed with poking their noses in the domestic affairs of others\u201d and blamed the U.S. for \u201csystematic racial discrimination\u201d among its own minority groups.\n\n\u201cIt is really a wonder to me that these lawmakers think they are so superior that they can point fingers at other countries\u2019 domestic affairs,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have been extending their long arms to meddle in other countries\u2019 domestic affairs based on misinformation and strong ideological bias.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Hua again objected to other countries meddling in China\u2019s domestic affairs after being asked about a letter from 15 Western ambassadors in Beijing that raised concerns over the country\u2019s alleged human rights abuses against minority Muslims and requested a meeting with top Chinese officials.\n\n\"An ambassador is supposed to promote the mutual understanding, mutual trust and cooperation between the receiving state and the sending state, rather than raise unreasonable requests and interfere in the internal affairs of the receiving state based on hearsay,\" Hua said.\n\nReuters reported Thursday that the letter was signed by ambassadors from Canada, Great Britain, France, Switzerland, the European Union, Germany and Australia, among others.\n\nMore: China's tiny Muslim community provokes giant anti-Islam backlash\n\nMore: Amnesty International calls on China to end campaign forcing mostly Muslims into 're-education camps'\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/15/china-diplomats-congress-muslim-persecution-rubio-uighur/2010636002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Batshuayi double helps Belgium beat Iceland 2-0", "description": "Michy Batshuayi scored twice as Belgium beat Iceland 2-0 to maintain its 100 percent record in the inaugural UEFA Nations League", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/11/15/batshuayi-double-helps-belgium-beat-iceland-2-0/38538107/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/77e6f545f1ce38eba8a12538c5bc9718201767f6/c=0-478-1429-1282/local/-/media/2018/11/15/USATODAY/usatsports/ac365e98e8894f4eb8ba8540b36e7b18.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:50:14Z", "content": "Belgium's Youri Tielemans, left, goes up agains Iceland's Arnor Sigurdsson during the UEFA Nations League soccer match between Belgium and Iceland at the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels, Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018.

WXIA\n\nTexas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke at a campaign rally in San Antonio (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Can candidates win while losing?\n\nSome of the Democratic stars of the midterms did not prevail in their elections. Beto O'Rourke returned to Washington on Tuesday not as the senator-elect from Texas but as the retiring congressman from El Paso. Andrew Gillum officially lost his bid to be Florida governor after a recount. And Stacey Abrams had hoped to force a runoff with Secretary of State Brian Kemp in the Georgia governor's race but conceded on Friday,\n\nTraditionally, a campaign is a zero-sum game. One person wins, the other loses. But in an age of social media, at a time of hunger for authentic voices and amid a wide-open debate about the future message and messengers of the Democratic Party, it's possible that even a losing candidate could emerge as a rising voice.\n\nConsider this: The Polk County Democratic Party in Iowa issued an open invitation last week to O'Rourke to visit the biggest county in the state that just happens to hold the opening presidential caucuses.\n\n\"People wanted us to start inviting him in September,\" says Polk County Democratic chairman Sean Bagniewski. \"We started seeing Beto stickers in Iowa; we're seeing yard signs for Beto in Iowa.\" Could he be a credible presidential contender for 2020? \"Absolutely,\" he says.\n\n\"It worked for Abraham Lincoln,\" political scientist Darrell West of the Brookings Institution says with a smile. Lincoln was elected to a single House term from Illinois in 1846 and then lost a bid for the Senate in 1858, but he still managed to win the presidency in 1860. Among this year's candidates, win or lose, \"some of these individuals certainly made a name for themselves, developed a national following and have a large fundraising base,\" West notes. O'Rourke in particular \"could actually end up being very well-positioned for a presidential race.\"\n\nTo be sure, not everyone agrees with that. O'Rourke is a three-term House member from the northwest corner of Texas, not well known even within the state when he decided to challenge Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. O'Rourke has never won statewide office or been the chief sponsor of significant legislation that became law. In January, he'll be out of work.\n\nYet by Election Day, after following a strategy that eschewed much of the conventional wisdom about how to run a campaign, O'Rourke managed to raise a record-breaking $70 million from more than 800,000 individuals and to finish within 2.6 percentage points of Cruz. That's the closest any Democratic candidate has come to winning statewide office in Texas in nearly a quarter-century.\n\nThe energy around his candidacy is credited with helping Democrats down the Texas ballot flip two Republican-held House seats and more than dozen seats in the state Legislature.\n\nNot only in horseshoes\n\nClose counts only in horseshoes, the adage goes. (Even in horseshoes, ringers count more.) For candidates who brave long-shot races, though, near-misses can also help launch political careers.\n\nOne reason Abrams, Gillum and O'Rourke have generated so much buzz is that they didn't start out as likely winners. Indeed, the conventional wisdom at the start saw them as sure losers. Texas and Georgia have been reliably red states, for one thing, resistant to electing Democrats to statewide office.\n\nFlorida is a swing state, but Gillum wasn't favored in the five-way Democratic primary last August. Congresswoman Gwen Graham was better known, with a famous last name: Her father, Bob Graham, is a beloved figure who had served as governor and senator. Businessman Jeff Greene had more money, much of it tapped from his own fortune. Philip Levine was the former mayor of Miami Beach, a more muscular political base than Gillum's post as mayor of Tallahassee.\n\nGillum and Abrams also were trying to break new ground in racial and gender politics, which can be a perilous endeavor. When he won the Florida primary, Gillum became the first African-American nominated for governor by a major party in the history of the state. When she won the Georgia primary, Abrams became the first African-American woman to be a major party's nominee for governor in the history of the nation.\n\nAll three of them ran campaigns that rejected the traditional prescription of edging to the center to appeal to moderates in the middle. They tried to persuade new, progressive voters to go to the polls rather than simply court more reliable and centrist ones. Comparing them with the past two Democratic presidents, they followed more in the mold of Barack Obama in 2008 than Bill Clinton in 1992. They targeted the rising elements of the American electorate: millennials, blacks, Hispanics, women.\n\nThat paid off in turnout. Exit polls of voters sponsored by CNN and other media organizations reported that turnout among nonwhites hit records for a midterm election in all three states: 34 percent in Florida, 40 percent in Georgia, 41 percent in Texas. Those voters overwhelmingly backed the Democratic candidates over their Republican opponents \u2013 Ron DeSantis in Florida, Brian Kemp in Georgia and Cruz in Texas. Abrams and O'Rourke both won among voters who were casting a ballot for the first time in a midterm election by 7 percentage points; Gillum carried that group by a yawning 16 points.\n\nAnd they didn't flinch at being labeled liberals.\n\nCLOSE Beto O'Rourke dropped the f-bomb during his emotional concession speech after losing to Senator Ted Cruz. USA TODAY\n\nGillum was endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, backed a Medicare-for-all health care system and proposed raising the corporate tax rate to fund education programs. Abrams emphasized her pragmatism but also made it clear she supported gun control, gay rights and access to abortion. Tackling a hot-button issue that some Southern politicians have skirted, she called for the giant relief carving of Confederate figures on the state's Stone Mountain to be removed.\n\nO'Rourke refused to accept contributions from political action committees and declined to hire a pollster or to employ high-priced consultants. He visited all 254 counties in Texas, including those where Democrats are scarce, and he tracked on Facebook everything from meeting with voters to doing his laundry.\n\nAt a Houston town hall in August, he was asked whether the decision by NFL players to kneel during the national anthem was disrespectful to veterans. \"My short answer is no, I don't think it's disrespectful,\" he began, then earnestly discussed the history of the civil rights movement in America. There is \"nothing more American than to peacefully stand up, or take a knee, for your rights, anytime, anywhere, or any place,\" he said.\n\nCruz seized the response for an emotional TV attack ad that aired in Texas, where most voters disagreed with O'Rourke on the issue. Across the country, though, the video of the exchange went viral, viewed tens of millions of times and fueling his status as a politician to watch.\n\nYoung enough to run again\n\nThere's one more factor that has boosted speculation about the futures of Abrams, Gillum and O'Rourke: their ages. Abrams is 44 years old. Gillum is 39. O'Rourke is 46. That gives them time to run again down the road.\n\nThe power of Facebook and Twitter also may make it less critical to hold the platform of an elective office, argues Nina Turner, president of the progressive group Our Revolution. \"You can still have a big megaphone in the 21st century because of social media,\" she says. \"Anybody can be a rising star.\"\n\nAbrams should consider challenging Republican Sen. David Perdue for re-election in 2020, says Donna Brazile, who ran Al Gore's presidential bid in 2000 and has led the Democratic National Committee. \"She's got the infrastructure ready,\" Brazile says. Abrams spokeswoman Priyanka Mantha demurs it's too early to consider that, or another else. \"The job she is currently vying for is governor of Georgia, and that is what we're focused on now,\" she says.\n\nBrazile suggests O'Rourke could be a possible leader at the DNC, a perch that would give him a day job and political prominence. Jim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, says O'Rourke would be well-positioned to challenge Republican Sen. John Cornyn in two years. O'Rourke aides said they doubt he'd be interested in the Senate race.\n\n\"The loss is bitter,\" O'Rourke said in a long email to supporters, saying he wanted to \"be part of the best way forward for this country.\" He closed: \"See you down the road.\"\n\nDown the road, there's another race in 2020 that may hold more appeal.\n\nFor the White House.\n\nIn a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll in the days immediately after the election, former Vice President Joe Biden had the most support from Democrats as a potential presidential nominee in 2020, at 26 percent. Bernie Sanders, who made a surprisingly strong bid for the nomination last time around, was second, at 19 percent.\n\nBeto O'Rourke was third, in single digits but ahead of such prospects as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.\n\nWhen House Democrats met on Wednesday for the first time since the election, there were rounds of applause for three representatives who had won governorships, in Colorado, Minnesota and New Mexico. Applause for two who won Senate seats, in Arizona and Nevada. Applause for a congressman who won another statewide race, as attorney general of Minnesota.\n\nAnd applause for Beto O'Rourke, who lost.

That makes it two consecutive winners of the award traded by the Marlins last offseason, with Yelich joining 2017 MVP Giancarlo Stanton, now with the New York Yankees.\n\nThe trades were part of a payroll purge and rebuilding effort under the ownership, and Jeter said he understands why the deals might make the franchise a target of derision.\n\n\"I get it. It's a complicated history,\" he said. \"I understand that sometimes we take the blame for what has happened here in the past. We have to prove that wrong.\n\n\"We want to win. That's the bottom line. It's about 25 guys on our team; it's not about one particular player. We have to take the time to build that organization.\"\n\nWith the focus on accumulating prospects, All-Star catcher J.T. Realmuto could be the next to go, and the Marlins are shopping him this offseason.\n\nWhile the payroll will likely be small again in 2019, the team can at least tout a new look. The old orange is out, and blue, black, red and gray are the new colors. The logo features a darting marlin above baseball seams and \"Miami\" in script.\n\nThe Marlins said they chose colors found in the large variety of cultural flags flown in South Florida. They said the script was influenced by typography commonly found in Latin-American culture, with a font style and accent colors reminiscent of the 1950s Miami Marlins minor league team, as well as the Havana Sugar Kings of the same era.\n\nJeter, the team's CEO, had input on the designs.\n\n\"We tried to capture the energy and diversity of Miami,\" he said. \"We listened to our fans. We took a lot of time looking around Miami. We've done Miami's colors.\"\n\nWith the changes, the franchise further distances itself from the unpopular former owner, Jeffrey Loria. He changed the colors and logo when the Marlins moved into a new ballpark in 2012.\n\n\"We want to put our own mark on the organization,\" Jeter said. \"It differentiates the past with the present and the future. It was important for us to do this.\"\n\nChanges at Marlins Park are also being made. The kitschy home run sculpture has been dismantled and will be replaced by a tiered standing room-only area for spectators. In another section, fans will be invited to bring musical instruments, bells, whistles and flags as a way to show pride in their native countries.\n\n\"We're hopeful when they walk into the park next year, it's an entirely different experience for them,\" Jeter said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Amy Olson had a simple explanation for her brilliant start at the CME Group Tour Championship.\n\n\"I don't have any bad memories,\" she said.\n\nPlaying the LPGA's season-ending event for the first time, Olson was flawless with nine birdies and no dropped shots on her way to a 9-under 63 and a one-shot lead over Brittany Lincicome and Nasa Hataoka after Thursday's opening round.\n\nOlson had two separate streaks of four consecutive birdies on what became an ideal day for scoring at Tiburon Golf Club. Of the 72 players in the field, 45 were under par following the opening round \u2014 and the top four women on the leaderboard combined for only one bogey. Lincicome was short with her approach on the par-4 18th, and dropped a shot to end her day.\n\n\"It's just fun to be playing well,\" Olson said. \"It's always a good feeling. I had a lot of like perfect numbers in today. Rolled the ball really well. Always fun to play well.\"\n\nLincicome started with five straight birdies to get her day rolling, and Hataoka enhanced her chances of winning the Race to the CME Globe and $1 million bonus with an eight-birdie outing. Lexi Thompson had five birdies and an eagle to card a 7-under 65, enhancing her bid for what would be her first and only win of 2018.\n\nLincicome said she played earlier this week with two young girls, and they reminded her how simple the game can be sometimes.\n\n\"There's no thinking,\" Lincicome said. \"It's just, 'hit it, find it, hit it again.'\"\n\nThis event will decide the year's LPGA scoring champion, as well as the winner of the Race to the CME Globe and the bonus that brings.\n\nThere are five women with the simplest path to that trophy \u2014 world No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn, Minjee Lee, Sung Hyun Park, Brooke Henderson and Hataoka would all win the Globe by winning the tournament. But on a day where many went low, four of those five players didn't really get into the birdie barrage.\n\nJutanugarn was 1 over after four holes, then rallied a bit to shoot a 2-under 70. Lee also finished at 2 under, Park was at 1 under, while Henderson was tied for last in the 72-player field at one point and wound up carding a 73 \u2014 aided by three birdies in her final five holes of the day.\n\nJutanugarn knew what she needed to do after finishing the opening round.\n\n\"Work on my tee shot,\" she said, \"and hope tomorrow is going to get better.\"\n\nThe mover in that group of five was Hataoka. If the order of finish Sunday were the same as it was when Thursday's play ended, Hataoka would walk off with the Globe.\n\nShe already has an idea how she wound spend the bonus.\n\n\"Seeing all the houses on the golf course really inspires me to want one of those,\" Hataoka said.\n\nThompson won the Globe last season \u2014 she's not in the group of 12 women with a mathematical chance of doing so this year \u2014 but has a pair of top-four finishes at the season finale in the last three years. She hasn't won yet in 2018, but felt a decent round was coming.\n\n\"It's only the first day,\" Thompson said. \"I'm just trying to take it one shot at a time, but it was nice to have a day like this. I knew my game was there.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Atlanta Falcons' defense has one primary goal entering Sunday's game against Dallas: Slow down Ezekiel Elliott and make Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott try to beat them with his arm.\n\nThe Falcons will need all their resources to corral Elliott, who leads the NFL with 93 runs of 10 or more yards over the last three years.\n\nAtlanta coach Dan Quinn says his defense, which gave up 211 yards rushing in last week's loss at Cleveland, must maintain gap control against a patient, powerful running back.\n\n\"He can wait to set up a block and stick his foot in the ground and really explode,\" Quinn said. \"Oftentimes, you can see him take a handoff and see a read about to happen, then he can change the direction and really explode. I would say the second piece of that is he's really effective as a pass catcher, too.\"\n\nAtlanta's struggling defense should get a boost from the return of middle linebacker Deion Jones, who hasn't played since breaking his right foot in the season opener. When healthy, Jones is the Falcons' best defender. He calls the plays, is stout against the run and is fast enough to cover running backs and receivers in coverage.\n\nJones' injury and season-ending surgeries for starting safeties Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen have been too much for the Falcons to overcome. They rank third-worst in average yards allowed and fourth-worst in scoring average.\n\nElliott is coming off a dazzling performance \u2014 19 runs and six catches for 187 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns \u2014 in a win at Philadelphia. But the Cowboys had to stay the course early when Elliott had just seven yards through the team's first two possessions.\n\n\"Honestly, at the beginning, it was a little bit tough sledding,\" Elliott said. \"We made some good adjustments. We have to have the same mentality going into this game.\"\n\nDallas' defense faces a tough challenge in matching up against Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan and star wideout Julio Jones, who has reached 10,000 yards receiving quicker than any player in NFL history.\n\nSo, there isn't much wiggle room for either team. Both are 4-5 and trying to stay in the playoff hunt.\n\nHere are things to know about the Cowboys-Falcons matchup:\n\nTHIN D-LINE\n\nThe Cowboys started practice this week with five defensive linemen sidelined by injuries: David Irving (ankle), Taco Charlton (shoulder), Maliek Collins (knee), Daniel Ross (calf) and Antwaun Woods (concussion).\n\nCollins and Woods both played more than 60 percent of the snaps against Philadelphia. If either can't play against the Falcons, the depth on the interior line will be tested.\n\nDallas might not be able to use Tyrone Crawford outside as much to ease the load on DeMarcus Lawrence and Randy Gregory. Lawrence, who has battled shoulder issues this season and has a history of back trouble, played a season-high 90 percent of the snaps against the Eagles.\n\nFIGHTING FOR RESPECT\n\nFalcons cornerback Desmond Trufant is enduring his toughest year as a pro with five dropped interceptions, the worst coming on Cincinnati's game-winning drive in Week 4.\n\nTrufant, a first-round pick in 2013, takes the blame for not playing consistently sound fundamentals.\n\n\"I'm judging myself harder than anybody else can,\" he said. \"So it is what it is. It's the league. I'm in the spotlight. I'm earning what I'm earning. It just comes with it. That's just how it goes. I'm in that position. I'll just keep working, attack the issues, stay humble. I've been here before. I'll just keep working.\"\n\nCOMPARING PICKS\n\nThe Cowboys were high on Calvin Ridley going into the draft, having spent plenty of time with the former Alabama receiver and needing a replacement after releasing Dez Bryant, the franchise's career leader in touchdown catches, in a cost-cutting move in the offseason. Instead, Dallas went with Boise State linebacker Leighton Vander Esch at No. 19. The Falcons chose Ridley seven picks later.\n\nBoth teams are pleased.\n\nVander Esch set a rookie franchise record with 19 tackles against the Eagles, according to the coaches' count. Ridley leads all rookies with 500 yards receiving and has been a strong complement to Julio Jones.\n\nLOOKING BETTER\n\nPrescott was steady in leading 75-yard drives for touchdowns in the fourth quarter last week, each of which answered a TD from the Eagles. It has been an inconsistent season for the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie the Year as he ranks 33rd in average yards passing, but Dallas coach Jason Garrett says the team ignores outside criticism.\n\n\"Well, we don't spend much on that,\" Garrett said. \"We spend most of our time on ourselves and what we need to do to be better. That's every one of us. Every coach. Every player. And we love Dak. Dak has done some really great things for our team in the 2 \u00bd years that he's been our starting quarterback. He's continuing to grow as a player.\"\n\nSTAY STRONG\n\nRyan needs the threat of play-action, but that's hard to maintain when the Falcons' running game starts strong and fades. It's been a frustrating trend all season.\n\n\"We just need to stick with it,\" he said. \"Last week, we just played from behind most of the third and fourth quarter, which makes it difficult to run the football. I thought that we had our opportunities. We did some nice things in the run game last week, so staying in front of the chains and staying ahead and the score is key to keeping our run game rolling.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Schuyler Dixon in Dallas contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

For the fitness enthusiast: The Peloton Bike\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Peloton Bike (Photo: Peloton)\n\nA few months ago, I got the Peloton bike to test (review coming soon), and it was life changing. So much so, that we bought it, leaving it to sit proudly in our living room taking up 75% of our small apartment. Okay, it doesn\u2019t take up THAT much room, but we don\u2019t care. We love it that much. My husband uses it every day. Me, not so much, but I aspire to get there one day. It\u2019s a cycling bike with a tablet screen that displays live and on-demand classes. As a former Soul Cycle addict, I can tell you that after taking Peloton classes, I no longer consider Soul Cycle a legit workout. It\u2019s just fun.

I\u2019m not exaggerating. There is something about faux fur blankets that takes my mind to a Sunday morning on the couch (in a very clean home) with no responsibilities and hot chocolate. I don\u2019t even like hot chocolate, yet it always in these daydreams. Why? Because luxury is relative, and I find these things luxurious. I would assume most people do, too. This blanket from Anthropologie has a bunch of 5-star reviews, and will bring much luxury into your living room. It\u2019s also pretty big: 70\u201d x 60\u201d.\n\nGet the Fireside Faux Fur Throw Blanket at Anthropologie for $98\n\n12. For the one into movie night: Nebula Portable Projector\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Nebula Projector (Photo: Amazon)\n\nHaving a movie theater in your home sounds pretty luxurious, but you probably aren\u2019t giving someone a home remodel or expansion for the holidays.

I\u2019m just kidding. They don\u2019t say that. But in my experience, it\u2019s true. And isn\u2019t luxury having everything you need at your fingertips (knife humor)?

Nebraska's Adrian Martinez and Purdue's Rondale Moore lead the list of the conference's top rookies. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 With 58 freshmen, Minnesota leads the FBS with 51.7 percent of players on the roster in their first year of eligibility.\n\nNine of them are starters, including seven on offense, to make this season for the Gophers all about growth. While losing five of their first six Big Ten games, outscored by an average of 43-26 during those contests, the Gophers felt their share of pain.\n\nWith true freshman quarterback Zack Annexstad injured and struggling, coach P.J. Fleck made a slight upgrade in experience last month by replacing him with redshirt freshman Tanner Morgan. The Gophers started the final quarter of their season in stride with a 41-10 victory over Purdue that served as a potential sign this teenager-driven offense has matured. Wide receiver Rashod Bateman, running back Mohamed Ibrahim and right tackle Daniel Faalele are all true freshmen who have stood out.\n\n\"You're almost like, 'I'm not sure what's going to come out of that tunnel at times just because everything is so new,\" Fleck said recently. \"Everything is for the first time with a lot of these young men.\"\n\nSuch widespread youth movements typically don't produce immediate success, of course, and one of the teams Minnesota is tied for last place with in the Big Ten West Division is Illinois. Not coincidentally, the Illini have the fewest seniors in the FBS with only eight on the roster and have played 18 true freshmen.\n\nNebraska is also at the bottom of that division, though there's no question which freshman in the conference this year came the most game-ready: Huskers quarterback Adrian Martinez.\n\nDespite sitting out his senior season of high school with an injury, Martinez already has six games with at least 300 yards of total offense to tie the school record.\n\n\"Every week he gets a little more comfortable with the offense. Every week he's making a few more better decisions,\" coach Scott Frost said, adding: \"There's not going to be anybody better than him once he gets as good as he can be.\"\n\nMartinez is the first Huskers true freshman at any position with 500-plus rushing yards in a season since David Horne in 2002, and his 2,212 passing yards through 10 games is already eighth on Nebraska's single-season list. Martinez is fourth in the Big Ten in passing efficiency.\n\n\"I still feel like I haven't scratched the surface,\" Martinez said.\n\nRight behind Martinez on the major-impact scale for Big Ten rookies is Purdue wide receiver Rondale Moore.\n\nHe leads the FBS with an average of 8.2 receptions per game and is third with an average of 172 all-purpose yards per game. Moore and Martinez have each won or shared the Big Ten Freshman of the Week award three times.\n\nHere's a look at some of the other freshmen around the conference who are making a strong impression:\n\n\u2014 ISAIAH BOWSER, Northwestern running back:\n\nElevated to a more prominent role after Jeremy Larkin had to halt his career because of a spinal condition, Bowser totaled 483 rushing yards and four touchdowns over the last four games to help the Wildcats clinch the Big Ten West Division title. He's the first true Northwestern freshman with back-to-back 100-yard games on the ground since Justin Jackson in 2014.\n\n\u2014 JAKE FERGUSON, Wisconsin tight end:\n\nThe grandson of former Badgers coach and current athletic director Barry Alvarez who grew up in Madison just a few miles from campus, Ferguson has been connected to the program from birth. After redshirting in 2017, he leads the team with 27 receptions and is second with 379 yards. He's been targeted 20 times on third or fourth down, with 15 catches for 212 yards and 11 conversions.\n\n\u2014 K.J. HAMLER, Penn State wide receiver:\n\nSelected as a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award that goes to the most versatile player in the FBS, Hamler is second in the Big Ten with 569 total return yards and sixth with an average of 16.73 yards per catch. He had a 93-yard touchdown reception against Ohio State, the second-longest play from scrimmage in program history.\n\n\u2014 ANTHONY MCFARLAND, Maryland running back:\n\nMcFarland ran for a Terrapins freshman record 210 yards against Indiana last week after senior Ty Johnson left with an injury, and also set the Maryland single-season freshman record with 724 rushing yards after taking a redshirt in 2017.\n\n\u2014 STEVIE SCOTT, Indiana running back:\n\nEach of the last four featured ball-carriers for the Hoosiers have reached the NFL, including standouts Tevin Coleman and Jordan Howard, and Scott has taken a big first step in replacing the injured Cole Gest. Scott is second among FBS true freshmen with 159 attempts and 791 rushing yards. The powerful 6-foot-2, 236-pound Scott has been adept and pushing the pile forward, with a cumulative loss of only 13 yards.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Richard, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Baker Mayfield is making a handoff from the heart.\n\nThe Browns rookie quarterback has teamed up with Barstool Sports to raise money for Special Olympics, an organization he first made a personal connection with while playing at Oklahoma. Mayfield has helped create a line of clothing merchandise , including T-shirts, hoodies and a flag bearing his image, with 100 percent of the sales proceeds going to Special Olympics Ohio.\n\nMayfield was moved to do more charitable work after being involved in college with \"Special Spectators,\" a program that allows seriously ill children to have an all-access, VIP-day at sporting events.\n\n\"It was a special bond, and when you do stuff like that, it makes a huge difference when you can build an actual relationship instead of just saying, 'Hey, I like this cause I want to throw money at it',\" Mayfield said in a phone interview with The Associated Press.\n\n\"But there were relationships throughout that process that made a huge impact on me so my love for inspiring kids and competing in sports made Special Olympics a very easy choice to help out.\"\n\nMayfield said being around children and young adults with disabilities and other challenges gives him perspective \u2014 and appreciation.\n\n\"I'm so blessed to be in the position that I'm in,\" he said. \"It makes me think that there are no bad days. I need to be thankful for what I have and when I'm around kids like that, they always find a way to put a smile on my face when they have absolutely every reason not to do that. And to me, that's inspiring. That's finding the good in every situation, the positives in every situation that you can and it's so much fun to see.\"\n\nMayfield launched the initiative during his bye week with the Browns, who selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL draft. Mayfield had his best game as a pro last week, throwing three touchdown passes as Cleveland beat Atlanta 28-16 to snap a four-game losing streak.\n\nIt's been a bumpy first NFL season for both Mayfield and the Browns, who are undergoing more change following coach Hue Jackson's recent firing.\n\nBut Mayfield has long-suffering Cleveland fans feeling good about the team's future, especially because it appears the Browns finally have found a franchise quarterback.\n\nFor Mayfield, the adversity is nothing new. He battled to win a starting job in high school and then walked on at both Texas Tech and Oklahoma before winning the Heisman Trophy.\n\nObstacles are nothing new, and in some ways, he feels coming to Cleveland and helping the Browns was destined.\n\n\"I think everything happens for a reason,\" he said. \"I love a good challenge. I think it's been everything that I've gone through, the lessons I've learned and the things that I'll continue to learn now that I'm here. Yeah, I think it's absolutely meant to be, and I couldn't be happier to have an opportunity to change it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Charles Krupa, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Columbia Gas of Massachusetts did not use a professional engineer to draw up plans to replace old cast-iron gas mains in the Merrimack Valley in September \u2014 a factor, federal authorities say, that could have contributed to the explosions that killed one person and injured at least 21 others.\n\nThat's one conclusion from an urgent safety report issued by the National Transportation Safety Board Thursday.\n\nMassachusetts, like many states, exempts utility companies from state licensing laws for engineers. The NTSB now recommends that Massachusetts end the practice.\n\nThe board made a similar recommendation to Nisource Inc., the parent company of Columbia Gas. The recommendations are non-binding, but are likely to have industry-wide implications because of the scope of the Merrimack Valley incident, which is expected to cost more than $800 million in damages.\n\nMore: Pipeline peril: Natural gas explosions reveal silent danger lurking in old cast-iron pipes\n\nMassachusetts' two U.S. senators, Democrats Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, called on Columbia Gas to implement the recommendations immediately.\n\n\u201cColumbia Gas failed to keep track of what projects were being done on their gas system. It failed to prioritize safety when conducting those projects. And it failed its customers, the residents of the Merrimack Valley, and the public trust,\u201d Markey and Warren said in a joint statement.\n\nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over natural gas pipelines, will hold a field hearing in Massachusetts Nov. 26 to investigate the incident. The company has also disclosed that it has been subpoenaed in a criminal investigation.\n\nMore: Federal prosecutors open criminal investigation into Massachusetts natural gas explosions\n\nThe recommendations cover the utility's drafting of repair work, its record keeping of its pipeline inventory, and its process to manage changes in processes to take safety into account.\n\nThe board said Columbia Gas should have had field personnel ready to monitor pressures and shut off gas in the event of an over-pressure situation.\n\nWork crews were upgrading a cast-iron gas main with plastic pipe on Sept. 13 when a surge in gas pressure caused fires and explosions across the towns of Lawrence, Andover and North Andover.\n\nThe NTSB says the utility's work plans failed to mention a pressure-sensing feedback line. When the old main was taken out of service, a regulator station sensed the loss of pressure and pumped more gas into the line.\n\nPressures spiked to 12 times normal, and houses began exploding.\n\nA Columbia Gas control room in Columbus, Ohio noticed the pressure spike within minutes. But after an unexplained change in process four years ago, the utility no longer puts technicians in place to monitor pressures on the ground \u2014 and to respond to an over-pressure event by manually shutting off the gas, the NTSB said.\n\nThe utility said Thursday it was reviewing the board's recommendations but is already implementing some safety measures.\n\nOne such move: A $150 million plan to install \"slam-shut\" over-pressurization protection devices on low-pressure pipelines to automatically shut down gas when high pressures are detected.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/15/ntsb-recommendations-columbia-gas-massachusetts-explosions-pipelines-nisource/2015618002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Iowa looks to exploit porous Illini defense, end skid", "description": "Iowa looks to exploit porous Illini defense in crucial Big Ten game on Saturday, end 3-game skid", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/15/iowa-looks-to-exploit-porous-illini-defense-end-skid/38537925/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:24:58Z", "content": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill.

(AP) \u2014 The Illinois offense can run, but its porous defense can't hide. And Iowa knows it.\n\nThe Hawkeyes hope to slow the Illini running game and take advantage of one of the nation's worst defenses to end a three-game skid when Iowa (6-4, 3-4 Big Ten) travels to Champaign on Saturday.\n\nThe Hawkeyes, which started the season 6-1 before the losing streak, will put its stumbling offense up against an Illini defense that's given up an average of 532 yards per game this season.\n\n\"As you can well imagine, our first goal as a team is to win,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \"And our secondary goals are to score points offensively and stop points on the defensive side. We spend a lot of time evaluating our team, looking at our team, watching them and then week-to-week trying to figure out what gives us the best chance to do those two things.\"\n\nIowa is coming off a 14-10 home loss to Northwestern. Hawkeyes quarterback Nate Stanley threw for 269 yards, but the team only generated 64 yards rushing, including only 3 of 13 on third downs, with an average gain of eight yards.\n\nIllinois coach Lovie Smith said his team has been working hard in practice to address its issues.\n\n\"All those things we talked about with tackling, dropped passes, all those things we need to get fixed,\" Smith said this week. \"It's now or never. We know what we're capable of doing.\"\n\nWHAT A RUSH\n\nIllinois (4-6, 2-5) makes up in rushing offense what it lacks in defense.\n\nYet even that bright spot is causing some concern. Star tailback Reggie Corbin left last week's 54-35 loss to Nebraska with a foot injury. He's expected to suit up and play Saturday against Iowa, although he may see limited carries. Corbin is crucial to the Illini offensive attack. He has rushed for 1,011 yards this season, averaging 8.9 yards per carry, and has nine touchdowns.\n\nRunning back Mike Epstein injured a foot earlier in the season and Smith said he doesn't expect him back this year. Ra'Von Bonner and Dre Brown will rotate with Corbin in the backfield, he said.\n\nAT QUARTERBACK\n\nIowa quarterback Stanley has been dealing with an injured thumb sustained three weeks ago in a loss to Penn State. Ferentz said he is \"doing better.\"\n\n\"I don't know if Nate's 100 percent,\" Ferentz said this week. \"But he's certainly doing better and doing fine.\"\n\nThere was some concern the three-game losing streak might be affecting Stanley, which he brushed off during Tuesday's press conference.\n\n\"I'm just making sure that I stay positive and help my teammates out as much as I can,\" Stanley said. \"There's always room to do more.\"\n\nIllinois quarterback AJ Bush is a marquee rusher, but his lackluster passing game has garnered some criticism. In Saturday's loss to Nebraska, Bush was 18-of-25 passing for 216 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. He rushed 14 times for 127 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBOWL HOPES\n\nMany believe Iowa will receive a bowl bid of some sort, especially if they can beat Illinois. Six wins is generally the lowest threshold for postseason bowl invitations. Hawkeye fans will look for more playing time for tight end Noah Fant, who had a diminished role in the loss to Northwestern.\n\nThe road is much tougher for the Illini, which needs to win against Iowa and Northwestern for any chance.\n\nALL IOWA LATELY\n\nIowa has dominated the series with Illinois the past decade. The Hawkeyes have won nine of the past 10 games by an average of nearly 17 points.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Joey Bosa isn't sure if he will make his long-awaited season debut for the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe third-year lineman has practiced the last two days as he works his way back from a foot injury that caused him to miss the first 10 games. Bosa said before Thursday's practice that he is doing team and individual drills and that he feels good. But he also acknowledged that it will likely be a game-time decision if he plays this week.\n\n\"I'm just continuing on with the process today,\" Bosa said. \"We're sticking to the plan right now, and that's to practice and take it one day at a time and see how it feels then.\"\n\nSticking to the plan and being patient is something that Bosa has had a hard time doing. Bosa first injured his left foot during training camp, which caused him to miss the preseason. He reinjured it during practice on Sept. 5. The Chargers said he has a bone bruise.\n\nBosa has said throughout the rehab process that he should have taken things slower and not tried to rush back for the opener. He also hoped to be back by early November, following the team's bye week, before ramping down expectations.\n\n\"I kept putting timetables on it and it really never played out,\" Bosa said. \"Once we kind of got the message across that it's going to be ready when it's ready, we kind of all got on the same page, coaches and everything. Ever since then it's kind of been a week-to-week kind of thing. And it's been easier on me not having a set deadline.\"\n\nDefensive coordinator Gus Bradley said Bosa has looked good in the limited snaps he took, but that he is waiting to see what comes next.\n\n\"I think for him it's just exciting to see him back on the field and with his teammates and going through that next step of his rehab,\" Bradley said.\n\nBosa said his foot responded well after a couple full days of practice. He said he still feels some pain, but that is something he expects will last through the remainder of the season.\n\nThe Chargers are 7-2 and have won six straight despite Bosa's absence. The defense is ranked 14th in total yards allowed (356.6 yards per game) but is eighth in scoring, allowing 20.7 points per game.\n\nThe pass rush struggled early without Bosa, who had 23 sacks in two seasons, but they have rebounded with 15 sacks over the past four games.\n\n\"I'm really proud of the D-line, especially the young guys stepping into my position, and really holding it down and doing a great job,\" Bosa said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Giants face the Buccaneers on Sunday. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 They were long-time teammates and champions on the New York Giants' Super Bowl team in February 2012.\n\nEli Manning and Jason Pierre-Paul will add a new dimension to their eight-year friendship Sunday when the Giants (2-7) host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-6) at MetLife Stadium.\n\nThey'll be opponents for the first time.\n\nAs he has been the past 15 seasons, Manning will be quarterback for the Giants. Pierre-Paul will be playing defensive end for Tampa Bay in his first game at the Meadowlands since New York traded him to the Bucs in March to clear salary-cap space.\n\nPierre-Paul has had this date checked since the schedule was announced.\n\n\"Eli is Eli, man. I know one thing: If he's hot, he's going to continue being hot,\" Pierre-Paul said of Manning, who took some heat off himself by throwing three touchdown passes and engineering a late TD drive in the Giants' win over San Francisco last Monday night. \"We've got to get after him early and he knows I'm coming. I'm coming Eli, I'm coming. Just letting you know.\"\n\nPierre-Paul didn't get the best sendoff after the trade. Not many teammates called him, although Manning did.\n\n\"He's a leader. I actually learned this from him, he comes in every morning real early,\" said Pierre-Paul, who has eight sacks this season, two less than the entire Giants team. \"He started that as a rookie. He never changed. Eli's a great guy. But I ain't falling asleep on him. That's for sure.\"\n\nManning laughed saying, he hopes JPP takes it easy on him.\n\n\"He's getting a lot of sacks and making plays,\" Manning said. \"I expect him to be fired up. Hopefully we've got a game plan for him, and make sure we try to control him.\"\n\nHere are five things to watch Sunday:\n\nCONTROLLING PIERRE-PAUL\n\nThe Giants' offensive line, which added waiver-wire pickup Jamon Brown at right guard, had one of its better performances Monday. Manning, who has been sacked 32 times, was taken down once. Left tackle Nate Solder will probably go against Pierre-Paul most of the time.\n\nSince Pierre-Paul lines up at different spots, right tackle Chad Wheeler also will go against him. Expect a tight end or a running back to chip him.\n\nEXPLOSIVE OFFENSE\n\nTampa Bay has the NFL's top-ranked passing attack and is also No. 1 in total offense. With 3,251 yards passing, the Bucs have thrown for the second-most yards through the first nine games of a season in NFL history behind the 2000 St. Louis Rams (3,330).\n\nThey've had over 500 yards total offense four times this season, but are 1-3 in those games, including last week's loss to Washington. Turnovers are the biggest reason. They are a league-worst minus-19 and have gone six consecutive games without a takeaway.\n\nCLASSMATES\n\nTampa Bay's Mike Evans and New York's Odell Beckham Jr. were part of an outstanding class of rookie receivers who entered the NFL in 2014. The group included Brandin Cooks, Jarvis Landry, Devante Adams, Sammy Watkins, Allen Robinson, Jordan Matthews, John Brown and Kelvin Benjamin. Evans (5,416) and Beckham (5,282) rank 1-2 among the class in career yards receiving, while Beckham is first with 42 TD catches, followed by Evans with 36. Beckham has 24 100-yard receiving games, tops in the class. Evans is next at 17.\n\nLACK OF PRESSURE\n\nThe Giants have 10 sacks. Rookies Lorenzo Carter and B.J. Hill lead with two apiece. The Bucs had allowed 26 sacks, but they also throw the ball an average of 41 times.\n\n\"We've got to find a way to get some more pressure,\" Giants defensive coordinator James Bettcher said. \"We've got to win some more 1-on-1s, we've got to beat the back when we get on the back in protection. If we get a free runner, we've got to time up our pressures a little bit better. We had a couple of those this past week when our timing just wasn't good enough. We were a little late in the pressures and we've got to clean that up, and play better on third down.\"\n\nA RETURNMAN\n\nThe Giants seemingly have found someone to return kickoffs. Corey Coleman handled the job for the first time in his NFL career, averaging almost 31 yards on three returns.\n\nSpecial teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey was confident the 15th overall pick in the 2016 draft (Cleveland) could handle the job after being signed to the practice squad on Oct. 18. He had been waived by the Patriots.\n\n\"He did it in college,\" McGaughey said. \"That's part of our job as coaches, we've got to do our research. I worked with Art Briles, so I always followed Baylor kind of closely so I knew about him and I knew about his past. Kid can run.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Fred Goodall in Tampa, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Instead, Players may wear shoes displaying any of the following colors, in any proportion: (i) black, white, and gray; (ii) any colors displayed on the Player\u2019s uniform (and certain variations thereof); and (iii) any additional colors designated by the Player\u2019s Club.\"\n\nShoe designs will have to be pre-approved by teams.\n\n\u201cWe view footwear as an important part to the marketing of the game,\u2019\u2019 Commissioner Rob Manfred said. \u201cWe also believe it\u2019s a vehicle that allows players to express their individuality. The amendment will provide players with additional flexibility on shoe colors and design, while preserving the clubs\u2019 uniform color schemes.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd one weekend a year, players can wear whatever they want, including flip-flops, if that\u2019s their desire.\n\nWhen Zobrist complained to MLB this season about the footwear restrictions, he explained his black cleats were a tribute to players he idolized - including Ernie Banks and Stan Musial. He also struck a chord in an area MLB is trying to harness - young fans' interest in the game.\n\nZobrist wrote: \"Maybe there is some kid out there that will be inspired to look more into the history of the game by the \u201cflexibility\u201d that I prefer in the color of my shoes.\"\n\nManfred mentioned that in his comments Thursday.\n\n\u201cOne weekend, players will be allowed to wear whatever they want on their feet,\u2019\u2019 Manfred said, \u201ca source of great interest to younger fans. \u2026\n\n\u201cWe believe that this agreement strikes the appropriate balance between the shared goal of permitting players to express their individuality while maintaining reasonable restrictions on shoe colors and designs.\u201d\n\nSaid MLBPA executive director Tony Clark: \u201cPlayers welcome the expanded opportunity to express themselves and engage with fans through innovative design. We look forward to seeing their creativity and individuality on the field in 2019.\u201d\n\nGentlemen, start those shoe designs now.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @BNightengale"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Reviewed.com, Samantha Matt, Reviewed.com", "title": "25 splurge-worthy gifts everyone is obsessing over this year", "description": "These are the best luxury gifts of 2018, approved by Reviewed's product experts.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/15/best-luxury-gifts-2018-20-expensive-gifts-everyone-love/2012176002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/15/USAT/b8f48341-ccff-44fb-bd2e-c98b2c4922a5-best-luxury-gifts-hero2.png?crop=1599,899,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:10:51Z", "content": "The best luxury gifts of 2018 (Photo: Peloton and Nordstrom) Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\n\u2018Tis the season of giving means \u2018tis the season of buying. This means investing in things for other people. However, the fear of giving a parent an expensive tablet that will collect dust in a desk drawer, or giving a granddaughter a pricey necklace she\u2019ll never wear is real. But this fear doesn\u2019t have to lead to gift cards or less expensive items. You can still invest in the people you love over the holidays and make the right choice at the same time.\n\nLuckily, my Reviewed colleagues and I are here to help. All year long, we review and research products\u2014a lot of them on the pricey side. Using our knowledge, consumer reviews, and my expertise in all things expensive (don't tell my credit card I said this), we've devised a guide of gift ideas that are worthy of their high cost. Here are 20 of the best and most popular luxurious (and expensive) products we think would make great gifts in 2018.\n\n1. For the one who is always 'getting ready': Harry Josh Pro Tools x Serge Normant The Volume Kit\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Harry Josh Pro Tools Set (Photo: Dermstore)\n\nThe best hair dryer we\u2019ve ever tested is the Harry Josh Pro Tools Pro Dryer 2000. This amazing hair dryer retails for $249 alone, but this kit from Dermstore includes 3 luxurious hair products by Serge Normant, as well as a Harry Josh bag, for $189. That\u2019s insane. You pay less for the hair dryer\u2014and get more at the same time. This is an insanely good deal and an insanely luxurious gift.\n\nGet the Harry Josh Pro Tools x Serge Normant The Volume Kit from Dermstore for $189 ($296 value)\n\n2. For the music lover: Sonos One Smart Speaker\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Sonos One Smart Speaker (Photo: Sonos)\n\nGive the gift of luxury sound this year with the Sonos One Smart Speaker. This all-new voice controlled smart speaker by Sonos is one of our favorite gift ideas for 2018. With Alexa built it, you can not only play music, but also check news and traffic and control other smart devices. If you\u2019re looking for something a little less expensive specifically for playing music, consider Sonos Play:1 speakers.\n\nGet the Sonos One Smart Speaker on Amazon for $199\n\n3. For the one who\u2019s always traveling: Away \u2018Set of Two\u2019 Luggage\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Away Luggage 'Set of Two' (Photo: Away)\n\nYou've probably seen this trendy luggage on Instagram, since it's a travel blogger favorite. The brand is also one of our favorites here at Reviewed. When we tested checked luggage, Away won as our best hard-sided suitcase. This set includes a carry-on with your choice of medium or large checked luggage. There\u2019s also an option for a set of three if you want them all! They come in 14 different colors, and you can get with or without the battery. If you go with the battery, you can pop it out to check your suitcase and pop it back in to charge your phone later.\n\nGet the Away \u2018Set of Two\u2019 Luggage on Away for $450 - $520\n\n4. For the home chef: Staub Cast Iron\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Staub Round Cocotte (Photo: Staub)\n\nStaub cookware is having a moment. When registering for wedding gifts this year, an employee at Williams-Sonoma told me to go with a Staub dutch oven over a Le Creuset. Then, we tested them at Reviewed, and guess who won best overall? Staub. The dutch oven even made an appearance at Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s wedding (see here\u2014they come in at slide 4). Trendy and luxurious, this is your best bet for a gift for home chefs this year.\n\nGet the Staub Cast Iron 5.5 Quart Round Cocotte on Amazon for $324.95\n\n5. For the one who enjoys when people do things for them: The best robot vacuum of 2018\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Roomba i7+ Robot Vacuum (Photo: iRobot)\n\nKeeping a clean home is a luxurious thing when you\u2019re not the one cleaning it. That\u2019s why robot vacuums were created. If you have a good one, it will do the work for you, and if you have room to splurge, it will work that much better. When we tested the iRobot Roomba i7+, our robot vacuum expert gave it a nearly perfect score. The robot vacuum can empty its dirt bin all by itself and then continue vacuuming. This thing is truly the most luxurious robot vacuum we've seen, and we're sure you'll like it, too.\n\nGet the iRobot Roomba i7+ at Walmart for $949\n\n6. For the one who likes to keep warm: Canada Goose Coat\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Canada Goose Jacket (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nIf the person you\u2019re shopping for lives in a place that gets chilly for part of the year, give them the gift that people have been going nuts over the past couple of winters: a Canada Goose jacket. These expensive jackets promote ultra-warmth with goose feathers, and people love them. They have tons of styles, each one with dozens of 4.5 to 5 star reviews. You can\u2019t go wrong getting someone one of these coats. Tom Brady shops at Canada Goose. Enough said.\n\nGet the Women\u2019s Kensington Slim Fit Down Parka with Genuine Coyote Fur Trim at Nordstrom for $925\n\nGet the Women\u2019s Shelburne Genuine Coyote Fur Trim Down Parka at Nordstrom for $950\n\nGet the Men\u2019s Langford Slim Fit Down Parka with Genuine Coyote Fur Trim at Nordstrom for $950\n\n7. For the working commuter: Sony 1000XM3 Noise Canceling Headphones\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Sony WH1000XM3 Headphones (Photo: Sony)\n\nLast year, we recommended Bose\u2019s Quiet Comfort headphones, but this year, we love Sony\u2019s Noise Canceling Headphones much more. They are the best noise canceling headphones on the market right now. If you know someone who gets easily annoyed by loud co-workers or lives for peaceful subway rides, this gift could be the answer to all of their first world problems.\n\nGet the Sony 1000XM3 Noise Canceling Headphones at Amazon for $348\n\n8. For the one who has everything: La Mer\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: La Mer Kit (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nLa Mer moisturizer is like the KitchenAid Stand Mixer of beauty products, except you don\u2019t see it on wedding registries even though one would definitely get way more use out of it than a stand mixer. Have I ever used La Mer? No, I prefer to spend money I don\u2019t have on clothes, but people love this stuff. Cr\u00e8me de la Mar, the famous moisturizing cream, has 50,000 hearts on Sephora and a 5-star rating on Nordstrom from over 2,800 people. If you\u2019re splurging on a woman who is all about that clear skin life, La Mer is the way to go (I\u2019m talking to you, people who are going to splurge on me, which is no one, ugh, bye).\n\nGet the La Mer \u2018The Spa collection\u2019 from Nordstrom for $340 ($451 value)\n\n9. For the TV lover: One of 2018\u2019s best TVs\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: TCL 6 Series (Photo: Reviewed / Lee Neikirk)\n\nWhether you\u2019re shopping for a Netflix nerd, a sports-watching fanatic, or someone who doesn\u2019t watch too much TV, chances are they would appreciate a new TV. We recommend gifting one of the best TVs of 2018, the TCL 55-inch 6 series. Our TV expert tested the 6 series this year, giving it a rave review .That\u2019s how you know it\u2019s good.\n\nGet the TCL 55-inch 6 Series from Amazon for $629.99\n\n10. For the fitness enthusiast: The Peloton Bike\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Peloton Bike (Photo: Peloton)\n\nA few months ago, I got the Peloton bike to test (review coming soon), and it was life changing. So much so, that we bought it, leaving it to sit proudly in our living room taking up 75% of our small apartment. Okay, it doesn\u2019t take up THAT much room, but we don\u2019t care. We love it that much. My husband uses it every day. Me, not so much, but I aspire to get there one day. It\u2019s a cycling bike with a tablet screen that displays live and on-demand classes. As a former Soul Cycle addict, I can tell you that after taking Peloton classes, I no longer consider Soul Cycle a legit workout. It\u2019s just fun. If you know a fitness studio enthusiast, this is a PERFECT gift. You feel like you\u2019re in a studio surrounded by others, but you\u2019re AT HOME. Working out does not get more luxurious than this.\n\nGet a Peloton Cycling Package from Peloton for $2,245 - $2,694 (or as low as $58/mo - $70/mo for 39 mos at 0% APR)\n\n11. For the homebody: Faux fur blanket\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Faux Fur Blanket (Photo: Anthropologie)\n\nOther than flying first class to Fiji, a faux fur blanket is just about as luxurious as it gets. I\u2019m not exaggerating. There is something about faux fur blankets that takes my mind to a Sunday morning on the couch (in a very clean home) with no responsibilities and hot chocolate. I don\u2019t even like hot chocolate, yet it always in these daydreams. Why? Because luxury is relative, and I find these things luxurious. I would assume most people do, too. This blanket from Anthropologie has a bunch of 5-star reviews, and will bring much luxury into your living room. It\u2019s also pretty big: 70\u201d x 60\u201d.\n\nGet the Fireside Faux Fur Throw Blanket at Anthropologie for $98\n\n12. For the one into movie night: Nebula Portable Projector\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Nebula Projector (Photo: Amazon)\n\nHaving a movie theater in your home sounds pretty luxurious, but you probably aren\u2019t giving someone a home remodel or expansion for the holidays. Well, what about a projector? With the Nebula, which is loved by one of our editors, you can binge watch Netflix in 720p on your own DIY big screen. It\u2019s just like having your own theater.\n\nGet the Nebula by Anker Portable Projector with 720p on Amazon for $499.99\n\n13. For the one who loves to bake: Kitchen Aid\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018 KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nGive someone the gift of a luxurious kitchen countertop this year with our favorite stand mixer, the KitchenAid Artisan. They will not only love the way our favorite stand mixer looks, but they\u2019ll love the treats they bake with it. Even if they\u2019ve had a Kitchen Aid for years, a new one would be a welcomed upgrade.\n\nGet the KitchenAid Artisan Tilt-Head Stand Mixer in Empire Red on Amazon for $278.63\n\n14. For the one who will never have enough bags: A luxurious bag\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Designer Bags (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nI aspire to one day live a luxurious life in which I can parade around with a Chlo\u00e9 handbag. Until then, I will encourage other people already living luxurious lives to do so for me. This particular Chlo\u00e9 bag is stylish, chic, and calling my name through its calfskin leather material. With 4.5 stars from approximately 150 happy people, you\u2019ve got a winner here. The other bag I\u2019m recommending is Gucci\u2019s Soho Disco Leather Bag. With a 5-star rating from 170 people, you know you\u2019ve got a trendy, well-made, stylish bag on your hands\u2014or, uh, shoulder, if we\u2019re being literal here.\n\nGet the Chlo\u00e9 \u2018Medium Marcie\u2019 Leather Satchel from Nordstrom for $1,990\n\nGet the Gucci Soho Disco Leather Bag from Nordstrom for $1,190\n\n15. For the one with all the latest and greatest tech: Nanoleaf Rhythm Edition\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Nanoleaf (Photo: Amazon)\n\nCoined by one of our editors are AMAZING (in all caps), these lights are THE gift for anyone you know who is into tech gadgets. Whether they\u2019re a college student looking for an awesome way to dress up their dorm or a smart home enthusiast who could never own enough gadgets, this rhythm smarter kit is perfect. The panels light up and change colors to the beat of your favorite songs.\n\nGet the Nanoleaf Rhythm Edition Smarter Kit on Amazon for $239.99\n\n16. For the one still building their dream kitchen: Zwilling J.A. Henckels 18-Piece Knife Block Set\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Zwilling Knife Set (Photo: Sur la Table)\n\nIt\u2019s true what they say: You don\u2019t know you\u2019re in need of a good knife until you\u2019re in need of a good knife. I\u2019m just kidding. They don\u2019t say that. But in my experience, it\u2019s true. And isn\u2019t luxury having everything you need at your fingertips (knife humor)? We tested knife sets this year, and this 18-piece set by Zwilling J.A. Henckels was our favorite. It includes pretty much every knife you will ever need for a great price.\n\nGet the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Gourmet Classic 18-Piece Knife Block Set on Amazon for $279.95\n\n17. For the one stuck in the \u201890s: Impossible Project Polaroid Camera\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Impossible Project Polaroid (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nFirst of all, I love this. It is honestly the most \u201890s looking thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Like, if you look up \u201890s in the dictionary, do you see this? I think you do. Over the past couple of years, instant film cameras have become popular again. While we love Fujifilm\u2019s adorable and affordable mini Instax camera, this Polaroid kicks the luxury level up a few notches for the look alone.\n\nGet the Impossible Project Polaroid 600 96 Cam Instant Camera at Nordstrom for $189.99\n\n18. For the shoe enthusiast: High-end shoes\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: High-end Shoes (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nKnow someone into shoes and also luxury? Well, you\u2019re in luck for gift ideas. Let\u2019s talk women\u2019s shoes first. Louboutins specifically. These are the shoes with the red bottom that Cardi B sings about. You could go with the classic \u2018So Kate\u2019 Pointy Toe Pumps that have 142 4-star reviews in a solid color (go with black), OR you could go all out with the Rainbow Pigalle Follies Pump. I saw these while browsing Nordstrom.com earlier this year and my body went into a state of shock. They are beautiful.\n\nNow men\u2019s sneakers. These PLAY x Converse Chuck Taylors have 394 5-star reviews for a reason. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not just because they look good. They probably feel awesome, too.\n\nGet the Christian Louboutin \u2018So Kate\u2019 Pointy Toe Pump from Nordstrom for $725\n\nGet the Christian Louboutin Rainbow Pigalle Follies Pump from Nordstrom for $745\n\nGet the Comme Des Gar\u00e7ons PLAY x Converse Chuck Taylor Hidden heart High Top Sneaker from Nordstrom for $135\n\n19. For the old-school business person: A personalized cross-pen\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Personalized Cross Pen (Photo: Cross)\n\nA luxurious pen? Bet you didn\u2019t see this one coming. My husband is obsessed with cross-pens. He says, \u201ca cross-pen that is personalized with someone\u2019s initials or name is a classy, timeless gift for pen lovers.\u201d I cannot provide you with any tips on finding out if you are in the presence of a pen lover, but I can tell you they make a great gift for such people.\n\nGet the Cross Century II 10 Karat Gold Filled/Rolled Rollerball Pen Engraved for $229.95 from Cross\n\n20. For the home d\u00e9cor enthusiast: Gray Malin Artwork\n\nThe best luxury gifts of 2018: Gray Malin Art (Photo: Gray Malin)\n\nGray Malin is a popular photographer and New York Times bestselling author. His colorful photos of beaches and artistic shots of llamas (my favorite) are loved by celebrities and regular people alike. The shots have been featured on a line of Sperry Top-Siders and inside Away luggage (one of our top-tested suitcase makers!). If you know someone who would obsess over these photos, give them the gift of fun fine art this year with a framed print from Gray Malin.\n\nGet the Two Llamas with Pink Balloons II print from Gray Malin for $349 - $6,694\n\nPrices are accurate at the time of publication, but may change over time.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.

Oxygen tanks were also provided on the sidelines for players.\n\n\"Smoke and haze will continue to produce poor air quality over much of the San Francisco Bay through late week,\" the National Weather Service in San Francisco said.\n\nThere is some good news in the weather forecast for both the fires and smoke: The weather service said Thursday that \"a more significant pattern change appears likely during the latter half of next week with the potential for widespread rainfall.\"\n\nThe deadly and destructive Camp Fire, the source of most of the smoke, is now 40 percent contained and covers 140,000 acres, state fire agency Cal Fire said Thursday. That's up from 30 percent on Wednesday.\n\nThe fire, which has burned through about 220 square miles in Butte County, has left a wrenching toll: at least 56 people confirmed dead and 130 missing; about 9,000 homes and businesses destroyed, of which 8,800 are single-family homes.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/15/california-fires-worlds-worst-air-quality-smoke-masks/2014817002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "AP reporter recounts NorCal wildfire body search", "description": "As firefighters searched the ruins of Paradise, California for the remains of those lost in a deadly wildfire, AP reporter Gillian Flaccus was there when two bodies were found.

What\u2019s unclear is whether it\u2019s been an aberration or the first signs of decline for the 41-year-old. (AP Photo/Mark Zaleski, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 If his 19th NFL season has been at all more taxing than any of the previous 18, Tom Brady isn't willing to say so.\n\nEven if his play on the field through the Patriots' first 10 games this season might suggest otherwise.\n\nLast season, at age 40 Brady became the oldest player in NFL history to earn regular-season MVP honors.\n\nA year later, he finds himself in the throes of some his worst passing numbers in three seasons as the Patriots head into their bye week. What's unclear is whether it's an aberration or perhaps the first subtle signs of decline for the 41-year-old quarterback.\n\nIt's not as if Brady is having a disastrous year. Despite coming off a humbling 34-10 loss to Tennessee , New England still enters its bye with a 7-3 record and is on its way to capturing its 10th straight AFC East title.\n\nBrady is still completing 65 percent of his passes and has 17 touchdowns. He's done it despite having to break in new players in the receiving group, dealing with injuries at running back and seeing tight end Rob Gronkowski battle ankle and back injuries.\n\n\"We just haven't had that, I would say, overall consistency and the ability to practice together,\" Brady said. \"That's not an excuse. ... A lot of teams deal with injuries and moving parts and bringing different people in. That's just part of football. But we're trying to adjust and adapt like everyone else. Some weeks it's been better than others.\"\n\nIn recent years Brady has typically shrugged off questions about his health or any injuries he might be dealing with. It included him famously wearing a glove during the playoffs last season to shield the extent of a cut he sustained on his throwing hand prior to the AFC championship game.\n\nThat same, guarded posture has extended to all inquiries about whether any of the hits he's taken this season have affected his performance.\n\nAsked Wednesday about how he was feeling physically heading into the bye week, Brady smiled before saying, \"Pretty good, pretty good.\"\n\n\"Some bumps and bruises, but I think that's part of football season and I feel pretty good,\" he added.\n\nThere's definitely been more hiccups that usual in the passing game for the Patriots.\n\nIn his first seven games this season, Brady had a passer rating of 100 or greater five times, while completing 67 percent of his passes and throwing for 16 touchdowns. He did it despite being sacked nine times during those games and tossing seven interceptions.\n\nHe hasn't thrown any picks over the Patriots' past three games, but he's been sacked seven additional times. He's also thrown just one TD pass and seen his completion rate drop to 59 percent with a passer rating of 85.1.\n\nBrady is also being asked to do more outside of the pocket, serving as a blocker on trick plays and even catching a pass during the loss to the Titans. And because of New England's injury issues at running back, Brady's number has been called more often for quarterback sneaks.\n\n\"I think we're certainly aware of that, but there's certain things that I think you have to do sometimes to win the game,\" Patriots coach Bill Belichick said.\n\nBelichick said he doesn't believe they are putting more of a load on Brady than they think he can handle.\n\n\"We'll just have to evaluate those things going forward. Not looking to do an excessive amount of them, that's for sure, but if there's a situational play or something that comes up, then I think we'd consider it,\" Belichick said. \"Quarterbacks get hit in the pocket and quarterbacks scramble and a lot of people converge on them in a hurry. So, nobody knows that better than Tom does.\"\n\nRunning back James White said the onus on protecting Brady extends across the entire offense. That includes better blitz pickup by everyone.\n\n\"Definitely need to be better just communicating and when we do \u2014 when we are on the same page \u2014 do a better job of getting Tom enough time to read the coverage out and if he decides to hold the ball, still give him enough time to do that, too,\" White said.\n\nBrady said he'll be using the time off to recharge going into the stretch run of the regular season.\n\n\"We've had a lot of weeks of football and we've got some really important ones coming up,\" he said. \"So hopefully we can learn from the things that have happened over the course of the season and use them to our advantage moving forward.\"\n\nHe said improvement must come across the board.\n\n\"The reality is for the quarterback, I can do what I can do and I need to shore things up with what I can do,\" Brady said. \"I don't think any player's really satisfied. I think we're all looking to get better and improve and we have some opportunity to do that.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He's more a fan of '80s tunes and country music.\n\nTwitter? He follows recruits, but that's about it.\n\nThe Bearcats' second-year coach hasn't kept up with all the chatter about how he's turned around a program that had bottomed out. After winning only four games each of the last two seasons, the 19th-ranked Bearcats (9-1, 5-1 American Athletic) are back on the football map.\n\n\"If there's something out there, I wouldn't even know about it,\" Fickell said. \"That's the way I've always kind of lived, and it helps me focus on what I'm doing.\"\n\nHe's got the Bearcats in contention for the league title as they travel to No. 11 UCF (9-0, 6-0) for a prime-time game Saturday on ABC, the biggest stage yet for Fickell's young team. There are 35 true freshmen on the roster and 72 percent are underclassmen \u2014 one of the reasons their emergence was so unexpected.\n\nNot even Fickell would have predicted something like this when the season began.\n\n\"I'm not saying I would have said this team had the potential to win nine or 10 games and play for a championship in January, February, March or April this past year,\" Fickell said. \"I wouldn't have said it in September or October, really.\"\n\nInstead, Cincinnati is off to its best season since 2009, when it went 12-0 in the regular season under Brian Kelly. He left for Notre Dame before the Bearcats played in the Sugar Bowl and lost to Tim Tebow's Florida team 51-24.\n\nThe Bearcats survived a few close calls early \u2014 an end zone interception in the closing seconds saved a win over Ohio \u2014 and have grown up faster than expected.\n\nMost of their experience is on the defense, which leads the league in fewest yards and points allowed. Three seniors anchor a line that is the unit's strength. Sophomore running back Michael Warren II has already set a school record with 18 touchdowns, and redshirt freshman quarterback Desmond Ridder has been solid as the games have gotten more meaningful.\n\nSenior defensive tackle Cortez Broughton remembers the reactions he got preseason when he suggested the Bearcats had the ingredients to be a first-rate team.\n\n\"People thought I was in different world, on a different planet,\" Broughton said.\n\nThey showed their inexperience before a 35-23 win over South Florida on Saturday night at Nippert Stadium. Several players exchanged words with the Bulls, and Fickell thinks that distraction played a role in Cincinnati's slow start, with South Florida leading 16-14 at halftime.\n\nWith the Bearcats headed for their first nationally televised game, Fickell talked to his players about keeping their emotions in check this week.\n\n\"I don't think we did a great job of it last week,\" Fickell said.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the Bearcats in Fickell's second season is how they've beaten teams that blew them out last year. They beat Navy 42-0 after a 42-32 defeat last season. South Florida dominated them 33-3 last year.\n\nAnd now, they face a UCF team that had its way in a 51-23 win last season at Nippert Stadium.\n\n\"Somebody said it's like a redemption tour,\" Fickell said. \"Our maturity will have to show, how we handle this stuff. We've shown it enough so far.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Ebenhack, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Luke Fickell doesn't listen to sports talk radio while driving to his office at the University of Cincinnati each morning. He's more a fan of '80s tunes and country music.\n\nTwitter? He follows recruits, but that's about it.\n\nThe Bearcats' second-year coach hasn't kept up with all the chatter about how he's turned around a program that had bottomed out. After winning only four games each of the last two seasons, the 19th-ranked Bearcats (9-1, 5-1 American Athletic) are back on the football map.\n\n\"If there's something out there, I wouldn't even know about it,\" Fickell said. \"That's the way I've always kind of lived, and it helps me focus on what I'm doing.\"\n\nHe's got the Bearcats in contention for the league title as they travel to No. 11 UCF (9-0, 6-0) for a prime-time game Saturday on ABC, the biggest stage yet for Fickell's young team. There are 35 true freshmen on the roster and 72 percent are underclassmen \u2014 one of the reasons their emergence was so unexpected.\n\nNot even Fickell would have predicted something like this when the season began.\n\n\"I'm not saying I would have said this team had the potential to win nine or 10 games and play for a championship in January, February, March or April this past year,\" Fickell said. \"I wouldn't have said it in September or October, really.\"\n\nInstead, Cincinnati is off to its best season since 2009, when it went 12-0 in the regular season under Brian Kelly. He left for Notre Dame before the Bearcats played in the Sugar Bowl and lost to Tim Tebow's Florida team 51-24.\n\nThe Bearcats survived a few close calls early \u2014 an end zone interception in the closing seconds saved a win over Ohio \u2014 and have grown up faster than expected.\n\nMost of their experience is on the defense, which leads the league in fewest yards and points allowed. Three seniors anchor a line that is the unit's strength. Sophomore running back Michael Warren II has already set a school record with 18 touchdowns, and redshirt freshman quarterback Desmond Ridder has been solid as the games have gotten more meaningful.\n\nSenior defensive tackle Cortez Broughton remembers the reactions he got preseason when he suggested the Bearcats had the ingredients to be a first-rate team.\n\n\"People thought I was in different world, on a different planet,\" Broughton said.\n\nThey showed their inexperience before a 35-23 win over South Florida on Saturday night at Nippert Stadium. Several players exchanged words with the Bulls, and Fickell thinks that distraction played a role in Cincinnati's slow start, with South Florida leading 16-14 at halftime.\n\nWith the Bearcats headed for their first nationally televised game, Fickell talked to his players about keeping their emotions in check this week.\n\n\"I don't think we did a great job of it last week,\" Fickell said.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the Bearcats in Fickell's second season is how they've beaten teams that blew them out last year. They beat Navy 42-0 after a 42-32 defeat last season. South Florida dominated them 33-3 last year.\n\nAnd now, they face a UCF team that had its way in a 51-23 win last season at Nippert Stadium.\n\n\"Somebody said it's like a redemption tour,\" Fickell said. \"Our maturity will have to show, how we handle this stuff. We've shown it enough so far.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 It's not exactly a clash of titans at State Farm Stadium on Sunday.\n\nThe Oakland Raiders, with the NFL's worst record at 1-8, drag a five-game losing streak into their game with the Arizona Cardinals, who at 2-7 are tied for the third-worst record in the league.\n\nBoth teams look at this as a game they realistically can win, while a loss will make a bad season much uglier.\n\nIt's a matchup of first-year coaches with Jon Gruden in Oakland and Steve Wilks in Arizona. It has been a bumpy ride for both.\n\n\"They're going to be ready. This is the National Football League, and I told the guys this morning that you can throw the record out the window,\" Wilks said. \"These guys are coming here to win a football game. They're down. They need a win just like we need one. So, we better make sure that we're prepared and ready to play.\"\n\nGruden knows there are those who believe his team is \"tanking\" to get a high pick in next year's draft.\n\n\"If you pay attention to that stuff, anybody that says that, I don't agree with, but I can't control what's out there,\" he said. \"We've had to make some tough decisions, and everybody's going to have their own opinion, but I know what the reality is. I know what the truth is, and we're doing everything that we feel like is in the best interest of the Raiders, not only for this year, but for the future.\n\n\"When you're the head coach, you're going to take criticism, and that's just the way it is.\"\n\nArizona's offense showed some life after Wilks fired offensive coordinator Mike McCoy and elevated Byron Leftwich to the job. In last week's loss to the Chiefs, Arizona running back David Johnson had a season-best 183 yards from scrimmage, 98 rushing and 85 receiving. He scored both Cardinals touchdowns.\n\nHere are some things to consider when the Raiders come to the desert:\n\nFITZGERALD AGAIN\n\nArizona's Larry Fitzgerald is closing in on yet another milestone. He needs eight receptions to break Jerry Rice's NFL record for the most catches with one team. Fitzgerald has played all 15 of his seasons with the Cardinals.\n\nIn last week's loss against Kansas City, he moved past Terrell Owens into second on the NFL's career list for yards receiving.\n\nREPLACEMENT RECEIVERS\n\nThe Raiders traded No. 1 receiver Amari Cooper last month and then lost two more receivers to injuries last week. Martavis Bryant will be out for at least a few weeks with an injured knee and Jordy Nelson is questionable this week with a knee injury.\n\nRookie Marcell Ateman, who has been on the practice squad or inactive all year, will get a chance alongside Brandon LaFell and Seth Roberts. Ateman showed flashes during training camp and hopes that translates this week.\n\n\"I didn't take a back seat when I got on the practice squad,\" he said. \"I kept working so that when I get my opportunity I'm better.\"\n\nBATTERED ROSEN\n\nArizona rookie quarterback Josh Rosen took some big hits in the Cardinals' 26-14 loss to Kansas City last Sunday, operating behind an offensive line that struggled even before losing starting right guard Justin Pugh to a season-ending knee injury.\n\nRosen took the physical punishment in stride, something that impressed Gruden.\n\n\"He's showing a lot of mental and physical toughness,\" the Oakland coach said. \"He has got a great arm, and he's got a huge upside, I believe.\"\n\nCAUTIOUS CARR\n\nDerek Carr has gone four straight games without throwing an interception for the first time in his five-year career. The problem is that while Carr has avoided the catastrophic mistakes, the big plays have been missing as well.\n\nCarr is averaging just 6.8 yards per attempt in that span, down from 8.1 his first five games when he had eight INTs. His sack rate has also more than doubled over the past four games.\n\n\"We had some turnovers and things like that,\" Carr said about taking more shots downfield earlier in the season. \"Turning the ball over is worse for our team than me checking the ball down if it's not completely open.\"\n\nBLIND SIDE\n\nOakland traded down with Arizona on draft day, dropping five spots to No. 15 and gaining a third-round pick in the process. The Cardinals took Rosen, while the Raiders got the left tackle they wanted in Kolton Miller and used the third-round pick to acquire Bryant.\n\nMiller has played much of the season on an injured knee and has allowed the most sacks (10) and second-most pressures (39) of any lineman in the league.\n\n\"I think he's really learning a lot about this business the hard way,\" Gruden said.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Josh Dubow in Alameda, California, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Officials in the Donald Trump administration have now learned the lesson taught many of their predecessors.\n\nBeware the power of the first lady.\n\nMelania Trump basically forced out a top national security official this week, a reminder to many that first ladies wield a unique kind of power.\n\n\"It is really surprising to see that anybody at the White House would take on the first lady so directly,\" said Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush.\n\nThe White House announced Wednesday that deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel will be moved to another job, a day after Mrs. Trump took the extraordinary step of publicly calling for her removal.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" the Tuesday statement from that office said.\n\nPrevious first ladies have weighed in on policy and personnel \u2013 Nancy Reagan famously got rid of White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan in 1987 \u2013 but they usually act behind the scenes, speaking with reporters on background.\n\nMelania Trump's public statement about Mira Ricardel appears to be unprecedented.\n\nThis even though the two have never met.\n\nMost of it stems from a dispute between Ricardel and Mrs. Trump's staff over the first lady's trip to Africa last month, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in recent days to discuss a sensitive issue that has left bruised feelings in both the West Wing and the East Wing.\n\nRicardel wanted seats aboard the first lady's plane for her and an aide, officials said. Mrs. Trump's staff said there was no room and that aides from throughout the government had been left off the manifest because of limited space.\n\nWhen aides suggested that Ricardel and others fly ahead and meet Mrs. Trump in Africa, she reacted angrily (and did not make the trip).\n\nSome officials accused Ricardel of leaking false stories and spreading rumors about the first lady's spending habits, though other officials dispute that.\n\nOfficials did not dispute that other people, beyond the first lady's office, have complained about what they consider to be Ricardel's abrasive, yelling manner.\n\nDefenders of Ricardel said she may be a tough administrator, but she is a top-notch planning and policy person who will serve the president well wherever she winds up. These officials said Mrs. Trump's statement blindsided many people on Trump's staff and was unfair in general.\n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton, who hired Ricardel in April, is in Asia this week, traveling with Vice President Mike Pence. From a distance, he tried to save Ricardel's job, but Trump opted to transfer her out and try to provide a smooth landing.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Ricardel \"will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the Administration.\"\n\nSanders added that Trump \"is grateful for Ms. Ricardel\u2019s continued service to the American people and her steadfast pursuit of his national security priorities.\"\n\nAsked in Asia about the Ricardel incident, Pence said he has \u201cgreat respect for her and her role. I look forward to her new role in another part of the administration.\u201d\n\nThe battle between Ricardel and Melania Trump's staff is only the latest installment in first lady lore.\n\nDuring the last administration, aides to Michelle Obama fought with press secretary Robert Gibbs over the handling of a disputed media report about Mrs. Obama supposedly telling French counterpart Carla Bruni that living in the White House was \"hell.\" (Mrs. Obama and Bruni said the comment was never made.)\n\nIn 1987, Nancy Reagan believed Chief of Staff Regan was out for himself, not the president.\n\nThe last straw for that first lady: The chief of staff hung up on her during an angry phone call. Regan, however, eventually got some revenge: He used his memoir to talk about how Mrs. Reagan used an astrologer to help set the president's schedule.\n\nMcBride, executive in residence with the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, said most White House employees know \u2013 or should know \u2013 the power and authority of first ladies.\n\nIf they didn't, she said, \"they certainly learned through this.\"\n\nContributing: Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/15/donald-trumps-team-learns-old-lesson-careful-first-lady/2011372002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 7 West Virginia tries to stay atop Big 12 standings", "description": "No. 7 West Virginia tries to stay atop Big 12 standings against Oklahoma State", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/15/no-7-west-virginia-tries-to-stay-atop-big-12-standings/38537531/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:35:29Z", "content": "No. 7 West Virginia (8-1, 6-1 Big 12, No. 9 CFP) at Oklahoma State (5-5, 2-5), 3:30 p.m. EST (ABC) Line: West Virginia by 4\u00bd.

The senior continues to shine, ranking ninth in the nation with 2,961 passing yards and is fifth with 31 touchdown passes. He has also completed 69 percent of his passes (207 for 300).\n\nOklahoma State: QB Taylor Cornelius. The fifth-year senior/first-year starter enjoyed a monster game last week against Oklahoma, completing 34 of 53 passes for 501 yards and three touchdowns, vaulting into fifth in the nation in yards passing, with 3,123. He needs to have another big day for the Cowboys to have a shot at defeating West Virginia.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nOklahoma State has won the last three meetings. . West Virginia has won 21 consecutive games when leading at halftime and is 48-6 under Holgorsen (since 2011) when holding a halftime advantage. . Oklahoma State's 48-47 loss to No. 6 Oklahoma last week dropped the Cowboys' record to 16-5 in their last 21 games decided by 10 points or less.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But attorney Michael Avenatti is using a timeworn denial in his recent arrest in Los Angeles on suspicion of felony domestic violence abuse and subsequent release on bail. His accuser is unnamed.\n\n\"I have never struck a woman. I never will strike a woman. I have been an advocate for women\u2019s rights my entire career and I\u2019m going to continue to be an advocate. I am not going to be intimidated from stopping what I am doing,\" Avenatti toldreporters Wednesday, and his two ex-wives backed him up.\n\nBlanket denials don't stand up to the statistics\n\nIt has been a big couple of weeks for domestic violence denials and attacks on the credibility of accusers. Following accusations of domestic violence against Congressman Keith Ellison, now Minnesota's attorney general-elect, Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, simply stated recently, \"I don't believe her.\"\n\nThis dance of diffusion of responsibility is nothing new. And there are likely some false accusations among the millions of alleged crimes. Still, it is time to examine the blanket dismissals on their face and to contemplate logically why it is preposterous for a woman \u2014 or man \u2014 to fabricate a domestic violence claim.\n\nMore: I am a sexual assault survivor, and I don\u2019t want you to just take my word for it\n\nKavanaugh Yale classmate: FBI investigation was a joke. I tried to help and was ignored.\n\nI was falsely accused and my reputation was disparaged. I don't regret fighting back.\n\nTo put it into context, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in its 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey that \u201cmore than 1-in-3 women (35.6 percent) ... in the United States have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.\u201d\n\nThat means if you are a woman sitting in a movie theater, with one woman to your right and one woman to your left, one of you will experience domestic violence \u2014 or already has.\n\nMore than 1-in-4 men (28.5 percent) will be victims of domestic violence, according to the CDC, and this includes both women and men as perpetrators.\n\nTelling a competent medical professional is not what most victims do. Just 21 percent of female victims and 6 percent of male victims disclosed their victimization to a doctor or nurse in their lifetime.\n\nThe Department of Justice reports that according to a 2016 survey, less than half, or 44 percent of all violent victimizations were reported to police. Domestic violence is only one type of violent victimization, but the reticence to report in domestic violence is also a factor.\n\nEvery minute, nearly 20 people are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States, according to The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. That adds up to more than 10 million women and men every year, or nearly the total populations of Moscow or Sao Paolo, Brazil.\n\nI find it hard to believe that 10 million people in this country are liars.\n\nThe risks of coming forward\n\nTelling anyone you are a victim is exposing your full-on shame. That is because shame is the shroud of silence that envelopes victims of domestic violence. Reporting is not glamorous, it is courageous. Stepping forward is an attempt to survive and move forward from the experience into the truth.\n\nI know this to be true. I was married to a man who was physically violent. After much agonizing, soul-baring contemplation and hard work, I wrote a memoir about my experience, published nearly 20 years ago. \"I Closed My Eyes\" was my own stepping into the truth, not just for myself but for millions of women \u2014 and men \u2014 who had a similar experience. It was by no measure an easy admission.\n\nThat is because the initial reaction of most people to domestic violence is incredulity, even with the ubiquity of the crime. There is no nation on the planet where the incidence of domestic violence is zero.\n\nYet, regardless of race, age, gender, ability, orientation, socioeconomic background, religion or geography, a domestic violence victim is assigned low self-esteem or was the provocateur. The victim is motivated by attention or fame, seeking money or revenge.

As Cleveland hit its bye week, and with six games left in a season going nowhere, optimism overflowed around a franchise that has had little to celebrate over the past 25 years. (AP Photo/David Richard, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The losing has slowed, but hasn't stopped for the ever-rebuilding Browns. They're in the midst of yet another coaching search, and the NFL playoffs are likely to come and go without them again this season \u2014 the 16th straight postseason since their most recent appearance.\n\nBut as Cleveland hit its bye week, and with six games left in another season going nowhere, optimism abounds around a franchise that has had little to celebrate over the past 25 years.\n\nThe dark days of despair are dwindling.\n\nBaker Mayfield is making them go away.\n\nThe fearless rookie quarterback with the contagious personality, touchdown-making skills and trash-talking bravado, has the Browns \u2014 and their long-suffering fans \u2014 believing.\n\n\"It's not everything, but it's everything,\" guard Joel Bitonio said with a smile when asked about Mayfield's magnetism and positive influence. \"You've got to have a quarterback to win in the NFL and it hasn't been perfect, but to have him out there with you, there's always that hope that, 'Hey, we have a chance to win this game.'\"\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft, Mayfield is changing the Browns (3-6-1) with his actions on and off the field. He's already endured years of chaos in just 10 games as Cleveland has changed coaches, traded its top playmaker (Josh Gordon) and leading rusher (Carlos Hyde), suffered numerous injuries and a few of those punch-in-the stomach losses that the Browns have seemingly mastered.\n\nBut every time the Browns have taken a hard hit, Mayfield has responded with one of his own.\n\n\"We've got a quarterback who knows how to fight,\" said defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah. \"You want to play for a guy like that who inspires you. He comes to the defensive side of the ball like, 'Hey, we're still in this. Just give me one more chance out there.' Guys on defense love that. They love a quarterback who can go out there and make a promise and say, 'Hey, I've got your back.'\"\n\nMayfield, who has gotten better every week, hasn't won the respect of his teammates. He's earned it.\n\nThe Browns didn't hand the starting job to Mayfield, who began the season in a backup role before starter Tyrod Taylor suffered a concussion in Week 3 against the New York Jets on national TV. Mayfield came in and led the Browns to their first win since 2016, snapping a 19-game winless streak and providing a preview of bigger things to come.\n\nIt hasn't been perfect so far. Mayfield has made his share of rookie mistakes, forcing passes, holding onto the ball too long, missing open receivers. But in the past four games, Mayfield has completed 69 percent of his passes with nine touchdowns and just two interceptions.\n\nDespite winning the Heisman Trophy and going 33-6 as a starter at Oklahoma, Mayfield wasn't considered the top prospect in this year's ballyhooed rookie QB class, which includes Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen and Josh Allen. Mayfield was too short, too cocky, too much a product of Sooners coach Lincoln Riley's system.\n\nWell, Mayfield has outperformed the other rookies across the board.\n\n\"He's developing as a quarterback,\" said Browns general manager John Dorsey, the man who went out on a limb and picked Mayfield. \"He is still a rookie quarterback. He has demonstrated certain things during the course of a game that get you excited. I think that if you would ask him as a person, he still has a lot more football to master the position that he plays. I think he will continue to do that.\"\n\nLast week, after being encouraged by interim coach Gregg Williams and his teammates to \"cut it loose and play,\" Mayfield delivered the signature performance and victory of his fledgling pro career.\n\nHe completed his first 13 passes, finished 17 of 20 with three touchdown passes and outplayed Atlanta quarterback and 2016 NFL MVP Matt Ryan as the Browns ended a four-game losing streak with a 28-16 win.\n\nFollowing the game, Mayfield smiled and said he woke up \"feeling dangerous\" before de-feathering the Falcons, who had their playoff hopes severely shaken.\n\nThe comment might have come off as cocky to some, but it was Mayfield at his playful and bragging best, displaying the swagger that made him a college superstar and has endeared him to his Cleveland teammates.\n\nMake no mistake, at 23 and only 10 games into his NFL life, Mayfield is the Browns' undisputed leader, the tone-setter.\n\n\"He's taken the role head-first, never looking back,\" said rookie running back Nick Chubb, who rushed for 176 yards in the win. \"He brings that energy and burst that we need. This team will follow him anywhere. He is just a great leader, and you know no matter what is going on around us or outside noise just the bad stuff that has not gone well for us, he is going to give us all 100 percent and he is not going to let it affect him.\n\n\"We like that in our quarterback and our leader, and he is fiercely competitive. He gives 100 percent every play. Just being on the team with him, everyone just likes it and loves him and loves who he is.\"\n\nThe praise from Chubb and others fuel him.\n\n\"To me, there is nothing better than that,\" Mayfield said. \"As a quarterback, and as somebody that wants to be a leader of this team, it does not get better than that.\"\n\nIn Cleveland, things are getting a lot better.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Regardless of his rant on social media, Jalen Ramsey would love to spend his career with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nAnd the chatty cornerback has a video game to prove it.\n\n\"I play Madden all the time. I play with the Jags,\" Ramsey said Thursday. \"I don't trade myself. I don't make any trades on the team. I play with the Jags. I lose a couple times, but I bounce back. I always bounce back. But I play with the Jags.\"\n\nFrustration is starting to surface for the Jaguars (3-6), who bolstered big hopes from reaching the AFC title game last year by starting 3-1. They haven't won since then, and their fifth straight loss last week to the Indianapolis Colts was marked by missed assignments and blown coverages.\n\nAt least one of them belonged to Ramsey, the Pro Bowl cornerback who was supposed to drop in coverage and instead played man defense as tight end Eric Ebron ran free for a 53-yard touchdown catch.\n\nThe following morning, Ramsey took to Twitter to vent about the negative blowback in Jacksonville.\n\n\"When I'm gone from here, y'all gone miss me. I ain't even trippin,\" it said.\n\nRamsey, a first-round pick in 2016, still has another year on his contract with an option that would take him through 2020. And he hopes it would go longer than that.\n\n\"I've said multiple times ... that I want to play with one team my whole career,\" Ramsey said.\n\nHe also hasn't removed the tweet or backed away from it.\n\nPressed to explain what he meant, Ramsey said it was directed to the \"fake fans.\"\n\n\"We bring some good things,\" he said. \"And yeah, we slipped up here recently, not executed and played like we know we can. But like, whoever \u2014 the fake fans, y'all, whoever \u2014 if y'all want to jump ship, then it is what it is. But y'all going to miss us when we either gone or when stuff (is) back popping. We don't want y'all no more.\"\n\nThe Jaguars are on the verge of popping themselves out of any shot at the postseason, trailing Houston by three games in the AFC South, winless since Sept. 30. Next up are the Pittsburgh Steelers, whose fifth straight victory was a 55-21 dismantling of the Carolina Panthers a week ago Thursday night.\n\nRamsey, in an interview with GQ last year, said he was more impressed with receiver Antonio Brown than quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who he referred to as \"decent at best\" and that Roethlisberger \"really disappointed me\" the two times the Jaguars beat the Steelers, including the AFC divisional playoff.\n\nWith a chance to return the favor, Roethlisberger didn't nibble when asked about Ramsey.\n\n\"He's a guy that you have to understand where he is and who he's covering and be smart,\" Roethlisberger said. \"I am not going to fear anybody \u2014 I don't care who they are. But you respect it, for sure.\"\n\nThe trick for Ramsey and the rest of the Jaguars' secondary is to look smart by knowing who they're supposed to be covering. Ramsey attributed the blown assignment against the Colts to not hearing the call from the other side of the field.\n\nWhether it's communication or formation, Ramsey is more interested in a solution.\n\n\"Not saying we don't care about the fans being frustrated, but we're frustrated in here,\" he said. \"Y'all think we just walking around and we happy about what's been happening lately? We're not. We're still trying to figure out a way that we can fix it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Mitchell Trubisky understands how high the stakes are.\n\nThe Chicago Bears have a chance to tighten their grip on the NFC North lead and demonstrate just how far they have come when they host the defending division champion Minnesota Vikings in a prime-time showdown for first place Sunday night.\n\n\"It's a huge opportunity to show the world what we're about and make a statement in our division,\" Trubisky said.\n\nIt has been a long time since the Bears (6-3) have been in a spot like this.\n\nThey endured four straight last-place finishes before a resurgence this year brought on by an offseason overhaul and the progress of Trubisky, their prized quarterback, in his second season.\n\nThey're in sole possession of the division lead for the first time since 2013. They've won three in a row for the second time this season after beating Detroit last week to snap a 10-game skid against division opponents.\n\nAnd a victory over Minnesota (5-3-1) would give the Bears their longest win streak since a six-game run in 2012. But the Vikings are also on a roll, having won four of five.\n\nBoth teams boast top-five defenses. Chicago leads the NFL with 16 interceptions and ranks second in takeaways with 24.\n\nPoints could be hard to come by for both teams.\n\n\"TV-wise, it's probably boring, you know?\" Vikings defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson said. \"Guys don't want to sit there and watch an 8-7 game, but those games are fun for us. They might not be fun for the offense, but they're still fun for us.\"\n\nSome things to know before the Vikings-Bears showdown:\n\nEYES OPEN\n\nChicago coach Matt Nagy's scheme uses a lot of pre-snap motions by running backs and wide receivers designed to confuse the defense. But the Vikings have faced plenty of that in previous games against the Rams and Eagles.\n\n\"Still got to hike the ball,\" Richardson said. \"It don't mess with us too much. Don't get caught up in the eye candy. That's it. Read your keys. They'll tell you where they're going.\"\n\nOf course, whatever Nagy has shown over the first nine games is just a snapshot of what's in that complex playbook.\n\n\"There's no doubt in my mind we're going to get new plays,\" Zimmer said, adding: \"Every week you're going to get new plays, you're going to get new formations, you're going to get new personnel groups. That's part of the NFL.\"\n\nFOR KICKS\n\nChances are, Bears kicker Cody Parkey will never have another week like this.\n\nHitting uprights four times while missing two extra points and two field goals against Detroit was just the start.\n\nJimmy Fallon poked fun at him on \"The Tonight Show,\" saying: \"In his defense, that's actually way harder to do. That's pretty awesome. Then after the game, it took him four tries to get through the locker room door.\"\n\nSeveral Chicago TV stations sent helicopters to shoot footage when he practiced at Soldier Field on Wednesday night.\n\nParkey is 13 of 18 on field goals after signing with Chicago in March. At 72.2 percent, that's below the 86.4 rate he had in his first four seasons with Philadelphia, Cleveland and Miami.\n\nSETTLING IN\n\nTrubisky debuted against Minnesota in Week 5 last season in a loss at home. He's looking a little more comfortable these days.\n\nTrubisky tied a franchise record last week with his fourth 300-yard passing game, throwing for a career-best 355 yards and three touchdowns. He went 23 for 30 and had a 148.6 rating.\n\nIn last year's game at Soldier Field, he was 12 of 25 with 128 yards. He wasn't great, either, in the finale at Minnesota, going 20 of 36 for 178 yards.\n\nPRIME TIMERS\n\nThis is one of two games on the NFL's Sunday night showcase over the next four weeks for each team.\n\nThe Bears had their game against the Rams flexed to Sunday night on Dec. 9, just like this game against the Vikings was. The Vikings host the Packers on Nov. 25 on Sunday night. They also have a Monday night game at Seattle on Dec. 10.\n\nSWEET HOME\n\nCousins grew up in the northwest Chicago suburb of Barrington, and his allegiance to the Bears held strong well after his family moved to Michigan at age 13. Walter Payton's children attended the same grade school as Cousins. His youth football coach knew Mike Singletary. His father, a pastor, held some team chapels for the Bears. Though Cousins was born more than two years after the Bears won Super Bowl 20, he was well aware of the legend of that star-studded team.\n\nCousins has played at Chicago twice, in 2015 and 2016 with Washington, but it's still a special trip, one of those games during the season \"where you pinch yourself a little bit to realize you're living a dream playing at Soldier Field on Sunday night football.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It's a journey you want the audience to believe, so we took our time in telling the story,\" McQueen says.\n\nDuring filming on location in Chicago, Davis added intense, thrice-weekly weight training sessions to her regular workout schedule.

I mean, it was ridiculous.\"\n\nBut like her Cynthia, by the time McQueen was ready to shoot the elaborate climatic heist scene, Davis was in action mode.\n\nViola Davis pulls a crew together for a robbery in \"Widows.\" (Photo: Twentieth Century Fox)\n\n\"I did feel very strong at that point,\" she says. \"I was physically able to go there.\"\n\nMcQueen enhanced the heist reality by shooting at night in a Hyde Park mansion while having Davis and crew sprint up stairs in their dark thief attire.\n\n\"We actually felt like we were in it, breaking into a house to get money,\" she says. \"There was adrenaline rushing, and it was terrifying. I\u2019m not used to doing anything like that. I don\u2019t break into homes, even onscreen.\"\n\nBut Davis felt she ultimately pulled off her character's physicality. There's one action aspect, however, about which she still doesn't feel confident: driving the escape car.\n\n\"Every single time there\u2019s a stunt that\u2019s driving, they have me do it.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAshley Moyer-Gleich is eight years removed from playing in the NCAA Division II tournament. Natalie Sago officiated her first game six years ago, and the players were sixth-grade girls.\n\nThey're in the NBA now \u2014 as part of one of the most elite sororities in the game.\n\nMoyer-Gleich and Sago are among five officials who were promoted Thursday by the NBA to full-time status, making them the fourth and fifth women in league history to have that designation. They join former league refs Violet Palmer and Dee Kantner and current official Lauren Holtkamp as women to get formally hired.\n\n\"It's difficult not to say Ashley and Natalie aren't the second and third 'women referees' being added to the staff,\" NBA vice president and head of referee development Monty McCutchen told The Associated Press. \"But true equality comes when they're just going to be 'referees' on our staff. And that's what we're really trying to achieve, this sense that their work warrants their advancement.\"\n\nThe league also promoted Mousa Dagher, Matt Myers and Phenizee Ransom to the full-time level. Dagher further adds to the diversity of Thursday's moves \u2014 he was born in Syria and moved to the U.S. as a 15-year-old in 2006. Myers spent more than a decade in the G League, and Ransom was there for six seasons.\n\n\"It's such a momentous experience, to be working toward being part of the top of your craft and joining our staff,\" Holtkamp said. \"I'll never forget getting the phone call and the same will be true for all five of these referees. And Natalie and Ashley, to know they're joining our staff full-time, I'm beyond excited for them and what this means professionally and personally.\"\n\nMoyer-Gleich and Sago have both worked five NBA games this season \u2014 three regular season, two preseason. That was enough to confirm what McCutchen and other league officials have known for some time.\n\nThey're ready.\n\n\"It's been unreal, really,\" said Sago, whose father has been a referee for more than 30 years. \"It's just been a very fast path for my officiating career and I wouldn't change it for the world. I've had great role models, Lauren being one, and other NBA referees at these camps who kept saying, 'You've got something.' And all of a sudden, bam, I got the phone call and it's such an honor.\"\n\nSago got the call from NBA senior vice president and head of referee operations Michelle Johnson as her flight from one G League game to another earlier this month was taking off. She had to wait nearly two hours before she could call her father to give the news.\n\nHer rise was also rapid: She got spotted at a Division III game in St. Louis \u2014 a Sunday afternoon game before about 15 fans \u2014 about three years ago and invited to an NBA camp.\n\n\"It's very unique, how quickly it's happened,\" Sago said.\n\nThere will be a day when Moyer-Gleich, Sago and Holtkamp \u2014 along with any other women who follow them, something that seems quite likely with 17 other women working games in the G League this season \u2014 will get judged like any other referee, without the 'female' disclaimer.\n\nThey all know that day isn't here yet.\n\n\"Everything that we do, that's in comparison to the same exact thing our male counterparts might do, will be magnified,\" said Moyer-Gleich, a standout player at Millersville University in her native Pennsylvania before starting her ref career. \"What we do will be held under a microscope. Right, wrong, indifferent, I have come to peace with that.\"\n\nPalmer worked 919 contests before retiring in 2016. Kantner refereed 247 games between 1997 and 2002. Holtkamp has been assigned 214 games, and former non-staff official Brenda Pantoja \u2014 who never made the full-fledged ranks \u2014 was part of seven crews in the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons.\n\nThe NBA has made hiring more women throughout the league a top priority, and that extends to the refereeing roster. Over the summer, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said it was \"a bit embarrassing\" that the league currently has only one full-time female referee.\n\n\"I know that I'm good enough,\" Moyer-Gleich said. \"I know I belong there.\"\n\nMcCutchen and other top NBA executives agree. He stressed that there was no mandate to hire women. His charge, he said, was to hire the best refs, period.\n\n\"I am committed that this be egalitarian,\" McCutchen said. \"If you can do the work, if you can stand up to the standards of our league but not the standing of our players and apply the rules, that should be open to any package it shows itself in.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Authorities say 130 people are unaccounted for. (Nov. 15) AP\n\nA search and rescue worker searches a car for human remains at a trailer park burned out from the Camp Fire, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, in Paradise, Calif. (Photo: John Locher, AP)\n\nPARADISE, Calif. \u2013 The roving teams of forensic anthropologists have come from across the region to find the dead. They wear boots and masks, and use gloved hands and trowels to carefully pick through the ash of the quick-moving inferno. Their task is complex, delicate and harrowing \u2013 find those who were unable to escape the flames, identify them and give closure to families desperately searching for reunification or at least certainty.\n\nIt is unlike anything anyone here has ever seen before. At least 63 people have been found dead in recent days, making the 215-square-mile Camp Fire the deadliest in California history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all human \u2026 no matter how many (recoveries) you do and how good you get at keeping your composure, it takes a toll on you,\u201d said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said. \u201cIt has an impact.\u201d\n\nHundreds of acres of devastation, with only piles of rubble in some places to identify where structures once stood, face the dozens of teams slowly and painfully searching the area of the Camp Fire to identify the bodies. The fire was only 40 percent contained as of Wednesday.\n\nThe task ahead is daunting. Approximately 8,756 homes have burned \u2013 thousands more than any other fire in state history \u2013 and the list of those unaccounted for stood at 631 as of Thursday.\n\nIn a charred landscape filled with the mangled remains of buildings and vehicles, the specially-trained eyes of forensic anthropologists have become crucial.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re skilled at telling the difference between burnt wood and burnt bones, and if they\u2019re bones we can tell if they are human or animal,\u201d explained Marin Pilloud, a forensic anthropologist with the University of Nevada, Reno.\n\nIn Paradise, where most of the search operation is currently centered, the grayed, singed streets are dotted with hundreds of search personnel and roving teams of forensic anthropologists who have volunteered to come and help from sometimes hundreds of miles away. They wear boots and masks, breathing air still rated \"very unhealthy\" by the state as they go about their work.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office first called nearby California State University, Chico, and then, realizing the scope of the search ahead of them, extended the request for help to universities in nearby states. Anthropologists from Chico, and universities in Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada, answered the call.\n\nSo far just three of the 56 people found dead have been publicly identified \u2013 Ernest Foss, 65, of Paradise; Jesus Fernandez, 48, of Concow; and Carl Wiley, 77, of Magalia.\n\nAs searchers continue their grim task, officials are concerned the death toll will continue to rise.\n\n\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t, but the possibility is definitely there that it could,\u201d said Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Steve Collins.\n\nSearch and rescue teams on Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018 comb through rubble looking for the remains of victims killed in the Camp Fire in Paradise, Calif. (Photo: Sam Gross/USA TODAY Network)\n\nThe search\n\nPilloud and another forensic anthropologist from Nevada, Kyra Stull, led a team of 10 students tasked with identifying remains in the rubble of Paradise and other communities. Their process is systematic, and every house presents a new challenge. Buildings don\u2019t collapse the same way, and the forensic experts are assisted by firefighters who often must cut apart large sheets of metal roofing that have \u201cpancaked\u201d on top of rubble and reinforce partially-collapsed structures.\n\nBoth Pilloud and Stull are accustomed to identifying burn victims, but what they experienced in Paradise was unparalleled.\n\n\u201cAt this scale and size of the damage, I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that before,\u201d Stull said.\n\nThe search is guided by the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office list of unaccounted for persons. When the department receives a call about a missing person, a deputy is dispatched to the address to see if the residence is still standing.\n\nIf it\u2019s unharmed by the flames, the effort to locate the person continues elsewhere. But if it was consumed by the wind-whipped inferno, it\u2019s added to the list of locations needing visits by search teams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of urgency,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe have all these people that want to know the status of their loved ones, and they\u2019re depending on us to get the answers for them. The longer that time goes on without those answers, I can sense that the frustration will build.\u201d\n\nSearch crews are also sifting through the rubble of commercial buildings where they suspect people fleeing the flames may have attempted to take refuge.\n\nReports of missing elderly and those who are immobile give the sheriff\u2019s office \u201cmore indication\u201d their residence may need to be searched, Collins added.\n\nSearch and rescue teams on Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, comb through rubble looking for the remains of victims killed in the Camp Fire in Paradise. (Photo: Sam Gross/USA TODAY Network)\n\nIdentifying those who died\n\nAs they are found, the remains are first carefully cataloged at the site, noting where they were discovered, the movement of the fire and the surroundings.\n\nAn osteologist, a scientist who studies bones, would be used to document the context and gather all possible information so that all the anatomical elements of the person could be gathered together even if the fire had caused them to be dispersed, said Christopher Schmidt, a professor of biological anthropology at the University of Indianapolis.\n\nInvestigators look for bone features. For example, in a younger person, the ends of their bones would not have fused together, while in someone older they would have. Bones can also be used to tell size, sex and in some instances race, as well as whether someone was fine-boned or more robust.\n\nWhile that wouldn\u2019t help in identifying the remains of an entirely unknown group, such as sometimes happens in mass graves, in this instance who is missing, and who might have been together with whom, is known and could make sorting easier, said Schmidt.\n\nIn most circumstances, context helps identify people but that can become difficult if people were racing to leave, said Schmidt, who co-edited the forensic text The Analysis of Burned Human Remains.\n\n\u201cIf someone\u2019s not where they were expected to be, if they were out on a road or they got turned around or they were not in the vehicle that was registered to them, for example,\u201d he said.\n\nSearch and rescue teams on Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018 comb through rubble looking for the remains of victims killed in the Camp Fire in Paradise, Calif. (Photo: Sam Gross/USA TODAY Network)\n\nOnce all the information that can be gleaned from the site is noted down, the bodies are transported to the Sacramento County Morgue for autopsy. Two mobile morgue units have also been requested from the Department of Justice to assist in the identification efforts.\n\nThere, investigators will first attempt more traditional means of identification, such as using fingerprints.\n\nIf fingerprints aren\u2019t an option, they will attempt to identify victims through dental records. This is done by taking an X-ray of the teeth or jaw and then comparing it with X-rays from the person\u2019s previous dental visits. Because the shape and placement of fillings is highly individual, finding matches is relatively easy. It\u2019s also possible to compare the internal anatomy of the teeth, said Schmidt.\n\nHowever, there is concern that some of those records may have been lost in the blaze.The town of Paradise, and many of the surrounding communities known colloquially as \u201cParadise Ridge\u201d by locals, is a near-complete loss. It\u2019s easier to count the few buildings and homes still standing than it is to count the buildings destroyed.\n\nAmong the destroyed buildings are many dentist\u2019s offices. It\u2019s unclear how many of those are gone, but it\u2019s likely the dental records inside them were destroyed, too.\n\nAt that point investigators would turn to dentists the victims might have seen previously, but it can be a long process. \u201cIt can take months to find the old family dentist, especially if someone once lived back East, for example,\u201d said Schmidt.\n\nDestruction caused by The Camp Fire near Paradise, Calif., Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018. (Photo: SCOTT CLAUSE, USA TODAY Network)\n\nDNA testing\n\nBecause so many of the bodies are believed to have been burned beyond recognition, officials are asking family members of those missing to submit DNA samples to see if they match any of the still-unidentified dead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding remains in various states, some of the people badly burned,\u201d Honea said. \u201cSome of them have been reduced to bone, and I suspect that there are some that have been completely consumed.\u201d\n\nMaking a plea for DNA samples from relatives even before all the victims had been recovered is \"unprecedented,\u201d said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea. \u201cNobody has ever had to do this before.\u201d\n\nPeople who suspect their missing loved one is among the dead are being asked to submit a DNA sample at the sheriff\u2019s office. That would generally be a cheek swab, said Celeste Berg, a professor of genomic science at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nOnly a tiny bit of tissue or bone is necessary to do DNA matching, said Berg.\n\n\u201cAll you need truthfully is one cell. As long as there\u2019s some tissue that didn't turn into ash, you can get it,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce the bodies are in the morgue, the coroner's office would look for any tissues that still had some structure to them. \u201cThey would take a Q-tips swab or cut a little piece and put that into a small tube, and then that would be sent to the lab where they extract the DNA,\u201d Berg said.\n\nIf no tissue is present, it\u2019s still often possible to get DNA from teeth.\n\n\u201cTeeth are a great place for DNA because that enamel cap is 99 percent mineral, so it will protect the DNA that\u2019s inside,\u201d said Schmidt.\n\nOnce the sample is collected, a process called amplification is used to make many copies of the person\u2019s DNA. Then, using FBI protocols, 20 specific regions on the person\u2019s genome, which are highly variable person to person, are analyzed.\n\nThat analysis would then be compared with the database of relatives searching for their loved ones who have given DNA, and matches would be made.\n\nThe testing must be done by federally- or state-approved labs using certified technicians. The tests themselves only take a few days, but state labs are typically so backed up with regular cases that it can take months to get an answer, said Berg.\n\nIn this instance, a private rapid DNA profiling company, called ANDE, is assisting in the effort to identify victims free-of-charge, which should speed up the process tremendously.\n\nThat said, given the large number of victims and the need to gather DNA samples from family members, it could take weeks or even months to match all the victims, the experts cautioned.\n\nLast resort\n\nIt is possible that prolonged, intense heat could result in the victim being so burned that their bones and teeth are calcinated, leaving only minerals and making DNA identification impossible, said Victor Weedn, a professor of forensic sciences at George Washington University.\n\nInvestigators will likely then turn to \u201ccircumstantial evidence,\u201d according to Honea.\n\nThat evidence could be the location of the victim, the age of the remains or sex. Honea added circumstantial evidence is a difficult way to try to identify a person and often is very uncertain.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the search for victims will need to go on. While many of those reported missing have been found safe, there are still families waiting for word on their loved ones.\n\nIt's that work that keeps the searchers going.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we know we\u2019re providing closure to someone, or helping a situation or facilitating identification,\u201d said Stull, the forensic anthropologist from the University of Nevada, Reno.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/15/california-fire-long-hard-process-identifying-dead-underway/2006860002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Bengals, Ravens have issues heading into pivotal clash", "description": "The Baltimore Ravens aren't certain who will start at quarterback and coach Marvin Lewis will run the Cincinnati Bengals defense Sunday in a pivotal AFC North clash", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/15/bengals-ravens-have-issues-heading-into-pivotal-clash/38537081/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ecc886f6421a83092f73ef2ac6f56d530bf4d3b9/c=0-246-4716-2899/local/-/media/2018/11/15/USATODAY/usatsports/e37735fa3bc143dba3920059d602d057.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:57:58Z", "content": "FILE - In this Dec 31, 2017, file photo, Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tyler Boyd (83) reacts as he scores the winning touchdown as Baltimore Ravens cornerback Brandon Carr (24) lies on the ground during the second half of an NFL football game in Baltimore\u2026 [+5136 chars]", "fulltext": "FILE - In this Dec 31, 2017, file photo, Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tyler Boyd (83) reacts as he scores the winning touchdown as Baltimore Ravens cornerback Brandon Carr (24) lies on the ground during the second half of an NFL football game in Baltimore.

Quarterback Andrew Dalton's 49-yard touchdown pass to Boyd on a fourth-and-12 play with 49 seconds left sent the Bengals to a 31-27 win that kept Baltimore out of the playoffs and gave the Bills their first postseason appearance since 1999. (AP Photo/Nick Wass, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Joe Flacco's sore right hip means Ravens coach John Harbaugh may have to wait until Sunday before deciding who to start at quarterback in a pivotal game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nHarbaugh's options are Flacco, an ailing 11-year veteran; Lamar Jackson, a rookie who's never made an NFL start; or Robert Griffin III, who's been inactive every game this season.\n\nRather than fret, Harbaugh attempted to put a positive spin on the situation.\n\n\"It just makes it tougher for the Bengals to prepare for us,\" he said. \"So, that's kind of a good thing.\"\n\nActually, Cincinnati coach Marvin Lewis couldn't care less. He's got his own problems, most notably a horrific defense that set a dubious Super Bowl-era record by yielding at least 500 yards in three successive games.\n\nLewis fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday and assumed the responsibility of running the defense with the aid of Hue Jackson , who was hired Tuesday after being dismissed as head coach of the Browns earlier this season.\n\nAsked to describe his wild week, Lewis said quite sarcastically: \"Yeah, it's what you wish for.\"\n\nThe Ravens (4-5) and Bengals (5-4) fully expected to be in a better place with seven games to go. After a 4-2 start, Baltimore has lost three straight. The Bengals have dropped four of five after opening 4-1.\n\nThe importance of this game for both teams cannot be understated.\n\n\"Us and Baltimore at this point are where we need this win,\" Cincinnati receiver Tyler Boyd said. \"It's a huge game to make or break a team.\"\n\nRavens cornerback Marlon Humphrey said: \"When you come off three losses, you definitely know you definitely have to win.\"\n\nSome other things to know about this AFC North matchup:\n\nNO GREEN?\n\nOverlooked in the Bengals' defensive collapse in a 51-14 loss to the Saints last week was how the offense struggled without receiver A.J. Green, sidelined with a toe injury.\n\nThe Bengals put together a 75-yard touchdown drive on their opening possession, and the starters didn't score again. Cincinnati wound up with 284 yards. Andy Dalton was only 12 of 20 for 153 yards with four sacks and two interceptions. Green was initially ruled out for the Ravens game on Friday, but the Bengals did an about-face and held open a slight chance he'd play by listing him as doubtful.\n\nThe receivers know they must do better in Baltimore.\n\n\"We need to make more plays on the ball,\" Boyd said. \"When Andy puts the ball in the air, we need to fight for the ball or at least not let the opponent get the interception.\"\n\nCOACH AND QB TANDEMS\n\nLewis has been coaching the Bengals for 16 years, and Harbaugh is in his 11th season with Baltimore.\n\nAsked to find the common thread between the two, Lewis said, \"If you look around the league, the people who have been in these jobs for a long time, they're fortunate to have quarterbacks that lead the franchise and win games. I guess that, to me, is the main commonality.\"\n\nFlacco has been Harbaugh's starting quarterback since 2008 , and they've won a Super Bowl together. Dalton has a 68-48-2 record as a starter over an eight-year run.\n\nSCENE OF THE GRAB\n\nThe Bengals return to the place where they broke the Ravens' hearts and made the Buffalo Bills giddy with one big play in the final regular-season game last season.\n\nDalton's 49-yard touchdown pass to Boyd on a fourth-and-12 play with 49 seconds left sent the Bengals to a 31-27 win that kept Baltimore out of the playoffs and gave the Bills their first postseason appearance since 1999.\n\nBills fans donated more than $450,000 to Dalton's foundation in gratitude, and the quarterback was warmly received at a preseason game in Buffalo last August.\n\n\"It was one of the coolest moments of my career, with everything that happened on the play and afterward,\" Dalton said.\n\nJACKSON READY\n\nIf Flacco can't go, Jackson will likely get the call. The 2016 Heisman Trophy winner and former Louisville star has thus far been used periodically in running situations and is second on the team with 139 yards rushing.\n\nJackson said it would be \"awesome\" to start, but has no complaints about this current role.\n\n\"It's been pretty cool,\" he said. \"I'm on the field. I'd rather be out there than just sitting down.\"\n\nGOOD BYE\n\nThe Ravens are 8-2 following a bye under Harbaugh and an NFL-best 13-3 since 2002 after getting an extra week off.\n\nAsked how he spent the week, Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs cracked up the media with this quote: \"As (NBA guard) Kyle Lowry would say, 'I got a chance to decompose.' It's kind of fun just to get your mind away a little bit.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joe Kay in Cincinnati contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Haussman has a few hotel secrets.\n\nHe's a former editor for a trade publication, and now a podcaster hosting multiple shows, including No Vacancy (NoVacancyNews.com) and \"Checking In With Anthony and Glenn,\" which he co-hosts with Travel Channel\u2019s \"Hotel Impossible\" star Anthony Melchiorri, and keeps one eye on news that affects the average traveler.\n\nSo I asked Haussman to share his hotel secrets for a better stay at a time when they are much needed. We're heading into the busy holiday travel period, with soaring room rates and full hotels. I wondered how people like Haussman cope with the craziness. He says knowing who owns the hotel, minding the mandatory fees, and knowing where to book can save you a lot of holiday hassles.\n\nHotel secret No. 1: Who owns it?\n\nHaussman says few guests understand what's happening behind the scenes at a hotel.\n\n\"It's a question of real versus perceived ownership,\" he says. \"This is the real key to understanding how to be a winner when staying at hotels. Who truly owns and operates them?\"\n\nThough common years ago, now it\u2019s rare for the name on the building to be the operating entity. Nearly all hotels are franchised and either owner-run or operated by hotel management companies on behalf of an ownership group.\n\n\"The company\u2019s name on the building provides marketing, reservation and business tools, but is removed from the hotel\u2019s day-to-day business,\" explains Haussman. \"Always ask who manages or owns the hotel upon arrival. Also, there\u2019s typically a plaque on either side of the front desk which has that information.\"\n\nSo, if you have a problem during your stay, direct it to the management company or owner, not the hotel brand\u2019s customer service line. He says you'll get quicker and, in some cases, better service than going through the hotel chain.\n\nHotel secret No. 2: Watch those resort fees!\n\nWhile Haussman considers himself a \"passionate supporter\" of the hotel business, he is no fan of hotel resort fees. The mandatory fees, added to your bill after an initial price quote, are an irritant to guests and consumer advocates. But for now, they are legal.\n\n\"Resort fees are a scourge,\" he says. \"They create an antagonistic relationship with the customer, which is antithetical to everything the hospitality industry is supposed to be about.\"\n\nThe truth is, customers are willing to pay a fair or premium price for an experience they desire. Hotel operators needn\u2019t add a fee to realize their profit goals.\n\n\"My fear is there will be more of these fees in the future such as parking fees for hotels in suburban neighborhoods,\" he says.\n\nIf you plan to stay in a hotel with a resort fee, call the property and negotiate your room rate directly, he advises.\n\n\"Many guests don\u2019t realize the fairest deals are achievable by speaking directly with the hotel\u2019s general manager,\" he says.\n\nIf you're checking in and find a resort fee on your form, refuse to initial it. If you leave it blank, you can later dispute the charge on your credit card.\n\nMore: Las Vegas resort fees: How a $25 room becomes a $65 room\n\nHotel secret No. 3: Book here, not there\n\nLately, maybe you've heard hotels urging \u2013 begging \u2013 guests to \"book direct.\" Haussman says there's a good reason for it. Hotels pay intermediaries such as online travel agents big fees to deliver guests to the hotels. Talk about poetic justice.\n\n\"So, when you see a rate of $100 on both an online travel agency and the hotel\u2019s website, the property makes more money when you book through them as opposed to a third party,\" he says, \"As much as 20 percent more.\"\n\nThat\u2019s why hotel guests booking through a third party don\u2019t get loyalty points and often feel as if they\u2019re not being treated the same as other guests. It's because they're less profitable.\n\nHaussman says the big industry secret is that independent hotels pay higher service fees to online travel agency sites than chain hotels. You're better off calling the hotel directly and booking by phone.\n\n\"Most hotels, especially independent hotels, will be happy to give you a 5 or 10 percent discount to save online travel agency fees,\" he says. \"They\u2019ll make more money giving you a discount than if you pay a higher rate to someone else.\"\n\nTips like these might not make Haussman the most popular guy at a hotel conference. But he says over the long run, being honest and transparent helps not only consumers, but also the industry. And in a business obsessed by short-term gains, that makes him worth hearing.\n\nMore hotel secrets for a better stay\n\n\u2022 Leverage your loyalty. \"If you have great status with one hotel company but want to try another, most brands will give you a status match,\" says Haussman. That way, you needn\u2019t start from zero when sampling the brands within another company\u2019s hotel portfolio.\n\n\u2022 Go for the new hotel. \"Always look for the newest hotels where you\u2019re staying,\" he says. \"They\u2019ll typically have the fastest internet speeds and largest-screen TVs, plus everything\u2019s new.\" Also, frequent travelers are more likely to get the best upgrades, since it takes up to a year or more to ramp up a new hotel\u2019s business.\n\n\u2022 Remember, not all operators are equal. Now that you know who owns and operates that great hotel where you just stayed, ask which other properties they run. Most operate hotels flying flags from several of the major hotel companies as well as independents. \"Then stay at those for even more great service experiences,\" he says.\n\nChristopher Elliott is a consumer advocate.

Kansas State won 21-17. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury spoke glowingly of the fan base at Kansas State, where no matter how much the Wildcats are winning or losing, they always seem to make it a tough road environment.\n\n\"It's a great home-field advantage,\" said Kingsbury, who has experienced it as both a player and a coach. \"They show up, they're loud (and) the players feed off it.\"\n\nThe Red Raiders visit the Wildcats on Saturday, and the comments were striking given their loss to Texas last week. Thousands of fans left their home game in the third quarter, which has become all-too-common at Texas Tech, and missed a fourth-quarter rally that fell just short.\n\nKingsbury was asked afterward about fans leaving and said: \"That's kind of par for the course right now with our fans. We've got to win, and they've got to stick around.\"\n\nThe comments raised some eyebrows around the program, particularly given Kingsbury's increasingly tenuous situation. He arrived at Texas Tech as the golden boy-come-home, the star quarterback who had returned to Lubbock to help the program reach the same heights it did under Mike Leach.\n\nBut he's had winning records just twice in his first five seasons, and the Red Raiders (5-5, 3-4 Big 12) have lost three straight to fall in danger of missing a bowl game again. They need to beat the Wildcats (4-6, 2-5) or Baylor down the stretch to reach the requisite six wins.\n\n\"Really, I think about the seniors,\" Red Raiders wide receiver Antoine Wesley said. \"I want to do as much as I can for them to make sure that we can go to a bowl game and extend their season.\"\n\nKansas State is trying to do the same thing.\n\nThe Wildcats need to sweep their final two games against the Red Raiders and Iowa State, though, after losing close games to TCU, Baylor and Texas this season. And pressure is clearly mounting, with Kansas State not making any players available to media this week.\n\nAsked whether it's been a tough year on the seniors, who will be playing their final home game, Kansas State coach Bill Snyder replied: \"I think it's been a difficult year for everybody.\"\n\nThat includes the 79-year-old Snyder, whom many are starting to believe will retire after the season.\n\n\"I don't think there's a game they don't diligently want to win,\" Snyder added. \"I have a high degree of confidence that's what they're feeling.\"\n\nHere are some story lines to watch:\n\nQB SITUATION: Texas Tech's Alan Bowman is unlikely to play against the Wildcats, though Kingsbury didn't rule him out early in the week. The freshman sustained a partially collapsed lung against West Virginia, then had a recurrence of the injury against Oklahoma. \"We just want to make sure he's healthy and forego another episode with that lung,\" said Kingsbury, who will likely turn again to sophomore quarterback Jett Duffy for the third time this season.\n\nSPEAKING OF QBS: Alex Delton's running ability saved the Wildcats last week against Kansas, but he's been banged up for weeks. Fellow starter Skylar Thompson has also been dealing with injuries, forcing the Wildcats to contemplate using freshman John Holcombe in the remaining games.\n\nBARNES THE BEAST: The Big 12's leading rusher Alex Barnes surpassed 1,000 yards for the season in the Wildcats' win over the Jayhawks. \"They have a solid run game,\" Texas Tech linebacker Jordyn Brooks said. \"He's one of the better backs in the league, in my opinion.\"\n\nROAD WARRIORS: Texas Tech may be one of those rare teams that plays better on the road than it does at home. The Red Raiders beat Oklahoma State in Stillwater and won at TCU this season. \"I think it's a close-knit group,\" Kingsbury said, \"so when they go on the road and it's an us-against-everybody mentality, they thrive off that and play really well, and come out with great intensity in all the opposing stadiums we've been in. Hopefully, that continues.\"\n\nINJURY REPORT: Red Raiders linebacker Dakota Allen could return this week after breaking his hand against Iowa State. He played through it against Oklahoma the next week, only to hurt his left knee and miss the last three quarters of the game. \"We thought he could go last week and he wasn't able to,\" Kingsbury said. \"We want to be smart and right by him.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Russell LaBounty, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nJeff Skinner hasn\u2019t been Alexander Mogilny-good in his first six weeks wearing a Buffalo Sabres jersey. But his 13 goals in 18 games has been a reminder of how fun it can be in Buffalo when a Sabre is filling the net with regularity, as Mogilny did years ago\n\nSkinner\u2019s 59-goal pace is well short of what is necessary to chase down Mogilny\u2019s team record of 76 in 1992-93. But Skinner\u2019s production has helped Buffalo go 7-2-2 in its last 11 games and pull within three points of the Tampa Bay Lightning for the Atlantic Division lead.\n\nThis is a noteworthy start for a team that has missed the playoffs for seven consecutive seasons.\n\nThe Sabres gave up prospect Cliff Pu, plus second-, third- and sixth-round draft picks for Skinner, who is serving as Jack Eichel\u2019s left wing.\n\nFirst-quarter trade grade: A\n\nWithout question, Skinner has been among the most productive offseason trade acquisitions.\n\nHere is how some of the others grade out in the first quarter:\n\nRyan O\u2019Reilly, St. Louis Blues\n\nGrade: A+\n\nEvaluation: Too much has gone wrong for the 6-7-3 Blues this season, but not their trade for O\u2019Reilly. With 21 points in 16 games, O\u2019Reilly is on pace to have the best season of his career. The 10-season veteran has never registered more than 61 points. O'Reilly has won more than 62% of his faceoffs.\n\nMax Domi, Montreal Canadiens\n\nGrade: A\n\nEvaluation: The Canadiens and Arizona Coyotes traded one disappointing player for another: Domi to Montreal and Alex Galchenyuk to Arizona. The Canadiens are thrilled with the trade because Domi, 23, looks to be maturing with 10 goals and 22 points in 18 games. The Habs were looking for an offensive spark and he has provided it.\n\nMax is also comfortable playing in a media-crazed city because his dad, Tie, played in Toronto for most of his NHL career. That's important.\n\nMore: Barry Trotz reflects on whirlwind: From Capitals' Stanley Cup to resignation to Islanders' coach\n\nMore: Fired Joel Quenneville will be the Blackhawks' gift to another team in the NHL\n\nBut the Coyotes would probably still make the trade. Despite starting the season with an injury, Galchenyuk boasts eight points in 10 games. He's the scoring center they desired.\n\nErik Karlsson, San Jose Sharks\n\nGrade: C-\n\nEvaluation: With no goals, eight assists and a plus-minus of -9, Karlsson has been statistically underwhelming. He remains the best offensive defenseman in the game, but his plus-minus is the worst on the Sharks. Brent Burns, for example, is +3. It\u2019s possible Karlsson is trying too hard and forcing too much instead of relying on his instincts. Even considering Karlsson\u2019s subpar start, the Sharks would still make this deal. They don\u2019t need Karlsson to be exceptional in October and November. They need him to be exceptional in April, May and June.\n\nMax Pacioretty, Vegas Golden Knights\n\nGrade: C-\n\nEvaluation: Pacioretty's impact has been undermined by an injury that kept him out for four games. He has only two goals in 15 games. That\u2019s a 10-goal pace for a left winger who has scored 30 or more goals five times. Injuries to Paul Stastny and Erik Haula haven\u2019t helped. Pacioretty needs to replace the scoring of James Neal, who left the Golden Knights for the Calgary Flames via free agency last offseason. Extra credit for Pacioretty if he can dial up his physical game.\n\nVinnie Hinostroza, Arizona Coyotes\n\nGrade: B-\n\nEvaluation: Acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks in the deal to move Marian Hossa\u2019s contract, Hinostroza has won over the Coyotes with nine points in 17 games. He is currently playing on the third line with Michael Grabner and Brad Richardson. That trade had other benefits for Arizona because Jordan Oesterle has been a third-pairing defenseman."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Sara M Moniuszko, USA TODAY", "title": "Pregnant Amy Schumer reveals she's been hospitalized for severe morning sickness", "description": "Actress and comedian Amy Schumer took to Instagram to reveal she is in the hospital with hyperemesis, or severe vomiting and morning sickness.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/15/pregnant-amy-schumer-hospital-hyperemesis-cancels-shows/2014830002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/07/USAT/dbef6166-a21b-4969-b44e-d5c8ff11a655-AP_People-Amy_Schumer_Pregnant.jpg?crop=3435,1958,x0,y70&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:50:24Z", "content": "Comedian Amy Schumer and husband Chris Fischer are expecting their first child.

(AP Photo/Jack Dempsey) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 While most of his new teammates were relaxing on beaches or attending football games at their universities during Houston's bye week, Demaryius Thomas was at NRG Stadium studying the playbook and watching film.\n\nThomas, who was acquired from Denver on Oct. 30, didn't have the luxury of a break. The receiver had too much to catch up on after struggling at times in his Texans debut in a 19-17 win over his former team just five days after the trade.\n\nHe had three receptions for 61 yards in that game, but had a false start, lined up in the wrong spot and looked lost on a drive in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I don't even want to have to deal with that again,\" Thomas said. \"It was two critical downs where it could have hurt us in the game, but it didn't. So I stayed here, got situated and I was in the playbook.\"\n\nThomas believes his extra work will make things smoother Sunday when the Texans travel to face the Redskins. The game will also be emotionally easier for Thomas since it isn't against the team with which he spent his entire career before the trade.\n\n\"I feel way better,\" he said. \"I ain't playing the Denver Broncos, a team I was playing for for nine years also. So with the weeks in and preparation still going on, I feel a lot better.\"\n\nThe Broncos honored Thomas, who was their first-round pick in 2010, with a video tribute before the game which featured some of the top touchdown receptions from his time in Denver. He acknowledged that seeing that and then lining up against his former team made the day rather emotional.\n\n\"Yeah it was,\" he said. \"It was tough.\"\n\nBut he'll have no such distractions Sunday when the Texans, who lead the AFC South, face another first-place team in the Redskins, who sit atop the AFC East standings.\n\n\"Both teams are 6-3, both teams are finding ways to win and that's the main thing about this league is getting a W at the end of it,\" he said. \"We're looking forward to it.\"\n\nThe Texans traded for Thomas after Will Fuller, who ranks second on the team with 503 yards receiving, suffered a season-ending knee injury. Now that Thomas has gotten up to speed with the Texans, coach Bill O'Brien is looking to get him more involved this week.\n\n\"We've got to be able to use him more, even more than we did,\" O'Brien said. \"He had three catches. I think they were all basically almost on the first or second drive of the game ... I think we're going to make a lot of strides with him from week to week.\"\n\nThomas said he has spent a lot of time with quarterback Deshaun Watson and receiver DeAndre Hopkins since his arrival in Houston. But he doesn't ask them a lot of questions. He simply watches them at practice to figure out how he's supposed to do things.\n\n\"I've been able to catch on fast since I've been in the league, so it's just stuff that when we're on the field and we're going fast, those are things that I really need because I haven't heard them before,\" Thomas said.\n\nWatson said the transition has been made easier since he had a relationship with Thomas before the trade.\n\n\"It's been good,\" Watson said. \"We've known each other before, so as far as hanging out and just talking ball, we've done that before. Now, being on the same team and having more time, especially, the past bye week of getting together and getting on the same page, it's been good.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., drew a line against President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans on Wednesday, promising to vote against new federal judges unless the Senate protects special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nFlake\u2019s last stand: Protecting Mueller\n\nDon\u2019t give up on Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., just yet. Really.\n\nI know what you\u2019re saying, \"We\u2019ve been fooled before by his tough talk, which then was followed by no action.\"\n\nTrue.\n\nBut what\u2019s happening now in Washington, D.C., is Flake\u2019s last stand, his final opportunity to add some bite to his bark.\n\nAnd he\u2019s showing some teeth. What does he have to lose?\n\nLast week, the day after President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Flake announced that he and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware would try to force action on a bill to protect the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nTrump had boasted about being the impetus for Flake leaving the Senate. He said of Flake, \"I retired him. I\u2019m very proud of it, I did the country a great service.\"\n\nAfter Flake's announcement about the bill to protect Mueller, the president tweeted Friday: \"Jeff Flake(y) doesn't want to protect the Non-Senate confirmed Special Counsel, he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the 'crime' of doing a terrible job! A weak and ineffective guy!\"\n\nTalker: Fox News, Tucker Carlson need to take accountability for their words, too\n\nSign up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nA lot of us might have thought that was the end of it. More talk. No action. But Flake hasn\u2019t backed off. He said Wednesday, \"I have informed the majority leader (Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.) that I will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee, or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting a confirmation vote on the floor, until (the bill to protect Mueller) is brought to the full Senate for a vote.\"\n\nFlake's decision on the Senate Judiciary Committee would keep those confirmations from going forward. His vote on the Senate floor \u2014 if joined by one other Republican \u2014 would stifle those confirmations as well.\n\nMcConnell has blocked any vote on the bill to protect the Mueller investigation. But is protecting Mueller necessary? He says it isn't.\n\nSince Trump forced Sessions to resign, however, then filled the attorney general spot with a man who has been critical of the Mueller investigation, it seems a lot more necessary now.\n\nFlake can't do this alone, though. He needs help from other Republicans. Even so, he\u2019s taking a stand. He\u2019s doing something.\n\nThe temptation, after all this time, is to say it's too little too late.\n\nNo.\n\nInstead, I'm going with something the nuns in my parochial grammar school told me \u2026 on numerous occasions: It\u2019s never too late to do the right thing.\n\nEJ Montini is a columnist at The Arizona Republic, where this column first appeared. You can follow him on Twitter: @ejmontini.\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nGood on Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. President Donald Trump's supporters are already crying wolf and melting. Honestly, it's not a bad deal Flake's extending. We know that Republicans are all about those federal judgeship confirmations.\n\n\u2014 Matthew Farmer\n\nThis is just a weak attempt to paint Trump in a negative light. Trump has said over and over that he has no intention of firing special counsel Robert Mueller, and it makes absolutely no sense that he would do so now that it appears that Mueller is finishing. Even Republicans would jump Trump if he dismissed Mueller now. This is just another meaningless ploy from liberals (yes, I think Flake is a liberal) to damage Trump.\n\n\u2014 Robert Parrott\n\nLooks like Trump's trickle-down corruption has taken over Republican leadership. If Trump did nothing wrong, then he should welcome a complete investigation to clear his name. He sure is acting like somebody guilty of something.\n\n\u2014 Joe Gilardone\n\nAbout time a Republican showed some backbone. Trump threw in Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker because he's scared as hell of Mueller.\n\n\u2014 Walt Stasinski\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nTiana Lowe, Washington Examiner: \"Consider the 11th hour timing, the considerably low stakes and the outlandishly high collateral, and you have pure political posturing. If anything, it's vintage Jeff Flake: a grand tableau vivant of opposing President Donald Trump, while sacrificing basically nothing to get it.\"\n\nChris Lu, Twitter: \"Trump has wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller for a long time. So while Flake\u2019s new effort to protect the Mueller investigation is commendable, he would've been more successful if he had withheld his vote on tax cuts or Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation. Too little, too late.\"\n\nAllahpundit, Hot Air: \"I wonder if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would be as resistant to a floor vote on Flake's bill as he is if the House were set to remain in Republican hands next year. With a GOP House that\u2019s strongly loyal to Trump, McConnell might have allowed the Senate to pass it, trusting that House Speaker Paul Ryan's caucus would kill it before it ended up on Trump\u2019s desk and tempted him to issue an embarrassing, controversial veto.\"\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/15/robert-muellers-investigation-protection-jeff-flake-talker/2012088002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "USC getting key contributions from young defensive linemen", "description": "The play of defensive linemen Brandon Pili, Jay Tufele, Marlon Tuipulotu and Jacob Lichtenstein has been a bright spot for USC this season", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/15/usc-getting-key-contributions-from-young-defensive-linemen/38536993/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/be66a14d7383a2809b5c5b6c0417180cecf976f8/c=0-82-4200-2444/local/-/media/2018/11/15/USATODAY/usatsports/f3189e1f0058454eb4811927ef36f0ec.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:41:21Z", "content": "California quarterback Chase Garbers (7) throws a pass under pressure by Southern California defensive lineman Marlon Tuipulotu (51) during the first half of an NCAA college football game in Los Angeles, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.

(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Optimism has been hard to come by at Southern California this season, but the play of defensive linemen Brandon Pili, Jay Tufele, Marlon Tuipulotu and Jacob Lichtenstein has been a bright spot.\n\nThe four have combined for 12 1/2 tackles for loss and 6 1/2 sacks, with the second-year players looking like the difference-makers the Trojans have lacked up front for nearly a decade.\n\n\"I think the sky is the limit,\" Pili said. \"We've all developed so much from last year and we still have a lot of developing to do. Everything that we have accomplished this year, it's imperative, and I think the jump between this year and next year is going to be even better.\"\n\nDominance and depth on the defensive line were integral to the unprecedented success USC had in the 2000's under coach Pete Carroll. While the Trojans (5-5, 4-4 Pac-12) have continued to produce standout defensive linemen such as Leonard Willians following Carroll's departure at the end of the 2009 season, USC has not had the overwhelming talent in the trenches that allowed Carroll to deploy waves of productive run stuffers and pass rushers.\n\nCoach Clay Helton wanted to address that issue in USC's 2017 signing class, bringing in four defensive linemen, with Lichtenstein coming to the West Coast from Weston, Florida, to join the three big men recruited inside the Pac-12 footprint.\n\nTufele and Tuipulotu knew each other as two of the most sought-after recruits in the country. Pili, who was born in Alaska but moved to Oregon for his final year of high school, and Lichtenstein were not as highly regarded. However, they immediately bonded and realized the immense potential of the group as soon as they arrived on campus.\n\n\"We clicked and we just became brothers,\" Tufele said. \"We never want to see each other fail or not succeed, so we always push each other every day since we have been here.\"\n\nPili was the only one of the four to play extensively as a freshman, making 14 tackles and blocking a field goal to help USC win its first conference title since 2008. Tuipulotu took a medical redshirt after appearing in three games before sustaining a back injury that would cause him to miss the rest of the season. Tufele and Lichtenstein were both redshirted.\n\nAll four have carved out regular playing time this season and have made their presence known in recent weeks. Tufele returned a fumble 48 yards for a touchdown against Utah and the four have combined for six tackles for loss and four sacks in the past two games \u2014 against Oregon State and California.\n\nHelton said they have been just as effective in allowing the inside linebackers to make plays in USC's 3-4 defense.\n\n\"They don't garner all the attention,\" Helton said. \"They just free up linebackers. When your linebackers are making tackles in the hole, it's usually because you got two 300-pounders in there that are taking the double teams.\"\n\nOccupying blockers and creating penetration will be keys against UCLA (2-8, 2-5) at the Rose Bowl on Saturday. The Bruins are averaging 155.9 yards rushing per game in conference play, and redshirt junior Joshua Kelley has run for 100 yards in five of seven Pac-12 games.\n\n\"I think they are a fast group,\" Tufele said. \"Tempo, we just have to match that and show them how physical (we can be) and just get to the ballcarrier.\"\n\nPili did not practice Wednesday because of an ankle injury, but expressed optimism he would be available against UCLA.\n\nIf Pili is limited or not able to play, the rapid progression of Tufele, Tuipulotu and Lichtenstein has Helton confident USC has plenty of options to pick up the slack.\n\n\"I tell you what, all our first- and second-year players right now are doing a wonderful job,\" Helton said. \"Now (Tufele and Tuipulotu) are sitting here as redshirt freshmen with three years left to play, Pili with two and Jake with two, so the future is bright on that defensive line.\"\n\nNOTES: Quarterback Matt Fink (broken ribs) has resumed practicing this week, but Helton has not decided whether Fink or redshirt freshman Jack Sears would back up starter JT Daniels against UCLA.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Troy Wayrynen, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMost of the attention during the college football season is focused on the College Football Playoff race. However, there's also significant drama at the bottom of the postseason picture.\n\nTo fill all the spaces in the 39 bowl games this season, 78 teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision must finish with six or more wins. If that doesn't happen, teams with five wins will be added to the mix.\n\nHere's the current situation involving the 129 teams eligible to play in the postseason (Mississippi is ineligible) with three weeks left in the regular season:\n\n\u25ba 64 teams have at least six wins.\n\n\u25ba 30 teams already have seven losses.\n\n\u25ba The 14 spots available must be filled by the remaining 35 teams.\n\nHere are some of the key games this week that will determine if the field is complete:\n\nUSC (5-5) at UCLA\n\nThe Trojans haven't missed a bowl game in a season they were not under NCAA sanctions since 2000. Beating their biggest rival would be a great way to confirm their postseason inclusion with Notre Dame coming to town next week. But the Bruins certainly will be relishing their opportunity to spoil things in the battle of Los Angeles.\n\nBoston College at Florida State (4-6)\n\nSpeaking of impressive streaks, the Seminoles have been to a bowl game in every season since 1981. Now there's no margin for error if they want their run to continue. Florida State looked overmatched in road games at N.C. State and Notre Dame. A win against the Eagles, however, would make next week's showdown with Florida quite interesting.\n\nWest Virginia at Oklahoma State (5-5)\n\nThe Cowboys need to bounce back quickly after their heartbreaking loss to Oklahoma. This is their home finale, and they've already taken down Texas in Stillwater, so a major upset isn't out of the realm of possibility. A loss will mean they'll have to pull out a victory at TCU to get a sixth win.\n\nWisconsin at Purdue (5-5)\n\nIt's been an up-and-down campaign for the Boilermakers, who started 0-3 before reeling off five wins in six games, including defeat of ranked teams Boston College, Ohio State and Iowa. A bad loss to Minnesota curbed that momentum. Beating the Badgers is necessary to avoid heading to Indiana, where both the Old Oaken Bucket and a bowl berth would be on the line for both teams.\n\nMiami (Fla.) (5-5) at Virginia Tech (4-5)\n\nThe Hurricanes and Hokies started the season ranked No. 8 and No. 17, respectively, yet here they are in desperate situations with two weeks left. Hoping to extend its 25-year bowl streak, Tech is reeling, mostly due to injuries. The good news is the both of its remaining games are at home and perhaps that can be the impetus for a turnaround. Miami hosts Pittsburgh next week.\n\nTexas Tech (5-5) at Kansas State (4-6)\n\nIf this is to be the last season for Bill Snyder, sending him off in a bowl game will require a defeat of the Red Raiders and a win next week at No. 18 Iowa State. Tech, for its part, fell just short of taking down Texas last week and will need to rebound quickly for a road trip that could get emotional if K-State fans are anticipating it will be the last time Snyder will be coaching in the stadium named in his honor.\n\nTCU (4-6) at Baylor (5-5)\n\nThe Horned Frogs have missed a bowl game in just two of the 17 seasons under Gary Patterson. But their play recently does not provide a glimmer of hope of a reversal. For the Bears, a bowl in Matt Rhule's second season after a 1-11 debut would show significant progress. There's another chance to get No. 6 next week against Texas Tech.\n\nMissouri at Tennessee (5-5)\n\nGiven up for dead, the Volunteers suddenly have bowl life after beating Kentucky. The Tigers locked up their spot last week, so this is a good situation for Jeremy Pruitt's team to keep the momentum rolling and continue the encouraging signs of progress in his first season.\n\nPittsburgh at Wake Forest (5-5)\n\nNeither the Panthers or Demon Deacons looked to be in position for a bowl game halfway through the season. The former is now already eligible and a win away from locking up the ACC Coastal division. The latter surprised N.C. State last week to put itself on the brink of the postseason. A win in the home finale would do the trick for Wake with a trip to rival Duke up next.\n\nUtah at Colorado (5-5)\n\nIt's not been a great week for the Buffaloes, who lost to Washington State to extend their skid to five games and then heard rumors of the firing of coach Mike MacIntyre. An upset of the Utes would certainly change their fortunes, clinching both a bowl game and may keep their coach around for a while longer.\n\nNorthwestern at Minnesota (5-5)\n\nA trip to rival Wisconsin awaits the Gophers next week, so beating the Wildcats looks like their best opportunity to avoid missing out on the postseason for the second time under P.J. Fleck. Perhaps Northwestern is soaking in its Big Ten West title too much this week. That would help, though Minnesota showed its potential last week in a rout of Purdue."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Bengals' Lewis back to doing what he loves: running defense", "description": "Joyful return: Bengals coach Marvin Lewis is back to running a defense, one of the things he loves most.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 The joy shows on Marvin Lewis' face. The Bengals coach is back to doing what he loves \u2014 running a defense.\n\nCan his return to his football roots save his team from another ignominious season? Will the 16th-year head coach get burned out doing two demanding jobs? And can he really make much of a difference on a defense that's sapped by injuries and depending upon youth?\n\nThose questions will start to get answers on Sunday when the Bengals (5-4) play at Baltimore (4-5) , the place where Lewis led one of the NFL's greatest defenses to a Super Bowl title in the 2000 season.\n\n\"I've got it,\" Lewis said, with a reassuring smile.\n\nFor the second straight season, the Bengals have plunged into a coaching makeover at midstream. They fired offensive coordinator Ken Zampese after an 0-2 start last season. The offense got better, but still finished last in the NFL as the Bengals failed to make the playoffs.\n\nThis time, it's the other side of the ball getting a severe makeover in mid-November, with no margin for error in the AFC North. The Bengals need to win Sunday in Baltimore and then at home against Cleveland the following week to keep themselves in playoff position heading into December.\n\n\"Us and Baltimore at this point are where we need this win,\" receiver Tyler Boyd said. \"It's a huge game to make or break a team.\"\n\nSensing his team is running out of time, Lewis fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday and brought back close friend Hue Jackson to help him run the defense. Few try to balance running a defense and coaching a team because of the exhausting workload during the week, let alone the challenges on game day.\n\n\"Again, there's a lot,\" Lewis acknowledged.\n\nFor now, the 60-year-old coach seems energized by the role he's carved out for himself. He enjoyed preparing the week's defensive plan at home on Monday night, just like old times.\n\n\"It's fun, I'll tell you that,\" Lewis said. \"It's exciting for me.\"\n\nPlayers are curious about how things will change on Sunday. So far, Lewis has tried to focus on basics after players struggled to execute Austin's defense. He's also pulled out some plays from previous years and added them to the week's package.\n\nThe best defensive coordinators are known for quickly adapting during games and finding ways to blunt whatever an offense throws at them. Nobody knows how Lewis will use the defensive plays differently on Sunday.\n\n\"I've never been under the reins of Marvin Lewis as a defensive coordinator, so it's going to be pretty interesting,\" defensive end Carlos Dunlap said. \"He's not going to change the defense. It's just going to be called differently. He's going to put his twist on it.\"\n\nLewis' defense in Baltimore was one of the best of all-time, allowing only 165 points \u2014 an NFL record \u2014 on its way to the Super Bowl title. The Bengals' defense is one of the worst of all time , on pace to give up a league record in yards. Cincinnati has allowed at least 500 yards in three straight games, a first in the Super Bowl era, and is coming off a 51-14 loss to the Saints.\n\nIt's also severely depleted by injuries. Four linebackers \u2014 Vontaze Burfict, Preston Brown, Nick Vigil and Vincent Rey \u2014 are dealing with injuries, along with cornerbacks Darqueze Dennard and Dre Kirkpatrick.\n\nJackson sat in the back of the defensive room while Lewis unveiled the defensive game plan on Wednesday with a PowerPoint presentation that included a font so small that some players had trouble reading it on the screen. Instead, the followed along on their iPads.\n\n\"We all just kind of squinted and tried to figure it out,\" linebacker Preston Brown said. \"It was kind of funny.\"\n\nWhy didn't anyone point out the problem?\n\n\"If we'd won the past couple of games, we would have said something,\" Brown said. \"But we've given up 500 yards. We're going to be quiet until we make a couple of plays.\"\n\nINJURY UPDATE\n\nBrown (knee) and Vigil (knee) were among seven players held out of practice in Thursday. Burfict (hip), Rey (groin), Dennard (shoulder) and Kirkpatrick (concussion) were limited. Running back Joe Mixon also was limited with a sore knee. Receiver A.J. Green will miss his second straight game with a toe injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Clippers won 121-116 in overtime. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Draymond Green isn't apologizing for his part in a dustup with Kevin Durant that led to a one-game suspension by the Golden State Warriors.\n\nBut Green vowed Thursday that the Warriors are not imploding, regardless of whatever is, or isn't happening, following the heated exchange between he and Durant in Monday night's overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nGreen said he and Durant have spoken and that they're \"moving forward.\"\n\nThe Warriors forward spoke on Thursday for the first time since the incident. He opened his session with reporters by saying: \"I'm going to speak on this one time and one time only,\" and refused to take any questions about it after he was done.\n\n\"I think there's no secret that I am an emotional player,\" he said. \"I wear my emotions on my sleeve. I play with that same emotion. Sometimes they get the best of me. And (if) it doesn't work to my favor I'm going to live with that.\"\n\nHe continued by saying that the passionate way he plays the game has led him to much success in his career.\n\n\"It works in my favor to the good as my resume speaks and this team's resume speaks more so than it doesn't,\" he said. \"So I'm never going to change who I am.\"\n\nIn the closing seconds of regulation during Monday's 121-116 overtime loss on the road to the Clippers, Green secured a rebound and, with Durant calling for the ball, instead dribbled the length of the court into traffic and lost control as the Warriors failed to get a shot off. Durant was shown on camera visibly upset immediately afterward.\n\nThen, back on the bench waiting for the extra period to begin, the two traded words and gestured with Klay Thompson seated between them and Andre Iguodala, DeMarcus Cousins and others trying to calm the situation.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Durant and Green have been involved in a verbal altercation. In another overtime loss, 109-106 at Sacramento on Feb. 4, 2017, they shouted at each other and argued near the bench.\n\nCoach Steve Kerr confirmed that Green and Durant have spoken but refused to divulge any details.\n\n\"I can tell you that I am extremely confident in this team's ability to get through any adversity,\" he said.\n\nKerr said he's also talked to Green about the incident but that he wanted to keep what was said private. However, he did rave about Green and what he's done for the Warriors in his seven seasons with the team.\n\n\"We've been through too much together,\" Kerr said. \"We've won championships. We've lost a Game 7 in the Finals. We've had all kinds of ups and downs and I know Draymond's got a huge heart. He's a champion. He's a winner and he's so passionate that at times he can go over the edge. He always comes back and I know he's going to come back and he'll be his usual competitive, passionate self and we're going to move on.\"\n\nGreen, 28, seemed amused by stories that have been written and sports commentators who have wondered if the discord between he and Durant will cause the former league MVP not to re-sign with the Warriors next year, or if it will ruin the team's chances of winning its third straight title.\n\n\"What you must know is that nobody in this organization from a player, not myself, not Kevin, not anybody else is going to beat us,\" Green said. \"So if you one of them other 29 teams in this league you got to beat us. We not going to beat us. We going to continue to do what we do and I'm sorry if that ruins everybody's stories. I know everybody got a job to do. I apologize for ruining y'all's stories if it did.\"\n\nGreen, who is averaging 7.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.4 assists this season, went on to say that he believes dealing with this situation will galvanize the team and make it even better in the future.\n\n\"If this only makes Kevin, myself and the rest of my teammates stronger, that's what it's going to do,\" he said. \"So you think you saw something before, good luck with us now. .... We're not going to crumble off of an argument. We (are) going to move forward.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

USA TODAY\n\nDuke's Zion Williamson is averaging 25.3 points per game and shooting 82% from the field. (Photo: Rob Kinnan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nZion Williamson doesn\u2019t belong in college.\n\nWith every game he plays, every opponent he dismantles, every did-you-see-THAT highlight he produces, the Duke freshman shows why the NBA needs to scrap its ridiculous \u201cone-and-done\u201d rule. Three games into his college career, it\u2019s clear Williamson is more ready for the NBA than some of the guys already there.\n\nLook, going straight to the NBA from high school isn\u2019t right for every player. In fact, it\u2019s probably not the right move for most.\n\nAs dominant as they were in high school or on the AAU circuit, the NBA is a different world and the year or two players spend in college \u2013 maybe even three or four \u2013 could make the difference between having a long, successful career and joining the list of phenom flameouts. Some need the coaching and competition they\u2019ll get in college, while others need to get stronger.\n\nMore: Former LSU assistant coach offered Duke's Zion Williamson a football scholarship\n\nMore: Shaky win over Southern Illinois leaves No. 2 Kentucky with even more questions to answer\n\nBut there are some players with the maturity, on the court and off, to go directly to the NBA, and the league\u2019s insistence on a one-year moratorium to their entry hasn\u2019t done anyone any good. Not a league whose popularity revolves around transcendent players. Not a college game where the competition is so wildly lopsided.\n\nAnd not a player like Williamson, who might be the guy to carry the NBA in the post-LeBron world.\n\nIn his first three games at Duke, Williamson is averaging a double-double with 25.3 points and 10.7 rebounds, and he\u2019s shooting 82%. Yes, you read that right. Williamson is shooting 82% from the floor.\n\nHe\u2019s doing this despite limited playing time. Against Eastern Michigan on Wednesday night, he scored 21 points, grabbed nine rebounds and had a jaw-dropping dunk in all of 21 minutes.\n\nAgainst then-No. 2 Kentucky last week, he was on the floor for just 23 minutes yet scored 28 on 11-of-13 shooting and had seven rebounds.\n\n\u201cOh, he was good today. Whoo,\u201d Kentucky coach John Calipari said after the game, a 118-84 win for Duke. \u201cHe got some shots off on big guys that were trying to block it. I thought that would bother him and it absolutely did not bother him today.\n\n\u201cWe had a 7-footer in there and a 6-11 (guy), and he drove right at them,\u201d Calipari added. \u201cI\u2019m like, holy cow.\u201d\n\nBut Williamson is big, too. As in football player-size big. Whether he\u2019s the 285 pounds he\u2019s listed at or the 270 pounds coach Mike Krzyzewski said is his playing weight, it should come as no surprise that a former LSU assistant once offered Williamson a football scholarship.\n\nWhat makes Williamson so dazzling, however, is that he doesn\u2019t play like a traditional big man. Sure, he dunks and rebounds and protects the paint as if he\u2019s a guard dog. But he has a sweet shooting stroke \u2013 you don\u2019t get to 82 percent if all you\u2019re doing is chucking it \u2013 and is deceptively agile.\n\n\u201cMore so than how high he jumps is his incredible body control, especially on a fast break,\u201d Krzyzewski said. \u201cYou would not think slither is a word you would ever use with him and basically he does that. Which is crazy.\u201d\n\nNo, what\u2019s crazy is that Williamson was barred from the NBA this year because of an arbitrary rule.\n\nWhile perhaps well-intentioned at the time it was implemented, \u201cone-and-done\u201d no longer makes sense. Not when athletes in other sports are turning pro as teenagers, and entrepreneurs are dropping out of school to jump-start their careers.\n\nIf someone has the talent to make it in their chosen profession, the age at which they do it is irrelevant.\n\nBesides, the NBA now has a developmental league that provides a fallback for guys who don\u2019t want to go to school but aren\u2019t quite ready for the league.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged over the summer that \u201cone and done\u201d is soon to just be done, saying the league was \u201cready\u201d to make a change. But it has to be negotiated with the union as part of the collective bargaining agreement, making it unlikely to happen before the 2021 draft. That's just silly.\n\nWhen someone makes the college game look like child's play, as Williamson is doing, he belongs in the NBA. Now.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "NBC to use studio personnel to announce Thanksgiving game", "description": "NBC will use studio hosts Mike Tirico for play by play and Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison for analysis on its Thanksgiving night telecast of the Falcons game at New Orleans", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/15/nbc-to-use-studio-personnel-to-announce-thanksgiving-game/38536785/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:23:21Z", "content": "NEW YORK (AP) NBC will use studio hosts Mike Tirico for play by play and Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison for analysis on its Thanksgiving night telecast of the Falcons game at New Orleans.

(Photo: Wilfredo Lee/AP)\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2013 In a move that has been reported to federal prosecutors, a Democratic party official directed staffers and volunteers to share altered election forms with voters a day after the midterm election that left two major races too close to call.\n\nThe altered forms surfaced in Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties, and were referred to federal investigators as possible election fraud, as Florida counties complete a required recount in the races for governor and the U.S. Senate.\n\nBut the USA TODAY Network obtained a Nov. 7 email from Jennifer Kim, the party's central Florida deputy field director, that shows Florida Democrats were organizing a broader, statewide effort beyond those counties to give voters the altered forms.\n\nThe form is an affidavit \u2013 known as a \"cure affidavit\" \u2013 to fix signature problems on absentee ballots. The unaltered affidavits instruct the voter that it must be mailed in time for election supervisors to get it by 5 p.m. on Nov. 5. Democratic party leaders provided staffers with copies that had been modified to include an inaccurate Nov. 8 deadline.\n\n(View the unaltered form here.)\n\nOne Palm Beach Democrat said in an interview the idea was to have voters fix and submit as many absentee ballots as possible with the altered forms in hopes of later including them in vote totals if a judge ruled such ballots were allowed.\n\nU.S. Chief Judge Mark Walker ruled Thursday that voters should have until Saturday to correct signatures on ballots, a move that could open the door for these ballots returned with altered forms to be counted. Gov. Rick Scott, who leads Nelson by less than 13,000 votes in the recount, will appeal the ruling, his campaign said shortly after the judge issued the order.\n\nThe Democratic Party email was sent before U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and his party allies filed a series of lawsuits challenging some voting rules that applied during the election, claiming they disenfranchised voters.\n\nCLOSE The recount began 5 p.m. Saturday in Palm Beach County. Mary Helen Moore, mary.moore@tcpalm.com\n\nA recount is also underway in the race state agriculture commissioner.\n\nDemocratic Party Executive Director Juan Penalosa did not immediately respond Thursday to requests for comment about the use of the altered forms.\n\nThe party compiled a list of voters across the state who had their vote-by-mail ballots ruled ineligible because of signature problems.\n\n\u201cThese are people that submitted VBMs before Election Day and did not sign them properly,\u201d wrote Kim, who also served as deputy training director, in the Nov. 7 email to party staffers and volunteers.\n\nIt is not clear how many altered forms were sent across the state, but Kim's email outlined a step-by-step process for volunteers and staffers to follow in order to get as many voters as possible to submit the altered form three days after the deadline.\n\n\u201cThe voters MUST print out the form and sign it by hand,\u201d Kim wrote in the email that attached copies of the altered forms in both English and Spanish. The email also included a sheet with the contact information of all election supervisors in the state.\n\nAmong those Democrats on Kim's email was Joe Walters of Brandon, listed by the Nelson campaign as a recount contact.\n\nKim was clear that staffers should target people who submitted absentee vote-by-mail ballots before Election Day and did not sign them properly. Her email subject line said \"VBM signature cure instructions\" and labeled the list of voters to be contacted as \"VBM signature chases.\"\n\nIn case you missed it: FL agency asks U.S. prosecutors to investigate possible election fraud tied to Democrats\n\nThat same day, however, state Democratic Party Chair Terrie Rizzo wrote on a private Facebook page that efforts to fix ballots should be focused on provisional ballots, which were handled separately with a Nov. 8 deadline for voters to fix any issues.\n\n\"Hi all. Once again, to clarify: the activity taking place today is for provisional ballots. Not absentee ballots,\" Rizzo's note read.\n\nProvisional ballots do not need to be corrected to be accepted by a county's canvassing board, but voters can provide additional information to help resolve any outstanding issues. They also use a separate state form for voters to complete when filing a provisional ballot.\n\nKim's email instructed staff and volunteers to contact voters about their signature problems on the absentee ballots, to complete the form on the phone with the voter and to email the completed form to the voter.\n\nThe voter was instructed to print the form and to sign it. Kim's email instructed the party workers to tell voters to deliver the signed form to their local election office.\n\nKim told staffers that voters should reply back to them after they delivered the forms at the party's email, vote@floridadems.org. That email was also included in documents Florida election officials referred to federal prosecutors in connection to the altered forms received by Broward and the other three counties.\n\nCLOSE The recounting of Senate and gubernatorial ballots is underway in Florida's second most-populous county after it fixed problems with its machines. (Nov. 11) AP\n\n\u201cIf needed (party) staff or volunteer should go pick up their affidavit and deliver it for them if they are not able to deliver by 5 p.m. Thursday. (Each office should identify a runner that can do this.),\u201d her email states.\n\n\u201cWe will also follow with a tracking system for people who we send affidavits,\" Kim told staffers.\n\nPam Keith, a Palm Beach County Democrat, came under fire Wednesday after Republicans circulated a screenshot of a Nov. 7 deleted tweet she sent to about 22,000 of her Twitter followers, encouraging people to submit forms to fix their absentee ballots two days after the state-mandated deadline.\n\nShe then directed people to email Katharine Priegues, a field organizer with the Florida Democratic Party, with the subject line \"I want to help\" for instructions on what to do.\n\nKeith told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida that she was aware the deadline to submit those forms had expired, even though she was telling them there was still time to fix their absentee ballots.\n\n\"I was trying to show that if given notice, voters would try to fix their ballots,\" Keith said. \"I was putting the word out because I was anticipating a challenge of that deadline (in court).\"\n\nKeith knew that because the deadline had passed, it was almost guaranteed forms submitted by voters on Nov. 8 would be rejected by election supervisors, who were under \"no obligation to accept the affidavits.\"\n\n\"But better to have evidence in hand,\" Keith said.\n\nThat evidence would be a record of emails sent by voters who wanted to fix their absentee ballots but couldn't do so because they couldn't meet the state-imposed deadline.\n\nShe said she doesn't consider what she was doing election fraud.\n\n\"It is not fraud to try and correct something. There's nothing fraudulent about that,\" she said.\n\nAfter Walker's ruling to allow voters more time to fix signature problems on absentee ballots, Keith said the actions that she and other Democrats took to help voters with the altered forms were justified.\n\n\"The deadline wasn't 'wrong,' per se. It was functionally meaningless and arbitrary,\" Keith said. \"Most people never get notice, and many ballots weren't even looked at until the deadline had passed.\"\n\nThe Department of State, which oversees elections, raised concerns about the altered forms, arguing that making changes to state forms is a criminal offense in Florida. The forms were forwarded on Friday to federal prosecutors.\n\nFederal law defines election fraud to include preventing voters from participating in a federal election \"through such tactics as disseminating false information\" about the race, as outlined in an Oct. 25 letter to Florida's state department by Assistant U.S. Attorney Harry C. Wallace in Miami.\n\nWallace, who is handling federal election complaints in Florida, declined to comment Wednesday when contacted about an investigation into the altered forms.\n\n\"Making or using an altered form is a criminal offense under Florida law,\" wrote Bradley McVay, the state department\u2019s lawyer, when he referred the altered forms circulated in Broward and three other counties to federal prosecutors.\n\n\"More fundamentally, altering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect (or an incorrect method as it related to provisional ballots) imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter\u2019s ability to vote,\" he said.\n\nMore: Terms you need to know as Florida moves toward contentious recounts in several races\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/15/democrat-official-altered-election-forms/2010664002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hotel chains apologize after video shows how luxury Chinese properties 'clean' rooms", "description": "Video exposes 'cleaning' practices in Chinese hotels", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2018/11/15/hotel-chains-apologize-after-video-exposes-cleaning-practices-china/2012878002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.kgw.com/assets/GANNETT/images/1a337d7a-1433-4049-b620-296d7e301f51/1a337d7a-1433-4049-b620-296d7e301f51_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:22:23Z", "content": "BEIJING \u2013 At least four major international hotel chains apologized Thursday after hidden camera video of their room cleaning practices in China was posted online.

(AP) \u2014 Virginia's last game against a team running a ground attack like the one Georgia Tech employs could hardly have gone worse.\n\nAfter taking an early 7-0 lead against Navy in last year's Military Bowl, the Cavaliers gave up 452 rushing yards in a 49-7 defeat.\n\nThis year, as Virginia (7-3, 4-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) tries to enhance its bowl position and hang onto slim hopes for winning the ACC Coastal Division, the Cavaliers will have another chance to shut down \u2014 or at least slow down \u2014 the triple option when they play at Georgia Tech (6-4, 4-3) on Saturday. It's a place where they haven't won since 2008.\n\n\"It's not scary. It's another opportunity to get better,\" said linebacker Jordan Mack, who was part of the defense last season when the Cavaliers limited to Yellow Jackets to 220 rushing yards in a 40-36 victory. \"A lot of guys are eager and willing and want to improve and show that we can defend the triple option.\"\n\nVirginia became bowl eligible for the first time in six years with the victory last season and can match its highest victory total since 2007 with another one.\n\nBut the Yellow Jackets pose a unique challenge, especially with only one week to get ready and a defensive line that is young and dealing with injuries.\n\n\"I think I'm just going to have to make sure I lead the guys and play to the best of my ability,\" junior lineman Eli Hanback said. But he added that he must \"also help them out with any assignments and also make it imperative how important it is that they do their jobs and their assignments and their technique to the best of their ability.\n\n\"We need all 11 guys on the field more now than ever especially against triple option and all that requires.\"\n\nBesides Hanback, a three-year starter, Virginia will rely on freshmen Aaron Faumui and Jordan Redmond, redshirt freshman Tommy Christ and graduate transfer Dylan Thompson up front. That puts an onus on Mack and the linebacking corps to help implement coach Bronco Mendenhall's defensive gameplan.\n\n\"I'm very comfortable,\" Mack said. \"They piece together a good formula year in and year out, so as players, it brings us confidence.\"\n\nGeorgia Tech has used both TaQuon Marshall and Tobias Oliver at quarterback this season, and while Marshall is a better passer, he had a difficult day against the Cavaliers last season, completing just 6 of 22 passes for 179 yards with one touchdowns and two interceptions. He also ran for 143 yards and two scores.\n\nCoach Paul Johnson said both will likely play on Saturday. His team has won five of its last six games after starting with three losses in four games.\n\n\"This is a big game on Saturday,\" Johnson said, \"if we can clinch a winning season and get to seven and then you got two games left.\"\n\nThe Cavaliers' close the regular season the following week at Virginia Tech, which has won 14 straight in the series, but offensive lineman R.J. Proctor said they have gotten this far by taking the schedule one game at a time and with much left to play for, he doesn't expect them to alter their approach now.\n\n\"Yeah, we just want to go 1-0 this week,\" he said, but anyone with a Tech in their name we want to beat.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Hank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hankkurzjr\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Roebuck was being transported by ambulance. She had only given birth a short time earlier by cesarean section, or C-section, and could not yet walk on her own.\n\n\"\u201cIt was sheer terror,\u201d Roebuck recalled to ABC10. The Camp Fire is the deadliest in California's history. \u201cThey just stitched me up really quickly.\u201d\n\nThey'd only driven a half-mile when the ambulance caught fire. Roebuck said the C-section had left her numb, and she couldn't walk. With flames all around, she made what she believed was her last call to her husband.\n\n\"I realized I\u2019m not going to make it. I told [him] on the phone, 'I\u2019m really sorry.' That I just loved him and that I wasn\u2019t going to be there with the kids.\"\n\nEveryone became firefighters\n\nA pediatrician, who seemed to appear out of nowhere, had other plans.

We unlocked the garage, moved patients into this home and sheltered them in place,\" Hawks told FOX40.\n\nMORE: Dad sings to 3-year-old daughter to calm her as they drive through wildfire flames\n\nMeanwhile, nurse Tamara Ferguson, who was riding in the ambulance behind Roebuck with other patients and was making farewell calls to her own family, witnessed something amazing.\n\nEveryone who had been afraid they were dying moments before began fighting to say alive.\n\nEveryone followed the fire chief's orders.\n\n\"I see the paramedic on the roof, spraying down the roof,\u201d Ferguson told ABC10. \"I see someone over here with a hose filling buckets. Chrissy is sweeping, someone with a shovel, I picked up piles of brush and cleared them to the road.\"\n\nThe homes on either side each of the house were burned in the fire. The home Roebuck and other Feather River Hospital ambulance patients occupied only had a burned fence.\n\nRoebuck eventually went home to her family, including new daughter, Halley Ellen Harles.\n\nHalley Harles was the very last baby born at Feather River Hospital in Paradise. Her mother, Heather, had just had a c-section when they had to evacuate. \u201cThat minute that I saw her I thought was going to be the only time I ever saw her.\u201d #CampFire#latenewstonightpic.twitter.com/sQCQh6gTsz \u2014 Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) November 15, 2018\n\n'They saved our family'\n\nRoebuck is grateful to the surprised homeowner, Desiree Borden. Borden had already fled the fire along with her husband and daughter that night.\n\nBorden was shocked her home served as a refuge, as they barely made it out themselves.\n\n\"Once you got past one fire, there was another one, once you got past the next one, power poles were falling on you,\u201d Borden told Good Day Sacramento. But then her family received a call. \"They said, 'Your home was a safe haven for us, your home saved our lives.'\"\n\nRoebuck said the family and her home was a lifeline.\n\n\"They saved our family, and if it weren\u2019t for them, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\"\n\nLike All the Moms?

(Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration has focused on rolling back regulations, but its Food and Drug Administration took major steps Thursday aimed at curbing use of traditional and electronic cigarettes.\n\nThose steps, if enacted over industry opposition, will significantly improve public health.\n\nThe most important development was the FDA\u2019s move to ban menthol cigarettes \u2014 a long overdue prohibition that could transform the habits of millions of addicted smokers. For nearly a decade, the government has failed to take action against menthol, even as scientists have documented its specific harms.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW: Menthol ban will make a bad situation worse\n\nMenthol is more than a cigarette flavor. It\u2019s a chemical compound that cools and numbs the throat, making it easier for new smokers \u2014 90 percent of whom are under 18 \u2014 to start. More than half of smokers ages 12 to 17 use menthol cigarettes; among African-American youth the share is 70 percent.\n\nYoung people who start on menthol are more likely to become addicted and find it harder to quit. For decades, Big Tobacco targeted African-Americans with menthol cigarette marketing. It\u2019s long past time to end this craven strategy.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb\u2019s announcement that he will \u201cadvance\u201d a new rule to ban menthol in cigarettes and begin a separate process to ban menthol and other flavored cigars is promising, though regulations can take years to write, finalize, and take effect.\n\nThe tobacco industry has a lot at stake. More than a third of cigarette sales in 2016 were menthol. If history is any guide, the major companies will lobby their allies in Congress and the White House, and they might even seek to stop the FDA with lawsuits.\n\nIn the face of a surge in youth vaping, Gottlieb also announced new restrictions on the sale of sweet-flavored e-cigarettes. Those products could be sold only in retail outlets that restrict entrance to anyone under 18 or keep the products in a separate age-restricted section \u2014 a change expected to prevent sales at most gas stations and convenience stores. Tobacco and vape stores or any outlet, as long as it restricts entrance to adults, could still sell them. Online sales will require stricter age verification.\n\nWhether vape stores actually restrict entrance is an open question, as is how the agency would enforce this policy or what strictures will be added online. One thing is certain, none of this will be easy.\n\nGottlieb is also trying to walk a fine line by restricting sales of sweet-flavored e-cigarettes that appeal to teenagers but stopping short of restricting mint, menthol and tobacco flavors so they remain available to adults using e-cigarettes to kick their deadly smoking habits.\n\nStatistics released Thursday, months early because the findings of a national survey were so troubling, underscore how dangerous the vaping craze, epitomized by the wildly popular Juul pods, has become. E-cigarette use among high school students was up nearly 80 percent this year \u2014 and 48 percent among those in middle school \u2014 compared with a year earlier.\n\nThis year, 3.6 million middle- and high-school students have been vaping, with more than a quarter doing so 20 times during the prior month. This goes way beyond experimenting. While vaping is less dangerous than smoking, there is nothing good about creating a new generation of nicotine addicts.\n\nAnd even though smoking rates fell to record lows last year, the rates tell only part of the story. About 34 million adults still smoked in 2017, and 2.7 million middle- and high-school students smoked cigarettes and cigars last year. These are not just statistics. They are people, many of whom will die prematurely of heart disease, cancer, stroke and other tobacco-related illnesses.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s announcements are encouraging. Now comes the hard work of turning them into reality.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

In my experience, the majority of these deals tend to be just as good as those you'll find on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Plus, if you shop these deals, you can either sit back and relax with a big plate of leftovers on Friday or be even more strategic in how you shop on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\n\nAmazon tends to be a great go-to for deals all year long, but November brings a tidal wave of deeper discounts and rare sales.

Lowest price: The best convection oven (and air fryer)\n\nThis one oven can cook, bake, toast, and even air fry. (Photo: Breville)\n\nWe love the Breville Smart Oven for so many reasons. Right now, the No. 1 reason is that this typically $270 convection oven is on sale for the lowest price we've seen. We named the Smart Oven the best toaster oven we've ever tested, since it basically functions as a smaller oven while still making perfectly crispy toast. It's good for small tasks like roasting veggies or cooking a frozen pizza while your bigger oven is occupied.\n\nGet the Breville BOV845BSS Smart Oven Pro Convection Toaster Oven for $215.95 (Save $55)\n\n2. Under $100: Our favorite smart bulbs\n\nHue lights transform your home into a wonderland. (Photo: Philips Hue)\n\nIf you're still using incandescent bulbs at your house, I have one question. Why? They burn out way too fast, use too much energy, and get crazy hot, which sucks if you need to change one right after it dies. LED bulbs, on the other hand, don't get hot, last for literally years, and are way more energy efficient. And these LED bulbs in particular are even more amazing because you can control them with your phone or your smart assistant (Google, Apple, or Amazon all work).\n\nPhilips Hue Smart Bulbs are the best smart lighting option out there. I've had Hue bulbs in my house for nearly 5 years and we haven't had a single bulb die. Plus, you can choose any color you could ever want, whether you want a traditional warm white, a cool white, or maybe red or green or purple. Hue lights do it all, and right now you can get a starter kit with two bulbs and the bridge for $100, $50 less than usual. From there, you can add up to 50 lights to the bridge, so you can cover the whole home.\n\nGet the Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance 2-Bulb Starter Kit for $99.99 on Amazon (Save $50)\n\n3.

The LG C8 got a lot of attention after our expert put it through all sorts of lab tests and real-world trials and said it's the best TV he's ever seen. He also liked LG'S higher-end E8 model ($2,300 on Amazon), but the C8's combination of quality and price made it vastly superior in our book. Right now, the originally $2,500 TV discounted to $1,700, matching the lowest price we've ever seen on Amazon or at Massdrop.\n\nGet the LG C8 OLED Smart 4K TV for $1,696.96 (Save $900)\n\n3.

There, I said it. Not only is it the best electric kettle we've tested, but it's my personal favorite. I had one once and replaced it with a lesser quality kettle and have been miserable since. Right now, Cuisinart has discounted the PerfecTemp kettle to the lowest price we've ever seen, so don't miss your chance to score this usually $90 appliance for just over $60.\n\nGet the Cuisinart PerfecTemp Electric Kettle for $60.83 (Save $29)\n\n4. Under $20: One of the best travel mugs\n\nA gorgeous mug for coffee on-the-go. (Photo: Contigo)\n\nIf you commute to work, whether you drive or take a train, having a cup of coffee in tow can make the experience much better. But disposable cups from the shop down the street don't keep your drink warm for the whole ride. Plus, you have to hold them the whole time, which makes it hard to read your Kindle or scroll through Facebook.\n\nThese Contigo mugs are the best affordable travel mugs we've ever tested because they keep drinks hot for hours and hours, and they don't leak so you can toss your coffee in your bag if you don't want to carry it the whole way. The matte black is my personal favorite option, and it hadn't gone on sale all year until now.\n\nGet the Contigo Autoseal West Loop Insulated Travel Mug in Matte Black for $14.96 (Save $5)\n\nPrices are accurate at the time this article was published, but may change over time.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.

(Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nGolden State Warriors forward Draymond Green and fellow All-Star teammate Kevin Durant talked, and Green said he wants to put their issue in the past following the confrontation that threatens the stability and trajectory of the back-to-back defending champions.\n\n\u201cKevin and I spoke,\u201d Green told reporters at Thursday\u2019s shootaround ahead of a game against Houston. \u201cWe're moving forward. There\u2019s no secret I am an emotional player. I wear my emotions on my sleeve. I play with that same emotion. Sometimes, it gets the best of me, and it doesn\u2019t work to my favor. I\u2019m going to with live that because it works in my favor to the good. \u2026 I\u2019m never going to change who I am. I\u2019m going to approach the game the same way that I always do, and like I say, we\u2019ll continue to move forward.\"\n\nGreen did not say whether or not he apologized.\n\nThe Warriors suspended Green one game without pay following the verbal altercation between the two players that began near the end of Golden State\u2019s overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday and carried into the locker room. Green\u2019s decision to grab a rebound and not immediately pass the ball to Durant led to Durant\u2019s frustration, which led to Green\u2019s outburst.\n\nThe Warriors said Green\u2019s conduct was \"detrimental to the team.\" Reports from The Athletic and Yahoo Sports said Green called Durant an expletive and chastised Durant for his handling of his contract situation, which allows him to become a free agent this summer.\n\nDurant and Green took shots at the same end of the court near the conclusion of Thursday\u2019s shootaround, and according to first-hand accounts of reporters there, Green gave Durant a fist-bump after shooting their final free throws.\n\nGolden State coach Steve Kerr said the team addressed the situation but wanted to keep details private.\n\n\u201cI can tell you I\u2019m extremely confident in this team\u2019s ability to get through any adversity,\u201d Kerr told reporters in Houston. \u201cI know what this team\u2019s made of, I know the character of the group, the history of this group and it\u2019s way too strong and way too powerful to be upended by the type of adversity that can hit any team in the season. So we\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d\n\nDraymond Green\u2019s very long statement on the KD situation pic.twitter.com/itXd3a7SMP \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) November 15, 2018\n\nBoth players are necessary to Golden State\u2019s success. But if they can\u2019t co-exist and the chasm grows, the Warriors\u2019 attempt at three consecutive titles could be in jeopardy. Green doesn\u2019t believe that will be the case.\n\n\u201cNobody in this organization \u2014 not myself, not Kevin, not anybody else is going to beat us,\u201d Green said. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of the 29 other teams in this league, you got to beat us. We\u2019re not going to beat us. We\u2019re going to continue to do what we do. I\u2019m sorry if that ruins everybody\u2019s stories. I know everybody\u2019s got a job to do. I apologize for ruining your stories if it did. But if this only makes Kevin, myself and the rest of my teammates stronger, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to do. \u2026 We\u2019re not going to crumble off of an argument. We're going to move forward.\u201d\n\nIf Green was upset about Durant\u2019s contract situation, he toned down his rhetoric by Thursday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read a lot about how, \u2018Is this the end of the run?\u2019 or \u2018Is it over?\u2019 or \u2018Did I ruin it?\u2019 or \u2018Did I force Kevin to leave?\u2019\u201d Green said. \u201cAt the end of the day, as I\u2019ve said before, whatever Kevin decides to do, whatever Klay (Thompson) decides to do, whatever who decides to do, we had great years together and I support everybody wholeheartedly 100 percent. As a man, as a human being, you have the right to do what you want with your life.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Andrew Joseph", "title": "The Saints will wear white uniforms against the Eagles because Sean Payton lost a bet", "description": "It\u2019ll be Color Rush for the Saints.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/sean-payton-saints-white-home-color-rush-uniforms-bet-doug-pederson-eagles-golf-nfl", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/usp-nfl_-new-orleans-saints-at-minnesota-vikings.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:57:21Z", "content": "Although it\u2019s somewhat common to see the New Orleans Saints wear their traditional road white uniforms at home, head coach Sean Payton prefers to go with the standard home look.

(AP) \u2014 Jay Gruden occasionally has to remind people his team is in 6-3 and in first place.\n\n\"That's a heck of deal after nine games,\" the Washington Redskins' coach said. \"But I'm also excited with the fact that we have not played our best yet, and I think the best is yet to come.\"\n\nIt wasn't been a flawless ride, but when the roller-coaster Redskins host the rolling Houston Texans on Sunday, it'll be a showdown between two surprising division leaders. Washington has gotten into first place in the NFC East alternating strong and weak performances, and Houston has won six in a row to also reach 6-3 and sit atop the AFC South.\n\nLed by veterans Alex Smith and Adrian Peterson, the Redskins come into the matchup motivated by a lack of respect. Second-year quarterback Deshaun Watson and the Texans are full of confidence after digging out of an 0-3 hole.\n\n\"Winning helps,\" Houston coach Bill O'Brien said. \"Everybody has confidence in their ability to go out there and play well, but I also think our team understands that this is a very humbling league. This is a league, it's a short walk. It's a short walk from where you are right now to where you were when you were 0-3.\"\n\nIt's a very short walk for the Redskins from their best to their worst. A three-game October winning streak and last week's victory at Tampa Bay didn't show their best.\n\nSo there's reason why, despite leading the division by two games, Washington isn't getting the same buzz as other playoff contenders. Players are just fine with that.\n\n\"Nobody's really looking at the Redskins or anything,\" middle linebacker Zach Brown said. \"For us, we're just going to keep trying to stack up the wins and see where we can take it. For us, we just need an invite to the dance because you never know what might happen.\"\n\nPeterson figures it's too early to think playoffs, but said: \"You can definitely have it in the back of your mind and understand how important each and every game is.\"\n\nComing off their bye week, the Texans fully understand the value of every game to their chances of winning a third division title in four seasons.\n\n\"We have to win against the Redskins to even keep conversations like that alive,\" defensive end J.J. Watt said. \"If you start to look that far ahead and you start to think about things like that, that's when you get blindsided.\"\n\nSome things to watch when the Texans visit the Redskins:\n\nWHAT A COMEBACK\n\nWatt and Peterson are top candidates for the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year award after turning in strong performances in their return from two straight seasons that were cut short by injuries.\n\nWatt played just eight games in the previous two seasons because of back surgeries and a broken leg. Peterson missed 19 games in the 2016 and 2017 seasons combined because of knee surgery and a neck injury.\n\nWatt is tied for third in the NFL with nine sacks and tied for first by forcing four fumbles. He also has 16 quarterback hits, 11 tackles for losses and has swatted down two passes.\n\nPeterson is tied for fifth in the league with 672 yards rushing and has scored four touchdowns.\n\nWatt raved about Peterson's comeback.\n\n\"He's obviously one of the great running backs of the game,\" Watt said. \"What he's been able to do in his career, but then to be able to come back the way he has and have the type of season he's having \u2014 obviously, I know how difficult it is from firsthand experience to come back from injuries, so I'm extremely impressed by what he's been able to do. I have a ton of respect for his game. It's always a good challenge to play against him and I enjoy the competition.\"\n\nSWEARINGER REVENGE GAME\n\nRedskins safety D.J. Swearinger, who was drafted by the Texans in the second round in 2013 and cut after the 2014 season, has not been shy to rip O'Brien. He posted on Instagram this week about \"unprofessional actions\" by O'Brien that led to his release, which his former coach responded to by saying he didn't know what Swearinger was talking about.\n\n\"D.J. made a lot of plays for us here,\" O'Brien said. \"He's a very instinctive, tough, competitive player. He's obviously gone on to Arizona and now in Washington and I think he's a captain there and he's (second in) the league in interceptions, doing a great job, has got excellent ball skills, good tackler, tough, competitive guy.\"\n\nWATSON DOWN\n\nOnly the Giants' Eli Manning and Cowboys' Dak Prescott have been sacked more this season than Watson. The Texans quarterback said he tries to get back as close to the line of scrimmage as possible so as not to lose yardage on his 30 sacks.\n\nBrown has noticed on film that defenses can force sacks on Watson when they lock down on coverage because the young QB holds on to the ball so long trying to make something happen.\n\n\"I think he's just trying to make plays,\" Brown said. \"He's still young. Eventually he'll get that clock ticking in his head.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFour teams fighting for two spots in the Big 12 championship game are led by quarterbacks who've proven they can take over a game.\n\nOklahoma's Kyler Murray, West Virginia's Will Grier, Iowa State's Brock Purdy and Sam Ehlinger of Texas have been impressive and could determine which teams makes it to the Dec. 1 title game in Arlington, Texas.\n\nNo. 6 Oklahoma (9-1, No. 6 CFP) and No. 7 West Virginia (8-1, No. 9 CFP) are tied for the conference lead with 6-1 marks. No. 13 Texas (7-3, No. 15 CFP) and No. 18 Iowa State (6-3, No. 16 CFP) are next at 5-2.\n\nThe four contenders have two games left apiece. The Longhorns and Cyclones meet on Saturday. Oklahoma and West Virginia play on Nov. 23.\n\nHere's a closer look at the quarterbacks in the final weeks of the Big 12 race:\n\nTHE DUAL THREAT\n\nMurray is a two-way threat in more ways than one.\n\nMurray leads the nation with a pass-efficiency rating of 212.9, far ahead of Baker Mayfield's NCAA record of 198.9 set last season when he won the Heisman Trophy at Oklahoma.\n\nMurray is tied for third nationally with 32 touchdown passes and the speedster's 640 yards on the ground ranks seventh among Big 12 rushers.\n\nThe outfielder was the ninth overall selection by the Oakland Athletics in June's draft, then postponed his baseball career as he puts together a stellar junior football season.\n\nOutgoing Kansas coach David Beaty, whose Jayhawks play the Sooners on the road Saturday, was the recruiting coordinator at Texas A&M when he landed Murray before the athlete transferred to Oklahoma.\n\n\"It's going to fun to see him in Norman,\" Beaty said. \"He's got a moxie to him that's really unique. People are drawn to him and he's got a poise about him. You know what, he's just a fun guy to watch play.\"\n\nTHE BEARDED ONE\n\nIn two seasons since transferring from Florida, Grier is climbing the charts as one of the best quarterbacks in West Virginia history.\n\nThe senior has 31 TD passes, is averaging 9.9 yards per completion and his 329 passing yards per game are fourth nationally.\n\nAfter some struggles on offense earlier, West Virginia is averaging 49 points over its last three games, including a 47-10 win over TCU last Saturday.\n\n\"I think he's coming off his best performance yet,\" said West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen. \"He was lights out against TCU. He controlled the tempo. He understood when to push it, when to not push it.\n\n\"He's playing at a pretty high level and we're obviously going to need that type of performance moving forward.\"\n\nTHE KID\n\nA freshman, Purdy is a reason Iowa State has its first-ever five game winning streak in Big 12 play and is back in the top 25.\n\nPurdy had played one series all season before his first significant action off the bench against Oklahoma State on Oct. 6. The Cyclones entered the game last in the league in scoring offense.\n\nPurdy threw for four touchdowns in that win, and the Cyclones beat West Virginia 30-14 in his starting debut Oct. 13. He's thrown 13 TD passes and two interceptions over that five-game stretch.\n\nPurdy is completing 69 percent of his passes while averaging 50 rushing yards per game.\n\n\"The guy's undefeated,\" Texas coach Tom Herman said. \"You can tell nothing fazes that kid.\"\n\nIowa State coach Matt Campbell said Purdy plays with humility and knows he has to continue to work at getting better.\n\n\"For a young guy, he's doing a really good job for us right now,\" Campbell said.\n\nEFFICIENT EHLINGER\n\nEhlinger set a Big 12 record last week by extending his streak of consecutive passes without an interception to 280 going back to the season opener.\n\nThe sophomore had a career-high four TD passes, finding Lil'Jordan Humphrey with a 29-yard score with 21 seconds left to beat Texas Tech 41-34.\n\nHerman said Ehlinger, who started six games as a freshman, \"trusts himself a lot more than I think that he did in the past\" and now has the freedom to mix things up at the line of scrimmage. \"And for the most part he's been spot on,\" Herman said. \"He's been very aggressive without being reckless.\"\n\nCampbell said Ehlinger \"really owns the offense right now. Athletically his ability to make things happen when things break down, he's doing that at a really high rate.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nCentral Florida, led by quarterback McKenzie Milton, has won 22 consecutive games, but is not in contention for the College Football Playoff. (Photo: Reinhold Matay, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIn an interview with ESPN this week, American Athletic Conference commissioner Mike Aresco said that the treatment of unbeaten Central Florida by the College Football Playoff selection committee over the past couple of years has caused him to re-evaluate his stance on whether the playoff should be expanded beyond its current format.\n\n\u201cThe point is, I hadn\u2019t really given a lot of thought to expansion of the playoff, but I\u2019m giving more thought to it, only because it seems to me that if half of FBS is pretty much going to be left out of this then I think maybe you have to think more about it,\u201d Aresco told ESPN.\n\nFor all the talk among fans and media members about changing the current playoff, it\u2019s a pretty good indicator of far away we actually are from expansion that the one commissioner who should be pounding the table and screaming about the unfairness of this system is just now starting to consider something that the rest of the world has been considering since Day 1.\n\nAt this point, in fact, the only league that can reasonably say a four-team field is more beneficial to its interests than eight is the SEC. So why does it feel like we are still several years away from having a serious discussion about a better way to do this?\n\nOne of the major fallacies in projecting when the playoff will expand is this notion that some chaotic result is going to trigger an epiphany among the conference commissioners and cause them to scrap this thing and start over.\n\nRemember, the nuts and bolts of the CFP system were formed through a series of meetings that took place in 2012 and 2013 in which every possible scenario was discussed. The commissioners knew going into this that the SEC would probably get two teams in sooner or later. They knew that Notre Dame could get in and take a spot from a power conference champion. They knew you could have a UCF or a Boise State go unbeaten and not get a shot.\n\nThey didn\u2019t care then, so it seems highly unlikely they\u2019ll care now.\n\nInstead, there are two things that are more likely to shake the status quo than a name-brand team getting left out of the playoff under controversial circumstances: Signs of declining interest in the sport and the fast-approaching change in college football\u2019s leadership.\n\nAdmittedly, the first factor is admittedly more difficult to quantify. In 2017, Sports Business Journal found that CBS, ABC, NBC and ESPN all saw their average college football viewership decline year-over-year while Fox was up 23% due to the addition of its Big Ten package. Though somewhat alarming, that\u2019s not necessarily a perfect measurement either. Because of teams like Michigan and Notre Dame, who draw big numbers when they\u2019re winning, some of those ratings could end up higher in 2018.\n\nOn the other hand, this Saturday will be the second consecutive in which ABC\u2019s coveted primetime slot will go to matchups with limited national appeal (no offense to UCF-Cincinnati, but it\u2019s not exactly a ratings bonanza) because there were no other options. Meanwhile, any team west of Oklahoma is basically irrelevant at this point in the playoff race and the conference championship games aside from Alabama-Georgia aren\u2019t shaping up as must-watch matchups.\n\nThe entire season, in fact, has lacked some juice, which is perhaps owed somewhat to Alabama's dominance but also speaks to the major structural problem with the playoff as it stands now.\n\nIt\u2019s simply undeniable that if there were an eight-team playoff with automatic bids going to Power Five conference champions, Washington-Washington State would have huge meaning and the Big 12 championship game wouldn\u2019t need a Notre Dame loss to be must-watch TV.\n\nMoreover, the bracket that would be awaiting us after championship weekend might look something like this: UCF at Alabama, Georgia at Clemson, Washington State at Notre Dame, Oklahoma at Michigan. Just from an entertainment standpoint, who\u2019s not signing up for that?\n\nUnfortunately, rather than finding a way to make that format work, the powerbrokers have spent years explaining why it\u2019s not feasible: The academic schedule is difficult to navigate, the season is already too long and, best of all, that it would rob teams who lost in the quarterfinals of the oh-so-valuable \u201cbowl experience.\u201d\n\nAll of these issues could be worked out if the commissioners actually wanted to take control of their postseason rather than outsourcing a good portion of it to bowl game organizers. Remember, this is a sport where they are playing the playoff semifinals on Dec. 29 this year because the Sugar Bowl and Rose Bowl have priority on New Year\u2019s Day. (This would be like the Masters deciding to finish its tournament on Monday and willingly giving up the best TV time slot on Sunday afternoon to the Weed Eater Open.)\n\nNone of it makes sense, but it\u2019s going to take a new, younger group of administrators running the system to see how much potential they\u2019re currently wasting. And at some point, that will happen.\n\nACC commissioner John Swofford hasn\u2019t committed to a retirement date, but he's turning 70 in a few weeks. Bowlsby will be 67 in January. Delany has targeted 2020 as a good date to step aside, and a number of people in the college sports industry are skeptical that Scott\u2019s tenure at the Pac 12 will last more than a few years.\n\nIn other words, the entire group of people driving these decisions could look very different by the next presidential election. And with that change will come new energy, fewer ties to tradition and the bowl industry and a longer view of what college football needs to grow its popularity.\n\nAresco, who is also part of that old guard as a longtime television executive before taking over the AAC, is finally seeing the light. But if it\u2019s taken Aresco this long to realize that an eight-team playoff would be in his league's interests, the others are probably lagging even further behind."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press, Associated Press", "title": "Hotel chains apologize after video shows how luxury Chinese properties 'clean' rooms", "description": "International chains like the Waldorf Astoria and Park Hyatt apologized and promised to review their cleaning procedures after a viral video showed maids at their Chinese properties using dirty towels to clean rooms.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2018/11/15/hotel-chains-apologize-after-video-exposes-cleaning-practices-china/2012878002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/15/USAT/24532078-0dac-4258-867b-657bc61da020-d_tags_maids_dcov_25.JPG?crop=2335,1313,x1,y1564&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:31:47Z", "content": "A Marriott hotel in Hangzhou in China's Zhejiang province.

(AP Photo/James Kenney, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Tennessee Titans believe a whole new look might solve their Andrew Luck problem.\n\nHey, nothing else has worked.\n\nSince the Indianapolis Colts drafted Luck with the No. 1 overall pick in 2012, he's started nine games against the Titans and never lost \u2014 not when he played poorly, not when he left early, not even when he got hurt. So this time, the Titans are going with a different strategy in hopes of outwitting an old nemesis.\n\n\"They give you multiple looks, they're probably more multiple than any team in the league,\" Colts coach Frank Reich said. \"I look at it much like an offense, in terms of what we try to do on offense with packages, they do it on defense. They do it well.\"\n\nThe Titans (5-4) have stolen a page right out of New England's playbook and made it work.\n\nThey've allowed the fewest points per game, fewest touchdowns scored and lowest passer rating against the blitz in the league. They've moved into second place in the AFC South, one game behind Houston, by pitching consecutive second-half shutouts against Dallas' Dak Prescott and New England's Tom Brady.\n\nNow comes the hard part: Beating Luck.\n\n\"For me it's always personal going against this guy,\" said Jurrell Casey, the Titans' three-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman whose struggles against Luck also include two college losses. \"I'm always talking mess but right now I can't talk too much mess. He's got the upper hand.\"\n\nTennessee knows the story all too well.\n\nBefore sweeping Indy (4-5) last season, when Luck sat out following shoulder surgery, the Titans had lost 11 straight in the series to three different Indy quarterbacks \u2014 Luck, former Titans starter Matt Hasselbeck and Dan Orlovsky, who ended the Colts' 0-13 start with a win over Tennessee in 2011.\n\nEven in the game Luck initially injured the shoulder, Week 3 in 2015, his late rally gave the Colts their first win of the season.\n\nBut this week's challenge could be even more daunting with Luck playing some of the best football of his career.\n\nHe's thrown at least one touchdown pass in a league-high 32 consecutive games and three or more TDs in six straight games, fourth all time behind Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Dan Marino. Luck's completion rate, 66.3 percent, is a career best and he hasn't been sacked in 185 dropbacks, another career high.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Colts have won three straight and can get back to .500 \u2014 if Luck wins again.\n\n\"I'm aware of it,\" Luck said, downplaying his 9-0 mark. \"But what's happened has happened and good, bad or ugly, it doesn't really matter.\"\n\nGEARING UP\n\nThe health of Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota has improved dramatically since an elbow injury produced numbness in his throwing hand in the season opener, and it's shown. In the past two games, he's completed 69.9 percent of his passes with 468 yards, four TD passes, no interceptions and a 122.2 passer rating in victories over Dallas and New England. Mariota also caught a 21-yard pass and ran for 21 yards in last week's victory over the Patriots.\n\nLONG-TIME ACQUAINTANCES\n\nColts kicker Adam Vinatieri has been around so long he could break George Blanda's NFL record for most career regular-season wins (209) on Sunday. And he could set the new mark against one of his former teammates, new Titans coach Mike Vrabel. Vinatieri entered the league in 1996, one year before Vrabel was drafted, and then spent five years together in New England in the early 2000s before Vinatieri joined the Colts as a free agent in 2006.\n\nSHUTDOWN D\n\nIt's not just the obvious stats showing how well the Titans have played defensively. New England managed only six first downs, 117 yards and converted 1 of 7 third downs last week in the second half. The improvement also coincides with the return of strong safety Kenny Vaccaro, who missed three games because of an injured elbow. \"I think it's a credit to the players, that's what it is,\" Vrabel said. \"They get a call, and the players go out and execute. That's really what it comes down to.\"\n\nREGGIE'S RETURN\n\nFormer Colts receiver Reggie Wayne returns to Lucas Oil Stadium for his induction into Indy's Ring of Honor. Wayne spent his entire 14-year career with the Colts, playing in a franchise-record 211 games and catching 1,070 passes for 14,345 yards and 82 TDs. He's 10th in the NFL all time in receptions and yards receiving and was part of both of Indy's Super Bowl teams. Manning, Marvin Harrison, Edgerrin James, Jeff Saturday, all former teammates, have already been inducted. Tony Dungy, who coached Wayne, and former general manager Bill Polian, who drafted Wayne in 2001, have also been inducted.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Teresa Walker also contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Cracking observed in the bridge before the collapse was consistent with the design errors, according to the board, which received help in analyzing the incident from the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Office of Bridges and Structures.\n\nBesides the six fatalities, eight people were injured in the collapse March 15. Eight vehicles were crushed beneath the bridge that had been under construction above Southwest Eighth Street, and seven were occupied.\n\nThe FHA\u2019s Turner-Fairbanks Highway Research Center conducted numerous tests and examinations of concrete and steel samples taken from the bridge.\n\nDespite the collapse, the tests found that concrete samples from the bridge deck and canopy met requirements and that the concrete met Florida Department of Transportation specifications.\n\nThe $14.2 million bridge was being built under a process that allowed for installation of large sections, but one that experts said left it vulnerable to collapse until it was completed.\n\nThe structure above a seven-lane road was intended to link the university's new dorms with off-campus housing. When completed, the structure would have been 289 feet long and 109 feet tall.\n\nWhen the 950-ton bridge collapsed, a witness said it sounded \"like the world was ending.\" Rescuers clawed through the rubble to help survivors.\n\nOne part of the bridge came down on the driver's side of a car, killing the female driver but not the passenger, a witness said.

(AP Photo/Ed Zurga) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 The Kansas City Chiefs had the Cardinals' Josh Rosen seeing red last week.\n\nAs in a whole lot of red jerseys right in his face.\n\nThe Chiefs sacked Arizona's rookie quarterback five times in their 26-14 victory. They hit him 13 times, forced a fumble and generally made life miserable on a cold afternoon at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nNo wonder Rosen was asked quite sympathetically how he felt after the game.\n\nProbably like he went through a trash compactor.\n\nBut that performance by the Chiefs' much-maligned defense was closer to the norm than anything special this season. They already have 31 sacks to match their total from all last season, even though their highest-paid player and top pass rusher, Justin Houston, has missed four games to injury.\n\nThat puts the Chiefs in a tie with Pittsburgh, Minnesota and Green Bay for the NFL lead.\n\n\"Defenses right now are stretched in the National Football League. You've seen it every week,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"To be able to get the pressure that we did on the quarterback (against the Cardinals) was a huge part of it. Stepping up with big plays when needed.\"\n\nThe Chiefs struggled last season to pressure the quarterback, and there was little reason to think that would change this season. They brought back most of the same cast, though Tamba Hali stepped into retirement after an unproductive year and rookie Breeland Speaks took his spot, and defensive coordinator Bob Sutton was retained after coming under intense scrutiny.\n\nBut the Chiefs did make a couple of other important changes to the coaching staff, replacing their longtime linebackers coach Gary Gibbs with Mark DeLeone and Mike Smith. DeLeon handles the inside guys and Smith handles the outside linebackers, and by splitting up the duties both of them are able to give more one-on-one time to their players' skill-specific needs.\n\nThe progress is easiest to see in Dee Ford, the Chiefs' former first-round pick who had battled injuries and inconsistency his first four seasons. The Chiefs picked up his fifth-year option \u2014 that was no guarantee \u2014 and he has flourished when it comes to getting after the quarterback.\n\nHe has nine sacks to trail only the Rams' Aaron Donald \u2014 who will be on the field against Kansas City on Monday night \u2014 and the Vikings' Danielle Hunter. His total is also tied with J.J. Watt, Myles Garrett and Von Miller, leaving the always-upbeat Ford in some pretty select company.\n\n\"I don't think anyone in this league can block him coming off that edge one-on-one,\" said Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt, who has tried several times with little success in practice.\n\nFord isn't just getting sacks, though. He has also hit the quarterback an astounding 20 times and has four strip-sacks to give the Chiefs the ball in some crucial situations.\n\n\"Every week, that's really what we preach. When you pressure the quarterback, mistakes happen, turnovers happen,\" Ford said. \"This is just our way of playing defense.\"\n\nThe Chiefs' Chris Jones has seven sacks, including one in six straight games, and fellow defensive tackle Allen Bailey has a career-best five. Houston only has three sacks because of injuries, but he was back to near-100 percent against the Cardinals, picking off Rosen at the line of scrimmage.\n\n\"Just hitting the quarterback, affecting him in any type of way,\" Jones said. \"Helping the back-end guys out \u2014 we affect the quarterback with tips, overthrows. They could be incomplete passes or interceptions. We kind of complement each other.\"\n\nIndeed, the Chiefs' aggressive pass rush has been doubly important after their secondary had to go through some growing pains. Kansas City traded away top cornerback Marcus Peters, star safety Eric Berry has been out all season with a heel injury, and fellow safety Daniel Sorensen only recently returned to the field after breaking his leg in training camp.\n\nIn other words, it has been a mishmash of next-man-up lineups in the defensive backfield, putting even more pressure on the guys up front to help them out.\n\n\"We say every week that we've got to be willing to win the game however it presents itself, whether it's on offense, defense or special teams,\" Ford said. \"Defense actually met this week and that's one thing we spoke on: Let's take it to another level. We can't really rely, especially late in the season, off of a lot of points from our offense.\n\n\"They're tremendous,\" Ford added by way of clarification, \"but we can be tremendous also, and the same goes for special teams. Once we play like that as a unit, this team can be really great.\"\n\nNOTES: SS Eric Berry (heel) and C Mitch Morse (concussion) did not practice Thursday. ... Reid said the change in venue for Monday night's game from Mexico City didn't change his preparations. \"Other than going to a hotel in Los Angeles,\" he said. \"That's about it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Thomas Hawthorne, The Arizona Republic, via USA TODAY Network)\n\nFire crews wrangling with the most lethal blaze in California history are getting a welcome boost: Cooler, calmer weather that has descended on the northern part of the state.\n\nThe death toll at the Camp Fire, however, continued to climb on Thursday night, reaching 63 with the announcement of seven additional fatalities by Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea. The list of the missing ballooned to 631 people, though Honea said he believes \"a lot of people don't know that we are looking for them.\"\n\nThe forecast shift has helped in the containment of the vicious Camp Fire, which obliterated the town of Paradise and tore through nearby communities after igniting in a rural area one week ago on Nov. 8.\n\nAlthough the winds have mercifully calmed down, that's left the air filled with smoke and haze from the fires, leading to poor air quality in north-central California.\n\nThe blaze is now 40 percent contained and covers 141,000 acres, the state's fire agency, Cal Fire, said Thursday. That's up from 30 percent on Wednesday.\n\nOfficials have tentatively identified 53 people of the 63 deceased through DNA, Honea said. The fire has destroyed nearly 12,000 homes and businesses destroyed, of which 9,700 are single-family homes.\n\nOf the 63 fatalities, only three have been publicly identified: 73-year-old Carl Wiley, of Magalia; 48-year-old Jesus Fernandez, of Concow; and 65-year-old Ernest Foss, of Paradise.\n\nOf the dead, 52 were found in Paradise. The other eight all were found in Concow. Three were found in Magalia.\n\nOf those killed, 40 were found in homes or other buildings. Fourteen of the victims were found outside, while nine were found in vehicles.\n\nSome 52,000 people have been forced to flee; 1,385 are still in shelters. Officials reduced or lifted some evacuation orders and warnings Thursday afternoon.\n\nThanks to the calmer winds, the weather is marginally better than it was earlier in the week during the worst of the fires.\n\nDry, warm temperatures are likely to continue through early next week in northern California, the National Weather Service in Sacramento said. Breezy northeast winds are also likely over the Sierra Nevada mountains Saturday night into Sunday, which will once again elevate fire danger.\n\nBut some substantial relief could come next week: \"A more significant (weather) pattern change appears likely during the latter half of next week, with the potential for widespread rainfall,\" the weather service in San Francisco said.\n\nAccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski cautioned that \"this does not mean that the risk of high wind events has ended for the year, as a period of gusty winds may follow during the weekend right after Thanksgiving.\"\n\nMore: Death toll rise to 56 in California's deadliest wildfire; 130 remain missing at Camp Fire\n\nMore: How do wildfires start? All it takes is a spark\n\nMore: Pink's husband Carey Hart threatens California wildfire looters 'will be shot on site'\n\nFire officials, who fear the death toll could climb as evacuees return to find bodies in the singed-out shells of their homes, have begun a somber task: More than 450 searchers, many with cadaver dogs, are sifting through debris for remains in Paradise and outlying areas.\n\nOne of those areas is Magalia, a town of about 11,000 in the Sierra Nevada foothills, where many of the missing are elderly. Three bodies were found there Thursday, two inside and one outside structures, Honea said.\n\n\u201cIf this town does recover, it\u2019s going to take many, many years,\u201d said Johnny Pohmagevich, an 18-year Magalia resident who lives near many burned homes.\n\nTom Driver, the office manager and elder at Magalia Community Church, said he heard the church made it through the blaze, but he did not know whether his home survived.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to account for all of the congregation,\u201d said Driver, who is staying with family in Oakland. \u201cThey\u2019re all over the place, but they got out in pretty good time.\u201d\n\nKim Bonini left after hearing someone on a bullhorn urging people to flee. The power in her home had gone out that morning, leaving her with only her car radio.\n\n\u201cMy cell didn\u2019t work, my house phone didn\u2019t work, nothing. Nothing except for me crawling into my car,\u201d Bonini said from her daughter\u2019s home in Chico. \u201cIf I wouldn\u2019t have heard them two blocks down, I wouldn\u2019t have known I had to evacuate.\u201d\n\nIn Southern California, crews continued to battle separate wildfires. The Woolsey Fire burning west of Los Angeles \u2013 which has destroyed more than 500 structures and killed at least three people \u2013 was 62 percent contained on Thursday night, Cal Fire said.\n\nContributing: Kristin Lam, USA TODAY; Alayna Shulman, Redding Record Searchlight; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/15/california-fires-cooler-calmer-weather-helping-firefighters/2011576002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Trump visits Marines who recently helped DC fire", "description": "President Donald Trump is paying a visit to the Marine Barracks in Washington to meet with marines who responded to a recent fire at a public housing complex in the nation's capital.

The Fighting Irish could withstand a loss and still get into the playoff, but they would relinquish full control of their future. Syracuse has two games left against good opponents in the Irish and No. 22 Boston College. Win them both and the Orange are looking at their first 10-win season since 2001 and a New Year's Six bowl.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nSyracuse DEs Alton Robinson and Kendall Coleman vs. Notre Dame OTs Liam Eichenberg and Robert Hainsey. The best part of Syracuse's defense is its pass rush led by Robinson (nine sacks) and Coleman (seven). Syracuse is ninth in the country with 33 sacks. Irish QB Ian Book missed the last game with an upper body injury after dealing with the effects of a hard hit to the ribs against Northwestern two weeks ago. Eichenberg and Hainsey need to keep him safe.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nSyracuse: QB Eric Dungey. The senior has big-time talent, both throwing and running the ball. He is one of five quarterbacks this season with more than 2,000 yards passing and 500 rushing (2,193/690), a group that includes Oklahoma's Kyler Murray.\n\nNotre Dame: RB Dexter Williams. The senior missed the first four games of the season because of unspecified disciplinary reasons. He has been one of the most explosive backs in the country since returning with six runs of 30 or more yards in six games.\n\nFACTS AND FIGURES\n\nThis is a Shamrock Series game for the Irish, when Notre Dame plays home away from home. They have played Shamrock Series games in Chicago, Boston, Indianapolis and San Antonio. New York, though, has a long history of hosting the Irish, especially Yankee Stadium. Notre Dame is 16-6-3 all-time at Yankee Stadium (15-5-3 against Army), including a 1-0 in the new stadium. The Irish lost to Syracuse at Yankee Stadium in 1963 in a game less than a week after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. ... The Orange have 32 rushing touchdowns, two short of a school record set in 1998. Dungey has run for 12 scores. ... Syracuse has set a program record with five 50-point games this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It\u2019s a nod to Notre Dame\u2019s history of adventurous independence and the vision Jesse Harper, the coach of Notre Dame\u2019s first great teams, had for turning a small Catholic school in the Midwest into a national powerhouse. \u201cIt's born of that, but I think it has current value,\u201d Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said. (AP Photo/Robert Franklin, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Joe Delaney grew up in New Jersey listening to Notre Dame games on the radio with his father, who \u2014 like many blue-collar Catholics at the time \u2014 never stepped foot on the school's campus but was passionate about its football team.\n\nThe Fighting Irish were regular visitors to the New York area during the first half of the 20th century, when their wanderlust turned Notre Dame football into America's team.\n\nNotre Dame's famous Four Horsemen rode through upper Manhattan in 1924 at the Polo Grounds. When Knute Rockne implored the Fighting Irish to \"Win one for the Gipper\" in 1928, it was at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. The Fighting Irish played mighty Army every season from 1923-46, all but once in New York City and 21 times at Yankee Stadium, cultivating a huge following of so-called Subway Alumni \u2014 like Delaney.\n\nThe third-ranked Irish return to their East Coast stronghold Saturday to face No. 12 Syracuse (8-2, No. 12 CFP) in the highest-stakes college football game played at Yankee Stadium since the 1946 Game of the Century between No. 1 Army and No. 2 Notre Dame .\n\nThese Fighting Irish (10-0, No. 3 CFP) also bring national championship hopes to the Big Apple, two victories away from likely securing a spot in the College Football Playoff. Plenty of Notre Dame supporters are upset such an important game, so late in the season, is being played away from South Bend, Indiana, forcing the Irish to travel to the East Coast this week and then the West Coast next to play Southern California. That will be the second trip to California for Notre Dame in five weeks.\n\nDelaney, like most Notre Dame fans, is concerned about how all that travel will affect the players, but there is no doubt in his mind the Fighting Irish will have a home-field advantage to feed off at Yankees Stadium.\n\n\"That crowd will be as raucous and as supportive of the Irish as if they're playing in South Bend and maybe more so,\" said the 73-year-old Delaney, who did not attend Notre Dame but is a longtime member and former president of the Notre Dame Club of Staten Island. \"We don't take for granted when Notre Dame comes to New York to play. We're out there to support the team 110 percent.\"\n\nThis game is part of Notre Dame's Shamrock Series , an almost annual off-site home game the Fighting Irish have played since 2009. It's a nod to Notre Dame's history of adventurous independence and the vision Jesse Harper, the coach of Notre Dame's first great teams, had for turning a small Catholic school in the Midwest into a national powerhouse.\n\n\"It's born of that, but I think it has current value,\" Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said. \"If you're going to be independent you have to use independence. You have to take advantage of it. And a big part of that, just as it was when Jesse Harper first developed this strategy back in 1913, is you've got to be willing to travel the country and be a national brand and national presence.\"\n\nNotre Dame played Army in a Shamrock Series game in 2010 at the new Yankee Stadium and a return trip had been in the works for a while. With Syracuse on the schedule as part of Notre Dame's deal with the Atlantic Coast Conference, this seemed like the ideal season to come back.\n\nThe problem was it created a schedule in which Notre Dame played just one game in its own stadium over the last five games of the season. Further complicating the situation, Notre Dame's annual game against Navy was set to be played in San Diego on Oct. 27. When the Navy game was slotted for a night-time kickoff, Swarbrick considered the possibility of bringing the Syracuse game back on campus. After conferring with coach Brian Kelly, it was decided to leave it as is.\n\nEverybody involves knows it is not ideal.\n\nThe Irish have been tweaking routines, Kelly said, with an eye toward this late-season grind. The team stayed overnight in San Diego after the Navy game and tried to stay on Eastern time.\n\n\"All year we have avoided any unwanted travel, extra travel. We have not visited stadiums. We've gone right to the hotel. We've changed up that routine, which saves us a good hour,\" Kelly said. \"It gives us another hour or so at the hotel to rest, stretch, nutrition, recovery.\"\n\nOne loss could doom Notre Dame's playoff chances. If it comes in Yankee Stadium or on the back end of consecutive games away from home, you can bet Swarbrick and his Shamrock Series will be blamed by some fans.\n\n\"In this business when you make decisions like this, and this one goes back almost eight years in origin, you make them and you move on you don't worry about them,\" Swarbrick said. \"I'll only be nervous about the outcome Saturday.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

Meehan III, $14,698,132 to \"A Prospective, LONGitudinal and Translational Study for Former National Football League Players.\"\n\n\u2014The University of Pittsburgh and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, $6,070,384 to its \"Prevalence of Brain Health versus Neurodegeneration in Professional Football Retirees\" work.\n\n\u2014The University of Calgary, led by Dr. Carolyn Emery, $9,438,473 to \"Surveillance in High Schools to Reduce Concussions in Youth.\"\n\n\u2014The University of California-San Francisco, led by Dr. Geoff Manley, $3,454,080 to \"Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI Longitudinal).\"\n\n\u2014The Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital and Harvard Medical School, led by Dr. Grant Iverson, $1,583,138 to \"The Spectrum of Concussion: Predictors of Clinical Recovery, Treatment and Rehabilitation, and Possible Long-Term Effects.\"\n\nHaving awarded $35 million of the NFL's $40 million commitment made in 2016, the league has allocated the remaining $5 million to further medical research focused on player health and safety. The funds will be distributed under the guidance of SAB Chairman Gen. Peter Chiarelli, a retired U.S. Army general who led the Department of Defense efforts on post-traumatic stress (PTS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and suicide prevention.\n\n\"We saw their translational values,\" Chiarelli said Thursday. \"They supplemented ongoing research that already showed great promise. We were focused on the patient, and of the eight that we asked to come back and brief us for 30 minutes and answer questions, these five had the greatest opportunity to help patients, and to help understand and prevent injury in the future. That was our unified goal in picking the final five.\"\n\nCol. Sidney Hinds, an SAB Member and program coordinator for brain health research at the Department of Defense, praised the transparency of the search for grantees as well as the long-range effects their research can have.\n\n\"The traumatic brain community is relatively small when you look at other disease processes in comparison,\" Hinds said. \"Many of these groups are collaborating already, but I do believe through this SAB process, the future steps will offer another opportunity to collaborate and share information.\n\n\"I really look forward to further work and to the results these researchers will have, and to underscore the efforts they are undertaking. The results they get will not only impact professional sports but the broader general public to understand and take care of and treat concussions in the future.\"\n\nThe five honorees will present evidence of making headway to the SAB in about one year. Chiarelli is optimistic their progress will be obvious.\n\n\"We felt it was important to ask each one of them that they provide deliverables at different stages in their research timeline,\" he said. \"We asked that we would get together and see how their research is progressing. We hope not only they get to something that will help the patient, but increase the collaboration in the field, and I think this is something that will happen with this.\n\n\"We hope to come back a year from now and see how they have been able to meet the deliverables they laid out. It's very exciting.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. to riots in U.S. streets, Americans were aching for moments of unity and triumph.\n\nThe race to the moon helped provide those moments and, ultimately, filled not only Americans but humans across the globe with a rare feeling of solidarity when, for the first time, man escaped the bonds of Earth.\n\ntest\n\nAs those turbulent 12 months of 1968 drew down, it was from a sandy strip of land on Florida\u2019s east coast that the country felt a jolt of hope and inspiration.\n\nBut while the year would end with a stunning view of Earth from Apollo 8 and a Christmas Eve reading from the book of Genesis by a trio of astronauts orbiting the moon, it began somberly.\n\nIn January 1968, only one year had passed since a devastating fire ripped through the Apollo spacecraft where three astronauts \u2013 Roger Chafee, Ed White II and Virgil \u201cGus\u201d Grissom \u2013 were buckled in and training at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34.\n\nMorale was still low in Brevard County, recalled John Tribe, former chief engineer for Boeing at Kennedy Space Center.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d just lost three of our friends, which should never have happened,\u201d said Tribe, whose career spanned from the Mercury years through the shuttle program.\n\n\u201cBut we kept working.\u201d\n\nIn some ways the tragedy of Apollo 1 galvanized NASA and the space community to fulfill President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1961 challenge to land a man on the moon before the end of the decade. Achieving that goal would not only give America a much-needed boost against the Soviets but also give more Americans an education in the benefits, here on Earth, of space flight.\n\nThe effort to meet Kennedy\u2019s moon call became one of the largest, most complex and expensive engineering endeavors ever, involving 390,000 Americans and $25 billion.\n\nThe first tangible success came 20 months after the Apollo 1 fire when Apollo 7 launched on Oct. 11, 1968, from Cape Kennedy. That first crewed Apollo space mission, carrying NASA astronauts Wally Schirra, Donn Eisele and Walt Cunningham, offered the first live TV broadcast of Americans from space, drawing a worldwide audience.\n\n\u201cApollo 7 was a great success, and that flowed over to us,\u201d Tribe said. \u201cThe program was moving again.\u201d\n\nAnd for those working it, the moon effort required almost full immersion.\n\n1968: Setting the stage for the moon landing Successful testing done in 1968 gave the space program the confidence it needed to send men to the moon in 1969. Florida Today\n\nBy anyone\u2019s count, the work hours leading up to Apollo 8, a mission that launched Dec. 21, 1968, were grueling. Fifty-, 60-plus hour weeks were not unusual, said Charlie Mars, a NASA power and sequential systems engineer when hired in 1965.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t complain. Now, the wives did,\u201d he said \u2013 and the county's divorce rate was high.\n\n\u201cThe wives, the families took the brunt of it. \u2026 And there were times we just didn\u2019t come home. Spend the night. Sleep on a desk. Bring a pillow; sleep somewhere where maybe you could find a couch in a boss\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nMars said he and others were so focused on the mission, they were \u201calmost ignorant to what was going on in the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn a nutshell, we had blinders on. Our blinders were what we did each day in the space program. \u2026 \"Even the servers at the cafeteria were totally caught up in that. Rightfully so.\u201d\n\nJohn Tribe was 32 that year, married, with two children. Getting home in time to help a child with a bath or tuck them into bed was a rarity, he said.\n\nThe Vietnam War? The fight for gender and racial equality and equal pay for equal work? Unrest in the street?\n\n\u201cThose of us working on Apollo didn\u2019t see a lot of it. \u2026 We were very focused, concentrating on our jobs,\u201d said Tribe, whose first marriage crumbled during the pressure of the Apollo years.\n\n\u201cThis was our life, married to the Apollo program. You\u2019d catch the evening news and be like, \u2018Oh my god. What started that?\u2019 and you\u2019d play catch up.\u201d\n\nIt was the same for many young Brevard women who were following the progress of the growing and vocal women\u2019s movement but happy to have a well-paying job in an exciting setting.\n\nJust out of Merritt Island High School, not far from the space center, Hazel Banks took the civil service test for a clerk-stenographer job. She passed and went to work for NASA in December 1965 in a temporary position. Then came an opportunity to work with the manned spacecraft center that handled the Gemini simulation section, where the astronauts trained.\n\n\u201cWe never said: \u2018We quit at 5 o\u2019clock; it\u2019s time for me to go home,\u2019\u201d said Banks, now 70. \u201cWe stayed until we got the job done. And I didn\u2019t have a car at the time and I relied on my co-workers to pick me up and take me back home. .\u201d\n\nBy 1968, Kennedy Space Center\u2019s workforce was at its peak, 26,500 `\u2013 more than double the total four years earlier \u2013 and activity on the Space Coast was a fixture on nightly news.\n\nThe presence of the space workers changed this sleepy beachside county into one of the fastest-growing in the nation with a population ballooning from 111,435 in 1960 to 230,006 a decade later.\n\nCocoa Beach\u2019s population jumped from 3,475 to 9,952 in the \u201960s, with those searching for homes looking for beach, launch views and astronaut sightings.The beach community attracted celebrities and those in the know flocked to spots like the Mouse Trap, Ramon\u2019s and Bernard\u2019s Surf \u2013 the latter was even mentioned on TV's \u201cI Dream of Jeannie,\" set on the Space Coast.\n\nTourists came in droves. Crowds clogged highways for every launch and packed restaurants, bars and stores.\n\n\u201cEverybody was just pumped by the whole atmosphere \u2026 high-school classmates that ended up working at KSC, too,\u201d Banks said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it. We probably still can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nStill, even with the excitement that grew stronger as NASA marched toward a moon landing, racial tension and concern over the plight of the poor were palpable \u2013 sometimes in the shadow of Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThe Rev. W.O. Wells was pastor of Greater St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church in Cocoa in the 1960s. Many of the church\u2019s members worked at the Space Center but Wells still helped put plans in motion for a 1969 anti-poverty march to Gate 3 of the Space Center complex.\n\nThe Rev. Oliver Wells, a Cocoa native, was 12 when his father marched on the Space Center.\n\n\"The anti-poverty march was huge, because they were making the statement that if we could spend money to send man to the moon, we can spend money to eradicate poverty here in this county,\u201d Wells said.\n\n\u201cHe was very concerned about it. You can imagine \u2026 here you had a major employer in the area, with many members of St. Paul, where my father was senior pastor, working over there at the Space Center. But it was important for my father to be part of that particular march, instigated by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Because what they were saying was, \u2018We\u2019re going to the moon when people on Earth are hungry.\u2019 You had that dichotomy of people struggling on Earth while we were invested in all that research that would get us to the moon.\u201d\n\nRetired United Launch Alliance employee Theodis Ray was born and raised just miles from Kennedy Space Center.\n\nRay, a black man, had signed on as a janitor at the Space Center in 1964 but left to join the U.S. Marines in 1965. He had hoped to be a state trooper after his service. But he was told his color would preclude that: This, don\u2019t forget, was in an area where civil rights icons Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore had been slain in 1951 and the last segregated schools didn\u2019t close until 1968.\n\nSo, back home in 1968, Ray headed back across the Indian River. The Space Center was a place where a person lucky enough to get hired, he said, could make a good living and be part of something bigger.\n\n\u201cThat was one area that paid a decent salary, with benefits for retirement,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the jobs were in janitorial or construction, but out there, if you had the qualifications; if you knew somebody or were military \u2026 you had a chance.\u201d\n\nRay recalled showing up to look for a job in a spot where the launch pads were visible across the river. From a listing of jobs available for a veteran with his qualifications, he chose warehousing. At retirement in 2000, he was logistics lead for United Launch Alliance.\n\n\u201cI raised a family, had a home,\u201d he said. \u201cBy it being a union job, I got the benefit of working and learning as I went, with everything going by seniority. If you got on out there, you had a chance \u2026 and I got that.\u201d\n\nThose who today consider themselves lucky enough to have been part of the moon challenge say it changed their lives \u2013 just as their work changed the way humans saw their planet and themselves.\n\nThat fall and winter of 1968, that message of hope and possibility reverberated around the globe.\n\nThe Apollo 8 mission, with astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders, was defining in that it proved that landing on the moon was within reach. The six-day, three-hour and 42-second mission saw astronauts orbit the moon 10 times. For the first time, astronauts viewed the dark side of the moon.\n\nJust over six months later, Neil Armstrong stepped out of the Eagle and made his \u201cone giant leap for mankind.\u201d\n\nApollo 8, like the other Apollo missions and the Gemini and Mercury before that, helped get America there.\n\nBut Apollo 8 also gave all humans, not just Americans, a new view of Planet Earth \u2013 and perhaps, our shared humanity, in the waning days of a year torn by man-made tensions.\n\nThe iconic Earthrise photo, taken by astronaut Bill Anders, showed the \"blue marble\" in the distance, with the moon's surface in the foreground. Stark and stunning, it gave humanity a look at their fragile planet as seen from space.\n\nIt's still a significant photograph, said Banks, who stayed with NASA through Apollo 15.\n\n\u201cEarthrise \u2026 that was like going back to Michelangelo or something,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSpeechless, priceless, breathless \u2026 (like) we really are part of a universe that\u2019s much different to us and maybe this will help us realize it, too.\n\nAdding to that feeling was the decision by the Apollo 8 crew to read the first 10 verses of Genesis on Christmas Eve as they orbited the moon. In 2008, astronaut Frank Borman recalled: \"We were told that on Christmas Eve we would have the largest audience that had ever listened to a human voice. And the only instructions that we got from NASA was to do something appropriate.\"\n\nFor those listening not only in the United States but around the globe, it was so much more, said Banks.\n\n\u201cWhen they started reading from Genesis it was like \u2026 it really was the best Christmas present ever,\u201d she said.\n\nContact Kennerly at 321-242-3692 or bkennerly@floridatoday.com.

No matter if you\u2019re shopping for a sibling, a longtime spouse, or a co-worker, the act of picking out the perfect gift can be overwhelming. What does she want? What doesn\u2019t she already own? What color would she want it in? Is she allergic to anything? Does she like to read? What is her favorite scent?

For the home chef: Staub Dutch Oven\n\nBest gifts for women 2018: Staub Dutch Oven (Photo: Staub)\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of, seen, or owned a Le Creuset dutch oven. They are one of the most popular wedding gifts for newlyweds and, like KitchenAid stand mixers, a kitchen staple for adults everywhere. When I was shopping for my wedding registry earlier this year, an employee at Williams-Sonoma encouraged us not to register for a Le Creuset, but instead a Staub dutch oven. I became curious and started noticing my favorite food bloggers posting meals in Staub cookware on Instagram\u2014and I recognized that my favorite fast casual food place, Cava, used them to display food. THEN, we tested dutch ovens at Reviewed and our favorite overall was the Staub! Clearly these dutch ovens are hot right now, so get them for the person in your life who loves cooking. You can\u2019t go wrong.\n\nGet the Staub Cast Iron 5.5 Quart Round Cocotte on Amazon for $324.95\n\n2.

No itching from discomfort. These yogas are definitely worth the price tag. I promise. If you're looking for an option that is a little less money, Nordstrom's fitness brand, Zella, has a pair of high waist leggings that have 4.5 stars from 5,400 reviews. I own them, and they are great too.\n\nGet the Lululemon Wunder Under Hi-Rise Yoga Pants from Lululemon for $98\n\n3.

The Dakota slipper has been around for years, combining fashion and comfort into one. You can even wear the shoe outside, as it has a rubber sole. Speaking from experience, you can\u2019t go wrong with UGG slippers as a gift. In the past six years, I have given a different pair of UGG slippers to my mom, grandmother, grandfather, fianc\u00e9, and brothers \u2013 and each time, they were a hit.\n\nGet the Ugg Dakota Slippers from Nordstrom for $99.95\n\n4.

They make great gifts\u2014especially when they\u2019re this cozy(chic). Not shopping for a cardigan person? Barefoot Dreams also sells a robe. Just saying...\n\nGet the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Cardigan from Nordstrom for $116\n\n6. For the music lover: Sonos One Smart Speaker\n\nBest gifts for women 2018: Sonos One (Photo: Sonos)\n\nThe all-new voice controlled smart speaker by Sonos is one of our favorite gift ideas for 2018. With Alexa built it, you can not only play music, but also check news and traffic and control other smart devices.

The brand is also one of our favorites here at Reviewed. When we tested checked luggage, Away won as our best hard-sided suitcase. It comes in 14 different colors and looks much different than your average carry-on. My personal favorite is the blush color. If you don\u2019t want to splurge on a suitcase as a gift for the traveler, consider a duffle bag instead.

They\u2019re comfortable, they\u2019re slimming, they never rip, and they\u2019re a great price. And they have curvy jeans now, which honestly were the best gift I ever received when I bought those bad boys for myself.

However, if the person you\u2019re shopping for is simple and timeless, this Kate Spade pendant necklace could be perfect.

Crew Chateau Parka\n\nBest gifts for her 2018: J. Crew Parka (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nThree years ago, I bought the J. Crew Chateau Parka in royal blue. It was a bit of a splurge, but I wanted a coat I could dress up or down and wear in not-as-cold weather in addition to my huge, puffy winter parka. Since buying it, I've worn it hundreds of times. Even this month alone, I've worn it a bunch. The coat is still in perfect condition, and its timeless look is still very much in fashion. The pockets are not only stylish, but useable\u2014and the zippers give it a city chic look and feel. The fur comes off the hood, too! This jacket is one of my favorite things, and I think it would make a great gift for any woman into fashion who lives in a place where you sometimes need a coat. It comes in multiple colors, but red, black, and green are my favorites this year.\n\nA pro tip: If this coat goes on sale at J. Crew, contact Nordstrom and they will price match it.

For the one who is always smiling: Sugarfina Champagne Bears Cube\n\nBest gifts for women 2018: Sugarfina Champagne Bears (Photo: Sugarfina)\n\nSugarfina candies are not like regular candies. They are cool candies. But really. With flavors such as bourbon, ros\u00e9, and CHAMPAGNE, it doesn't get much more fancy than this. This past year, I gave my bridesmaids the champagne cubes as a gift and everyone loved them (including me). These are an adorable, inexpensive gift.\n\nGet the Sugarfina Champagne Bears Large Candy Cube from Nordstrom for $20\n\n24. For the picky one: Gift Cards\n\nBest gifts for women 2018: Gift Cards (Photo: Amazon)\n\nShopping for some people can be hard. I get it. I am that person who is hard to shop for. I expect people to read my mind and know what I want without me having to tell them. Being this type of person, I can tell you first hand that GIFT CARDS are the way to go. I love a good gift card. Spending money is my favorite hobby, and if you know someone like me, I guarantee you they will love the gift of spending someone else's money.

Ten years ago or so, my grandmother bought me this gift set for the holidays and it honestly changed my life. I knew nothing about perfume, but I was able to dabble in a few best-sellers thanks to this kit. When I was done, I picked my favorite (Marc Jacobs Daisy) and redeemed the coupon in the gift set for a full-sized bottle of it. I still use Daisy today. This might be at the bottom of the list, and I might be recommending it for the random person in your life, but this is a life-changing gift and it\u2019s actually great for anyone and everyone.\n\nGet the Sephora Favorites Holiday Perfume Sample from Sephora for $65 ($122 value)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2017/11/13/25-amazing-gifts-women-actually-want/107666244/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Josh Hafner, USA TODAY", "title": "Batkid saved San Francisco five years ago, and his cancer's been in remission ever since", "description": "Batkid's cancer in remission since saving San Fran", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/15/batkids-cancer-remission-after-make-wish-helped-him-save-city/2011569002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.kgw.com/assets/GANNETT/images/1709dce4-4d02-45fe-9b4d-ec91846a0985/1709dce4-4d02-45fe-9b4d-ec91846a0985_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:58:32Z", "content": "Five years after he saved San Francisco from villainy, received cheers from a crowd of 20,000 and kudos from the president, Miles Scott \u2014 the Make-A-Wish recipient who, for a day, became Batkid \u2014 lives today in remission from leukemia.

Then-President Barack Obama and astronauts from the International Space Station sent the tiny caped crusader encouragement, too.\n\n\"Batkid Saves City,\" declared a special edition of the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nA flood of interest, donations and volunteer offers followed the wish, shutting down the foundation's website. While the average wish costs $10,000, the foundation said, donors stepped in to cover all costs to the city.\n\nThe wish five years ago marked the end of Miles' treatment, and today he sees an oncologist yearly. Most cancers that return do so within the first five years after treatment, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nToday, Miles enjoys science and robotics and plays baseball, the foundation said. He helps on his family's farm and sold his first goat at a local fair. His mom, Natalie, contacted Make-A-Wish about volunteering to help grant wishes for other children in need.\n\nTo learn more about Miles' story, check out the film produced from that day, \"Batkid Begins.\"\n\nCLOSE See how an entire city came together to transform 5-year-old cancer patient Miles Scott into \"the real Batman\" for a day.

(Photo: Elizabeth Robertson, AP)\n\nMOUNT HOLLY, N.J. \u2013 It was a feel-good story that was too good to be true, authorities say.\n\nProsecutors on Thursday announced they filed criminal charges against a Burlington County couple and a homeless veteran at the center of an online crowdfunding campaign that captured thousands of people's hearts through lies and deception.\n\nThe Burlington County (New Jersey) Prosecutor's Office has charged Katelyn McClure and Mark D'Amico, both of Florence, New Jersey, with theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft in connection with the viral story of a homeless Samaritan's supposed act of kindness.\n\nThe man described by the couple as a good Samaritan, 35-year-old Johnny Bobbitt Jr., was charged with the same crimes.\n\nOfficials say the trio concocted a fictitious story meant to tug at peoples' heartstrings and prompt them to donate to a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nBobbitt came into the spotlight last November after the couple started sharing a story of the man coming to McClure's rescue.\n\nMcClure had reportedly run out of gas on an Interstate 295 exit ramp in Philadelphia. Bobbitt, a homeless U.S. Marine, used his last $20 to buy fuel for the woman and get her back on the road, they claimed.\n\nMcClure and her boyfriend, D'Amico, then returned to give Bobbitt gifts and money as a thank you and set up a crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe.\n\nSept. 14: New Jersey AG questions online fundraising after homeless man's GoFundMe story\n\nSept. 7: GoFundMe says man will get his $400K as investigators search couple's home in case\n\nThe goal was to raise $10,000 for Bobbitt to help get his life turned around by providing enough money for him to secure an apartment, car and some living expenses, they said.\n\nBut Bobbitt's story went viral, and 14,347 donors contributed a total of $402,706 to the cause over a 32-day period as it captured international media attention.\n\n\"The entire campaign was predicated on a lie,\" Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said Thursday.\n\nMcClure texted her best friend an hour after the GoFundMe campaign went live to say the story was \"completely made up,\" according to evidence revealed in court papers Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe entire campaign was predicated on a lie.\u201d Scott Coffina, Burlington County, New Jersey, prosecutor\n\nOfficials said Bobbitt and McClure didn't have a chance meeting caused by her car running out of gas. Instead, Bobbitt met the couple \"at least a month prior to the date of the GoFundMe campaign's launch,\" Coffina said, \"as they had become acquainted with him during their frequent trips to a local gambling casino.\"\n\nA timeline of the case, provided by the prosecutor's office, says McClure and D'Amico discussed in text messages on Oct. 16, 2017, \"the homeless guy they see by\" SugarHouse Casino.\n\nCoffina said Bobbitt was a willing participant in the conspiracy to defraud kindhearted people who'd want to help.\n\n\u201cLet me say this about Johnny Bobbitt: He deserves our appreciation for his willingness to serve our country in the U.S. Marines ... but it is imperative to keep in mind he was fully compliant\" in the scheme, the prosecutor said.\n\nCoffina said his office examined more than 60,000 text messages and thousands of pages of financial documents that it subpoenaed to piece together what happened to the donations.\n\n\u201cHe has our sympathy and concern for the homeless he experienced ... We feel for him. I hope Johnny finds a way to get himself well.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Amico and McClure used the money to buy a BMW and \u201chigh-end\u201d handbags, take multiple vacations including a New Year\u2019s trip to Las Vegas and a Grand Canyon helicopter tour, and pay off personal debts to family members, the prosecutor said. More than $85,000 was withdrawn near casinos in Atlantic City, Las Vegas and Bensalem, Pennsylvania, authorities said.\n\nSept. 6: Court orders deposition for couple who raised $400K for homeless man\n\nSept. 4: $400K raised for homeless man on GoFundMe is gone, attorney says\n\nJust a few months after the GoFundMe was launched, all of the money had been spent, Coffina said.\n\nIn a March 2018 text exchange, the prosecutor noted, McClure \u201clamented\u201d that the couple had less than $10,000 left.\n\n\u201cBut D\u2019Amico wasn\u2019t worried,\u201d the prosecutor said, noting he was certain the \u201cpayday from the book deal they were pursuing would dwarf the money generated by the GoFundMe campaign.\u201d\n\nIn this Aug. 27, 2018, photo released by NBC, Mark D'Amico, left, and Kate McClure speak with host Megyn Kelly on \"Megyn Kelly Today,\" in New York. D'Amico and McClure, who set up a GoFundMe page for homeless man Johnny Bobbitt, are accused in a lawsuit brought by Bobbitt of mismanaging donations. (Photo: Nathan Congleton, AP)\n\nBy the end of March, authorities said, every last penny of the $367,108.81 distributed to McClure and D'Amico by GoFundMe was gone.\n\nThe relationship among the trio soured in August when an attorney representing Bobbitt filed a civil suit claiming McClure and D'Amico hadn't given him nearly $200,000 of the donation fund.\n\nThe couple was ordered to turn over to their attorney all remaining money and provide an accounting of the money spent and what was left.\n\nThat didn't happen, though, and the judge considered \u2013 but ultimately decided against \u2013 charging McClure and D'Amico with contempt of court.\n\nCoffina said he had no idea why Bobbitt would file a lawsuit against the couple knowing that the GoFundMe campaign was a lie.\n\n\u201cFiling a lawsuit was a miscalculation on his part,\" Coffina said.\n\nEven after the dispute became public, D\u2019Amico still had confidence another windfall would come to him, Coffina said. The prosecutor said D\u2019Amico pitched a title for a book that would address the controversy: \u201cNo Good Deed.\u201d\n\nAug. 31: Judge orders couple to give money from GoFundMe campaign to homeless man\n\nAug. 25: Homeless again, man fears he'll never get most of the $400k from a GoFundMe in his honor\n\nBut by September, it became clear that law enforcement was looking into what happened to the money. The prosecutor's office on Sept. 6 executed a search warrant at the couple's Cedar Lane Extension home as part of a criminal investigation, seizing a vehicle, jewelry and other items, according to court papers. During the search, authorities found 12 newly purchased designer handbags among other luxury items, court documents said.\n\nThat evidence and related investigation allowed authorities to confirm the stranded-motorist story \"was a complete fabrication\" and the GoFundMe campaign was a \"calculated and orchestrated attempt\" by D'Amico, McClure and Bobbitt to deceive donors, authorities said in court papers.\n\nD'Amico and McClure surrendered to authorities Wednesday night and were released after being processed. Bobbitt, who lives in Philadelphia's Kensington section, was arrested in the city Wednesday by members of two U.S. Marshals task forces; he remains in jail pending an extradition hearing.\n\nEach of the charges can result in a prison sentence of five to 10 years, if convicted.\n\nThis photo taken Aug. 15, 2018, shows Johnny Bobbitt Jr. Kate McClure and Mark D'Amico said they raised more than $400,000 for Bobbitt after he used his last $20 to fill up McClure's gas tank in Philadelphia. (Photo: David Swanson, AP)\n\nAll of the donations will be refunded, GoFundMe said Thursday.\n\n\"While this type of behavior by an individual is extremely rare, it's unacceptable and clearly it has consequences. Committing fraud, whether it takes place on or offline is against the law,\" said spokesman Bobby Whithorne.\n\nWhithorne said refunds will be processed \"in the coming days.\"\n\n\u201cA case like this can make generous people skeptical,\" Coffina said. \"People should use common sense when donating.\"\n\nNovember 2017: Homeless vet gave last $20 to help a stranded driver.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Alabama's offense can still try to play the neighborhood bully at times, just not quite so effectively as in recent seasons.\n\nTua Tagovailoa and the top-ranked Crimson Tide's offense were not as high-flying as they had been when they ran up against two of the Southeastern Conference's top defenses. But 'Bama has proven it can still overpower with force even if the running game hasn't been nearly as dominant this season.\n\nThe Crimson Tide, which hosts The Citadel on Saturday, turned to the running game early and late against No. 25 Mississippi State to build and hold onto a lead.\n\n\"At the end of that game and at the end of the LSU game and a couple others this year, it's one of the things we've gotten better at, being able to run the ball when they know you're running it,\" Alabama left tackle Jonah Williams said. \"So I think being able to do that, we end the game with it in our control.\"\n\nIt used to be a foregone conclusion that defenses would load up against 'Bama's ground game.\n\nThere's no doubt Alabama's offense is more diverse this season, but the tailbacks have heard the criticism about a running game that's been the offensive staple under coach Nick Saban.\n\nThe Tide hasn't really run the ball much less than last season. The yards just aren't coming in quite such big chunks.\n\nEven without a dangerous runner like Jalen Hurts at quarterback, Alabama has only run 37 fewer times than through the first 10 games last season. But the Tide produced 33 touchdowns and averaged 6.0 yards per carry during that span a year ago, compared to 25 touchdowns and 5.2 ypc in 2018.\n\nAlabama still has a typically talented backfield : The veteran Damien Harris, the versatile Josh Jacobs and the defender hurdling highlight-reel runner Najee Harris.\n\nOnly Jacobs was anything less than a five-star recruit.\n\nBut Alabama opened against Mississippi State with two run-heavy touchdown drives, totaling 16 rushes and just six passes. The Tide closed with 10 straight runs, the first six from Jacobs and the last four from Damien Harris.\n\nLike Williams, Jacobs relishes those kind of drives.\n\n\"You know that we're going to run the ball and you know they're going to try to stop the run, so they're going to overload the box,\" Jacobs said. \"And it's just manpower. Me versus you. That's what we try to do, be more physical.\"\n\nDamien Harris is trying to become the first Alabama player to rush for 1,000 yards in three seasons, but ranks 14th in the Southeastern Conference with a modest 595 yards. Najee Harris has run for 588 and Jacobs has 381 yards and nine touchdowns while also returning kicks.\n\nJacobs insists he doesn't mind that much of the attention has gone to Tagovailoa and the receivers.\n\n\"When our name is called, we execute,\" he said. \"Maybe we haven't had as many opportunities but now we take advantage of those opportunities.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Paul newberry) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Baseball owners have locked down their commissioner and their main broadcast partner, too.\n\nAny decisions on speeding up the game and perhaps making it more enjoyable to watch will have to wait.\n\nAfter wrapping up two days of meetings at a hotel next to the Atlanta Braves' SunTrust Park, the owners announced a new contract for Commissioner Rob Manfred, keeping him on the job at least through the 2024 regular season. The 60-year-old started a five-year term in January 2015.\n\n\"It seems like about 15 minutes ago I was spending a really dreadful day in a not-very-nice hotel suite in Baltimore waiting to see if I could get vote number \u2014 what was I looking for, 23 right?\" quipped Manfred, who won the vote to succeed Bud Selig in August 2014 after beating out two other contenders. \"It seems almost impossible that four years have gone by.\"\n\nThe owners also signed off on a new television deal with Fox, which still has three seasons to go on its current eight-year contract that pays baseball an average of $525 million per season.\n\nThe seven-year extension, which runs through 2028, will be worth just over $5 billion to MLB \u2014 roughly a 36 percent increase to an average of about $715 million per season.\n\nManfred was asked whether the owners had any reservations to making such a long-term commitment, especially giving the rapidly changing dynamics of the broadcast and online industries.\n\n\"I'm a huge believer in the idea that when you have a good partner, even when you're looking at an uncertain landscape, that good partners find a way to navigate that uncertain landscape,\" the commissioner said.\n\nThe relationship with Fox, which began in 1996, will continue to include the World Series and All-Star Game, as well as extensive playoff coverage on both the network and its all-sports cable channel, FS1.\n\nThe new agreement also commits Fox to showing more games from the League Championship Series on its main network, beginning in 2019. It was criticized for televising all but Game 2 in this year's seven-game NLCS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Milwaukee Brewers on FS1, which has a narrower distribution. Starting next year, two of the first four games and Game 7 will be on Fox.\n\nIn addition to the extension with Fox, MLB also approved a $300 million, three-year with DAZN, a subscription video streaming service run by former ESPN president John Skipper. Manfred called it a key part of baseball's strategy to reach a new generation of fans.\n\nDAZN will co-produce a nightly highlight show at the MLB Network in Secaucus, New Jersey, and do live cut-ins to games Monday through Friday, an arrangement that steers clear of national broadcast slots held by Fox and ESPN on the weekend.\n\n\"The owners have shown courage, because we are new,\" Skipper said. \"We will make sure that young fans have a whip-around show (similar to NFL's Red Zone) that shows every home run, every highlight. We will get them interested in the game.\"\n\nWhile the deals with Manfred, Fox and DAZN were expected , baseball has yet to come to a consensus on the best ways to improve a sport that suffered a 4 percent dip in attendance this season to 69.6 million, plunging to its lowest level since 2003.\n\nManfred and the owners continue to look at ways to speed play . Nine-inning games averaged 3 hours, 4 minutes in 2018. While that was 4 minutes lower than the previous season, it still matched the third-highest average in baseball history.\n\nBaseball's style of play is also under scrutiny as teams have increasingly become reliant on a home run-or-bust offensive strategy to beat defensive shifts and reliever-heavy pitching staffs that are able to mix and match for almost any situation.\n\nTampa Bay , most notably, even began using relievers to start games, only expecting to get an inning or two out of them before beginning a series of changes. While baseball set a record for homers in 2017 and stayed close to a record level this year, it also had more strikeouts than hits for the first time in 2018 as the cumulative batting average dipped to .248 \u2014 the lowest since 1972, the year before the designated hitter was introduced in the American League.\n\nChris Marinak, MLB's executive vice president for strategy, technology and innovation, provided owners with a report on those issues. Manfred refused to go into details, saying he preferred to reach a consensus with the players' union. That includes any decision on a pitch clock, which the owners have the right to impose without union approval under the labor agreement.\n\nManfred and Tony Clark, head of the MLB Players Association, have been exchanging dates to discuss possible improvements, though the commissioner stressed that no major changes are expected.\n\n\"The owners are realistic about how the business performed,\" Manfred said. \"The focus of the conversation, however, was to make sure we do everything we can to get as many fans in the ballpark in 2019 as we possibly can. We do think we have some good ideas we'll be rolling out in the next few months.\"\n\nYankees owner Hal Steinbrenner stressed that baseball merely needs some minor tweaking, not a massive overhaul.\n\n\"There are reasons the game had changed,\" Steinbrenner said. \"I don't see those changes reverting because, quite frankly, I think those are good changes. There's only so much we're going to be able to do. But we have to continue to try to do everything we can. It's not something we can ignore.\"\n\nManfred said MLB is expected to announce a host for the 2021 All-Star Game sometimes early next year. He acknowledged that SunTrust Park is one of the contenders.\n\nThe owners got a tour of the 2-year-old stadium, notable for the adjacent mixed-use development that is also controlled by the Braves. It includes restaurants, bars, retail shops, apartments, an office tower as well as the hotel where the meetings were held.\n\nAtlanta has hosted two previous All-Star Games, most recently in 2000 at its previous home, Turner Field.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

(AP Photo/Joel Auerbach, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 The Miami Dolphins arrived at their bye week a .500 team, which is no surprise because for the past quarter century they've been a .500 franchise.\n\nTheir record since 1994: 197-197. Their record this year: 5-5. Coach Adam Gase's three-year record: 21-21.\n\nIf there's a middle of the pack, the Dolphins are in the middle of it. They haven't won a playoff game since 2000, but they could well be headed for their third 8-8 finish in the past six years.\n\n\"These are tough times to be a Dolphin fan,\" tweeted their former fullback, Pro Football Hall of Famer Larry Csonka. \"Very frustrating. Shabby football.\"\n\nFar from perfect, for sure. Given the way the season has gone, it's amazing the Dolphins can still talk with a straight face about making the playoffs.\n\nThey've been decimated by injuries, including the loss of quarterback Ryan Tannehill for the past five games. They've been outgained by 787 yards, third-worst in the league, and outscored by 57 points. They rank 28th in offense and 26th in defense.\n\nYet they began the week with the eighth-best record in the AFC, while eight teams had worse records.\n\nIn sum: more Miami mediocrity.\n\n\"We are in a good position,\" running back Frank Gore said with a straight face. \"We just need to stay as one, believe in each other, believe in our coaching staff and try to get the next one.\"\n\nThe next one will be Nov. 25 at Indianapolis, with Tannehill hoping to return from his throwing shoulder injury, although that may be a long shot.\n\nOnly two of the six remaining games are against teams with winning records. So it's not impossible for Miami to actually make the playoffs for only the third time in the past 17 seasons.\n\n\"There are certain teams that have kind of separated themselves from the rest of the pack,\" Gase said. \"But right now, the only thing that's really been eliminated for us is an undefeated season. Everything else is on the table. Other teams are having a lot of the same issues we are, and it's really who can pull it together these last six games and find a way to get in.\"\n\nA bye week may not be enough time to resolve the Dolphins' many issues, however. That could take an offseason or three.\n\nFor starters, the Dolphins are on pace to allow the most yards in franchise history. Their run defense ranks last in the league and seems to be getting worse, with 174 yards allowed per game and 5.9 per carry over the past five weeks. Defensive dysfunction is such that two-time Pro Bowl safety Reshad Jones took himself out of a game because he was unhappy with a plan to rotate personnel.\n\nAnd then there's the offense, which has gone nine quarters without a touchdown. In the past three games receiver Danny Amendola has thrown for more scores (one) than quarterback Brock Osweiler (none).\n\n\"This football team deserves touchdowns,\" Osweiler said.\n\nOsweiler has been critical of his play as Tannehill's replacement, and he's not alone. But bad luck has been an offensive culprit, too. The Dolphins lost their most dynamic player, receiver Albert Wilson, and two starting offensive linemen to season-ending injuries, and three other injured linemen sat out last week's loss at Green Bay.\n\nBad health is less of an excuse on defense, where Gase's decision to jettison tackles Ndamukong Suh and Jordan Phillips left holes that haven't been filled. Yawning run gaps and blown coverage are staples, calling into question the future of second-year coordinator Matt Burke.\n\nThat's a topic for the offseason, along with the future of Tannehill. First the Dolphins will try to summon a late-season surge, which would be something new.\n\nOver the past decade, their record in December is 22-22.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Clark was 85. (Photo: The Lansing State Journal)\n\nCountry Music Hall of Fame member and versatile entertainer Roy Clark died Thursday at his home in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after complications from pneumonia, his publicist said. He was 85.\n\nA fleet-fingered instrumentalist best known for his 24 years as a \"Hee Haw\" co-host, the affable Clark was one of country music's most beloved ambassadors.\n\nHe brought heart and humor to audiences around the world, guest-hosted \"The Tonight Show,\" worked with greats like Hank Williams and blues artist Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown and inspired countless pickers, including a young Brad Paisley, with his instructional guitar books.\n\nMore country music: CMA Awards 2018: Stars salute bluegrass artist Ricky Skaggs\n\nMore country music: Garth Brooks' emotional new song to Trisha Yearwood at CMAs: 'I pray God takes me first'\n\n\"He's honest,\" said fellow Country Music Hall of Famer Harold Bradley when Clark was inducted in 2009. \"Whether he's playing guitar or singing, he's honest. Whatever he does, he sparkles.\"\n\nRoy Linwood Clark was born April 15, 1933, in Meherrin, Virginia. The oldest of five children, he grew up in a musical family.\n\nHe learned how to play banjo at a early age, but it was the guitar that spoke to him. \"When I strummed the strings for the first time, something clicked inside me,\" he told The Tennessean in 1987.\n\nWithin weeks of learning his first chords, the teenage Clark was playing behind his father at area square dances. Not long after that, he was performing on local radio and television.\n\nMore: Keith Urban, Brad Paisley, more stars mourn 'hero,' 'Hee Haw' host Roy Clark\n\nCLOSE Roy Clark has died at 85 years old. He was known for being a co-host on \"Hee Haw\" and was a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. Ayrika L Whitney, The Tennessean\n\n\"The camera was very kind to me, and I consider myself to be a television baby,\" Clark said in 2009. \"At first, it wasn't that I was so talented, but they had to fill time ... so they'd say, 'Well, let's get the kid.' Later, I got to where when I looked at the camera, I didn't see a mechanical device. I saw a person.\"\n\nWhile still in his teens, he won banjo-playing championships, and, in 1949, he worked briefly on a show fronted by Hank Williams.\n\nClark's deft musicianship caught the ear of Jimmy Dean, who performed on television and radio in the Washington, D.C., area. Dean hired the young musician, then fired him because of his repeated tardiness. \"He said, 'Clark, you're gonna be a big star someday, but right now I can't afford to have someone like you around,\" Clark remembered in a 1988 Tennessean article.\n\nDean's prediction came true, eventually.\n\nIn his early days in Nashville, Clark and banjo player David \"Stringbean\" Akeman worked any stage they could find. \"We would play drive-in theaters, standing on top of the projection booth,\" Clark told The Tennessean in 2009. \"If the people liked it, they'd honk their horns.\"\n\nLas Vegas to Leningrad\n\nIn 1960, Clark joined rockabilly/country artist Wanda Jackson's band, playing guitar and opening her shows at the Golden Nugget Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nJackson was on Capitol Records, and after Ken Nelson, the label's A&R man, heard Clark at one of her concerts, he signed him.\n\nAs a solo artist, Clark's breakout hit in 1963 came when his version of Bill Anderson's \"Tips of My Fingers\" hit No. 10 on the country charts, and he found crossover success with the 1969 smash \"Yesterday, When I Was Young.\" (In 1995, he performed that song at Mickey Mantle's funeral.)\n\nClark's role as Buck Owens' overall-clad comedic foil on \"Hee Haw,\" combined with hits like \"Thank God and Greyhound\" and \"Come Live with Me\" endeared him to country audiences in the '70s. In 1973, he won the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award; later in the decade he won a slew of CMA Instrumentalist of the Year Awards, both as a solo musician and with Buck Trent.\n\nAs an entertainer, Clark forged his own trail. He became one of the first country stars to tour the Soviet Union when he embarked on an 18-date excursion with the Oak Ridge Boys. Twelve years later, he returned to the U.S.S.R. for a \"friendship tour.\"\n\nHe was also first country star to open a theater in Branson, Missouri. The Roy Clark Celebrity Theater opened in 1983 \u2013 the same year he won the Grammy Award for best country instrumentalist performance for his recording of \"Alabama Jubilee\" \u2013 and several other artists followed him to the tourist-friendly town.\n\nIn 1987, Clark became a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2009 alongside Barbara Mandrell and Charlie McCoy.\n\nWhen the Country Music Association celebrated the 50th annual CMA Awards in 2016, Clark, seated with a five-string banjo on his lap, and Paisley helped kick off the show. They played Buck Owens' \"Tiger By the Tail,\" but it was their re-enactment of Owens and Clark's most famous \"Hee Haw\" lines that brought the loudest cheers: \"I'm a-pickin' ...\"\n\n\"... and I'm a-grinnin'.\"\n\nAfter the awards, Paisley wrote on Twitter, \"I will never, ever get over this moment.\"\n\nClark is preceded in death by grandson Elijah Clark. He is survived by Barbara, his wife of 61 years, his sons Roy Clark II and wife Karen, Dr. Michael Meyer and wife Robin, Terry Lee Meyer, Susan Mosier and Diane Stewart, and his grandchildren: Scott Fearington, Brittany Meyer, Michael Meyer, Caleb Clark, Josiah Clark and his sister, Susan Coryell.\n\nA memorial celebration will be held in the coming days in Tulsa.

(Photo: Wilfredo Lee, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A Miami pedestrian bridge that collapsed in March and killed six people had design errors, federal investigators said Thursday.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board will continue to investigate the collapse of the 174-foot-long section of the Florida International University bridge that was under construction. The board hasn't ruled on what caused the collapse, and the results could take months.\n\nThe errors in the design of the northern edge of the bridge overestimated how much stress the structure could take, according to the two-page board update. Cracking observed in the bridge before the collapse was consistent with the design errors, according to the board, which received help in analyzing the incident from the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Office of Bridges and Structures.\n\nBesides the six fatalities, eight people were injured in the collapse March 15. Eight vehicles were crushed beneath the bridge that had been under construction above Southwest Eighth Street, and seven were occupied.\n\nThe FHA\u2019s Turner-Fairbanks Highway Research Center conducted numerous tests and examinations of concrete and steel samples taken from the bridge.\n\nDespite the collapse, the tests found that concrete samples from the bridge deck and canopy met requirements and that the concrete met Florida Department of Transportation specifications.\n\nThe $14.2 million bridge was being built under a process that allowed for installation of large sections, but one that experts said left it vulnerable to collapse until it was completed.\n\nThe structure above a seven-lane road was intended to link the university's new dorms with off-campus housing. When completed, the structure would have been 289 feet long and 109 feet tall.\n\nWhen the 950-ton bridge collapsed, a witness said it sounded \"like the world was ending.\" Rescuers clawed through the rubble to help survivors.\n\nOne part of the bridge came down on the driver's side of a car, killing the female driver but not the passenger, a witness said.

And when a driver\u2019s position can go from the front of the field to the middle or back of a 40-car race while stopped on pit road \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 every tenth of a second counts.\n\nA fast pit crew is just as important as a talented driver; NASCAR is by no means an individual sport, though it is often talked about that way. Teams look for ways to tweak their stock cars to gain fractions of a second and do the same with their pit crews \u2014 turning from hiring mechanics who might be athletic to recruiting athletes and teaching them how to change a tire.\n\n\u201cRaw athleticism\u201d is the intangible teams seek out, and they provide their athletes with as many tools as they can financially afford to help them stay in shape and protect their bodies throughout the grueling schedule with almost no offseason, said Daniel Knost, Stewart-Haas Racing\u2019s athletic director.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to pass on the race track, so a lot of times, it\u2019s much easier to pass in the pits,\u201d explained Knost, who\u2019s also the team\u2019s director of vehicle dynamics.\n\n\u201cThe car can come in and you may be able to take three or four positions in a matter of seconds on pit road that would take you many, many laps, if you could do it at all, on track.\u201d\n\nParticularly for the larger NASCAR teams \u2014 like SHR, Hendrick Motorsports, Joe Gibbs Racing and Team Penske \u2014 an elite and wide-ranging training staff is at their pit crews\u2019 disposal. They work with position coaches, strength and conditioning trainers, physical therapists, nutritionists and even sports psychologists. They have full training facilities with gyms, recovery areas and sports medicine departments.\n\nMimicking the conditions of pit road is part of these teams\u2019 daily routines. For example, Team Penske has a 425,000 square foot indoor facility to practice pit stops, and Joe Gibbs Racing has a couple practice cars and a wall they jump off just like at the track. In many ways, the teams function like any other professional sports organization.\n\nSmaller teams like Wood Brothers Racing and Furniture Row Racing form alliances with larger organizations to have access to their ample resources, which can include using pit crew members from those outfits.\n\n\u201cWe practice, we work out, we watch film, we have a turf field that we do running and sprinting drills on,\u201d explained Matthew Tyrrell, the fueler for Kyle Busch and the No. 18 Toyota team who was a center and long snapper at Carson Newman, a Division II school in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cWe do strength training, we do speed training, we do practice the pit stops and have a film review from our practice stops and our race film to see where we can get better and make improvements.\u201d\n\nBut along with the adjustment of learning a new sport comes the challenge of redesigning workouts and, particularly for the former offensive linemen, even losing a little weight. They\u2019re working the same muscle groups as football with a focus on back and upper body for fuelers, jackmen and tire carriers and legs for tire changers. Core work for everyone is a must too.\n\nLandon Walker, the fueler for William Byron\u2019s No. 24 Chevrolet, was an offensive tackle at Clemson from 2008 to 2011. When he was first recruited by Hendrick Motorsports in 2012, he said he was \u201ctrying to bench press the house\u201d because that\u2019s what he was used to. But the 29-year quickly learned he doesn\u2019t need to consistently bench 300 pounds anymore. The focus now is more reps with less weight, which he said is especially helpful as he gets older.\n\nThey still bench press and do squats and clean jerks, but Rowdy Harrell \u2014 a tire carrier for Alex Bowman and the No. 88 Chevrolet team who played football at Alabama \u2014 said the weight he works with decreased from up to 400 pounds to 225 and 250 pounds. He said he now weighs about 220 pounds and dropped 30 since switching to NASCAR, which helps him move faster around the race car.\n\n\u201cWe do more athletic training as far as footwork and mobility, making sure we stay loose, making sure our joints feel well,\u201d said John Gianninoto, the fueler for Chase Elliott and the No. 9 Chevrolet. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to go in there and build mass and huge strength. You don\u2019t want to be the guy who can\u2019t move.\u201d\n\nAgility and balance are factors on pit road as well. Gianninoto joked it\u2019s \u201calmost like a ballet out there.\u201d And as opposed to football when players are moving and reacting based on specific situations, Tyrrell explained a fast pit stop is more about repeating the same steps and motions as precisely as possible.\n\nWorking with pit crew and position coaches \u2014 along with strength trainers designing position-specific workouts \u2014 helps lessen the learning curve in a new sport.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve usually been strong throughout my football career, but holding 95 pounds of liquid above your shoulder changes your center of gravity massively,\u201d Tyrrell said about fueling the 18 Toyota.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I was going to be able to do it at first, but eventually, you adapt and develop some core muscles and stability. You learn how to move with sloshing liquid above your head.\u201d\n\nThe brutal length of the NASCAR season creates a major difference in how these athletes approach their training. Several pit crew members pointed to football being more intense but condensed, whereas the racing schedule stretches across 10 months. There\u2019s also almost no offseason because the schedule starts in February with the Daytona 500, the Super Bowl of NASCAR, and if a team wins one of the 26 regular season races, it\u2019s automatically locked into the 10-race playoffs, hoping to still be in the hunt for the championship race, which is Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nSo training for endurance and injury prevention are just as critical as strength and agility. That translates to an intensified focus on compensating for muscle imbalances, recovery and cross-training with low-impact activities.\n\nMike Metcalf \u2014 who was a running back for Appalachian State from 2002 to 2004 \u2014 is the gasman for Kyle Larson and the No. 42 Chevrolet team for Chip Ganassi Racing, but he\u2019s also in a player-coach role as the pit crew trainer. He said he and the crew will sometimes bring in a rotational strength coach \u2014 who actually specializes in golf \u2014 because \u201cif you\u2019re always carrying tires one way, there\u2019s going to be a lot of imbalance\u201d that needs to be corrected.\n\nOn Mondays after race day, Metcalf said he also likes to have his guys swim or do yoga to counter the position training and CrossFit- and football-inspired workouts they do throughout the rest of the week before hitting the road for the next race track. It\u2019s all part of maintaining their bodies and building endurance for the 36-race season.\n\n\u201cOn some of our conditioning days, our training staff tries to build some fun into it because it is monotonous and a long drag,\u201d Tyrrell said of the Joe Gibbs Racing crews\u2019 workouts. \u201cSo we\u2019ll go cycling or swimming or go play frisbee or something. We\u2019ll do some stuff like that for sure just so you can survive a 10-month season.\u201d\n\nBut like any other professional sport, injuries happen and can range from minor to season-ending, from freak accidents to the most common ailments. Crew members will compete through injuries and issues when they can, and that\u2019s where the trainers and physical therapists come into play \u2014 like Gene Monahan at Hendrick Motorsports.\n\nMonahan spent 49 years working within the New York Yankees organization, and from 1973 until his retirement in 2011, he was the team\u2019s athletic trainer.\n\nA longtime racing fan, he said he works three days a week with up to 50 people from the pit crews on the team\u2019s four cars, plus the ones who are in a developmental program. A lot of the varying injuries are similar to what he saw with the Yankees, and while the strength and conditioning staff builds most of the workouts for crew members, sometimes his work will extend beyond traditional sports medicine to help with someone rehabbing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll develop certain exercises for them, like core work for guys with low backs or shoulder work loosening the shoulder when they have similar things that a lot of our pitchers used to have,\u201d Monahan said.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of lower backs, we get beat up elbows and wrists from guys with (air) guns and tires, and we get guys who are hit with lugnuts and stuff. But we get a lot of back and cervical spine stuff, neck stuff, because of the rotational work and the lifting and the pounding and the grinding and the overall length of the season.\u201d\n\nThe combination of proper training, physical therapy and sports medicine contributes to pit crew members surviving the arduous season but also helps their bodies adapt as they exit their early- and mid-20s, Stewart-Haas Racing\u2019s Knost said.\n\nIn a big-picture sense, he also explained how teams utilize a similar training approach to a football season \u2014 just a very elongated one. They\u2019ll start off the season with high-intensity workouts and practices, and they might allow that to slightly fluctuate through the first part of the year. But once they get to the second half of the season \u2014 particularly the final dozen or so races \u2014 everything is tapered down, and they\u2019re focused on maintenance.\n\nThat\u2019s where they are now with only Sunday\u2019s championship race left in the 2018 season.

Right now, the No. 1 reason is that this typically $270 convection oven is on sale for the lowest price we've seen. We named the Smart Oven the best toaster oven we've ever tested, since it basically functions as a smaller oven while still making perfectly crispy toast.

Under $100: Our favorite smart bulbs\n\nHue lights transform your home into a wonderland. (Photo: Philips Hue)\n\nIf you're still using incandescent bulbs at your house, I have one question. Why? They burn out way too fast, use too much energy, and get crazy hot, which sucks if you need to change one right after it dies. LED bulbs, on the other hand, don't get hot, last for literally years, and are way more energy efficient. And these LED bulbs in particular are even more amazing because you can control them with your phone or your smart assistant (Google, Apple, or Amazon all work).\n\nPhilips Hue Smart Bulbs are the best smart lighting option out there. I've had Hue bulbs in my house for nearly 5 years and we haven't had a single bulb die. Plus, you can choose any color you could ever want, whether you want a traditional warm white, a cool white, or maybe red or green or purple. Hue lights do it all, and right now you can get a starter kit with two bulbs and the bridge for $100, $50 less than usual. From there, you can add up to 50 lights to the bridge, so you can cover the whole home.\n\nGet the Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance 2-Bulb Starter Kit for $99.99 on Amazon (Save $50)\n\n3.

Well, OK, our TV expert tests a lot of TVs and the rest of us ooh and ahh over the nicest ones. The LG C8 got a lot of attention after our expert put it through all sorts of lab tests and real-world trials and said it's the best TV he's ever seen. He also liked LG'S higher-end E8 model ($2,300 on Amazon), but the C8's combination of quality and price made it vastly superior in our book. Right now, the originally $2,500 TV discounted to $1,700, matching the lowest price we've ever seen on Amazon or at Massdrop.\n\nGet the LG C8 OLED Smart 4K TV for $1,696.96 (Save $900)\n\n3.

There, I said it. Not only is it the best electric kettle we've tested, but it's my personal favorite. I had one once and replaced it with a lesser quality kettle and have been miserable since. Right now, Cuisinart has discounted the PerfecTemp kettle to the lowest price we've ever seen, so don't miss your chance to score this usually $90 appliance for just over $60.\n\nGet the Cuisinart PerfecTemp Electric Kettle for $60.83 (Save $29)\n\n4.

But disposable cups from the shop down the street don't keep your drink warm for the whole ride. Plus, you have to hold them the whole time, which makes it hard to read your Kindle or scroll through Facebook.\n\nThese Contigo mugs are the best affordable travel mugs we've ever tested because they keep drinks hot for hours and hours, and they don't leak so you can toss your coffee in your bag if you don't want to carry it the whole way. The matte black is my personal favorite option, and it hadn't gone on sale all year until now.\n\nGet the Contigo Autoseal West Loop Insulated Travel Mug in Matte Black for $14.96 (Save $5)\n\nPrices are accurate at the time this article was published, but may change over time.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.

Darnold is still considered the future of the franchise, no matter how much he struggles this season. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, FIle) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 By the time Todd Bowles walked off the field at MetLife Stadium and disappeared into the tunnel, many New York Jets fans figured that was the last time they'd see him on their team's sideline.\n\nNot quite. Not yet.\n\nAn embarrassing 41-10 loss to the equally lowly Buffalo Bills last Sunday brought out the venom from Bowles' biggest detractors \u2014 the number of whom has quickly multiplied over the past several weeks. They hoped the bye-week break would bring about a change at the top in response to the team's miserable 3-7 start.\n\nOwner Christopher Johnson instead opted to not fire Bowles right now \u2014 much to the dismay of a large portion of the fan base.\n\n\"I understand,\" wide receiver Jermaine Kearse said. \"Everybody is frustrated. I understand the fans are frustrated. We're frustrated. It's understandable. We're going to stick together. We're going to stick with Todd. We're going to have his back.\n\n\"And, we're going to take the bye week, regroup and try to figure this (stuff) out.\"\n\nThe Jets have six games left and will be hard-pressed to even match the 5-11 records they put up in each of the past two seasons. New York has two games against New England, including a home matchup out of the break, and meetings with Tennessee, Buffalo, Houston and Green Bay \u2014 no gimmes in the bunch.\n\nThe general feeling is that Bowles' fate is, in fact, sealed and the Jets will embark on a coaching search as soon as the regular season ends.\n\n\"We have to own it and have a week to live with it,\" Bowles said of having the bye after such a brutal loss. \"They get some time off, make sure they rest up and get healthy. We're going to come back and try to win six games, one at a time, and see who wants to play.\"\n\nThe one player everyone's eyes will be on is rookie quarterback Sam Darnold, whose right foot strain kept him out of the debacle against Buffalo. Bowles said the No. 3 overall pick is also now out of the walking boot he was in last week during practice, a positive sign that he could perhaps soon return.\n\nDarnold's development will again be at the top of the list of priorities, regardless of the job status of Bowles and his staff. The former USC star has thrown a league-leading 14 interceptions and struggled in three straight losses before his injury.\n\n\"I think it's just me, at some moments in the game, getting in my own head,\" Darnold said. \"I've just got to stay true to my progressions, stay true to the confidence that I normally have and just go out there and sling it.\"\n\nDarnold has shown some positive signs, making some impressive plays while also receiving rave reviews from his coaches for his ability to mentally digest the game.\n\nHe has made lots of mistakes, too, as he struggles through rookie growing pains. But Darnold is far from the only one having issues.\n\nJeremy Bates' sluggish offense ranks 29th in the NFL and has been inconsistent. Injuries to receivers Robby Anderson and Quincy Enunwa haven't helped, neither has the shaky offensive line play. The running game has also been mostly grounded the past few games since gaining 323 yards against Denver in Week 5.\n\n\"Right now, we're not scoring touchdowns,\" Bates said. \"That's my responsibility to get our players to score touchdowns and I'll do a better job at that.\"\n\nThat's the resounding feeling all around the facility, from the coaches to the players to general manager Mike Maccagnan, whose spotty record in the draft and free agency has contributed to a lack of roster depth.\n\nWhile first-rounders Leonard Williams, Darron Lee and Jamal Adams \u2014 and even Darnold \u2014 are starters and major contributors, only 12 of the 22 players drafted from 2015-17 remain on the roster. The bulk of the crop from those draft classes should be major depth pieces now, namely wide receivers ArDarius Stewart (third round, 2017) and Chad Hansen (fourth, 2017). Instead, the Jets will look to make a big-time splash in free agency next offseason with about $100 million in salary cap space.\n\n\"This is an offseason we feel really good about,\" Maccagnan said. \"We've done a lot of work already and we're going to do a lot more work on the pro free agency.\"\n\nStaying patient is a tough task for most Jets fans. After all, they've been doing that for 50 years, since the franchise's one and only trip to the Super Bowl.\n\nAnger and frustration are the prevailing emotions right now among the team's most dedicated followers. And, the Jets insist they're right there with them.\n\n\"Imagine if it's your job, how much more upset you are,\" quarterback Josh McCown said. \"So I think that's the case for us. I think that's what I would say, is that we feel the same way. We're probably even more so than them because it's our livelihood and this is the game that we love. So when you go out and play like that, we're upset about that and it's unacceptable.\n\n\"We want to find a way to make it different. That's the main thing.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

We tried out apps, phone features and the Do Not Call registry to stop them USA TODAY\n\nA woman using a mobile phone. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nYour cellphone rings. You don\u2019t recognize the number on the screen, but the call appears to be coming from your area code \u2013 perhaps even your exchange. Maybe the display shows it\u2019s coming from your town.\n\nSo you answer \u2013 and the unwanted recorded message begins.\n\nA voice wants to sell you an extended warranty for your car, or a timeshare in a vacation spot, a loan to refinance your home.\n\nIt might even be a Chinese-language message about a purported package awaiting pickup at the local consulate.\n\nConsumers, rejoice: An attack plan is nearing deployment against the billions of illegal robocalls that have made telephones and smartphones virtual weapons of mass frustration.\n\nEmerging from a years-long effort by government, telecommunications and computer experts, the plan will use a verification system to stop robocall companies from masking the true numbers of those billions of unwanted and illegal calls.\n\nThe tactic, known as spoofing, fools consumers by causing their Caller-ID systems to indicate falsely that the robocalls come from the phone numbers of familiar businesses, organizations, friends or acquaintances.\n\nThe verification system targets a problem that's a top priority for the Federal Communication Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThe FTC last year identified robocalling as the No. 1 consumer complaint category: More than 1.9 million complaints against the practice were filed during the first five months of 2017.\n\nU.S. consumers and businesses were barraged with roughly 30.5 billion robocalls in 2017, according to YouMail, a company that provides a service to block such messages. That broke the record of 29.3 billion calls set just a year earlier. And the company estimates the 2018 total will jump to roughly 48 billion.\n\nThe pace hasn't slackened. U.S. phones received some 6.1 million robocalls per hour in September 2018 alone, YouMail reported.\n\nMany robocalls aren't just annoying \u2013 they're illegal. Robocallers are not permitted to send telemarketing messages that haven't been approved by the recipients, or to dial numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry.\n\nOne robocall executive who has been sued by the FTC acknowledged that the growing torrent poses a problem.\n\n\"Obviously, the underlying issue is the calls are illegal,\" Aaron Michael Jones, affiliated with several robocalling companies, told an FTC investigative hearing in 2015. \"We know that already.\"\n\nSome robocalls are permissible. Government regulators have carved out exemptions for charities, for example, and also for political campaigns.\n\nMajor U.S. telephone service providers are expected to start integrating the verification system with their networks in upcoming months, with a more complete ramp-up to follow in 2019.\n\nThere's no agreement yet on what consumers will see in their Caller ID systems \u2013 a green check mark, perhaps, or another symbol to indicate the caller has the authorization to use the number that's displayed.\n\nParticipants in the anti-spoofing effort predict it will produce a progressive drop in robocalls. \"It will be an ongoing battle that will gradually get better,\" said Jim McEachern, principal technologist for the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions.\n\nHe likened it to the effort that turned email spam from a similar aggravation into a relatively manageable problem.\n\nConsumer advocates say the effort represents a good first step \u2013 but call for stronger safeguards.\n\nMargot Saunders is senior counsel for the National Consumer Law Center. The verification system sounds promising, she said. But it's \"just one piece of the overall robocall puzzle.\"\n\nMcEachern says he's seen a demand for solutions.\n\n\"The vast majority of my career, when I told people what I do, their eyes would glaze over,\" McEachern said. \"Now, when I tell them what I'm doing, their eyes light up.\"\n\nSTIR and SHAKEN\n\nThe verification system is designed to correct an unforeseen problem that developed roughly two decades ago.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, the telecommunications industry launched a technology capable of transmitting telephone voice calls via a broadband Internet connection instead of a regular phone line.\n\nOne of the support services to grow out of the technology was Voice Over Internet Protocol. Robocalls use VoIP because it's inexpensive. It also enables users to enter anything imaginable as the source of the call.\n\nThat identification, true or false, automatically is conveyed to consumers.\n\nJon Peterson is an expert in internet and telephone operational protocols with Neustar, an information services provider with expertise in identity resolution. He has worked on the new verification system.\n\n\"You get email all the time from people who are not what it says in the header field,\" Peterson said. \"You can kind of think of what we've developed as the next generation of Caller ID.\"\n\nThe developers have dubbed the system STIR and SHAKEN, a geeky engineering homage to fictional British spy James Bond's martini preference.\n\nSTIR, or Secure Telephone Identity Revisited, is a call-certifying protocol. SHAKEN, or Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs, verifies the caller's right to use their phone numbers.\n\nWhen you make a call, your phone carrier will use your identifying number to create a digital signature, or token, that will accompany the call as it is being completed.\n\nAt the other end, the system verifies that nothing was tampered with and ensures that the call came from \"someone who has a legitimate right to use that number,\" McEachern said.\n\nHowever, the attack plan is no silver bullet solution.\n\nIt won't block any phone calls \u2013 including robocalls. Consumers eventually are expected to see an as yet undetermined signal that will indicate calls that have been verified, a feature intended to help guide decisions about whether or not to pick up.\n\nThe system also is expected to aid the work of companies that provide call-blocking apps for consumers. They already try to block robocalls by looking for calling patterns to identify calls from suspicious numbers.\n\nThe Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions on Thursday issued a request for proposals to get an administrator to apply and enforce the STIR and SHAKEN rules.\n\n\"Everything we're doing today is just going to be infinitely stronger once spoofing is eliminated,\" said Jonathan Nelson, a member of the research team and the director of project management for Hiya, an app company that provides Caller ID and spam protection services.\n\nThe room where it happened\n\nA team of telecom experts began discussing technological approaches to combating robocalls in 2013with little notice from the outside world. The team included representatives of the giant traditional U.S. telephone providers, such as Verizon and At&T, and of cable and other companies that now offer phone services, such as Comcast.\n\nAs public outcry over robocalls mounted, a turning point in the team's planning came during a September 2015 workshop at the Federal Communication Commission's Washington headquarters.\n\nThe session included several experts working on the verification system, along with others from the telecom industry and public and private sectors.\n\nNeustar's Peterson and Chris Wendt, Comcast Cable's director of internet protocol communications services, recommended combining the STIR protocol started in 2013 by an international standards organization with the SHAKEN implementation system the team had started work on weeks before the FCC workshop. Other team members agreed.\n\nWendt said the consensus emerged from a collegial debate over technology: \"I think this will work,\" he said, and team members agreed. \"We have a plan to go forward.\"\n\nNonetheless, team members realized they needed the entire telecom industry, working together, to make the plan a working reality.\n\n\u201cEach provider is only as good as the other in the industry in stopping illegal robocalls. We need to get buy-in and help from big and small providers to fix this,\" said Martin Dolly, AT&T's lead member of technical staff and a main figure in the anti-robocall effort.\n\nThe fears evaporated in July 2016 when the FCC spurred the creation of a robocall task force and directed major traditional and wireless phone providers to provide free call-blocking services to customers.\n\n\"That changed, in many ways, what was a bunch of techno-weenies toiling away in relative obscurity,\" McEachern said. \"Suddenly the spotlight went on this activity as the most advanced effort to begin addressing the robocalling problem.\"\n\nThe work advanced in recent months with the creation of a panel of telecom company representatives who will continue to update the verification system as robocall companies seek ways to beat it.\n\nThe private sector approach would enable tweaks to be rolled out more quickly than if changes had to go through a lengthy government approval process.\n\n\"This would enable tweaks to keep the robocallers from being three years ahead of you, all the time,\" McEachern said.\n\nConsumer advocates want the government to be more aggressive.\n\n\"Why is the FCC, given the exploding problem of scams and spoofed calls, and unwanted robocalls generally, not moving to require phone companies to implement caller authentication services across the board?\" asked Saunders, of the National Consumer Law Center. \"This should not be a voluntary effort.\"\n\nAdditionally, Saunders said, YouMail data show that scammers are not the largest source of robocalls. More come from debt collectors for banks or other companies \u2013 some of which, she said, are ringing up the wrong people.\n\n\"That also raises the question of should we be able to block other numbers, even those that are authenticated, that we want to stop calling us,\" Saunders added.\n\nWho pays?\n\nThe FCC says it does \"not expect any carrier to directly charge consumers for the implementation costs of the service.\"\n\n\"While we are not mandating how carriers absorb these costs,\" the regulator said in a statement, \"it would be more expensive for the typical carrier to attempt to allocate costs and bill subscribers individually.\"\n\nThe FCC also says it expects the system to reduce some carrier costs, \"particularly with respect to customer service.\"\n\n\"These savings, as well as the goodwill from reducing the impact of robocalls on their subscribers, may more than offset the costs of implementation,\" the commission said.\n\nU.S. Telecom, the trade group of the nation's broadband industry, does not expect major carriers will bill customers for the verification system.\n\nKevin Rupy, the group's vice president for law and policy, said some smaller carriers might need help with the cost and could seek assistance from the FCC's universal service fund.\n\nAdditionally,AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and other major carriers have partnered with call-blocking and anti-spam partner companies to provide customers with increased protection, he said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/15/robocalls-verification-system-ftc-fcc-telecommunications-caller-id-shaken-stir/1682591002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Vikings-Bears Preview Capsule", "description": "Vikings-Bears Preview Capsule", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/15/vikings-bears-preview-capsule/38535195/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:06:13Z", "content": "MINNESOTA (5-3-1) at CHICAGO (6-3) Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET, NBC OPENING LINE Bears by 2\u00bd RECORD VS.

Results her office released Wednesday night sliced into McAdam\u2019s lead, putting Love less than half a percentage point behind him.

He is the mayor of Salt Lake County, where 85 percent of voters in the district live.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called out Love by name in a news conference last week where he bashed some fellow Republicans, saying she and others lost because they didn\u2019t fully embrace him. His comments came despite the outcome of the vote being in doubt.\n\nUtah law allows challenges to a voter\u2019s eligibility if they are suspected of trying to vote in someone else\u2019s name, but it is unclear how that applies to mail-in balloting recently adopted by most counties in the state. Utah Elections Director Justin Lee declined to comment.\n\nLove, who became the first black Republican woman elected to Congress in 2014, argues there must be a process for challenging a signature on an envelope swiftly, since after it\u2019s confirmed the ballot is permanently separated from the envelope to be tabulated. Salt Lake County has signaled it may complete its vote count by Thursday, the suit said.\n\nBut nothing in their petition shows any violation of election law in Salt Lake County, the county said in a motion asking a judge to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nWhen tabulating mail-in ballots, county elections workers compare signatures to verify a voter\u2019s identity. If a worker decides a voter signature doesn\u2019t match the one on file, the person gets a letter informing them and asks them to sign and return an affidavit confirming their identity.\n\nMore: Sen.

(AP) \u2014 With little money to spend and few impact players interested in signing with the Bills given the uncertainty at quarterback this past offseason, general manager Brandon Beane understood Buffalo's offense was going to struggle.\n\nLittle did he realize how much.\n\n\"There's nobody that goes into a season and looks for either side of the ball to have a down year and to be statistically where our offense is,\" Beane told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview before Buffalo entered its bye week.\n\nHe then recalled something former coach John Fox once said when the two worked together in Carolina.\n\n\"There's nobody going to rescue you in-season,\" said Beane, in his second year in Buffalo. \"You've got to dig out of it yourself. And all you can do is put your head down and keep working.\"\n\nMuch of the heavy lifting will have to wait for the offseason when Buffalo is projected to be more than $90 million under the NFL's salary cap, plus a current stockpile of 10 draft picks.\n\nOtherwise, a year after ending a 17-year playoff drought, the Bills (3-7) are realistically out of this year's postseason conversation because of a young, patchwork lineup dragged down by an anemic offense that's had four starters at quarterback.\n\nWhatever life that journeyman Matt Barkley breathed into the Bills during a 41-10 win at the New York Jets on Sunday, the 451-yard, five-touchdown outing that the Bills generated barely moved the needle on an offense that ranks 31st in total yards and points, and last in yards passing.\n\nThe struggles reflect a combination of issues including:\n\n\u2014 Breaking in rookie quarterback Josh Allen.\n\n\u2014 Unexpected offseason personnel losses, such as center Eric Wood being diagnosed with a career-ending neck injury, and left guard Richie Incognito forcing his way off the team after being unhappy with taking a pay cut.\n\n\u2014 Beane's intent to shed high-priced contracts in trading quarterback Tyrod Taylor to Cleveland and left tackle Cordy Glenn to Cincinnati, and not re-signing linebacker Preston Brown and cornerback E.J. Gaines.\n\nAnd there was one mistake the general manager owns up to making.\n\nBeane misjudged the team's lack of experienced depth at quarterback after trading AJ McCarron to Oakland a week before the start of the season, leaving Buffalo with second-year player Nathan Peterman as the starter, and Allen as the backup.\n\nOnce Allen was forced to take over after Peterman reverted to his turnover-prone ways midway through a 47-3 season-opening loss at Baltimore, Beane waited until Week 5 to lure Derek Anderson out of semiretirement.\n\n\"Yes. One hundred percent. That's on me, and nobody else,\" Beane said. \"I should've known better. I tried to push it off a couple of weeks. It was a mistake that I regret.\"\n\nAt least Anderson was on the roster in time to step in two weeks later after Allen sprained his right throwing elbow in a 20-13 loss at Houston. Even then, Anderson struggled in throwing four interceptions and losing two fumbles in his next two starts before being sidelined by a concussion.\n\nPeterman was cut this week, while Allen has resumed practicing and is in line to reclaim the job once Buffalo returns to host Jacksonville on Nov. 25.\n\nThough the Bills will likely endure more downs than ups with Allen over the final six weeks, Beane and McDermott stress the rookie's development is critical to the team's needs beyond this season.\n\nMcDermott raised eyebrows when explaining his long-term vision following a 22-0 loss at Green Bay, in which Buffalo managed 145 yards and Allen threw two interceptions and lost a fumble.\n\n\"There's going to be some of these moments. As hard as it is, you've got to understand where we are in the build,\" McDermott said. \"We're trying to develop a culture here. The culture, to me, trumps strategy.\"\n\nThere's no magic wand Beane can wave to speed up the process, which was evident this past offseason in failing to add talent on offense.\n\nIt's not as if he didn't try.\n\n\"We were in on guys on offense. But it got to the point where they were either higher than we thought they were valued,\" Beane said. \"Or there were cases where we lost out. A guy wanted to go where there was an established quarterback.\"\n\nThough Beane didn't name which free agents the Bills expressed interest in landing, one is receiver John Brown, who signed a one-year, $5 million contract with Baltimore.\n\nThe Bills were also interested in receivers Allen Robinson and Taylor Gabriel, who signed with Chicago. In 2017, the Bills were interested in re-signing Robert Woods, before realizing they weren't in a position to get into a bidding war for a player who eventually signed a five-year, $34 million contract with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nInstead, Buffalo committed its limited resources on defense in signing defensive tackle Star Lotulelei, pass-rusher Trent Murphy and cornerback Vontae Davis, who abruptly quit the team at halftime during a 31-20 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 2.\n\nDifficult as it's been, Beane isn't veering from his plan, and confident the Bills will improve.\n\nRookies, such as Allen, linebacker Tremaine Edmunds, defensive tackle Harrison Phillips, cornerback Taron Johnson and guard Wyatt Teller, are gaining valuable on-field experience. The cap situation is being resolved, though Beane stressed he's going to be \"judicious\" in spending, while continuing to focus on building through the draft.\n\n\"You can't just all of a sudden abort the mission because you're 2-7 and start doing this or just trading away assets to bring in a guy,\" he said, before the win at New York.\n\n\"It will hurt you in the future, and you're going to regret it,\" Beane added. \"We are frustrated. But I am wired that when you put a plan in place, you see the plan out.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I'm really, really confident that down the line we will find a resolution for this.\"\n\nThe ATP Cup, which will offer $15 million in prize money for players, will be held in partnership with Tennis Australia. The location and timing is intended to provide ideal preparation ahead of the Australian Open, with the first Grand Slam of the season starting in Melbourne a week later.\n\nTennis Australia is also a partner of the Laver Cup, another annual team competition, which began in 2017 and pits European players against a \"World\" team in September.\n\n\"We'll make sure that in 2020 we run a great event and we'll do whatever we can in partnership with the tour and others to ensure that Davis Cup is also a magnificent global event,\" Tennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley said.\n\nRoger Federer, the 20-time Grand Slam champion who co-founded the Laver Cup, said that he would like to \"wait and see,\" how the new tournaments go.\n\n\"If you make it in a team format, it can be fun,\" Federer said. \"Players enjoy being with somebody else, than just fighting for yourself. I see it in their eyes.\"\n\nNations will qualify for the ATP Cup by virtue of the ranking of their highest-seeded player and will then be split into six groups of four to compete in a round robin, which will feature one doubles contest and two singles matches.\n\nUnlike the Davis Cup, the ATP Cup will offer ranking points, which will be based on individual results. A player who wins all his matches \u2014 and the tournament \u2014 could claim 750 points.\n\nThe launch took place at the O2 Arena in London, where the men's tennis tour's flagship event, the ATP Finals, is currently taking place.\n\n\"We have Davis Cup, obviously, that has been the most historical team event,\" said top-ranked Novak Djokovic, the president of the ATP Player Council. \"And now we have the ATP Cup that is definitely going to be right up there in terms of its value from the players' perspective.\"\n\nThe ATP formerly held a World Team Cup in Dusseldorf, Germany, which ran for 35 years but was discontinued in 2012.\n\n\"All of us players around the world are unified and united in this event,\" American player John Isner said. \"It's the perfect week for it. Everyone wants to be in tip-top shape come the Australian Open and this event is going to allow us to do that.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rick Scuteri, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 As Eli Manning drove the New York Giants down the field for the game-winning touchdown in the latest loss for San Francisco, two players expected to be foundation pieces for the 49ers defense were only spectators.\n\nReuben Foster missed his 10th game in two seasons because of injuries and suspension and fellow 2017 first-round pick Solomon Thomas remained on the sideline because he's not good enough to be on the field at crunch time.\n\nWhile the season-ending knee injury to quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo back in September probably ended any realistic chances of the 49ers being contenders this season, the lackluster production from coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch's first draft class has been a major negative this season as the 49ers (2-8) head into the bye week with the second-worst record in the NFL.\n\nWhen the Niners return next week for the final six games, those second-year players such as Thomas, Foster and cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon need to show they can be foundation pieces the team expected when they were drafted in the first three rounds.\n\n\"I want them to sit there and really think of what their goals are for the rest of the half,\" Shanahan said of his message to the entire team. \"Do they want to solidify themselves as a starter, a backup? Do they want to be a part of it here? Do they want to be one of the answers or a solution to what we're going through? And really when they think about all that and they understand it all and what they want, which I'm sure they all have high aspirations, I want their actions to come back and show that.\"\n\nThe second-year players haven't shown that yet. Thomas, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2017 draft, has struggled even to get onto the field in pass-rushing situations. He lacks the speed to come off the edge and hasn't shown the ability to be one of the team's top inside rushers so he has been mostly relegated to being only a base defender.\n\nThomas' only sack of the season came when Oakland's Derek Carr ran out of bounds instead of throwing the ball away two weeks ago. Thomas has just three other quarterback pressures the past seven games.\n\nThe Niners traded back into the first round in 2017 to select Foster 31st overall. He showed great promise in 10 games as a rookie, but was suspended the first two games this year following off-field issues in the offseason. He hasn't been an impact player once he returned as he has been hampered in part by shoulder and hamstring injuries.\n\nFoster has no sacks, interceptions, fumble recoveries or forced fumbles in his career and has 10 missed tackles already this year, with his tackle efficiency ranking fourth worst among linebackers with at least 200 snaps.\n\n\"He's going to be fine,\" defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. \"I get it, in this day and age, with everything needs to happen now. But, I promise you, Reuben is going to be just fine when this is all said and done. Second-year player, to push the panic button is way, way premature in my mind.\"\n\nSaleh says he believes the second season can be toughest on a player as outside influences can make them forget what made them successful as rookies.\n\nVeteran cornerback Richard Sherman sees that mostly as a crutch that needs to be avoided.\n\n\"Everybody hears about the rookie wall and the sophomore slump,\" he said. \"Those things can happen. It can be a slippery slope. You can go downhill in a hurry.\"\n\nThe team's other third-round pick C.J. Beathard, was benched after struggling in place of Garoppolo. Fourth-round running Joe Williams was cut before the season after never suiting up for the team and two of the bright spots from last year, fifth-round receiver Trent Taylor and seventh-round safety Adrian Colbert, have regressed.\n\nAbout the only success so far from that class has been fifth-round tight end George Kittle, who has emerged as a star in his second year, ranking third among all tight ends with 50 catches for 775 yards this season.\n\n\"I believe that we can get more out of our guys,\" Shanahan said. \"I believe that's up to myself, I believe that's up to coaches and I believe it's up to the players. I think there are guys that are doing some good things. But, even the guys who are doing the best, I still think there's even more.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He shot and killed the former Beatle outside his Manhattan apartment on Dec. 8, 1980.\n\nChapman told parole board members that Lennon was \u201cincredible\u201d to him earlier that day when he autographed an album.

(Photo: Alexx Henry Studios, LLC | jeremy lee)\n\nThe new world's largest cruise ship, Symphony of the Seas, will be christened Thursday in Miami in a ceremony that amounts to its official coming out party.\n\nActors and megacruise fans Carlos and Alexa PenaVega, along with their one-year-old son Ocean, will serve as godparents for the vessel at the event, which will kick off at PortMiami around sundown.\n\nThe PenaVegas are frequent Royal Caribbean cruisers. They got engaged on the line's Oasis of the Seas and spent a \"babymoon\" on sister ship Allure of the Seas. Carlos PenaVega, who starred on the Nickelodeon series \"Big Time Rush\" and hosted the Nickelodeon game show \"Webheads,\" has been a Royal Caribbean regular for 25 years.\n\nRoyal Caribbean says the christening will mark the first time an entire family has christened a cruise ship. In keeping with longstanding maritime tradition, cruise ships normally are christened by a woman.\n\nSoaring 18 decks high and nearly 1,200 feet long, Symphony is the largest cruise ship ever to sail out of PortMiami, the world's busiest cruise port.\n\nInitially unveiled earlier this year in Europe, the 228,081-ton vessel is built on the same platform as Royal Caribbean's 2-year-old Harmony of the Seas, the previous size leader in cruising. But it eclipses its sibling by more than 1,000 tons and offers several new features.\n\nAmong additions are a first-of-its-kind, two-deck-high family suite with a slide between floors, a revamped Boardwalk amusement area and a new laser tag attraction. Symphony also has more cabins than Harmony.\n\nWhile Symphony spent its first few months sailing in Europe, it only was a temporary assignment. The resort-like vessel has long been scheduled to sail in the Caribbean year-round starting this month. The ship arrived in Miami on Friday after a 12-night voyage from Barcelona. The arrival came a day after the vessel made a brief stop at Port Canaveral, Florida \u2013 its first call in North America.\n\nRELATED: Five things to love about Symphony of the Seas | Why we love giant cruise ships like Symphony | Yes, an even bigger sister to Symphony is on the way\n\nDesigned for vacationers who love big, bustling mega-resorts, Symphony boasts one of the highest concentrations of attractions for both adults and children at sea. Like its sister Harmony, it has a record-breaking thrill slide that plunges nearly 100 feet and a \"bionic bar\" with a robot bartender. It also offers three main pool areas, a water slide complex, an adults-only solarium, an ice skating rink, two rock climbing walls, a basketball court and a mall-like indoor promenade with shops, bars and eateries. Like Harmony, it has an open-air, tree-lined area called Central Park with restaurants, bars and upscale shops such as Bulgari.\n\nSymphony can hold up to 6,680 passengers and sails with a crew of 2,200, meaning that on busy weeks it can be home to nearly 9,000 people. It was constructed over three years at the giant Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in St. Nazaire, France \u2013 the same shipyard that built Harmony. Its cost was more than $1.3 billion.\n\nWith the addition of Symphony of the Seas, Royal Caribbean has 25 ships.\n\nFABULOUS PHOTOS: The world's 25 biggest cruise ships\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/11/15/symphony-seas-royal-caribbean-cruise-ship-christened-today/2009871002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "You'll never believe which job is the unhealthiest", "description": "These jobs are damaging to your health.

(AP) \u2014 Sean Chambers is the talk of the town.\n\nThat's what happens when you go from being the backup quarterback to the starter. Wyoming's true freshman signal caller did that three games ago and has had a rousing introduction to the Mountain West in helping Wyoming get on its first winning streak of the season heading into Saturday's game against Air Force.\n\nChambers tried to minimize the newfound attention he's gotten both on campus and back home in California, saying there's been \"a little bit\" of an increase in the amount of calls and text messages he's received from friends and family over the last month. It wasn't until a conversation with his mom last week that the reality of his situation sank in.\n\n\"I was talking to my mom, and we're like, 'Yeah, I'm actually playing college football,'\" Chambers said. \"It's what I've always dreamed about. It was a pretty cool feeling.\"\n\nHe's played it pretty well.\n\nThe plan, originally, was for the 6-foot-3, 215-pounder to redshirt, but since taking over for Tyler Vander Waal in the second half of the Cowboys' 24-16 loss to Utah State on Oct. 20, Chambers has looked like he belongs.\n\nChambers led drives that resulted in all of Wyoming's points against the Aggies and has led eight touchdown drives in his first 10 collegiate quarters. He accounted for three touchdowns in Wyoming's 34-21 Border War win over Colorado State, tossed a career-long 43-yard touchdown pass in that game and ripped off a career-long 64-yard scoring run the following week in a 24-9 win over San Jose State.\n\nChambers' dual-threat ability has left defenses with a choice: take away him or Nico Evans, the nation's second-leading rusher. They haven't done much to limit either one as Chambers and Evans have each reached the 100-yard mark on the ground the last three games.\n\nAs for how much of the offense Chambers can execute at this point, he said he doesn't have a certain percentage. The bye week gave Wyoming more time to further expand the playbook with wrinkles that Chambers is comfortable with, but don't expect the Cowboys' game plan against Air Force to stray too far from what's worked with him under center.\n\n\"We added a little more stuff, but I think the biggest thing is refining what we do,\" Chambers told the Casper Star-Tribune. \"We're not going to go out there and change the playbook completely. We're going to go out there, refine what we do and make sure we're clicking on all cylinders.\"\n\nChambers has accounted for 559 total yards and five touchdowns for an offense that averaged 25 points and 404 yards the last three games. Before he took over, Wyoming was averaging 16 points and 282 yards and went 10 straight quarters without an offensive touchdown.\n\n\"He put a lot of confidence in us, I guess you could say,\" tight end Tyree Mayfield said. \"Having him in the huddle is something different, something that even (former UW quarterback) Josh (Allen) didn't have. I don't know. It's hard to explain. But it's given us a lot of confidence, and we've been able to piggyback off of it.\"\n\nBall security has been an issue at times with three fumbles (two lost), but while the positives far outweigh the negatives early in his career, Chambers said he does his best to not dwell on any of it. Wyoming has won two straight games and needs to extend the streak to four if it wants to become bowl eligible for a third straight year.\n\n\"I'm just working hard not really thinking about the success,\" he said. \"Just going out there and, if I have a touchdown run, celebrating a little bit with my teammates and moving on to the next play. I kind of do that with games, too. Coach (Craig Bohl) has a 24-hour rule whether you win or lose. You still have the 24 hours to either commiserate or celebrate, and we move on from there.\"\n\nIt's a mindset for Chambers that's mature beyond his years. Coaches and teammates have seen it for three games now and don't expect it to change.\n\n\"You couldn't even tell it was the first game he'd played in,\" Mayfield said. \"He just stepped in the huddle like he'd been there for five or six years.\"\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Casper (Wyo.)

(John Walton/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Roger Federer is peaking at the right time \u2014 again.\n\nThe six-time champion advanced to the last four of the ATP Finals for a record-extending 15th time with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Kevin Anderson on Thursday.\n\nFederer, chasing the 100th title of his career, needed only a set to advance and produced his best performance at the season-ending tournament to end the round-robin stages with a 2-1 win-loss record.\n\n\"I've always tried to pace myself in a way ... that I would have something left in the tank,\" Federer said. \"I'm happy that this is another week like this. (It) didn't look like it maybe 72 hours ago.\"\n\nDominic Thiem's 6-1, 6-4 victory over Kei Nishikori earlier had left Federer with a modest task and ensured that Anderson became the first South African ever to reach the semifinals.\n\nFederer looked as if he was about to give up a break advantage for the second time in as many service games when he dropped to 0-40 attempting to close out the opening set at 5-4, but the 20-time Grand Slam champion found his first serve when it mattered most to hold.\n\nAnderson hadn't faced a break point in winning his first two matches. Federer, though, broke him twice more in the second set to claim top spot in the group and likely avoid a semifinal meeting with top-ranked Novak Djokovic.\n\n\"That was a little bit disappointing because I felt like I played some really good tennis so far,\" Anderson said. \"But the plus side is I'm through to the semis. That feels great.\"\n\nHaving struggled in an opening loss to Nishikori and relied mainly on his serve when defeating Thiem, Federer finally found some timing with his ground-strokes to apply consistent pressure on Anderson's serve.\n\nThe previously impenetrable Anderson serve wilted, with two double faults gifting Federer a 4-3 lead. Much to the surprise \u2014 and disappointment \u2014 of the partisan crowd at the O2 Arena, the Swiss great handed the break straight back with a series of errors.\n\nHowever, Federer steadied himself and made a delicate drop volley to break once more in the following game, before eventually closing out the set to maintain his record of having only missed the semifinals once in 16 appearances at the tournament.\n\nFederer lost just four points on serve in the second set. He used a backhand slice to break for 4-3 and the same shot brought up two match points at 3-5, 15-40.\n\n\"I think I had an aggressive-playing mindset,\" Federer said. \"A good variation as well with my slice.\"\n\nHaving saved a match point on his way to securing a five-set quarterfinal victory over Federer at Wimbledon, Anderson threatened another comeback as he won a 21-shot rally to get back to deuce, but there was to be no repeat this time.\n\nTwo more Anderson forehand errors ended the match and Federer won the group by virtue of their head-to-head record.\n\nWith Djokovic clear favorite to top his group, which concludes Friday, Federer has boosted his chances of avoiding the in-form Serb until the final.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

This week: Episode 8, \u201cYou Get What You Give.\u201d\n\nBest diversion: Davie\u2019s Mr. Miyagi move\n\nAfter finding a clue for some sort of reward, Davie, Carl and Nick decide to create some sort of diversion so the other two can look for the reward without the prying eyes of everyone else. For said diversion, Davie gets up on a rock and starts moving like he\u2019s alongside Mr. Miyagi and Daniel on the beach during that training montage. It works. Everyone chuckles at Davie\u2019s moves and none is the wiser when Nick and Carl find a vote-stealing reward.\n\nMost stacked roster: Davie, Nick and Carl\n\nBetween the three of them, they have an idol nullifier, a steal-a-vote and Davie\u2019s idol, that no one else knows about. Their roster is stacked like Kentucky. But, as we all know (especially Big Blue Nation), Kentucky never wins it all.\n\nGreatest editing: Reward challenge\n\nThe reward challenge was an endurance challenge, of sorts. Teams had to hold up sandbags and gradually reduce in size until someone dropped a bag. After establishing the format of the challenge and identifying the players, CBS dipped into the playbook to show B-roll of the island, a swooping helicopter shot, an animal crawling around and the sweat dripping from brows. It was the \u201cmuch time has passed and we can\u2019t show it all to you\u201d move. All that was missing was a time-lapse of a sunrise and sunset. Then comes a wide shot of the challenge, showing we\u2019re joining the Survivors already in progress. And a graphic appears: \u201cElapsed Time: 15 minutes.\u201d It was the longest 15 minutes for the Survivors since every 15 minutes they spent with Natalie.\n\nMost likely to star in a Scorsese movie: Carl and Alec\n\nAt two separate points in the episode, Carl and Alec have a curse word edited out (and blacked out with a box over their mouth). This is nothing new. People curse and you always know what they said that got silenced. (Survivor doesn\u2019t bleep. Editors simply dump the audio.) But the bad words said by these guys weren\u2019t immediately recognizable, even in context. As a professional profanity-dropper myself, I was impressed.\n\nBest hashtag: John\n\nImmediately after calling Christian charismatic but pronouncing it \u201ckrizmatic,\u201d John redeemed his verbal skills by deeming he upcoming voting out of his buddy Christian as the #BrochachoBlindside. Sounds like a new wrestling move for the Ambassador of the Abdominals.\n\nGreatest self-own: Dan and his awful trash talk\n\nDuring the reward challenge, enough time had passed that players had to hold multiple bags. At one point, Dan decides to hold three in one arm that he\u2019s raised toward the sky, acting as if he was more Hercules than Goliath. (Forget that cheerleader Kara was also holding three bags and wasn\u2019t making a big deal about it.) Then Dan looks to the other team and taunts them, suggesting that they\u2019re not manly enough unless they\u2019re holding three bags in the air like an offering to Jeff Probst. Five seconds later, he drops his bags. And somewhere, David and Goliath high-five\n\nGreatest Tribal Council ever: This one, maybe?\n\nWow. WOW. This was Minneapolis Miracle level stuff. I\u2019m still in disbelief, though I\u2019ll grant you that I\u2019m writing this about 90 seconds after it happened. In the lead-up to Tribal, the editing made it clear that the decision was between Angelina and Christian. Nothing that happened during Tribal suggested the vote would go any other way. The votes were cast. Then, out of the blue, Davie took out an immunity idol that was subtly brought up earlier in the episode (though upon reflection maybe it\u2019s not so subtle; Chekhov\u2019s gun and all) and plays it for Christian.\n\nAngelina knew that with all of Christian\u2019s votes becoming nullified, she was going home, so in a redux of Jacketgate, she began begging someone at Tribal Council to give her something for free. It was cringe-comedy pathetic, but she continued at it, going from begging to pestering then to a little bullying until Dan, for some reason, decided to play the idol for her. It was a glorious Tribal moment, as brash as it was unpredictable. But what did it mean?\n\nJeff read the votes, first for Angelina, then for Christian, and as everybody is trying to figure out what happens after a 6-6 tie between two players with immunity, Jeff drops an elbow from the top rope. With absolutely no foreshadowing or even a hint at what was to come, Jeff read a John vote. Then he read another.\n\nI\u2019ve been watching Survivor for years and don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so shocked. There have been big surprises and stupid moves and head-shaking moments of unpredictability, but I can\u2019t remember anything as out-of-nowhere as this. My wife gasped. My jaw dropped, then hung there while I wondered whether somebody was about to get taken to Slamtown. But John, true to everything we\u2019ve seen from him this season, was a class act after his shock defeat, even accepting Christian\u2019s offer to become Slamtown\u2019s comptroller. (In his post-vote confessional, John laughed at the irony of his #BrochacoBlindside prediction turning against him.)\n\nMost interesting unspoken (unknown?) moment: The actual vote tally\n\nIt was a brilliant gambit by Davie and Dan, right? Christian was going to be voted out with a big majority and then Angelina was next in line. Maybe Christian going was worse for Dan, but at least a huge idol threat was gone and Angelina should theoretically be in his service. Two idols; two saves. Or was it?\n\nJeff read the first two votes for Angelina, then the next seven for Christian. On vote No. 10, he read John\u2019s name and then, with the next vote, declared John \u201cthe ninth player voted out and the second member of our jury.\u201d That\u2019s only 11 votes. We later learn in the end credits that John actually got three votes \u2013 from Christian, Davie and Nick. Turns out was going home regardless of whether Dan played the idol for Angelina or not.

(Carl Juste/Miami Herald via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Kyle Busch has been showered in confetti and sprayed champagne in every victory lane in NASCAR.\n\nSo when the traditional pit stop for race winners in Phoenix underwent a makeover this season, the 2015 series champion knew his way around the site enough to have some gripes about the reconfiguration.\n\nThe fans cramped his party so much that their screams reverberated in his ears, and the setting was hardly ideal for the post-race pageantry.\n\nBusch made a pitch worthy of his own HGTV home-improvement special.\n\n\"I don't know why people don't ask me what we need in victory lane,\" Busch said. \"I go to enough of them. Just ask me what we need, all right? I'll fix them.\"\n\nFew drivers in NASCAR history know how to win quite like Busch. He did it eight times in Cup this season \u2014 he's closing in on 200 national series victories overall \u2014 and again represents Joe Gibbs Racing in NASCAR's final four.\n\nIf Busch takes the checkered flag in his No. 18 Toyota again Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway, he won't have a single complaint.\n\nHe'll be the NASCAR champion.\n\nBusch has largely avoided the scandals and headaches that have hit the other contenders and simply went wire-to-wire as perhaps the best driver in the sport.\n\n\"He's very fiery and has a will to win that probably isn't matched,\" crew chief Adam Stevens said.\n\nHis eight wins tied fellow title contender driver Kevin Harvick for the series high \u2014 and he could have knocked his Stewart-Haas Racing rival out of the championship picture with a bit of gamesmanship over the final laps at Phoenix.\n\nBusch could have eased off the gas and let Aric Almirola zip past for a win in an attempt to block Harvick from running for the title. It would have been a gutsy \u2014 and controversial \u2014 move few would have blamed him for attempting.\n\nAnd if they did? Busch would have accepted any scathing criticism, much as he has over the course of his career in which he's firmly entrenched as NASCAR's top villain.\n\nBut after a flicker of thought about the maneuver, Busch simply stepped on it. He's all about winning, so he took the checkered flag and now has a second Cup championship in sight.\n\nNo asterisks needed.\n\nThe 33-year-old Busch won the 2015 championship months after a broken leg and foot sustained in a wreck at Daytona cost him all but 25 races of the season. He hasn't missed one again yet in Cup, though he's scaled back his race commitments in the Truck Series and second-tier Xfinity Series. Busch raced in seven Xfinity races and five Truck races because new rules \u2014 a sort of Kyle Busch effect \u2014 have limited the number a Cup driver can enter in lower levels.\n\nHis win at Phoenix gave him 51 in Cup (11th on the career list) and 194 in all three series. Richard Petty, a NASCAR Hall of Fame driver, has the record at 200. But all the King's wins were in the Cup Series.\n\nAny way you count them, Busch seems to pass more NASCAR legends with each checkered flag.\n\n\"It feels good to be able to continue to climb up the ladder of the all-time wins list,\" Busch said.\n\nBusch will race Sunday against Martin Truex Jr., Joey Logano and Kevin Harvick for the championship at Homestead. The highest finishing driver of the four will claim the title, and this format has shown that it typically takes a race victory to claim the Cup.\n\nBusch won the race en route to the title in 2015. He finished third in the standings in 2016 and was series runner-up each of the last two seasons. With a win, Busch would join seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson as the only active drivers with multiple Cup titles.\n\n\"I think it would obviously be a continuation of my legacy in the sport and what I've been able to do and what I've wanted to accomplish here,\" Busch said. \"You know, you want to be the best of the best, and that's better than anybody that's ever been here before. Two hundred wins, seven championships, whatever it is, you've just got to go out there and continue to collect your accomplishments and hopefully we can do that.\"\n\nBusch battled a tire issue in the Daytona 500 and finished 25th before he started his drive toward the title. He had three second-place finishes over four races as an appetizer for a three-race winning streak at Texas, Bristol and Richmond. He also won at Charlotte, Chicago, Pocono, Richmond and Phoenix.\n\n\"When we've put ourselves in proximity to the front late in the race and had an opportunity to capitalize, we've been able to do it,\" Stevens said. \"I wouldn't pin the favorite label on us, and equally, I wouldn't put it on anybody else.\"\n\nHarvick is entangled in a cheating controversy. Truex's Furniture Row Racing team is about to shut down at the end of the season because of sponsorship woes. And Logano's season has been solid but hardly championship worthy.\n\nBusch, who also owns the Kyle Busch Motorsports team in the Truck Series, is vying for a title while also sharing the journey he's on with wife Samantha as they try to have a second child through in vitro fertilization.\n\n\"We won't know anything until after Homestead,\" Busch said.\n\nAt that point, it could be time to slap a baby on board sticker on a championship car.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Honestly, I just thought it would be really fun and would be good exposure for LSU if we offered him for football. Unfortunately, he didn't seem to be too (interested).

The U.S. agency is working with local authorities to determine if a crime was committed, she said.\n\n\"The relationship between us and the U.S. authorities is very good,\" Angela told USA TODAY early Thursday. \"We are cooperating.\"\n\nAruba is at the forefront of the investigation because the ship was sailing to Aruba at the time of the incident.

Did she jump?\" Angela said. \"That is what we are investigating, to find out exactly what happened.\"\n\nSome news outlets in Aruba this week have said the death was being probed as a possible murder.

Penney saw its net loss grow to $150 million, compared to a net loss of $128 million in the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected a net loss of $178 million.\n\nDuring the quarter, the retailer's top performing divisions were jewelry, women's apparel and men's apparel. The company \"made solid progress\" toward the \"right-sizing of our inventory,\" said chief executive officer Jill Soltau, who joined the company in October after Marvin Ellison departed to become the new CEO of Lowe's.\n\nThat move \"allows our great store associates to better focus on providing the excellent customer service J.C. Penney has traditionally been known for,\" Soltau said on a conference call Thursday with investment analysts.\n\nThe goal is \"to put J.C. Penney back on a path to profitable growth,\" she said. \"In the coming weeks and months, I will continue to meet with and learn from our teams throughout the entire organization \u2013 talking with them about what we\u2019re doing that\u2019s working well and, most importantly, what we can do to address our opportunities,\" she said.\n\nMore: Walmart shoppers flock there for toys, groceries, boosting sales heading into holidays\n\nMore: FAO Schwarz is ready for its close up: The iconic retailer opens new flagship in Manhattan\n\nIn addition to better managing merchandise inventory, J.C.

The retailer, which currently has more than 860 stores, has closed about 20 percent of its stores in recent years and 140 within the past year.\n\nSales at stores open at least a year declined 4.5 percent during the quarter.

Penney (JCP) shares were up 14 percent in afternoon trading Thursday to $1.39 after falling 12 percent in premarket trading.\n\nSoltau faces \"a monumental task,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \"This isn't so much as running up a down escalator, it's more akin to running up a super-speed down escalator with slippery oil poured all over it,\" he said in a note to investors.\n\n\n\nFor the retailer to suffer a sales decline \"at a time when consumer confidence and spending are at their peak is nothing short of atrocious,\" he said.\n\nJ.C. Penney must continue to pare its non-profitable stores in a strategy similar to that taken by Macy's, Saunders said.\n\nPart of Soltau's mission is to define J.C.

USA TODAY\n\nBenicio Del Toro as Richard Matt and Paul Dano as David Sweat in \"Escape at Dannemora.\" (Photo: Wilson Webb /Showtime)\n\nYou know the story, or maybe just parts of it.\n\nIn 2015, two men tunneled out of Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York. They had the help of a civilian woman who worked there, with whom both had sex. A multimillion-dollar manhunt followed. One inmate was shot and killed, the other was captured.\n\nThe seedy sexual details and \"Shawshank Redemption\"-style escape made the story of the prison break ripe for Hollywood treatment, and that's exactly what Showtime has given it in \"Escape at Dannemora,\" a limited series starring Benicio del Toro, Paul Dano and Patricia Arquette as the trio at the center of the tale.\n\nWhat could have been a rote retelling of a familiar news story is instead a transformative work that so vividly brings the drama to life it might as well be brand-new to its audience. Created by Brett Johnson and Michael Tolkin, \"Dannemora\" (Sunday, 10 EST/PST, \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four) features seven episodes all directed by Ben Stiller, who makes a stunning case for becoming a full-time director. His gorgeous and haunting work, combined with a career-best performance from Arquette, helps \"Dannemora\" transcend into one of the best TV experiences of the year.\n\nMore: The craziest prison escape in decades is now a Showtime miniseries ... from Ben Stiller\n\n\"Dannemora\" unfolds its story with the same patience and urgency required of inmates to tunnel out of a prison. After a brief opening set during the manhunt for David Sweat (Dano) and Richard Matt (Del Toro), \"Dannemora\" flashes back months before the escape, when Sweat and Matt work at the prison tailor shop, where they're supervised by Joyce \"Tilly\" Mitchell (Arquette).\n\nPatricia Arquette as Tilly in \"Escape at Dannemora.\" (Photo: Chris Saunders/Showtime)\n\nThe prison is rife with lax security and inappropriate conduct. As the series kicks off, Tilly and Sweat are already engaged in their tryst, sneaking off into the back of the tailor shop for sex at regular intervals. Matt is respected among inmates and even liked by the guards, especially Gene Palmer (David Morse), for whom he regularly paints surprisingly gorgeous portraits. By chance, Matt discovers a catwalk behind his \"honor\" cell block and surmises the pair could cut through the back of their cells with hacksaws and find a way out. He, too, seduces Tilly, and she begins smuggling hacksaw blades and other supplies to the pair as they make slow progress through the bowels of the prison.\n\nIt may be hard for some viewers to reckon the star of \"Zoolander 2\" with the excruciatingly raw and harrowing direction of \"Dannemora,\" but the proof is in the proverbial pudding. Stiller shows himself more than able to direct drama, thrills and action in a series that relies on all three. The director creates an intimacy with his shooting style, emphasizing the dreary, cramped nature of the prison and the desperation of the prisoners. The visceral, evocative way he follows the men through the physically taxing escape is powerful and terrifying. One scene that shows Sweat nearly getting stuck inside an 18-inch steam pipe is shot so claustrophobically, you may find yourself struggling to catch your breath.\n\nWhen Stiller turns the camera to Tilly, we find another story of a human who feels imprisoned.

But the actress imbues Tilly \u2013 who has been derided in tabloids \u2013 a depth missing from the media narrative.

(Photo: Brian Spurlock, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHistorians looking back on this 2018 college football season will certainly be scratching their head at the scenario that is the biggest flashpoint of Week 12. Notre Dame is unbeaten with two games left and has one major test remaining on its path to the College Football Playoff.\n\nThat test wouldn't be its biennial season finale at Southern California, though. It would be against Syracuse. Yes, with the Trojans reeling, the No. 12 Orange look like the lone obstacle that stands in the way of the third-ranked Irish making the field. The game will be played on neutral ground at Yankee Stadium with Syracuse not only looking to play spoiler, but also hoping to take a huge step toward a New Year's Six Bowl.\n\nThere's also a critical game in the Big 12, but it doesn't involve leaders West Virginia and Oklahoma, who will meet next weekend. Both No. 14 Texas and No. 18 Iowa State remain in the race and will meet in Austin. If the Longhorns win, they would likely just need an Oklahoma loss to clinch their spot. If the Cyclones prevail, a West Virginia loss would likely send them to Arlington, Texas.\n\nThe last game featuring ranked opponents sees No. 11 Central Florida put its 22-game winning streak on the line against No. 20 Cincinnati. The Knights are in great shape to grab the Group of Five place in one of the major bowls. But a loss could upset things and open the door for several other contenders, including the Bearcats."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "How to stop those annoying robocalls, once and for all", "description": "Robocalls are still a plague.

(Ennio Leanza/Keystone via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLUGANO, Switzerland (AP) \u2014 It was almost a no-win situation to begin with, and Switzerland certainly didn't win in the end.\n\nThe Swiss team, which reached the round of 16 at the last two World Cups and at the 2016 European Championship, is ranked eighth in the world. So a friendly game against Qatar, ranked 96th and without any sort of standing in the world of soccer, seemed to be an easy proposition, a chance to pile up lots of goals against an inferior opponent.\n\nQatar won, 1-0.\n\n\"For everyone it's difficult,\" Switzerland forward Xherdan Shaqiri told The Associated Press after Wednesday's match. \"You can only lose in these games.\"\n\nFor Qatar, the victory offered some legitimacy to a country that will compete in its first World Cup when it hosts the tournament in 2022. And for the rest of the world, it was a chance to see what kind of players Qatar has.\n\nEvery member of the team that came to Lugano plays in the Qatari league.\n\n\"To be honest, we didn't know these players at all,\" said Shaqiri, who plays for Liverpool. \"It was difficult to know because they play, I think, in their country. But, yeah, I was surprised that they play very well together, very fast players.\"\n\nSwitzerland dominated the match as expected, but the hosts failed to convert any of their chances in the southern Swiss city near the Alps.\n\nSwitzerland did hit the woodwork twice, while Qatar threatened with a couple of breakaways. On one of them in the 86th minute, Akram Afif scored the game's only goal.\n\n\"They were good, organized. I was really surprised that they play very well. They deserved to win,\" Shaqiri said. \"They had a few chances (in the) first half and they scored in the second.\n\n\"Maybe they were lucky they didn't concede because we played good in the second half. We created a lot of chances but we didn't score. The pitch was not so good to play so for them it was better. But they deserved to win.\"\n\nSwitzerland had scored six goals in matches against Panama and Iceland this year, and five against Hungary a year ago. All were ranked above the Qataris.\n\nQatar is coached by Felix Sanchez, who worked as a youth team coach at Barcelona for 10 years. The team defended well on Wednesday and played its way out of any danger rather than punting long balls out from the back.\n\n\"We also saw videos that they'd won against Ecuador and Ecuador is a strong team,\" said Switzerland midfielder Remo Freuler, who plays for Italian club Atalanta. \"And moreover, they've won a lot of matches recently.\n\n\"We saw that they also have fast players up front and a good defense. I don't think we undervalued them but we didn't get into the match.\"\n\nThe Swiss team will next play Belgium on Sunday in the UEFA Nations League.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In the Broncos most important game of the season, Mattison had his best game. Mattison rushed for a season-high 144 yards and two touchdowns in the victory over Fresno State last week. It was his third 100-yard rushing game of the season.\n\nNew Mexico: P Tyson Dyer was the Mountain West special teams player of the week after unleashing a school-record 84-yard punt last week against Air Force that died at the 1-yard line. Dyer's kick was tied for the second-longest in the FBS since 2013.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nBoise State's win over Fresno State was its first victory ever over a ranked team in the month of November. ... New Mexico needs four passing TDs over its final two games to set a new school record for most in one season. The current mark is 24. ...

His combination of skills, age and marketing cachet make him an excellent fit for any major league baseball franchise.\n\nParticularly the San Francisco Giants.\n\nHarper, a career .279 hitter with 184 home runs, rejected a 10-year, $300 million contract in September from the Washington Nationals.\n\nA look at why Harper could and should sign with the Giants \u2013 and why they should invest in him:\n\nOn the field\n\nIs there a job opening for a power hitter in San Francisco? Well, consider the Giants\u2019 season-leading home run totals the past five seasons: 16 (Evan Longoria), 18 (Brandon Belt), 17 (Belt), 21 (Brandon Crawford), 22 (Buster Posey).\n\nThat means Harper\u2019s 34 home runs - in what can be described as an off year for him - matched the combined total of the Giants\u2019 two most recent season leaders. Longoria, Belt, Crawford and Posey all return in 2019, when they\u2019ll range in age from 31 to 33. All are signed through 2021 or \u201922.\n\nSo yes, luring Harper to AT&T Park is easily the quickest antidote for an offense that finished next-to-last in the National League in runs, slugging and OPS.\n\nLongoria, Crawford, Belt and Posey are due $72 million in 2021 alone, but the Giants\u2019 financial flexibility can grow before then. The $34 million due pitchers Jeff Samardzija and Mark Melancon will drop off after 2019, and the $21 million annually due Johnny Cueto a year after.\n\nWhile luring Harper will require an annual commitment of around $35 million \u2013 let\u2019s say, 12 years and $420 million total \u2013 they will have Hunter Pence\u2019s expiring $18.5 million salary to apply. That said, it will be far easier to slide Harper into an outfield vacated by Pence and Andrew McCutchen than it will paying for it.\n\nWill Harper sign on to play in a park that\u2019s brutal on left-handed hitters? For every majestic shot that splashes into McCovey Cove, there\u2019s dozens of should-be home run balls that go to die in Triples Alley, which could also be named F-9 Alley.\n\nHarper has 184 career home runs, and maintaining his 32-homer pace for 162 games over 10 years would give him 504 by age 36. Will he want to spend his prime power-hitting years in a park that could curtail his potentially generational achievements?\n\nOff the field\n\nThe Giants are fortunate that top clients of agent Scott Boras tend to take their time signing free agent mega-deals: They need some breathing room to further chart their organizational course.\n\nThey must get younger and must re-tool after 89- and 98-loss seasons and proved it by hiring Farhan Zaidi as their new president of baseball operations. The hire was perhaps universally acclaimed in the industry as Zaidi \u2013 previously the Dodgers\u2019 GM and a top exec in Oakland \u2013 gets his first big-boss job and is expected to significantly alter how the Giants do business.\n\nWill a $35 million superstar who may celebrate his 30th birthday before a re-tooling is complete clutter that new landscape?\n\nPerhaps. But club CEO Larry Baer has long resisted a rebuild, insisting the fans who have shown up at least 3 million strong in 17 of the 19 seasons at AT&T Park deserve a consistent winner. Signing Harper could be a hedge of sorts: These next few years may be painful, but at least you\u2019ll enjoy the most talented player we\u2019ve had since Barry Bonds.\n\nIt will be up to Zaidi to pry open windows of contention, and a Harper commitment would entail several phases.\n\nPhase I would be next year and look an awful lot like recent times: Ride or die with veteran players and hope they reverse negative trends in health and production.\n\nPhase II might be the ugliest: Awaiting the expiration of those contracts (or paying other teams to take them off your hands) and the build-up of a still-bereft farm system.\n\nPhase III, circa 2022, would be Go Time: The payroll is lighter, Zaidi and his Circle of Brilliance have populated the farm and hey, what\u2019s this? Kris Bryant, Javier Baez, Francisco Lindor and Noah Syndergaard would be among free agents possibly up for bid. Harper would still be shy of his 30th birthday.\n\nWhy they could pull it off\n\nWith a franchise value approaching $3 billion and annual revenues of $450 million, according to Forbes, the Giants have the dinero. Harper has tweeted his appreciation of AT&T Park in the past, home run suppression notwithstanding, and of course it\u2019s yet another market just an hour\u2019s flight from his Las Vegas home.\n\nWill it happen?\n\nPossibly. Pursuing Harper while ushering in a more progressive, efficient front-office approach would be unprecedented; such pivots are almost always accompanied by cost-friendly teardowns. Zaidi might prefer such a clean slate, but he\u2019s also revered for his open mind and multi-faceted approach to problem-solving.\n\nRebuilding the Giants is his job. Keeping them relevant is Baer\u2019s. Harper could help fulfill both executives\u2019 objectives."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 5 Georgia big favorite in first game against UMass", "description": "Georgia looking to protect College Football Playoff hopes and avoid upset against UMass", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/15/no-5-georgia-big-favorite-in-first-game-against-umass/38533943/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:44:00Z", "content": "UMass (4-7) at No. 5 Georgia (9-1, No. 5 CFP), 4 p.m. EST (SEC Network) Line: Georgia by 45 Series record: First meeting.

Comis threw for four touchdowns and ran for two against Liberty and completed 23 of 33 passes for 183 yards in last week's 35-16 loss to BYU.\n\nGeorgia: TB D'Andre Swift ran for a career-high 186 yards with a touchdown in last week's 27-10 win over Auburn. It was his third-straight 100-yard game as he has emerged as the leader of the tailback tandem with Elijah Holyfield, who also has remained productive. Georgia is one of six FBS teams to have two players run for at least 700 yards. Swift has 808 and Holyfield has 767.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nUMass is 0-8 against SEC teams. The Minutemen have been competitive in their most recent games, including 2017 losses to Mississippi State (34-23) and Tennessee (17-13). ... UMass was 0-3 against SEC teams in 2016, including a close 34-28 loss to South Carolina. The Minutemen average 34.3 points per game, just under Georgia's average of 37.0. ... Georgia QB Jake Fromm ranks second in the SEC with his 67.5 completion percentage. The school record is 67.9 by Hutson Mason in 2014.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nNov 14, 2018; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) walks off the court with the game ball after the game against the Portland Trail Blazers at Staples Center. The Lakers defeated the Trail Blazers 126-117. James scored 44 points to surpass Wilt Chamberlain to move into fifth on the all-time career NBA scoring list. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWith his 44-point outburst Wednesday night, LeBron James continued to cement himself as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history, passing Wilt Chamberlain to move into fifth place on the all-time scoring list.\n\nNow the question isn't whether he'll pass Michael Jordan, who sits at No. 4 overall \u2014 but when.\n\nIn the wake of James' achievement Wednesday night, USA TODAY Sports set out to crunch the numbers and try to predict when the Los Angeles Lakers forward might pass Jordan \u2014 and the three other men ahead of him \u2014 on the all-time scoring charts.\n\nWhile this is an inexact science, James does have 15 seasons' worth of evidence upon which to draw. These predictions are largely based on his career averages. He's averaged about .701623 points per minute over the course of his career so far, for example, and about 38.7 minutes per game. That works out to about 2,069 points per season when factoring in he's played an average of 76.2 games per season so far. James has averaged 27.2 points per game in his career.\n\nInjuries and rest are the most difficult things to predict, of course. James is approaching his 34th birthday and could miss more games \u2014 or play fewer minutes per game \u2014 as he continues to age. The following predictions do not account for any such decrease and assume that his games and minutes played will largely mirror his career averages.\n\nPass Michael Jordan, move into 4th\n\nNeeded to pass: 868 points\n\nHow long will it take? 32 games\n\nPrediction: Jan. 19, 2019 at the Houston Rockets\n\nJames will almost certainly pass Jordan at some point in January, though its difficult to pick the specific game. This prediction (Jan. 19) assumes he will maintain his current averages and miss one game for injury or rest between now and then. But watch out: If James is slightly ahead of schedule, and stays healthy, he could very well pass Jordan six days earlier against the Cavaliers at Staples Center.\n\nPass Kobe Bryant, move into 3rd\n\nNeeded to pass: 2,219 points\n\nHow long would it take? 82 games\n\nPrediction: Late November 2019\n\nJames passing Bryant on the all-time scoring list is also a relatively safe bet. Barring any injuries or setbacks, this milestone would likely come a little more than a year from now, in late November or early December of 2019.\n\nPass Karl Malone, move into 2nd\n\nNeeded to pass: 5,504 points\n\nHow long would it take? 203 games\n\nPrediction: Late March 2021\n\nMalone had played 19 seasons in the NBA when he finally retired in 2005, and James has a chance to surpass \"The Mailman\" in his 18th season. At this point, James would be 36 years old and near the end of his third season in Los Angeles \u2014 the last guaranteed year in his contract. (He has a player option for 2021-22.)\n\nPass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, move into 1st\n\nNeeded to pass: 6,963 points\n\nHow long would it take? 256 games\n\nPrediction: Late December 2022; 38th birthday gift?\n\nWhat would it take for James to become the greatest scorer of all-time? Well, for starters, he would probably have to play until his 38th birthday \u2014 a little more than four more years from now, and nearly two decades after he made his NBA debut. He would also have to sign another contract, as his deal with the Lakers will expire during the preceding offseason. But if James can stay healthy, and remain effective, it's entirely possible that he could break Abdul-Jabbar's record midway through the 2022-23 season \u2014 perhaps right around his 38th birthday.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Nick Schwartz", "title": "#FanIndex: The Chiefs have the best quarterback in the NFL", "description": "Patrick Mahomes beat Tom Brady in our #FanIndex poll.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/fanindex-the-chiefs-have-the-best-quarterback-in-the-nfl", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/patrick.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:29:54Z", "content": "In his first full-time year as a starter, 23-year-old quarterback Patrick Mahomes has led the Kansas City Chiefs to a 9-1 start to the year while leading the league in passing yards and touchdowns.

Buzz60\n\nGas prices are falling as oil drops. (Photo: SbytovaMN / iStock)\n\nGas prices are plunging as the Thanksgiving holiday travel period approaches.\n\nA dramatic drop in oil prices over the last several weeks is fueling the decline.\n\nGas prices neared a four-year high in October, when they briefly topped $2.90 per gallon, but have since retreated.\n\nAmple global supplies of petroleum, which is refined into gasoline, have played a key role in delivering savings for consumers.\n\n\"Thanksgiving gas prices are getting carved up at a time of year when we\u2019re all used to getting the turkey ready,\" said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at fuel-finding app GasBuddy. \"This is a fairly dramatic turnaround.\"\n\nThe national average was $2.65 per gallon on Friday, down 7 cents from a week earlier and 23 cents from a month earlier, according to AAA. Prices are still up 9 cents from a year ago.\n\nBelow $2\n\nSeveral dozen stations across Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas were charging less than $2 per gallon as of Wednesday, according to GasBuddy.\n\nThat number \"could be several hundred by Thanksgiving Day,\" GasBuddy's DeHaan said.\n\nMore than 54 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles for Thanksgiving, according to AAA. That's up 4.8 percent from 2017 and marks a 13-year high.\n\nMore Money: Higher mortgage rates and unsettled stock market scare off potential homebuyers\n\nMore Money: Cord cutting accelerates even worse than first thought, with 1.2 million defections in Q3\n\nMore Money: Keurig launches Drinkworks Home Bar, a pod-based cocktail delivery machine\n\nDeHaan predicted that national prices could average somewhere in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 by Thanksgiving.\n\nOil's recent collapse is a big reason why. U.S. crude prices on Wednesday afternoon were trading in the range of $56.50, down about $20 per barrel from their 2018 high set in early October.\n\n\"The scale of the sell-off in oil has been bewildering,\" Mizuho Securities managing director Paul Sankey said in a research note.\n\nAmple supplies\n\nOne key factor was the Trump administration's decision to extend waivers to Iran on certain oil exports despite the reimposition of other sanctions amid a dispute over a nuclear deal. That has led to higher-than-expected Iranian petroleum output.\n\nMeanwhile, strong output by U.S. oil producers and other countries has kept supplies humming. Production from Russia, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. is at record levels, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nOther factors include declining global demand. Investors believe the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may cut production in a bid to prop up prices, but anticipating that relief hasn't helped boost prices.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/15/thanksgiving-gas-prices/1998466002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, David Jackson, USA TODAY", "title": "Under pressure over Russia probe, Donald Trump attacks special counsel Robert Mueller", "description": "Under criticism for picking an acting attorney general with a history of speaking out against Robert Mueller's Russia probe, President Donald Trump attacked the special counsel.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/15/under-pressure-over-russia-probe-donald-trump-attacks-prosecutor-robert-mueller/2009861002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/15/USAT/27750bf4-f5cc-486a-935c-91d4572fae70-AFP_AFP_1AV03M.JPG?crop=3550,1999,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:07:18Z", "content": "Vice President Mike Pence and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Singapore.

Tom Cotton, R- Ark. (Photo: Shawn Thew/epa-EFE)\n\nLame-duck sessions of Congress rarely produce good legislation. Legislators are least accountable now, with many not returning next year. And they\u2019re counting on voters tuning out after the election for the holidays. Nowhere is this more true than with so called \u201ccriminal-justice reform,\u201d which is just a misguided effort to let serious felons out of prison.\n\nHere\u2019s what genuine criminal-justice reform would do: reduce arbitrary government power over lives and protect us from the drug epidemic ravaging our community. Congress can take three simple steps to achieve these goals.\n\nFirst, we need to clean out the federal criminal code. Today, no one even knows for sure how many federal crimes are on the books. One estimate found between 10,000 and 300,000 regulations that can be enforced criminally, in addition to the more than 5,000 federal criminal laws.\n\nMany of those federal crimes would be funny, if they weren\u2019t so dangerous to our liberty. For example, there\u2019s a federal law against selling \u201cTurkey Ham\u201d as \u201cHam Turkey.\u201d Think such laws are never enforced? Think again. Gibson Guitars was prosecuted under a century-old law at a cost of millions of dollars to the taxpayers and the company because it allegedly transported wood in a way that may have violated laws of India. We should scrub the federal criminal code and remove such outdated and arbitrary laws. And we should create a transparent database of this shorter, more concise criminal code.\n\nYou don't have to know you did anything wrong\n\nSecond, many federal crimes do not require mens rea, or a \u201cguilty mind.\u201d Mens rea, a common element of most state crimes, means that the offender must have a certain state of mental culpability to be charged with the crime. Coupled with the vast and confusing criminal code, the lack of mens rea leaves Americans at risk of arbitrary prosecution for trivial conduct. Senator Orrin Hatch has been a champion for mens rea reform to ensure that, at a minimum, a defendant should have known his conduct was wrong before facing criminal charges. Congress should incorporate these concepts into criminal-justice legislation.\n\nMore: Don't jail addicts. Overdose prevention sites work, and the US needs to get on board.\n\nI once wrote mandatory minimum laws. After ties to Abramoff landed me in prison, I know they must end.\n\nThe next step in criminal justice reform is fewer laws\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThird, the federal criminal code hasn\u2019t kept up with the opioid crisis, allowing the epidemic to spread across the country. For example, current law doesn\u2019t reflect the potency of fentanyl, a highly lethal opioid responsible for killing tens of thousands of Americans each year. A trafficker can carry enough fentanyl to kill 5,000 Americans before the lowest mandatory minimum sentence applies, and these traffickers receive a mere five-year sentence for distributing enough poison to kill more Americans than died on 9/11.\n\nCurrent legislation doesn't solve the problem\n\nUnfortunately, the legislation moving through Congress includes no mens rea reform, no reduction in the criminal code, and no crackdown on deadly drug traffickers. Astonishingly, the bill goes soft on some of the worst crimes \u2014 trafficking heroin and fentanyl \u2014 by allowing most traffickers to spend up to a third of their sentence at home, where many of them will no doubt return to dealing drugs.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s best for Congress to pause on criminal-justice legislation and take the time to reform our criminal code, include mens rea as an element of most crimes, and strengthen the sentences for dangerous drug crimes. Congress can also focus on how to rehabilitate felons to help them get off on the right foot after serving their sentence. What Congress ought not do is rush through flawed legislation in a lame-duck session. Unaccountable politicians and those who live behind armed guards may be willing to gamble with your life \u2014 but why should you?\n\nSen.

And when a driver\u2019s position can go from the front of the field to the middle or back of a 40-car race while stopped on pit road \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 every tenth of a second counts.\n\nA fast pit crew is just as important as a talented driver; NASCAR is by no means an individual sport, though it is often talked about that way. Teams look for ways to tweak their stock cars to gain fractions of a second and do the same with their pit crews \u2014 turning from hiring mechanics who might be athletic to recruiting athletes and teaching them how to change a tire.\n\n\u201cRaw athleticism\u201d is the intangible teams seek out, and they provide their athletes with as many tools as they can financially afford to help them stay in shape and protect their bodies throughout the grueling schedule with almost no offseason, said Daniel Knost, Stewart-Haas Racing\u2019s athletic director.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to pass on the race track, so a lot of times, it\u2019s much easier to pass in the pits,\u201d explained Knost, who\u2019s also the team\u2019s director of vehicle dynamics.\n\n\u201cThe car can come in and you may be able to take three or four positions in a matter of seconds on pit road that would take you many, many laps, if you could do it at all, on track.\u201d\n\nParticularly for the larger NASCAR teams \u2014 like SHR, Hendrick Motorsports, Joe Gibbs Racing and Team Penske \u2014 an elite and wide-ranging training staff is at their pit crews\u2019 disposal. They work with position coaches, strength and conditioning trainers, physical therapists, nutritionists and even sports psychologists. They have full training facilities with gyms, recovery areas and sports medicine departments.\n\nMimicking the conditions of pit road is part of these teams\u2019 daily routines. For example, Team Penske has a 425,000 square foot indoor facility to practice pit stops, and Joe Gibbs Racing has a couple practice cars and a wall they jump off just like at the track. In many ways, the teams function like any other professional sports organization.\n\nSmaller teams like Wood Brothers Racing and Furniture Row Racing form alliances with larger organizations to have access to their ample resources, which can include using pit crew members from those outfits.\n\n\u201cWe practice, we work out, we watch film, we have a turf field that we do running and sprinting drills on,\u201d explained Matthew Tyrrell, the fueler for Kyle Busch and the No. 18 Toyota team who was a center and long snapper at Carson Newman, a Division II school in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cWe do strength training, we do speed training, we do practice the pit stops and have a film review from our practice stops and our race film to see where we can get better and make improvements.\u201d\n\nBut along with the adjustment of learning a new sport comes the challenge of redesigning workouts and, particularly for the former offensive linemen, even losing a little weight. They\u2019re working the same muscle groups as football with a focus on back and upper body for fuelers, jackmen and tire carriers and legs for tire changers. Core work for everyone is a must too.\n\nLandon Walker, the fueler for William Byron\u2019s No. 24 Chevrolet, was an offensive tackle at Clemson from 2008 to 2011. When he was first recruited by Hendrick Motorsports in 2012, he said he was \u201ctrying to bench press the house\u201d because that\u2019s what he was used to. But the 29-year quickly learned he doesn\u2019t need to consistently bench 300 pounds anymore. The focus now is more reps with less weight, which he said is especially helpful as he gets older.\n\nThey still bench press and do squats and clean jerks, but Rowdy Harrell \u2014 a tire carrier for Alex Bowman and the No. 88 Chevrolet team who played football at Alabama \u2014 said the weight he works with decreased from up to 400 pounds to 225 and 250 pounds. He said he now weighs about 220 pounds and dropped 30 since switching to NASCAR, which helps him move faster around the race car.\n\n\u201cWe do more athletic training as far as footwork and mobility, making sure we stay loose, making sure our joints feel well,\u201d said John Gianninoto, the fueler for Chase Elliott and the No. 9 Chevrolet. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to go in there and build mass and huge strength. You don\u2019t want to be the guy who can\u2019t move.\u201d\n\nAgility and balance are factors on pit road as well. Gianninoto joked it\u2019s \u201calmost like a ballet out there.\u201d And as opposed to football when players are moving and reacting based on specific situations, Tyrrell explained a fast pit stop is more about repeating the same steps and motions as precisely as possible.\n\nWorking with pit crew and position coaches \u2014 along with strength trainers designing position-specific workouts \u2014 helps lessen the learning curve in a new sport.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve usually been strong throughout my football career, but holding 95 pounds of liquid above your shoulder changes your center of gravity massively,\u201d Tyrrell said about fueling the 18 Toyota.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I was going to be able to do it at first, but eventually, you adapt and develop some core muscles and stability. You learn how to move with sloshing liquid above your head.\u201d\n\nThe brutal length of the NASCAR season creates a major difference in how these athletes approach their training. Several pit crew members pointed to football being more intense but condensed, whereas the racing schedule stretches across 10 months. There\u2019s also almost no offseason because the schedule starts in February with the Daytona 500, the Super Bowl of NASCAR, and if a team wins one of the 26 regular season races, it\u2019s automatically locked into the 10-race playoffs, hoping to still be in the hunt for the championship race, which is Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nSo training for endurance and injury prevention are just as critical as strength and agility. That translates to an intensified focus on compensating for muscle imbalances, recovery and cross-training with low-impact activities.\n\nMike Metcalf \u2014 who was a running back for Appalachian State from 2002 to 2004 \u2014 is the gasman for Kyle Larson and the No. 42 Chevrolet team for Chip Ganassi Racing, but he\u2019s also in a player-coach role as the pit crew trainer. He said he and the crew will sometimes bring in a rotational strength coach \u2014 who actually specializes in golf \u2014 because \u201cif you\u2019re always carrying tires one way, there\u2019s going to be a lot of imbalance\u201d that needs to be corrected.\n\nOn Mondays after race day, Metcalf said he also likes to have his guys swim or do yoga to counter the position training and CrossFit- and football-inspired workouts they do throughout the rest of the week before hitting the road for the next race track. It\u2019s all part of maintaining their bodies and building endurance for the 36-race season.\n\n\u201cOn some of our conditioning days, our training staff tries to build some fun into it because it is monotonous and a long drag,\u201d Tyrrell said of the Joe Gibbs Racing crews\u2019 workouts. \u201cSo we\u2019ll go cycling or swimming or go play frisbee or something. We\u2019ll do some stuff like that for sure just so you can survive a 10-month season.\u201d\n\nBut like any other professional sport, injuries happen and can range from minor to season-ending, from freak accidents to the most common ailments. Crew members will compete through injuries and issues when they can, and that\u2019s where the trainers and physical therapists come into play \u2014 like Gene Monahan at Hendrick Motorsports.\n\nMonahan spent 49 years working within the New York Yankees organization, and from 1973 until his retirement in 2011, he was the team\u2019s athletic trainer.\n\nA longtime racing fan, he said he works three days a week with up to 50 people from the pit crews on the team\u2019s four cars, plus the ones who are in a developmental program. A lot of the varying injuries are similar to what he saw with the Yankees, and while the strength and conditioning staff builds most of the workouts for crew members, sometimes his work will extend beyond traditional sports medicine to help with someone rehabbing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll develop certain exercises for them, like core work for guys with low backs or shoulder work loosening the shoulder when they have similar things that a lot of our pitchers used to have,\u201d Monahan said.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of lower backs, we get beat up elbows and wrists from guys with (air) guns and tires, and we get guys who are hit with lugnuts and stuff. But we get a lot of back and cervical spine stuff, neck stuff, because of the rotational work and the lifting and the pounding and the grinding and the overall length of the season.\u201d\n\nThe combination of proper training, physical therapy and sports medicine contributes to pit crew members surviving the arduous season but also helps their bodies adapt as they exit their early- and mid-20s, Stewart-Haas Racing\u2019s Knost said.\n\nIn a big-picture sense, he also explained how teams utilize a similar training approach to a football season \u2014 just a very elongated one. They\u2019ll start off the season with high-intensity workouts and practices, and they might allow that to slightly fluctuate through the first part of the year. But once they get to the second half of the season \u2014 particularly the final dozen or so races \u2014 everything is tapered down, and they\u2019re focused on maintenance.\n\nThat\u2019s where they are now with only Sunday\u2019s championship race left in the 2018 season. At this point, the pit crews are \u201ca pretty well-oiled machine, so we just want to keep the machine going,\u201d Knost explained.\n\nAnd before they know it, the season\u2019s over, they\u2019ll have a short break and be back to training for the Daytona 500 in February. It might not be obvious on the surface, but NASCAR\u2019s pit crew members are professional athletes, and that\u2019s how their teams treat them.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at their pit stops, I want to see us play with speed, aggression and swagger,\u201d Knost said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of this game that\u2019s very mental. You spend a lot of time sitting around and thinking about it, and then all of a sudden, the lights come on and the cars come down and we\u2019ve gotta do our job in 13 seconds.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Maeve McDermott, USA TODAY", "title": "Fans defend Demi Lovato from haters in post-rehab paparazzi shots", "description": "\"Some serious bullies on here!\" one commenter wrote after others fat-shamed the singer and actress for gaining weight following her hospitalization and rehab.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/15/fans-defend-demi-lovato-haters-post-rehab-paparazzi-shots/2010294002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/08/17/USAT/5df4e9ab-8e33-4d4f-90fe-b4814449f719-AP_People_Demi_Lovato.JPG?crop=2999,1716,x0,y19&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:52:36Z", "content": "Speaking at the Teen Choice Awards, Fifth Harmony star Normani Kordei and actress Sabrina Carpenter praise Demi Lovato for being honest about her struggles with addiction.

She gained weight, and? You\u2019re saying 'don\u2019t make fun of an overweight person' but you\u2019re doing the same thing. You\u2019re a bully.\"\n\nAnother commenter wrote, \"Some serious bullies on here! Who the (expletive) cares about her weight! She\u2019s beautiful now and she was before...Only now she\u2019s healthy!!

Beyond Nashville, Southwest also revealed five additional new routes, including new options in California, Texas and Nebraska, among others.\n\nBut Southwest also said it was abandoning a plan to fly from Paine Field, a secondary Seattle-area airport in Everett, Washington. Southwest said in January it would add five daily flights from the airport, but the carrier now says it instead has \u201centered into an agreement with Alaska Airlines to transfer the carrier\u2019s slot access\u201d there.\n\n\u201cThe decision is based on business considerations and terms of the agreement are confidential,\u201d Southwest said in a statement Thursday. Alaska Airlines simultaneously announced its initial schedule for Everett, which does not currently have commercial airline service.\n\nMore: Alaska Airlines: Everett Paine Field flights will begin Feb. 11\n\nAlso in Thursday\u2019s announcement: Southwest will drop two routes from Atlanta, ending nonstop service to both Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul in early June. All three of those cities are hubs for rival Delta.\n\nAs for Southwest\u2019s growth in Nashville, the carrier says it will be \u201coffering its biggest schedule ever\u201d there once the new flights begin.\n\n\u201cThese new flights are a result of the demand we\u2019re seeing from customers as they ask for more options to the places that matter most in their lives,\u201d Andrew Watterson, Southwest Airlines\u2019 chief revenue officer, says in a statement that also cites Nashville\u2019s \u201cthriving\u201d economy.\n\nSouthwest\u2019s additions from Nashville include new nonstop service to the California cities of Burbank and San Jose. Also on the docket is a new route to Omaha, Nebraska, though that route will operate only on Sundays. Additionally, Southwest will add nonstop flights from Nashville to Seattle and Norfolk, Virginia, restoring seasonal routes it offered previously. Southwest's Nashville-Seattle route last flew in September 2018 while the Nashville-Norfolk flight has not been offered since 2014. The flights will begin June 9.\n\nAside from new routes, Southwest says it will add more daily flights to its existing schedules between Nashville and Boston, Detroit, Las Vegas, Minneapolis/St. Paul, St. Louis and San Diego. The increased schedules will begin June 10.\n\nOn the international front, Southwest revealed new Saturday-only routes between Baltimore/Washington (BWI) and the Cayman Islands and between Houston Hobby and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.\n\nAlso included in the schedule update were dozens of seasonal routes that are returning, as expected. Among those are Houston Hobby-Portland, Oregon; Indianapolis-San Diego; and Seattle-Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nScroll down for a full list of all of Southwest\u2019s new routes.\n\nNashville-Burbank, California\n\nDaily service begins June 9.

Barnes for USA TODAY)\n\nArriving at Boca Raton Resort & Club in South Florida is an impressive experience. A long driveway lined with swaying palm trees leads guests past fountains and to the entrance of the opulent resort, which opened in 1926 as the Cloister Inn. The then-100-room inn was modeled after a Spanish castle, with Spanish-Mediterranean, Moorish and Gothic influences, and was built by Addison Mizner.\n\nJust two years after its opening, the Cloister Inn was sold and an expansion added more guest rooms, as well as a golf course and Cabana Club on the beach; the inn became a seasonal private club open January through March. Another sale and $8 million in renovations in the 1930s saw the inn change its name to Boca Raton Hotel & Club, and private railroad cars and yachts brought elite guests such as Herbert Hoover and several members of the DuPont family to the tropical destination. When World War II erupted in the 1940s, the U.S. Army purchased the hotel to house its Air Corps trainees. For four years, it was known as \u201cthe most elegant barracks in history.\u201d\n\nFast-forward to today and the entirety of Boca Raton Resort & Club sits on 356 acres in south Palm Beach County, between West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale. The resort can be considered three properties in one: Boca Raton Resort & Club (including the original Cloister Inn, a 27-story tower and The Bungalows), Boca Beach Club (bound by the Atlantic Ocean, Lake Boca Raton and the Intracoastal Waterway), and Yacht Club at the Boca Raton Resort, an exclusive hotel within the resort that makes its debut this month.\n\nIn total, Boca Raton Resort & Club has 1,047 guest rooms, including 187 suites, available in five styles of accommodation found throughout the entire resort. The Cloister, the original part of the resort, underwent a $30 million renovation in 2014 and each of the 361 guest rooms are at least 290 square feet. Two hundred and forty-two guest rooms are within the 27-story tower that overlooks the Intracoastal Waterway, with panoramic views of the golf course and Atlantic Ocean. For longer stays, The Bungalows features 120 guest rooms or 60 fully furnished one-bedroom apartments along the resort\u2019s historic golf course.\n\nOver at the Beach Club, which underwent $120 million in renovations completed in 2009, 212 custom-designed guest rooms overlook the Atlantic Ocean and the resort\u2019s half-mile of private beach. The Beach Club is accessible from the main resort by complimentary shuttle bus, or a shuttle boat for an on-the-water transfer.\n\nThe Yacht Club at the Boca Raton Resort debuts this month and offers an exclusive stay to its guests. All 112 deluxe guest rooms and suites are waterfront on the Intracoastal Waterway and feature private balconies.\n\nRegardless of which accommodations guests choose at Boca Raton Resort & Club, they can enjoy all of the amenities found throughout. In addition to the half-mile of private beach on the Atlantic Ocean, the resort features seven pools, a Surf School, boating and sailing, and South Florida\u2019s first FlowHouse, a dual-sided FlowRider wave simulator for flow and bodyboarding.\n\nResort guests can keep fit in the resort\u2019s two state-of-the-art fitness centers, or on the 30 tennis courts, 12 of which are lit for nighttime matches. Two championship, 18-hole golf courses, one of which is a certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary, await guests who want to tee off. Bocce ball and croquet courts are also ready to play. Or, relax instead in the 55,000-square-foot Waldorf Astoria Spa, the design for which was inspired by the Alhambra Palace in Spain.\n\nYounger guests can attend Mizner\u2019s Quest Club, a daily supervised kids\u2019 club that features a recreational sports deck, rooftop garden and arcade center. Activities kids may enjoy during their stay include yoga, soccer, rock climbing, stuffed animal making, fishing, kite flying, golf, tennis and more.\n\nFor those who like to shop, there are plenty of boutiques within the resort. For clothing, browse the designs at Michelle Farmer Collaborate, Alene Too, Boca Breeze, Mizner\u2019s Resort Shop, The Logo Shop, Waldorf Astoria Spa Boutique, and Egg & Friends, an upscale children\u2019s boutique. Art enthusiasts will enjoy all of the works of art on display throughout the resort, curated by Sponder Gallery. Guests can take a self-guided tour, and private tours are available upon request. All of the works of art on display are available for purchase.\n\nThere are 13 restaurants and lounges on site. At the main resort, Palm Court offers an expansive breakfast buffet, while Serendipity (a third location of the famous old-fashioned ice cream and candy shop out of Manhattan) has coffee, fresh-pressed juices and quick bites for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and even a $1,000 sundae. Choose from Japanese at Morimoto\u2019s Sushi Bar, Italian at Lucca, panoramic views from the 27th-floor The Blue, light bites and drinks at Bar Luna, or poolside tacos at Shaka Bar & Grill. The menu at Spa Cafe at the Waldorf Astoria Spa features healthy and light fare exclusively for spa guests. Mizner\u2019s Monkey Bar is dedicated to founder Addison Mizner\u2019s fascination with monkeys, and has a stellar cocktail menu. Just across from the main resort, 501 East Kitchen and Bar sits on one of the resort\u2019s golf courses and serves creative takes on American classics for lunch and dinner.\n\nFor beachfront dining, the Beach Club is just steps from the Atlantic Ocean and the pools. Get grab-and-go eats and drinks from Snack, enjoy elegant dining at SeaGrille, or try small plates and drinks served at the adjacent Ocean Bar.\n\nOf note, the resort and its restaurants and amenities are available exclusively to guests and members.\n\nBrowse through the photo gallery above for a look inside Boca Raton Resort & Club, including guest rooms, restaurants, shopping, activities, the beach and more.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2018/11/15/boca-raton-resort-club/2004420002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Keith Urban wins Entertainer of the Year at CMA's", "description": "Keith Urban won the coveted Entertainer of the Year Award for the second time at the 52nd CMA Awards.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/tv/2018/11/15/keith-urban-wins-entertainer-year-cmas/2010018002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/15/USAT/61285a0a-436a-4718-b249-3d3d3d3cb729-VPC_KEITH_URBAN_WINS_THUMB.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:16:05Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Gregory Korte and Doyle Rice, USA TODAY", "title": "Early winter weather has East Coast bracing for snow, wind and power outages", "description": "The pre-winter storm is already leaving a trail of closed schools, traffic headaches and power outages across much of the country.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/15/winter-storm-moves-midwest-east-coast-bringing-power-outages-school-closings/2009881002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/15/USAT/0644b9c4-1461-45a9-9585-d201944c4a75-AP_Massachusetts_Daily_Life.JPG?crop=5999,3359,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:16:04Z", "content": "Snow could be seen blowing past the St. Louis Gateway Arch early Thursday morning as a major winter storm is forecast to produce a swath of snow from the middle part of the Mississippi Valley to the northeast.

The freezing rain turned to ice on roads around the state, leading to a number of crashes and reports of cars sliding off roads.\n\nUp to 7 inches of snow fell in the St. Louis area on Thursday, with more continuing to fall, the weather service said. The all-time record snowfall for a single November day in St. Louis is 7.6 inches, so that mark is in jeopardy.\n\nThe weather service issued winter storm warnings from western North Carolina to northern Maine, a distance of almost 1,000 miles.\n\nLess severe winter weather advisories were also in effect from the central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic.

(Photo: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)\n\nSome six weeks after Kanye West made pro-Trump comments on \"Saturday Night Live\" and in the Oval Office, his wife, reality star Kim Kardashian says that the rapper was drawn more to the president's bold personality than his politics.\n\nIn fact, she said West is \"very not political, actually. He just happens to like Donald Trump\u2019s personality but doesn\u2019t know about the politics,\" adding, \"He will always say he was friendly with (Trump) before, and he\u2019s the same person and friendly with him now.\"\n\nSpeaking with CNN commentator Van Jones at a criminal justice reform summit sponsored by Variety and Rolling Stone, she acknowledged, \"I know it\u2019s very confusing because when you see someone wearing a red hat, you would think that they are supporting that,\" she added, \"but he\u2019s just fighting for free thought and the freedom to like a person, even if it\u2019s not the popular decision.\u201d\n\nWest's \"SNL\" and White House rants, she said, have often been \"misconstrued\" and stem from her husband's inability to publicly express political and social ideas the same way he does in private, an observation she made last month in a podcast with Jones.\n\nWhen Jones suggested Kardashian West was attempting to be \"a Kanye translator, in a way,\" the \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" star was quick to agree: \"He does need a translator, for real.\n\n\"I'm around him all the time, so I know what he talks about at home.\" The problem, she explained, comes up in public. \"I'm like, 'Wait, you just said basically the opposite of what you just showed out there.' \"\n\nBut Kardashian West also doesn't like to hector her husband in public.\n\n\u201cAfter he went to the White House or has been outspoken, I could have easily been on social media and corrected him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I believe people have their own journeys. And I know his heart, so I know that one day what he\u2019s been trying to say will come out. It\u2019s taken a little long so I\u2019m jumping in and helping him out, but I just know his heart so I never really stress too much.\u201d\n\nMore: Here's every word of Kanye West's bizarre meeting with President Trump\n\nOverall, she said, \"I think what my husband fights for \u2013 and again, he's not the best communicator at explaining it \u2013 but what he fights for is the right to like what he wants to like, even if it\u2019s different from what you like,\" Kardashian West said, clarifying the \"I Love It\" rapper's intent. \"He never said, \u2018OK, I know what\u2019s going on with immigration, and I know this and I know that.\u2019 If he really knew, he would feel very compassionate about it.\"\n\nAnd it's West's devotion to personal authenticity that his wife admires.\n\n\"As much as I won't agree with something, I do respect he's always who he is, no matter if it's popular, no matter if it's the cool thing to do. He's always himself,\" she answered when asked why she loves him.\n\n\"I might, inside, just want to be his translator all the time,\" she continued, \"but I do respect that he has his own path, and he is his own person, and he has his own opinions.\"\n\nLater, Kanye responded, tweeting that he'd like to do his own interview with Jones in the next week.

(Photo: John Raoux/AP)\n\nJabez LeBret flashed his mobile Alaska Airlines boarding pass at the agent standing outside the TSA PreCheck line at San Diego International Airport.\n\nHe didn't get very far on the late August trip.\n\n\"They stop me and say, \"Sir, you're not TSA PreCheck.''\n\nLeBret, who hadn't noticed there was no TSA PreCheck stamp on his boarding pass, was sent to the regular TSA line. Gone were the coveted PreCheck perks: a (usually) shorter line and speedier screening since members get to keep their shoes, belts and light jackets on and leave their electronics and liquids in their carry-on bag.\n\nHe didn't figure out what went wrong until he pulled out his Global Entry identification at the gate. Global Entry, a separate trusted traveler program from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, includes PreCheck benefits.\n\n\"I got my card out and realized, 'Man this is expired,''' LeBret said. \"I was shocked.''\n\nPlenty of other travelers around the country are in for a surprise, too, if they don't check the expiration date on their PreCheck or Global Entry memberships.\n\nMembership in both programs lasts five years and key anniversaries are approaching. The TSA began began selling PreCheck memberships at airports and other enrollment centers in December 2013. More than 420,000 travelers signed up in the first six months, with a total of 750,000 travelers signed up in the first year.\n\nThe agency estimates that more than 45,000 travelers' PreCheck memberships will expire between December and February alone.\n\nTSA Administrator David Pekoske doesn't think renewal will be a tough sell for most travelers. The price remains $85 for five years.\n\n\"I expect that the vast majority will re-enroll,'' he said. \"It's proven to be a very popular program.''\n\nGlobal Entry, a line-skipping option for travelers clearing customs after arriving in the United States from abroad, began in 2008 so that program is seeing its second wave of expirations this year. Global Entry memberships spiked in late 2013 when PreCheck expanded to the general public and travelers weighed which security fast pass to buy. It is $100 for five years.\n\nSeattle frequent flier Dan Shapiro signed up for Global Entry five years ago and didn't realize his membership had expired until he was stuck without PreCheck benefits for three consecutive flights this fall. At first, TSA agents told him he was probably randomly selected for the regular lane.\n\n\"After the third time, I'm like, 'This can't be right,'' said Shapiro, chief executive officer and co-founder of Glowforge, a 3D laser printer company.\n\nHe checked his account online, a process he found arduous given a new Global Entry website introduced a year ago that requires a new log in, and learned his membership expired in late September. He renewed online.\n\n\"I'm back in the fast lane,'' Shapiro said.\n\nHow to find out when your TSA PreCheck or Global Entry membership expires\n\nTSA and Global Entry officials say they notify travelers in advance of upcoming membership expiration.\n\nTSA sends notification via email or phone three months ahead of time and plans to provide six-month notice beginning early next year, according to spokeswoman Lorie Dankers.\n\nWhether you get an email or phone call depends on the preferred method of contact selected when enrolling in PreCheck.\n\nMissed an email or simply want to check your status?\n\nCheck your membership status on the TSA's website by clicking on check my service status, or call 855-347-8371 weekdays between 8 a.m. - 10 p.m. ET. TSA does not issue PreCheck ID cards. Members receive a known traveler number (KTN) to use when booking flights.\n\nGlobal Entry members receive four notices about looming expiration dates, with the first sent six months in advance and the last one 30 days out, according to Stephan Mongin, senior program manager for Custom and Border Protection's trusted traveler programs. There are also personalized notices at Global Entry kiosks beginning a year before the membership expires, he said. An email is also sent when a membership has lapsed, Mongin said.\n\nLeBret and Shapiro don't recall seeing any email notifications. Mongin said emails with a .gov address often go into a spam or trash folder.\n\nAmerican Airlines has seen a spike in the number of customers complaining about their Global Entry memberships expiring, leaving them without access to the time-saving PreCheck lanes, spokesman Ross Feinstein said.\n\nGlobal Entry makes checking the expiration date easy: it's printed on the front of Global Entry ID cards. The membership number, known as a PASS ID is printed on the back and used in flight reservations to get PreCheck access.\n\nCan't find your card? Travelers can also check their status by logging onto the CBP's Trusted Traveler website. Note that you will need to set up a Login.gov account to access your information if you haven't done so since a new system began a year ago.\n\nAn important difference between Global Entry and TSA PreCheck expiration dates: TSA PreCheck memberships expire five years from the date of issue, while Global Entry memberships expire on your birthday five years after you signed up. So if you signed up in January 2014 but your birthday is in August, you membership expires on that date in July 2019, giving you 5 1/2 years of membership.\n\nHow far in advance can I renew my TSA PreCheck or Global Entry membership?\n\nTSA PreCheck memberships can be renewed up to six months in advance online or at a an enrollment center. You need your known traveler number. Look it up online if you don't have it in your frequent flyer accounts or on a recent flight reservation.\n\nThe approval process takes two to three weeks but can come as early as a few days, the TSA says. Some members will be required to renew in person if, for example, another fingerprint scan is needed or if they changed their name and didn't update the information with the TSA. .\n\nGlobal Entry memberships are eligible for renewal up to a year in advance online or at an enrollment center. Travelers fill out the same application they did at the time of initial enrollment and may be asked to do another in-person interview.\n\nThere's an incentive to renewing Global Entry early. You can continue to use the benefits for up to six months after your expiration date while the renewal is finalized. Those who wait until after the membership lapses will not get to use the benefits until their renewal application is processed.\n\nRenewing early would have made LeBret's travel life much smoother the past few months. His renewal application is still pending. He doesn't know why but suspects it's due to heavy international travel the past five years. His wife renewed her Global Entry membership before it expired and was approved in a few weeks.\n\nWhen he had PreCheck access, LeBret, co-founder of a tuition free high school boarding school in San Diego, arrived at the airport just 35 to 40 minutes before his flight. Now he arrives 75 minutes before his flight. That might seem like a First-World problem but if you travel a lot like he does, the extra time adds up.\n\n\"Once you get a taste of the (PreCheck) convenience, it's really hard to go back,'' he said.\n\nHe said he's been \"religiously banging the drum'' to let fellow frequent fliers know not to let their Global Entry or PreCheck memberships lapse.\n\n\"Do it now. Don't wait,'' he said. \"Just get online and fill out your form.''\n\nNew to TSA PreCheck: Norwegian, Icelandic and Via Air\n\nNew to TSA PreCheck?

To help celebrate, we've done something that should earn a major award: We've rounded up 35 reasons why the holiday film about a boy who desperately wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas is still worth watching.\n\n1. \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"\n\nIt's the classic line that Ralphie hears whenever he expresses his desire for \"a Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock, and this thing which tells time.\" His mom says it. His teacher says it. Even the mall Santa says it. And now, everyone says it.\n\n2. You can even sing the movie's most famous line.\n\nThanks to \"A Christmas Story: A Musical\" on Broadway, there's now a song and tap number associated with the line.\n\n3. Yes, there was a Tony-nominated musical.\n\nAnd it was good! USA TODAY gave it three stars.\n\n4. There was also a live TV musical on Fox.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't great. We gave it one-and-a-half stars.\n\n5. Peter Billingsley, aka Ralphie, is still happy to be connected to 'A Christmas Story.'\n\nHe executive produced the Broadway musical, made a clever cameo as elf Ming Ming in \"Elf\" and was a producer on \"Four Christmases.\"\n\n6. It incorporated the F word in a PG-rated movie.\n\n\"Oh, fudge, only I didn't say fudge,\" explains Ralphie, recounting the time he accidentally muttered a cuss word when he dropped bolts for a spare tire on the side of the road. (TV's \"The Good Place\" has followed the movie's \"cursing without cursing\" example by having characters say \"mother forker\" and \"bullshirt.\")\n\n7. Ralphie took soap in his mouth like a champ.\n\nAfter cursing about the tire incident, Ralphie barely gags when he has to bite soap as his mother watches. In a voiceover, we hear about the differences in soap tastes. Then, we get a dream sequence of Ralphie going blind from soap poisoning.\n\n8. He finds a brilliantly sneaky way to share his wish list.\n\nRalphie wasn't skilled at working \"Red Ryder BB gun\" into casual conversation, but he was stealthy when it came to inserting an ad for his dream gift in his mother's magazines. Unfortunately, the subliminal message didn't take.\n\n9. You can spend the night at Ralphie's house in Cleveland.\n\nAn \"A Christmas Story\" museum can be toured in Cleveland. (Photo: LARRY E. HIGHBAUGH JR./THISISCLEVELAND.COM)\n\nThe house from the movie is open to tours and can be seen online anytime: There's a live-shot of the property. \"A Christmas Story\" museum right across the street displays props, costumes and other memorabilia.\n\n10. The leg lamp is iconic.\n\nA replica leg lamp is on display along with other memorabilia from \"A Christmas Story\" at the movie's museum in Cleveland. (Photo: MARK DUNCAN/AP)\n\nThe Old Man's surprise package has become a pop-culture icon and unofficial mascot of Cleveland.\n\n11. Now every little thing is \"a major award!\"\n\nA letter or a box in the mail? You can call it a \"major award\" or a \"major prize,\" thanks to Ralphie's dad.\n\n12. \"Fra-gee-lay. It must be Italian.\"\n\nThis quote from Ralphie's dad has forever changed the way we read package labels.\n\n13. The leg lamp inspired one of the best-ever Halloween costumes.\n\nJosh Sundquist, the motivational speaker and Paralympian who has become famous for wearing costumes that are perfect for amputees, became an Internet sensation when he dressed as the leg lamp.\n\n14. There's even a \"manly\" leg lamp.\n\nThat's thanks to Paul Jackman, who, on his YouTube channel, constructed a version of the lamp that has thicker base and boot.\n\n15. \"I triple dog-dare ya\" became law.\n\nAfter being triple dog-dared by Schwartz to lick the frozen pole, Flick did as he was dared. He licked the frozen pole and got stuck, and now none of us can back down from superlative dares.\n\n16. 'MythBusters' indeed confirmed that tongues can get stuck to frozen poles.\n\n\"When the temperature drops, cold metal can draw heat out of your tongue's saliva and freeze its water content, basically transforming your spit into a kind of superglue,\" according to the Discovery series.\n\n17. Flick's tongue was actually suctioned to the pole.\n\nScott Schwartz, who played Flick (no, he didn't play the character Schwartz; that was R.D. Robb), didn't get his tongue stuck to a cold pole. Instead, he put his tongue over the top of a tiny hole that sucked in air.\n\n18. The movie inspired cold-tongued copycats.\n\nIn this 2013 cartoon by Marc Murphy, titled \"An (Early) Christmas Story,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky gets his tongue stuck on the pole of plagiarism, as in \"A Christmas Story.\" But the media doesn't do anything about it. (Photo: MARC MURPHY/GANNETT)\n\nImprov Everywhere re-created the memorable tongue-on-flagpole scene on a subway. Many pranksters have pretended to stick their tongues on poles as a joke. Political cartoonist Marc Murphy used it to make a comment about Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, and plagiarism.\n\n19. Flick and his frozen tongue taught us a lesson in friendship.\n\nHe didn't rat his buddies out after the fire department separated him from the flagpole.\n\n20. \"Eat like a piggy!\"\n\nThanks to Ralphie's mom, we now know the genius and hilarious way to get a kid to finish his dinner. Ask him to eat like a piggy.\n\n21. Ralphie's mom is a quiet hero of the film.\n\nAs played by Melinda Dillon, Ralphie's mom knows how to get her kids to eat, whether to withhold information from her husband and when to burst into a fit of laughter. Also: Did you notice she left Ralphie's bully Scut Farkus on the ground? Savage. Which reminds us ...\n\n22. Ralphie conquered his bully.\n\nAfter Ralphie and his friends take regular beatings from Scut and Grover Dill, Ralphie finally lets Scut have it. And then Ralphie cries.\n\n23. \"The Old Man\" is loving but cranky.\n\nDarren McGavin, who died in 2006, played Ralphie's father, who is always called \"The Old Man\" in the film. He has flaws, including a temper and little patience for dinnertime, but he's a realistic dad who wants to make his family happy and is excited to get timed while he changes a spare tire. He ultimately does something for Ralphie that he knows his son will like: He gets him the Red Ryder BB gun.\n\n24. Randy is all of us preparing for winter weather.\n\nLayering is important! Sure, multiple jackets might make your arms stiff and a face scarf might make it hard to breathe, but at least you're not cold! Something Randy could've used: a nose warmer.\n\n25. That \"deranged Easter Bunny outfit.\"\n\nThat bunny onesie with the bunny slippers is ridiculous. Aunt Clara really outdid herself with that Christmas gift for Ralphie.\n\n26. It's so popular, you can even buy your own bunny onesie.\n\nIf you need some new, obnoxious loungewear, Walmart and Spirit Halloween sell versions of it. There's even a confusing dress version.\n\n27. There's 'A Christmas Story' race for a cause.\n\nHere's another good time to wear a pink bunny onesie. The annual 5K/10K is Dec. 1 in Cleveland. You can also do a \"virtual race\" anywhere.\n\n28.

They eat Christmas dinner at a Chinese restaurant, like many Jews.\n\nAs many people who don't celebrate Christmas know, Chinese restaurants tend to stay open Dec. 25, so it's a great place to have a meal that day. For the Parkers, however, eating there was a last resort because dogs ate their turkey.\n\n30. The movie features the iconic voice of Jean Shepherd.\n\nShepherd, the radio personality, narrates the movie as the elder Ralphie and wrote the book the film is based on. He died in 1999.\n\n31. Shepherd has a cameo in the film.\n\nFun fact: He plays the man who tells Ralphie and Randy to get into the back of the line to see Santa.\n\n32. The director also makes a cameo.\n\nDirector Bob Clark, who died in a car accident in 2007, has a small role as Ralphie's neighbor who's very curious about the Parker family's new leg lamp.\n\n33. The movie became a sleeper hit.\n\n\"A Christmas Story\" had a small budget and only did OK at the box office. It made about $20 million in 1983, behind forgotten movies including Richard Gere's \"Breathless\" remake and John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John's \"Two of a Kind.\"\n\n34. It's a holiday favorite on TV.\n\nTNT and TBS have aired marathons of \"A Christmas Story,\" introducing the movie to younger audiences.\n\n35. It shows an authentic family story.\n\nMany holiday films before \"A Christmas Story\" sugarcoated what life was like during the holidays. In reality, there are dark sides to Christmas: the commercialism, the stress of preparing food and gifts, the fact that usually someone is unhappy with the holiday plans. \"A Christmas Story\" brought those ideas to light, comically.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/15/christmas-story-35th-anniversary-why-its-still-love/1768856002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Guest Columnist, Glenn Harlan Reynolds, Guest Columnist", "title": "Forget the blue wave and behold the purple puddle | Opinion", "description": "Democrats in the House and Republicans in the Senate means gridlock.

USA TODAY\n\nDemocrats in the House and Republicans in the Senate means gridlock. That's a good thing, but it is only a temporary solution.\n\nIn Minneapolis on Nov. 6, 2018. (Photo: Leila Navidi/Star Tribune via AP)\n\nWell, it wasn\u2019t the huge Blue Wave we were promised, a change in Congress on a par with the Tea Party\u2019s \u201cshellacking\u201d of President Barack Obama in 2010, or President Bill Clinton\u2019s big midterm losses in 1994. It looks more like a Blue Slosh. Or maybe a Purple Puddle. The Democrats regained some ground, but it wasn\u2019t the overwhelming repudiation of President Donald Trump and the Republicans they were hoping for.\n\nAs I write this, it looks as if Democrats will control the House of Representatives by a narrow margin, while the GOP keeps control of the Senate. What does that mean? Gridlock.\n\nIs that good? It just might be.\n\nThe idea that gridlock is good is based on the notion that most of what Congress does is probably bad, and that when Congress can\u2019t do much we\u2019re better off. As Bill Kort wrote in 2017, \u201cGridlock is good because when Congress is tied up in knots they can\u2019t do anything to hurt us. This idea has been verified by the market many times over the past 25 years.\u201d\n\nGridlock in Congress can be a good thing\n\nKort notes that the economic boom of the 1990s took place after Clinton was forced to moderate his approach post-1994, and that times of government unity often lead to bad decisions. Under divided government, things have to appeal to both parties or they don\u2019t pass. That will take a lot, given how divided the parties are.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that \"divided government is the perfect time to do big things.\" Pointing to Social Security reform in 1983, the 1986 Tax Reform Act, and the Clinton-era welfare reform program, McConnell said, \u201cNone of those things in my view would have occurred in unified government.\"\n\nThere are a lot of things that need to be done, ranging from infrastructure, to trade, to a health care fix that will get us past the Obamacare debacle. They won\u2019t get addressed unless the two parties can come together. I think there\u2019s room for them to work together \u2014 and former Democratic National Committee Chair Ed Rendell was saying the same thing on election night on Fox News. It\u2019ll be interesting to see whether President Trump can bring some of his famed \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d skills into play.\n\nMore: Election results 2018: Bragging rights for everybody and nobody\n\nThe Senate is failing America. Elect Democrats to reduce acrimony, negotiate with Trump\n\nIf you want to fix the polarization crisis, use your vote to shift the political climate\n\nFor Trump, at least, there are some upsides to a Democratic-controlled House. If, as expected, the leadership consists of people like Nancy Pelosi, Jerrold Nadler, Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters, Trump will have a useful array of foils. He\u2019ll have to balance his desire to use them as convenient enemies in the run-up to 2020 and his need to work with them to produce some sort of legislative achievement.\n\nLikewise, the Democrats will have to decide whether to weaponize the House via investigations and subpoenas or to work with the president. Rendell strongly encouraged the latter, but the party\u2019s Trump-hating base will strongly favor the former. On the other hand, the Trump-hating base failed to produce the promised Blue Wave.\n\nThe federal government is too powerful\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a bigger lesson, as brought home by satire site The Babylon Bee, which wrote, \"Nation torn apart by routine election starting to wonder if government may be too powerful.\"\n\nAs the nation was torn apart by a relatively mundane, routine midterm election, just like the ones that regularly occur every four years, Americans began to wonder if a government in which such a commonplace election can impact so many lives in so many ways might just be a little bit too powerful. The nation suddenly realized that a government holding elections that threaten far-reaching changes in each and every person's private life could actually need to be downsized a tad. \"I was starting to wonder why we were all at each other's throats,\" said one Democratic voter in Oregon. \"And then it hit me: The politicians and policies we're voting on could shake up who has the government's blessings for the next few years, and which groups will get left out. And then I was like, 'Whoa. Maybe if the government weren't so huge and bloated, we wouldn't care about elections that much.' \" He then dismissed the idea as \"crazy talk,\" however.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a satire site, but is this really satire? And no, the idea isn\u2019t \u201ccrazy talk.\u201d\n\nThe outcome of national elections is such a big deal because the federal government possesses such far reaching power over people\u2019s lives. When the Constitution was drafted, James Madison told us that the powers of the federal government were \u201cfew and defined.\u201d And that was true then.\n\nIt\u2019s not true now, and people get upset over the idea of the other party in power more because they fear what the federal government might do to them than because they have hopes for what the federal government might do for them. An oversize, overreaching federal government really is tearing us apart. Gridlock is only a temporary solution to that.\n\nIf we do something to shrink the federal government, we\u2019ll likely make things better. Is that crazy talk? Maybe. But it\u2019s also true.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 It\u2019s been only a week, but Matthew Whitaker is acting nothing like a placeholder.\n\nHours after his appointment as interim attorney general following the ouster of Jeff Sessions, the former Iowa federal prosecutor played the role reserved for the Justice Department chief at the investiture of new Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nHe has weighed in on the combustible immigration debate, characterizing the southern border as \u201cin crisis.\u201d\n\nHe described a surge in hate crimes as \u201ca call to action \u2026 and we will heed that call.\u201d And he did not let the Veterans Day holiday go unrecognized, offering a public salute to the troops: \u201cThis is the land of the free because it is the home of the brave.\u201d\n\nEven as Democrats and some Republicans question his standing to hold the interim post, Whitaker is taking every opportunity \u2013 big and small \u2013 to assert his authority as if he is not going anywhere soon.\n\nWednesday, Justice officials defended President Donald Trump's authority to elevate Whitaker to the temporary post without Senate confirmation as is required of other Cabinet officials. Whitaker took the trappings of office on the road back to Iowa where he tried out his new title before a hometown audience.\n\n\"Some of you may have heard that there have been some changes at the department in recent weeks,\" Whitaker, 49, said in prepared remarks before launching into a full-throated endorsement of the Trump administration's opioid enforcement policy and support of police. \"The Trump administration will always be a law-and-order administration.\"\n\nWhitaker's very public profile since Sessions' departure last week has added to wariness about Trump's judgment in selecting a little-known surrogate to serve on an interim basis as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.\n\nThe reactions ranged from the extreme \u2013 Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del., declared Whitaker a \"clear and present danger\" to the Russia investigation headed by Justice special counsel Robert Mueller \u2013 to plain anxious.\n\n\"I have never seen this before,\" said Jimmy Gurule, who was an assistant attorney general in George H.W. Bush's administration. \"If this guy has the authority to serve temporarily, which I question, people have a right to question whether this goes beyond an ordinary caretaker role.\"\n\nEven some who support Whitaker acknowledged the unusual circumstances that brought him to office and the controversial issues that immediately confront him.\n\n\"It may not be what we are used to,\" said Mark Corallo, who was Justice spokesman under Attorney General John Ashcroft. \"A lot of what is happening now is not what we are used to. But there is nothing wrong with it. You do what you are told. If he's out on the road doing stuff and a little more out in front than what we've seen before (of an interim attorney general), it's likely because he's been told to do it. There's nothing inappropriate about it.\"\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker assured Iowans of the Trump administration's support for law enforcement. (Photo: Steve Pope)\n\nWhitaker's appointment has been a flashpoint from the moment it was announced \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 in a tweet from the president.\n\nWhitaker's public remarks criticizing Mueller's inquiry, once suggesting that funding for the investigation could be choked off, became instant fodder for concern about the fate of the special counsel's investigation, now under Whitaker's control. He made the comments during appearances on cable television and radio before he joined Justice last year as Sessions' chief of staff.\n\nUntil Whitaker's appointment, oversight of the Mueller inquiry rested with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The deputy, who selected Mueller as counsel, was placed in charge last year after Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign.\n\n\"The president is clearly dodging the Senate confirmation process, installing a political lackey at the helm of the DOJ solely to obstruct the Mueller investigation,\" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday. She said Whitaker was \"unfit\" for the job and should be recused from any involvement in the Mueller investigation.\n\nPelosi's comments were prompted by a 20-page Justice Department opinion Wednesday defending the appointment, asserting that Whitaker's senior executive status \"unquestionably\" authorized Trump's decision to elevate him even though the Senate did not confirm the designation.\n\nThe opinion, issued by Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, did not address whether Whitaker should be recused from the Russia investigation because of his comments. Nor did the document address any limits on Whitaker's authority as acting attorney general.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Whitaker, as acting attorney general, has full authority over all department operations, including sensitive prosecutions that range beyond Mueller's orbit.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., tried Wednesday to force a quick vote on legislation that would protect Mueller from being fired by Trump or Whitaker. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., objected and blocked the effort after saying the bill isn't needed because nobody has threatened to shut down the investigation.\n\nMueller's inquiry isn't the only one at stake. Federal prosecutors in Washington, New York and Pennsylvania are pursuing cases that either closely parallel the special counsel's work or were directly referred by Mueller \u2013 all of which now fall under Whitaker's oversight.\n\n\u2022 In July, Russian national Maria Butina was charged as an agent for the Kremlin in an alleged attempt to infiltrate organizations with special influence in American politics, including the National Rifle Association.\n\n\u2022 In August, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and self-described \u201cfixer,\u201d Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to charges related to paying hush money at Trump\u2019s direction to women alleging extramarital affairs with Trump. Cohen pleaded guilty to tax and bank fraud, as well as campaign violations. The U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York is handling the case, though it was referred to New York by Mueller's team.\n\nCohen has yet to be sentenced. He has cooperated with Mueller's investigators.\n\n\u2022 On the eve of Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July, a dozen Russian military intelligence officers were indicted as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. The officers engaged in a sustained hacking effort into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u2022 Three months later, Russia's military intelligence apparatus was targeted again as seven officers were charged with hacking computers associated with hundreds of athletes and anti-doping sports organizations around the world from 2014 to 2018. The charges weren\u2019t tied to Mueller\u2019s investigation, but three of the same officers were charged in both cases. The chief federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh is handling the case.\n\nEven in high-profile cases, federal prosecutors in districts beyond Washington are traditionally afforded some measure of autonomy to set their own guidelines and make charging decisions within their own offices.\n\nThere are limits.\n\n\"In Whitaker's case, the elephant in the room is the Mueller investigation,\" said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami who served as chief of the Public Integrity Unit. \"And to date, Whitaker, in his own words, has shown a bias against Mueller, even raising the prospect of taking money away from it. I think people have a right to be concerned about what happens next.\"\n\nMore: Maryland files federal court challenge asking judge to block Whitaker, install Rosenstein\n\nMore: Democrats to investigate Matthew Whitaker's role with company that allegedly bilked customers of millions\n\nMore: Who is Matthew Whitaker?

Sure, the Jaguars proved to be a tough matchup for the Steelers a year ago, but both of these teams are different in 2018.\n\nCharles: Steelers\n\nWhen does a 6-point home underdog spread seem small to you?

The Colts have figured out how to protect Andrew Luck and the defense is good enough.

Both J.J. Watt and Jadeveon Clowney have a big day and the Houston offense pulls out a late win.\n\nCharles: Texans\n\nThis one will be within a field goal. I just trust the Texans\u2019 defense to keep Adrian Peterson relatively grounded and we know Alex Smith will have his usual 250-yard day.\n\nCowboys at Falcons (-2.5)\n\nSteven: Falcons\n\nSo the Falcons let us down on the road last week, but they\u2019re a different team at home. And I\u2019m not ready to jump back on the Cowboys\u2019 bandwagon after a win over a flawed Eagles team.\n\nCharles: Cowboys\n\nI\u2019m done trusting the Falcons. They\u2019re too inconsistent in spots where they should excel. So I\u2019ll go with the Cowboys to pick apart the secondary after a huge win at Philadelphia.\n\nBuccaneers at Giants (-0.5)\n\nSteven: Buccaneers\n\nI\u2019m not crazy about betting on Rayn Fitzpatrick on the road, but Tampa Bay has more talent, and I could see a Fitzmagic day happening in the Meadowlands.\n\nCharles: Giants\n\nThe \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af game of the week. I have to back the home team against a porous Bucs defense. The Giants actually looked like a decent football team on Monday, so maybe there\u2019s a slight bit of momentum.\n\nRaiders at Cardinals (-5)\n\nSteven: Raiders\n\nI\u2019m not taking Vegas\u2019 bait here. They want you to bet on a bad Cardinals team because the Raiders have been so bad. Arizona is not good enough to it to cover a spread this big. Oakland was a little feisty against the Chargers last week.\n\nCharles: Cardinals\n\nFeels like the Raiders have quit on 2018, which is pretty scary when you consider the reported contract Jon Gruden got from Oakland\u2019s brass.\n\nBroncos at Chargers (-7.5)\n\nSteven: Broncos\n\nUgh, am I really betting on Case Keenum against Philip Rivers? I guess I am. Los Angeles looks a little shaky last week, the Broncos are coming off a bye and have played teams close all season. That line is just a little too big for me.\n\nCharles: Broncos\n\nEven if the Broncos aren\u2019t that good, they keep games closer than 7.5 points \u2014 they\u2019ve played five games that were won or lost by four points or fewer. So I\u2019ll take the points against a division rival.\n\nEagles at Saints (-9.5)\n\nSteven: Saints\n\nI\u2019m not betting against this Saints team \u2014 which is the best in the league \u2014 for the rest of the season. Unless they lose, of course. Then I\u2019ll re-adjust. Until then, ride this team.\n\nCharles: Saints\n\nThe Eagles\u2019 secondary is a nightmarish mess, which means Drew Brees could put up 50 points at home. Carson Wentz will try to keep up but he\u2019ll fall short of covering.\n\nVikings at Bears (-1.5)\n\nSteven: Vikings\n\nI\u2019m still not ready to trust Mitchell Trubisky in a big game. Not against a Mike Zimmer-coached defense. This defense is so much better with Everson Griffen healthy. Minnesota will take control of the NFC North.\n\nCharles: Bears\n\nI think Chicago\u2019s D shuts down Kirk Cousins and Mitchell Trubisky\u2019s ascension continues. The Bears are for real.\n\nChiefs at Rams (-2.5)\n\nSteven: Rams\n\nThe game of the season. Both teams are going to score 40 points, but I just have a little more trust in Aaron Donald and the Rams defense to come up with a big play late.\n\nCharles: Rams\n\nThe offenses cancel each other out, so which defense do you trust more? It\u2019s the Rams\u2019, plus they\u2019re at home and not on a badly-damaged playing surface as they were supposed to be.

The topic has taken on added urgency since May, when the Supreme Court opened up sports gambling to any states that choose to embrace it.\n\nThe NHL and NBA have recently signed agreements to provide MGM Resorts International with data for use in betting. MGM will access the data through Sportradar, which provides services to national and international sports federations, media companies and bookmakers.\n\nShared sports data and enhanced analytics allow bookmakers to set better odds, but they are also expected to lead to real-time proposition bets. Fans would be able to wager on if the next free throw will be made or missed, for instance, or whether there will be a goal on the next power play and who will score it.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see variations of that,\u201d says Jake Williams, vice president of legal and regulatory affairs for Sportradar U.S. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing derivative betting take place for the last four or five years much more expansively\u201d in international markets. \u201cSo I think that will permeate throughout the U.S. and we\u2019ll have a lot of in-play wagering, a lot of side bets and prop bets.

Republicans kept the Senate majority but lost control of the House to the Democrats. (Photo: Zach Gibson, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Celebrating a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, President Donald Trump admitted at a Rose Garden ceremony in October that he was \u201cnot at all confident\u201d the agreement could win approval in Congress.\n\nHe may have less reason for optimism following last week\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nVoters handed Democrats a majority of seats in the House for the first time in eight years, returning them to power in January and possibly complicating Trump\u2019s trade agenda, especially his efforts to win approval for the new pact with Mexico and Canada.\n\n\u201cI see it as unlikely that (Democratic leader) Nancy Pelosi is going to say, \u2018Thanks for this trade deal, President Trump, we\u2019ll just send it along,\u2019\u201d said Bryan Riley, who follows trade issues for the National Taxpayers Union.\n\nCongress isn\u2019t expected to vote on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement until sometime next year, when Democrats will be back in charge of the House.\n\nNAFTA fight ahead\n\nThough trade deals are usually subject to an up-or-down vote with no amendments, Congress still would have to pass legislation to implement the agreement. House Democrats could use that legislation as the vehicle to tweak the deal or even hold it up as leverage to extract concessions from the Trump administration on unrelated issues.\n\nAt a minimum, that is likely to slow down the approval process, trade analysts said.\n\n\u201cLook, it was always going to be hard to get this agreement passed,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican consultant who has worked with private companies to promote free trade. \u201cTrade agreements are tough even in the calmest of environments, when relations between the White House and Congress are in good working order. So given that it\u2019s a pretty chaotic time and you have a change in power in Congress, it will be very challenging.\u201d\n\nOther parts of Trump\u2019s trade agenda, such as his tariffs on Chinese imports, probably won\u2019t receive as much of a pushback from the new House majority, analysts say, because many Democrats agree with the president\u2019s protectionist policies even though they question his approach. Even Pelosi has said tariffs should be used as a leverage point to negotiate more fair and open trade for U.S. products in China.\n\nDemocrats would like, however, for lawmakers to have a say on tariffs and may pursue legislation giving Congress the right to accept or reject such levies. Similar legislation went nowhere in the current GOP-controlled Congress.\n\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, announced at the end of September after months of negotiations, will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, a nearly quarter-century old accord that essentially eliminated tariffs on most goods traded among the three countries.\n\nDuring the recent trade talks, \u201ca lot of corporate lobbyists and congressional Republicans were downright scornful of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer\u2019s efforts to engage on NAFTA renegotiation with the congressional Democrats and unions that have opposed past trade deals,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizens\u2019 Global Trade Watch.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201chis approach appears prescient: After this election, only trade deals that can earn Democratic support will get through Congress.\u201d\n\nThe new trade pact includes some policies embraced by Democrats, including stronger labor and environmental provisions. Yet critics have complained those provisions don\u2019t go far enough and are filled with too many loopholes.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, many Democrats have long opposed NAFTA and aren\u2019t inclined to back the new deal either, said Daniel Griswold, a trade expert The Mercatus Center, a non-profit think tank at George Mason University.\n\nDemocratic concerns about NAFTA\n\n\u201cThe administration went a long way to try to address Democratic concerns over NAFTA, but I think those concerns are so deep that the administration wasn\u2019t able to satisfy them,\u201d Griswold said.\n\nThe labor provisions include a requirement that, starting in 2020, at least 30 percent of cars and trucks made in North America must be built by workers earning at least $16 per hour.

The sanctions won't directly affect the crown prince.\n\n\"The Saudi officials we are sanctioning were involved in the abhorrent killing of Jamal Khashoggi,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. \"These individuals who targeted and brutally killed a journalist who resided and worked in the United States must face consequences for their actions. The Government of Saudi Arabia must take appropriate steps to end any targeting of political dissidents or journalists.\"\n\nMore: Report: Saudis discussed killing other enemies long before Khashoggi's death\n\nSaud Al-Mojeb, the kingdom's public prosecutor, said his office would seek capital punishment for five of the Saudi nationals who confessed to Khashoggi's murder.\n\nHe said the most senior official behind Khashoggi\u2019s murder in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 is Ahmad al-Assiri, a former deputy intelligence chief.\n\nAl-Assiri was arrested and fired for ordering Khashoggi's forced return to Saudi Arabia, an operation Riyadh tried to characterize as a botched rendition by rogue operatives. Al-Mojeb did not say whether Al-Assiri faces the death penalty. He said 21 people are in custody and 11 have been indicted in connection with the case.\n\nTurkey said it has audio evidence that Khashoggi\u2019s murder was sanctioned at the highest level in Saudi Arabia, probably in coordination with the Saudi crown prince, the nation\u2019s de facto ruler and a close U.S. ally.\n\nMonday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau became the first Western leader to confirm that Turkey shared this evidence with other countries\u2019 intelligence agencies. President Donald Trump acknowledged its existence but has not said whether he has heard it. The recording was shared last month with CIA Director Gina Haspel.\n\nMore: White House aide Bolton says Jamal Khashoggi audio doesn't implicate Saudi crown prince\n\nAl-Mojeb did not address the recording and requested only that Turkish authorities release additional information about their investigation. He said Khashoggi\u2019s murderers drugged and killed the writer inside the consulate before dismembering the body and handing it over for disposal by an unidentified local collaborator.\n\nAfter Al-Mojeb's remarks, Turkey released a statement urging Saudi Arabia to reveal who ordered Khashoggi's killing. It called the prosecutor's comments \"unsatisfactory\" and insisted that the suspects be extradited to Turkey for trial.\n\nKhashoggi's remains are unaccounted for more than a month after he entered the consulate to obtain legal documents needed to marry his Turkish fiancee.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he pressed the Saudis for answers over the case and told Salman in a phone call that \"the United States will hold all of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable.\" In a statement Thursday about the sanctions, Pompeo said, \"The State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts, consult Congress and work with other nations to hold accountable those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.\"\n\nIn Congress, lawmakers said the U.S. sanctions on the 17 Saudis were a good first step but called on the Trump administration to go further.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action does not put this issue to rest,\u201d said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cIt remains unclear whether the Trump Administration has determined who is responsible for this horrific incident.\u201d\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said he had \u201ca lot of concerns about the trajectory that Saudi Arabia is on right now, and I think a price needs to be paid.\u201d\n\nThree Republicans and three Democrats introduced legislation Thursday that would suspend U.S. weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and impose mandatory sanctions on individuals responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death. It would also require the Trump administration to document human rights in Saudi Arabia and impose new accountability measures for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\n\u201cThis legislation is an important way to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for various acts in Yemen as well as the death of Jamal Khashoggi,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nCLOSE Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reviewed the U.S. intelligence into what happened to missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, said the focus has to be on Saudi Arabia right now. (Oct. 11) AP\n\nHeather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s chief spokeswoman, said the administration is still gathering and reviewing evidence in Khashoggi\u2019s case and could take additional steps if warranted.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work diligently to ascertain the facts,\u201d Nauert said.\n\nNauert said the U.S. sanctions were not coordinated with the Saudi\u2019s announcement.

Trysta Krick reveals and looks at how the position is thriving at all ages in 2018. USA TODAY\n\nHow will the relocated game impact Jared Goff and the Rams? (Photo: Jake Roth, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOne fascinating matchup highlights Week 11, but there are plenty of storylines to sort through \u2014 including first place in a division totally up for grabs.\n\nHere are the key questions for Week 11.\n\n1. Who will win the midseason Super Bowl?\n\nThe Rams and Chiefs, two of the best teams and most potent offenses, square off Monday night in what could very well be a preview of Super Bowl LIII in February. Both teams are 9-1, making it just the fifth time since the 1970 merger that teams with one loss or fewer meet this late in a season. The Chiefs rank second in the NFL in scoring offense (35.3 points a game); the Rams rank third (33.5). Two of the game\u2019s top young passers in Patrick Mahomes \u2014 who ranks first in yardage (3,150) \u2014 and Jared Goff \u2014 who ranks second (3,134) \u2014 will battle for the first time in their careers. Skill position players like Todd Gurley, Tyreek Hill, and Travis Kelce figure to be big. But this game might come down to the defense that limits more explosive plays than the other. That edge might go to L.A., which has been better and is tied for ninth in the league with 26 sacks.\n\n2. Will moving Monday's game to Los Angeles affect either team?\n\nThe other storyline in this game was the NFL\u2019s decision Tuesday to relocate it from Mexico City\u2019s Estadio Azteca due to poor field conditions. Because it\u2019s scheduled as a home game for the Rams, it\u2019s being moved to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Rams had just arrived in Colorado Springs on Monday to train for the altitude they were expecting in Mexico City. The team will stay there and practice throughout the week, so even though they\u2019ll play at home Monday night, this could have a bit of an away game feel for them. For the Chiefs, not much changes other than their eventual destination \u2014 though it\u2019s more than likely that the crowd in the Coliseum will be predominantly favoring the Rams. Unless any Chiefs fans who were planning on making the trip down to Mexico City can change their travel plans, expect a lot of blue and gold.\n\n3. Will Andrew Luck get sacked?\n\nHe\u2019s having a monster, comeback campaign and a lot of credit needs to go to the Colts' offensive line. The group ranks second in the NFL with only 10 sacks allowed, one behind the Saints. This is an incredible change for a team whose line had been a perennial issue and was a big reason Luck was constantly dealing with various injuries \u2014 none bigger than a right shoulder issue. Indy ranked last (56) in the stat in 2017 and 28th (44) in 2016. Now, it\u2019s the central reason why Luck and the Colts have won three in a row. In fact, the O-line hasn\u2019t yielded a sack in four-and-a-half games, spanning 57 possessions and 187 drop backs. And while facing a Titans team Sunday that leads the league in defensive scoring (16.8 points a game) could slow Luck\u2019s production down, he might stay upright in this game, too, because Tennessee is tied for 18th in the league with 23 sacks forced this year.\n\n4. Who will be in the driver\u2019s seat in the NFC North?\n\nBecause of all the hype on the Chiefs-Rams battle, Sunday night\u2019s Vikings (5-3-1) at Bears (6-3) matchup is going mostly unnoticed. Whoever wins will sit atop the division and \u2014 for the time being \u2014 will be in the driver\u2019s seat. Granted, there will still be plenty of season left, and these two squads still have to face off in the regular-season finale in Minneapolis, so a loss for either squad won\u2019t be devastating. The Packers (4-4-1) are also well within striking distance, so at this point in the season, it\u2019s imperative for teams in tight division races to start stacking victories \u2014 especially against their division foes. If there\u2019s one team, however, who might need it more, it might be the young Bears who have so many players unfamiliar to playoff runs. They\u2019ve already won three in a row and a victory Sunday would build even more momentum headed into the final stretch.\n\n5. What impact will Bengals' coaching changes have?\n\nCincinnati\u2019s defense was bad. Historically bad. It ranks last in several key statistics. In their past three games, the Bengals had allowed 500 or more yards in each. In fact, they averaged giving up 545.3 over that span. By Monday morning, the team fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin and coach Marvin Lewis said he\u2019d take over play-calling duties. Lewis and the Bengals also announced that fired Browns coach Hue Jackson \u2014 who was the team\u2019s offensive coordinator from 2014-15 \u2014 would be joining the staff as a special assistant. Though Jackson is an offensive specialist, Lewis said in the press release announcing Jackson\u2019s signing that he would help with \u201cday-to-day responsibilities on defense, including analyzing our opponents and helping me on game days with the players and defensive coaches.\u201d The Bengals will get their first chance to show the moves were smart Sunday against a division-rival Ravens team that has lost four of their last five games.\n\n6. If called to start, how will rookie QB Lamar Jackson perform? If Joe Flacco is healthy, will he keep his job?\n\nSpeaking of the Ravens, Flacco has been battling a hip injury and was forced out of practice Wednesday. Coach John Harbaugh said Flacco would be able to play without practicing, so his status for Sunday might go until the hours leading to the game. Baltimore took Jackson with the last pick in the first round of the draft and has inserted him into games in special packages. He has completed seven of 12 throws for 87 yards and one touchdown. But it\u2019s Jackson\u2019s legs that might give Cincinnati problems, if forced to start. He has run the ball 28 times for 139 yards and one score. The Ravens obviously felt Jackson could become the eventual franchise quarterback, but if the team continues to lose, they might opt for an eventual rebuild earlier than originally planned. But, if Flacco is healthy enough to play, he won\u2019t be able to afford any slip ups.\n\n***\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

When are movie theaters, grocery stores, liquor stores, shopping malls and bakeries most crowded during the week? How can you avoid getting stuck in holiday traffic?\n\nGoogle analyzed data from Google Maps to help you manage the rush this year, and provide insight into the places you and your neighbors visit, when you visit them and when to get on (or stay off) the road.\n\nYou can consult an interactive Mapping Thanksgiving site Google has put together to find information in the state and metropolitan area where you live or travel.\n\nGoogle\u2019s \u201cchief traffic avoider\u201d at Google Maps, Genevieve Park blogged: \u201cGetting to Thanksgiving dinner is always an adventure \u2013 but an understanding of Google Maps traffic patterns can help make your ride more predictable.\u201d\n\nSome of the data won't come as much of a surprise: Between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. the day before Thanksgiving is the worst time to hit the road, but traffic clears up significantly by 6 a.m. Thanksgiving morning. You\u2019ll also want to avoid the rush again Friday or Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhere do you go on Thanksgiving according to Google Maps. (Photo: Google)\n\nGoogle, of course, wants you to rely on Google Maps and search to make your travel decisions. You can check estimated wait times in Google Maps, for instance, before you head to the grocery for the pumpkin pie you're bringing to a family dinner.\n\nAmong the various insights: Liquor store visits peak the Wednesday before Thanksgiving; heading to the movies is a popular pastime on Black Friday.\n\nWhere do you want to go on Turkey Day?\n\nGoogle also analyzed the number of times people requested directions to places they intended to visit during the holidays. Nationally on Thanksgiving Day, for example, popular spots were, in order: tree farm, outlet mall, electronics store, ATV rental service and video game store.\n\nThe next day, Black Friday, those national search results look very different: scenic overlook, place of worship, tree farm, football field, rest stop.\n\nAnd yes, search trends are represented as general categories instead of exact searches.\n\nSeparately, Google lists \"uniquely popular\" search trends, compared to the rest of the U.S. For example, in New York State on Thanksgiving Day, the top five unique searches are government office, music venue, art center, athletic field and car race track.\n\nAmazon and Whole Foods Market have Thanksgiving turkey deals. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nBy contrast, the Thanksgiving Day list in Texas consists of: cultural center, athletic field, ballroom, rodeo and off road race track.\n\nIn California it is: soccer store, cabin rental agency, beach, place of worship and mission.\n\nAnd in Florida, the listed five are: university, club, event management company, comic book store and tool store.\n\nA word about methodology: For search trends analysis, Google considered the \u201cThanksgiving Holiday Period\u201d to start the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and end on Black Friday. Trending categories are determined by comparing the total number of direction requests during the Thanksgiving period to the total number of direction requests two weeks before and two weeks after Thanksgiving week.\n\nThe categories with the highest ratio increase during Thanksgiving week are considered top trending categories. The trending categories in each state were then compared to the ratio of trending national direction requests during Thanksgiving. Categories that were searched more frequently in a state than nationally were considered \u201cuniquely popular\u201d in that state.\n\nCheck Google's mapping site for the area that interests you, and as Park referenced in her blog, to not \"be a turkey.\"\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/15/google-maps-data-may-help-you-avoid-holiday-traffic/2005913002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Niemann's bond with Thousand Oaks survivors", "description": "On the red carpet at the CMA Awards, Jerrod Niemann talks about playing the Thousand Oaks Borderline Bar and Grill before the recent shooting, while Matthew Ramsey and Danielle Bradbery discuss filming music videos in areas hit by natural disasters.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook\n\nHSA paperwork with money on top. (Photo: The Motley Fool)\n\nWhat does health care have to do with retirement? Plenty, and there's an investment vehicle out there that can help with it.\n\nHealth savings accounts could be an important option, though most people aren't thinking of them for retirement. As their name implies, these vehicles are designed to help Americans stash away cash for medical expenditures. Most people use them for near-term costs, while still employed. But medical bills also accumulate in retirement, and the money that builds up can be used to meet such costs, very efficiently.\n\nThe accounts allow for pretax contributions, tax-sheltered growth of investment dollars and tax-free withdrawals if used to pay for medical costs. They can help minimize taxes compared with taking withdrawals from other accounts, such as traditional Individual Retirement Accounts.\n\nHSAs increasingly are included in benefits packages offered by employers. They also may be opened through the government health insurance marketplaces or exchanges. Either way, HSAs are designed for people who use high-deductible health insurance plans. With open-enrollment season here, now's the time to investigate.\n\nA new study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that while more Americans are turning to HSAs to meet medical expenses, relatively few use them for retirement planning. The study also found that few people are investing their HSA funds for the long haul, and even fewer are maxing out their contributions.\n\nThe research was based on nearly 6 million HSAs with $13 billion in combined assets.\n\nLargely underutilized\n\nHSAs have been around since 2004 and thus don't have as long of a track record as IRAs, including Roths, or 401(k)-style workplace retirement plans. More than three in four HSAs were established just within the past four years, according to the institute, a research group that focuses on health, savings and retirement issues.\n\nMore Money: Keurig launches Drinkworks Home Bar, a pod-based cocktail delivery machine\n\nMore Money: 8 ways to use credit-card rewards to stay on budget during the holidays\n\nMore Money: Did PG&E cause the devastating Camp Fire? California utility's stock is plunging\n\nParticipants often use HSAs as a type of checking account, pulling out money to meet short-term health expenditures. Still, even these people typically withdraw less than they contribute, which explains how account balances continue to grow.\n\nFor accounts that received at least some contributions during 2017, the average balance rose to $2,764 at the end of the year, up from $1,873 at the start. HSA balances can be rolled over to future years.\n\nHalf of HSA owners contributed money in 2017, averaging $1,949, with employer contributions averaging $895, according to the study. But only 13 percent of individuals saved the full allowable limits.\n\nMost account holders keep their balances in cash, further underscoring the checking-account feel. Those who invested in growth vehicles such as stock mutual funds and let their money compound had higher balances on average, according to the study. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are especially good choices for small HSA balances, providing broad diversification and allowing low minimum investments.\n\nOne thing to watch are fees: A Morningstar study last year said fees can be a problem, and they might exert a greater impact on low-yielding cash instruments.\n\nPlan details\n\nPaul Fronstin, director of the health research and education program at EBRI and author of the group's study, cited the need for employers and others to help participants recognize the long-term investing potential of HSAs and the wisdom of socking away more money.\n\n\"With health care costs comprising such a large percentage of retirement expenses, the HSA should be viewed as an important retirement savings vehicle,\" he said.\n\nThe accounts are flexible and portable, meaning you can move them among various investment firms. Aside from cash options, mutual funds are common choices, he said.\n\n\"For most people, they'll look like their 401(k) plans,\" Fronstin said, referring to the investment choices available.\n\nFor 2018, an individual could sock away up to $3,450 in an HSA, or $6,900 for family coverage, with people 55 and older able to invest another $1,000. Unlike IRAs, there's no income eligibility with HSAs. In 2019, the investment limits will rise to $3,500 and $7,000, respectively.\n\n\"Now, practically all investments found in an IRA or retirement plan are available in an HSA,\" Columbia Threadneedle said in a paper. The investment firm considers HSAs an \"ideal\" vehicle not just for current health needs but for those incurred in retirement.\n\nRetiree health estimates\n\nMost people will incur substantial health costs in retirement, for which HSAs can help.\n\nThe Center for Retirement Research at Boston College this year estimated a typical 65-year-old couple would need roughly $197,000 for health care spending in retirement. The EBRI itself assumed a 65-year-old couple would need $265,000, while Fidelity Investments projected that a couple, also starting at age 65, would need around $280,000. None of those estimates included potential costs for long-term care.\n\nThe Vanguard Group, with help from Mercer Health & Benefits, took a different tack, projecting a typical woman could face $200,000 in out-of-pocket medical costs starting at age 65 and extending over her remaining estimated lifespan of 24 years. The costs are roughly 2 percent less for men, partly because they tend not to live as long.\n\nBut that report mostly focused on these costs as an annual expense, not as a lump sum, for which the yearly costs would be closer to $5,200 per person. The point wasn't to minimize the amount of money retirees might need but to portray the challenge in smaller, more manageable chunks.\n\nThe Vanguard/Mercer study noted that HSAs can help fill the gap and can be used as \"retirement savings and investing vehicles rather than as a 'checking account.' \"\n\nValue of HSA withdrawals\n\nA key point here is to start using and funding HSAs now, while contributing close to the annual limits if you can.\n\nA related suggestion is not to tap the accounts too early. Workers who elect to pay current medical expenses from regular income can allow money in their HSAs to accumulate. As noted, the money would build up and withdrawals would come out tax-free if used for eligible medical costs, the definition of which is pretty broad.\n\nThat last point, on tax-free withdrawals, deserves elaboration. Because money pulled from HSAs during retirement avoids taxes, unlike that from traditional IRAs, it wouldn't cause problems if you already have started to claim Social Security retirement benefits.\n\nSocial Security benefits could be partly taxable if you have a significant amount of other income. Job earnings, pension withdrawals and traditional-IRA distributions are among the income sources that could trigger taxes but not those from Roth IRAs or HSAs.\n\nReach Wiles at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8616.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/2018/11/15/health-savings-accounts-retirement/1998093002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Opinion contributor, Jeb Bush, Opinion contributor", "title": "Jeb Bush has advice for new governors: Ignore DC's 'gridlock, dysfunction and arrogance'", "description": "Governors have power to innovate, drive the conversation and to problem solve, and I believe governors can have the most impact on education.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/15/midterm-election-governors-education-reform-congress-gridlock-jeb-bush-column/1999425002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/14/USAT/d8ea32ba-2a1a-4974-84c2-9dbc0e19a59e-XXX_CP_Teacher_Project_2018_Corpus_Christi_02.JPG?crop=2999,1679,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T11:00:04Z", "content": "In Sinton, Texas, on Sept. 17, 2018.

(Photo: Kevin K. McAleen/Corpus Christi Caller-Times/USA TODAY Network)\n\nCongratulations to the 36 new and incumbent governors elected this month. You campaigned hard, made your case to voters and won.\n\nNow what?\n\nAs you navigate policy and politics in the coming months, understand that the one constant in today\u2019s tumultuous and polarized political environment is the pathetic state of affairs in Washington.\n\nWashington is not just our nation\u2019s capital, it is the capital of gridlock, dysfunction, arrogance and antics. In short, there is a tremendous amount of talk, but little real action. With a divided Congress on the horizon, matters will only get worse.\n\nSo, here\u2019s my advice to our nation\u2019s governors: lead, don\u2019t follow. Exploit the 10th Amendment wisely gifted to us by our founders.\n\nThe role of governors is key in this current era of disruption and volatility. Governors have the power to reform, to innovate, to convene, to drive the conversation and to problem solve. They balance budgets, work across the aisle and are far more responsible for outcomes and accountable to their constituents than their federal counterparts are.\n\nGovernors can make a difference in education\n\nI believe Governors can be most impactful \u2014 immediately and for generations to come \u2014 by focusing on education. A quality education is the great equalizer in our society, holding the power to break the cycle of poverty and despair for millions of Americans.\n\nRight now, only one-third of America\u2019s fourth- and eighth-grade students are reading at grade level. In the most recent worldwide rankings of nations\u2019 average scores in math, science and reading, the United States ranks 31st. And while more employers need workers with strong math skills, the latest ACT data shows that just 40 percent of graduates who took the exam were ready for college.\n\nIn the face of these challenges, I remain optimistic because states, not the federal government, are the great laboratories of democracy and innovation. So, I urge you to challenge the status quo at every turn.\n\nStart with rewarding and retaining America\u2019s great teachers. Pay the teachers with the toughest jobs and most in-demand skills more, and rethink certification policies to make it easier to recruit talented professionals into the classroom. There is no bigger factor in the success of a student than the quality of his or her teacher.\n\nEnsure every child learns how to read. If they can\u2019t, hold them back in third grade \u2014 a critical transition year \u2014 until they can. Kids who don\u2019t learn how to read before they enter fourth grade have very little chance at thriving in life.\n\nMore: Midterm elections: Governors represent the best of bipartisan progress across America\n\nIf you want to fix the polarization crisis, use your vote to shift the political climate\n\nGovernors: We need bipartisan criminal justice reform to improve lives and our workforce\n\nRethink school accountability. The point of testing is to assess the progress of students and use the data to reward success and reverse failure. The point is not to distract from learning, and good testing policies don\u2019t. Measure what you care about and utilize technology to get the results back to teachers quickly, so the data can inform their instruction.\n\nFocus funding on students and incentivize the outcomes you want. Funding should be determined by the needs of students, not the desires of entrenched special interests. Low-income students and students who have special needs or are English learners often need additional support, so organize your system around ensuring they get it.\n\nFor the first time ever, job openings in the U.S. topped 7 million, due in large part to a lack of qualified workers. Technology has rapidly changed the demands on our labor force, and unless our education system can keep up, America will be left behind by our global competitors. We must make high school more relevant to a student\u2019s future by tying coursework directly to preparation for college or a rewarding career. Let\u2019s also end the stigma on career and technical education and instead embrace the opportunity to better meet workforce needs.\n\nEvery student should get a head start on college\n\nEvery student should be able to earn college credit in high school. Expanding access to Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, Cambridge and dual enrollment courses and college-credit aligned industry credential programs accelerates the path to higher education. There is no excuse for not providing every student with the opportunity to get a head start on college.\n\nThe future of education lies not in the 20th century model that saw a classroom of students tackling the same coursework in the same period of time, year after year, but in empowering teachers to ensure each child masters the skills necessary to advance to the next level. Embracing a menu of blended and personalized learning models will ensure students truly master the skills and knowledge expected of them throughout their K\u201312 education.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, remember that education is not a \u201cone size fits all\u201d endeavor. Empower families to find the best match for their children, whether through public school choice, charter schools or private school choice, including vouchers, tax credit scholarships and education scholarship accounts. The families who benefit the most from greater choices are the low-income and working-class families who currently have no other alternatives.\n\nThere are just a few ideas, and there are thousands more that will be generated by you and your colleagues, guided by the experiences and needs of your citizens, in the coming months and years.\n\nI hope you embrace the challenge of transforming America\u2019s education system because there is no greater responsibility our leaders have than to preserve our nation\u2019s future. Just remember, go big, be bold and don\u2019t wait on Washington!\n\nJeb Bush served as the 43rd Governor of Florida and is the founder and chairman of the Foundation for Excellence in Education.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Like most unsubstantiated claims leveled by President Donald Trump, his allegations of fraud in the high-stakes recount in Florida\u2019s Senate and gubernatorial elections started with a tweet.\n\nShortly after polls closed on last week's midterm election, the president warned of a \u201cbig corruption scandal\u201d in Florida as officials struggled to tally votes in Broward County. Days later, he referenced \u201cmassively infected\u201d ballots and accused Democrats of trying to \u201cfalsify\u201d his 2016 win in the Sunshine State, without citing evidence.\n\nTrump went further Wednesday, suggesting that voters were using disguises to cast multiple ballots.\n\n\u201cWhen people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles,\" Trump told the Daily Caller in an interview. \"Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It\u2019s really a disgrace what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested there was rampant voter fraud because of what he described as a lax approach to verifying identification.\n\n\u201cIf you buy a box of cereal \u2013 you have a voter ID,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe assertions were only the latest conspiracy theory embraced by Trump over the Florida gubernatorial and Senate elections as election officials raced to tally votes.\n\nThe machine recount of some 8 million votes cast in the races ended at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time Thursday after a federal judge in Florida declined a request by Incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and his allies to push the deadline back so more votes could be counted. Nelson is trailing Republican Rick Scott by about 13,000 votes.\n\nExperts who study the use of conspiracy theories in politics say the ongoing recounts in Florida have all the preconditions needed to fuel Trump\u2019s decades-old penchant for embracing claims of subterfuge. The outcome is uncertain, the drama is high and the complexity of the issue makes it hard for voters to separate fact from fiction.\n\n\u201cIt fits the pattern of everything he\u2019s done so far,\u201d said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami who has written on the issue. \u201cThe underlying message of all of Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories is that the \u2018elites\u2019 sold out the interests of the American people.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s use of conspiracy theories to rile up voters and shift the media\u2019s attention is by now a well-known element of his communications strategy. He gained national prominence by questioning the citizenship of President Barack Obama. During his 2016 campaign he accused Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s father of associating with President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassin. He flirted with the notion that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in his sleep in early 2016, may have been murdered.\n\nAll of those claims were baseless.\n\nWhen will Bill Nelson concede in Florida? The characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes, too much spotlight on them now! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2018\n\nAfter winning the election, Trump explained his second-place finish in the popular vote by claiming millions of illegal ballots were cast for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump appointed a commission to investigate voter fraud, which never presented formal findings nor evidence to support his claim. Trump disbanded the group in January.\n\nIn the run-up to the midterm, Trump said that a caravan of Central Americans inching through Mexico toward the U.S. border included criminals and \"unknown Middle Easterners.\" His administration never backed up the claim.\n\nIn theorizing about the razor-thin margin in the Florida governor and Senate races, Trump is returning to an issue \u2013 and a state \u2013 that has befuddled many Americans since the contested 2000 presidential race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. The election was decided by the Supreme Court after a recount in Florida.\n\nElection officials were once again racing to wrap up a statewide recount amid a flurry of lawsuits filed by candidates from both parties.\n\nAn email reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK showed a Democratic party leader in Florida encouraged volunteers to send altered election forms to voters in an effort to fix ballot signature problems. Though it\u2019s not clear that any of those requests were accepted, election experts said the revelation is likely to raise new questions about the vote-counting process.\n\nMore: Email shows Florida Democratic official sought to use altered forms for reaching voters with ballot problems\n\nInitial results put Scott ahead of Nelson in the state\u2019s Senate race and indicated Republican Ron DeSantis had a healthy lead over Democrat Andrew Gillum in the state\u2019s contest for governor. Those margins have shrunk, however, as election officials count outstanding ballots.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have zeroed in on Broward County, which has struggled to meet state-imposed deadlines to post up-to-the-hour tallies of the count. They also point to a ruling against Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes that found she violated state law by destroying ballots too quickly after the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cWhen they call this woman incompetent, they\u2019re wrong,\u201d Trump told The Daily Caller. \u201cShe\u2019s very competent but in a bad way.\u201d\n\nThough the issues Trump and others have raised have sparked bipartisan concern, there is no evidence Snipes or other officials are tampering with the outcome of the election. Democrats have suggested the problems have more to do with outdated voting machines and underfunded election offices.\n\nExperts said the Florida recount is fertile ground for conspiracy theorists.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ca perfect situation on which such theories can rest,\u201d said Joanne Miller, a political scientist at the University of Delaware who has studied the issue. High uncertainty and high anxiety, she said, are among the factors that can cause people to believe unsubstantiated claims.\n\n\u201cThere's also another aspect of elections that makes them ripe for conspiracy theories: The inherent competition surrounding an election, and therefore the stakes of the outcome, are high,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cIt's more self-esteem protective to believe that an election outcome was due to fraud than to believe, for example, that it was due to the fact that the other party had policy positions that resonated better,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump, of course, is not the first president or high-profile figure to hold such theories. Then-first lady Hillary Clinton referred to what she described as a \u201cvast, right-wing conspiracy\u201d to explain the impeachment of her husband, President Bill Clinton, in 1998.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon harbored theories that Washington insiders were out to end his presidency.\n\nBut Trump is unusual in his embrace of conspiracies and his desire to share them with supporters, experts said. Both the frequency and the extent of the claims Trump makes without offering evidence make him unique in his use of them, they said.\n\nThose who have studied the president for years \u2013 including before his political debut \u2013 note that his approach, even in business, is to keep foes and friends alike off kilter and uncertain of his motives.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a salesman,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer. \u201cThe only way it works is if people keep watching.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/15/donald-trump-pushes-conspiracy-theories-florida-recount/1991767002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Government offers to help Milan-Cortina bid for 2026 Games", "description": "Enjoying its status as the leading contender to host the 2026 Winter Olympics, the Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo bid has received another boost with a funding promise from the Italian government", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2018/11/15/government-offers-to-help-milan-cortina-bid-for-2026-games/38532755/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a978ce4278f3d95cafd2a3b6889585fac70360d0/c=164-0-4237-2291/local/-/media/2018/11/15/USATODAY/usatsports/aa91d681447148d59ea8ed4a8c1e762a.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:22:20Z", "content": "FILE - In this Feb. 10, 2018, file photo, a worker grooms the snow after installing a set of Olympic Rings on the ski jump hill at the 2018 Winter Olympics at the Alpensia Ski Jumping Center in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nROME (AP) \u2014 Enjoying its status as the leading contender to host the 2026 Winter Olympics, the Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo bid has received another boost with a funding promise from the Italian government.\n\nInterior Minister Matteo Salvini said if \"private funding isn't enough, we'll make the final push\" to cover the remaining costs.\n\nSalvini's announcement signals a shift after Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio said last month the government would send a letter of support for the bid to the International Olympic Committee \"but as government we won't provide 1 euro \u2014 neither for direct nor indirect costs.\"\n\nSo far, the candidacy is being financed exclusively by the regional governments of Lombardy and Veneto \u2014 two of Italy's most affluent regions.\n\n\"We hope that resources arrive from the government, too,\" Cortina Mayor Gian Pietro Ghedina said Thursday. \"Even if the business community in Veneto and Lombardy is quite robust.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the other two candidates on the IOC's shortlist for 2026 are facing problems .\n\nCalgary's bid was rebuffed on Tuesday when local voters said \"no\" in a nonbinding referendum, while a newly formed government in Stockholm has announced it would not provide funding to host the games.\n\n\"We've done well to move forward,\" Italian Olympic Committee president Giovanni Malago said. \"Otherwise we would have lost a chance that seems more unique than rare.\"\n\nAdded Veneto president Luca Zaia: \"It would be a mistake to lower our guard now that there is possibly one less opponent, because we won't win it until the day it's assigned by the IOC.\"\n\nThe host will be selected by the IOC in a vote on June 24 in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nThe Milan-Cortina candidacy is operating on a budget of between 2 and 3 million euros ($2.3 and $3.4 million) but could scale back if Stockholm were also to withdraw.\n\n\"If we end up alone I won't cry,\" Milan mayor Giuseppe Sala said, adding that his city is ready for the games after hosting the Expo 2015 World Fair. \"Big events are a great opportunity. You need to handle them well and we've already shown here that we know how to do that.\"\n\nThere are no plans for a referendum involving the Milan-Cortina bid, which takes advantage of IOC reforms by proposing to host the games over a wide swath of northern Italy.\n\nThe candidacy would entail holding skating sports and hockey in Milan and Alpine skiing and sliding events in 1956 host Cortina, which is already preparing to hold the 2021 skiing world championships.\n\nOther snow sports like snowboarding and freestyle skiing could be contested in Bormio and Livigno north of Milan.\n\nSeveral events would also be slated for existing venues in Trentino-Aldige, which would mean involving a third region.\n\nBiathlon could be held at Anterselva near Cortina, Nordic sports in Val di Fiemme and long-track speedskating in Baselga di Pine.\n\nThe opening ceremony would be at the 80,000-seat San Siro in Milan, ensuring one of the biggest crowds in history for a Winter Games kickoff.\n\nAnd in a nod to Italy's large trove of cultural and historic sites, the closing ceremony could be at Verona Arena, a large Roman amphitheater that has hosted the Opera on Ice.\n\n\"I've seen the plan and it's one that will have some of the least economic impact in history because it utilizes a lot of existing (venues),\" Salvini said in an interview with Leggo.it on Wednesday.\n\nOne potential hurdle for the Italian bid rose recently when the ruling coalition led by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and right-wing League party suggested it is considering taking over the distribution of financial funding for sports from the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI).\n\nUnder current conditions, CONI decides how to divide the more than 400 million euros ($450 million) in annual funding from the government between the various national sports federations. If the function is removed, it would greatly reduce CONI's power.\n\nHowever, Italy is anxious to bring a bid through the entire process after two Rome candidacies for the Summer Games were withdrawn in recent years because of financial concerns.\n\n\"If we look at how some Olympic cities have ended up there's not much to be happy about,\" Salvini said. \"But I prefer to look at the positive side.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Veuer's Angeli Kakade has the story. Buzz60\n\nGas prices are falling as oil drops. (Photo: SbytovaMN / iStock)\n\nGas prices are plunging as the Thanksgiving holiday travel period approaches.\n\nA dramatic drop in oil prices over the last several weeks is fueling the decline.\n\nGas prices neared a four-year high in October, when they briefly topped $2.90 per gallon, but have since retreated.\n\nAmple global supplies of petroleum, which is refined into gasoline, have played a key role in delivering savings for consumers.\n\n\"Thanksgiving gas prices are getting carved up at a time of year when we\u2019re all used to getting the turkey ready,\" said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at fuel-finding app GasBuddy. \"This is a fairly dramatic turnaround.\"\n\nThe national average was $2.65 per gallon on Friday, down 7 cents from a week earlier and 23 cents from a month earlier, according to AAA. Prices are still up 9 cents from a year ago.\n\nBelow $2\n\nSeveral dozen stations across Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas were charging less than $2 per gallon as of Wednesday, according to GasBuddy.\n\nThat number \"could be several hundred by Thanksgiving Day,\" GasBuddy's DeHaan said.\n\nMore than 54 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles for Thanksgiving, according to AAA. That's up 4.8 percent from 2017 and marks a 13-year high.\n\nMore Money: Higher mortgage rates and unsettled stock market scare off potential homebuyers\n\nMore Money: Cord cutting accelerates even worse than first thought, with 1.2 million defections in Q3\n\nMore Money: Keurig launches Drinkworks Home Bar, a pod-based cocktail delivery machine\n\nDeHaan predicted that national prices could average somewhere in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 by Thanksgiving.\n\nOil's recent collapse is a big reason why. U.S. crude prices on Wednesday afternoon were trading in the range of $56.50, down about $20 per barrel from their 2018 high set in early October.\n\n\"The scale of the sell-off in oil has been bewildering,\" Mizuho Securities managing director Paul Sankey said in a research note.\n\nAmple supplies\n\nOne key factor was the Trump administration's decision to extend waivers to Iran on certain oil exports despite the reimposition of other sanctions amid a dispute over a nuclear deal. That has led to higher-than-expected Iranian petroleum output.\n\nMeanwhile, strong output by U.S. oil producers and other countries has kept supplies humming. Production from Russia, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. is at record levels, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nOther factors include declining global demand. Investors believe the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may cut production in a bid to prop up prices, but anticipating that relief hasn't helped boost prices.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/15/thanksgiving-gas-prices/1998466002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Opinion contributors, Cynthia Lee, Opinion contributors", "title": "Jemel Roberson's avoidable death: Reform deadly force laws, require police to de-escalate", "description": "State laws should require police de-escalation.

That could have saved uniformed security guard Jemel Roberson from being shot and killed by an officer.\n\nJemel Roberson and Tristan Roberson (Photo: Avontea Boose via AP)\n\nThe death of security guard Jemel Roberson is yet another in a long string of fatal police shootings of young black men. Why did the officer see Roberson as a threat even though he was trying to help the police? The officer saw a young black man with a gun and assumed Roberson was a dangerous criminal. Decades of social science research indicate that most people associate blacks with danger, criminality and violence.\n\nWhat happened? On Nov. 11, 2018, a little after 4 a.m., a police officer responding to a report of gunfire at a suburban bar shot and killed 26-year-old Jemel Roberson, a security guard at that bar. Roberson had just captured a man with a gun following a shooting at the bar, which is why police were called.\n\nWhen police arrived on the scene, Roberson was outside the bar, holding one of the suspects in the shooting on the ground with his knee in the man\u2019s back and his gun pointed at the man\u2019s back. According to a spokesperson for the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Roberson was licensed to carry a firearm. He was in uniform and was wearing a hat with the word \u201cSecurity\u201d on the front. The officer shot Roberson even though many people around were screaming at him that Roberson was a security guard.\n\nDe-escalation could have saved Roberson's life\n\nRoberson\u2019s death could have been avoided had the officer engaged in de-escalation measures, such as taking cover, waiting for backup, and trying to talk with Roberson before deciding to shoot. If a law had been in place requiring de-escalation, this officer might not have been so quick to pull the trigger.\n\nAvoiding fatal police shootings of individuals who are not actually dangerous criminals posing an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury is the reason legislatures need to reform state laws on police use of deadly force. Most statutes currently in place focus solely on whether the officer believed deadly force was necessary to effectuate an arrest or prevent the escape of a felon or to protect against a threat to officer or public safety.\n\nMore: Chicago's policing problem is systemic. Truth and reconciliation are needed.\n\nMore: When videotaping cops isn't enough, what's next?\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nWhen an officer claims justifiable use of deadly force, his or her use of force should be evaluated on two levels. First, was the officer\u2019s belief in the need to use deadly force to protect against a threat of death or serious bodily injury honest and reasonable? And second, were the officer\u2019s actions reasonable?\n\nFocusing on actions as well as beliefs is very important for several reasons. If the focus is solely on the officer\u2019s beliefs, the question becomes simply whether the officer\u2019s fear was reasonable. Given the difficult job police officers do, it is too easy to conclude that an officer\u2019s fear was reasonable.\n\nActions mean more than beliefs and fears\n\nIf the focus is on actions as well as beliefs, however, the fact finder can get beyond an assessment of the officer\u2019s fear. In assessing the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s actions, the fact finder should consider whether the officer engaged in de-escalation measures and whether the conduct of the officer prior to the use of deadly force increased the risk of a deadly confrontation.\n\nGiven the absence of legislation requiring de-escalation measures, fatal police shootings of civilians trying to help police are likely to occur with more frequency in the future \u2014 especially if there is follow through on President Donald Trump's call for teachers and other civilians to carry firearms. Roberson's death is a warning we should not ignore.\n\nCynthia Lee, a professor of criminal law at The George Washington University, is the author of \"Reforming the Law on Police Use of Deadly Force: De-escalation, Preseizure Conduct, and Imperfect Self-Defense.\"\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

(Photo: Tim Loehrke/USA TODAY)\n\nIn 2014 I first wrote here about the issue of incredibly shrinking aircraft accommodations with \u201cThink airline seats have gotten smaller? They have.\u201d Using archived data, I detailed how both legroom (as measured in seat pitch) and comfort (as measured in seat width) have both been steadily decreasing since the 1980s. In the four years since that column was widely disseminated, conditions have only gotten worse.\n\nTherefore the recent headlines declaring that Congress had addressed airborne seat shrinkage seemed like welcome news. But the underlying issues are much more complex. And it\u2019s way too soon to celebrate more legroom in an industry that is actively squeezing us into increasingly cramped quarters.\n\nMore: Senate approves bill that would regulate airline seat sizes\n\nGood news/bad news\n\nTighter seats eventually caught the attention of one group of frequent flyers poised to do something about it: members of Congress. Thus H.R. 1467, the Safe Egress in Air Travel (SEAT) Act, began making its way through the legislature two years ago. Eventually it generated support from both parties and in both houses of Congress, and last month it was included in the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act signed by President Trump.\n\nWhen the bill became law, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a co-sponsor, declared victory by stating, \u201cSafety must never take a backseat, much less a shrunken seat, to profits.\u201d Numerous articles have been written suggesting the FAA will now clamp down on airlines cramming more seats into cabins.\n\nFor the record, on behalf of Consumers Union I publicly supported the SEAT Act in testimony before the House Transportation Committee last year, in articles, and in public statements such as this: \u201cThe bill establishes minimum dimensions for airline cabin passenger seats, which is important for passenger health and safety, as well as comfort.\u201d\n\nThe comfort issue is obvious for anyone who has flown in economy class in recent years, particularly in middle seats. But tight seats also are a health issue due to the threat of clotting and deep vein thrombosis. And of course there\u2019s a safety consideration, since packed seating can make emergency egress more difficult.\n\nInch by inch\n\nAmong U.S. airlines, differences still remain in economy-class seating standards. JetBlue, for example, offers 34-inch pitch in coach on its Airbus A320, and that\u2019s without having to pay for \u201cEven More Space\u201d seats. On the other end of the \u201couch scale,\u201d critics have long pointed to Spirit Airlines, the ultra low-cost carrier offering a knee-busting pitch of just 28 inches. But other domestic airlines aren\u2019t much better these days. In fact, Spirit\u2019s seat width of 17.75 inches actually measures up well against the Big Three of American, Delta and United.\n\nLast month, in asking \u201cIs Amtrak becoming like the airlines?\u201d I noted the economy/coach sections of the Big Three had shrunk to just 30 to 31 inches in seat pitch, and 16.6 to 17.8 inches in width on Boeing 737s, workhorses for domestic service. This compares with 1985, when Consumer Reports found the tightest pitch on some airplanes in domestic service was 32 to 34 inches, and most aircraft offered much more legroom.\n\nThat Congressional hearing I referenced above took place on May 2, 2017; the very next day, headlines blared that American (and possibly United) was considering reducing legroom by up to 2 inches in the economy sections of its Boeing 737 MAX jets, creating pitch of just 30 inches, and even 29 inches in some seats. That news indeed came to pass, at least partially: According to both American and SeatGuru, the airline\u2019s 737 MAX currently offers 30 inches in Main Cabin economy class.\n\nAnd the expansion of domestic basic economy classes, which recently spread from the Big Three to JetBlue and Alaska, means domestic airlines are certainly not eager to increase seat comfort on their own \u2013 despite the negative implications for comfort, health and safety.\n\nMore: Basic economy: What it's like in airlines' cheapest seats\n\nSafety questions\n\nBack in March I addressed this critical safety issue with \u201cIs it time to update airplane evacuation tests?\u201d I pointed out the FAA\u2019s \u201c90-second rule\u201d for evacuating commercial aircraft has been in place since 1967, but hasn\u2019t been updated in 51 years in response to an array of factors, including the introduction of widebody, twin-aisle airplanes; record-high passenger loads; record numbers of carry-on bags due to ubiquitous checked baggage fees; and average Americans becoming both taller and heavier. And of course, tighter airplane seats.\n\nSo far these arguments haven\u2019t swayed the government agency charged with protecting flyers. In July, Bart Jansen noted here that an FAA official stated there is \u201cno evidence\u201d seat dimensions \u201champer the speed of passenger evacuation, or that increasing passenger size creates an evacuation issue.\u201d This isn\u2019t heartening news for consumers, particularly since in December 2017 this same U.S. Department of Transportation \u2013 which oversees the FAA \u2013 shut down without prior notice all public comments on a series of consumer issues the airline industry had criticized.\n\nPaul Hudson, president of FlyersRights.org, recently stated: \u201cUnless the FAA changes its current position that existing shrunken seats are safe, that there are no significant adverse health effects, that it has no jurisdiction to regulate seats due to health effects anyway and that any matter of comfort is none of its business, there will likely be no change. The FAA could even set seat size standards so low that it encourages further shrinkage.\u201d\n\nOthers share such cynicism, including travel columnist Joe Brancatelli: \u201cThe FAA is the same agency that approved existing seats with as little as 28 inches of legroom. What makes you think they\u2019d become consumer-friendly now? And do you really think they\u2019d force airlines to rip seats out of planes?\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s a two-front war for advocates concerned about the safety issue: convincing the FAA to re-evaluate existing seat standards, and not to allow even further seat shrinkage.\n\nAdvice for booking seats\n\nWhat follows are some key reminders for passengers concerned about the seats they book.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no shortage of sites offering advice on how to secure the best airline seats for those concerned about tight quarters. But note that policies vary widely by airline.\n\n\u2022 Unassigned seating. On airlines with unassigned \u201copen\u201d seating \u2013 such as Southwest \u2013 the key is to prioritize your boarding; if you don\u2019t automatically qualify for early boarding (frequent-flyer elites, handicapped, families with children, military, etc.) then options include purchasing upgraded boarding. Checking in early \u2013 up to 24 hours in advance \u2013 will help, but isn\u2019t a guarantee for prioritized boarding.\n\nMore: Is that seat taken? Southwest Airlines seat-savers drive some passengers crazy\n\n\u2022 Assigned seating. With most airlines, the best strategy for securing seats is to book early and select in advance. But remember that some airlines may not show all available seats during booking in an attempt to \u201cupsell\u201d you to premium seats at a higher cost. For those not in premium classes or ineligible for priority boarding, booking early and checking in early are key. But beware you may be forced to pay more, since many booking systems are now designed this way.\n\n\u2022 Many airlines provide seat pitch and width dimensions on their websites; some also include seat maps and info on Wi-Fi, entertainment, amenities, etc. These include American, Delta and United.\n\n\u2022 For comparison purposes, check out the seat maps section on SeatGuru. The site provides detailed data that many airlines don\u2019t, including locations of lavatories, galleys and exits.\n\n\u2022 An important reminder: Within a given aircraft model, such as the Boeing 737, there can be numerous series, variants, types and sub-types. For example, SeatGuru provides six different seat maps for Delta\u2019s Boeing 757s and six for Delta\u2019s Boeing 767s. Pay particular attention to variant numbers (e.g., 757-200 vs. 757-300) and designations such as \u201c-ER,\u201d which indicate aircraft primarily used for extended range overwater and long-haul flights, often with different seating configurations. Some differences might seem subtle, but they can be significant if they affect your specific row or seat.\n\n\u2022 Another important reminder: Even if you find the exact iteration of the aircraft scheduled to operate your flight, remember that airlines reserve the right to switch out airplanes \u2013 dubbed \u201csubstitution of equipment\u201d in their Contracts of Carriage \u2013 at any time, for multiple reasons. (This shouldn\u2019t be confused with airline \u201cchange of gauge\u201d practices, in which two different types of airplanes operate separate legs under the same flight number.) Consider this disclaimer from United\u2019s contract, that \u201cirregular operations\u201d may include the following: \u201cSubstitution of aircraft type that provides different classes of service or different seat configurations.\u201d This gives context for last month\u2019s incident when a United flight from Chicago to Chattanooga experienced an aircraft swap and then turned back midair, generating the headline: \u201cUnited pilot to passengers: We\u2019re turning around because our plane\u2019s too big.\u201d\n\nCongress made it clear the FAA needs to set and enforce more sensible seating standards. The coming months will determine if that mandate will be heeded.\n\nBill McGee, a contributing editor to Consumer Reports and the former editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, is an FAA-licensed aircraft dispatcher who worked in airline operations and management for several years.

(Photo: AP)\n\nLONDON \u2013 British Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to secure her country an orderly withdrawal from the European Union were dealt a major blow Thursday with the abrupt resignation of Dominic Raab, the minister responsible for negotiating Brexit.\n\nHis resignation comes just hours after May won the support of her bitterly divided Cabinet for a draft deal to leave the EU after months of stalled talks and setbacks that have threatened the messy divorce known as Brexit as well as May's leadership.\n\nBut May had to make big concessions to the EU to achieve the deal. Britain, for example, will remain tied to the bloc's customs union for a transition period. The deal also prevents a \"hard border\" returning between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom and has helped ensure peace there.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Raab, Britain's Brexit secretary, said he could not \"in good conscience\" support the deal because it \"presents a very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom.\" The British pound fell 1% against the dollar on the news.\n\nBritain's Work and Pensions Secretary Ether McVey also resigned over the draft deal, as did several parliamentary aides and a junior minister for Northern Ireland.\n\nMay is already facing an uphill struggle to convince enough lawmakers in Parliament to accept the agreement with the EU before it is scheduled to depart the bloc in March.\n\nBritain's leader secured the backing of her Cabinet for the deal after an \"impassioned\" five-hour debate on Wednesday. \"I firmly believe, with my head and my heart that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom,\" she said, referring to the support from her Cabinet as a \"collective agreement.\"\n\nAddressing lawmakers on Thursday, May insisted that she had taken \"the right choices, not the easy ones\" on Brexit.\n\nYet while securing Cabinet approval was an important step for May, the deal still needs approval from the EU at a summit in the next few weeks. Then May will need to win backing from Britain's Parliament, where pro-Brexit and pro-EU legislators alike are threatening to oppose it. Thursday's Cabinet-level resignations add to the pressure and British media have suggested that a move to oust May from power is conceivable.\n\nPro-Brexit lawmakers in May\u2019s divided Conservative Party are angry over the draft agreement because they believe it will leave Britain tethered to the EU after it departs the bloc. \"I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made,\" Raab said in his resignation letter.\n\nMcVey, the jobs minister, said in her letter it is \"no good trying to pretend to (voters) this deal honors the result of the referendum when it is obvious to everyone that it doesn\u2019t.\"\n\nBritain voted to leave the EU by 52 percent to 48 percent in the vote. Some polling data indicate that if there were a second Brexit vote a majority would chose to stay in the EU. May has repeatedly rejected the idea of holding a second vote.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/15/britains-top-brexit-negotiator-dominic-raab-resigns/2009759002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Mattis: Bells' return to help US-Philippine ties", "description": "Three war-trophy bells seized by U.S. troops over a century ago got a send-off back to the Philippines on Wednesday by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis, who called the controversial decision to repatriate them an important gesture of friendship between the\u2026", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/15/mattis:-bells'-return-help-us-philippine-ties/38532725/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5967282654001_5967275527001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:38:50Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Weightlifting record-holder Lin banned 8 years for doping", "description": "A former world record-holding weightlifter has been banned for eight years in a doping case which caused confusion at the 2016 Olympics", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2018/11/15/weightlifting-record-holder-lin-banned-8-years-for-doping/38532719/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:15:21Z", "content": "LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) A former world record-holding weightlifter has been banned for eight years in a doping case which caused confusion at the 2016 Olympics.

(AP Photo/Adrian Kraus) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThings to watch in the Atlantic Coast Conference in Week 12:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nNo. 12 Syracuse vs. No. 3 Notre Dame. Coach Dino Babers' Orange (8-2, 5-2, No. 12 CFP) have been the surprise story of the season in the ACC, making a case for a New Year's Six bowl berth after being picked in the preseason to finish last in the Atlantic Division. With QB Eric Dungey leading the league's second-highest-scoring offense (44.4 ppg), Syracuse will head to Yankee Stadium trying to knock the Fighting Irish (10-0) out of College Football Playoff position.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nPittsburgh's rushing offense vs. Wake Forest's run defense. The Panthers (6-4, 5-1) are riding their ground game to the brink of an ACC Championship Game berth, averaging nearly 257 yards rushing to rank second in the league behind Georgia Tech's trademark triple option. A win will send Pitt to Charlotte for the title game . The Demon Deacons (5-5, 2-4) and their rejuvenated defense held North Carolina State to 47 yards rushing in a 27-23 upset of the 22nd-ranked Wolfpack.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nSome ACC schools keep coming up with big plays. Clemson leads the nation with 18 plays from scrimmage that have gone for at least 50 yards, while Pittsburgh is tied for third with 14 of them \u2014 including Qadree Ollison's 97-yard touchdown run last week against Virginia Tech. Duke has 11 of those 50-yarders, including a 68-yard run for QB Daniel Jones and a 52-yard touchdown pass from Jones to Chris Taylor in last week's win over North Carolina.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nVirginia will need an upset of Georgia Tech \u2014 and some help \u2014 to remain in contention in the Coastal Division. The Cavaliers (7-3, 4-2) are 6\u00bd-point underdogs in Atlanta against a Yellow Jackets team that has found its stride. The key, as it is in every Georgia Tech game, comes down to stopping the run. Coach Paul Johnson's team leads the FBS with an average of 362.4 yards rushing while Virginia has the league's fourth-best run defense, allowing 136 yards per game.\n\nIMPACT PLAYER\n\nN.C. State receiver Kelvin Harmon is coming off a record-tying performance and has a chance to break that mark at Louisville this week. Harmon's 15 catches against Wake Forest matched the school's single-game record and is the most of any power-conference player this season. The Cardinals' defense ranks last in the ACC in yards per pass attempt (8.3 ypa) and the big question mark is how they'll play now that coach Bobby Petrino has been fired.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He had two tons of gold coins in his possession. Ghasemi was his accomplice.\n\nIranians have stocked up on gold coins and other safe-haven investments as the local rial currency has plummeted in the wake of Trump\u2019s May withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. The Iranian rial has plunged to approximately 135,000 to the dollar from last year\u2019s rate of around 40,500.\n\nIranian authorities have tried to stabilize currency prices by introducing a single official dollar exchange rate, but that has not stopped a parallel black-market rate.\n\nThe U.S. clampdown that restricts Iran's access to the international banking system and limits its ability to export products from its lucrative energy industry will trigger an economic recession in the nation next year, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Spiraling living costs have occasionally led to protests.\n\nAmnesty International said that dozens of other people have also been sentenced to prison terms after convictions on similar charges faced by Mazloumin and Ghasemi.\n\nIt said Iran uses special courts that are unfair because defendants are denied access to lawyers and the right to appeal. \"With these abhorrent executions the Iranian authorities have flagrantly violated international law and once again displayed their shameless disregard for the right to life,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei established the special courts to deal with crimes involving suspected financial corruption in August.\n\n\"Spreading corruption on Earth\" is the highest crime under Iran's Islamic laws and it carries a mandatory death sentence.

(AP Photo/Todd Kirkland) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHere are a few things to watch during Week 12 of the Southeastern Conference football season:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nMissouri at Tennessee: Consider it a statement on the dreadful nature of this week's SEC slate that our top game involves two unranked teams. A victory Saturday would make Tennessee (5-5, 2-4 SEC) bowl eligible, a giant step forward for a team that went winless in SEC competition last season. Missouri quarterback Drew Lock has 11,342 career yards passing and needs to throw for just 187 yards to overtake former Georgia quarterback David Greene and move into second place on the SEC's all-time list.\n\nTOP MATCHUP\n\nTexas A&M quarterback Kellen Mond vs. UAB's pass rush: The Blazers have recorded a school-record 38 sacks to match Northern Illinois for the highest total of any Football Bowl Subdivision team. UAB's defense is also good at the right times, leading the country in third-down defense and fourth-down defense. Opponents are converting first downs on only 24.2 percent of their third-down attempts. Texas A&M has lost two of its last three games, though the Aggies bounced back with a 38-24 win over Mississippi last weekend. Mond threw for three TDs and ran for another score in the Ole Miss game.\n\nNUMBERS GAME\n\nNo. 1 Alabama (No. 1 College Football Playoff) has 24 straight home wins to match a school record previously set from 1971-74. Alabama will try to earn a 25th straight home win Saturday against The Citadel. ... No. 15 Florida (No. 13 CFP) has rallied from at least 17 points down in victories over Vanderbilt and South Carolina. The only other SEC teams over the past 15 seasons to have multiple 17-point comebacks in the same year are Auburn in 2000, Arkansas in 2011 and Tennessee in 2016. ... No. 20 Kentucky (No. 17 CFP) hasn't scored more than 17 points in a game since September. ... No. 5 Georgia's D'Andre Swift has run for a touchdown of at least 77 yards in each of his last two games. He's the first Georgia player since Herschel Walker in 1980 to have two touchdown runs of at least 75 yards in the same season. ... Texas A&M's Braden Mann is averaging 50.95 yards per punt attempt, which puts him on pace to break the NCAA single-season record for anyone with at least 36 punts. The record is currently held by Chad Kessler, who averaged 50.3 yards per punt for LSU in 1997. ... Ole Miss' A.J. Brown went over the 1,000-yard mark in receiving last week in a loss to Texas A&M. Brown is the first Ole Miss player ever to have two 1,000-yard receiving seasons.\n\nUPSET WATCH\n\nTennessee is coming off a 24-7 victory over a ranked Kentucky team but is still a 6-point underdog at home against Missouri. Tennessee needs one more win to become bowl eligible, while Missouri's already bowl eligible. ... Mississippi State is a 21-point favorite at home over Arkansas. The 25th-ranked Bulldogs (No. 21 CFP) are coming off a 24-0 loss to top-ranked Alabama. Arkansas is winless in the SEC, but played No. 10 LSU (No. 7 CFP) close last weekend before falling 24-17.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER\n\nVanderbilt's Ke'Shawn Vaughn has rushed for 354 yards and four touchdowns over his last two games. Vaughn ran for 172 yards and three touchdowns in a victory over Arkansas, and the Illinois transfer followed that up by rushing for 182 yards and one touchdown on just 15 carries in a 33-28 loss to Missouri. Vaughn next faces an Ole Miss team that is allowing the most yards rushing per game (215.6) and yards per carry (4.94) of any SEC team.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Steve Megargee in Knoxville, Tennessee, and David Brandt in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He showed his speed and dexterity when he took a blocked shot by center Matt Haarms by his own foul line, raced up court, split two Mountaineer defenders and switched hands on the way up for a layup.\n\nEdwards didn't let up at halftime with the Boilermakers ahead by double digits, nailing a high-arching straightaway three about 4 feet beyond the line.\n\n\"We're just going to try and continue to play ball,\" Edwards said. \"Getting some easy stops helps the offense get in transition.\"\n\nJustin Forrest topped the Mountaineers (1-2) with 14 points.\n\nDavidson 57, Wichita State 53\n\nDavidson's Gudmundsson, a 6-foot-4 junior, surpassed his previous high of 24 points last accomplished in a January against George Mason.\n\nHe looked like an unstoppable one-man show down the stretch. He tied the game at 50-all with a three-point play, the broke that tie with under a minute to go with a 3-pointer. Gudmundsson closed things out with four foul shots.\n\nGudmundsson, from Iceland, played nationally for his country and has always been a player teammates have looked for. \"So I'm comfortable in that,\" he said.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) \u2014 Russia will allow an international delegation to inspect its shuttered drug-testing lab this month, World Anti-Doping Agency president Craig Reedie said Thursday.\n\nThe visit is part of a deal between WADA and the Russian government which allowed the country's anti-doping agency to be reinstated in September, following a suspension of almost three years because of widespread drug use and cover-ups.\n\nThe September deal gave Russia a deadline of Dec. 31 to provide full data from the lab, which has been closed since 2015. That could help WADA ban athletes for past doping violations. Russia must also hand over samples from the lab for reanalysis by June 30.\n\n\"We have an absolutely written guarantee that this will happen from the authorities in Russia and they have accepted the date of Dec. 31,\" Reedie said. \"I find it almost inconceivable to believe that we don't complete this project in time.\"\n\nRussian authorities had been slow to agree on conditions, but Reedie said he received a letter from Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov hours before Thursday's meeting.\n\n\"We will be sending a team of highly qualified experts. Everybody knows what they've been asked to provide. The experts will deliver it and I'm perfectly confident that we have the right people going in,\" Reedie said. \"This will resolve the situation we have with the Russian authorities.\"\n\nThe first visit \u2014 which isn't expected to recover the data \u2014 will involve three \"independent people\" and \"the Russians will also have some people,\" Jonathan Taylor, who leads WADA's compliance committee, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"A full technical mission\" will follow up to gather information, Reedie said.\n\nEmails from the laboratory revealed in a WADA investigation showed that it routinely covered up doping by top Russian athletes. It's not clear what any retesting of stored samples could accomplish, since staff allegedly destroyed more than 1,400 samples in 2015 to obstruct WADA's investigations.\n\nRussian law enforcement has sealed off the lab for its own investigation, which so far has focused on accusing former lab director and WADA informant Grigory Rodchenkov of lying about doping on the country's Olympic team and of tricking clean athletes into taking banned substances.\n\nThe Russian sports minister said he reached an agreement with WADA for lab access and added he was in contact with law enforcement.\n\n\"We will fulfill our obligations to the full regarding allowing them into the laboratory,\" Kolobkov said in a statement.\n\nThe Russian anti-doping agency, known as RUSADA, could be suspended again if the government misses the Dec. 31 deadline.\n\n\"We really hope that the process of accessing the sealed-off data has exited deadlock,\" RUSADA chief executive Yuri Ganus told the Tass state news agency.\n\nWADA said its board also approved the creation of an \"independent ethics board,\" a development which follows a dispute over alleged bullying at a meeting in September.\n\nIt is not yet clear how the new ethics board would differ from the existing Ethics Panel's advisory role, or if it could discipline WADA officials.\n\n\"There are some details to work out on that in the coming weeks,\" Fitzgerald told the AP.\n\nAlso, Nigeria's national drug-testing agency has been declared non-compliant by WADA.\n\nAccording to WADA statistics, the Nigerian National Anti-Doping Committee registered only 30 samples tested last year, one of the smallest numbers of any large country.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Time, right now, is Jimmy Butler's best friend.\n\nThat's all that the Philadelphia 76ers and their newest player need. They will figure things out, figure out who goes where and who does what in every situation. In time, they'll be able to get back to their usual arsenal of plays and sets, a repertoire they had to pare down considerably for Butler's debut with his new club.\n\nThere were promising moments Wednesday night. There were also some moments of confusion, some mistakes at the absolute wrong times. In the end, it all added up to Philadelphia losing Butler's debut with the 76ers \u2014 Orlando beating them 111-106 in a game where Philly led by 16 in the fourth quarter before the Magic ripped off a 21-0 run.\n\nPatience is required when an NBA team makes a move of this magnitude, and Butler knows that.\n\n\"How tough will it be? Nah, it's not hard at all,\" Butler said after scoring 14 points. \"So far we all get along. I think that's the first thing \u2014 we all want each other to be great. We're all talking about where we're supposed to be and what we see out there on the floor.\n\n\"I'm telling you, it's coming sooner rather than later. We're going to be just fine.\"\n\nThat wasn't the case Wednesday. Butler, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons \u2014 the NBA's newest incarnation of a Big Three \u2014 shot a combined 1 for 9 in the fourth quarter, the big lead slipped away and the game was soon gone.\n\n\"You're disappointed to lose with it Jimmy's first game,\" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. \"But there are a lot of good things you can see that can happen.\"\n\nThis has been a whirlwind for the four-time All-Star. Butler was traded Monday to the 76ers by Minnesota, flew to Orlando on Tuesday and went to a team dinner that night. His first and only practice was the shootaround session Wednesday morning. Butler met with Brown to go over things, got 1-on-1 advice from JJ Redick before leaving with a basic understanding of what the 76ers wanted to run.\n\nThey didn't lose because Butler was confused, because he wasn't. They didn't lose because they dumbed-down the gameplan, either. Orlando got hot at the precise moment that Philadelphia went cold, and that just happens.\n\nBut even in a losing locker room, Philly's players knew they had just seen flashes of potential.\n\n\"Having a guy like that, somebody who's going to push everybody, he's going to help a lot,\" Simmons said.\n\nPhilly was an Eastern Conference contender before Butler got there, and having him only further legitimizes those hopes. The 76ers now are about to play seven of their next nine games at home, with the first eight of those games against clubs either at or below .500 right now. It's not exactly a daunting stretch of games, which is perfect for the 76ers as they try to figure out what works best for the new guy.\n\nHe's not worried.\n\n\"It's going to be easy to play with those guys,\" Butler said.\n\nAnd if there's a team that knows how to value taking time, it's Philadelphia. \"The Process\" was a grind of loss after dizzying loss and it lasted years. The 76ers were a laughingstock, a punch line, and they stuck to their convictions because they believed it would work.\n\nNow, they're an East favorite, a legit title hopeful.\n\n\"The life that we have lived in Philadelphia from being 1-30 to now,\" Brown said. \"Think about that.\"\n\nHe sounds like he's speaking of a faraway time, but it isn't.\n\nThe 76ers woke up on Christmas in 2015 with a 1-30 record. They had losing streaks of 12, 12, 13 and 18 games that season alone on their way to the Rock Bottom that was 10-72. The year before, they started 0-17. Here's how atrociously and historically bad they were: Even after going 52-30 last season, even if they go 66-0 the rest of this season and if they go 82-0 next season, Brown would still have a career record below .500.\n\nThere's pressure now. The burden of expectation.\n\nBrown knows it all exists, but doesn't seem to mind.\n\n\"It's going to take time,\" Brown said, then repeated those words. \"It's going to take time.\"\n\nThe biggest question is how much time Philadelphia is going to need before it figures everything out.\n\n\"When we put this thing together,\" Butler said, \"we're going to be tough.\"\n\n___\n\nTim Reynolds is a national basketball writer for The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 A new nickname for Brook Lopez started floating around Twitter after the Milwaukee Bucks 7-footer had a career night from the 3-point line.\n\n\"Splash Mountain .\" How appropriate for a self-described Disney aficionado who is quickly developing a reputation as one of the best-shooting big men in the NBA.\n\n\"I'm pretty partial to that honestly,\" Lopez said with a laugh about the moniker this week. \"I'm a pretty big Disney geek ... I wear it with pride on my sleeve.\"\n\nKeep shooting the way he did on Sunday against the Nuggets and he might challenge the \"Splash Brothers\" in Golden State for 3-point supremacy.\n\nLopez hit a career-best eight 3s and scored 28 points to help the Bucks beat Denver to split a four-game Western Conference road trip.\n\nThis wasn't just a one-night-only performance, either.\n\nEntering the Bucks' game on Wednesday night against Memphis, Lopez was tied for seventh in the league in made 3s (39) and was 14th in attempts (93), shooting 41.9 percent from behind the arc.\n\nA career 34 3-pooint shooter, Lopez said he had hoped coming into his first season in Milwaukee was to eclipse 40 percent.\n\n\"Not necessarily that I'm going in worrying about makes or misses, but that's a personal goal,\" Lopez said. \"You have to go in with a mindset, just if you're open you're going to shoot your shot.\"\n\nIt's a remarkable goal when considering just how far Lopez has come along as a 3-point shooter in such a short period of time.\n\nThe 11-year veteran spent his first nine NBA seasons with the Nets after being drafted 10th overall in the first round out of Stanford in the 2008 draft. But he didn't hit his first 3 until Jan. 10, 2015 , when he was 1 for 2 in a 98-93 loss to the Detroit Pistons.\n\nIt was the only 3 he would hit that season. He made just two the following season.\n\nThe transformation happened before the 2016-17 season, when Kenny Atkinson became head coach after serving as assistant under then-Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer.\n\n\"At the time, it was kind of the system that we ran in Brooklyn,\" Lopez recounted in explaining why he took up the 3. \"It was something he wanted to implement, and he had great confidence that I could do it.\"\n\nLopez said he was already comfortable hitting mid-range and long jumpers in game situations. Spotting up from behind the arc was something he did in pickup games with friends growing up, but he didn't have the confidence to shoot 3s in games.\n\nSo he put in a lot of work on his shot before the 2016-17 season, working out in team drills where they would practice five-out looks. Personal workouts were devoted to shooting 3s.\n\n\"It was a step just from shooting them, and my practice and workouts, and shooting them in games,\" Lopez said. \"You just have to confidence to shoot them in games.\"\n\nLopez was 3 of 31 combined from 3-point territory over his first eight seasons. He was 134 for 387 (34.6 percent) in 2016-17.\n\nLopez moved on to the Lakers last season, when he was 112 of 325 from 3 (34.5 percent). He's well on pace to shatter that his career bests in just 13 games with the Bucks .\n\nMilwaukee is undergoing its own transformation with Budenholzer now coaching of the team. He has instituted a similar system Taking Milwaukee that stresses proper spacing and taking good shots. If a 3 isn't there, All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo can be unstoppable driving to the lane.\n\nIf defenses collapse on Antetokounmpo, he can find open shooters on the perimeter like Lopez.\n\n\"You talk to old coaches, old teammates, front-office people that have been around Brook, you almost have to ask him to get off the court\" in practice, Budenholzer said.\n\nAppropriately, Lopez took some extra time after practice, shooting 3s with guards Tony Snell and Pat Connaughton before finally wrapping up.\n\n\"So the way that he's grown his game and become just a really effective 3-point shooter, a really effective player, that takes work,\" Budenholzer said. \"And I think we're all reaping the benefit of that.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

If he keeps it up, Ertz will finish with 133 catches and 1,402 yards.

Peyton Manning is first with 539. Tom Brady has 505. Brees also completed 22 of 25 passes (88 percent) in New Orleans' 51-14 win at Cincinnati. His 77.3 completion percentage this season is better than his record-setting mark of 72 percent last year.\n\nMORE ACCURACY: Five quarterbacks have a completion percentage over 70 percent: Brees, Kirk Cousins (71.3), Derek Carr (71.3), Matt Ryan (71.1) and Wentz (71.0). It had happened only nine times previously in NFL history.\n\nCAPTAIN ANDREW: Andrew Luck has at least three TD passes in six consecutive games for the Colts. Only Brady and Peyton Manning had a similar streak. Brady reached 10 games in 2007 and Manning did it in eight straight in 2004.\n\nIMPRESSIVE QBS: Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger (158.3), Cleveland's Baker Mayfield (151.2), Brees (150.4) and Chicago's Mitchell Trubisky (148.6) had a passer rating over 145 (minimum 20 attempts) in Week 10, surpassing the previous high of three done four times previously.\n\nMORE MAHOMES: Patrick Mahomes broke Len Dawson's Chiefs single-season record by throwing his NFL-leading 31st TD pass in only his 10th game.\n\nTB12 MILESTONE: Brady played his 300th game, including playoffs. He's second behind Favre, who played in 326 games.\n\nROOKIE'S RUN: Nick Chubb's 92-yard touchdown run in Cleveland's win over Atlanta was the longest rushing TD in franchise history and the second-longest by a rookie in NFL history.

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDURHAM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Drake has already been spotted wearing Zion Williamson's high school jersey.\n\nLet that be proof: Duke's season is just starting, and the Blue Devils' freshmen have already arrived.\n\nJust three games into their college careers, the youngsters have made top-ranked Duke the top story in college basketball. But Williamson said it's not all about the freshmen.\n\n\"This is a team, and there are other players \u2014 there are upperclassmen, and they lead us, because they've been through this,\" said the 6-foot-7, 285-pound Williamson who wows fans with his athletic ability and acrobatic dunks. \"We can sit here and say we know what away games will be like, but we really don't until we experience it.\"\n\nEveryone seems to want to take that journey with them.\n\nIt's early, but the youngsters are becoming a must-see phenomenon while their highlights take social media by storm and even their pregame layup lines draw oohs and aahs.\n\n\"They're so much more than just highlight plays and dunks,\" co-captain Jack White said. \"These guys are great basketball players.\"\n\nIt all started, of course, with that season-opening 118-84 rout of then-No. 2 Kentucky, turning the Champions Classic into their personal and collective showcase.\n\nA group that showed up on campus as the consensus No. 1 recruiting class in the nation has done nothing to disprove that evaluation. Tre Jones, at 6-2, runs the point. The 6-8 Cameron Reddish spots up for 3-pointers. Then there's 6-7 RJ Barrett, the top-rated player in the class, does a little bit of everything. And Williamson runs the floor and finishes strong at the rim \u2014 often dazzling the crowd in the process.\n\n\"As long as we play unselfish and play together,\" Reddish said, \"we're pretty good.\"\n\nAccording to Duke officials, the team's Instagram videos during the first week of the season were viewed more than 2 million times \u2014 more than fellow blueblood programs Kentucky (412,000) and North Carolina (172,000).\n\nThe highlights kept coming throughout an 84-46 beatdown of Eastern Michigan on Wednesday night.\n\nOne in particular \u2014 perhaps Williamson's signature dunk , at least so far \u2014 stood out.\n\nReddish lofted an alley-oop pass that at first seemed headed for the Duke pep band. Williamson leaped so high to grab it that his armpits and eyes were level with the rim, and he slammed it home. By that point, Williamson had more dunks (four) than Eastern Michigan had field goals (three).\n\nWilliamson acknowledged that he even surprises himself sometimes.\n\nIn the locker room after Wednesday night's game, he broke into a hearty laugh when teammate Joey Baker pulled out his cellphone to show a photo proving that Williamson did, in fact, soar to eye-level with the rim.\n\n\"I wanted to get super-hyped,\" he quipped, \"but I had to get back on defense.\"\n\nHaving one-and-done players roll through the program has become commonplace in recent years \u2014 Duke replaced four one-year players from last season with this group \u2014 and Barrett and Williamson are popular projections as the first two picks in next June's NBA draft. Both of them have scored at least 20 points in all three games.\n\nNor is Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski a stranger to the spotlight that always glares on the Duke program he's led to five national championships.\n\nBut college stardom is a new experience for these freshmen, and what Krzyzewski has described as \"exceptional noise\" surrounding the team became exponentially louder after the 34-point rout of Kentucky \u2014 now arguably no longer the capital of one-and-done.\n\nIn the days after that victory, Scott paid the freshmen a visit , and they learned to come to grips with just how their accomplishments resonated throughout the sport. Reddish said that putting the Kentucky win in the past and moving on was \"definitely tough\" but that \"we can't dwell on any win.\n\n\"We've got to keep getting better every day,\" he added.\n\nIf that happens, it may be impossible to drown out that \"exceptional noise.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Steve Pope)\n\nIn our system, public service is a public trust. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker will injure that public trust if allowed to oversee vital investigations he has publicly undermined \u2014 and where he has an apparent disqualifying relationship with a key witness. That is why our watchdog group has filed a demand with the Justice Department that Whitaker be recused from these matters under applicable ethics rules.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been implicated in two related FBI investigations which are overseen by Justice. There is evidence he may have personally obstructed justice, and hisfamily and circle are implicated in a bevy of other potential crimes. And the man Trump has appointed to run the agency tasked with ascertaining his culpability is a longtime political supporter best known for appearing on CNN to vociferously defend the very conduct now under scrutinyin three investigations:\n\n\u25baSpecial counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of any links and coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign\n\n\u25baThe U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York's investigation of campaign finance and other possible offenses involving the president\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, the Trump Organization, and the Trump Campaign and Trump himself.\n\n\u25baThe over-arching investigation into whether the president obstructed justice throughout the course of these or other investigations.\n\nWhitaker laid out plan to halt Mueller probe\n\nAll of this will now be controlled by Matthew Whitaker, who haslikened the special counsel to a \u201clynch mob.\u201d\n\nNever before has a president appointed an acting attorney general who is on record describing how the president could curtail an ongoing investigation of the president\u2019s conduct. In a July 26, 2017 appearance on CNN, Mr. Whitaker discussed ways to undermine the special counsel investigation, including by putting pressure on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (overseeing Mueller) to cut Mueller's budget. Indeed, Whitaker also imagined a scenario that strikingly resembles the one now before us:\u201cI could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment and that attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nApplicable law mandates recusal under these circumstances. Justice Department and prosecutorial jobs are unique because of the power they confer and the high standards of independence and impartiality that come with them. As such, prosecutors are supposed to be above the political and personal hurly-burly of the White House or Congress. To that end, Justice Department regulations require recusal from a criminal investigationif a department official has a political or personal relationship with a person or organization that is \u201csubstantially involved\u201d or has a \u201cspecific and substantial interest\u201d in a criminal investigation.\n\nMore:Here are 5 reasons why Matthew Whitaker isn't attorney general material\n\nTrump political protection plan is replace Sessions with Mueller saboteur\n\nWhitaker's Supreme Court positions are incoherent, may cause constitutional crisis\n\nIn addition to his association with Trump, Whitaker reportedly also has a personal and political relationship with Sam Clovis, the former chief policy adviser and national co-chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign \u2014 and a key witness in the Russia investigation. Of particular note, Clovis told Reuters last week that Whitaker served as a \u201csounding board\u201d for issues related to the Trump campaign while Clovis was working on the campaign. If Whitaker did indeed counsel Clovis about campaign-related issues that are now the subject of investigation, Whitaker has a political relationship that disqualifies him from supervising investigations that implicate the Trump campaign.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s personal relationship with Clovis stretches to when Whitaker served as the chairman of Clovis\u2019 unsuccessful 2014 campaign for Iowa State Treasurer. Clovis also reportedly has \u201ckept up\u201d with Whitaker and told the Washington Post that he texted Whitaker congratulations when he became acting attorney general. Clovis played a significant role as a witness to key events under investigation by the special counsel. For example, he has been reported in court documents to have been the Trump \u201ccampaign supervisor\u201d who responded \u201cgreat work\u201d to George Papadopoulos when briefed about his meeting with a Russian official and woman introduced as \u201cPutin\u2019s niece.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Standards of Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch impose fundamental duties on Whitaker to \u201cact impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual\u201d and to avoid even the appearance of a violation. Whitaker should also recuse from the special counsel and Southern District of New York investigations because the statements he has made about the investigation raise significant questions regarding his impartiality \u2014 including statements about the specific conduct under investigation.\n\nFulfill oath to serve Constitution, not Trump\n\nFor example, in a May 10, 2017 op-ed in The Hill, Whitaker defended the president\u2019s firing of then-FBI Director James Comey. In the same piece, Whitaker opposed the appointment of a special counsel to take over the investigation. In a July 10, 2017 appearance on CNN, Whitakerdefended Trump campaignofficials or a decision that is at the center of the special counsel\u2019s investigation of possible coordination between the campaign and Russia.\n\n\"You would always take the meeting,\" Whitaker said of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort took with Russians who had promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. As a political candidate, he added, \u201cyou certainly want to have any advantage, any legal advantage you can, and one of those main advantages is to know what your opponent is either, you know, I mean all sorts of things that could be happening \u2014 Hillary Clinton, there was so much smoke around her.\"\n\nWhitaker\u2019s background and public musings suggest he will be less than independent in his judgments. His recusal must be swift and public. He needs to make clear that he will fulfill his oath to serve the Constitution rather than the personal agenda of the president. Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on the integrity of these investigations, and requests for Whitaker's predecessor to join him in these assaults, demand nothing less than the unequivocal assurance that Whitaker will play no part in undermining the rule of law that he is now sworn to uphold.\n\nNoah Bookbinder is the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

He is the only son of former Olympic table tennis players An Jae-hyeong and Jiao Zhimin, who won medals for South Korea and China, respectively, at the Seoul Olympics in 1988.\n\nBut due to his big stature, he was never likely to be agile enough at his parents' sport.\n\n\"I wasn't that quick and (my parents) saw that I wasn't good enough to play table tennis, but (golf) turned out pretty good,\" An said.\n\nBrandt Snedeker shot 74 while fellow American Brendan Steele took a 9 on the par-5 11th.

Hopefully we got a little bit of our mojo back.\"\n\nFleury, meanwhile, earned his 412th career victory while sporting a pair of brand new gold pads.\n\n\"A little bit more flashy than my other ones,\" Fleury said about his pads, which generated more conversation than his 51st shutout that moved him into a tie with four others for 24th all-time. \"I just thought, we're the Golden Knights, might as well try a little golden gear and have a little swagger out there.\"\n\nIt was the second straight home shutout for the Golden Knights and Fleury, who struggled during the team's recent 1-3 road trip. Going 1-2 in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, the 15-year veteran allowed 10 goals.\n\n\"I feel sometimes when it doesn't go well, for goalies, you want to do too much instead of just being patient and relax and reacting,\" Fleury said. \"They're a team that throws the puck at the net, but they always have lots of guys around the net. But this is the best place to play. It's so loud, the atmosphere here every night is awesome.\"\n\nIt marked the second time the Golden Knights and Fleury defeated their Pacific Division rival at home this season.\n\n\"Obviously, Flower made some key saves, but I thought we had some great jump the second period, it was an excellent period for us,\" Gallant said. \"We got a few puck lucks tonight, we got some breaks tonight finally. Hopefully it's gonna turn for us.\"\n\nJohn Gibson started for Anaheim and gave up three goals on 12 shots before being pulled at 7:19 of the second period. Ryan Miller came on and stopped 11 of the 13 shots he faced.\n\nThe Ducks came into their second meeting with Vegas this season after limiting opponents to two goals or fewer in 10 games but couldn't keep the Golden Knights' second line in check as Tuch, Eakin and Pacioretty each had two points.\n\nAfter spending a majority of last season on the third line, Eakin has been a welcome addition to the second line, back alongside Tuch, now that Erik Haula is on the injured reserve list.\n\n\"When Cody came up, I thought we had interesting chemistry,\" said Tuch, who has a point in his last four games, and in seven of the 11 games he's played in after missing the first eight games. \"Cody and I played together from the start of the season pretty much last year. ... I think the chemistry's always been there. I think we're just connecting on some plays that we haven't, bearing down on some areas that we weren't able to last year. And Pacioretty coming on to that line is a huge asset.\"\n\nTuch got things started when he grabbed a rebound and popped it past Gibson late in the first period. Vegas went up 2-0 just 25 seconds into the second, when Tuch fed Eakin, who sniped Gibson with a wrist shot above the glove.\n\nHolden was credited with the next goal after his shot from the point caromed off the end board and into the crease, where Ducks center Adam Henrique accidentally put the puck past Gibson, who was pulled immediately afterward.\n\nBut the red-hot Eakin skated in on a breakaway and scored his seventh of the season with a backhand over Miller's glove two minutes later, making it 4-0.\n\nHyka got his first goal of the season when he skated in from the left wing and beat Miller stick side.\n\n\"When they got the emotions going and they got fired up, you can expect that kind of pace from their hockey club, and I don't think that's a surprise to us,\" Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle said. \"After our last game, we didn't seem in the competitive spirit, and that surprises us.\"\n\nNOTES: In recognition of Military Appreciation Night, 92-year-old Edward Hall, the last survivor in Southern Nevada from the attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, dropped the ceremonial first puck. ... Ducks defenseman Cam Fowler, who was struck in the face with a puck on Monday night versus Nashville, has a complex right facial fracture involving the orbital bone, cheekbone and upper jaw bone, per a CT scan. Fowler will have surgery Friday, after which his expected absence will be known and announced. ... Gibson remains one victory shy of 100 career NHL wins. ... Anaheim has successfully killed 23 of its last 26 opponent power-play opportunities.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDucks: Host Toronto on Friday\n\nGolden Knights: Hosts St. Louis on Friday\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSome things to know about Week 12 in the Big 12 Conference:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nNo. 18 Iowa State (6-3, 5-2 Big 12) at No. 13 Texas (7-3, 5-2). The winner will still be in contention for a spot in the Big 12 title game and the loser would be eliminated if conference co-leaders No. 6 Oklahoma and No. 7 West Virginia both win Saturday. Iowa State, with freshman quarterback Brock Purdy, has won five Big 12 games in a row for the first time. After consecutive losses by a combined four points, sophomore QB Sam Ehlinger led the Longhorns on a late game-winning drive at Texas Tech \u2014 like he did earlier this season against Oklahoma. Ehlinger has thrown a Big 12-record 280 consecutive passes without an interception. Texas won its last Big 12 title in 2009, when it was also the last team from the league to play in a national championship game. Iowa State, which has lost 13 of 15 in the series, has never won the conference.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nThe quarterbacks when No. 7 West Virginia (8-1, 6-1) plays at Oklahoma State (5-5, 2-5). WVU's Will Grier, the Heisman Trophy contender, has thrown for 329 yards a game with 31 TDs. Taylor Cornelius, OSU's fifth-year senior and first-time starter, has thrown for 312 yards per game with 23 touchdowns. Cornelius does have to throw against a Mountaineers defense has allowed only 233 yards passing a game and a league-low 13 TD passes. Grier has 1,042 yards passing with nine TDs and one interception in three games since only 100 yards in a loss at Iowa State.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nOklahoma, which has won 15 consecutive November games, is the nation's only team with at least 30 rushing touchdowns (31) and at least 30 passing TDs (33). ... Texas Tech WR Antoine Wesley leads the nation with 134.7 yards receiving per game . He has four 150-yard games, including 199 and 171 in the last two. ... Kansas State has averaged 212 yards rushing with 14 TDs in the past five games. ... TCU and Baylor, both still trying to get bowl eligible, meet in the most-played series for both schools. TCU leads 54-52-7 in the series that dates back to 1899.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nKansas has only two games left with coach David Beaty and will be more than a five-TD underdog at No. 6 Oklahoma. The Sooners have won the last 13 games in the series by an average margin of 31 points. Oklahoma's last home loss in the series was 1996, the first Big 12 season.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nLil'Jordan Humphrey is the first Texas player since 2012 with consecutive 100-yard receiving games. He had eight catches for a career-high 159 yards last week against Texas Tech, and his second TD catch was a game-winning 29-yarder with 21 seconds left. Humphrey has 63 catches for 947 yards and seven TDs this season.\n\n___\n\nCompiled by AP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Yet they're still in line to play for the Big Ten championship if they take care of business at Maryland (5-5, 3-4) and win \"The Game\" against Michigan for the seventh straight year. The two-touchdown-underdog Terrapins are short-handed. Tyrrell Pigrome will start at quarterback after Kasim Hill tore the ACL in his left knee last week against Indiana, and injured running backs Ty Johnson and Javon Leake are game-time decisions.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nNebraska run offense vs. Michigan State run defense.\n\nDevine Ozigbo is on the cusp of becoming Nebraska's first 1,000-yard rusher since 2014 and combines with Adrian Martinez and Maurice Washington to average better than 200 yards a game. Michigan State is holding opponents to a nation-low 76.5 rushing yards per game and 2.6 yards per carry. Nebraska right tackle Matt Farniok figures to have his hands full with defensive end Kenny Willekes, who had career highs of 13 tackles and 3.5 for loss against Ohio State last week.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nNational rushing leader Jonathan Taylor of Wisconsin has gone over 100 yards in nine games, the most by an FBS player, and averages 154.8 yards per game. ... Purdue goes into its game against Big Ten rushing leader Wisconsin having allowed a season-high 265 rushing yards to Minnesota. ... Michigan, which hosts Indiana, hasn't lost to the Hoosiers since 1987 and lead the series 57-9. ... Michigan has outscored opponents 182-66 in first halves and 188-63 in second halves. ... Penn State has clinched its 14th consecutive winning season and has won nine straight meetings with this week's opponent, Rutgers. ... Rutgers is yet to score more than 17 points against a power-five opponent. ... In November games, Illinois leads the nation in rushing yards (813), yards per carry (9.68) and rushing touchdowns (10).\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nMinnesota is 2 1/2-point underdog at home to Northwestern.\n\nThe Gophers (5-5, 2-5) are a bit of a mystery, beating Purdue by 31 points last week after getting beaten by 24 at Illinois the week before. Northwestern (6-4, 6-1) locked up the West Division title at Iowa last week. The Wildcats have had to grind to get where they are, and it will be interesting to see if there is some letdown now that their ticket is punched for the Big Ten title game. The Gophers have an opportunity to get bowl eligible before heading to Wisconsin to play for the Axe.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nIowa TE Noah Fant.\n\nFant is at the center of the West Division's biggest soap opera heading into the Hawkeyes' game at Illinois. Arguably the nation's best eight end, he inexplicably was on the sideline for all but eight snaps in the second half as the reeling Hawkeyes tried to come back against Northwestern. Unknown is what's going on between Fant and the staff. What's known is the junior is a projected early-round NFL draft pick if he chooses to leave school.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Farm Bureau found that Thanksgiving retail turkey prices are the lowest since 2014.\n\n\u201cSince 2015, the average cost of Thanksgiving dinner has declined steadily and is now at the lowest level since 2010,\u201d said John Newton, the organization's chief economist. \"Thanks to an ample supply, turkey remains affordable for consumers, which helps keep the overall cost of the dinner reasonably priced as well.\"\n\nMore: Monopoly for Millennials reminds players that 'adulting is hard'\n\nMore: At Nike NYC, an app delivers clothes to the fitting room, and pays for what you buy\n\nMore: Powerball winner, a single mom, shares her wealth with wounded veterans\n\nOther foods in the feast survey are:\n\nStuffing: 14-ounce package, $2.87 (up from $2.81 in 2017)\n\n14-ounce package, $2.87 (up from $2.81 in 2017) Sweet potatoes: 3-pound bag, $3.39 (down from $3.52)\n\n3-pound bag, $3.39 (down from $3.52) Rolls: A dozen, $2.25 (down from $2.26)\n\nA dozen, $2.25 (down from $2.26) Green peas: 1-pound bag, $1.47 (down from $1.53)\n\n1-pound bag, $1.47 (down from $1.53) Fresh cranberries: 12-ounce bag, $2.65 (up from $2.43)\n\n12-ounce bag, $2.65 (up from $2.43) Carrot-celery tray: 1-pound, 75 cents (up from 74 cents)\n\n1-pound, 75 cents (up from 74 cents) Pumpkin pie: 30-ounce can of mix, $3.33 (up from $3.21); two 9-inch pie shells, $2.47 (up from $2.45); whipped cream, $2.08 (unchanged)\n\nMilk: 1-gallon whole fat, $2.92 (down from $2.99)\n\n1-gallon whole fat, $2.92 (down from $2.99) Coffee and ingredients needed for recipes, such as butter, evaporated milk, onions, eggs, sugar and flour: $3.01 (up from $2.72)\n\n\"Thanksgiving continues to be an affordable meal for Americans across the country at less than $5 per person for that classic meal,\" Newton said. \"Food prices have been relatively flat in the U.S. for a number of years.\"\n\nHowever, ordering a traditional Thanksgiving spread from popular food delivery services drives the average total up about 60 percent, with a 16-pound turkey at close to 50 percent more, or about $2 per pound. This is the first time the Farm Bureau examined delivery services.\n\nAlso debuting this year is the organization's exploration of the costs of some other Thanksgiving foods. Adding in a 4-pound bone-in ham, 5 pounds of Russet potatoes and a pound of frozen green beans brings the average meal tab to $61.72.\n\nThe Farm Bureau conducted its survey with 166 volunteer shoppers at grocery stores in 37 states, who were charged with finding the best prices without using coupons or promotional deals.\n\n\"After adjusting for inflation, the cost of this year\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner is $19.37, the most affordable in more than a decade,\" the organization said.\n\nKaren Koscher Jones said she plans to spend three days cooking and at least $300 for her Thanksgiving dinner. Her Alpharetta, Georgia, table will compriseher family of four, plus eight guests.\n\nWhat makes the 53-year-old bookkeeper's shopping bill so high is most of what she buys is organic and nothing is frozen. While Jones opts for a Whole Foods bird and homemade whipped cream, gravy and fruit cup appetizers, she said she appreciates that there are foods for all price levels.\n\n\"Thanksgiving is our favorite holiday of the year,\" she said. \"It's home-based.

Nathan MacKinnon wanted to give him something more \u2014 full credit.\n\n\"All Mikko there,\" he said.\n\nMacKinnon scored the tiebreaking goal with 10:58 remaining on a nifty pass from Rantanen, and the Colorado Avalanche rallied past the Boston Bruins 6-3 on Wednesday night in a showdown between two of the top scoring lines in the league.\n\nSemyon Varlamov made 20 saves and the Avalanche scored four times in the third period after trailing by two in the second.\n\n\"It's always good to beat a good team like them,\" MacKinnon said.\n\nThis is no line, either: Colorado took momentary bragging rights in boasting the most explosive unit in the NHL.\n\nThe Avs' top line of Gabriel Landeskog (goal), MacKinnon (goal and an assist) and Rantanen (goal and two assists) produced six points to give them a league-leading 75 for the season.\n\nThe squad outperformed the unit right behind them as the Bruins' top trio of Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron and David Pastrnak combined for a goal and two assists. They ran their season total to 71 points.\n\nFrom one top line to the other, Bergeron was certainly impressed.\n\n\"All three of them are great players, no question about it,\" Bergeron said. \"They see each other well. They're tough to defend and it was a great challenge, a good matchup. It was a fun game.\"\n\nJake DeBrusk scored twice for the Bruins. Jaroslav Halak finished with 19 saves.\n\nBoston defenseman Zdeno Chara sustained a lower-body injury in the first period and didn't return. He finished a check on Carl Soderberg along the boards and appeared to favor his left leg. After that, the Bruins were down to five defensemen.\n\nBoston coach Bruce Cassidy said the team would have more information about Chara on Thursday.\n\n\"It seems like we're losing a guy every game,\" Halak said. \"We need to keep playing hard and whoever comes in the lineup has to step up.\"\n\nAvalanche forward Matt Calvert tied the score at 3 early in the third when he banked in a shot off the skate of a Bruins defenseman. That set the stage for MacKinnon, who used his speed to get ahead of the defense and knock in his 12th goal.\n\n\"He gave me so much room. It was a great play by (Rantanen),\" MacKinnon said.\n\nBoth teams scored power-play goals in the second \u2014 DeBrusk to give Boston a 3-1 lead and Rantanen to trim the deficit.\n\nColorado led 1-0 midway through the first after Landeskog scored off a backhand pass from Rantanen. The Bruins hit three posts in the period, but found the net on a tip-in from Pastrnak and 2:37 later DeBrusk cruised in all alone and juked Varlamov for a goal. The breakaway was set up by a turnover from MacKinnon as he sent an errant pass right to DeBrusk, who was trailing the play because he dropped his stick.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that in any league,\" DeBrusk said. \"I didn't know what happened. I just saw the puck pop out and was at the red line already so I had a good head start.\"\n\nBoston and Colorado were looking forward to this matchup, given the offensive firepower of the top lines. Each coach vowed to pit them against each other as often as possible.\n\nThey did, too.\n\n\"It's a good motivating factor for MacKinnon's line and for Bergeron's line to sort of want to put a stamp on being the best one,\" Cassidy said.\n\nMacKinnon and Marchand know each other quite well. Both are from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and sometimes skate together in the offseason. But they work out separately.\n\n\"Nate can't keep up. He's got to work out with someone else,\" Marchand joked. \"He's an incredible player \u2014 very hard to play against.\"\n\nNOTES: Boston G Tuukka Rask served as a backup.

No friends or relatives of Ramos or his victims witnessed the execution.\n\nRelated: Death knell for capital punishment? Washington becomes 20th state to ban executions\n\nMexican officials had called for his execution to be stopped, arguing he was part of a group of Mexican citizens condemned in the U.S. who were never told when first arrested that they could get legal help from the Mexican government.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday night cleared the way for the punishment when it denied two appeals seeking to halt the lethal injection. Ramos\u2019 attorney on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to stop his execution, arguing that Ramos\u2019 constitutional rights were violated as lower courts refused to fully review his claims that his trial lawyers failed to present any evidence about his mental illness and abusive childhood that could have persuaded jurors to spare his life.\n\nThree retired justices who had served on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals filed court documents with the Supreme Court on Wednesday in support of stopping the execution. The ex-judges alleged the appeals court appointed an incompetent appellate attorney who early in the post-conviction process failed to investigate Ramos\u2019 case.\n\nAlso Wednesday, a federal judge in Austin dismissed Ramos\u2019 request to temporarily block the execution. The request had been part of a lawsuit Ramos filed against the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals a day earlier. The suit alleged the appeals court had not allowed Ramos to present claims he had ineffective trial and appellate lawyers.\n\nThe 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had previously turned down requests to halt Ramos\u2019 execution.\n\nThe Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday declined to recommend either a commutation of his sentence or a six-month reprieve.\n\nIn court documents, Ramos\u2019 appellate attorney, Danalynn Recer, had argued Ramos suffered from bipolar disorder most of his life, including during the time of his family\u2019s killings, as well as brain damage that affected his ability to control his impulses and regulate his emotions.\n\nRecer said Ramos was also brutally beaten as a child by his father.\n\nRamos was born in Aguascalientes, Mexico, and grew up in Guadalajara and Tijuana before his family moved to the United States in 1970.\n\n\u201cNo fact-finder or decision-maker entrusted with Mr. Moreno Ramos\u2019 life has ever been provided with evidence of (his) \u2018diverse human frailties\u2019 to assist them in dispensing the most severe punishment under law,\u201d Recer said.\n\nBut the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office said Ramos\u2019 death sentence was appropriate due to his \u201cviolent and dangerous nature.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/14/roberto-moreno-ramos-executed-texas-killings-wife-kids/2009253002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Loyola-Chicago pulls away early, beats Niagara 75-62", "description": "Cameron Krutwig had 18 points and 11 rebounds to lead Loyola-Chicago to a 75-62 victory over Niagara", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/15/loyola-chicago-pulls-away-early-beats-niagara-75-62/38532467/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T05:27:33Z", "content": "CHICAGO (AP) Cameron Krutwig had 18 points and 11 rebounds to lead Loyola-Chicago to a 75-62 victory over Niagara on Wednesday night.

Devin Watson had 14 points and eight assists.\n\nThe Aztecs (2-0) open the Maui Invitational against a Duke team that opened the season with a 118-84 win against Kentucky and has won its three games by an average of 28 points.\n\n\"They're talented at every position. They're well-coached,\" SDSU coach Brian Dutcher said. \"But I want to get them into a close game. I'd like to find a way to get the game close down the stretch. And I think Coach K would like that, too. He's not served very well by winning all these games by 20 or 30.

I hope we're the first one.\"\n\nDutcher will have to figure out a way to try to stop freshman Zion Williamson, who is 6-foot-7, 285 pounds.\n\nThe beefiest Aztecs player is Matt Mitchell, who is 6-6, 230.\n\n\"We're giving up some weight but we'll be close. I think that will be a fun matchup,\" Dutcher said.\n\n\"I've said I want to play Duke,\" Dutcher added. \"I'd just as soon it was in the championship game of the Maui Invitational. But I don't want to go over there and not have a chance to play the No. 1 team in the country. That's why these kids come to San Diego State. We promise them we'll play marquee games and give them the opportunity to play on the biggest stage.\"\n\nSaid Mitchell: \"We have a good feel for our team and where we are right now, but I think Duke will be a test. Again, being the No. 1 team in the country, it'll be a test for us to see where we are.\"\n\nMcDaniels, who returned for his sophomore season after considering entering the NBA draft, opened the game with a 3-pointer and had seven points, four rebounds and one steal in the opening five minutes. Later in the half, he made an alley-oop pass to Nathan Mensah for a slam dunk and a 34-17 lead.\n\nBut McDaniels also got into early foul trouble and played only 10 minutes in the first half.\n\nMitchell and Schackel each had 10 points to help SDSU take a 49-28 halftime lead. Mensah finished with 11 points and Jeremy Hemsley had 10.\n\nDuke had a 48-11 lead against Eastern Michigan just before halftime of an 84-46 win Wednesday night.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it scares us,\" Mitchell says of seeing scores like that. \"Everybody's human. Of course you have to take notice of what they're capable of but we'll tackle that once we get there, and excel in practice and hopefully get there and excel at what we do best.\"\n\nDerrick Bruce and Jeremy Combs scored 15 points apiece for Texas Southern (1-3).\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nTexas Southern: This was the fourth of six straight road games for the Tigers to begin the season.

(Photo: John Bazemore, AP)\n\nA federal judge\u2019s split-decision ruling Wednesday night energized the campaigns of both Georgia gubernatorial candidates but didn\u2019t bring resolution to a bitter race that stretched into its second week.\n\nWhile U.S. District Judge Steve Jones sided with the Stacey Abrams\u2019 campaign, ordering that the secretary of state\u2019s office must not certify election results without confirming each county\u2019s vote tally includes absentee ballots on which the voter\u2019s date of birth is missing or incorrect, he ruled against them on two other points.\n\nThe judge will not require counties to accept absentee ballots with incorrect addresses or provisional ballots cast by people who tried to vote in the wrong county, prompting Brian Kemp\u2019s campaign to again claim victory.\n\n\u201cTonight, \u200fJudge Jones rejected efforts by Stacey Abrams and her radical allies to undermine the democratic process and rule of law in Georgia,\u201d said Kemp\u2019s communications director, Ryan Mahoney. \u201cHe denied her requests to create new voters and slammed the door on attempts to count illegal votes.\n\n\u201cThis ruling solidifies Brian Kemp\u2019s insurmountable lead. The election is over and Kemp is the Governor-elect. It's time for Abrams to concede and join our efforts to keep Georgia moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nMore: Federal judge orders review of all provisional ballots in Georgia, delays deadline for certification\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign, however, had a differing point of view while renewing its claims of voter suppression against Kemp, who, last week, resigned as secretary of state while declaring victory in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cThis is a major victory for Georgia voters and the Abrams campaign in the fight to ensure every eligible vote is counted and every voice is heard,\u201d said Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019 campaign manager. \u201cUnder Brian Kemp\u2019s watch as the nation\u2019s foremost architect of voter suppression, countless Georgians have had substantial roadblocks placed in their path as they sought to exercise their fundamental right to vote.\n\n\u201cNow, the courts are doing what Brian Kemp\u2019s Secretary of State office refused to \u2013 upholding and protecting Georgia\u2019s rights and underlining the need for free and fair elections in a state that has suffered from an acute assault on voting rights engineered by none other than Secretary of State Brian Kemp.\u201d\n\nKemp leads Abrams by nearly 55,000 votes as of Thursday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Groh-Wargo said the Abrams campaign believes she needs a net gain of 17,759 votes to pull Kemp below a majority threshold and force a Dec. 4 runoff. Kemp\u2019s campaign said even if every vote that Abrams campaign is arguing for is granted by the courts and counted for her, she cannot overcome his lead or force a runoff.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the race.\n\nState law requires Secretary of State Robyn Crittenden to certify the election by Tuesday. But Jones prohibited Crittenden from certifying results until she confirms that each county\u2019s returns include the counts for absentee ballots where the birth date was missing or incorrect.\n\nDemocrats beyond Georgia have started to echo the notion that a Kemp victory would be illegitimate. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown said Wednesday that if Abrams loses it\u2019s because Republicans stole the election.\n\n\u201cIf Stacey Abrams doesn\u2019t win in Georgia, they stole it. I say that publicly, it\u2019s clear,\u201d Brown said during a briefing for the National Action Network.\n\nHillary Clinton said Abrams \"already would have won\" if the election had been fair. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called for a federal investigation.\n\nThe controversy ignited protests Tuesday at the State Capitol. At least 15 people were arrested including State Senator Nikema Williams.\n\nProtesters were demanding that every vote be counted in the midterm election.\n\nKemp\u2019s campaign, which has repeatedly called on Abrams to concede, repeated that call Wednesday, saying Abrams and her supporters have used \u201cfake vote totals,\u201d \u201cdesperate press conferences\u201d and \u201cdangerous lawsuits\u201d to try to steal the election.\n\n\u201cAfter all of the theatrics, the math remains the same,\u201d Kemp campaign spokesman Cody Hall said in an email. \u201cAbrams lost and Brian Kemp won. This election is over.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Democrat Stacey Abrams has vowed not to concede to Republican Brian Kemp and plans to file a federal class-action lawsuit to push back the date of certification until every ballot has been logged.

Boatwright shot 5 of 7 from the floor and made four 3-pointers in 18 minutes. He had last season cut short by a knee injury that required surgery and he toyed with leaving early for the NBA draft.\n\n\"It's been a tough nine months not playing basketball,\" Boatwright said. \"It made me mentally strong. I'm going to stay even-keeled. Struggle helps you a lot mentally. When you go through things you have to find a way to get through it.\"\n\nNick Rakocevic had 16 points and 13 rebounds \u2014 his third double-double in as many games \u2014 for the Trojans (2-1).\n\nThey started on a 30-7 run, including 14 straight points, and the Hatters (1-2) never recovered in a game played as part of the Hall of Fame Classic. All of USC's seven players on the floor in the first half scored while the team shot 54 percent.\n\n\"We wanted to start off fast and we just had to maintain,\" said freshman Kevin Porter Jr., who made his first start.\n\nChristiaan Jones had 11 points for the Hatters in their first visit to California since 1995. They were just 9 of 34 from the floor in the first half and made just 4 of 22 3-pointers in the game.\n\n\"I just feel like we came out weak,\" Jones said. \"We missed a lot of shots, let them get a lot of opportunities offensively. We just weren't there defensively.\"\n\nThe Hatters gave up 90 points for the first time since allowing 91 at USC Upstate on Feb. 8.\n\n\"They had a lot to do with that,\" Stetson coach Corey Williams said of the Trojans. \"They're a big, strong, imposing team. We just didn't rise to the challenge the first half.\"\n\nUSC began the second half on a 35-18 spurt that extended its lead to 74-32. Boatwright sandwiched 3-pointers around another basket. Porter punctuated the run with a one-handed dunk, drew the foul and made the free throw.\n\n\"Bennie got it going in the second half,\" USC coach Andy Enfield said. \"We need his perimeter shooting, size and experience. He looked like he was in control.\"\n\nPorter, the freshman five-star recruit, finished with 12 points, his third straight game in double figures.\n\n\"I tell him every day Showtime,\" Boatwright said. \"The sky is the limit for him. He's confident in himself and carries himself the right way.\"\n\nThe Trojans' largest lead was 41 points with 2:55 left in the second half.\n\nUSC's Elijah Weaver had nine points in his collegiate debut after missing the first two games. He had left ankle surgery on Aug. 30.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nStetson: The Hatters are putting up big numbers to start the season. They scored 116 points in a season-opening win against Johnson and had 66 rebounds (second-most in school history) in a loss at Missouri State. Their bench averaged 60 points in those two games.\n\nUSC: Getting Boatwright back is huge for the Trojans as they take a considerable step up in competition against Texas Tech on a neutral court Monday.

South Korea's hugely popular Olympic curlers have accused their coaches of ruining the team with abusive treatment in a dispute that has spoiled one of the year's feel-good sports stories.(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The Garlic Girls, South Korea's hugely popular Olympic silver medalist curlers, accused their coaches Thursday of ruining the team with abusive treatment in a dispute that has spoiled one of the year's feel-good sports stories.\n\nThe women's claims, if confirmed, suggest a familiar tale of abuse, corruption and nepotism that has regularly marred South Korea's highly hierarchical elite sports scene. Men often run South Korean sports efforts, and while the team's head coach is a woman, men in her family, including her father, a former leading figure in South Korean curling, play a prominent part in the team's accusations of abuse.\n\n\"We can no longer work with a coaching staff that is trying to divide the team,\" Kim Seon-yeong said in a glum news conference in Seoul. The players also accused the coaching staff of skipping training sessions, holding back prize money and trying to force a married member off the team.\n\n\"We need a coaching staff that can train and lead us properly. We want to continue our curling careers and aim for bigger goals at the Beijing Olympics,\" Kim said.\n\nThe news conference came a day after South Korea's Sports Ministry and National Olympic Committee announced a joint investigation into allegations that became public after the athletes sent a letter outlining their complaints to sports authorities last week.\n\nThe five-member women's curling team became an overnight sensation after their improbable silver medal run in February's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. They enthralled a country that barely recognized curling before they made their run and became sought-after spokeswomen in commercials. Their nickname is a nod to the famous garlic produced in their hometown in Uiseong, in southern South Korea, where they met and began playing together as teenagers.\n\nIn their letter to the Korean Sport and Olympic Committee last week, Kim Eun-jung, Kim Seon-yeong, Kim Cho-hee, and sisters Kim Yeong-ae and Kim Yeong-mi accused former Korean Curling Federation vice-president Kim Kyung-doo of verbal abuse and team coaches of giving unreasonable orders and subjecting their lives to excessive control.\n\nIn Thursday's news conference, the curlers said coaches told them what to say in interviews and closely monitored their private lives after training hours, scolding them if they met with athletes from rival teams. Letters and presents sent by fans \"were already ripped open\" before they reached the curlers, Kim Seon-yeong said.\n\n\"We can't understand why the head coach had to rip open and check the presents and letters sent to individuals before they reached the athlete,\" she said.\n\nThe curlers said the coaches withheld prize money and tried to sideline the married captain Kim Eun-jung after learning of her plans to start a family. They said the coaches also tried to force Kim Cho-hee off the team ahead of the Olympics to open a spot for head coach Kim Min-jung to participate as an athlete. They also said they had to endure a tirade from Kim Kyung-doo after they decided to stick with their teammate.\n\nKim Kyung-doo and his family had extensive control over the team with his daughter, Kim Min-jung, being the head coach and his son-in-law, Jang Ban-seok, the mixed doubles coach. The curlers organized the news conference after the coaching staff publicly denied the accusations.\n\n\"We had thought we could go together with that family, but after going through the Olympics, it became clear to us they were a family that cared only about themselves,\" Kim Eun-jung said in the news conference. \"They don't want the athletes to grow and get better. ... They don't want the athletes to become bigger than the organization.\"\n\nJang denied funds were withheld from the athletes, saying the team had agreed prize money would be spent on overseas training and competitions, but Kim Eun-jung said the curlers were kept in the dark about how the money was used.\n\n\"We were already receiving (state) training funds as members of the national team, and we couldn't understand why the prize money was not being distributed to us,\" she said.\n\nSouth Korea, which has long associated Olympic achievements with national pride, has struggled to root out abuse and corruption bred by factionalism and nepotism from its highly-competitive elite sports scene, where such problems have often been overlooked as long as the athletes produce.\n\nBut the pressure for change is increasingly coming from a younger generation of athletes, who have shown less tolerance for unjust or unreasonable treatment. The Korea Skating Union in January imposed a lifetime ban on a male coach who was later sentenced to 10 months in jail for assaulting short-track speed skater Shim Suk-hee, an incident that would more likely have been kept in-house in previous years.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A fourth-quarter safety helped Miami beat Ohio, 30-28, on Nov. 7.\n\nNorthern Illinois leads the MAC West Division by two games with one game remaining at Western Michigan on November 20.\n\nRucker-Furlow stepped in front of wide receiver Spencer Tears at the Northern Illinois 28-yard line and intercepted a Marcus Childers pass. Rucker-Furlow then ran untouched along the sideline and into the endzone to cap the scoring with 7:21 remaining in the third quarter.\n\nThe Huskies crossed into Miami territory just once more but they turned the ball over on downs at the 46 with six minutes left in the third. Childers led a 10-play drive to the 50 with three minutes remaining in the game yet the drive stalled with an incomplete pass on fourth-and-2.\n\nTre Harbison ran for 103 yards for Northern Illinois. Marcus Jones' 29-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter gave the Huskies a 7-3 lead.\n\nSamuel Slomankicked field goals from 30 and 39 yards for the RedHawks.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Digital Vision., Getty Images)\n\nAmerican women aren't buying into the doom-and-gloom retirement narrative any longer.\n\nThey increasingly are viewing their retirement years with optimism, referring to the aging process as a \"liberating phase\" of their lives, a time to pursue fresh goals, experience new things and pursue meaningful work, according to a new survey from TD Ameritrade that USA TODAY obtained exclusively.\n\n\"Women are so enthusiastic when it comes to aging, and that is a different message than what is out there,\" says Christine Russell, senior manager of retirement and annuities at TD Ameritrade, a discount brokerage firm, referring to female savings shortfalls and other retirement obstacles.\n\n\"We tend to focus on hard dollars and cents and the fact that women live longer than men,\" she says. \"And that often can cause doom and gloom. But the survey found that women feel much more confident about their golden years.\"\n\n70 is the new 50\n\nIn a sign that women are becoming more optimistic about the aging process, nearly three out of four (73 percent) agreed that \"70 is the new 50,\" versus just 59 percent of men, according to TD Ameritrade's \"Women & Aging Survey,\" a July poll of more than 2,000 U.S. adults 18 and older conducted for it by The Harris Poll.\n\nThe statistics suggest women are \"planning for a longer life,\" an acknowledgment that should focus them more intensely on taking the financial steps necessary to be able to fund the life they want to lead in their later years, Russell explains.\n\n\"It's important for women to know why they are saving and how they want retirement to look,\" Russell says. \"It's important to have both pieces.\"\n\nRetirement as 'opportunity'\n\nFor an increasing number of women, retirement equates to opportunity and a life with \"a higher purpose,\" rather than a period of boredom and a sense that their best years are behind them, according to the survey results.\n\nSixty-two percent of women said retirement will be \"the most liberating phase of my life.\" Seventy-two percent said after years of focusing on others, aging finally gives them an \"opportunity to focus on myself,\" while 83 percent said aging provides a fresh chance to \"reach new goals.\"\n\nWhen asked what age they would like to retire, the average age was 61.\n\nWhile 68 percent of women said they would like to spend more time with family and friends in retirement, 56 percent said they wanted to focus on their \"health and wellness\" as well as \"seek out new experiences,\" such as traveling abroad, versus just 47 percent of males.\n\nMore: Was Amazon's headquarters search 'a giant ruse'?

Seventy-six percent said that \"compared to 20 years ago, there are more opportunities to pursue meaningful work as people age.\"\n\nNearly nine of 10 (88 percent) women surveyed said, \"It's important to me to retain a sense of higher purpose as I age.\"\n\nMoney isn't everything\n\nMoney isn't everything, the women said. Their health is more important.\n\nNearly half (47 percent) of the women said they were willing to trade away half or more of their wealth to \"be healthy to the end of (their) life.\"\n\n\"The survey shows that women don't view aging as just sitting on the porch or rocking chair waiting for death,\" Russell says. \"They're saying, 'that's not what we are going to do.' Instead they are moving ahead, learning new things and achieving new goals.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/15/retirement-women-aging/1990120002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "UT Rio Grande Valley holds off Prairie View, wins 79-57", "description": "Lesley Varner II scored 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as Texas-Rio Grande Valley rode a 10-point first-half lead to a 79-57 victory over Prairie View A&M", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/14/ut-rio-grande-valley-holds-off-prairie-view-wins-79-57/38532421/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T04:56:38Z", "content": "EDINBURGH, Texas (AP) Lesley Varner II scored 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as Texas-Rio Grande Valley rode a 10-point first-half lead to a 79-57 victory over Prairie View A&amp;M on Wednesday night.

Up to this point, Gutekunst has made it clear he wants to reshape the Packers roster he inherited from Ted Thompson.\n\nBefore his first draft as general manager, Gutekunst had to create space for the impending free agent signings and the rookies. This year\u2019s free agent departures were not as controversial as 2017\u2019s class, yet at least one cap-saving cut early on did not please fans.\n\nHere\u2019s an update on the players that left the Packers this past offseason:\n\nWR Jordy Nelson (cut)\n\nMarch 13, 2018: A date which will live in infamy, at least according to Packers fans. Fan-favorite wide receiver Jordy Nelson was cut from the team unceremoniously, giving an insight into how business in the NFL can be emotionally cold and brutal.\n\nNelson finished his career in Green Bay with 604 receptions for 8,516 yards and 74 touchdowns throughout the regular season and playoffs.\n\nThe decision to release the 33-year-old receiver stemmed from cap space issues. Nelson was slated to take up $12.5 million on the Packers cap space in 2018 and was coming off a career-worst season. Fellow receiver Randall Cobb had a similar cap hit, but he was only 27 years old at the time. Football is a young man\u2019s game and the Packers didn\u2019t want to keep an \u201cold\u201d receiver.\n\nThe Packers offered to re-structure Nelson\u2019s contract, but it was an embarrassing lowball deal. Nelson chose to sign a two-year, $15 million deal with the Oakland Raiders.\n\nJordy Nelson with his first TD as a Raider! [via @Raiders]pic.twitter.com/IExBf4nvu4 \u2014 NBCSAuthentic (@NBCSAuthentic) September 23, 2018\n\nOn the year, Nelson has 25 catches for 353 yards and three touchdowns. The veteran receiver has started eight of nine games for Oakland and is currently dealing with a bone bruise injury he suffered last week against the Chargers.\n\nS Morgan Burnett\n\nWas it a mistake to let Burnett walk given the Packers safety situation this year? Maybe.\n\nIt was thought Burnett\u2019s price tag would be too steep for Green Bay to re-sign him. Via Packers Wire:\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Burnett has a calculated market value of $9.8 million per year as he heads into free agency. The site believes Burnett will be able to find a deal worth over $10 million per year on the open market.\n\nWell, they were wrong. A depressed safety market didn\u2019t help Burnett, and he ended up signing a three-year deal with the Steelers worth $14.5 million. That equates to about $4.8 million per year, even less than the four-year extension he signed in 2013 that averaged $6.5 million.\n\nIn Green Bay, Burnett played for eight seasons, started 102 games and recorded nine interceptions. In Pittsburgh, he\u2019s only managed to see action in five games and start only one. He had been out since Week 2 with a groin injury and returned to the field after the bye week to face Cleveland in Week 8.\n\nAfter missing the past four games because of an injury, @MoBetta_42 came back \u2013 and so did the Steelers\u2019 passing defense, writes @C_AdamskiTrib #HereWeGohttps://t.co/boykpWzNk5 \u2014 Tribune-ReviewSports (@TribSports) October 28, 2018\n\nOG Jahri Evans\n\nThe Packers signed Evans to a one-year, $2.25 million deal in 2017 to fill the void at T.J. Lang\u2019s previous right guard spot. At 34-years-old, Evans played well in his 14 starts. He earned a 71.7 overall grade from PFF after the 2017 season.\n\nThe development of Justin McCray made the Packers decision not to shell out another couple million for Evans easy. Despite his solid play, Evans remains unsigned by any team in 2018.\n\nOLB Ahmad Brooks\n\nBrooks also signed on for a one-year deal with the Packers for $3.5 million. The team was desperate for some depth behind oft-injured Clay Matthews and Nick Perry. Unfortunately, the team passed on better options, waiting until the end of training camp to pick off the scrap heap of other teams.\n\nBrooks was released by the 49ers before the start of the season and the Packers picked him up. He saw action in 12 games, was solid playing run defense but produced only 1.5 sacks.\n\nAhmad Brooks stones the block in the hole & makes the tackle along with Martinez (who strikes/sheds well) #Packers pic.twitter.com/cKGCENDqwK \u2014 DLineVids (@DLineVids) December 26, 2017\n\nLike Evans, Brooks was a stopgap as the Packers waited for younger players at the position to develop such as Reggie Gilbert and Kyler Fackrell.\n\nThe 34-year-old Brooks also remains unsigned in 2018 after serving a six-game suspension to begin the season.\n\nWR Jeff Janis\n\nAccording to some fans, letting Janis walk was the Packers\u2019 biggest mistake. We won\u2019t get into that discussion, but the fan-favorite had his moments in Green Bay.\n\nJanis finished his four-year run with 24 receptions for 345 yards and three receiving touchdowns. He also added one rushing touchdown from 19 yards out.\n\nMany will remember Janis\u2019 performance in the 2015 playoffs against the Arizona Cardinals where he caught not one, but two Hail Mary throws.\n\nAaron Rodgers did it again: Packers down to 1 last play\u2026 Rodgers finds Jeff Janis for the HAIL MARY #Touchdown \ud83d\udcaf https://t.co/nqOSTI5eUG \u2014 NFL (@NFL) January 17, 2016\n\nJanis had potential as a receiver, but he never got on the same page with Aaron Rodgers and had issues running routes other than verticals. His strength was on special teams and was a big reason why the Packers gave up the seventh-least punt return yards (164), according to ESPN. They also ranked sixth in punt return average (5.7).\n\nAfter not being re-signed after the season, Janis caught on with Cleveland but was cut near the end of training camp. The young receiver and special teams ace remains unsigned.\n\nThe Rest\n\nLB Joe Thomas signed a two-year, $3.6 million deal with Dallas in March. He has seen action in five games this season. He has been dealing with a foot injury and hasn\u2019t seen the field since Week 5.\n\nTE Richard Rodgers signed on with the Eagles for a one-year deal worth only $880,000 in April. Rodgers was injured during the preseason and landed on injured reserve.

But Booker was still a factor Wednesday night, and his teammates picked him up.\n\nT.J. Warren scored 16 of his 27 points in the first half and the Suns built a big lead, almost lost it and then pulled away for a 116-96 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe Suns ended a four-game losing streak to improve to 3-11.\n\n\"Fifty-point swing since we played them the last time,\" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said, referring to the Spurs' 120-90 win Oct. 31. \"We have to be pleased with just that fact.\"\n\nDeandre Ayton added 17 points and 10 rebounds, including a powerful dunk over Davis Bertans early in the fourth quarter. Isaiah Canaan had 19 points and made all five of his 3-pointers,\n\nBooker had 13 points and a career high 12 assists \u2014 though he committed seven turnovers \u2014 and the Suns shot a season-high 56 percent.\n\n\"I just had to keep making plays for other people,\" Booker said. \"A lot of laughter and smiles after the game, and that's the feeling we want around here.\"\n\nDeMar DeRozan had 24 points for the Spurs, and Derrick White added 16. They have lost four of five.\n\n\"We have been terrible defensively,\" DeRozan said. \"We didn't make nothing too uncomfortable for them. They kept their rhythm and pulled away again. We can't let that happen and it all starts on defense.\"\n\nWarren's short jumper with 6:42 to play gave the Suns a 105-85 lead, and Phoenix was able to close it out comfortably.\n\nThe Spurs trailed by one early in the third quarter, but the Suns extended their lead. Warren hit a baseline 3 for a 79-66 lead, and Jamal Crawford knocked one down from the other side of the court with 58 seconds to go, giving the Suns an 82-68 lead. Crawford sank a high-arc 3 with 7.9 seconds left, and the Suns went into the final quarter ahead 87-70.\n\nCrawford scored 10 of his 11 points in the third.\n\nSan Antonio's high-scoring LaMarcus Aldridge made just 3 of 12 shots for six points against frequent double-team defense, though he added 12 rebounds.\n\n\"We're hearing 'De-fense!' Love that though. Fans have been waiting for something like that for a while,\" Ayton said.\n\nThe Suns went ahead by as many as 19 points before the first quarter ended. Warren had 12 points in the period. Canaan's jumper at the quarter buzzer gave Phoenix a 34-19 lead.\n\nThe Spurs rallied in the second quarter but got a scare when DeRozan was fouled hard on a drive and crashed to the floor. He stayed down momentarily but got to his feet, shot free throws and continued to play.\n\nSan Antonio cut the Suns' lead to 43-37 on Patty Mills' steal and layup with 4:16 left in the first half.\n\nBryn Forbes' 3 made it a two-point game before the half, and the Suns' lead was 52-48 at the intermission.

(John Woods/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) \u2014 Ben Chiarot wanted to play well against the defending Stanley Cup champions.\n\nThe defenceman did just that by scoring the tiebreaking goal with 7:09 left in the third period to lead the Winnipeg Jets to a 3-1 victory over the Washington Capitals on Wednesday night.\n\n\"We've been talking about getting on a bit of a roll here,\" Chiarot said after Winnipeg's third straight win. \"We're excited, the Stanley Cup champs coming to town you want to bring your best effort.\"\n\nChiarot's shot beat Capitals goalie Pheonix Copley on the glove side for his third of the season.\n\n\"Their (defense) was a little gapped off and I just tried to put one on net,\" Chiarot said. \"It went off (John) Carlson's shaft and it dipped on the goalie a little bit. There wasn't much to it, it was just a lucky shot.\"\n\nMark Scheifele had a power-play score for Winnipeg, and Kyle Connor added an empty-netter to seal the victory. Connor Hellebuyck made 27 saves for the Jets, who've won three straight in their four-game homestand.\n\nJakub Vrana scored for Washington, and Copley stopped 21 shots.\n\nThe Capitals were coming off a 5-2 win over Minnesota on Tuesday in the opener of a four-game road trip.\n\nCopley was in net for that win and had to quickly get ready for this game because starter Braden Holtby was a late-day scratch with an undisclosed upper-body injury. University of Manitoba women's goalie coach Gavin McHale, 31, was tapped to be Washington's emergency backup.\n\nCapitals forward Evgeny Kuznetsov left the ice in the first period soon after a check to the head by Jets forward Brandon Tanev and didn't return.\n\nWashington coach Todd Reirden said Kuznetsov was kept out for precautionary reasons. Holtby is receiving some treatment after he skated with the team's goalie coach earlier on Wednesday and will be evaluated.\n\n\"I was really proud of our guys tonight,\" Reirden said. \"You lose an elite player like Kuznetsov and you've got Pheonix Copley playing his first-ever back-to-back.\n\n\"I really liked our effort. That first period was outstanding, one of our best periods of the year.\"\n\nIt took the Jets almost 13 minutes to get their first shot on goal, but 14 seconds later Vrana used his team's eighth shot to fire the puck high past Hellebuyck for a 1-0 lead with 7 minutes left in the opening period.\n\nScheifele scored on the power play at 5:05 of the second, 7 seconds after Alex Ovechkin went to the penalty box for interference. It was his 10th goal.\n\nThe teams went into the game Nos. 1 and 2 in the league on the power play, with the Jets at 34 per cent and the Capitals at 30.3. Winnipeg was 1 for 3 on the power play and the Capitals 0 for 3.\n\n\"(Hellebuyck) made a lot of big saves,\" Scheifele said. \"He's the backbone of our team and he does that every night. .. We had a lot of big blocks, including one from (Jacob) Trouba on (Ovechkin). We had a lot of good shots from our D-men, so it was a good team effort.\"\n\nHellebuyck said facing Ovechkin during a power play is an experience.\n\n\"Not very fun,\" he said. \"The guy can shoot. He's got a lot of power play goals and you're alone with him. It's a scary thought.\"\n\nWinnipeg had squeezed Washington's shot advantage to 20-16 after the middle period. The Capitals had a power play late in the third, but couldn't solve Hellebuyck.\n\nNOTES: Washington's T.J. Oshie was flipped to the ice by Josh Morrissey late in the game and look dazed after the play. Reirden had no injury update for Oshie after the game. ... Winnipeg's Blake Wheeler had an assist, extending his point streak to 11 games (two goals, 18 assists). ...

The previous record was 23 against Sacramento on Jan. 14, 2012. The 50-point margin of victory was the second-highest in team history behind a 53-point win over Philadelphia.\n\nUtah was a point off its lowest-scoring half, set against the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 4, 2000.\n\nThe Mavericks shot 58 percent, making 43 percent of their 3-point shots.\n\n\"It was great, and I will just say that I can't remember a better defensive performance by a Mavericks team in 11 years,\" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \"I am just really impressed with the way the guys brought it against a ridiculously difficult team to play.\"\n\nThe 50-point margin of victory for Dallas tied for the second-highest in team history behind a 53-point win over Philadelphia Nov. 13, 2014.\n\nBarnes was 6 for 11 from the field, 3 for 5 on 3-pointers and 4 for 4 on free throws.\n\n\"I just feel good in general,\" Barnes said. \"I'm starting to find my rhythm.\"\n\nHe seemed more impressed with Dallas' season-best third straight win than the margin of victory.\n\n\"We haven't too many victories here in Dallas,\" Barnes said.\n\nJ.J.

Utah's Derrick Favors was charged with a Flagrant 1 foul, and three Mavericks receiving technical fouls.\n\nDallas extended its winning streak to a season-best three games. The Jazz had won three in a row and won the first two games between the teams this season.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nJazz: Their 13 points in the third quarter were a short-lived season low, not even reaching the 15 they scored in the fourth quarter at Denver on Nov. 3. ...

Kentucky won 96-58. (AP Photo/James Crisp) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) \u2014 As No. 10 Kentucky works through initial growing pains, it can feel good about its first lopsided win this season.\n\nPJ Washington set a career high with 25 points and grabbed a season-best seven rebounds, Tyler Herro added 18 points and the Wildcats rolled over North Dakota 96-58 on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Wildcats (2-1) finally got the dominant effort they sought after a rough first week in which Duke beat them by 34 points before they scraped by Southern Illinois. They had to shake off an initial back-and-forth with the Fighting Hawks (2-1), who led 13-12 before Washington's 3-pointer put Kentucky ahead to stay. The Wildcats outscored North Dakota 27-7 over 9:46 for a 39-20 cushion and led by 38 in the closing minutes.\n\nThat initial basket was big for Washington, Kentucky's top returning scorer who managed just 11 points through two games. He went on to post a season-high 10 points by halftime before scoring 15 more after the break. He finished 9 of 13 from the field, including a career-best 4 of 5 from behind the arc to surpass his previous best of 22 points against Mississippi State in January.\n\n\"I just tried to be solid and try to get rebounds, get out and try to create for everybody,\" Washington said. \"Once I saw a couple go in, it opened up for me.\"\n\nHerro was just as relieved to regroup from a scoreless performance against SIU.\n\nHe went 7 of 12 with a 3-pointer to top his 14-point debut against Duke, and Kentucky shot 53 percent in the opening game of the Ohio Valley Hardwood Showcase. The Wildcats scored 31 points off 20 turnovers with 12 steals, including a career-high five by Herro.\n\n\"It was just how we practiced,\" the freshman guard said. \"After the Southern Illinois game we were focused all week on playing hard defensively and I think that just carried over to the game.\"\n\nKeldon Johnson had 12 points and 10 rebounds for Kentucky's first double-double this season. Immanuel Quickley also scored 10 for the Wildcats.\n\nConner Avants had 14 points and Filip Rebraca 13 for North Dakota (2-1), which shot 40 percent in its first meeting with the Wildcats.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nKentucky's convincing performance, perhaps overdue, should help seal another week in the top 10 \u2014 provided the Wildcats take care of VMI this weekend.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNorth Dakota: Perimeter shooting helped the Fighting Hawks make things interesting early against the Wildcats. That strong start lasted just six minutes as they were thoroughly overwhelmed in their first meeting against a Southeastern Conference school. They finished 7 of 19 from 3-point range but their rebounding total was four fewer than Kentucky grabbed alone offensively.\n\n\"We got out of the gates well,\" coach Brian Jones said, \"but as the first half wore on we weren't able to take care of the basketball and that allowed them to get a little bit of separation. ... When they can rebound and run and turn you over and run, they're pretty hard to beat.\"\n\nKentucky: The Wildcats looked much better than in Friday's shaky escape against Southern Illinois. Besides shooting a season best from the field, they controlled the paint (46-18) and owned the glass 45-15. Though they were far from perfect, coach John Calipari was happy to see his team disrupt an opponent for a change.\n\n\"We still had some breakdowns and there were a couple of plays where we got scored on,\" he said. \"But I liked the fact that we turned somebody over finally.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNorth Dakota hosts Minnesota Morris on Saturday in the first of consecutive home games.\n\nKentucky hosts VMI on Sunday in the second game of the Hardwood Showcase, which also features Winthrop and Tennessee State.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: http://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nA previous version of this story incorrectly indicated Washington's seven rebounds were a career high.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins are the main men in Minnesota again, and on Wednesday night they gave the Timberwolves exactly what they needed for a big win.\n\nTowns had 25 points and 16 rebounds, Wiggins scored 23 and Minnesota improved to 2-0 since trading Jimmy Butler with a 107-100 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nJeff Teague added 14 points and 14 assists for the Timberwolves, who shipped their disgruntled star to Philadelphia this week.\n\nThe Wolves had acquired Butler in part to take some pressure off Towns and Wiggins, the talented but young faces of the franchise. Butler was a take-charge player, often dominating the ball in the fourth quarter, perhaps to the detriment of the growth of Towns and Wiggins.\n\nNow that Butler is gone after one-plus season, the Timberwolves have to find a new way to play. For two nights, at least, they seem to have figured out a formula for success.\n\n\"We were just playing together,\" Towns said. \"We did a great job getting the ball around, getting everyone involved. It was just about having fun and playing with love and enthusiasm.\"\n\nWiggins, who helped put the game away with an electrifying dunk in the final two minutes, acknowledged Butler's contributions, but also seemed to accept the higher expectations as the Wolves move forward without him.\n\n\"Whoever's on the floor has to step it up,\" Wiggins said. \"When Jimmy was here, Jimmy was a good player \u2014 that's proven. Now it's up to us to close out games.\"\n\nE'Twaun Moore scored a season-high 31 and Anthony Davis had 29 points and 11 rebounds for the Pelicans, who fell behind by 21 early in the second quarter.\n\nNew Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said he warned his team to be ready to face an opponent that was especially hungry.\n\n\"You've got prideful guys on (the Timberwolves), and they want to show the world that they're pretty good in their own right,\" Gentry said. \"I thought they were going to come out and play with that intensity level, and they did, and we did not match that.\"\n\nThe Pelicans chipped away, cutting their deficit to 13 at halftime and just four going into the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves scored the first seven points of the period to stretch their lead to 92-81, but New Orleans responded with a 15-2 run to take its first lead of the game on a 12-foot jumper by Jrue Holiday.\n\nWiggins' 3-pointer put the Wolves back on top and Towns followed with a three-point play to give Minnesota some breathing room.\n\nThen with 2 minutes to go, Towns made the play of the game. Playing with five fouls, he blocked Davis' layup attempt and fed Wiggins on the other end for a thunderous dunk. Wiggins was fouled as well, and his free throw put Minnesota up 105-98.\n\n\"You can't worry about five fouls with the game in the balance,\" Towns said. \"You've got to find a way to not foul, have good fundamentals, but also find a way to make stops and make plays.\"\n\nIt was exactly what Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau had in mind as he envisioned his two former No. 1 picks leading the Wolves into the future.\n\n\"Those are tough plays. Those are winning plays,\" Thibodeau said. \"I want them to continue to grow. There's a challenge for them to continue to get better. We talked about, one game doesn't mean you have it all figured out. Just come in tomorrow, be hungry to improve, and then be ready to play.\"\n\nWELCOME TO TOWN\n\nThe game was Minnesota's first with forwards Robert Covington and Dario Saric, who came over from Philadelphia with injured guard Jerryd Bayless in the Butler trade.\n\nThe deal was completed Monday, meaning Covington and Saric did not join their new teammates in time for the Timberwolves' 120-113 victory over Brooklyn that night.\n\nCovington started Wednesday, scoring 13 points and grabbing seven rebounds. He drained a pair of long, catch-and-shoot 3s in the third quarter as the Timberwolves were trying to hold off the Pelicans' comeback. He also chipped in two steals and a blocked shot.\n\n\"Rob is amazing on defense \u2014 he's everywhere,\" said Wiggins, who praised both his new teammates. \"They fit in perfectly.\"\n\nSaric came off the bench to contribute nine points and three boards in 20 minutes.\n\n\"The last few days feel very short to me, but at the end of the day, this is basketball,\" Saric said. \"It was very pleasurable to be on the court. We played team basketball. I think we had 29 assists \u2014 that's a pretty good number. It's just the beginning. I hope we still continue to play like this every game.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPelicans: C Nikola Mirotic returned after missing two games with a right ankle sprain. He had 16 points and 10 boards. ... Gentry said point guard Elfrid Payton is close to returning from his own right ankle sprain, but he sat out his ninth straight game.\n\nTimberwolves: The win was Minnesota's fifth straight against New Orleans. ...

Utah State had no answer as Oregon spread the ball around and attacked them around the basket and on the perimeter. Five different players scored in double figures for the Ducks and seven players shot better than 50 percent from the field.\n\nUtah State: After an upset victory over Washington State in their season opener, the Aggies fell against one of the nation's best teams. Utah State gave itself chances on defense to close the gap in the first half, but the Aggies lacked the scoring punch needed to keep up with Oregon when it mattered most.\n\nCLEAN OFFENSE\n\nOregon finished with 17 assists on 30 baskets while only committing 10 turnovers. The Ducks were ranked fifth among NCAA Division I teams entering the game in assist to turnover ratio. They are averaging 20 assists per game and committing just 9.7 turnovers per contest.\n\nPACKED SLATE\n\nUtah State is testing itself with a tough November schedule that features four Pac-12 opponents.

(AP) \u2014 Indiana coach Archie Miller challenged his defense to play with the same intensity and passion they showed last week.\n\nThe encore performance was even better.\n\nThe Hoosiers dominated one of the nation's most potent offenses by forcing a string of early turnovers, drawing fouls and converting miscues into points in a 96-73 blowout over No. 24 Marquette on Wednesday night.\n\n\"They stepped up in a big-time game on an unbelievable stage,\" Miller said. \"I was just really proud of the approach, the intensity level to start the game. It was a tough-minded, confident team tonight.\"\n\nIt went just the way Miller had hoped. After giving up 90 points combined in last week's first two victories, Indiana (3-0) demonstrated it was no fluke.\n\nThe Hoosiers limited Marquette to 42.4 percent shooting from the field and 5 of 21 on 3-pointers. They forced 14 turnovers and never let the Golden Eagles (2-1) get closer than 18 after scoring the first seven points of the second half.\n\nFive Indiana players scored in double figures, led by Romeo Langford with 22 and Evan Fitzner with 16.\n\nBut the most impressive performance came from freshman point guard Rob Phinisee, who had 12 points and eight assists and held Markus Howard in check most of the night.\n\n\"He's a stud,\" Miller said, referring to Phinisee. \"There's not much to say. Twenty-six minutes, 12 points, eight assists, one turnover and he guarded maybe the Big East Player of the Year and held his own. He's everything we knew we had when he recruited him. It's just hard to imagine he's as good and as sturdy as he is this early in his career.\"\n\nHoward scored half of his 18 points after the outcome already had been decided. Sam and Joey Hauser each scored 18, but they didn't get nearly enough help in a game that was never close.\n\nThe Hoosiers took advantage of four turnovers in the first 2\u00bd minutes by jumping to a 19-4 lead. Marquette never got closer than seven the rest of the night, and Indiana sealed the victory by scoring the final five points of the first half and the first seven of the second half to make it 54-34.\n\n\"Obviously it's not what you want but sometimes you need it to happen in order to understand how to prepare for a game like this,\" Sam Hauser said. \"We're going to take this and we're going to get better.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMarquette: The Golden Eagles climbed into the Top 25 after two impressive wins but will likely fall out after a slow start doomed any chance they had at Indiana.\n\nIndiana: If anyone doubted the Hoosiers' performance against two small-school opponents last week, they shouldn't now. Indiana looked every bit as efficient offensively, as effective defensively and as overwhelming overall against an NCAA Tournament hopeful.\n\nSTAT PACK\n\nMarquette: The Golden Eagles only led once, 2-0. ... Jamal Cain had a team-high seven rebounds and Howard had four of the Golden Eagles' eight assists. ... It was Marquette's appearance in Assembly Hall since 1985.\n\nIndiana: Juwan Morgan and Aljami Durham each scored 13 points. Morgan also had eight rebounds. ... Miller improved to 2-7 against ranked opponents in two seasons with the Hoosiers. ... Indiana shot 63.6 percent from the field \u2014 the best percentage since Miller took the job. ... Indiana had a 50-32 scoring advantage in the paint and a 21-5 edge in fast-break points, improving to 3-0 for the eighth time in nine years.\n\nTHEY SAID IT\n\nMarquette: \"They made things difficult for me at the start of the game, but I've got to handle that a lot better,\" Howard said.\n\nIndiana: \"The first 10 minutes, I thought we were really dialed in on defense and made a lot of plays that led to offense,\" Miller said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarquette hopes to rebound from its first loss when it hosts Presbyterian on Saturday.\n\nIndiana can start 4-0 for the first time since 2014-15 with a win at Arkansas on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Huh) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The game puck for his first NHL win meant something to Jeremy Colliton.\n\nThe relief for his players meant a lot more.\n\nColliton got his first victory as an NHL coach when Corey Crawford made 28 saves to help the Chicago Blackhawks beat the St. Louis Blues 1-0 on Wednesday night, stopping an eight-game losing streak.\n\n\"This group needed some good things to happen,\" Colliton said. \"They needed it. They need some reinforcement that the sun's coming up on this.\"\n\nChicago's slide began with a 7-3 loss at St. Louis on Oct. 27, and the 33-year-old Colliton took over after Joel Quenneville was fired on Nov. 6. The Blackhawks then dropped his first three games behind the bench before shutting down the Blues in the opener of a three-game homestand.\n\nThe Blackhawks celebrated by presenting Colliton with a game puck in honor of his milestone win, and then looked forward to adding to his total.\n\n\"It's been fun to play for him so far and we know he's going to have a lot more coming,\" captain Jonathan Toews said.\n\nSt. Louis lost its second straight game after winning four of five. The Blues also dropped to 1-3-0 against the Blackhawks with one game left in the season series on April 3.\n\n\"We had some opportunities,\" coach Mike Yeo said. \"I thought we had some real good looks tonight that we didn't capitalize on, whether missing the net or just not converting.\"\n\nIt was Crawford's first shutout in more than a year and No. 24 for his career. He missed most of last year and the start of this season because of a concussion.\n\nChicago got the game's only goal after St. Louis star Vladimir Tarasenko was penalized for hooking in the second period. Toews set up Brent Seabrook for an open look that was stopped by Jake Allen, but Blues defenseman Jay Bouwmeester kicked it into the net at 4:05.\n\n\"That's hockey,\" Allen said. \"It's a break, but we had our chances to capitalize and we couldn't tonight.\"\n\nAllen was pulled for an extra attacker with 1:14 remaining, and Crawford turned away David Perron's drive to the net with about 18 seconds left.\n\n\"We're feeling good right now,\" Crawford said. \"We're getting used to the systems and playing better with it. We're all on the same page, it seemed like, tonight, and we've got to carry it over.\"\n\nAllen finished with 18 saves in the opener of a three-game trip. St. Louis center Ryan O'Reilly lost a 10-game point streak.\n\nDefenseman Colton Parayko had the best scoring opportunity for the Blues, banging a shot off the inside of the left post in the second. Tarasenko also was denied by Crawford on a 2-on-1 opportunity during a mostly dull opening period.\n\nNOTES: Blues C Brayden Schenn missed his fourth consecutive game with an upper-body injury. ...

Bickerstaff said. \"To do what we did here speaks to that.\"\n\nAfter losing a 15-point lead in the third quarter, Memphis surged ahead again late and held on with key baskets from Conley.\n\nWith the shot clock winding down, Conley hit a turnaround jumper in the middle of the lane for a 113-109 lead with 26 seconds left.\n\nConley also hit two foul shots with 9.9 seconds left for a four-point lead, though Shelvin Mack went 1 of 2 at the line with 2.1 seconds left to give the Bucks one last chance trailing by three.\n\nThe Bucks inbounded the ball to their best 3-point shooter, Khris Middleton. He missed near the top of the arc with two defenders in his face as time expired.\n\n\"Stops. Stops. Stops. Finding a way to stop them,\" Gasol said in describing Memphis' final run.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo scored 31 points, and Middleton added 25 for the Bucks. They squandered an eight-point lead with 9:08 left.\n\nOne of the NBA's most prolific 3-point shooting teams, Milwaukee couldn't overcome a cold-shooting night from the arc. They shot 50.6 percent overall but just 25.7 percent from 3-point territory (9 of 35).\n\nThe Bucks came out sluggish coming off of a four-stop, Western Conference road trip, having also trailed by 11 in the first half.\n\n\"I felt like we could play with more energy, we could be better executing,\" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said.\n\nIT'S PAT\n\nMack added 15 points, including three 3s in a third quarter in which Memphis led by as much as 15.\n\nThe Bucks got back in it with a 19-2 run spearheaded by defense and energetic guard Pat Connaughton, who had 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting and added six rebounds.\n\nConnaughton opened the fourth quarter with a dunk , and Eric Bledsoe followed with a steal and dunk on the break to tie the game at 84 apiece.\n\nIt looked like the Bucks were off to the races again, playing their kind of pace. Memphis mustered enough defense late to hold off another charge.\n\n\"One thing we can do is defend when shots aren't falling,\" Connaughton said.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nGrizzlies: The win snapped a 16-game road losing streak against Eastern Conference foes. ... Down five players because of injuries, Memphis still enjoyed a pace in the first half that catered to its grind-it-out style. Gasol had 11 points to pace the Grizzlies' to a 48-45 halftime lead. It helped, too, that the Bucks were just 4 of 23 (17 percent) from the arc in the first half. Bickerstaff said the injuries haven't prevented the team from playing the kind of kind of slow-down, defensive style that he is trying to instill.\n\n\"The thought is can you make people uncomfortable and make them fight a fight they aren't accustomed to,\" Bickerstaff said.\n\nBucks: Rookie G Donte DiVincenzo left the game with left knee soreness. He played six minutes in the first half, scoring three points. ... The Bucks wasted an opportunity to go 11-3, which would have matched their best start since 1980-81. ... Budenholzer was ejected in the fourth quarter after picking up his second technical foul.\n\nThe ejection occurred after it appeared the Budenholzer was arguing about a call in which Malcolm Brogdon stepped out of bounds. The guard might have been pushed out of bounds by a defender. Asked if he was surprised that he got ejected, Budenholzer said \"It's a good question.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGrizzlies: Return home Friday night to face the Sacramento Kings\n\nBucks: Host the Chicago Bulls on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I was just proud of the way we came back and responded.\"\n\nCasey raised his arms in triumph, pumped his fist, then ran onto the court to celebrate with his team after Bullock's tiebreaking basket in the lane.\n\n\"It was obviously good to be able to see a coach come from the other end of the court and celebrate with his players,\" Bullock said.\n\nKawhi Leonard scored 26 points and Pascal Siakam and Greg Monroe each had 17 for the Raptors, who have lost consecutive home games after a 7-0 start. Toronto (12-3) also failed to match the best start in franchise history. The Raptors went 13-2 to begin the 2014-15 season.\n\nRaptors guard Kyle Lowry, who blossomed under Casey's leadership, was left fuming afterward about multiple Toronto miscues, including a blown coverage on the final play.\n\n\"It's a good win for him,\" Lowry said. \"I'm sure he's happy, but we're not happy. I'm not happy for him. We should have won the game.\"\n\nToronto had won six straight over the Pistons, and nine of the previous 11 meetings.\n\nDetroit trailed 88-77 to begin the fourth but took its first lead since the opening quarter, 98-97, on a jump shot by Jackson with 4:54 remaining.\n\nLeonard tied it at 104 by making a jumper with 38 seconds to go. Griffin missed a jumper at the other end and Lowry grabbed the rebound, giving Toronto 10 seconds to try a go-ahead shot. Leonard brought the ball up but lost it out of bounds with 2 seconds to go.\n\nAfter Siakam blocked Glenn Robinson's shot out of bounds, Detroit took the ball under the basket with 1.2 seconds left. Jose Calderon inbounded to a cutting Bullock, who won it with his buzzer-beater.\n\n\"I was pretty much butt-naked under the basket,\" Bullock said. \"I got the ball and just floated it.\"\n\nMonroe played a season-high 21 minutes because starting center Serge Ibaka sat out with a sore right knee. Jonas Valanciunas started in his place.\n\nThe Raptors lost another starter when guard Danny Green left with a sore lower back in the third quarter. He did not return.\n\nToronto coach Nick Nurse expects Ibaka to return Friday at Boston, but said Green's status is unknown.\n\nFans stood and cheered when Casey was introduced before the game, and roared in approval when a video tribute was shown during the first timeout. Players from both benches also stood and applauded as Casey acknowledged the crowd with a wave.\n\n\"He was drawing up a play,\" Griffin said. \"They had finished the video, everybody started clapping. I was watching the video, and the play. He was about to go over it again and I was like, 'Coach, you've got to stand up. You deserve that.'\"\n\nCasey went 320-238 in seven seasons with the Raptors, more wins than any other coach in franchise history. He was selected NBA Coach of the Year after Toronto set a team record with 59 wins last season, but had been fired by the time he received the award. Casey was let go after the Raptors were swept in the second round of the playoffs by Cleveland, their third straight postseason defeat at the hands of the Cavaliers.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPistons: Calderon spent parts of eight seasons with the Raptors and is the franchise leader in assists (3,770). . This was the sixth time a Detroit game was decided by three or fewer points, tied with Chicago for most in the NBA.\n\nRaptors: F C.J. Miles, who left Monday's loss to New Orleans because of a strained right adductor, was inactive. There is no timetable for his return. ... For the second straight game, the Raptors missed nine of their first 10 attempts from 3-point range. They finished 4 for 20.\n\nCONFIDENCE IN COACH\n\nGriffin said he wasn't surprised at Casey's ability to draw up two late-game plays. Casey was not considered strong at in-game play-calling during his Toronto tenure.\n\n\"It isn't like we just discovered this for the first time today,\" Griffin said. \"Maybe to Toronto fans or certainly their GM, maybe it was a surprise, but not to us.\"\n\nWEAK FINISH\n\nToronto had eight turnovers in the fourth and scored 16 points, its fewest in any quarter this season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPistons: Host Cleveland on Monday night.\n\nRaptors: At Boston on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Reinhold Matay, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt's just one game, but the Jimmy Butler era got off to a dispiriting start for the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nButler made his debut for Philadelphia on Wednesday amid high expectations, but the Orlando Magic showed what a work in progress the new-look 76ers will be. Orlando rallied from 16 points down for a 111-106 victory in which Butler took just two shots in a scoreless fourth quarter.\n\nAcquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves in a blockbuster trade that became official on Monday, Butler finished with 14 points on 6-of-12 shooting with four rebounds and two assists. However, he made little impact late as the Magic used a 21-0 run in the fourth to retake the lead and closed on an 11-2 run for the win.\n\n\"We're going to be just fine because once we put this together, we're going to be tough,\" Butler said.\n\n\"A lot has been going on, but that's no excuse for not winning,\" he added. \"No matter what, we're expected to win. I'm expecting to win, and we're expecting to win as a team. So that isnt an excuse.\"\n\nJoel Embiid put the 76ers up 92-76 with a 3-pointer at the 10:51 mark of the fourth. The Magic scored eight straight before Butler re-entered the game. He missed a 17-foot jumper shortly after, then didn't take another shot until the closing seconds when the result was essentially decided.\n\n\"You don't just click your heels and win NBA games. We will use this as a way to remind everyone that this is the NBA,\" said 76ers coach Brett Brown.\n\nAs the 76ers went cold and missed everything for nearly four minutes, the Magic made seven straight shots from the field in their 21-0 burst to take a 97-92 lead. After trading a handful of ties and leads changes, Terrence Ross hit a tough 3 over Embiid and Mike Muscala to put Orlando ahead 109-106 with 8.7 seconds left.\n\nMORE NBA\n\nBREAKDOWN: What the Butler trade means for Philadelphia in the East\n\nHISTORY: LeBron passes Wilt for fifth place on NBA all-time scoring list\n\nTURMOIL?

But we've got a lot more of these things.,\" Butler said. \"I think we'll all be better, myself included. We've got another on Friday.\"\n\nEmbiid notched his first career triple-double with 19 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. The big man was 4-of-7 from 3-point range, but struggled shooting overall and finished 6-of-20 from the field, including 1-of-6 in the fourth quarter.\n\nButler was introduced last among 76ers starters during the pregame festivities and got off to a solid start. He hit his first three shots from the field and a pair of free throws for eights points in eight minutes during the first quarter.\n\nButler's first bucket came on a pretty backdoor cut and dish from Embiid just over two minutes into the game.\n\n\"I feel like, although we lost, the organization of the tiny few things we put in, put us in decent position,\" Brown said. \"But I see tremendous promise, and a tremendous fit from Jimmy into our system.\"\n\nFollow Matt Eppers on Twitter @meppers_."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Andy Nesbitt", "title": "Dwane Casey's first trip back to Toronto ended with a buzzer-beater and him going nuts", "description": "What a way to get revenge.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/dwane-caseys-first-trip-back-to-toronto-ended-with-a-buzzer-beater-and-him-going-nuts", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/usp-nba_-detroit-pistons-at-toronto-raptors.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T03:34:55Z", "content": "Dwane Casey is in his first season as head coach of the Detroit Pistons.

(AP) \u2014 Oklahoma State was still feeling the effects of a disastrous collapse in their season opener on Saturday, but eventually rebounded with a strong performance.\n\nCam McGriff scored 20 points and had 10 rebounds to help lead the Cowboys to an 82-60 victory over UTSA Wednesday night.\n\nThomas Dziagwa had 16 points and six rebounds while Lindy Waters added 14 points, seven rebounds and a game-high six assists, as Oklahoma State (1-1) won its 43rd consecutive home opener.\n\n\"There are no bad wins, that's for sure,\" said Cowboys coach Mike Boynton. \"We learned how delicate the line is between winning and losing on Saturday, so we're certainly going to enjoy this accomplishment. It wasn't always pretty, but I thought we did a lot of positive things, things to build on. There were also some things that we can learn from and try to improve on.\"\n\nByron Frohnen led UTSA (0-3) with 11 points, nine rebounds and five steals, while Adokiye Iyaye had 10 points. After committing 19 and 20 turnovers in their first two games, the Roadrunners had 18 in this one.\n\n\"We opened the game pretty sharp, we were attacking, made good, simple plays, we played pretty hard defensively to start, then they just turned it completely on us,\" said UTSA coach Steve Henson. \"It's kind of the same story \u2014 turnovers are killing us, perimeter shooting has been a struggle for us right now and because of that, it affects our defense a little bit.\"\n\nIt was a nice bounce-back performance for Oklahoma State after allowing Charlotte to erase a 24-point Cowboy lead over the final 14 minutes on Saturday, including a game-clinching 3-pointer with 0.6 seconds remaining.\n\nOklahoma State, which has nine newcomers on the roster, including six freshmen, fell behind 9-0 and 13-3 early, but eventually found its confidence. The Cowboys built a 14-point advantage late in the first half, then saw it dwindle to just four early in the second, but responded with a game-changing 18-1 run that put them ahead 56-35 with 11:34 remaining.\n\n\"I felt like we were still affected psychologically from the game the other day,\" Boynton said of the early deficit. \"That thing had kind of had a lingering effect even in practice a little bit. It was just psychologically getting over that, putting it behind them. I'm glad we were able to get going.\"\n\nThe Cowboys led 61-41 after Maurice Calloo's basket with 8:45 to go and UTSA scored the next five points to make the OSU crowd a bit nervous, but Oklahoma State answered with a 10-2 run to put the game out of reach for good.\n\n\"They took it to us in the second half,\" Henson said. \"They made the run and we just couldn't respond. Our defense has got to be better to overcome rough stretches offensively.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nUTSA: The Roadrunners struggled with inconsistency throughout the contest. They looked impressive early, jumping out to an early 13-3 lead over the first five-plus minutes. The offense went dry after that, at one point late in the opening half missing nine straight shots from the floor and hitting just 1-of-13. Then, trailing 36-22 with 3:01 left in the first half, UTSA went on a 12-2 run over the next four and a half minutes, pulling to within four just 1:24 into the second half. That was followed by another stretch where they were outscored 18-1 and missed seven consecutive shots.\n\nOklahoma State: Considering how their previous game ended, with the Cowboys shooting just 2-for-20 from the floor, including 0-for-8 from 3-point range, over the final 14 minutes of the Charlotte game, there was some restlessness in the building when the Cowboys started so poorly, missing their first nine shots from the floor and three of their first four free throw attempts. But Oklahoma State bounced back, rattling off a 14-3 run over the next five minutes to take the lead on Waters' 3-pointer with 11:24 left in the opening half. From there, the Cowboys continued to build their advantage and looked pretty solid.\n\nYOUTH IS SERVED\n\nOklahoma State started two freshmen, forward Yor Anei and Isaac Likekele, and had four other true frosh play at least seven minutes of action in reserve. Calloo and Duncan Demuth each earned over 20 minutes of floor time. \"Playing six freshmen isn't easy on your stress levels as a coach, but it's who we are,\" Boynton said. \"We're a young team and those kids have earned the opportunity to learn in these situations.\"\n\nSTAT OF THE NIGHT\n\nBoth teams struggled on free throws. Despite the victory, Oklahoma State shot just 50 percent (10 of 20) from the line, with McGriff hitting just 2 of 4, and Demuth missing all four of his attempts. UTSA wasn't much better, starting 4 of 9 before finishing 13 of 21 (62 percent) for the night. \"We got to do better,\" Boynton said. \"We've got guys who are very capable.

(AP Photo/Alonzo Adams) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Paul George is feeling well \u2014 and found his shooting touch.\n\nThe All-Star forward scored a season-high 35 points to help the Oklahoma City Thunder rout the New York Knicks 128-103 on Wednesday night.\n\nGeorge made 13 of 22 shots, including 5 of 11 3-pointers. He was coming off a 32-point performance on Monday night against Phoenix during which he made 11 of 19 shots and 6 of 10 threes.\n\n\"My body has just been feeling good,\" he said. \"I've kind of played myself into good shape from a body standpoint. If I can just find open looks like that, I feel comfortable taking them.\"\n\nKnicks coach David Fizdale has seen this from George before. Fizdale was an assistant coach for Miami when George was with the Indiana Pacers, one of the top roadblocks to the Heat's championship runs.\n\n\"There was just times where we were under his shirt and he was just letting that thing go from deep,\" Fizdale said. \"We tried to trap him some. ... I felt that pain from him when I've had my best teams. This guy's a big-time player. When he gets it going like that, he's tough.\"\n\nSteven Adams had 19 points and seven rebounds, and Dennis Schroder added 15 points and 12 assists for the Thunder. They have won nine of 10 since an 0-4 start, and improved to 4-1 since point guard Russell Westbrook was sidelined with a sprained left ankle. The Thunder matched their second-best scoring output of the season and posted their largest victory margin.\n\nTim Hardaway, Jr. scored 20 points, and Enes Kanter added 19 for the Knicks.\n\nGeorge scored 18 points in the first half and Adams added 15 to help the Thunder take a 65-49 lead. Oklahoma City shot 56.5 percent from the field before the break.\n\nThe Thunder put the game out of reach in the third quarter. Adams threaded the needle to find a cutting Patrick Patterson for a dunk, then Patterson lobbed to George for a jam that put Oklahoma City ahead 85-61. George scored 17 points in the third quarter, and the Thunder led 100-80 at the end of the period.\n\nFizdale said it was a learning experience for his young squad.\n\n\"We have a microcosm of how I'd like our guys to play,\" Fizdale said. \"Fast, athletic, disruptive.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nKnicks: Kanter, who played for the Thunder for two seasons and part of another, got a warm reception from the fans when he checked in as a reserve. ... Rookie F Kevin Knox scored 15 points on 5-of-16 shooting.\n\nThunder: Shot 65.2 percent in the first quarter to take a 37-22 lead. ... It was Oklahoma City's first time wearing its City Edition uniforms, which pay homage to Oklahoma's Native American heritage by incorporating elements of the state's tribal nations. ... Adams matched a career high with five assists. ... F Jerami Grant scored 15 points. ... Rookie reserve Hamidou Diallo scored 11 points.\n\nADAMS TALKS TRASH\n\nAdams and Kanter were best friends in Oklahoma City. They talked trash throughout the game, with Adams even suggesting Fizdale should take Kanter out.\n\nAdams said he said it because he respects Kanter.\n\n\"Yeah, I was trying to discourage him because he's a bloody good player,\" Adams said. \"It's best to have him off the floor for us.\"\n\nTHUNDER DEFENSE\n\nSince Westbrook's injury, the Thunder have held opponents to 96.2 points per game. For perspective, every team in the league entered Wednesday's action averaging at least 101.2 points per game.\n\nSCHRODER STEPS UP\n\nSchroder has been a star in Westbrook's absence, averaging 19.2 points and 5.8 assists.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nKnicks: At New Orleans on Friday night.\n\nThunder: At Phoenix on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

After a slow start through the first quarter, Boston started pulling away from the Bulls in the second quarter and never let up.\n\n\"Once we hit a couple shots, I thought we felt a lot better about ourselves,\" coach Brad Stevens said.\n\nGordon Hayward scored 11 and Al Horford had 10 points and eight rebounds as all five Boston starters reached double figures.\n\nThe Celtics capitalized on 22 turnovers by the Bulls, who dropped their second straight and third in four games.\n\n\"They came out and hit us in the mouth in the second quarter,\" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. \"A huge thing in this league is, find a way to fight through adversity and play through tough times, and we obviously did not do that well tonight.\"\n\nJabari Parker scored 14 in the first quarter for the Bulls, but was shut out the rest of the way.\n\nShaquille Harrison led Chicago with 16 points. Zach LaVine had 10 points and nine assists, and Wendell Carter Jr. added 11 points and seven rebounds.\n\n\"We just weren't scoring the ball,\" LaVine said. \"We were playing really good defense, but the flood gates opened up and we couldn't respond.\"\n\nThe Celtics dominated the second quarter, holding Chicago to 11 points on five field goals, and continued to pull away in the second half. They held a 22-point lead entering the fourth quarter and emptied their bench. The reserves stretched the advantage to 33 before it was over.\n\nTerry Rozier had 12 points for Boston, and Aaron Baynes finished with nine points and 11 rebounds.\n\nAfter going 9 for 23 in the first quarter, the Celtics outscored Chicago 32-11 in the second and forced the Bulls into seven turnovers.\n\nRozier's free throw after a technical foul on LaVine broke a 28-all tie and started Boston on a 12-0 run. The Celtics shut out the Bulls for 5:14 while pulling ahead 42-30, then closed the period on a 9-2 spurt for a 51-35 halftime lead.\n\nBaynes opened the fourth quarter for Boston with a 3-pointer and added a three-point play with 9:46 remaining to extend the margin to 87-64.\n\nHayward followed with a jumper, then converted another three-point play as the Celtics opened a 92-64 bulge with 9:32 left.\n\nTIGHT D\n\nThe Celtics made a season-high 12 steals, led by Hayward's three, and blocked five shots. Chicago's 82 points marked the lowest total allowed by Boston this season.\n\n\"We were prepared. I think that we've been prepared other games but we've got to match that with the attitude and effort to execute on both ends,\" Irving said.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nBulls: F Lauri Markkanen (right elbow sprain) is still a few weeks out from playing for the first time this season, Hoiberg said. \"Lauri was able to increase his activity today and did not have any pain after, which is a great sign. Still same timeline \u2014 a couple weeks away,\" Hoiberg explained.\n\nCeltics: F Marcus Morris sat out with an illness, missing his first game of the season. Morris came off the bench in the first 13 games and is fourth on the team in scoring at 11.8 points per game. \"We're better with Marcus. There's no question about that. We want him back ASAP,\" Stevens said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Bulls visit Milwaukee on Friday night.\n\nThe Celtics host Toronto on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They led 10-2 less than five minutes in and expanded the lead to 22-8 on Matthews' jumper midway through the opening half. A 17-3 run followed, giving Michigan a 39-13 lead.

Ward went down and pounded the court with both fists. He got up on his own and hobbled off the court, trying to keep weight off his right leg.

Horace Spencer had career-highs with 14 points and 17 rebounds. Samir Doughty scored 13, Jared Harper 12 and Malik Dunbar 10.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 Wiley dominated a team that didn't have a starter taller than 6-5. He scored six straight points after coming off the bench in the first half, making 5 of 7 shots and 8 of 10 free-throw attempts. Wiley, who collected seven rebounds, had played only 13 minutes in the last game against Washington after missing the opener with a foot injury.\n\nHe did his damage in this one in just 16 minutes.\n\n\"It was good to give him the ball, get him moving, shake some of that rust off,\" Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said.\n\nBrandon Boston led the Choctaws with nine points and 10 rebounds. Marcus Lytle and Donovan Ham each had eight. Lytle had seven quick points during the brief second-half rally, and the Choctaws scored the final seven.\n\nMississippi College coach Don Lofton aggravated a hip injury on the bus before the game. He listened to the game on the radio from the locker room while assistant Erik Ainsworth ran the team.\n\n\"I'd have been in the way if I came out there,\" Lofton said after coming out of the locker room on crutches.\n\nAuburn jumped ahead 25-2 over the first 10 minutes, but Mississippi College answered with eight straight points.\n\nBoston's off-balance 3-pointer at the buzzer cut it to 48-29 at halftime.\n\nAuburn's Chuma Okeke, the reigning Southeastern Conference player of the week, didn't score in the first half. He had three points and seven rebounds.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMississippi College: Dropped its second straight to a team from Alabama, including an 88-84 overtime defeat to Talladega.\n\nAuburn: Has just its third 3-0 start in the last 12 years, with three straight lopsided wins.

He could return this season from what appeared to be a severe injury when he was hurt Monday, but it could be a rough road without him for the Nets if Wednesday's game was any indication.\n\n\"I mean, obviously it's tough in the fashion that it happened,\" Nets forward Joe Harris said.\n\n\"Just the significance of how the injury happened, him being the heart and soul of the team up until this point, our go-to scorer and facilitator. Then obviously just the energy and enthusiasm and leadership that he brings, that's a void we miss a lot and it is going to be an adjustment for us.\"\n\nBrooklyn was also without starting center Jarrett Allen again because of an illness.\n\nMiami had yielded 116.7 points in its last three games but Spoelstra said before the game the Heat weren't as far away defensively as they looked during the skid, noting they had the league's sixth-ranked defense after beating San Antonio before it started.\n\nDragic said the Heat had a meeting to refocus and they were quickly locked in again, limiting the Nets to 6-for-24 shooting in the first quarter. Miami made 62.5 percent of its shots on the other end and led 37-21.\n\nThe Nets shot 40 percent overall, but the Heat held them in the mid-30s through three quarters, when the game was decided.\n\n\"When you play tough, feels like you've got more confidence defensively and then when you don't put pressure on defense, the offense just flows,\" Dragic said. \"So we feel like everybody battled. We were the more aggressive team tonight.\"\n\nJohnson shot 9 for 12 against the team that signed him to a $50 million offer sheet two summers ago, but the Heat held onto the guard by matching the deal.\n\nMiami led 90-72 lead after three. The Nets did finally cobble together enough offense to briefly get within single digits in the fourth.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHeat: Longtime Heat forward Udonis Haslem got into a game for just the second time this season, playing two minutes and making his first field goal of the season. ... Richardson played in his 200th career game.\n\nNets: Allen Crabbe, a starter last season who has struggled offensively coming off the bench thus far, was in the lineup in LeVert's spot but fouled out with just six points. ... Brooklyn had won the last three meetings and its only loss to Miami last season came in Mexico City.\n\nROLLER-COASTER RIDE\n\nNets coach Kenny Atkinson and general manager Sean Marks both talked about the range of emotions that started with seeing LeVert going down in Minnesota with his leg bent awkwardly and taken off to a stretcher, to getting the positive diagnosis of no fractures, no surgery necessary and a potential return this season the following day. Marks wouldn't put a timetable on a possible return, but the Nets were happy there was even hope of one so soon.\n\n\"I'm obviously definitely no doctor, but I think from the optics standpoint, when you see something like that, that's pretty gruesome, you're fearing the worst unfortunately,\" Marks said. \"And then you when you get the results, look, he's going to bounce back and that's terrific.\"\n\nSEE YOU SOON\n\nThe teams meet again next Tuesday in Miami, where the Nets were 2-0 last season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHeat: Visit Indiana on Friday.\n\nNets: Visit Washington on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Everything about Jimmy Butler's first game with the 76ers was going great, until the fourth quarter.\n\nButler had 14 points in his Philadelphia debut, but the 76ers collapsed late and lost to Orlando 111-106 after Terrence Ross hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 8.7 seconds left that helped the Magic finish off a big comeback Wednesday night.\n\n\"We're going to be just fine because once we put this together, we're going to be tough,\" said Butler, acquired Monday from Minnesota in a five-player swap.\n\nThe four-time All-Star played 33 minutes and shot 6 for 12 from the field after a couple of days spent adjusting to the big trade.\n\n\"A lot has been going on, but that's no excuse for not winning,\" he said. \"No matter what, we're expected to win. I'm expecting to win, and we're expecting to win as a team. So that isn't an excuse.\"\n\nOrlando scored 21 straight points in the fourth quarter, then held the 76ers without a field goal over the final 3 1/2 minutes.\n\n\"You don't just click your heels and win NBA games. We will use this as a way to remind everyone that this is the NBA,\" said 76ers coach Brett Brown. \"Although we lost, the organization of the things we put in put us in decent position. If we can get three shots (in the final minute) instead of three turnovers, maybe we're talking to each other about a win.\"\n\nNikola Vucevic had 30 points for the Magic, including two clinching free throws with 5.8 seconds remaining.\n\n\"They just made a big trade and we knew they were probably going to be very fired up to come in and play well,\" said Vucevic, who scored 11 in the fourth quarter. \"We stayed poised for 48 minutes. We got down 16 and we kept fighting. Getting stops was the big thing.\"\n\nJoel Embiid finished with a triple-double of 19 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists for the 76ers, who lost for the seventh time in nine road games. J.J. Redick led Philadelphia with 22 points but committed two turnovers in the final 31 seconds.\n\nVucevic had 19 points in the first half to help Orlando come back from a 10-point deficit and lead 53-52 at the break.\n\nTwo baskets by Redick during a 10-2 run early in the third quarter put Philadelphia up 62-60. Embiid then made a play that turned the game sharply in the 76ers' favor for a while. After having the ball stolen from him by Magic forward Wes Iwundu, the 7-footer chased Iwundu down the court and blocked his layup attempt from behind.\n\nPhiladelphia led 92-76 before the Magic scored 21 consecutive points.\n\nThe 76ers made only seven of 18 shots in the fourth quarter. But the big number, according to Magic coach Steve Clifford, was free throws: 12 for Orlando, two for Philadelphia.\n\n\"It's been an area of weakness, and then tonight in the fourth quarter we didn't foul,\" Clifford said. \"Keeping the other team out of the bonus is a big deal, and in the fourth quarter it's even a bigger deal.\"\n\nWilson Chandler ended the 76ers' scoreless stretch of more than four minutes with a short baseline floater. Mike Muscala hit a 3-pointer for their final field goal with 3:33 remaining.\n\nBIG-TIME BLOCK\n\nAfter missing six games with a right ankle sprain, Jonathan Isaac played 16 quiet minutes except for one very loud play \u2014 a rejection of Embiid's dunk attempt, high above the rim, right in the middle of the Magic's 21-0 spurt. \"That was pretty much the play of the game \u2014 just the challenge alone,\" Orlando forward Aaron Gordon said. \"It takes a lot of courage to go up there and block somebody coming down the lane like that.\n\nSaid Isaac: \"It felt fantastic.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\n76ers: Embiid made all three of his 3-pointers in the first 4:09 of the game. ... Ben Simmons is 23 for 28 (.821) from the foul line at home, and 22 for 44 (.500) on the road.\n\nMagic: Ross has converted 12 of 18 shots from 3-point range in the last three games. ...

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 James Palmer couldn't make a shot the first 16 minutes against Seton Hall. He couldn't seem to miss the next 24.\n\nNebraska's All-Big Ten guard overcame his cold start to score 29 points, including a huge 3-pointer after Seton Hall pulled close in the second half, and the Cornhuskers pulled away for an 80-57 win Wednesday night.\n\nThe Huskers (3-0) ended a seven-game losing streak against opponents from the Big East with their dominant performance in the Gavitt Tipoff Games.\n\nThe Pirates (1-1) made just 2 of 16 3-pointers and had just three assists against 14 turnovers.\n\n\"I liked their defensive effort, I liked their stick-to-it-iveness, I like how they added to their lead,\" Nebraska coach Tim Miles said. \"It's one thing to do that at home. It's another to do it away from home. We beat a quality opponent that is well-coached and beat them handily.\"\n\nPalmer started 0 for 8 from the field. His first make came with under 4 minutes left in the first half when he hit a 3 from the top of the key. He released his frustration by pumping his right fist like he was spiking a football.\n\n\"I was just happy I finally made a shot,\" said Palmer, who made 7 of his last 12.\n\nNebraska came out sharp in the second half and built its 33-27 halftime lead to 10 points before Michael Nzei scored a quick six points to cut the lead in half. The Pirates pulled as close as 44-42 after Nebraska was assessed a bench technical for its reaction to Isaiah Roby being called for his fourth foul.\n\nThe tech seemed to inspire the Huskers. Palmer opened a 9-2 spurt with a 3-pointer, and Thomas Allen finished it with a deep shot to make it 53-44. The lead went over 20 points when Roby threw down a lob from Glynn Watson Jr. for a dunk in the final 2 minutes, and the Huskers ended the game on a 36-15 run.\n\n\"We wanted to take care of business,\" Palmer said. \"First big test. Hopefully this leads to more wins.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSeton Hall: The Pirates lost a senior class that combined for more than 5,000 points and three NCAA Tournament appearances. They are finding their way, and they'll do it against an extremely challenging nonconference schedule.\n\n\"I think you can learn a ton,\" Pirates coach Kevin Willard said. \"We'll get home, break down the tape and kind of see things that we did well. I like the way we battled, up until the 35-minute mark. I think there's a lot of things we did well and I think there's a lot of things we didn't do well and can improve on them.\"\n\nNebraska: The Huskers needed a more strenuous test, and got it, after beating Mississippi Valley State by 69 points and Southeastern Louisiana by 52.\n\nNUMBERS TO KNOW\n\nCopeland Jr. had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Watson added 14 points and eight assists for Nebraska. ...

Washington never trailed and led by as many as 27 points.\n\n\"We did a good job of coming out there very aggressive on the defensive end,\" Dwight Howard said. \"We got a lot of stops early which allowed us to get a pretty good lead.\"\n\nThe Wizards got 12 points from Austin Rivers and 11 from Markieff Morris.\n\nRookie Collin Sexton had a career-high 24 points for Cleveland, and David Nwaba added 11 points. Playing the second straight night after topping Charlotte on Tuesday, the Cavaliers are an NBA-worst 2-12.\n\nIn addition to forward Kevin Love (foot surgery), the Cavaliers were without starting point guard George Hill (hamstring), forward Sam Dekker (ankle) and forward Kyle Korver (sore right foot).\n\n\"On the second night of a back-to-back, you have to know they're going to throw their punches,\" Cavaliers forward Larry Nance, Jr. said. \"You just have to weather the storm and ride the game out, and we didn't weather storm.\"\n\nWashington pulled away with a 15-0 run early in the second quarter, and Kelly Oubre's dunk made it 56-32. They led 73-52 at halftime. Cleveland had a 13-2 run to get to 82-69 in the third, but Morris hit a 3-pointer and the Wizards scored seven straight points.\n\nCleveland committed 24 turnovers that translated into 29 Wizards points.\n\n\"This building is a tough place to play, a tough place to win, especially if you turn the ball over,\" Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said. \"And bad shots are just as bad as a turnover.\"\n\nThe Wizards made 13 of 40 3-point attempts, while Cleveland was 4 of 21 and missed 10 free throws. Cleveland's 95 points tied a season-low for a Washington opponent.\n\n\"We still have a lot of work to do - we still have to get better. We're still not content with where we are,\" Beal said. \"We put three (wins) together, but we still have a couple more at home that we have to take care of.\"\n\nUNFAMILIAR TERRITORY\n\nIn his 556th NBA game, Washington's Ian Mahinmi hit his first career 3-pointer on his 11th career attempt. With a minute left in the first half, Mahinmi took pass from John Wall and successfully launched from the right corner.\n\n\"I talked to John right before the play and he told me 'get to the corner.' So, I get to the corner, I get behind the line and I'm like, 'if the ball comes my way, I'm shooting it,'\" Mahinmi said. \"So, it happened. It went in.

(AP) \u2014 Cassius Winston gave his offensively challenged team a needed boost.\n\nWinston scored 14 of his 23 points in the opening minutes of the second half, bouncing back from a rough start to help No. 11 Michigan State beat Louisiana-Monroe 80-59 on Wednesday night.\n\nThe point guard said he had to be aggressive because \"we were struggling to get points on the board.\" Michigan State made just 28 percent of its shots overall in the first half and was even worse on 3-pointers, connecting on 2 of 19.\n\n\"I could make 2 of 19,\" coach Tom Izzo said.\n\nWinston's surge helped Michigan State lead 51-35 at the 16:52 mark after it was ahead by six points at halftime.\n\n\"Cassius is capable of that a lot,\" Izzo.\n\nWinston was 9 of 22 from the field, including 3 of 10 on 3-pointers, after going 2 of 9 overall and 0 for 5 beyond the arc in the first half.\n\n\"I didn't let the first half affect my confidence,\" he said.\n\nThe Spartans (2-1) lost Nick Ward midway through the first half with a sprained right ankle.

(AP) \u2014 Radford is closer to Tobacco Road than Notre Dame is but that didn't stop senior guard Caleb Tanner and the Highlanders from making a point to their Atlantic Coast Conference neighbors Wednesday night.\n\n\"Coming in here and beating an ACC team is huge,\" said the 6-foot-1 Tanner, who scored 20 points, 18 of them from beyond the 3-point line, as Radford moved to 3-0 with a 63-60 victory over Notre Dame.\n\nCoach Mike Jones' Highlanders, who earned an NCAA bid last March by winning the Big South Tournament, beating LIU Brooklyn in the first round before losing to eventual champ Villanova, also got a double-double from Ed Polite Jr. - 16 points and 11 rebounds - and 11 from Travis Fields Jr.\n\n\"The guys came out with the right mentality - we fought hard on the defensive end,\" Jones said. \"It's a huge accomplishment for them.\"\n\nJunior forward John Mooney had career highs in points (24) and rebounds (12) and T.J. Gibbs added 11 points for coach Mike Brey's Irish (2-1).\n\n\"I've been worried about this one for about four days because they (the Highlanders) are old and good and they're way better than us right now,\" said Brey, whose team missed the NCAA tournament last season, lost in the second round of the NIT and is rebuilding with four freshmen.\n\nTanner, who had 14 points at halftime thanks to four 3-pointers, and his teammates overcame a 34-28 halftime deficit and led by as many as six points late. The Irish had a chance to send it into overtime, but Gibbs couldn't get a shot off from mid-court as time expired.\n\n\"We never get worried,\" said Tanner, who hit 7 of 11 from the field, including 6 of 9 3-pointers. \"We're a very confident team. We love adversity so when it hits, this team rises up.\"\n\nMooney finished 8-of-16 shooting from the field, including 6 of 9 from beyond the arc. Gibbs' 11 points came on 5-of-16 shooting, including a 0-of-7 effort from long distance.\n\n\"It really doesn't (mean anything),\" Mooney said of his performance after the loss. \"We didn't get it done at the end.\"\n\nMooney was on fire from the start and ended the first half with 18 points, tying his previous best of 18 at North Carolina last Feb. 12. His start wasn't what he wanted - Mooney went up for a dunk and it was denied by Radford's Mawdo Sallah with the game scoreless less than two minutes in.\n\nTanner got going with the first of his four 3-pointers in the half, but Notre Dame pulled out to its biggest lead of the first half, 17-7, when Gibbs scored Notre Dame's first 2-pointer of the half with 10:54 remaining.\n\nTanner, who had 14 points in the first 20 minutes, later outscored the Irish 8-2 with the help of two 3-pointers to pull his team within one, 24-23, with 4:24 to play. The Irish then closed with a 10-5 run for a 34-28 lead at the intermission.\n\nThe Highlanders started the second half on a 6-1 run before Gibbs hit a jumper in the lane and Brey called a timeout with 18:05 remaining and the Irish up 37-34. But a 7-3 run after play resumed, ending with Fields' 3-pointer, gave Radford a 41-40 lead with 15:57 to play. It was the first time in three games that Notre Dame had trailed.\n\nA 7-0 Radford run, the final two on Devonnte Holland's put-back, made it 54-52 with 8:02 to play. The lead grew to six, 59-53, after Tanner's sixth 3-pointer and Brey called another timeout with 4:47 to play.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nRadford: The Highlanders were picked to win the Big South this season. Against the Irish, who were one of the last teams out of the NCAA field and are rebuilding, Radford managed just 10-of-32 shooting (31 percent) from the field. But the Highlanders turned it around in the second half, shooting a sizzling 56 percent (14 of 25) while holding Notre Dame to just 32 percent (10 of 31) in the final 20 minutes and outrebounding the Irish 41-34.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a 40-minute battle; we knew we weren't going to knock them out,\" Jones said. \"This is something we're going to feel good about. Caleb (Tanner) is not physically imposing-looking. I was proud of him stepping up in the starting lineup.\"\n\nNotre Dame: With 3:43 to go in the half, the Irish were 9-of-23 shooting from the field with only two 2-pointers. They started by hitting their first five 3-pointers - four by Mooney and another by freshman Robby Carmody. They were 8 of 18 from beyond the arc - six by Mooney (on eight tries) and one each by Carmody and D.J. Harvey, who had two 2-pointers along with Gibbs.\n\nBut Notre Dame only got 25 points from its other seven players, including 12 from three freshmen - Prentiss Hubb and Carmody had five points each, Nate Laszewski two and Dane Goodwin zero. The Irish shot 32 percent (10 of 31) in the second half, including 1 of 11 from long distance.\n\n\"William & Mary (Notre Dame's opponent Saturday) can beat us; Duquesne can beat us,\" Brey said of Notre Dame's next two opponents at home in the on-campus Gotham Classic. \"Everybody can beat us. That's who we are right now. We just have to get back to work.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRadford: Saturday at Duquesne in second of three-game road trip.\n\nNotre Dame: Saturday at home against William & Mary.\n\n____\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP-Top25\n\nhttp://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/scoreboard\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Clemson coach Brad Brownell knows he has something many other programs don't \u2014 a highly experienced backcourt to call on when things get tight.\n\nMarcquise Reed had a season-high 26 points and point guard Shelton Mitchell 13 as the 19th-ranked Tigers used a second-half surge to put away pesky Sam Houston State 74-59 on Wednesday night.\n\n\"I better enjoy this, because I don't think I'm going to have it next year,\" Brownell said. \"Those guys once again played well down the stretch.\"\n\nParticularly during a 16-3 run midway through the second half as they combined for 11 points while Clemson took control. The Tigers opened 3-0 for the second straight season and for just the fifth time in coach Brad Brownell's nine years.\n\nFor a good while, though, it seemed the Bearkats of the Southland Conference were more than up to the challenge of handling an Atlantic Coast Conference opponent.\n\nRJ Smith's 3-pointer early in the second half put Sam Houston State ahead 38-37 before Clemson's back-breaking run.\n\nReed scored seven straight points to start the run while Mitchell added a pair of baskets, one off a steal where he dribbled into an official before getting clear for the layup and a 53-41 lead.\n\n\"I told him that was bad defense,\" Brownell joked about Mitchell.\n\nThe Bearkats (2-2) could not respond as Clemson eventually grew the margin to 16 points down the stretch.\n\nBoth Reed and Mitchell explored their NBA options last spring before choosing a final college year. They're each committed, Reed said, to an even bigger season than last year when the 25-win Tigers advanced to the Sweet 16.\n\nReed said he and Mitchell know they're the ones who must set the tone with Clemson's younger players.\n\n\"We've been in a lot of these situations and scenarios before,\" Reed said. \"So it's easy to spread it to the young guys.\"\n\nAamir Simms had 12 points and eight rebounds for Clemson.\n\nIt was Reed's second 20-point game of the season.\n\nKai Mitchell led Sam Houston State with 14 points and Josh Delaney added 11.\n\nClemson looked ready to blow things open early as it made its first six shots and led 15-7 five minutes in. But the Tigers went cold the rest of the half, and Sam Houston State took advantage.\n\nClemson made just five of its final 18 shots of the opening half and the Bearkats took the lead, 30-29 on Albert Almanza's four-point play with 43.8 seconds left when he got fouled by Elijah Thomas.\n\nBut Clemson's Mitchell answered with a long 3 20 seconds later to send the Tigers into the break up 32-30.\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nSam Houston State: The Bearkats have lost two in a row on the road. They showed an ability to hang with bigger Clemson for much of the game, but could not handle the Tigers' experience in the backcourt with three-year starters in Reed and Mitchell.\n\nClemson: The Tigers struggled to shoot consistently. Their defense, though, held up throughout the game as they limited Sam Houston State to less than 35 percent shooting with six steals and five blocks.\n\nTOUGH TIME FOR THOMAS\n\nThomas has played through a difficult stretch. He was hurting from an ankle injury in the Tigers' first two games and played against Sam Houston State despite being sick with the flu. Thomas had a 101-degree temperature Monday. He played 25 minutes Wednesday night with three points, five rebounds and two blocks.\n\nROAD WOES\n\nSam Houston State coach Jason Hooten has not liked what he's seen down the stretch in his team's first two road games. The Bearkats had the lead in the second half at Louisiana Tech and at Clemson, yet lost both games.\n\n\"There's been a moment where we had chance to seize, I'm not going to say the game, but the lead.

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDURHAM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Zion Williamson tossed up an alley-oop lob for RJ Barrett, and on the next trip downcourt, Barrett returned the favor by setting up a dunk for Williamson.\n\nFor these high-flying Blue Devils, that No. 1 ranking sure seems to fit.\n\nWilliamson scored 21 points, Barrett added 20 and Duke routed Eastern Michigan 84-46 on Wednesday night in its first game this season as the nation's top-ranked team.\n\n\"It is great to be No. 1, but nobody really cares who's No. 1 right now,\" Williamson said. \"The goal is to win a championship in March.\"\n\nJavin DeLaurier and Jack White added 10 points apiece for the Blue Devils (3-0). Playing two days after leapfrogging Kansas for the top spot in the AP Top 25, they looked every bit the part of a top-ranked team.\n\nThey shot 47 percent, turned 20 turnovers by the Eagles into 31 points and took command with an early 21-1 run keyed by an assortment of dunks by Williamson.\n\nDamari Parris had nine points to lead outmanned Eastern Michigan (3-1), which shot 31 percent and was stuck in single-digit scoring for about 17 \u00bd minutes.\n\nUnlike their last game \u2014 in which Army hung with them for about 30 minutes three days earlier \u2014 the Blue Devils took the drama out of this one early.\n\n\"Everything we did kind of worked,\" coach Mike Krzyzewski said, \"but the reason it worked is because we played so hard.\"\n\nWilliamson put Duke up by 20 for good midway through the first half with the highlight of the night \u2014 leaping so high to pull in a seemingly errant alley-oop pass that his armpits were even with the rim before he dunked \u2014 and Barrett made it a 30-point game with a bucket with about five minutes before halftime.\n\n\"The atmosphere got the best of us the first 6-7 minutes of the game,\" Eastern Michigan coach Rob Murphy said. \"It was a struggle for us to score in the first half, and once you get down in this building ... it's pretty hard to come back.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nEastern Michigan: Not surprisingly, the Eagles threw a 2-3 zone defense at the Blue Devils \u2014 Murphy spent seven years on the Syracuse staff with zone savant Jim Boeheim. It wasn't much of an impediment to the nation's top-ranked team, though that seems insignificant in the long run because nobody in the Mid-American Conference will match Duke's talent level.\n\nDuke: Being No. 1 is nothing new for the Duke program \u2014 the Blue Devils started the two previous seasons in the top spot \u2014 but it's a new experience for these freshmen. Not that they seem affected in the slightest. Williamson has scored at least 20 points in all three games while making 32 of his 39 shots.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nKrzyzewski says 3-point-shooting threat Cameron Reddish was dealing with soreness in his groin but \"nothing serious\" and would have played more had the game been closer. Reddish finished with three points on 1-of-5 shooting in less than 12 minutes.\n\nPLAY OF THE NIGHT\n\nThere were lots of choices, but the best of the bunch came midway through the first half when Reddish lobbed an alley-oop pass from just across midcourt that seemed headed for the seats. Williamson skied so high for it that his armpits and eyes were both at rim-level. That highlight-reel jam made it 28-7, putting Duke up by 20 for good.\n\nSTATS OF THE NIGHT\n\nBy the time Duke led by 20, Williamson had more dunks (four) than Eastern Michigan had field goals (three). ... The Eagles led for 18 early seconds \u2014 when it was 2-0 \u2014 and that brought the total amount of time the Blue Devils have trailed this season to 30 total seconds.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nEastern Michigan: Plays host to Boston University on Saturday.\n\nDuke: Faces San Diego State on Monday in its Maui Invitational opener.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Charles Matthews set the tone with a slam and celebrated by flexing to the crowd.\n\nQuickly, the rematch turned into a rout.\n\nMatthews scored 19 points, Ignas Brazdeikis had 18 and No. 18 Michigan beat No. 8 Villanova 73-46 Wednesday night in their first meeting since last season's national championship game.\n\nVillanova captured its second title in three years with a 79-62 victory over Michigan in April but was completely overmatched in the second game at its newly renovated Pavilion.\n\n\"I don't think when I'm out there,\" Matthews said, explaining his emotional reaction to a basket less than 90 seconds into the game. \"It was a fun, exciting game. I got the dunk and I screamed.\"\n\nEric Paschall scored 10 points and Phil Booth had nine for the Wildcats (2-1).\n\nThe Wolverines (3-0) jumped ahead early and never let up. They led 10-2 less than five minutes in and expanded the lead to 22-8 on Matthews' jumper midway through the opening half. A 17-3 run followed, giving Michigan a 39-13 lead. Matthews' dunk and consecutive 3-pointers from Isaiah Livers and Jordan Poole highlighted the run.\n\nMatthews capped the impressive first half with a steal and layup to send Michigan to the locker room with a 44-17 lead.\n\n\"I'm very impressed with Michigan,\" Villanova coach Jay Wright said. \"Really like their team, great togetherness, great execution. It's my fault I'm running a lot of guys out there. We're not as organized as we want to be. We're trying to figure out a lineup early in the season. We didn't have the cohesiveness to play a good team like that.\"\n\nVillanova's frustration was evident after Michigan's Zavier Simpson's flagrant foul led to a brief scuffle with Dhamir Cosby-Roundtree near midcourt with 13 minutes remaining and Michigan leading 52-24.\n\nThe Wildcats couldn't make any push in the second half, and fans hit the road early.\n\n\"They executed way better than we were prepared to play defense,\" Booth said.\n\nNeither team looked like the two squads who met in San Antonio seven months ago.\n\nVillanova lost four players who were drafted in the first 33 picks of the NBA draft. AP Player of the Year Jalen Brunson plays for the Dallas Mavericks. Omari Spellman is with the Atlanta Hawks. Mikal Bridges landed in Phoenix after a draft-night trade with the 76ers, and Donte DiVincenzo \u2014 who scored 31 points in the title game \u2014 is with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nMichigan lost three of its top four scorers. Moe Wagner, the star big man, was drafted by the Lakers in the first round and is playing in Germany. Duncan Robinson and Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman graduated.\n\n\"They're a young team and they lost a lot of people,\" Michigan coach John Beilein said. \"This is a November win. That's all it is. We have to learn from it, forget it and get ready for our next game.\"\n\nIMPRESSIVE FRESHMAN\n\nBrazdeikis' teammates love his attitude and confidence on the floor.\n\n\"Iggy is like a mean pit bull,\" Simpson said.\n\nTHE FINN\n\nBill Finneran, the Villanova alum who was the lead donor for the school's on-campus court that underwent a $65 million face-lift, was honored at halftime.\n\n\"The worst game you're going to see here,\" Finneran told the crowd.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMichigan: Brazdeikis showed he can score against tough competition, performing well against top defender Paschall. Brazdeikis and Matthews give the Wolverines a formidable wing duo going forward.\n\nVillanova: Showed its youth, giving Wright plenty of teaching points. The Wildcats relied on 3s the first two games, taking more shot attempts from beyond the arc than inside. They couldn't get them to fall from long range, going 3 for 15.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMichigan hosts George Washington on Saturday.\n\nVillanova hosts Furman on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Cristobal Herrera/EPA-EFE)\n\nEditor's note: Column published in partnership with The Marshall Project.\n\nDespite mixed congressional results in the midterms, one clear winner has emerged since Nov. 6: criminal justice reform.\n\nSeveral ballot measures passed across the country: Floridians restored the right to vote to people with felony convictions; Louisiana abolished convictions based on nonunanimous juries; Washington state tightened up police accountability; and Colorado removed language from the state Constitution allowing prison labor without pay.\n\nFlorida's Amendment 4 won with nearly two-thirds of the vote: 64 percent to 36 percent, claiming majorities in every region of the swing state. In fact, the breadth of support for Amendment 4 was nearly unanimous, drawing majorities in more than 90 percent of the state\u2019s 67 counties.\n\nThe results aren't surprising. Pre-election research conducted in Florida found overwhelming support for the constitutional amendment, which automatically restores voting rights to Floridians with felony convictions (except for those convicted of murder or sexual offenses) after they complete all terms of their sentences, including parole or probation.\n\nRelated content\n\nNEWSLETTER: Fresh takes on all things policing.

And support crosses party lines.\n\nFive years ago, before the reform debate heated up, more than half of voters were aware that incarceration rates were on the rise, and 63 percent said the country relied too heavily on locking people up.\n\nVoters have also rejected the \u201cwar on drugs.\u201d A solid majority of Americans support marijuana legalization. And in the absence of federal action, states have been taking steps to legalize that and decriminalize opioid use.\n\nThe pro-legalization voice showed up strong during the midterms. In Michigan, voters approved initiatives for recreational use of marijuana and possession. Voters in states as red as Missouri and Utah approved medicinal initiatives. This follows successful legalization in nine states and medical marijuana laws in 31 states.\n\nBut there is so much more to do.\n\nWhile Amendment 4 is indeed a progressive victory, even this reform is modest in scope. It excludes folks who have completed their sentences for murder and sexual assault convictions \u2014 entire classes of citizens who have successfully re-entered society \u2014 from having their voting rights immediately restored. Instead, they are stuck with Florida's old, arbitrary and broken system that relies on the governor to assess whether rights should be restored on a case-by-case basis. That practice leaves far too many people without the ability to exercise this basic right.\n\nWe ought to be going much further.\n\nPoliticians ignore the pressing need for criminal justice reform at their own peril. If they aren\u2019t motivated by a personal sense of morality, or at least by the desire to conserve government funds, then the public\u2019s clear desire for reform ought to catalyze their action.\n\nChange is coming, and politicians of both parties should help lead the way.\n\nCelinda Lake is president of Lake Research Partners and one of the Democratic Party's leading political strategists.

(Photo: AP)\n\nThe winner of the late-October Mega Millions lottery that created such a frenzy has yet to claim the prize and may remain anonymous even after cashing in on the $1.537 billion.\n\nRobert Bailey did not have that option.\n\nNew York state law requires winners to reveal their names when claiming a lottery prize, so Bailey took some steps to protect himself and his bonanza after collecting the biggest jackpot in state history, the $343.8 million Powerball on Oct. 27.\n\nHe consulted with a lawyer and with a financial adviser before stepping up to present his winning ticket with the numbers 8, 12, 13, 19 and 27, with the Powerball of 4.\n\nHe wore a beard and large dark glasses in posing for a publicity photo.\n\nHe kept most information about his family and his plans for the loot private during an introductory news conference at the Resorts World Casino in Queens.\n\nStill, the retired federal government worker realizes landing such a huge windfall comes with some pitfalls.\n\n\u201cYou have to watch out for your safety, that\u2019s the main thing,\u2019\u2019 Bailey said. \u201cWith any type of money, and this type of money also.\u2019\u2019\n\nBailey, who said he intends to buy his mother a house, has been playing the same six numbers for 25 years. The most he had won was $30,000 from a Take Five lottery ticket.\n\nHis Powerball take is actually half of the nearly $700 million pot up for grabs in the Oct. 27 drawing. A woman in Iowa also picked those numbers and will receive the other half.\n\nBailey, 67, purchased the lucky Powerball ticket at a deli in Harlem on a day when he was visiting a friend and ducked in to avoid the rain. And just because he won doesn\u2019t mean Bailey\u2019s done playing the lotto.\n\n\u201cI will continue playing my numbers until this train runs out,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to ride this out.

(AP Photo/Kelvin Kuo, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Derek Carr knew there would be growing pains adjusting to a new offense for the Oakland Raiders under coach Jon Gruden.\n\nThe surprising part for Carr and the Raiders is instead of showing steady progress throughout the year, the offense instead has regressed.\n\nThe Raiders (1-8) head into Sunday's game at Arizona (2-7) having gone back-to-back games without a touchdown for the first time since 2012, with the nine combined points in losses to San Francisco and the Chargers marking the lowest two-game output for Oakland since 2009.\n\n\"It gets frustrating because I know how hard some of our guys work and you expect it to continue to go this way,\" Carr said about the early season progress that hasn't been maintained. \"But this league, it's tough man, and it'll humble some guys really quick. ... When you turn the film on it's like, dang, if I just had that, or if I just would have checked to this or done this.\n\n\"You can sit there and second-guess it all the time, but the only thing that we have the opportunity to do is do our best right when it's in front of us. So, that's what we have to do better, we all have to play better. Coach puts us in great positions, we just have to play better.\"\n\nThe Raiders will try to improve the production this week despite possibly missing several key pieces on offense. Receiver Martavis Bryant is out at least a couple of weeks with a knee injury and receiver Jordy Nelson didn't practice Wednesday with a knee injury that has put his status in doubt this week.\n\nOakland already is without injured running back Marshawn Lynch, who is on injured reserve with a groin injury, and traded away No. 1 receiver Amari Cooper last month to Dallas.\n\nThat will likely give an opportunity this week to rookie Marcell Ateman, who began the year on the practice squad and has been inactive since getting promoted to the 53-man roster last month. Undrafted rookie Saeed Blacknall was promoted from the practice squad Wednesday and also could play a role.\n\nCarr has been impressed with Ateman's hard work at practice and attention to detail.\n\n\"One thing that really stuck out is during games, he'll come up to me and ask questions, not in a bothersome way or anything like that just, 'Hey, what did you see here? What if they ran the route like this?'\" Carr said.\n\n\"So, I can tell that he's not just here taking a redshirt year, enjoying his time wearing the team colors, he's really put in a lot of work and it means something to him. He's shown that, so hopefully he just goes out there and cuts it loose, because he's done all the right things, now he's just got to go play.\"\n\nAteman showed flashes in training camp, as he was able to use his size and jumping ability to make contested catches even when going up against the first team.\n\nAteman said the past few months of practice have made him even more ready to perform on Sunday.\n\n\"I didn't take a back seat when I got on the practice squad,\" he said. \"I kept working that so when I get my opportunity I'm better.\"\n\nNOTES: C Rodney Hudson (ankle), G Kelechi Osemele (knee), CB Gareon Conley (ankle), CB Daryl Worley (shoulder) and LB Kyle Wilber (knee) were all limited in practice. ...

With no game slated for the Bills on Sunday, Thompson, 29, has an extra few days to prep himself to appear in Buffalo\u2019s next game in Week 12 against the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nWith that, here\u2019s six things to know about the sorta new Bills wideout:\n\nBuffalo past\n\nStarting with the most obvious: this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard Thompson\u2019s name. He\u2019s been on the Bills a couple of times already. Most recently, Thompson played in 11 games with the Bills last year, seven of which were starts. During that span he had 27 catches for 430 yards with one touchdown. However, he also had a prior stint with the team, making this the third time he\u2019s signed on the dotted line with the Bills.\n\nIn 2014, he appeared in one game with the Bills and spent 2015 the offseason in western New York. He impressed during training camp and had a shot at the final roster, but was cut via injury settlement due to a foot injury. In addition, Thompson has a history playing with current Bills QB Matt Barkley in Chicago with the Bears, catching his first touchdown from him.\n\nHistoric catch\n\nIn Bills history, Thompson will always have a place. Without him, the 17-year playoff drought would be in its 18th season this year. Entering their Week 14 meeting with the Indianapolis Colts at 6-6, the Bills had to win. At 10 a.m., it looked like another fall day in Orchard Park. Then, December showed up by 1 p.m. and dumped feet of snow on New Era Field. The game was played in near blizzard weather. Still, the show went on and went into overtime. During said overtime, Thompson and third-string quarterback Joe Webb connected on a 34-yard lunging catch by the wideout. It setup LeSean McCoy\u2019s game-winning touchdown run moments later and Buffalo took the \u2018W\u2019 and went to the postseason.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Alex Cora brought a new voice and culture to the Boston Red Sox that helped propel them to their latest World Series title.\n\nThe Red Sox rewarded him for bringing home a championship in his first year with the team by giving him a new contract with an additional guaranteed year through the 2021 season.\n\nThe deal containing the extension was announced Wednesday by Boston also includes a club option for 2022.\n\nIn his rookie season as a major league manager, Cora guided the Red Sox to a franchise-record 108 victories and the team's fourth championship in 15 seasons.\n\nHe finished second in the AL Manager of the Year voting announced Tuesday.\n\n\"We have consistently been impressed by Alex at every turn,\" Red Sox chairman Tom Werner said in a statement. \"His knowledge of the game, ability to connect with our players, and his incredible instincts and decisiveness led us to an historic championship season. We know we are in good hands and could not be more pleased to know he will be with us for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nRed Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski was in search of new direction for the club when he fired former manager John Farrell after back-to-back Al Division Series losses in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAfter the historic regular season, Cora then steered Boston past the 100-win Yankees and Astros in the AL playoffs before downing the Dodgers in the World Series.\n\n\"For me, 2018 was not only historic, but it was special as well, both on and off the field,\" Cora said in a statement. \"We have a great appreciation for our accomplishments this past year, but now our focus moves forward to the season ahead and defending our World Series title.\"\n\nDuring Boston's run Cora got the best out his young talent, led by AL MVP favorite Mookie Betts. They shined in player-centric approach in which Cora encouraged an aggressive hitting mentality, lots of hit-and-runs and active running of the bases.\n\nCora also the most out of his pitching staff, which included clutch performances in the postseason by Chris Sale and David Price. Neither pitcher had logged a playoff victory as a starter prior to this season.\n\nPrice had a tough time acclimating to Boston's rugged sports environment during his first two seasons of the seven-year, $217 million deal he signed in 2015.\n\nHe's found a groove late in the season, pitching the clinching Game 5 of the ALCS to help the Red Sox advance.\n\n\"Just his demeanor. It doesn't change,\" Price said last month. \"I know it's easy to not change when your team wins 108 games in the regular season. But he hasn't changed one bit.\"\n\nA member of the Red Sox's 2007 World Series title team as a player, Cora was the bench coach on Houston's 2017 championship team. He learned from manager A.J. Hinch that being close to players would be beneficial.\n\n\"Talking to players is not bad, having a relationship with players is not bad,\" Cora said in describing his managerial philosophy. \"Doing that, you're going to get the best out of them. People may think that crossing that line is not helpful, but I see it the other way around, and I lived it.\"\n\nCora became the first manager from Puerto to guide a team to a championship. It came more than a year after Hurricane Maria devastated island, prompting Cora during initial contract negotiations last October to ask the Red Sox to help his people with relief efforts. Ownership responded by sending a chartered plane full of supplies.\n\nDays after winning the World Series, they again obliged Cora's request to take the trophy to his hometown of Caguas, Puerto Rico.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In particular, which movies about a green guy trying to ruin Christmas are best?\n\nWe found there was a difference in opinion that coincided with a generation gap: I, the young millennial, adored Jim Carrey as the self-loathing, ornament-eating, heavily made-up Grinch from 2000. My colleagues pooh-poohed my take, saying instead that the 1966 TV special (which I admittedly haven't seen) or new animated film are far preferable.\n\nAnother argument was ignited over whether Will Ferrell's \"Elf\" is a holiday classic. I argued that \"Santa! I KNOW him!\" is one of the greatest movie lines of all time. My colleagues shook their heads.\n\nIt's nice to see that at least moviegoers surveyed by Fandango are on my side.\n\nAccording to 1,000 film fans ages 18-34 surveyed by streaming site FandangoNOW, the holiday movies they are most likely to stream around Thanksgiving and Christmas are \"Home Alone,\" \"Elf,\" \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" and \u2013 despite the fact that Bruce Willis himself doesn't call it a Christmas movie \u2013 \"Die Hard.\"\n\nHere are the top 15 holiday films millennials plan to watch this season:\n\n1. \"Home Alone\" (1990)\n\n2. \"Elf\" (2003)\n\n3. \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (2000)\n\n4. \"Die Hard\" (1988)\n\n5. \"The Santa Clause\" (1994)\n\n6. \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" (1989)\n\n7. \"A Christmas Story\" (1983)\n\n8. \"Love Actually\" (2003)\n\n9. \"The Polar Express\" (2004)\n\n10. \"It's A Wonderful Life\" (1946)\n\n11. \"Miracle on 34th Street\" (1947)\n\n12. \"Gremlins\" (1984)\n\n13. \"Scrooged\" (1988)\n\n14. \"The Holiday\" (2006)\n\n15. \"Bad Santa\" (2003)\n\nMore: New on Netflix for the holidays: 'The Princess Switch,' 'Sabrina' and 'BoJack' specials\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/14/exclusive-fandango-millennials-favorite-holiday-films/2006329002/"}]
