(Photo: Bebeto Matthews/AP)\n\nAs the nation struggled with the rising number of opioid deaths, a private drug company increased the price of an overdose antidote more than 600 percent, a Senate subcommittee says in a new report.\n\nThe increase has cost the federal Medicare and Medicaid health programs more than $142 million since 2014, according the Homeland Security permanent subcommittee on investigations.\n\nRichmond, Virginia-based Kaleo increased the price of its auto-injectable overdose-reversal drug EVZIO from $575 to $4,100, the subcommittee reported.\n\nThe company also changed its sales strategy and encouraged doctors to complete paperwork identifying it as a medically necessary drug, allowing them to bypass potentially cheaper generic versions of naloxone, the subcommittee reported.\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who chairs the subcommittee, blasted the price hike.\n\n\"The fact that one company dramatically raised the price of its naloxone drug and cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in increased drug costs, all during a national opioid crisis, is simply outrageous,\" Portman said in a statement.\n\nKaleo defended its pricing Monday. The company said its donated kits have saved thousands of lives. It also said it has never turned a profit.\n\n\"We believe patients and physicians should have meaningful choices,\" the company said in a statement. \"There is no doubt, the complexity of our healthcare system has had unintended negative implications for everyone involved, but most importantly, for patients. To this end, we explored viable paths within the current healthcare system to make EVZIO available to patients in a responsible, meaningful and affordable way.\"\n\nNaloxone, an opioid overdose-reversal drug available since the early 1970s, has been in great demand to slow an epidemic that kills more Americans every year than motor vehicle crashes. The U.S. Surgeon General and states across the nation have encouraged policies to widely distribute the drug.\n\nPrivate drug companies have responded to the crisis with newer, easier-to-use versions of the drug.\n\nEVZIO was launched in 2014 at a wholesale price of $575 per kit.\n\nAdapt Pharma gained approval the following year to sale a nasal version of naloxone called Narcan, and set the wholesale price at $125 per kit.\n\nThe subcommittee focused on the price of EVZIO because it increased so sharply and because the sales strategy that relied on reimbursement from private and government insurance plans.\n\nThe subcommittee said the company relied on a private consultant to implement the new sales strategy, which included dropping contracts with private Medicare plans and Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for low-income and disabled residents.\n\nThat decision freed the company from administrative costs and rebate payments.\n\nThe company collected an average payment of $609 per kit in 2015. After raising the price and adapting the new sales strategy, the company collected from Medicare an average of $3,854 per kit.\n\nThe company paid $10.2 million to the private consultant who suggested the new approach, the subcommittee said.\n\n\"Kaleo's more than 600 percent price increase of EVZIO not only exploits a country in the middle of an opioid crisis, but also American taxpayers who fund government-run health care programs designed to be a safety net for our country\u2019s elderly and most vulnerable,\" the subcommittee reported.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/19/kaleo-opioid-overdose-antidote-naloxone-evzio-rob-portman-medicare-medicaid/2060033002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Louisville signs 6 basketball recruits for 2019 class", "description": "Louisville announces the signings of 6 basketball recruits for 2019 class", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/19/louisville-signs-6-basketball-recruits-for-2019-class/38568039/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:52:30Z", "content": "LOUISVILLE, Ky.

(AP Photo/Mike Stewart) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 The last time Georgia hosted its state rival, the famed hedges surrounding the field at Sanford Stadium took quite a beating.\n\nThis time around, the Bulldogs have a lot more to worry about than horticulture.\n\nNo. 5 Georgia (10-1) is still in the mix for a return trip to the College Football playoffs \u2014 assuming it doesn't slip up Saturday against Georgia Tech.\n\n\"We know that we have to finish our schedule strong this weekend and the following weekend in order to do what we want to accomplish,\" tight end Isaac Nauta said. \"I feel like we have really been clicking and playing well. We just have to continue going and get a big win this weekend.\"\n\nThe Bulldogs, who also were ranked fifth in last week's CFP standings , have already locked up a spot against top-ranked Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game Dec. 1.\n\nThat will essentially serve as a play-in game to the playoffs, as long as Georgia still has just one loss on its record.\n\n\"We just have to get this game over with and see where we end up,\" linebacker D'Andre Walker said.\n\nWhile the Bulldogs have largely dominated the series known as \"Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate\" since the mid-1960s, winning 40 of the last 54 meetings, the Yellow Jackets have pulled off a few notable surprises in Athens.\n\nIn fact, their last four victories over Georgia have been between the hedges, including both 2014 and 2016 (Georgia, in a similar vein, hasn't lost in Atlanta since 1999).\n\nAfter that game two years ago, the Yellow Jackets commemorated their 28-27 upset by brazenly plucking off branches as souvenirs .\n\nLots and lots of branches.\n\nGeorgia is determined to prevent a repeat.\n\n\"I'm excited to win this one and make sure those hedges don't get touched,\" Nauta said. \"We're going to make sure it doesn't happen this year by handling business when they're on the field.\"\n\nTo provide extra motivation, video of the hedge vandals has been playing on a loop in the Bulldogs' weight room, as well as other reminders scattered throughout the training facility.\n\n\"I want this, and I know everybody on the team wants this,\" said Jonathan Ledbetter, a senior defensive end. \"We have taken a lot of disrespect from Georgia Tech. I know some people would much rather see us beat Georgia Tech than win a national championship, and we are not going disappoint.\"\n\nGeorgia, of course, has been eyeing another shot at Alabama since last year's national championship game.\n\nThe Bulldogs squandered a pair of 13-point leads before losing in overtime, 26-23, when Tua Tagovailoa launched a 41-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on second-and-26 .\n\nSince the only loss this season, a 36-16 blowout at LSU , Georgia has won four straight games by double-digit margins, including impressive wins over rivals Florida and Auburn as well as an SEC East-clinching victory at Kentucky . This past Saturday, in what amounted to little more than a glorified scrimmage, the Bulldogs piled up 701 yards \u2014 the second-highest total in school history \u2014 in a 66-27 rout of UMass .\n\nWhile Georgia opened as a 17-point favorite over the Yellow Jackets, this will surely be a much more challenging game. Georgia Tech (7-4) also has a four-game winning streak and is coming off a thrilling 30-27 overtime victory over Virginia that clinched a winning season, quite a turnaround after a 1-3 start.\n\nBulldogs coach Kirby Smart called the Jackets \"arguably one of the hottest teams in the country as far as what they're doing offensively. They've put four really good games together back to back, scoring a lot of points.\"\n\nAs is always the case for any team preparing to face Georgia Tech, there is plenty of attention on coach Paul Johnson's triple-option offense. The Yellow Jackets lead the nation in rushing yards (353.7 per game) and have largely given up any notion of a passing game, completing just 6 of 15 throws over those last four games.\n\nAsked what his defense needs to be focusing on, Smart said, \"You have two or three hours? You can't just define them in a few words.\"\n\nHe went on to say, \"Eye control, discipline, toughness, tackling, it's limitless. You have to be disciplined. You have to do your job and you have to key things the right way. If you don't, they expose you. Paul does a tremendous job of seeing when people are out of place, seeing when people don't do things the right way.\"\n\nSmart has also preached the importance of winning at home.\n\n\"That's been a message all year,\" he said. \"The teams that have been championship teams have defended their home turf. We have a bulletin board about it. When you win your games at home, it gives you a much better chance to win the East. When you win games at home, it gives you a much better chance of winning the SEC.\"\n\nAnd let's not forget the chance to win a national title, too.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

(AP Photo/Kelvin Kuo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Chargers remain in strong position for a playoff spot at 7-3, but injuries on defense and special teams struggles are concerns for coach Anthony Lynn.\n\nLos Angeles lost a defensive starter for the second straight week when Corey Liuget suffered a season-ending knee injury during the second quarter of Sunday's 23-22 loss to the Denver Broncos. He is the third starter who will be headed to injured reserve, joining linebackers Kyzir White and Denzel Perryman.\n\nLiuget missed the first four games for violating the league's policy on performance enhancers but bolstered the pass rush in the six games he played. Darius Philon, who started the first seven games and has 2.5 sacks, will move back into the starting spot and rookie Justin Jones will see more snaps.\n\nLynn said he was pleased with how defensive end Joey Bosa played in his first game. Bosa, who missed the first nine games due to a bone bruise to his left foot, played 31 of 56 snaps. The plan going into the game was for Bosa to see 20 plays.\n\n\"For his first game back I thought he looked good. He had good speed and explosion plus he came out of it healthy,\" Lynn said.\n\nThe Chargers' struggles on special teams will require more shuffling. They allowed a fake punt for the second straight week, which Lynn said was unacceptable. Kicker Michael Badgley made all three field goal attempts but missed an extra point. Los Angeles has missed six PATs this season. Caleb Sturgis missed five before being released.\n\nOne possibility to prevent another fake punt is to leave the defense out there with Desmond King as the returner.\n\n\"We ran punt safe some yesterday. The one time we didn't we got faked on. There's some things we're going to do differently there,\" Lynn said.\n\nLos Angeles had 14 penalties Sunday, which was the team's most in Lynn's two seasons as coach. He said a lot of the penalties early were offensive linemen trying to get a jump on Denver's pass rush.\n\nThe Chargers \u2014 who had a six-game winning streak snapped by the Broncos \u2014 have a two-game lead over Baltimore for the first wild card. They host Arizona on Sunday before a challenging December stretch that includes Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Kansas City and the Ravens.\n\n\"It was a game we could have and should have won. It was definitely a wake-up call for us,\" Lynn said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Bears won 25-20. (AP Photo/David Banks) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) \u2014 With a tighter grip on the NFC North, the Chicago Bears are in unfamiliar territory and facing a different kind of challenge as the season heads toward its final stretch.\n\nLearning to handle success.\n\n\"We have to make sure that we just continue to keep those blinders on, keep the earmuffs on, don't listen to anything and just keep playing our football,\" coach Matt Nagy said.\n\nThe Bears sure look as if they're serious about winning the division after a 25-20 prime-time victory over the second-place Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.\n\nThe defense dominated, with Khalil Mack leading the way. Cody Parkey bounced back from a miserable performance to make all three of his field goals. And the Bears (7-3) came away with their fourth straight win.\n\nOne concern for them: Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky injured his right shoulder.\n\nNagy made no reference to Trubisky's health after the game or when he met with reporters on Monday afternoon. But the Bears later said Trubisky would not have participated had they practiced. They were required by NFL rules to release a hypothetical injury report because they play Thursday at Detroit.\n\nThat the Bears are leading the division is quite a change after four consecutive last-place finishes. For the first time in years, managing success is an issue for them.\n\n\"When it's the other way, and people tell you how bad of a coach you are, how poor of a player you are and you should be cut and you should be fired, we don't listen to it,\" said Nagy, in his first season as a head coach. \"So it's the same thing when you're having success. You don't listen to it. You understand both sides, but we worry about what's said in this building.\"\n\nThere are plenty of good things to say about the Bears at the moment.\n\nThey're heading toward their first playoff appearance since the 2010 season. They're on their longest win streak since a six-game run in 2012. They beat division opponents the past two weeks after dropping 10 in a row against them. And they could make it three over the NFC North in a 12-day span with a victory at Detroit on Thursday.\n\nThe Bears beat the Lions 34-22 at Soldier Field on Nov. 11 , with Trubisky throwing for a career-high 355 yards and three touchdowns. Chicago also jumped out to a 26-0 lead and sacked Matthew Stafford six times in that game.\n\nThe victory over Minnesota was a sort of validation for Chicago after beating teams with losing records the previous three games, including the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills.\n\n\"It shows that we can battle with the best of them,\" running back Tarik Cohen said. \"It shows that we are still getting better and that we haven't reached our ceiling yet. Only we can decide what our ceiling is.\"\n\nThe Bears are looking good at the moment, with a defense ranked third overall through Sunday. They were allowing league lows in yards rushing per game (77.8) and per carry (3.5), and had more interceptions (18) and takeaways (27) than any other team.\n\n\"I think our offense is doing a great job with having the first possession and putting points on the board,\" cornerback Prince Amukamara said.\n\n\"Our offense is really getting things going, so it makes it a little bit easier for the defense because now we know the opposing team's offense needs to get going and start passing more to get points on the board.\"\n\nMack had a sack against Minnesota, giving him three in the past two weeks and eight in eight games this season. And Eddie Jackson returned an interception for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nParkey also got some redemption after hitting uprights four times while missing two field goals and two extra points against the Lions. But he didn't attempt an extra point on Sunday.\n\nNagy opted to go for two after each of their two touchdowns. And he acknowledged Parkey's struggles the previous week factored into those decisions. He also insisted his own aggressive nature and a belief the plays would work were big reasons.\n\nChicago converted both times, with Trubisky passing to Josh Bellamy in the second quarter and Adam Shaheen in the fourth.\n\n\"It worked,\" Nagy said. \"It doesn't always work. And you've got to make sure that you get two out of every three.\"\n\nNagy said he discussed the plan with Parkey and wasn't worried about how it would impact his confidence.\n\n\"Whenever you're honest with people, it's so easy to do what you do because you're real with them,\" Nagy said. \"You tell them exactly what you're feeling and everybody knows the plan.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHow stupid does Saudi Arabia think people are?\n\nIn the seven weeks since journalist Jamal Khashoggi vanished after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, the Saudis have offered a shifting series of fables to explain what happened to him. In chronological order, the government in Riyadh has said that:\n\n\u25baKhashoggi left the consulate on his own in a matter of minutes, even though his fianc\u00e9e grew frantic waiting outside for hours. (\"We are very keen to know what happened to him,\" the kingdom's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, told Bloomberg News at the time. \"We have nothing to hide.\u201d)\n\n\u25baA 15-member team that flew into Istanbul, described by Turkish authorities as a Saudi hit squad, was only a group of tourists.\n\n\u25baKhashoggi was strangled in the consulate after a fistfight broke out.\n\n\u25baThe killing was a \"rogue\" operation and possibly premeditated.\n\n\u25baThe Saudi agents had intended to bring the journalist home alive, and the killing was improvised, not premeditated.\n\nAccording to Saudi prosecutors' latest version, a team leader chose to kill Khashoggi by lethal injection and have his body dismembered. Bin Salman, of course, \"did not have any knowledge\" of the crime.\n\nThis latest round-up-the-usual-suspects cover story raises three questions: Why would anyone bring a bone saw to a planned abduction? What happened to Khashoggi\u2019s body?And why should anyone believe a word the Saudis say about this matter?\n\nFar more credible accounts about the fate of Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Virginia resident who wrote columns for The Washington Post, have come from Turkish investigators. They have released evidence of a meticulous plot that included a look-alike to dress in Khashoggi's clothing and make it appear he left the consulate, and a forensic specialist equipped with a saw for cutting up the body.\n\nThey also have audio evidence that Khashoggi was killed soon after entering the consulate, and that a close aide to the crown prince, Maher Mutreb, called a superior to say \"tell your boss\" the mission was accomplished.\n\nAnd who was the \"boss\" in question?\n\nWithin 24 hours of Riyadh dispensing its latest revisionist version of Khashoggi's grisly murder, news outlets reported the CIA's \"high confidence\" conclusion that the dissident journalist was assassinated by Salman's order. A more complete report is due out as early as Tuesday.\n\nThe CIA finding not only puts a lie to the Saudi government's determination to distance the hot-headed and impetuous Salman from a killing carried out by his closest aides, but it also places President Donald Trump in a tough moral dilemma.\n\nThe president has vowed \"very severe\" repercussions if Riyadh is responsible for the killing of Khashoggi. But he has shrank from blaming the 33-year-old Saudi leader, whom Trump sees as a vital ally in countering Iranian influence and in brokering a Middle East peace deal.\n\n\u201cI hope ... the crown prince didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d Trump said last month. On Sunday, the president suggested that it will be difficult to establish definitive proof. \"Will anybody really know?\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace.\n\nNot if the cover-up is allowed to succeed. Saudi prosecutors have announced indictments of 11 unnamed defendants for the murder, including five who may face execution \u2014 which, if carried out, would conveniently eliminate five potential witnesses.\n\nThe Trump administration has issued sanctions against Mutreb and 16 other midlevel players said to be involved in Khashoggi's murder. But as Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., noted on CNN: \"Sanctioning people who are already in jail is sort of like pretending to do something.\"\n\nHe's right. According to the CIA, a crown prince with a history of repressing dissent acted ruthlessly and recklessly to silence a critic, in rank violation of American values. Anything less than severe sanctions \u2014 diplomatic, economic and military \u2014 is tantamount to letting him get away with murder.\n\n(Saudi Arabia's embassy in Washington declined to provide an opposing view to this editorial.)\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

(AP Photo/David Graham) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Joey Logano's team headed to South Beach long before NASCAR's newest champion wrapped up his obligations at Homestead-Miami Speedway. He was emotional, exhausted and still trying to comprehend how he'd chased down The Big Three to snatch his first career NASCAR title.\n\n\"I don't even know how to party,\" Logano said. \"I guess I'm just going to follow whatever they do.\"\n\nTeam Penske was indeed waiting for the newly minted champion to arrive and show him how to celebrate \u2014 just another life lesson learned on the job for Logano.\n\nLogano has literally grown up on NASCAR's national stage, transitioning from over-hyped teenager to seasoned veteran during a decade-long journey in which many of his experiences played out publicly and made him an easy target for his peers to push around.\n\nFew knew what to make out of the gangly kid from Connecticut when Hall of Fame driver Mark Martin declared him NASCAR's next superstar. Logano got the nickname \"Sliced Bread\" even before his first NASCAR event, and after being held in development by Joe Gibbs Racing the team celebrated his 18th birthday with a sheet cake at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\n\nGibbs was ready to see Logano's promised talent and had him in a race one week after he was legally old enough to compete in NASCAR. Old enough but maybe not ready.\n\n\"I expected to go out there and win and just got my butt handed to me on a platter,\" Logano said.\n\nLogano came to NASCAR as a raw talent unafraid of aggressive racing. His rivals thought he should know his place, and he struggled to live by the so-called driver code. It nearly ended his career as Gibbs let Logano go after five seasons that produced two wins but was marred by disputes with Kevin Harvick and Tony Stewart, among others.\n\nEverything could have ended for Logano after that 2012 season.\n\n\"As a kid growing up, I was an aggressive racer and I was able to win a lot of races,\" Logano said. \"I got humbled pretty quick. I got beat up. I got pushed around a lot. I wasn't fast. I didn't have no respect. I think that beats up on your confidence pretty quickly. There's a lot of times that I felt really weak, and I'd break down. You know, when you're confused, you don't know how to be better. You're 18 years old or 19 or 20, and this is some pretty big stuff for a teenager to be able to go through.\"\n\nIt was Roger Penske who rescued Logano from unemployment. Team Penske had an open seat alongside 2012 champion Brad Keselowski, who wanted Logano as his teammate.\n\nThe lifeline saved his career.\n\n\"I was losing my job at Gibbs, that was a pretty low point for me, and I don't think I thought as clearly as I do now,\" Logano said. \"I was thinking, 'Oh my gosh, I'm not going to be a race car driver anymore,' and 'What am I going to do with my life? This is awful.' Next thing you know, there's the 22 car and Roger Penske.\"\n\nThe transition wasn't exactly smooth.\n\nPenske has backed Logano from the very first day and doesn't want his driver to change. It meant more incidents with other drivers, including a feud with Matt Kenseth that cost Logano a shot at the 2015 championship. Logano was the favorite but hard racing with Kenseth had created a fracture Logano was ill-prepared to fix. He thought by not backing down or pacifying Kenseth it would go away, but it only made things worse. Kenseth deliberately wrecked Logano in a race Logano was going to win and it cost Logano a slot in NASCAR's season-ending championship race.\n\nThat was the most difficult bump to date in Logano's climb.\n\nIt is also the one that likely helped him win the championship. It toughened him up and taught him a valuable lesson in handing adversity.\n\nLogano found another gear at the start of the playoffs and outperformed Harvick, Kyle Busch and Martin Truex Jr., the so-called Big Three that dominated the regular season. Logano won twice in the postseason, including Sunday night's finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, never thinking he couldn't win this title \u2014 even as the underdog in a heavyweight field and even in those frantic final moments after a late caution and restart when he had to mash the gas on the No. 22 Ford and go for broke.\n\nIn previous seasons, Logano had been a target for championship contenders in the lead up to the finale. They used NASCAR's mandatory promotional appearances to try to psyche Logano out of the title. He was likely susceptible to it, too. On the eve of the 2014 championship, when Logano was set to race against tough-as-nails Harvick, Logano admitted he binge-watched \"Boy Meets World\" with his wife to relax.\n\nHe's 28 now, the father of an infant son he and his wife struggled to conceive, and has a decade of experience navigating NASCAR. When NASCAR sent the title contenders out to promote the finale last week, Logano held his own, didn't let anyone get in his head and told everyone he was the favorite.\n\nNow he's a NASCAR champion.\n\n\"You can't just be confident and say (things) because then it's just kind of BS, right?\" Logano said. \"You have to believe it inside. You honestly need to preach to yourself sometimes, and I do that as much as I can and to our race team, because we didn't have a reason to not feel confident. We've executed under high pressure situations before, and we've been here before. I just had to go do my job.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Photo: Zbigniew Bzdak, Chicago Tribune, via AP)\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 A Chicago police officer and two hospital workers were killed Monday by a gunman who carried out a grisly assault at a city hospital.\n\nPolice identified the fallen officer as Samuel Jimenez, a young cop with less than two years with the department. Hospital officials said emergency room doctor Tamara O'Neal and first-year pharmacy resident Dayna Less were the other victims in the afternoon shooting at Mercy Hospital on the city's South Side.\n\nThe shooter, who authorities identified as 32-year-old Juan Lopez, also was killed in the incident. He was previously engaged to O'Neal, according to family members who spoke with reporters.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel called it a devastating moment for a city that for years has endured daunting levels of gun violence. It was a bleak end to a day that started with the city celebrating the graduation of the newest class of 88 police officers and the promotion of 275 newly-minted detectives, sergeants, lieutenants, evidence technicians and field training officers.\n\n\u201cThe city of Chicago lost a doctor, a pharmaceutical assistant, and a police officer all going about their day, all doing what they love,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThis tears at the soul of our city.\u201d\n\nThe top prosecutor for the Chicago area, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, called the violence at the hospital senseless.\n\n\u201cThe violence that occurred today at Mercy Hospital is horrific,\u201d Foxx said on Twitter. \u201cThe County mourns the victims who lost their lives, including CPD Officer Samuel Jimenez for making the ultimate sacrifice to save the lives of others. May we uplift the families of those harmed and our city.\u201d\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the incident was spurred by a domestic altercation that started outside the hospital between the gunman and O'Neal.\n\nAn acquaintance of O'Neal arrived at the scene, and the gunman lifted his shirt, displaying a handgun before shooting at O'Neal, Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said the gunman, who was armed with a lone handgun, also fired shots at officers who had arrived at the scene and struck their squad car before running into the hospital. Additional officers arrived at the scene and engaged the gunman for several minutes inside the hospital.\n\nLess, the pharmacy resident, was shot as she walked out off an elevator, Johnson said.\n\n\"That woman got off an elevator and was shot, why?\" Johnson asked.\n\nPatrick Connor, who is head emergency medicine at Mercy, said O'Neal, 38, who grew up in nearby Portage, Indiana, was \"simply one of the most fascinating, hard working people.\" Less, a recent graduate from Purdue University, had been at the hospital since July, Connor said.\n\nJohnson said it was not clear if the gunman was killed by police gunfire or a self-inflicted wound.\n\nSteven Mixon, an emergency room clerk, told the Chicago Tribune that he was waiting outside the hospital for an Uber when he saw O'Neal \u201cbeing harassed by some gentleman.\" He said she waved to him to come to her.\n\nMixon said he didn't make it to her before the gunman began shooting.\n\n\u201cI guess it wasn\u2019t my time to go because if I had made it to her, I would have been dead too,\u201d Mixon said.\n\nJimenez, who was married and a father of three, had just ended his required probationary term with the department.\n\nAnother officer was hit by a bullet in his holster during the chaotic exchange but was not seriously injured, police said.\n\nKevin Graham, president of Chicago\u2019s Fraternal Order of Police union, praised the fallen officer.\n\n\u201cToday, the Fraternal Order of Police lost a valued brother \u2014 a courageous police officer who got up this morning, went to work and wanted to protect the city of Chicago,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe did just that, but he did so with his life.\u201d\n\nJohnson said he was certain the police\u2019s quick response saved many lives. Jimenez and his partner were not assigned to the call but responded anyway.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that all those officers who responded are heroes,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSteven White, a patient at the hospital who had been waiting to be discharged, said the shooting started near the emergency room entrance.\n\n\u201cIt was, 'Pow, pow, pow,' '' said White, who was treated for dehydration at the hospital.\n\nWhite said he could see through the window the woman lying on the ground.\n\n\"You see stuff like this on TV, but to see someone so coldhearted,\u201d White said. \u201cIt was like he had no remorse.\u201d\n\nThe gunman ran into the building, and a police officer chased him. As bystanders took cover, White said, he heard the gunman fire at least six shots.\n\nToday, we mourn Chicago Police Officer Samuel Jimenez. His heroic actions saved countless lives. He ran toward danger. He ran toward those shots. He ran into fire.

It is a national tragedy. It is especially senseless when a shooting occurs in the healing space of a hospital.\"\n\nChicago recorded 762 murders in 2016 and 650 in 2017. The city had recorded 488 murders for 2018 as of Nov. 11, more than any other U.S. city but an 18 percent decline from last year.\n\nJimenez was the second Chicago Police officer to be slain in the city in 2018, and the 48th officer shot and killed in the line of duty across the country this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks such deaths.\n\nIn February, Cmdr. Paul Bauer, a veteran of more than three decades in the Chicago force, was fatally shot while confronting a man who had run from police officers, during an incident in downtown Chicago.\n\nMercy Hospital and Medical Center is a 292-bed surgical Catholic teaching hospital that was established in 1852.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/19/chicago-hospital-shooting-reports-multiple-victims-mercy-hospital/2060629002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Steve Gardner, USA TODAY", "title": "Yankees acquire left-hander James Paxton from Mariners for three prospects", "description": "James Paxton, who threw a no-hitter last season for the Mariners, acquired in trade for top pitching prospect, two others.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2018/11/19/yankees-acquire-lefty-james-paxton-mariners-trade/2061676002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/8330b922-1dd4-48b8-95b8-aa254a6241b5-james-paxton.jpg?crop=4805,2703,x0,y72&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:35:52Z", "content": "James Paxton posted a 3.76 ERA with 208 strikeouts in 28 starts last season for the Seattle Mariners.

Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.\n\nIn their attempt to have the case dismissed, Weinstein's lawyers accused prosecutors of failing to show the grand jury evidence that they contend undermines the charges.\n\nWilson, the assistant district attorney, countered Monday that prosecutors have no obligation to present to the grand jury evidence favorable to a defendant.\n\n\"A review of the grand jury minutes will reveal that evidence was presented properly and with correct legal instructions,\" Wilson wrote in the filing.\n\nBrafman, the defense attorney, said he plans to file a reply to the prosecution's motion after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe next court hearing in the case is scheduled for Dec. 20.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/19/weinstein-case-prosecutors-press-forward-sex-crime-charges/2061679002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Suspected gunman dead in Chicago hospital shooting", "description": "Police in Chicago say a suspected gunman is dead and an officer and three others are in critical condition in a shooting at a hospital in the city (Nov. 19)", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/19/suspected-gunman-dead-chicago-hospital-shooting/38567851/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5969165583001_5969161172001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:28:54Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Wilks mulls unspecified changes after Cardinals' ugly loss", "description": "A bad season has gotten much worse for the Arizona Cardinals", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/19/wilks-mulls-unspecified-changes-after-cardinals-ugly-loss/38567897/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dbf2eb9fea45a6969da1f98f6c9c3552afe48340/c=0-422-3639-2469/local/-/media/2018/11/19/USATODAY/usatsports/180c584483bc4906ab782393f13d8704.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:27:08Z", "content": "Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr (4) greets Arizona Cardinals quarterback Josh Rosen after an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Glendale, Ariz.

The Raiders won 23-21. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 A bad season got much worse for the Arizona Cardinals with a home loss to Oakland.\n\nEmbattled first-year coach Steve Wilks is mulling some changes, although he didn't say what they were, and there's only so much the Cardinals can do considering their injuries and the overall state of their roster.\n\n\"Right now, being 2-8, you're open to a lot of things from a standpoint of personnel changes, things that you think will give us an opportunity to be successful and win a football game,\" Wilks said at his Monday news conference.\n\nSunday's 23-21 loss left three teams tied for the worst record in the NFL: the Cardinals, Oakland and San Francisco. And the remaining schedule is formidable for the Cardinals.\n\nThey play at the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, followed by a trip to Green Bay the following week. There are also games at Atlanta and the season finale at Seattle. Arizona has only two remaining home games \u2014 Dec. 9 against Detroit and Dec. 23 against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe Cardinals' chances for many more, if any, victories seem slim, especially if play doesn't improve.\n\n\"It's not playing smart, just beating ourselves,\" veteran safety Antoine Bethea said after the game. \"That's the most frustrating thing about it. Week in and week out, it's just like the same thing.\"\n\nA positive aspect of the mistake-laded Arizona effort was the continued resurgence of David Johnson.\n\nThe dynamic back rushed for a season-best 137 yards, 53 of them on a run that set up Josh Rosen's 5-yard TD pass to Larry Fitzgerald that put Arizona up 21-20 with 5:02 to play. Johnson had a 57-yard touchdown run called back by a holding call against tight end Ricky Seals-Jones.\n\nIt was one of several Arizona mistakes in the game's final minutes. Jermaine Gresham was called for unnecessary roughness and Josh Bynes dropped an interception.\n\nThe Cardinals allowed Oakland, with no timeouts, to drive 63 yards in the final 1:53, setting up Daniel Carlson's decisive 35-yard field goal as the game ended.\n\nRosen threw for three touchdowns \u2014 two to Fitzgerald \u2014 but was intercepted twice, both picks leading to first-half touchdowns. Rosen had only nine completions in 20 attempts for 136 yards.\n\n\"I think a lot of it is just the mental errors across the board on offense and defense,\" Rosen said of the team's performance. \"I know I had a bunch. Just little mental errors that aren't a part of the game plan. Dumb little things we just have to clean up overall.\"\n\nWhy is a team making those mistakes 10 games into a season? Nobody seemed to have a good answer.\n\n\"That's why it's an issue that was brought up because it's very late in the season,\" Rosen said. \"That's a good point.\"\n\nIt's been a rough introduction for Wilks to life as an NFL head coach.\n\n\"No. 1, you have to learn how to persevere,\" he said. \"It's tough. You have to learn how to hit the reset button and not linger on things because, once again, one loss can turn into two. I try to pull out the positives and try to learn from the negative stuff and try to get those guys to see the big picture.\"\n\nWilks said he knew it would be a tough job when he was hired.\n\n\"Did I expect to be where we are? No, but again you have to learn how to persevere\" he said. \"You have to learn how to continue to push and be that example. I am not going to quit. That's what I just told the guys, and neither are they. We're going to find a way to get on track and win a football game.\"\n\nArizona was last 2-8 in 2006. That team finished 5-11 and coach Dennis Green was fired.\n\nNotes: The Cardinals released kicker Matt McCrane, who had been signed Saturday and was active for the Raiders game in place of Phil Dawson, who had been bothered by a hip injury. Dawson is fine and will be back this week, Wilks said. ... Wilks said LB Deone Bucannon sustained a chest contusion in the game and it's not known how much time he might miss.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mike Stewart) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nVirginia coach Bronco Mendenhall is embracing the importance of this week's game against Virginia Tech.\n\nThe Cavaliers (7-4, 4-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) finish the regular season in Blacksburg on Friday against the Hokies (4-6, 3-4). The game for the Commonwealth Cup has taken on added importance for both programs in recent days.\n\nThe Hokies have won 14 straight in the series and need to make it 15 in a row to have any chance of extending their 25-year bowl streak, the longest recognized by the NCAA. Virginia Tech also upped the ante a bit on Sunday, announcing that it will play Marshall on Dec. 1 seeking bowl eligibility, but only if it can first beat Virginia.\n\nMendenhall listed beating Virginia Tech as one of the program's primary goals at the start of the season, and his players have taken that message to heart.\n\n\"I basically said everything that they're doing that's not involved in going to class or winning this game is actually not going to help us,\" he said. \"I did give them a choice. I think it gives our team the best chance to be focused, prepared and ready to play the way they'll need to play in a very difficult environment against a good team.\"\n\nIn his first two seasons, Mendenhall was not as blunt about his team's need to beat the Hokies, but with the progress they have made in his third season, he said he saw no reason to understate its importance.\n\n\"It's not just another game,\" he said. \"Virginia hasn't won the game in a significant amount of time. It's an in-state rival game. It's hard to take over a conference until you take over your own state, and certainly then your side of the division. So to say it's just another game, I think we all realize the implications aren't just normal implications. They're at a higher level. So, again, my approach has always been just to state the brutal facts.\"\n\nThe facts from the Hokies standpoint have not been great of late. They will come into the game on a four-game losing streak and having lost four straight at home, but right guard Braxton Pfaff said beating Virginia and getting the seniors another home game would allow them to put the troubles of the difficult month behind them.\n\n\"We're not focused on anything that's happened this last month,\" said Pfaff, a redshirt senior. \"It's been terrible, but this week, this weekend, this win could just erase all that negative things that have happened.\"\n\nThe negatives continued on Monday when wide receiver Sean Savoy announced his intention to transfer. The announcement came one day after redshirt freshman linebacker Rico Kearney said that he, too, is transferring.\n\nCoach Justin Fuente said his staff will show the team videos in which former players talk about the importance of beating Virginia. Fuente has also made the importance of the game very clear.\n\n\"I'll tell them that we're in playoff football,\" Fuente said. \"If we win, we get to play again. If we don't, we're done.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Vance Joseph's decision to tuck his red challenge flag back into his pants pocket loomed large until the Denver Broncos pulled off a last-second win over the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nStill, the failed 2-point conversion early in the fourth quarter of Denver's 23-22 last-second win highlighted a loophole in the NFL rule book that Denver's coach said Monday he'd like to see closed.\n\nLine judge Jeff Seeman ruled Case Keenum came up short on a 2-point draw following Phillip Lindsay's touchdown run that put Denver ahead 20-19 with 12 minutes left, and Joseph said one of the officials told the quarterback his team should challenge the call because it was so close.\n\nReplays appeared to show the nose of the football crossing the goal line just before any part of Keenum's perpendicular body hit the ground.\n\nWhile CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore, a former NFL referee, said during the broadcast that he expected the league would have reversed the on-field ruling if the Broncos had challenged, Joseph said his staff upstairs in the press box wasn't so sure.\n\n\"So, in my opinion it was more important for me to keep that timeout there without having clear evidence,\" Joseph said. \"Now, if it was clear, absolutely we challenge that. But it wasn't clear to our guys upstairs.\"\n\nAnd if his assistants couldn't say with certainty that the call would be reversed, Joseph figured a challenge was unlikely to meet the league's standard of \"clear and convincing\" evidence to overturn the call on the field.\n\nJoseph said on a close call, it would behoove everyone if the officials ruled in favor of the offense because all scoring plays are reviewed by league headquarters, providing a safety net in case they're wrong.\n\nThere are no such protections for coaches who lose one of their timeouts if a challenge is unsuccessful.\n\n\"I couldn't risk the timeout without clear evidence from our guys upstairs if it was a score or not,\" Joseph said. \"Case was told by the official, 'You guys should challenge this because it's fairly close.' I would prefer those guys to call it a score so if it's looked at, we can get it right without risking something from me. Right? Because he has no risk. He has no risk. It's built in to get it right.\n\n\"So, if it's close, they should call it a score so we can look at it \u2014 without anybody risking anything. We just simply get it right. But for me to get it right, there's consequences.\"\n\nJoseph settled for the one-point lead and kept his three timeouts, all of which he used on the Chargers' final possession, helping his offense get the ball back with 1:51 left, trailing 22-20.\n\nKeenum drove the Broncos to the Chargers' 16 and Brandon McManus kicked a 34-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nJoseph said he decision not to challenge on the 2-point conversion play was reinforced when he watched the coaches' video Monday morning.\n\n\"I'm telling you, it can go either way, in my opinion,\" Joseph said. \"It wasn't clear. If it was, he probably would have called it a score.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And for the first time, future round-trip missions would then retrieve those samples and bring them back to Earth, so this landing site sets the stage for the next decade of Mars exploration.\n\nIn 2020, NASA will land the #Mars2020 rover in Jezero Crater where it'll explore the location's story of the wet past of Mars. Conceivably, microbial life could have lived here. If so, signs of their remains might be found in lakebed sediments.

Our NFL insiders across the country break down the biggest takeaways from Week 11. USA TODAY\n\nWashington Redskins quarterback Colt McCoy (12) scrambles against the Houston Texans during the second half at FedEx Field. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe cruelty of professional football struck in Washington on Sunday as Redskins quarterback Alex Smith broke the tibia and fibula in his right leg. Now, Jay Gruden and Co. face the task of quickly regrouping and preparing for a key Thanksgiving matchup in Dallas while trying to maintain their lead in the NFC East.\n\nThe Redskins will put their trust in Colt McCoy, who has spent the last five seasons with Washington, serving primarily as a backup.\n\nWhen McCoy takes the field at AT&T Stadium, he\u2019ll find himself in a familiar setting. The game not only will represent somewhat of a homecoming for the former University of Texas star but also feature the same location and opponent that McCoy faced in 2014 when he got his first start for the franchise, with Robert Griffin III recovering from a fractured and dislocated ankle and Kirk Cousins benched for poor play.\n\nIn that matchup, McCoy completed 25 of 30 passes for 299 yards while leading Washington to a 20-17 overtime victory.\n\nBut now the stakes are higher.\n\nWashington (6-4) clings to a one-game advantage over the surging Cowboys (5-5) and badly needs to rebound from Sunday\u2019s loss to Houston. McCoy\u2019s ability to direct the offense over the next six weeks will largely determine whether the Redskins can earn their first division title and playoff berth since 2015.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big, firm believer in Colt McCoy's ability to play quarterback in the National Football League,\u201d Washington coach Jay Gruden told reporters Sunday evening after announcing the extent of Smith\u2019s injury. \u201cIt's the opportunity of a lifetime for him. I know he would like it in different circumstances, but he'll take full advantage of it.\u201d\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 11 of the 2018 NFL season\n\nMore: NFL Week 11 winners, losers: Cowboys save their season, Jaguars are major disappointment\n\nMore: NFL playoff picture after Week 11: Glut of teams tied for AFC's second wild-card spot\n\nOf course, many might think Gruden has to say such things. McCoy was the only quarterback left on Washington\u2019s roster until the team signed Mark Sanchez as a backup on Monday.\n\nBut Gruden\u2019s support for McCoy is not just lip service. Gruden has long declared that he sees the ninth-year veteran as one of the league's top backups. He has even suggested McCoy could start for some squads.\n\nThe multiple contract extensions totaling $14 million that the Redskins have awarded him since 2015 serve as evidence of Gruden\u2019s faith.\n\nNow, it\u2019s McCoy\u2019s turn to make good on that belief.\n\nWhen Gruden looks at McCoy, he sees a far different player from the 2010 third-round pick, who through three seasons with the Cleveland Browns sported a 6-15 record while throwing 21 touchdowns and 20 interceptions.\n\nInstead, he sees a matured and polished veteran whose poise and level of aggression spark optimism. Gruden sees a player who gets the ball out quickly, isn\u2019t afraid to take shots downfield and also has the mobility to extend plays or scramble.\n\nOthers with a strong knowledge of McCoy\u2019s game agree.\n\n\u201cFrom going against Colt time and time again on scout team, I know he\u2019s a NFL-starter-caliber quarterback,\u201d former Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cHe\u2019s comfortable in his own skin and comfortable in the offense. He\u2019s decisive as a passer. He\u2019ll run when he has to, but he\u2019ll also sit back there in that pocket and give guys a shot to make plays downfield. He can make some great anticipation throws.\u201d\n\nIn a way, McCoy is now getting the opportunity Gruden wanted to give him late in the 2014 season.\n\nHad McCoy not suffered a late-season shoulder/neck injury in the final month of that campaign, he very well may have entered the following season as the starter, Gruden has said. But questions lingered about McCoy\u2019s durability. Cousins emerged from the 2015 training camp as the winner of the starting job and led Washington to the playoffs.\n\nBut Gruden always remained intrigued by the prospect of McCoy as a starter. Following disappointing losses in 2017 when the Cousins-led offense struggled in the red zone, Gruden asked confidants within the building if the outcomes would have been different had the more aggressive McCoy been playing. But Cousins never played poorly enough to warrant a benching.\n\nWhen Washington brass decided not to try to sign Cousins to a long-term deal this offseason, there was a part of Gruden that wanted to use McCoy as a bridge quarterback this season while drafting and developing a prospect for the future. But team president Bruce Allen swung the trade for Smith, and Washington signed the 34-year-old to a four-year contract extension.\n\nNow, however, McCoy will get his chance to deliver on the potential his coach saw. He certainly lacks the experience and resume of Smith \u2013 a 10-year veteran and three-time Pro Bowl selection with a 94-66-1 career record and seven playoff games under his belt.\n\nBut McCoy does provide several reasons for confidence. With five years of experience in Gruden\u2019s system, he has a comfort executing it that Smith lacked.\n\nMcCoy\u2019s bond with Gruden also extends beyond the field. The two have become close personally, even golfing together at times during the offseason. Their many conversations should promote cohesion and understanding.\n\n\u201cI know how Jay sees this offense. I know how Jay wants this offense run,\u201d McCoy said Sunday evening. \u201cI'll do my best to make that happen.\u201d\n\nMcCoy's pre-existing connection with some of Washington\u2019s pass-catchers also should benefit him. The trust factor between Smith and Jordan Reed and Josh Doctson remained a work in progress. But McCoy\u2019s familiarity with the same players was evident by the spark he provided in Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nBecause of these traits, many of those close to McCoy expect to see the quarterback keep Washington afloat. The same people believe it's possible that his aggressive nature may actually help boost an offense that ranks 25th in yards per game (331) and 27th in points (19.7).\n\nThe Redskins need only look at the rival Eagles for a testament of a knowledgeable backup\u2019s capabilities. That\u2019s not to say McCoy is going to pull a Nick Foles and lead Washington to the Super Bowl. But he could at least give his team a fighting chance in the division.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Diana Olick, CNBC", "title": "Rising mortgage rates, home prices are becoming a toxic cocktail in the housing market", "description": "Housing market suffers under rising mortgage rates", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/real-estate/2018/11/19/housing-market-nahb-homebuilders-sentiment-drops-mortgage-rates-rise/2056665002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.wgrz.com/assets/GANNETT/images/3e41a731-35ba-46f4-abf0-166c9c8cbca9/3e41a731-35ba-46f4-abf0-166c9c8cbca9_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:07:53Z", "content": "Rising mortgage rates and continued home price growth are hurting affordability and fast becoming a toxic cocktail for the nation's homebuilders.

(Photo: Steven Senne, AP)\n\nThe long wait for recreational marijuana sales to begin in Massachusetts is almost over with the first commercial pot shops set to open on Tuesday.\n\nIt can hardly be termed a robust launch with only two stores opening initially, in Leicester and Northampton. But they can boast of being the first anywhere in the eastern United States as the commercial cannabis industry looks to expand its geographic base amid increasing public acceptance.\n\nMassachusetts voted to legalize recreational marijuana in 2016, but it\u2019s taken more than two full years to reach this point.\n\nSome things to know:\n\nThe first sales\n\nThe first pot shops will open at 8 a.m. in Northampton, a small city in western Massachusetts, and in the central Massachusetts town of Leicester. Both stores already operate as medical marijuana dispensaries but are the first to be cleared by state regulators to sell recreational pot to adults 21 and older.\n\nThe symbolic first buyers have already been chosen.\n\nNorthampton Mayor David Narkewicz will usher in a new era of legal marijuana in his city by making the first purchase at New England Treatment Access.\n\nStephen Mandile, a disabled Iraq War veteran and medical marijuana advocate, has been chosen as the first to buy at Cultivate in Leicester, The Boston Globe reported.\n\nWhat should shoppers bring?\n\nConsumers will need to show government-issued identification to enter the stores, regardless of how old they are or look.\n\nDriver\u2019s licenses and passports will be among documents accepted.\n\nBringing cash is also a good idea at least during the initial period of legal sales. The federal prohibition on marijuana means that most banks and credit card processors won\u2019t service marijuana businesses.\n\nA spokesman for the Northampton store says it will accept some debit and credit cards with four-digit pins. A spokeswoman for the Leicester store says it will accept cash only during the first hours of sales, though debit may be available later Tuesday.\n\nAre long lines expected?\n\nBased on what happened when other legal states \u2013 and Canada \u2013 launched retail sales, yes.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that crowds will gather when the first stores open. Many people are no doubt eager to be among the first on the East Coast to buy recreational pot legally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to look like one thing on the first day and another thing on the 100th day,\u201d said Norton Albaraez, a spokesman for the Northampton store.\n\nIn other words, anyone not wanting to deal with the initial crowds might consider waiting a few weeks or months for things to settle down.\n\nTo help speed up purchases and move the lines along, the stores suggest that people familiarize themselves with available products on the company\u2019s website before arriving at the store.\n\nWhat will be sold?\n\nMarijuana products come in a variety of shapes, sizes, colors and potency. Much of what is offered can be divided into the categories of cannabis flower, cannabis extract (often referred to as concentrate) and cannabis-infused products.\n\nThe \u201cflower\u201d refers to the part of the marijuana plant that might typically be rolled into a joint (stores also offer pre-rolled joints). It comes in several variations and often with exotic brand names such as Tangerine Haze, Purple Punch and Buddha\u2019s Sister. Strains differ in levels of THC, the psychoactive chemical in marijuana.\n\nConcentrates includes waxes, oils and tinctures. Edibles are the most common form of cannabis-infused products, and often include brownies, chocolate bars, gummies and lozenges.\n\nState regulations limit potency levels for edibles to no more than 5 milligrams of THC for a single serving. A package of edibles can contain no more than 20 individual servings.\n\nHow much can be purchased?\n\nState regulations limit total purchases by a single customer to 1 ounce of flower or its equivalent in concentrate. Stores may also set their own limits, at least in the early going, in the hope of minimizing inevitable supply shortages during the initial sales period.\n\nWeed is still illegal in public spaces so consumers won\u2019t be allowed to sample anything inside the store, or in the parking lot outside the store, or in a public park near the store. It can be used \u2013 legally \u2013 only in homes or other private spaces.\n\nWhat about taxes?\n\nRecreational marijuana sales are subject to Massachusetts\u2019 6.25 percent sales tax, along with a 10.75 percent state excise tax and a 3 percent local tax. That adds up a 20 percent tax paid by the consumer at the point of purchase.\n\nMedical marijuana remains untaxed.\n\nWhen will more stores open?\n\nThe slow rollout of recreational marijuana sales is expected to continue for some time in Massachusetts.\n\nA third store, in the town of Wareham near Cape Cod, has been issued a final license and could open soon.\n\nFor the moment, that still leaves large swaths of the state without easy access to legal recreational marijuana, including all of greater Boston where more than half of the state\u2019s population resides.\n\nWhere else is recreational marijuana legal?\n\nRecreational marijuana sales are legal in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, California and Nevada.

(AP Photo/Woody Marshall) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Pittsburgh coach Pat Narduzzi insists he wasn't making some sort of bold prediction. That he wasn't guaranteeing anything when he told fans at a kickoff luncheon on the eve of the regular season to clear their schedule for a trip to Charlotte for the Atlantic Coast Conference title game on the first Saturday in December because \"that's where we're going.\"\n\nAnd even as Narduzzi's comments raised eyebrows outside of the locker room, they passed without a ripple on the inside.\n\nFor Narduzzi's players, his words were simply the latest in a mindset he has been trying to instill in the Panthers since he accepted the job nearly four years ago: that Pitt has everything it needs to thrive in the ACC.\n\n\"We've been preaching about this since day one,\" senior linebacker Oluwaseun Idowu said. \"He sets a high goal and obviously you want to achieve it.\"\n\nEven if the path the 24th-ranked Panthers (7-4, 6-1) took to their first ACC Coastal Division title \u2014 one they wrapped up with a decisive 34-13 win over Wake Forest on Saturday \u2014 proved more winding than Narduzzi anticipated.\n\nThe team blown off its home field in the second half of a lopsided loss to Penn State, that looked overmatched on the road against Central Florida, that bumbled its way to yet another confounding loss to woeful North Carolina \u2014 all in September \u2014 will play second-ranked Clemson on Dec. 1 for a shot at the school's first outright conference title regardless of what happens Saturday when the Panthers visit Miami (6-5, 3-4).\n\n\"You never put a date on when something like this is going to happen,\" Narduzzi said. \"They're hard to get. There's a lot of good football teams, a lot of good coaches out there. This is hard to get.\"\n\nParticularly the way Pitt has gone about getting it. The Panthers are a throwback of sorts, relying heavily on senior running backs Qadree Ollison and Darrin Hall and an offensive line that has been dominant at times. What they lack in flash they have made up for in fundamentals and relentlessness.\n\n\"Everyone knows this is a special group and everyone showed it every week,\" quarterback Kenny Pickett said. \"We played with a kind of heart and toughness that isn't seen very often in this day and age of football.\"\n\nThe proof came on Oct. 6 against Syracuse. Trailing by three with less than 6 minutes to go and at risk of falling to 2-4, the Panthers didn't shy away from their identity.\n\nIf anything, they embraced it.\n\nEleven straight times Pickett took the snap. Eleven straight times he turned around and handed the ball off to either Ollison or Hall, pushing the ball just deep enough into Orange territory for Alex Kessman to drill a 48-yard field goal to send the game to overtime. Five more snaps in the first extra period produced five more runs and the eventual game-clinching touchdown burst by Hall.\n\nThe Panthers have not looked back. Their lone loss during their 5-1 surge that carried them to Charlotte came on the road against unbeaten Notre Dame, a game in which Pitt led until less than 6 minutes remained.\n\n\"We never lost faith,\" Narduzzi said. \"Somebody else may have, OK, and I don't point any fingers, but we never lost faith. So there's never a point. That's the God's honest truth right there. We never lost faith. There's going to be ups and downs. You can't beat everybody. You can't be perfect. But there's \u2014 I don't think anybody lost faith in this room, and we kept them together, and that's how you have success.\"\n\nNarduzzi has done his best to find a proper balance between letting his players enjoy the milestone without letting them think they've arrived. His message during the team's weekly film review on Sunday night was succinct. Congratulations on taking a step forward, but none of it will matter if you don't get focused on Miami because \"we'll get smacked in the mouth real hard.\"\n\nSomething that hasn't happened in quite a while to a team that revels in its resiliency.\n\nOne of the first game-day traditions Narduzzi started was to have his players raise their hands with four fingers in the air and jump up and down at the start of each fourth quarter.\n\nFour seasons in, the hype party has become ingrained. Pitt has outscored opponents 73-29 in the fourth quarter. One of the reasons the giddy celebration over the weekend felt even more joyous was because the Panthers did it in the way Narduzzi promised them they could if they believed.\n\n\"It's a really big deal,\" Idowu said. \"We've been preaching it for a very long time now ... all the ups and downs we've been through, it's a big deal.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Derek Carr missed Jalen Richard on a third-down pass in the second quarter and immediately heard all about it from coach Jon Gruden as he walked to the Oakland Raiders sideline.\n\nCarr was caught on television yelling right back at his coach in an exchange that repeated itself again in the fourth quarter and prompted many outsiders to point to it as a symbol of how bad things have gotten in this lost season for the Raiders.\n\nTo Carr and Gruden, it's just a regular occurrence between two passionate people that just happened to be caught on camera during a 23-21 win for Oakland (2-8) over Arizona on Sunday.\n\n\"I don't have a 'no yelling' sign on the sideline,\" Gruden said Monday. \"Things happen. We get excited down there. I get excited when we get a first down. Get excited when you work on something all week and it doesn't work out. I get excited when he makes big plays, too. That's just part of football. I think cameras can catch things sometimes that maybe make things look a little bit peculiar, but that happens.\"\n\nThe first run-in between Carr and Gruden happened late in the second quarter when the Raiders went three-and-out after the missed throw down the sideline to Richard. Tight end Lee Smith ended up trying to play peacemaker, grabbing Gruden at one point in what he later acknowledged was a mistake.\n\nCarr was surprised the whole situation became such a big deal.\n\n\"It's not the first time him and I have been that way. We're both very fiery,\" Carr said Sunday. \"A lot of people don't see that in me, right? All the time. We're both very fiery, we're both very competitive. Minor disagreement on something and the beautiful thing is that when we do that, it's never like a demeaning thing, or pointing a finger. It's just, we're both yelling the same kind of thing almost. It's us both saying let's fix it kind of deal. Again, it's not the first time, I doubt it'll be the last time, but everything's good, I promise.\"\n\nThere was only more frustration later in the quarter when Carr called back-to-back timeouts, leading to a delay of game penalty that helped thwart a drive.\n\nThe bickering continued in the fourth quarter after a third-down pass to Seth Roberts came a yard short of a first down, leading to another punt.\n\nGruden said he can be outwardly supportive or critical depending on the situation.\n\n\"I'm a big cheerleader sometimes,\" he said. \"I'm very positive a lot of the time. Every once in a while, I think you have to make your points in some different ways. Sometimes raising your voice. I look ridiculous to some people, but I want urgency. I want to have some urgency to get things right. It doesn't mean I'm always right, either. Derek pointed that out to me yesterday. So be it.\"\n\nThe Cardinals then took the lead on the ensuing drive and the Raiders failed to generate a first down on two straight possessions, leading to rare punts in the final four minutes by a trailing team.\n\nBut thanks to some poor penalties by Arizona and botched clock management, the Raiders got one last chance and made it pay off by driving 63 yards in the final 1:53 thanks to a 32-yard pass to rookie Marcell Ateman and a 20-yarder to Roberts that set up Daniel Carlson's game-winning 35-yard kick.\n\nNOTES: The Raiders placed WR Brandon LaFell (Achilles) on IR and signed WR Keon Hatcher off Green Bay's practice squad. Hatcher had three TD catches for Oakland in the preseason finale. ... WR Saeed Blacknall was released Monday. ... WR Jordy Nelson could return to practice this week after missing a game with a knee injury. ... RB Doug Martin should be OK this week after missing the second half with an ankle injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 James Paxton spent the first two months of the 2016 season in the minor leagues after an awful spring training caused his demotion.\n\nWhen he returned to the majors, he quickly emerged as the Mariners' ace, and now the Yankees hope he can bolster the thin rotation that contributed to New York's loss to Boston in the AL Division Series. New York acquired the 30-year-old left-hander from the rebuilding Seattle Mariners on Monday for top prospect Justus Sheffield and two other minor leaguers.\n\n\"I think I'll be a great fit. They seem very committed to winning, and so am I,\" Paxton said.\n\nNew York sent the left-handed Sheffield to the Mariners along with right-hander Erik Swanson and outfielder Dom Thompson-Williams.\n\nPaxton turned 30 on Nov. 6 and went 11-6 with a 3.76 ERA in 28 starts last season, including a 16-strikeout start against Oakland on May 2 and a no-hitter at Toronto six days later. He struck out 208 and walked 42 in a career-high 160 1/3 innings, allowing 23 home runs.\n\nPaxton is 41-26 in six major league seasons, making six trips to the disabled list in the last five years. He missed nearly four months with a strained left latissimus dorsi muscle in 2014, 3\u00bd months with a strained tendon in left middle finger in 2015, 10 days with a bruised left elbow in 2016, 3\u00bd weeks with a strained left forearm and a month with a strained left pectoral muscle in 2017, and 2\u00bd weeks with lower back inflammation this year.\n\n\"I continue to try to work towards being healthy for an entire season,\" he said. \"All the injuries that I've had haven't reoccurred. I've learned how to make sure those things don't happen again through exercise or whatever.\"\n\nWhen he went to Triple-A two years ago, he worked with former big league pitcher Lance Painter, who told him to drop his arm angle back to three-quarters. When Paxton returned to the Mariners, he studied reading swings with pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre Jr.\n\n\"It's taken me a little longer I think in my career because I have had so much time off,\" Paxton said. \"But having those larger chunks the last couple years has really allowed me to come into my own and really make some big strides, and I look forward to continuing to make big strides in my game. And I think that my best baseball is still to come.\"\n\nA proud Canadian born in a fishing village in the suburbs of Vancouver, British Columbia, Paxton is also known for keeping his composure as a bald eagle mistakenly landed on his shoulder prior to a start at Minnesota in April.\n\nHe joins a rotation projected to include right-handers Luis Severino and Masahiro Tanaka and left-hander CC Sabathia. General manager Brian Cashman wants to add at least one more starter, address the shortstop opening created by Didi Gregorius' elbow surgery and add to his bullpen.\n\nPaxton made $4.9 million last season and is eligible for salary arbitration. He can become a free agent after the 2020 season.\n\nIn his one game at Yankee Stadium, Paxton entered with a 10-start unbeaten streak and allowed two-run homers to Aaron Judge and Miguel Andujar in the first inning of a 4-3 loss on June 21 this year.\n\nSeattle decided to rebuild after going 89-73 and finishing third in the AL West, 14 games behind division-winning Houston and six back of Oakland.\n\n\"Clearly we've opted 2019 be a year that we take a step back hoping to take two forward,\" general manager Jerry Dipoto said. \"When I say 2020 and 2021, it's simply gauging the ages of the players we're building around here.\"\n\nSheffield is rated among the top minor league prospects, made his big league debut in September and pitched in three games for the Yankees. He had a 2.48 ERA in 25 minor league appearances at Double-A and Triple-A this year, striking out 123 in 116 innings and allowing just four home runs.\n\nSheffield had just finished playing golf when he saw Cashman's number on his cell phone.\n\n\"Definitely caught me by surprise,\" Sheffield said.\n\nSheffield won't turn 23 until May and could become a future anchor to Seattle's rotation.\n\nSwanson, 25, started the year at Double-A Trenton but spent most of 2018 at the Triple-A level with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where he made 13 starts and had a 3.86 ERA. Swanson had 78 strikeouts and 14 walks in 72 1/3 innings in Triple-A. He pitched 121 2/3 total innings last season overall and was rated among the top 25 prospects in the Yankees organization by MLB.com.\n\n\"I think both of them are going to compete for a spot in the rotation,\" Dipoto said. \"We absolutely expect to see both guys before the summer is through in Seattle and they will start cutting their teeth here and hopefully set us up for what we think will be a pretty exciting group as we enter 2020 and 2021.\"\n\nThompson-Williams, 23, has never played above Class A and will turn 24 next April. He had 22 home runs, 20 stolen bases and a .299 average across two Class A affiliates this year.\n\nCashman is aggressively pursuing pitching from outside the organization, even after Sonny Gray flamed out during 1 1/3 seasons with New York, shaken by repeated booing at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\"I can't tell you we've learned anything further other than we drill down as much as we can, whether with players that have played with somebody as teammates that we know or coaches who have coached or people who have managed or anybody, whether it's all the way back in the amateur ranks,\" Cashman said. \"We just try to ask a lot of questions about how they compete. This environment can bring out a different experience for some. So I don't have a new secret formula to address predictability on who will thrive and survive and who won't here in New York.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tim Booth in Seattle contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Howard Simmons) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSyracuse coach Dino Babers offered little on quarterback Eric Dungey and a lot on the Orange's third loss of what has been a breakthrough season.\n\nDungey was injured in the first quarter Saturday in a 36-3 setback to No. 3 Notre Dame at Yankee Stadium and never returned to the sideline. Dungey, third in total offense in the Atlantic Coast Conference (2,901 yards), finished just 1-of-4 passing for 10 yards with one interception and rushed twice for another eight.\n\nBabers said Monday he was hopeful Dungey would be available for the 19th-ranked Orange's season finale at Boston College on Saturday. He had no update on Dungey's status \u2014 it was announced as an upper-body injury \u2014 but added the senior was able to get into a hot tub on his own Sunday.\n\nThe lopsided loss to the Irish sent the Orange plummeting seven spots in the AP Top 25 and short-circuited their late-season surge to land a prized spot in the postseason. Still, since an overtime loss at Pittsburgh in early October, Syracuse (8-3, 5-2 ACC) had won four straight conference games to move into second place in the Atlantic Division behind powerhouse Clemson (11-0, 8-0), ranked second nationally.\n\n\"The thing I look at most in the second half of our season is we've got one loss,\" Babers said. \"We have an opportunity to go 5-1 on the back half. I think the biggest thing is seeing if we can make that happen.\"\n\nThe injury to Dungey exposed a weakness against a step up in competition. Backup Tommy DeVito, a redshirt freshman who's had plenty of reps in both spring ball and preseason camp and success in two games this season, didn't fare so well against the Irish. A New Jersey native, DeVito was 14-of-31 passing for 105 yards with two interceptions and was sacked six times.\n\n\"It was a big blow because we didn't play well,\" Babers said. \"Notre Dame was really, really good and they played really, really well. It's one thing to lose when you play well. It's another thing to lose when you don't play well. That's a fantastic football team. I'm not sure if we could beat them if we played well.\n\n\"We had an opportunity, but we didn't match the opportunity of playing well on that stage.\"\n\nBabers noted the difference in performance between his seasoned older players and newcomers with raw talent who faltered. Wideout Taj Harris led the Orange with five catches for 78 yards and now has 33 receptions, tied with Shelby Hill (1990) for the most in program history by a freshman. But Harris also bobbled a pass from DeVito on a crossing route late in the first half and the ball caromed to Notre Dame safety Alohi Gilman, who returned it 54 yards to set up a touchdown.\n\nThe Irish had been held to a pair of field goals on consecutive drives and the Orange were driving when the turnover occurred.\n\n\"It seemed like a lot of the younger players didn't play as well as the older players,\" Babers said. \"That's disappointing for the seniors because it was such an opportunity for them, and that opportunity will never come again.\n\n\"This was our first really big game on a national stage outside of our venue. Didn't play well,\" Babers added. \"Next time we'll have that experience in our back pocket. We're moving through stages here, and we're moving a little bit quicker than what we anticipated, and that's OK.\"\n\nSyracuse is ranked for the first time since 2001 and had not been ranked this high since it rose to No. 11 in October 1998 in Donovan McNabb's final season.\n\nAfter three straight 4-8 finishes, this season has been a significant turnaround.\n\n\"I think that we're ahead of schedule, and I think it's really cool,\" said Babers, in his third season. \"There's a light on the program. People are looking, people are watching. I think we're at an exciting point if we continue to get better. We can't stay the same, and we're getting to the point where we're being more consistent, which is good.\n\n\"That gets me giddy. We're getting closer to what I envision this thing being, and the young men are working very hard to get there.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 All season, Indiana coach Tom Allen told his players they needed to find a finishing touch.\n\nHe pointed to the handful of close calls in 2017, each a potential win that could have made the Hoosiers bowl-eligible. Instead, their offseason began shortly after Thanksgiving and now the Hoosiers find themselves facing the exact same predicament as last year: Beat Purdue on Saturday or the season is over early \u2014 again.\n\nAllen is eager to see how much of a difference his season-long message makes.\n\n\"It's critical that we completely finish the season here with game No. 12 at home,\" he said. \"I was up front with them again today. We know what's at stake, and we know that the winner gets to go play in a bowl game and the loser gets to stay home, so that's what we're playing for.\"\n\nAnd now Purdue coach Jeff Brohm has joined the chorus.\n\nAfter a rollercoaster season, which includes three wins over ranked teams along with losses to Eastern Michigan and Minnesota, the Boilermakers also must win to reach the postseason.\n\nWhile it's certainly not the ideal predicament, it is one Brohm hopes his team will embrace as they play for a postseason ticket for the second straight season.\n\n\"It's one of those games that you really dream about playing,\" Brohm said Monday during his weekly news conference. \"I think our guys will get back to work this week and understand this is a game that means a lot to our school and to our fan base, and we've got to go out and try to find a way to win it.\"\n\nBoth teams had chances to avoid this situation.\n\nIndiana (5-6, 2-6 Big Ten) went toe-to-toe with Ohio State, challenged Penn State at home, tied Minnesota late and then led for most of Saturday's game at Michigan. They wound up losing all four.\n\nPurdue (5-6, 4-4) lost twice in September on game-ending field goals, charged back into the Big Ten West race with upsets over the Buckeyes and Iowa and then stumbled against Michigan State, played poorly at Minnesota and blew a 14-point, fourth-quarter lead against Wisconsin. Saturday's triple-overtime loss was Purdue's third defeat in four games.\n\n\"We've had our chances in quite a few games this year,\" Brohm said. \"We haven't been able to finish, and then for the most part we've responded.\"\n\nBut as much as Brohm continues to talk about the task at hand, the speculation continues to swirl about Brohm's future in West Lafayette.\n\nBrohm spent most of last week's news conference answering questions about the opening at his alma mater, Louisville, dealt with another torrent of questions following Thursday's practice and even wound up batting away a question on whether all the talk made an impact on Purdue's preparation for Wisconsin.\n\n\"No, not at all. Our guys trust me to do a great job,\" he said, wrapping up the postgame news conference.\n\nRegardless of this weekend's outcome in Bloomington, the chatter will almost certainly crank up over the next week.\n\nBrohm has turned things around quickly at Purdue and never missed the postseason in his first four seasons as a head coach \u2014 a streak he hopes to keep intact even as the Cardinals are expected to make the hard sell to the hometown kid who looks like the perfect successor to Bobby Petrino.\n\nFor the moment, though, Allen and Brohm remain both focused on the same goal: Finishing the regular season with a crucial sixth win.\n\n\"A lot is on the line, and our players understand that,\" Allen said. \"So we had a great start to the week, and very much looking forward to the schedule we have.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Banks) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAGAN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 The NBC camera on Minnesota's pregame huddle in Chicago captured Kirk Cousins delivering the customary pep talk to his teammates, a full-throated reminder by the quarterback that the Vikings reached the NFC championship game last season, not the Bears.\n\n\"They're not the reason this game moved to prime time,\" Cousins shouted. \"We are.\"\n\nSoon after the opening kickoff, though, the Vikings (5-4-1) wilted in the spotlight of the NFL's showcase Sunday night game. The offense didn't score until 7 seconds were left in the third quarter, and the defense gave up a season-high 148 rushing yards, leading to a 25-20 loss that wasn't as close as the score.\n\nThe Vikings fell 1\u00bd games behind the Bears (7-3) in the NFC North, meaning they'll have to win once more than the surprise division leader over the next five games to make the rematch on Dec. 30 count toward the race.\n\nChicago plays the Los Angeles Rams (9-1) on Dec. 2, but that's at home. Every other opponent has a losing record. Minnesota has back-to-back road games against the New England Patriots (7-3) and Seattle Seahawks (5-5) looming.\n\n\"The schedule's the schedule. I'm not worried about that,\" coach Mike Zimmer said.\n\nWhat most troubled Zimmer were the three turnovers, a failure to reach the end zone on the first three trips inside the 20-yard line, and a total of 22 rushing yards on 14 attempts . His message to the offense in meetings throughout the week was that those three areas would determine the outcome.\n\n\"Either they're not listening or they're not paying attention or they don't really care,\" Zimmer said. \"So we'll have to find out which one of the three it is.\"\n\nThe defense also had a 15-yard penalty on two of Chicago's three drives for field goals.\n\nCousins said the defeat \"certainly humbles you,\" a potential positive to take in preparation for the next game against the rival Green Bay Packers (4-5-1). The Vikings have already had several of those sobering defeats this year, from the lopsided loss at home against the lowly Buffalo Bills to the 556 total yards allowed to the Rams to the gaffes that precipitated their fall against the New Orleans Saints.\n\nWhether there's some natural regression in the works after their 13-3 regular-season record in 2017, a few flaws they haven't yet fixed or a little bit of bad luck, the Vikings have been a hair off and a step behind from the start this year despite adding Cousins to one of the league's deepest rosters.\n\nIn facing the Rams, Saints and Bears in nationally televised night games, the top three teams in the NFC, the Vikings have performed like a wild-card team at best.\n\n\"We're a good team. We know that. It's just about going out there and doing it. Quit talking about it,\" linebacker Eric Kendricks said. \"Just getting back to work, putting our hard hats on and no excuses. We've got to point the finger at ourselves, so we've just got to get the job done, period.\"\n\nThe Vikings have 16 turnovers, seventh most in the NFL after producing at least one in all but one game. That's already two more than last season, when they had the third fewest in the league.\n\n\"That's what we talk about every single day since OTAs, talk about protecting the football,\" wide receiver Adam Thielen said. \"The percentage of you winning a football game when you lose a turnover battle is pretty low. We know that. We have to go back to work and figure it out.\"\n\nThe Vikings finished in the top seven in the NFL in fewest turnovers in each of Zimmer's first four years.\n\n\"It's been frustrating at times,\" Zimmer said, noting the unlikelihood of some of the giveaways like Thielen's fumble against the Saints that turned that game around: He added: \"I guess stuff happens sometimes.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

After he was wheeled off the court and taken to the back of the arena, medical staff popped his foot back into place \u2014 the most painful part of the whole experience, LeVert said. He was taken to a hospital for further tests that night, learned there was no other major damage, and he wound up flying home with the Nets that night.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm very blessed, because it could have been a lot worse,\" LeVert said.\n\nLeVert was having a breakout season for Brooklyn, with seven 20-point games already \u2014 matching the total from his first two full seasons in the NBA. He was averaging 18.4 points per game, which leads the Nets, and was posting career-best averages in scoring, rebounds and assists, along with a career-high shooting percentage from the floor.\n\nThere's no timetable for LeVert's return, but the Nets say his coming back at some point this season is the expectation.\n\n\"Initially, I was frustrated, felt kind of defeated,\" LeVert said. \"I felt like it wasn't fair. But everything happens for a reason. It's not a very, very, very serious injury to the point where the way I play basketball will be different. I feel like I'll still be the same player. I'll be a better player when I come back. I feel like maybe the time off is the best thing for me, maybe best for the team.\"\n\nLeVert said his spirits were boosted by so many fans and players reaching out to him on social media. He said some players also got his phone number and sent texts, though he isn't sure how some of them got the number.\n\n\"It's been great,\" LeVert said. \"It's been overwhelming, for sure.\"\n\nBrooklyn visits Miami on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Coach Ed Orgeron makes it clear that he doesn't see LSU's regular-season finale at Texas A&M on Saturday as just another game on the schedule.\n\nWhile LSU's hopes of sneaking into the College Football Playoff are slim at best, a victory would give the No. 8 Tigers their first 10-win regular season in six years while virtually assuring LSU a spot in a prestigious \"New Year's Six\" bowl game. The Tigers have not participated in one of these upper-tier post-season games since losing to Alabama in the national title game at the end of the 2011 season.\n\n\"Obviously, this is a very big game for our program,\" Orgeron said. \"Getting ten wins and playing in a New Year's Six bowl would be a huge step in building a championship program and getting LSU where it needs to be.\n\n\"A win this week would give us a chance to win 11 games. You have to take it a step at a time. I remember at Southern Cal that we went 6-6 and then 11-2. The next year we were (national) champions.\"\n\nAn additional story line exists in this game against the Aggies, who are attempting to finish with a winning Southeastern Conference record for the first time since 2012. First-year Texas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher was a candidate to be former LSU coach Les Miles' replacement a few years ago.\n\nThere was much talk about Fisher, a former Tigers offensive coordinator under Nick Saban and Miles from 2000-06, being hired at the end of the 2015 regular season. However, LSU officials decided to retain Miles.\n\nFour games into the 2016 season, Miles was fired. Fisher and current Texas coach Tom Herman were widely reported to be ahead of Orgeron on LSU's wish list at that time. Orgeron recalled the circumstances when the Tigers met the Aggies two years ago in College Station.\n\n\"I'm a defensive lineman,\" Orgeron said. \"I know that it is not always the first one who gets the date. Things happen for a reason. Two years ago when we played at Texas A&M, I didn't know what was going to happen.\n\n\"On Wednesday, it was Jimbo Fisher. On Thursday, it was Tom Herman. On Saturday, Ed Orgeron got the job. I see why (LSU) wanted Jimbo Fisher. He's an excellent coach. I see why (LSU) wanted Tom Herman. He's an excellent coach. I'm glad I am here. I am happy to have the job.\"\n\nThe Tigers defeated the Aggies 54-39 on Thanksgiving night in College Station in 2016. Two days later, Orgeron was promoted from interim head coach to full-time head coach. Since that day, Orgeron has led LSU to a 19-6 record.\n\nBesides needing a victory to play on New Year's Day, the Tigers will attempt to extend their seven-game winning streak against Texas A&M. LSU defeated the Aggies in the Cotton Bowl following the 2010 season and beat them in all six meetings since they joined the SEC.\n\n\"Whether they have beaten us or we have beaten them will mean nothing for the game this week,\" Orgeron said. \"We won't talk about going to a New Year's Day bowl game. I don't need to talk about that. This is our final game and we have to finish strong.\n\n\"It is about playing Texas A&M, playing LSU ball and being physical. We have to win the game in the trenches. We have done it on the road (at Auburn) and we haven't done it on the road (at Florida). This is a critical game. We have to play like a top-ten team.\"\n\nOrgeron acknowledged that Texas A&M under Fisher has a different mindset than the one under former coach Kevin Sumlin.\n\n\"This is a completely different Texas A&M team,\" Orgeron said. \"Our players will see the film and understand they are not the team we've been beating the last few years. They are a much more physical team on both sides of the ball.\"\n\nEach year, two of the New Year's Six bowls double as CFP semifinals \u2014 the Cotton and Orange bowls this season. The best of the rest will play in the lucrative Fiesta, Peach, Rose and Sugar bowls. The last time LSU played in the Peach Bowl in 2012 (losing to Clemson), that game was not yet part of the six bowls that have been in the CFP rotation since the four-team playoff's inaugural season in 2014.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They're optimistic because they are in control of their fading playoff hopes in a mediocre NFC East. But there's nothing positive to point at following a dismal loss to the Saints (9-1).\n\n\"You can't hang your head,\" coach Doug Pederson said Monday. \"If anybody does, and if anybody begins to sort of doubt, you don't need them. Because we believe, and I believe in those players, I believe in those coaches. It's a group that is hurting. It's a group that will pick themselves up this week. They're not going to feel sorry for themselves and we'll get ready for the Giants.\"\n\nThe Redskins (6-4) lead the division but just lost quarterback Alex Smith for the rest of the season. They'll face the Cowboys (5-5) for first place on Thursday. The Giants (3-7) visit Philadelphia on Sunday. If the Eagles win the last six games, they'll secure the East. But they look more like a team that can lose out than win six in a row.\n\nCarson Wentz played the worst game of his career in New Orleans, tossing three interceptions with a 31.9 passer rating. The offense managed only one touchdown, went three-and-out six times and continued spiraling downward. It barely resembles the group that outperformed the Patriots 41-33 in the Super Bowl.\n\nRunning backs Jay Ajayi (torn ACL) and LeGarrette Blount (left in free agency), wide receiver Torrey Smith (traded to Carolina) and tight ends Trey Burton (left in free agency) and Brent Celek (released) are the skill players missing from that unit, along with Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles, who is Wentz's backup. Undrafted rookie Josh Adams is the lead running back but the receiver corps was upgraded with the addition of wideout Golden Tate and rookie tight end Dallas Goedert.\n\nYet, the offense has been out of sync all season. The Eagles have scored more than 24 points only once.\n\nPederson was bothered more by the offense's performance against the Saints because Drew Brees and Co. have run through defenses all season.\n\n\"We had more plays out on the field that we left, so that's the disappointing thing, that we didn't do a better job offensively and score more points,\" Pederson said. \"The 48, they're a good football team. Let's not kid ourselves there. That's a good football team, and we knew we were going to have to score points.\"\n\nThe offense's biggest problem has been slow starts. The Eagles have scored only 21 points in the first quarter, including 14 in one game. Against the Saints, their three first-quarter possession were two three-and-outs and an interception thrown into double coverage.\n\n\"We keep preaching. We keep talking. We keep practicing. We put our players in those positions to execute,\" Pederson said. \"Sometimes I think because there's been so much made about the way we've started games differently than a year ago that sometimes you want to make the play. Players just need to make the plays that come to them and don't go looking for plays. There's enough out there that when the play comes, you make it, and it starts with the first play of the game.\"\n\nNOTES: Pederson said CB Rasul Douglas (leg) and DB Avonte Maddox (knee) and C Jason Kelce (elbow) are fine. CB Sidney Jones (ankle) and LB Jordan Hicks (calf) are week to week. LS Rick Lovato is in concussion protocol.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 No different than most days, Kurt Roper made his way over to the Colorado quarterbacks for practice.\n\nBig difference from most days, the QB coach is now running the show on an interim basis after the firing of Mike MacIntyre .\n\nOne of Roper's first orders of business Monday was a brief team meeting to discuss the situation with MacIntyre, who was let go with three years left on his contract and with the team in a six-game skid.\n\nThen, the focus went right back on preparing for California (6-4, 3-4 Pac-12) \u2014 a team the Buffaloes (5-6, 2-6) need to beat on the road to become bowl-eligible for the second time in three seasons.\n\n\"Really, what I tell them is this isn't about coaches. This is about these guys in the room,\" Roper said. \"The expectations are unquestioned effort. That's what they will give us.\"\n\nThere's a motivational component, too \u2014 for MacIntyre, the 2016 AP coach of the year who led the Buffaloes to a 5-0 start before the wheels came off.\n\n\"What we do know for a fact is he'd want us to finish the season well,\" senior linebacker Drew Lewis said. \"Ideally, we want to do it for him and I can feel for that. Just finish this last game with a win and secure the bowl game is the most he could ask for as far as us.\n\n\"He was never the stingy coach. When he was asked to leave, I bet you he wasn't pointing fingers or anything of that nature. He's definitely still hoping for the best for us. We know he's going to be watching us and we're going to try to do it for him.\"\n\nIt's been a tumultuous weekend for the Buffaloes following their 30-7 loss to Utah on a snowy Saturday afternoon. A day later, athletic director Rick George informed MacIntyre he would not return and then met with the coaching staff and players. George appointed Roper as the interim coach.\n\nRoper's task is injecting some energy into a skidding Buffaloes team in hopes of salvaging a soured season.\n\n\"The first five games was really an enjoyable experience for the whole team. It bonded everybody together,\" Roper said. \"The last six weeks have been tough. But I don't think that's been able to separate us. They've done a great job all year long.\"\n\nTailback Travon McMillian didn't so much sense a new sort of energy from the team Monday, only a renewed sense of purpose.\n\n\"No matter what, guys are busting their tails to try to get a win,\" said McMillian, who has 951 yards rushing this season. \"It did feel different having Roper leading the team. Other than that, I mean, no matter what, guys are trying to win. No outside factors are going to motivate us to do better.\"\n\nThe rumors have been circulating about MacIntyre's job status since last week. All the outside noise has been difficult to weather, especially for receiver Jay MacIntyre, the son of Mike MacIntyre.\n\n\"I know that burden he feels is definitely heavy,\" Lewis said. \"He said yesterday one thing that stuck with me, that this is the first time in all his years he's walked into that team meeting room and his dad wasn't there. That hit home. He's going through a lot right now. We're all doing a really good job of sticking up for him.\"\n\nThis could be an issue: Roper might not have his most trusted pupil Saturday in Berkeley. Quarterback Steven Montez left the Buffs' loss to Utah with a sprained right ankle. He's listed as day-to-day.\n\n\"He's a tough guy and obviously wants to play,\" said Roper, who spent a good portion of practice Monday with the QBs.\n\nAs for mending the emotions of his team, Roper cited the resiliency of players.\n\n\"What happened affects everybody differently,\" Roper said. \"The good thing about this 12th opportunity is it gives us a chance to have a 13th opportunity. We want to go play a really good game against Cal and hopefully extend our season if we can play well.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Arnie Stapleton contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Scott Frost's first Nebraska team is in position to finish with one more win than the Mike Riley-led Cornhuskers had a year ago.\n\nThat would be no small accomplishment. The Huskers (4-7, 3-5 Big Ten) were the last Power-Five conference team to win this season following a program-worst 0-6 start. To close on a 5-1 run, they must win Friday at Iowa (7-4, 4-4), which has outscored Nebraska 104-44 while winning the last three meetings.\n\nIt really has been a tale of two seasons wrapped into one.\n\nThere were close losses to Colorado and Troy, the blowout loss at Michigan, a penalty-filled home loss to Purdue, a good effort that came up short at Wisconsin and the blown 10-point lead in the last five minutes at Northwestern.\n\nThen there were wins over Minnesota and Bethune-Cookman, a close loss at top-10 Ohio State, and wins over Illinois and Michigan State.\n\n\"There were a lot of things that had to be addressed,\" athletic director Bill Moos said. \"One of them of course, was the culture, and also our self-image. We had to embrace the new system, the new coaches, and that takes a while. In a transition period there can be doubters when you start to lose. Scott did a great job of keeping this team together and steadily improving until we got a win, which was what we needed to cure it. And then we created momentum.\"\n\nWith the exception of the Ohio State game, the schedule has been easier the second half of the season. The 9-6 win over Michigan State \u2014 albeit a Spartans squad missing key players to injury \u2014 was the most impressive of the season because the maligned defense stood up on a snowy day when it was tough to accomplish much on offense.\n\n\"You don't have to know a lot about football to know we're playing better the second half than the first,\" Frost said. \"We gave ourselves chances to win games in the first half of the season. We didn't do the little things right to make them happen. We're starting to do some of those things.\"\n\nAdrian Martinez is one of the top freshman quarterbacks in the nation, Devine Ozigbo has made himself into the school's first 1,000-yard rusher since 2014 and Stanley Morgan Jr. and JD Spielman are threatening or already have broken school receiving records.\n\nThe defense and special teams have been prone to errors, but both have improved late in the year.\n\n\"That's kind of the way it should be,\" defensive lineman Mick Stoltenberg said. \"You should continue to get better. I'm really impressed that even at 0-6, guys weren't blinking. Guys were still confident, and they still wanted to win and definitely thought we'd be able to make that bowl game. The confidence in this team has continued to rise despite some early struggles.\"\n\nMuch of the improvement stems from how the players have taken to the new coaching staff. Under Riley, individual agendas were common, work in the weight room slacked, and there was a tendency for players to give up when times got tough.\n\nPlayers say Frost emphasizes accountability on and off the field, unity of purpose and an embrace of one of the most ardent fan bases in the country.\n\n\"If you look at how much we've grown, it's not only physically and mentally but as a team and relationship-wise, getting close to each other, loving your brother, fighting for your brother,\" offensive lineman Tanner Farmer said. \"We've grown a lot, almost immeasurably.\"\n\nThe way the Huskers have played the second half of the season makes Martinez wistful.\n\n\"I wish we could have been playing like this at the beginning of the year,\" he said. \"Things would be a little bit different. But it is what it is, and we have another opportunity this week to play another good team and show people this is who we are now.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The match ended 2-2. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe Netherlands' recovery from one of the lowest ebbs in its history continued with a last-gasp qualification for the Final Four of the inaugural UEFA Nations League on Monday.\n\nVirgil van Dijk volleyed home a 90th-minute equalizer to seal a dramatic Dutch comeback in a 2-2 draw in Germany, allowing Ronald Koeman's rejuvenated side to top its qualifying group on goal difference ahead of France, and join fellow group winners Portugal, England and Switzerland in a five-day finals competition in June.\n\nSo instead of seeing Kylian Mbappe, France's new wonderkid and star of the team's World Cup triumph in Russia in July, vying for another piece of international silverware, soccer fans will get to see if the Netherlands truly has turned the corner.\n\nThe slump of the Dutch has been profound since they finished third at the World Cup in Brazil in 2014. They failed to qualify for an enlarged European Championship in 2016 and also didn't make it to the World Cup this year.\n\nThree coaches \u2014 Guus Hiddink, Danny Blind, and Dick Advocaat \u2014 came and went. And with Dutch soccer at club level also in strife, debate swirled as to how one of the long-time heavyweights of the world game could recover.\n\nUnder Koeman, though, the future of the Oranje looks bright. Youngsters like center midfielder Frenkie de Jong and center back Matthijs de Ligt are regarded as two of the most promising players in the world; Memphis Depay and Georginio Wijnaldum have returned to their best form over the last 18 months; and, in Van Dijk, the Netherlands has one of the best defenders around.\n\nA rock for Liverpool this season and last, Van Dijk \u2014 soccer's most expensive defender following his $99 million move from Southampton in January \u2014 sidefooted in a cross from the left to follow up an 84th-minute goal from Quincy Promes that gave the Dutch a glimmer of hope in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nThe Germans had gone 2-0 up after 19 minutes thanks to Timo Werner's dipping shot from 25 meters and Leroy Sane's deflected effort from just inside the area. They couldn't hold on, though, and finished group play with no wins, just two points, and in something of a crisis.\n\nThey didn't get out of their group in Russia in a dismal defense of their World Cup title, while relegation to League B of the Nations League \u2014 featuring Europe's second-tier teams \u2014 had already been confirmed after failing to win any of their first three group games.\n\nGermany coach Joachim Loew opted to stay in the job after the World Cup, but is now under mounting pressure.\n\nThe Nations League, a new competition devised by UEFA to replace unpopular international friendlies with competitive matches between teams of a similar level, appears to have won over the skeptics, and the lineup for the Final Four is intriguing if hardly a marketer's dream.\n\nPortugal, which will be playing on home soil, has a superstar in Cristiano Ronaldo who should be back in the team after an extended absence from international soccer since the World Cup.\n\nEngland has Harry Kane, the top scorer at the World Cup, and a talented, dynamic group of young players under forward-thinking coach Gareth Southgate.\n\nSwitzerland, which hasn't reached a quarterfinal of an international tournament since 1954, will be the outsider.\n\nThe Netherlands, at No. 15, will be the lowest-ranked team in the competition but should not be discounted. This victory came three days after the team produced one of its best performances in years to beat France 2-0, while it beat Portugal 3-0 in March and Germany by the same score at home in the Nations League.\n\nThe draw for the Final Four, which comprises of two semifinals and then a third-place playoff and final, will take place in Dublin on Dec. 3.\n\nSome other loose ends were tied up in the Nations League, which offers teams a second chance to qualify for the European Championship in 2020.\n\nThe 16 group winners in Leagues A, B, C and D \u2014 or the next best-placed teams who have not already qualified via the European qualifiers starting in March \u2014 will progress to the Nations League playoffs and compete for the last four qualifying places for Euro 2020.\n\nNORWAY, MACEDONIA PROMOTED\n\nNorway was promoted to the second-tier League B after finishing top of Group C3 with a 2-0 win at Cyprus. The Norwegians started the final round of group play tied for points with Bulgaria, which could only draw at home to Slovenia 1-1.\n\nMacedonia went up to League C after beating Gibraltar 4-0 to top Group D4. Armenia, the only team that could have finished above Macedonia, ended up second after drawing at Liechtenstein 2-2.\n\nSLOVAKIA RELEGATED\n\nSlovakia was relegated to League C after losing at neighbor Czech Republic 1-0, with Patrik Schick scoring the winner in the first half with a deft lob over the goalkeeper on a counterattack.\n\nDenmark was already guaranteed promotion to the top tier and Ireland was sure of being relegated before they drew 0-0 in Aarhus.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: YORGOS LANTHIMOS/20TH CENTURY FOX)\n\nVery rare indeed is the Oscar-ready costume drama that features duck racing, bunny birthday parties and one supporting actress contender chucking books at the other's head.\n\nDirector Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 wild take on the stuffy period piece is an 18th-century hoot that marries \u201cMean Girls\u201d-level insults and slapstick humor: Before the movie really even gets going, Emma Stone face-plants into mud after being thrown out of a carriage \u2013 and that's far down the list of her most bonkers situations. As hilarious as it is, \"The Favourite\" (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of four; rated R; in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expanding through December) doesn\u2019t skimp on impressive costuming and production design, and the film gamely tackles class and gender themes, as well as partisan politics, in its tale of women behaving badly and men being nitwits.\n\nMore: Emma Stone's 'Favourite' audition was (almost) as weird as the film itself\n\nAlso: Finally, an Oscar for Viggo? Mortensen shines a light on 1960s-era racism in 'Green Book'\n\nThe tragicomedy is set in England during the era of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), a gout-ridden sovereign who suffers from insecurity, shyness and mad fits of rage, usually aimed at random servants.\n\nBecause of her issues, the country is run primarily by Lady Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), a focused and powerful figure who\u2019s been Anne\u2019s best friend since childhood and is now the queen\u2019s most trusted adviser (and secret lover). Sarah also doesn\u2019t suffer fools, not even reigning ones: When Anne goes a little heavy on the eye makeup, the queen\u2019s BFF tells her in withering fashion, \u201cYou look like a badger.\u201d\n\nAn ambitious scullery maid, Abigail (Emma Stone) seduces her way into the queen's heart in \"The Favourite.\" (Photo: ATSUSHI NISHIJIMA/20TH CENTURY FOX)\n\nEngland is in some tumult at the time because of the war with France \u2013 plus the conflicting ideologies of the Whigs and Tories \u2013 and chaos begins to infiltrate the palace with the arrival of the bewitching Abigail (Stone). Sarah\u2019s cunning cousin is clawing her way back to aristocracy after her side of the family has fallen on cash-strapped hardship and disfavor.\n\nAbigail is first assigned to be a scullery maid, but her charm enchants Sarah and then Anne, creating a love triangle that lands Abigail in the royal bedchambers. The newcomer becomes an ally for scurrilous Tory leader Robert Harley (a scene-stealing Nicholas Hoult), who wants to use Abigail\u2019s connections to the throne to end the costly war, and Abigail also sees marriage to dim-bulb Baron Masham (Joe Alwyn) as yet another way to climb the ranks.\n\nYour ultimate Thanksgiving movie guide: A slam dunk for every holiday scenario\n\nPreview: 10 movies you must see this holiday season, from 'Fantastic Beasts' to 'Mary Poppins'\n\nFair warning for historical purists: Much of the real Anne\u2019s reign is a mystery, but it\u2019s safe to say there wasn\u2019t breakdancing at courtly shindigs. The beauty of Lanthimos\u2019 filmmaking, like with the romantic absurdity of his dark comedy \"The Lobster,\" is how he turns weird, self-aware storytelling into entertaining, audience-friendly cinema. There\u2019s not a lot of subtlety in the stately shenanigans of \"The Favourite,\" though the ending is potentially polarizing for some with its metaphorical meanings.\n\nRobert Harley (Nicholas Hoult, center) is a Tory leader who wants to use his royal connections for political gain in \"The Favourite.\" (Photo: YORGOS LANTHIMOS/20TH CENTURY FOX)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine the cast being better, especially with how the film pits Stone\u2019s conniving, street-smart Abigail against Weisz\u2019 more polished but savvy Sarah.

Terrill, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 World Series MVP Steve Pearce says it was a \"no-brainer\" to return to the Red Sox for another year.\n\n\"This was the place that I wanted to be,\" he said on a conference call Monday, three days after agreeing to a $6.5 million, one-year deal with the defending champions. \"The chemistry we had on and off the field, wanting to defend a title, that's a big deal.\"\n\nA 35-year-old journeyman who has played for seven teams \u2014 including the entire AL East \u2014 in a 12-year career, Pearce arrived in Boston at the end of June and spent most of this time with the Red Sox platooning at first base with Mitch Moreland.\n\nPearce batted .279 in 50 games for Boston in the regular season, hitting seven homers \u2014 five of them against the New York Yankees, including three on Aug. 2. In five World Series games against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he batted .333 with three homers, two of them in the Game 5 clincher, to earn MVP honors.\n\n\"The team I was on, everything that was done there, bringing everybody back, it was a no-brainer for me,\" Pearce said. \"We just played different. It was great chemistry on this team, it's where I wanted to play.\"\n\nRed Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said he is glad to have Pearce and Moreland back for another year. Moreland is also scheduled to make $6.5 million next season, when he will turn 34.\n\n\"We like where we are with Mitch and Steve at first base,\" Dombrowski said when asked if the team considered a multiyear deal for Pearce. \"We really felt for us, where we are as an organization, where they are in their careers, we really did want to hold it to one year.\"\n\nAlso Monday, Dombrowski said that second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who missed all but three games last season with knee injury, is not expected to need surgery. The 2008 AL MVP will rehab through the middle of December and start running in January.\n\n\"We're hopeful he'll be ready for the season,\" Dombrowski said, adding that the plan meant the team probably would not have room for Ian Kinsler to return. \"With that prognosis, we're really as far as positional players pretty well set.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Michigan won 31-20. (AP Photo/Tony Ding) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Michigan running back Karan Higdon pondered the question for a moment, smirked and glanced up at tight end Zach Gentry next to him. Then Higdon leaned forward to the microphone and predicted a Michigan victory over Ohio State.\n\nIt was the shot heard across the Midwest on Monday as the hype machine chugged to life for the 115th edition of The Game. The annual clash between the rivals is being played Saturday at Ohio Stadium, where Higdon just assured himself an even frostier welcome than usual.\n\nThere is a precedent for such prognostication, of course, albeit a generation ago.\n\nHigdon's coach, Jim Harbaugh, famously predicted a win over Ohio State as a player in 1986 and then backed it up, leading the Wolverines to a 26-24 win in Columbus.\n\nHarbaugh, who hasn't been able to beat Ohio State in his first three tries as Michigan coach, insists he doesn't remember much about that prediction now . He had nothing but positive stuff to say about Ohio State on Monday. His counterpart, Urban Meyer, likewise kept talking about \"respect\" for Michigan and the rivalry, and said he would never engage in trash talk.\n\nIf the two coaches were trying to keep the lid on the hype and bad blood, Higdon pried it off.\n\nThe question went like this: \"Would you go as far as Jim Harbaugh did and guarantee that Michigan will beat Ohio State?\"\n\nHigdon thought about for it a couple seconds.\n\n\"Yeah, I do,\" said the senior from Sarasota, Florida . \"That's how I feel. I believe firmly in my brothers, my team, this coaching staff. And as a captain, I'll take a stand. Why not?\"\n\nMaybe Higdon watched video of Ohio State's game on Saturday.\n\nThe Buckeyes allowed Maryland, behind a backup quarterback, to roll for 535 total yards and 51 points. Ohio State eked out a win only because Terrapins quarterback Tyrrelle Pigrome misfired on a 2-point conversion try in overtime. Final score: 52-51.\n\nMeyer said there have been some \"uncomfortable and direct\" conversations with coaches about the sorry state of the defense, but there isn't time this week for a bunch of finger-pointing.\n\n\"We watched (the video) with the defense,\" he said. \"It was just not good.\"\n\nFortunately for Meyer, Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins Jr. is directing the second-most prolific offense in the country. On Saturday, Haskins and Co. will run into the nation's best defense, though Wolverines defensive end Chase Winovich is injured and may or may not be available. Don't ask Harbaugh to be clear about it, either. He's not going to help.\n\nAs usual in this game, the stakes are high. The Big Ten East and a chance to play in the conference championship game hang in the balance. If Michigan wins out, it will be in the College Football Playoff. Another win over Michigan and a possible conference championship would help make everything sunnier for Ohio State after a season of inconsistency, underachieving and off-the-field problems.\n\nOther Michigan players might not be predicting victory but there is confidence in Ann Arbor.\n\n\"It's not just our coach, we're also winless, too, against this opponent,\" said Tyree Kinnel, a sophomore safety from Huber Heights, Ohio. \"We know that. Now we're here for this week, and it's a game we have all been waiting for. Now, we have the opportunity in our hands to go change it, and we feel very confident about that.\"\n\nOhio State finds itself in an unfamiliar position of coming into a game as the underdog amid talk that it just might not have the firepower this time to take down Michigan.\n\n\"We don't talk about those things,\" Meyer insisted. \"It's really about the game. We have a saying around here that the most prepared team will win the game. It's not who's favored and who's not. I didn't know that, and I don't imagine our team really does, I guess. If they (do), they're looking at the wrong stuff.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Larry Lage contributed from Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Additional officers arrived at the scene and engaged the gunman for several minutes inside the hospital.\n\nLess, the pharmacy resident, was shot as she walked out off an elevator, Johnson said.\n\n\"That woman got off an elevator and was shot, why?\" Johnson asked.\n\nPatrick Connor, who is head emergency medicine at Mercy, said O'Neal, 38, who grew up in nearby Portage, Indiana, was \"simply one of the most fascinating, hard working people.\" Less, a recent graduate from Purdue University, had been at the hospital since July, Connor said.\n\nJohnson said it was not clear if the gunman was killed by police gunfire or a self-inflicted wound.\n\nSteven Mixon, an emergency room clerk, told the Chicago Tribune that he was waiting outside the hospital for an Uber when he saw O'Neal \u201cbeing harassed by some gentleman.\" He said she waved to him to come to her.\n\nMixon said he didn't make it to her before the gunman began shooting.\n\n\u201cI guess it wasn\u2019t my time to go because if I had made it to her, I would have been dead too,\u201d Mixon said.\n\nJimenez, who was married and a father of three, had just ended his required probationary term with the department.\n\nAnother officer was hit by a bullet in his holster during the chaotic exchange but was not seriously injured, police said.\n\nKevin Graham, president of Chicago\u2019s Fraternal Order of Police union, praised the fallen officer.\n\n\u201cToday, the Fraternal Order of Police lost a valued brother \u2014 a courageous police officer who got up this morning, went to work and wanted to protect the city of Chicago,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe did just that, but he did so with his life.\u201d\n\nJohnson said he was certain the police\u2019s quick response saved many lives. Jimenez and his partner were not assigned to the call but responded anyway.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that all those officers who responded are heroes,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSteven White, a patient at the hospital who had been waiting to be discharged, said the shooting started near the emergency room entrance.\n\n\u201cIt was, 'Pow, pow, pow,' '' said White, who was treated for dehydration at the hospital.\n\nWhite said he could see through the window the woman lying on the ground.\n\n\"You see stuff like this on TV, but to see someone so coldhearted,\u201d White said. \u201cIt was like he had no remorse.\u201d\n\nThe gunman ran into the building, and a police officer chased him. As bystanders took cover, White said, he heard the gunman fire at least six shots.\n\nToday, we mourn Chicago Police Officer Samuel Jimenez. His heroic actions saved countless lives. He ran toward danger. He ran toward those shots. He ran into fire. Selflessly.\n\n\n\nSamuel Jimenez: altruism personified. #OfficerDown#NeverForgetpic.twitter.com/7IDW4sJr6v \u2014 Chicago Police (@Chicago_Police) November 20, 2018\n\nPharmacist Joan Fortune said she and colleagues were talking to a patient near the emergency room entrance when the gunfire erupted.\n\nA technician immediately pulled down security shutters and barricaded several people in their work area, Fortune said.\n\n\u201cWe heard more gunshots and arguing,'' Fortune said. \u201cWe stayed barricaded for about 30 minutes until the police (arrived), and we ran out a back (exit).\u201d\n\nMonique Hubbard, a technician in the pharmacy, said she heard several gunshots before and after she and others barricaded themselves.\n\n\u201cAt one point, we could hear him shake the security shutters,\u201d Hubbard said.\n\nMercy Hospital officials said that employees went through an active shooter drill just last month.\n\n\"A hospital should be a safe place,\" Connor said. \"Every shooting in America is a tragedy. It is a national tragedy. It is especially senseless when a shooting occurs in the healing space of a hospital.\"\n\nChicago recorded 762 murders in 2016 and 650 in 2017. The city had recorded 488 murders for 2018 as of Nov. 11, more than any other U.S. city but an 18 percent decline from last year.\n\nJimenez was the second Chicago Police officer to be slain in the city in 2018, and the 48th officer shot and killed in the line of duty across the country this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks such deaths.\n\nIn February, Cmdr. Paul Bauer, a veteran of more than three decades in the Chicago force, was fatally shot while confronting a man who had run from police officers, during an incident in downtown Chicago.\n\nMercy Hospital and Medical Center is a 292-bed surgical Catholic teaching hospital that was established in 1852.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/19/chicago-hospital-shooting-reports-multiple-victims-mercy-hospital/2060629002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Bryan Alexander, USA TODAY", "title": "'Dancing With the Stars' finals: Can Bobby Bones actually win while 'clueless at dance'?", "description": "Bobby Bones is the least-skilled dancer going into the 'Dancing With the Stars' final on Monday.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Perfection is elusive, even for Nick Saban's best teams at Alabama.\n\nThe top-ranked Crimson Tide heads into Saturday's regular season finale against rival Auburn still chasing Southeastern Conference and national titles. An unblemished record remains in play, too, though that's been even harder to obtain.\n\n\"Coach Saban voices that to us that he's had only one undefeated team around here and he's had how many championships,\" Tide center Ross Pierschbacher said Monday. \"It's possible to lose one and still win a championship but he just wants us to not have that bump in the road, to still be able realize what we have in front of us.\n\n\"We don't have to lose a game to kind of wake up. We should always be ready.\"\n\nMaybe that wakeup call came with a 10-10 halftime score against The Citadel , an FCS team. Alabama (11-0, 7-0 SEC) wound up running away with it, 50-17, but not without uneasy moments that included fumbling the second-half kickoff.\n\nThe Tide is a 24-1/2-point favorite against the Tigers (7-4, 3-4). But Auburn spoiled 'Bama's bid for a perfect season a year ago, winning 26-14 to claim a spot in the SEC title game.\n\nAlabama has already locked down a matchup with No. 5 Georgia in Atlanta this time.\n\nSaban has led the Tide to five national championships over the last nine seasons, but only one perfect record, in 2009. Alabama hasn't needed to be win them all, having twice captured national titles after failing to win the SEC West, including last season.\n\nWinning the national championship helped lessen the sting of losing the West plus state braggin' rights, but not remove it altogether.\n\n\"I think the players all know what happened last year,\" Saban said. \"I think they don't feel great about it. They didn't feel good about last year. They've had to live with it for 365 days.\n\n\"I don't necessarily think that the revenge factor is the best form of motivation out there, but I think it certainly plays into a guy that's a good competitor who wants to come back and do well if he didn't perform well the last time he played someone.\"\n\nAlabama doesn't necessarily have to beat both Auburn and Georgia to make the playoffs after dominating virtually every game, though the Tide would like to avoid leaving its fate in doubt again.\n\nAlso, for a team that's gone 136-14 over the past 10-plus seasons, going unbeaten would be one way to stand out in the Saban era.\n\nThe 2009 team won the first national title under Saban in Tuscaloosa and went 14-0, but had more close calls than this group. That included a 26-21 win over Auburn.\n\nThe Tide scored the final 13 points and capped a 15-play drive with Greg McElroy's 4-yard touchdown pass to Roy Upchurch with 1:24 left.\n\nPerfection may not be easy, and neither is winning the Iron Bowl.\n\n\"That's always the goal, to win every game,\" Pierschbacher said. \"For me to go out my senior year, I think that would be something pretty special, to go 15-0.\"\n\nNotes: Tailback Damien Harris has made \"really good progress\" since sustaining a mild concussion on a 73-yard run in the fourth quarter against The Citadel, Saban said. He's still going through concussion protocol before being cleared to practice. ...

And we have to change it.\"\n\nRichardson is Miami's leading scorer this season, averaging 20.1 points through the season's first 16 games.\n\nAlso Monday, the Heat revealed that point guard Goran Dragic had fluid drained from his right knee and is expected to miss the next three games, including a two-game trip to Chicago and Toronto.

The 31-year-old actress said she did so to prevent postpartum depression and stop the post-birth bleeding.\n\nDuff isn't the only celebrity \u2013 or mom, for that matter \u2013 to devour the organ that's shared between mother and fetus. In May, Chrissy Teigen ate placenta after giving birth to her son. Kim Kardashian West, Katherine Heigl, Alicia Silverstone and January Jones are all believers, too.\n\nSo how are moms consuming placenta?\n\n1. A pill\n\nClaudia Booker, a midwife and placenta encapsulationist, uses a sieve while grinding dehydrated human placenta into a powder that will be made into a pill. (Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nYou can have your placenta made into pills by a specialist. They dehydrate the organ, grind it up into a powder and put it into capsules. All packaged up and ready for you to pop. You'll be happy to know you'd be joining celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Katherine Heigl who have also opted for this method.\n\n2. Soup\n\nOne Los Angeles food critic decided to take his wife's raw placenta, cut it up and make a brothy soup based off a Chinese chicken soup recipe.\n\n3. In a smoothie\n\nWomen such as actress Hilary Duff are consuming placenta in the form of a smoothie. (Photo: dolgachov, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIf you want to follow in Hilary Duff's footsteps, then a good old placenta smoothie to start your day might be the way to go. The \"Lizzie McGuire\" star chose to freeze it into ice cubes and use it in her blended drink, but you can even plop it in there raw. A Google search for \"placenta smoothie recipes\" populates with plenty of ideas if you need some help figuring out what fruits and vegetables pair well.\n\n4. Boozy drink\n\nIf you need some liquid courage to down your placenta, fret not, you can garnish your favorite alcoholic beverage with some afterbirth. Following the birth of Tamera Mowry's son, the twin pressured her sister, Tia, to try her placenta brandy mixture.\n\n5. Tacos\n\nYou can cook placenta and make it into a taco. (Photo: TobinC, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nPlacenta tacos, anyone? Nick Baines, a British food and travel writer, decided to go ahead and fry up his wife's placenta with some seasonings and make tacos. He said it was \"kind of like roast brisket.\"\n\n6. Whatever your heart desires\n\nGiven the multitude of recipes online, the placenta appears to be a very versatile ingredient. It can be cooked into pretty much anything, whether it be lasagna or sweet placenta truffles.\n\nYou can eat placenta, but should you?\n\nAlthough there's inadequate scientific evidence backing claims that consuming afterbirth is beneficial, a growing number of parents are advocates of eating the organ, citing health benefits such as increased energy and milk production and preventing postpartum depression.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not have recommendations when it comes to eating the organ.\n\n\"ACOG has no guidance on eating placenta because there is no real scientific data behind it,\" Megan Christin, the director of media relations and communications, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, warns that consuming placenta may cause harm to your newborn. The Oregon Health Authority documented a case in 2016 of an infant developing late-onset group B Streptococcus agalactiae as a result of the mother ingesting contaminated placenta pills.\n\nThe CDC went on to state that there is inadequate scientific evidence backing claims that consuming afterbirth is beneficial and advises against taking placenta pills because the process does not get rid of harmful pathogens, like salmonella, that can make you or your baby sick.\n\nAlthough doctors and health agencies seem to generally advise against consuming the placenta, some organizations advocate for the benefits of it.\n\nCathy Daub, president of BirthWorks International, a nonprofit that certifies doulas and childbirth educators, said other cultures have used placenta to treat colic, whooping cough, diseases of the heart and circulatory system, menopause, skin conditions and breastfeeding.\n\n\"In the United States, even though placental medicine is not recognized, we would do well to respect the wisdom of cultures who have found its use beneficial and develop a new respect for the healing effects this amazing human organ has to offer us,\" said Daub.\n\nLike All the Moms?

This has caused the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural causes.\n\nIn addition to the unsettling results of his study, Mora told the Sydney Morning Herald that \"it was also mind-blowing that we just refuse to wake up about how serious this is.\"\n\nTo better understand the threats we face, Mora and his colleagues reviewed more than 3,200 scientific papers and found 467 ways that climate change has affected all aspects of human civilization and the Earth itself.\n\nIn other words, by the end of the century, folks will have to endure not just one or two climate hazards, but potentially three, four or more at the same time. Coastal regions in tropical areas will see the most, according to the study.\n\nFirefighters hold a line in the Camp Fire with a control burn Near Bloomer Hill in Butte County in California on Nov. 14, 2018.

By that time, Los Angeles will deal with three.\n\nAlthough the scientists discovered few positive or neutral effects, the overwhelming majority of climate impacts are detrimental to humans.\n\n\"If we only consider the most direct threats from climate change, for example heat waves or severe storms, we inevitably will be blindsided by even larger threats that, in combination, can have even broader societal impacts,\" study co-author Jonathan Patz of the University of Wisconsin said.\n\nThe study was published Monday in Nature Climate Change, a peer-reviewed British journal.\n\nThere is a new culprit in the greenhouse gas wars.

(AP Photo/Martin Meissner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) \u2014 A dramatic comeback sent the Netherlands to the UEFA Nations League finals after ending Germany's nightmare year with yet more disappointment in a 2-2 draw on Monday.\n\nThe comeback meant the Dutch \u2014 who missed the last European Championship and World Cup \u2014 qualified ahead of world champion France to join England, Switzerland, and Portugal in next year's inaugural Final Four.\n\nAt 2-0 down to Germany in the 85th minute, Dutch hopes of reaching the Nations League finals looked long gone.\n\nBut Quincy Promes curled a shot past Manuel Neuer, and defender Virgil van Dijk \u2014 playing as a makeshift striker \u2014 volleyed in a second for the point the Netherlands needed. For all the talk of their young players, the Netherlands' more experienced personnel made the difference.\n\nAfter failing to qualify for two consecutive major tournaments, the Netherlands was widely considered the favorite for relegation in the Nations League when drawn against Germany and France in January.\n\nWith Ronald Koeman in his first year as coach and Ajax's Matthijs de Ligt and Frenkie de Jong giving the team a shot of youthful energy, the Netherlands' campaign proved it once again belonged with the continent's big names. At home, the Dutch beat Germany 3-0 and new world champion France 2-0, but struggled to maintain the same form away until the last five minutes of Monday's game.\n\nGermany had already been relegated to League B, capping a year coach Joachim Loew called \"a slap in the face\" after a group-stage exit at the World Cup. Some in the stands called for Loew to step down after 12 years in charge, though his team dominated most of the game against the Dutch before the sudden late collapse.\n\nThe Germans showed sublime skill for Timo Werner's ninth-minute opening goal, Serge Gnabry flicking the ball for the striker to head on before unleashing a powerful low shot from long range.\n\nOne of the Netherlands' much-heralded young talents, defender de Ligt, was at fault for the second goal. Faced with Leroy Sane struggling to control the ball, de Ligt mistimed his challenged entirely, leaving Sane to hit a shot which took a deflection off Kenny Tete.\n\nGermany couldn't find a third goal to finish off the Netherlands, though Gnabry went close with a header in the 40th and Werner dragged a shot wide in the 63rd.\n\nThe Dutch sprang to life in the dying minutes.\n\nIn the 85th, Germany failed to clear the ball and ignored Promes lurking on the edge of the penalty area. When the ball finally reached him, he had plenty of time to send a curling shot to the top-right corner past Neuer's outstretched arm.\n\nWith nothing to lose, defender and captain Van Dijk went up front as a makeshift forward, using his height and strength in the buildup to his dramatic leveler. Tonny Vilhena picked up the ball on the right flank and sent in a cross which glanced off a German head for Van Dijk to volley past the exasperated Neuer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: RMHC)\n\nWhen a child\u2019s life is spent in and out of hospitals, the presence of family can make a world of difference. Togetherness for these families is nothing short of precious, but it\u2019s not as simple as just being there. The best thing parents can provide is not just their physical presence, but stability and resolve in the face of hardship \u2013 which under the circumstances can be taxing to provide.\n\nStacy Woelfel, mother to 4-year-old Caroline Woelfel, knows this better than most. Along with her husband Kyle, Stacy makes the trek from their rural home to the hospital at least once a month so that their young daughter Caroline can receive routine medical care.\n\nBorn with a hole in her heart, 4-year-old Caroline suffers from several underlying conditions including chronic fatigue, autonomic dysfunction and the need for leg braces. As such, life never been quite normal for the Woelfels. Stacy and Kyle must be the rock Caroline needs, a task that is infinitely easier when they can be fully present for their daughter in mind, body and spirit. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a lot,\u201d said Stacy, \u201cbut we also have a lot of support.\u201d\n\nMuch of this support has come in the form of Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC\u00ae), an organization devoted to helping families like the Woelfels stay together and get the resources they need to cope and thrive. More than just a refuge, RMHC gave the Woelfels a place to stay, decompress and find solace near their daughter between those long trips to the hospital and back. It is a base they can return to without worrying about the logistics.\n\n\u201cRonald McDonald House\u00ae is here so we can have our base, and be with our child,\u201d Stacy said. \u201cWe have the freedom to come when we need to. It\u2019s so important. Caroline will never be alone in this. Never.\u201d\n\nSupport from charitable causes like RMHC helps to alleviate some of the intense emotional and financial toll families like the Woelfels experience. By providing housing and spaces near hospitalized children and covering the expenses of staying together in distant cities, RMHC provides critical stability and resources to those in need. Its impact is felt keenly every day by patients and their families \u2014 and made possible through the generosity of its donors.\n\nHelp give the gift of togetherness today.\n\nSick children need great care, without a doubt. But their families need it too, and it is this holistic notion of care for the whole family that RMHC has embedded into its mission.\n\nIn fact, an international survey of 530 hospital leaders with Ronald McDonald House program affiliations found that most leaders believed that caring for the whole family contributes to better outcomes for pediatric patients. The Ronald McDonald House allows families to get this care through better sleep, reduced feelings of isolation and assistance with food and transportation.\n\nRonald McDonald House Charities, which operates in more than 64 countries and regions with over 360 local Ronald McDonald House programs, delivers on this promise every day. Along with its other core programs, RMHC saved families over $880 million in out-of-pocket lodging and meal expenses in 2017 alone.\n\nFor families like the Woelfels, support from RMHC manifests as much more than a monetary savings. \u201cCaroline calls [the House] her \u2018safe place\u2019 where she knows she won\u2019t be poked and prodded,\u201d Stacy said. \u201cThe staff gives her high-fives and encouragement as we head to the hospital. And then she comes back and tells them how she was so brave.\u201d\n\nThe Woelfels don\u2019t take time together for granted, and neither do the Jolivards, another family that has received support from RMHC.\n\nWhen doctors told Daniel Jolivard\u2019s parents he needed a bone marrow transplant, he was put on hospice care immediately. After his transplant, Daniel\u2019s father Junior took him to his appointments, hours from their home, while his mother Rachel stayed back and worked, unable to be present for her son.\n\n\u201cWe were soon introduced to the Ronald McDonald House just across the street from the hospital where we could all be together on weekends and holidays,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cDespite ongoing struggles or even the roughest of days, when we are with each other, there\u2019s always happiness.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its convenience, Ronald McDonald House has become a valuable support network, Rachel explained: \u201cThe other families in the House have become a part of our own family, giving that much more support for Daniel as he battles back.\u201d RMHC also has given Daniel the opportunity to spend more time with his brother, always a cause for celebration. \u201cNothing else matters when I see the boys\u2019 smiles and excitement in being together,\u201d Rachel said.\n\nStacy Woelfel, daughter Caroline and her sisters laugh and smile together. (Photo: RMHC)\n\nAlongside its Ronald McDonald House programs, RMHC has over 240 Ronald McDonald Family Room\u00ae programs: comfortable, functional spaces in hospitals where families can rest and regroup during hospital visits.\n\nSince its start in 1974, RMHC has assisted kids and their families, today with the support of 508,788 volunteers. Its work also extends beyond hospitals to help children in vulnerable communities, where over 50 Ronald McDonald Care Mobile\u00ae programs provide medical and dental care.\n\nDaniel and Caroline represent just two of the millions of children and families helped every day by RMHC. But the organization can\u2019t do it alone; their life-changing programs depend on donations large and small which fund these initiatives directly.\n\nOn days like Thanksgiving, Giving Tuesday and Christmas, times when extra emphasis is placed on generosity and togetherness, donors to Ronald McDonald House Charities can be confident in their impact on real families like the Woelfels and Jolivards. 87 cents of every dollar spent by the global office of RMHC is used to fund RMHC programs in local communities across the globe. 90% of the top children\u2019s hospitals in the world provide access to one or more RMHC programs, which, a strong majority of hospital administrators agree, play a significant role for families.\n\nThe combined impact of many small gifts from compassionate donors has brought about tangible returns. \u201cDonors who have supported our stay at the House have given [my family] peace, comfort, joy, courage and strength,\u201d Rachel Jolivard said. \u201cI cannot think of anything more important than being by my son\u2019s side to help him fight, to comfort him and to celebrate those special moments and small victories.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s for Giving Tuesday, the holidays or in memory of a loved one, charitable donations help families stay together in the spirit of the season. What\u2019s more, year-end gifts come with the added bonus of tax savings. Those that give and itemize their donations before December 31 will receive a deduction if eligible come Tax Day 2019.\n\nFor Stacy and Caroline Woelfel, RMHC donations represent the hope and happiness shared by families every day, even in the face of great uncertainty. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future holds,\u201d Stacy said. \u201cTo be together now, in this moment, is everything.\u201d\n\nIn the end, kids like Caroline and Daniel need many things to battle their illnesses, but the steadfast presence of their families will always top this list. With togetherness, the rest can follow.\n\nGive the gift of togetherness to families in need by donating to Ronald McDonald House Charities today.\n\nMembers of the editorial and news staff of the USA Today Network were not involved in the creation of this content.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/ronald-mcdonald-house-charities/2018/11/16/families-sick-children-ronald-mcdonald-house-charities-donors-give-gift-togetherness/38537867/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Touchdown Wire", "title": "Who is the third best team in the NFC?", "description": "The answer should be pretty obvious, right?

The Bears have the third best record in the NFC. They have the third best record in the NFC. They have a solid lead in the NFC North. It\u2019s the Bears . . . except, there are a lot of questions: What happens if bad Mitch Trubisky shows up like he did a few times last night against the Vikings? Is the Bears defense really dominant without Khalil Mack? They gave up 38 points to the Patriots and 31 points to the Dolphins when Mack was out. If they lose him, they are in trouble \u2014 of course, that could be said for any team losing a start. So the Bears are obvious and we will get to them last, but let\u2019s look at some contenders for the third best team in the NFC.\n\nWashington Redskins (6-4, First in NFC East)\n\nHonestly is the best policy here. The Redskins would have been in the argument for the third best team in the NFC if they didn\u2019t just lose Alex Smith to a season-ending leg injury yesterday. Yes, I trust Alex Smith more than I trust Mitch Trubiskt in a playoff game. Trubisky is more likely to make a back-breaking mistake. Smith doesn\u2019t take enough chances to do so.\n\nThe Redskins defense is solid. They are losing players on their offensive line like it\u2019s going out of style, but they hung in the game yesterday versus a very good Texans team. I don\u2019t trust Colt McCoy to be effective over a long period of time.\n\nDallas Cowboys (5-5, Second in NFC East)\n\nThe Cowboys could now be the best team in the NFC East. That puts them in the running for the third best team in the NFC. The Amari Cooper trade sure did something to this team. They look more fluid on offense. Ezekiel Elliott is turning into an MVP candidate at this point. He literally carries the Cowboys offense.\n\nWhat\u2019s more impressive is the young, fast, and tenacious Cowboys defense. It is difficult to move the ball on them. Leight Vander Esch and Jaylon Smith give a speed dynamic to the linebacking corps that might be tops in the NFL right now.\n\nThis Cowboys team is starting to prove they are for real . . . of course that means Jason Garrett gets outcoached by Jay Gruden on Thanksgiving and the Redskins grab a firm grasp of the NFC East.\n\nSeattle Seahawks (5-5 Record, Second in NFC West)\n\nThe Seahawks were fourth in league DVOA going into their game against the Chargers in Week 9 \u2014 which the Seahawks promptly lost. But, then the Seahawks turned around on a short week and defeated the Packers at home in what was essentially a playoff game.\n\nHere\u2019s why the Seahawks could beat the Bears \u2014 or any other team on this list \u2014 they have a proven quarterback, a solid running game, and a very good defense. That\u2019s all teams need in the playoffs. The Bears only have the edge in one of those categories right now \u2014 with their topped ranked defense.\n\nThe Seahawks could make a case that they are the team no one wants to face in the playoffs. Yes, I know the Bears beat the Seahawks, but that was back in Week 2.\n\nCarolina Panthers (6-4, Second in NFC South)\n\nThe Panthers are falling apart their last two games. They got smoked by the Steelers on a Thursday Night game in Pittsburgh. Then, they got beat by a listless Detroit Lions team with nothing to play for. This same team was complaining they had to practice in the snow one day this week. The Panthers need to start winning games they are supposed to win.\n\nThe Panthers have the experience the Bears lack. They have a better quarterback. Christian McCaffrey is better than Tarik Cohen. They have a coach who has been in the playoffs before. They have an interesting offense with Norv Turner.

This has caused the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural causes.\n\nIn addition to the unsettling results of his study, Mora told the Sydney Morning Herald that \"it was also mind-blowing that we just refuse to wake up about how serious this is.\"\n\nTo better understand the threats we face, Mora and his colleagues reviewed more than 3,200 scientific papers and found 467 ways that climate change has affected all aspects of human civilization and the Earth itself.\n\nIn other words, by the end of the century, folks will have to endure not just one or two climate hazards, but potentially three, four or more at the same time. Coastal regions in tropical areas will see the most, according to the study.\n\nFirefighters hold a line in the Camp Fire with a control burn Near Bloomer Hill in Butte County in California on Nov. 14, 2018.

By that time, Los Angeles will deal with three.\n\nAlthough the scientists discovered few positive or neutral effects, the overwhelming majority of climate impacts are detrimental to humans.\n\n\"If we only consider the most direct threats from climate change, for example heat waves or severe storms, we inevitably will be blindsided by even larger threats that, in combination, can have even broader societal impacts,\" study co-author Jonathan Patz of the University of Wisconsin said.\n\nThe study was published Monday in Nature Climate Change, a peer-reviewed British journal.\n\nThere is a new culprit in the greenhouse gas wars. Bitcoin and other blockchain activities use enough energy that they are a threat to lowering energy consumption.

Baltimore won 24-21. (AP Photo/Gail Burton) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Head coach Marvin Lewis fired the defensive coordinator and installed himself in a dual role. Bengals players talked about their trip to Baltimore as a pivotal moment in the season, almost a last-stand opportunity. They wound up getting run over.\n\nNow what?\n\nA 24-21 loss in Baltimore on Sunday dropped the Bengals (5-5) three games behind Pittsburgh in the loss column for the AFC North lead with only six weeks left in the season. Their fourth loss in five games put them in danger of missing out on the playoffs for the third straight season.\n\nA shakeup of the coaching staff didn't make enough of a difference. Cincinnati is relegated to hoping that some of its injured players return and salvage a season that's gone from promising to unsettling.\n\n\"Everyone is frustrated,\" offensive coordinator Bill Lazor said Monday. \"Everyone's nerves are a little frayed right now. Everyone is searching.\"\n\nLewis decided to fire defensive coordinator Teryl Austin after the Bengals gave up 500 yards for the third straight game, a first in the Super Bowl era. He took over the coordinator's duties and hired fired Browns head coach Hue Jackson to help on the sidelines during games.\n\nIt didn't go well in Baltimore.\n\nThe Bengals ended that streak of 500-yard games, holding the Ravens to 403, but they were on the wrong end of more defensive history.\n\nCincinnati allowed 265 yards rushing, the most during Lewis' 16 seasons as head coach. They've given up more than 200 yards rushing in back-to-back games \u2014 the Saints ran for 244 \u2014 and three times overall this season, also the most under Lewis.\n\nRavens rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson ran for 117 yards in his first start, and rookie Gus Edwards ran for 115 and a touchdown. They're the first set of rookie quarterback and running back teammates to run for at least 100 yards in the same game in NFL history.\n\n\"You give up 200 yards rushing, I'm not going to be happy with that,\" Lewis said.\n\nLewis was satisfied with how his first game on the sideline unfolded, although he felt \"somewhat a little handicapped\" by having so many responsibilities.\n\n\"Hopefully it will become more and more comfortable,\" Lewis said.\n\nPart of the reason for Austin's firing was the confusion on defense, which repeatedly had coverage breakdowns. The Bengals had a different type of challenge on Sunday with a rookie quarterback who ran a lot.\n\nLewis simplified the game plan, but the defense still struggled against the run.\n\n\"He made us play fast,\" cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick said. \"He put us in situations where we didn't have to do a whole lot of thinking.\"\n\nThe Bengals were in control of the division after a 4-1 start. Now they're trying to make up a lot of ground on the Steelers, who won at Paul Brown Stadium to start Cincinnati's free fall.\n\nThey're one of five teams at 5-5 in contention for the second wild card spot. The Chargers have the edge for the first wild card at 7-3. The Bengals host the Browns (3-6-1) on Sunday.\n\n\"It's a race now, and that's what we're here for,\" Lewis said after the game. \"That's the thing: Now it's a race to the finish.\"\n\nA race they once led, but that's now getting away from them.\n\nBURFICT BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT\n\nLinebacker Vontaze Burfict played with a sore hip that sidelined him the previous week. He was on the field for 36 of 79 plays, showing the effects of the injury \u2014 he had only four tackles. He also was involved in an altercation with guard Marshal Yanda after a play, part of a scrum on the ground involving several players. The officials didn't penalize anyone. Lewis said on Monday that the coaches' film doesn't show what happened in the altercation.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

New York, which was going through tough times, had a surprising 17-12 lead.\n\nWith the Eagles void of timeouts, all the Giants had to do was run out the final minute on the clock. Joe Pisarcik, a young quarterback, botched a handoff with veteran Larry Csonka with less than 30 seconds to play, and cornerback Herm Edwards picked up the loose ball and ran it into the end zone, giving the Eagles a stunning win.\n\nEagles fans call it \"The Miracle at the Meadowlands.\"\n\nFor Giants fans, it was one of those moments you never forget what you were doing. For some, it still stings.\n\nGiants co-owner John Mara says it might be his least favorite play and the low point in franchise history, which dates to 1925. He was in his third year of law school at Fordham and was working the game for CBS at Giants Stadium in the broadcast booth as a spotter for play-by-play man Don Criqui.\n\n\"I remember it happening,\" Mara said. \"I remember thinking we had the game won. It should come as no surprise to you, I remember slamming my fist down on the table and, back then, they had the actual microphones on the table instead of the headsets they wear now, and I think the microphones ended up falling all over the place.\"\n\nMara never worked another game, assuming that CBS didn't want him back.\n\n\"That's probably the last place I should be, in a broadcast booth during a game,\" Mara said, laughing. \"It was a pretty miserable feeling for quite some time.\"\n\nIt only got worse the next day, sitting in the library at law school.\n\n\"I felt like the world had just ended, and I had a professor at the time, he was my evidence professor. He was a wise guy and walked in the library and looked at me. He was about 20 feet away, and he pointed at me and just started laughing. I wanted to kill him. If I didn't have one of my closest friends trying to calm me down, I might have. It was the wrong moment on the wrong day.\"\n\nFour decades later, Edwards says he was just in the right place at the right time with the Eagles in an all-out blitz.\n\n\"For me personally, you're always going to be subject of that play,\" said Edwards, who now coaches Arizona State. \"There's kind of an irony to it all because all of a sudden, you play in the league for as long as I played, never missed a down, never missed a start, and that's kind of the play that defines my career. Then again I look at it, too, it was a good play and not a play that's not so good. In my position, you could be on the bad end of some of those plays, you know?\"\n\nEdwards, who was beaten on one of Pisarcik's two touchdown passes earlier in the game, still hears stories about the game.\n\n\"One guy told me, 'My dad was watching it when he saw it, he threw his television and broke the television.' You get all kinds of stories like that,\" he said.\n\nGiants fans have tons of stories, too.\n\nTerry Reddington, of Ridgefield, Connecticut, didn't blink when asked the significance of Nov. 19, 1978 when asked before Sunday's game against Tampa Bay.\n\n\"Pisarcik,\" the 66-year-old accountant answered.\n\nReddington has missed only seven games since becoming a season ticket holder, and he was at that one with Kevin Kolmer, a former classmate at Villanova. They had a $20 bet on the outcome.\n\n\"I'm sitting with him and he's an Eagles fan. He hands me $20. Right! The game was over,\" Reddington said. \"All the sudden I see the thing go right in front of me. I am looking around in disbelief. I had a Styrofoam cooler. I crushed that, and now I have to give him $40. It was something else that day.\"\n\nTony Mancuso, who shares season tickets now, wasn't at that game. He was a corrections officer finishing a hospital duty shift. He was paying at toll on the Tappan Zee Bridge and listening to Jim Gordon doing the play by play on radio when the fumble happened.\n\n\"I just sat there and I got yelled at by the guy in the booth because I was just sitting there screaming at the radio,\" said Mancuso, a 68-year-old who now lives in Goshen, New York.\n\nHenry Pontilione, 87, of Rutherford, New Jersey, was on the escalator leaving the stadium when the groans started.\n\n\"We tried to get back to take a look at what happened and all I could see were the Eagles getting ready to kick the point after,\" he said. \"I would have never thought they could actually fumble the ball and lose the game. All they had to do was take a knee. It was incredible. I've been asked so many times, too many to count, if I was there for The Fumble, and I have to tell people that I was. As a lifelong Giants fan and season ticket holder, I was never more embarrassed. It was actually sad.\"\n\nAnd painful.\n\n\"It was like getting kicked in the gut,\" said Kathy Dunn of Montvale, New Jersey, who was at Sunday's game with her husband, Ken.\n\nAnthony Cardino, 72, of Hoboken, New Jersey, was getting ready to leave the stadium. Suddenly, the ball was on the ground, Edwards was sprinting toward the end zone and \"all hell broke loose.\" It turned Giants fans against the organization. Some burned their tickets. Others refused to go to games.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Pisarcik's legacy will always be that play,\" Cardino said. \"There was the ball, sitting on the ground. I still can't believe it happened.\"\n\nJim Scully of Freehold, New Jersey, wasn't at the game but he remembered it while sitting in the parking lot at MetLife Stadium on Sunday. His grandfather was hospitalized in Jersey Shore Medical Center on the day of the game. One of his nurses was Pisarcik's aunt.\n\n\"She was heartbroken,\" said Scully, a, retired member of the Monmouth County prosecutor's office. \"I remember her telling me, her dad, his grandfather, had tears in his eyes.\"\n\nThe play had its fallout, too.\n\nThe Giants fired offensive coordinator Bob Gibson the following day. He was old school and didn't believe in taking a knee. So he called a running play to Csonka. There was talk in the huddle of changing the call, but the play was run and the fumble happened.\n\nIn the aftermath, taking a knee became an accepted norm in the league.\n\nAfter the season, the Giants did not renew the contract of coach John McVay and released Andy Robustelli, the team's director of operations.\n\nWith co-owners Wellington and Tim Mara feuding, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle worked out an agreement for them to hire George Young as general manager for the 1979 season. New York won its first Super Bowl after the 1986 season.\n\n\"Some people claim it (The Fumble) was the best thing that ever happened to us,\" John Mara said. \"For those of us who were there and experienced that, it's pretty hard to accept that.\"\n\nEdwards said the win catapulted the Eagles to the playoffs and then a Super Bowl appearance in January 1981.\n\n\"We had a heck of a playoff run the next four years,\" Edwards said. \"It was the play where it looks like we're not going to win, another tough loss and ... I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time. You move on, and that season and the following seasons, we start making plays, winning close games.\"\n\nNo Fumbles required.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer John Marshall and AP freelancer Jim Hague contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He\u2019s heard how his Los Angeles Clippers increasingly are being described as a heavenly free agent landing spot next summer, ahead of destinations including the team\u2019s much-discussed neighbor with its all-world superstar.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to match the Lakers for fashionableness at the best of times, especially now that LeBron James dons purple and gold, but as of Monday the 10-5 Clippers have won six of seven under Rivers (and seven straight at home), without a single big-name superstar and by digging in on the increasingly forgotten art of defense.\n\nBelow The Rim caught up with Rivers for a splash of insight into how he is proudly bucking convention, turning Staples Center into a Clippers fortress, and cutting down some of the biggest names in the NBA.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Rivers said early last week, leaning back in a functional office chair at the team\u2019s training facility near LAX. \u201cI love when I read all the rumors that all these guys, one of the teams they want to play for is the Clippers. They\u2019re right. We should be. We\u2019ve got a lot of good things going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose guys\u201d are the elite members of next summer\u2019s potential free agent crop, a dazzling bunch that may feature Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard as its headline acts. Aside from the appeal of Southern California, the Clippers also shape up well as a favored destination because they have the capacity for two max salary spots, although one of those may be earned by current forward Tobias Harris.\n\nYet the biggest selling point of all may not be sunshine or celebrity, but the chance to fit into the tight-knit and confident squad Rivers has put together. The season still is early but in the space of a week, L.A. sunk the defending champion Golden State Warriors, the surging Milwaukee Bucks and the San Antonio Spurs. Any big name coming to the Clippers wouldn\u2019t be the mastermind of a rebuild, but possibly the final piece in a championship-contending puzzle.\n\n\u201cThat's what I would think if I was a free agent,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cComing to the Clippers and turning them into a team that wins a title? It hasn't been done. For a lot of these players, it is the chance to go to a franchise and \u2018be the man,\u2019 be the one that gets them to something (we\u2019ve) never done in the history of the franchise.\u201d\n\nFor now, Rivers is just trying to win games but it isn\u2019t lost on him that his squad\u2019s performances, filled with chemistry and intensity, may be having the side effect of appealing to a superstar with itchy feet.\n\nHis presence, with the cache of a title with the Boston Celtics in 2008 and a long current contract, is all part of the package and the Clippers are a team that\u2019s enjoying life.\n\nRivers is as serious as heck about the sport and the league that has consumed virtually his entire adult life, but he knows how and when to crank up the levity for positive effect. While Durant and Draymond Green seethed at each other heading into overtime against Golden State last week, the Clippers' huddle, fresh from coughing up a 14-point lead, was in fits of laughter. Rather than remonstrating, Rivers got the group giggling with a comically melodramatic speech about how he couldn\u2019t believe how bad they were playing. The response was instant, and game-clinching.\n\nHe loves his players dearly, for their pluck and poise and mix of youth and experience. He sees potential in them, and while next summer and the prospect of free agent sparkle looms, there is no sense of biding time until a star lands on the doorstep.\n\n\u201cI think the superstars have earned it,\u201d he added. \u201cI think they're that good. But just because you don't have one, doesn't mean you should go put your head in the sand. If you have one then great, that makes you a better team, too. But if you don't and you have a bunch of really good players like us, you should be pretty good too.\u201d\n\nRivers has been through a lot and thinks a lot. Toward the end of his playing career his house in San Antonio was burned down by racist extremists in a sickening sign of opposition to his interracial marriage. He\u2019ll talk basketball and politics and pretty much anything else, and he is mightily impressed by the social awareness and consciousness of the current group of NBA players.\n\nAt 57, he likes seeing youngsters come through and he has one of genuine promise at his disposal, rookie guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Alongside the hard-working Canadian there is plenty to like on the Clippers team, with Lou Williams\u2019 shining creativity and Danilo Gallinari marshaling a core of worthy competitors. With the Blake Griffin-Chris Paul-Deandre Jordan era still a recent memory, the Clippers have found a new identity that sits neatly with their fan base.\n\n\u201cI love the identity,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe keep talking about this blacktop philosophy because that's who we are. We're a chain gang group of guys. We're physical, we play hard, we're competitive, but we're real to each other.\n\n\u201cOur fans are a blue collar crowd. A lot of them came because they love basketball and the Clippers ticket was easier to get, and they became Clippers fans. And that's a great fan, because they have a loyalty to the game and to the team.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, the Clippers have resisted the temptation to focus solely on the shooting arms race engulfing the NBA and also are tackling the complicated and unfashionable task of how to shut down the opposition.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to play defense these days,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that luxury.\u201d\n\nAnd so the Clippers don\u2019t take possessions off and Rivers doesn\u2019t take days off. He still loves this as much as ever and just as one phase of team history evaporated another has arrived that has a chance to be even better. The future in this part of the Los Angeles basketball sphere appears to get brighter and brighter, but for now, the present is pretty darn good too.\n\nFollow Rogers on Twitter @RogersJourno"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Touchdown Wire", "title": "Tom Brady thinks Michigan will kick Ohio State's butt", "description": "Tom Brady played his college football at Michigan.

USA TODAY\n\nPG&E filed a report with the California Public Utilities Commission noting a second outage on one of its distribution lines in the area of the deadly Camp Fire in northern California. (Photo: Gilitukha / Getty Images)\n\nThe wildfire that essentially destroyed the Northern California city of Paradise continued to burn Monday while search teams sifted through the ashes looking for more victims.\n\nA total of 699 people, down from nearly 1,000 this weekend, were listed as missing Monday night, and Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea has urged area residents to see whether they or their friends or family members are on the list. Honea hopes the list will shrink quickly as residents check in to say they are safe.\n\nHonea also said the death toll may never be known.\n\nHere are five important things to know about the Camp Fire.\n\nIt started as a brush fire\n\nThe Camp Fire ignited Nov. 8 in the brush of a rugged canyon in the parched foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. At first inaccessible, the small blaze near unpaved Camp Fire Road in Butte County was whipped by wind gusts and quickly became an inferno. It raced through the tinder-dry brush undeterred as it rolled into Paradise, population 27,000, and nearby communities. At its peak the inferno swallowed up the equivalent of 60 football fields per minute.\n\nUtility scrutinized as cause is probed\n\nCal Fire lists the cause as under investigation. A Pacific Gas & Electric high-voltage power line has come under scrutiny, however, because it malfunctioned about 15 minutes before the fire was first spotted nearby. The company said it filed an \"initial electric incident report\" with state regulators, adding that \"there has been no determination on the cause of the Camp Fire.\"\n\nDeath, destruction tolls keep rising\n\nAuthorities have confirmed 79 deaths and are continuing to sift through the ashes of burned-out homes and businesses for more remains. As of 7 p.m. Monday, Cal Fire reported that 11,713 residences, 472 businesses and 3,388 barns, sheds and other buildings have burned in the blaze. Search teams \"will use their specialized human and canine skills to assist the Butte County Sheriff in the search for missing victims,\" Cal Fire said.\n\nThe fire isn't out yet\n\nThe fire was 70 percent contained on Monday night, Cal Fire said. As a result, almost 14,500 more homes, businesses and other buildings remained threatened. Almost 400 fire trucks, 17 helicopters and more than 4,700 firefighters were battling the blaze. The good news and bad news was that rain was forecast for Wednesday through Friday. \"The rain is definitely going to have a positive effect on fire suppression activity,\" Forest Service spokesman Brian Ramsey said. But the totals, 2-4 inches, could be too much of a good thing \u2013 ash flows, mudslides and flooding could result.\n\nResettlement could take years\n\nHundreds of residents left homeless are living in tent cities. Others have found temporary shelter with friends or relatives. But resettling everyone could take years. Ed Mayer, executive director of the Butte County Housing Authority, said the percentage of rentals available before the Camp Fire was a meager 2 percent or less. The fire has turned the housing problem into a crisis, he said. \u201cWe have a long resettlement effort on our hands,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have these folks living in tents in the Walmart parking lot for the next five to seven years.\"\n\nContributing: Damon Arthur, Redding (Calif.)

(AP Photo/Wade Payne) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee is trying to manage an uncertain quarterback situation as it prepares to visit Vanderbilt this week with a bowl bid at stake.\n\nAn injury prevented Jarrett Guarantano from playing the final three quarters of a 50-17 loss to Missouri last week. An injury also knocked wide receiver Marquez Callaway out of the Missouri game early.\n\n\"As far as Jarrett, he'll be day to day this week, and probably the same thing with Callaway,\" Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said Monday.\n\nPruitt said Callaway has a bruised chest. Pruitt hasn't specified the nature of Guarantano's issue, but it was described on the television broadcast as a head/neck injury.\n\nOn the first series of the game, Missouri's Tyree Gillespie came from the blind side to sack Guarantano and appeared to hit the quarterback around the back of the neck while bringing him down. Television cameras showed Guarantano with his head in his hands as he sat on the sideline.\n\nHe remained in the game for the next two series before leaving for good. Guarantano was sacked on each of Tennessee's first two possessions.\n\nGuarantano has been sacked 21 times this year and is working behind a line that lost preseason all-SEC tackle Trey Smith to blood clots in his lungs and Alabama graduate transfer Brandon Kennedy to a knee injury. Guarantano's tendency to hold on to the ball too long occasionally makes him prone to sacks as well.\n\nStanford graduate transfer Keller Chryst took over for Guarantano and played well early before struggling the rest of the way. Chryst completed four of his first five passes for 108 yards but went 3 of 15 for 65 yards with two interceptions the rest of the way.\n\n\"Keller is a hard worker,\" Pruitt said after the game. \"He's been great for our program. Our kids love him. He's a good leader, and he's got some experience. I know there are a few throws he'd like to have back, but he did a good job moving the ball. He's got toughness, but there were a couple plays there where we turned the ball over that probably hurt us a little more. And if it wasn't for those plays, he probably did a good job.\"\n\nGuarantano has gone 140 of 217 through the air for 1,768 yards with 11 touchdown passes and two interceptions. Chryst is 23 of 47 for 450 yards with three touchdown passes and two interceptions.\n\n\"From an offensive line perspective, we'll just have to protect both of them,\" offensive tackle Marcus Tatum said. \"Regardless of who's in there, we have to protect either one.\"\n\nWhichever quarterback plays Saturday will have a much better chance of success if Callaway is available.\n\nCallaway caught two passes for 98 yards against Missouri before his early exit. He has 34 catches for 556 yards this season to lead Tennessee in both categories.\n\n\"I think he's going to be in a black jersey, no contact for a couple of days,\" Pruitt said Monday. \"He had a bruise to his chest area. He's a tough guy. I'm sure he'll be out there ready to go.\"\n\nTennessee (5-6, 2-5 SEC) and Vanderbilt (5-6, 2-5) both must win Saturday to secure bowl eligibility. Tennessee also is trying to end a two-game losing streak in a rivalry it has traditionally dominated.\n\nVanderbilt's 45-34 victory over Tennessee in 2016 likely cost the Vols a Sugar Bowl berth. The Commodores' 42-24 triumph at Neyland Stadium last year caused Tennessee to set a school record for losses and capped a season in which the Vols went winless in SEC play. Tennessee is 2-4 against Vanderbilt over the last six years after going 28-1 in this series from 1983-2011.\n\n\"When I was a freshman, they were dancing on the field (afterward),\" Tatum said. \"It was pretty embarrassing.

The Indians will continue to sell \"Wahoo\" merchandise at their team shop.\n\nCleveland's caps as well as its home and road jerseys will feature the guitar-shaped 2019 All-Star Game logo.

Sanchez knows offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh from their time together with the New York Jets, where now quarterbacks coach Kevin O'Connell was his backup.\n\nGruden said Monday that Sanchez was the pick to sign over Kellen Clemens, Josh Johnson, T.J. Yates and EJ Manuel because of his experience and success in the NFL. All five worked out at the team's facility Monday.\n\nSmith underwent surgery Sunday night to repair a broken right tibia and fibula. Gruden says surgery went well, he didn't believe there was any ligament damage and hopes Smith can make a full recovery in six to eight months.\n\n___\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nThe Washington Redskins will turn to Colt McCoy as their starting quarterback and brought in veterans Mark Sanchez, Kellen Clemens, T.J. Yates, EJ Manuel and Josh Johnson as potential backup candidates after Alex Smith's season-ending injury.\n\nMcCoy is in line to start Thursday at the Dallas Cowboys. The team is expected to sign one of the five quarterbacks brought in to take Smith's spot on the roster.\n\nSmith broke his right fibula and tibia on a sack in a two-point loss to Houston on Sunday. Facing a short week before the Thanksgiving Day game against the NFC East-rival Cowboys, the priority is on someone who can quickly learn the offense.\n\nSanchez and Clemens know offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh from their time with the New York Jets. Johnson played for Cincinnati in 2013 when coach Jay Gruden was the Bengals' offensive coordinator.\n\nMcCoy threw for a touchdown Sunday in his first pass in a regular-season game since 2015. His last start came in 2014, the same season he beat Dallas on the road on Monday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: John Gutierrez, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nA beloved Texas fan favorite will be missing Friday when the No. 11 Longhorns play on the road at Kansas with a chance to earn a spot in the Big 12 championship game.\n\nThe Longhorns\u2019 three-year-old steer Bevo XV cannot attend the game because of the Kansas rule prohibiting live mascots in the stadium. This will only be the second time in the past 73 years that the school\u2019s steer couldn\u2019t take the field at the Thanksgiving week game.\n\nThe Texas steer mascot tradition started in 1916 when one was brought to a Thanksgiving Day game. Ben Dyer, the campus magazine editor, gave him the name Bevo. Although no one knows for sure exactly why the first one was named Bevo, it is believed he was named either for a non-alcoholic beverage by the same name or because the plural of beef is beeves.\n\nThe current mascot\u2019s real name was Sunrise Spur, but all mascots are renamed Bevo. There\u2019s no official weight listed for Bevo XV, but his predecessor Bevo XIV weighed 1,800 pounds.\n\nThese steers have plenty of history: Bevo III escaped and was at large on campus for two days, Bevo XIII is considered the winningest mascot because he was present for four championships (1990, 1994, 1995 in the Southwestern Conference and 1996 in the Big 12) and Bevo XIV attended George W. Bush\u2019s second inauguration in 2005.\n\nNo word on where Bevo XV will be during the game, but he eats 30 pounds of food per day. So we can be guessing he will be snacking during the game."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Cat Hofacker, USA TODAY", "title": "Post-Michelle Wolf, biographer Chernow to headline White House Correspondents Dinner", "description": "'Hamilton' biographer to host 2019 WHCD", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/11/19/biographer-ron-chernow-white-house-correspondents-association/2054295002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.kens5.com/assets/GANNETT/images/7878cdf1-2784-4294-b43b-85e73dc7f7df/7878cdf1-2784-4294-b43b-85e73dc7f7df_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:37:02Z", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Months after comedian Michelle Wolf made controversial remarks at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, the group announced Monday that biographer Ron Chernow will headline the the organization's 2019 dinner.

But this year's guest Wolf drew controversy with her remarks, which included jabs at Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\n\"I actually really like Sarah. I think she\u2019s very resourceful,\" Wolf said at the dinner. \"She burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Maybe she\u2019s born with it, maybe it\u2019s lies. It\u2019s probably lies.\"\n\nMore: The Bubble: Liberals and conservatives debate whether Michelle Wolf went too far\n\nMore: Michelle Wolf 'wouldn't change a single word' she said at White House Correspondents Dinner\n\nWolf's routine was criticized by many, including members of the press. Former WHCA President Margaret Talev later released a statement that Wolf's comments did not uphold the organization's mission to offer a \"unifying message about our common commitment to a vigorous and free press.\"\n\n\"Every day we are working hard to advocate for our members and ensure coverage that benefits the public, and the dinner is an important opportunity to highlight and maintain our essential work,\" the statement read.\n\nAfter WHCA's announcement on Monday, Wolf called the group \"cowards.\"\n\n\"The @whca are cowards. The media is complicit. And I couldn't be prouder,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe last time the dinner featured a non-comedian was in 2003, when singer Ray Charles provided entertainment.\n\nFor his part, Chernow promised that he wouldn't \"be dry.\"\n\n\"My major worry these days is that we Americans will forget who we are as a people and historians should serve as our chief custodians in preserving that rich storehouse of memory,\" Chernow said. \"While I have never been mistaken for a stand-up comedian, I promise that my history lesson won\u2019t be dry.\u201d\n\nKnox noted Chernow brings a \"deeply researched\" perspective on American politics. Chernow has chronicled the lives of many American businessmen, Founding Fathers and past presidents.\n\nHis most recent biography of President Ulysses Grant was named one of the 10 best books of the year by the New York Times.\n\nThe recipient of awards like the Pulitzer Prize for Biography and the National Medal for Humanities, Chernow said his speech at the WHCA dinner is a \"perfect moment to go back to basics\" on the First Amendment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has yet to attend the dinner, a notable departure from the conduct of past presidents. Trump has repeatedly called for the WCHA dinner to end, calling it a \"disaster and an embarrassment.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/11/19/biographer-ron-chernow-white-house-correspondents-association/2054295002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jayme Deerwester, USA TODAY", "title": "Prince Louis cuddles with Prince Charles,' steals the scene in royal family photo outtake", "description": "During the portrait shoot commemorating Prince Charles' 70th birthday, Prince Louis could not get enough of his grandpa.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/19/prince-louis-prince-charles-royal-family-photo-outtake/2053195002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b52518a68c1582c1e60cfcfba7310ea188da61e5/c=0-397-1675-1344/local/-/media/2018/11/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636777254775885111-DIC06.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:36:10Z", "content": "Prince Charles is heir to the throne and so an ordinary gift would not do for his grandson, Prince George.

In the second, the future king laughs as he holds the fifth in line to the throne.\n\nWe\u2019re particularly fond of the third one, which you see by clicking clicking the right arrow. In it, the littlest royal can be seen reaching forward to put his hand on his grandfather's face. Charles apparently found the baby's antics hilarious, as did Kate, William, Harry and Meghan.\n\nThree-year-old Charlotte, who is usually the Cambridge kid you can count on for photographic gold, was actually all business, staring off into the distance.

It will be the Filipino's 70th fight in a career that began in 1995 and has included titles in weight classes from flyweight to welterweight. He hasn't fought in the United States in two years.\n\nReferred to by his followers as Senator Manny, Pacquiao won and then lost the WBO welterweight crown following his lopsided loss to Floyd Mayweather in a May 2015 megafight. In July, he knocked out Lucas Matthysse for the WBA title, Pacquiao's first KO victory since 2009 when he stopped Miguel Cotto in the final round.\n\nHis government role will be placed aside, Pacquiao claims, while he prepares for Broner.\n\n\"My opponent is fast, good, and I have to work hard and train hard so the people will be happy on Jan. 19 when we give them a good fight,\" said Pacquiao, who flashed a mischievous smile when asked if another encounter with the currently retired Mayweather might be in the future.\n\n\"I am fighting Adrien Broner,\" Pacquiao said, adding he was with Mayweather in Japan and mentioned that he, not Mayweather, owned a belt, so \"you come challenge me.\"\n\nBroner views this as his chance to \"become a legend.\" As he strutted around the stage, his words at first were respectful toward Pacquiao, whom Broner \"dreamed of fighting when I was a kid.\"\n\nSoon, though, Broner was back to being Broner, the boastful, say-anything-character who likes talking trash as much as throwing leather.\n\n\"He ain't fighting Floyd, he's fighting me,\" Broner said. \"He's gotta get past me first.\n\n\"Of course, things he's done in the game are unbelievable. I know Jan. 19 I gotta be at the top of my game. I'm gonna (mess) him up.\"\n\nBroner, from Cincinnati, is 33-3-1 with 24 knockouts. But he didn't win either of his most recent fights, losing a unanimous decision to Mikey Garcia, who won his 36th straight, in July last year, and then drawing with Jessie Vargas.\n\nWhich means recent results indicate neither he nor Pacquiao is in his prime or close to it. Still, they are big enough names for Showtime to put the fight on pay-per-view television.\n\nBoth men were asked if they are elite boxers now. Neither flinched in answering.\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" Pacquiao insisted. \"I want to fight the greatest opponents in the world and one of them is Adrien Broner. I can fight anybody.\"\n\nBroner shook his head and smirked when queried on his skill level these days.\n\n\"I'm gonna do me; he's gotta worry about what I do,\" Broner said. \"I know what he can do.\n\n\"I got three losses, he's got (seven). He's been knocked out; we know he can go to sleep. I got the stuff to do it. I'll hit the jackpot overnight.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Gurley is a solid bet to pace the league in yards from scrimmage and touchdowns for the second straight year.\n\n\"I think whomever has the bigger game here will be talked about even more as the MVP front-runner. I don't know if it will decide it, but it makes it interesting as hell. It's great that these two guys get to square off, so to speak. This is exactly what the league wants,\" said Riddick.\n\n\"They want new superstars to be hyped up legitimately. ... Todd Gurley is a legit player, and he would be in any era. Patrick Mahomes is a legit player, and he would be in any era. This game deserves all the attention that obviously it's getting.\"\n\nMore: 'The only way sometimes is over the top': Inside NFL players' art of hurdling defenders\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 11 of the 2018 NFL season\n\nMore: NFL Week 11 winners, losers: Cowboys save their season, Jaguars are major disappointment\n\nReid vs. McVay\n\nWith another nod to the Saints and Sean Payton, it doesn't get much better than the Chiefs' Andy Reid and Rams' Sean McVay when it comes to innovative, forward-thinking coaches who are letting their space-age offenses evolve.\n\nAnd though that's a familiar narrative as it pertains to McVay, 32, now in his second year at the helm, perhaps Reid doesn't get his just due for his ability to adapt in this, his 20th season as an NFL head coach.\n\n\"Andy Reid, who's more respected than him?\" said Riddick, who worked for him in Philadelphia. \"Sean McVay \u2014 he's like a new face of the league.\n\n\"It's like the younger version of the older guy going against each other. And it's funny, it's only in name that Andy is older. Because in terms of football intellect and innovations and willingness to adapt and change and stay on the cutting edge \u2014 he's right there.\n\n\"Look at what he's done to his offense \u2014 this offense looks nothing like it use do in Philadelphia. Although it still has West Coast principles, it's about as radical as it gets now. No one would have ever thought Andy would do that. He's done it \u2014 and it's working.\"\n\nKansas City owns the No. 4 offense (423.1 yards per game) but is second in points with 35.3 per game. Los Angeles ranks second in total offense (448 ypg) and third in scoring (33.5 ppg).\n\nChange of venue\n\nThis game was supposed to be played in Mexico City as part of the league's International Series. But sub-standard playing conditions at Estadio Azteca caused the NFL to shift this showcase to the L.A. Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe Rams spent last week training in Colorado Springs, a getaway originally planned to acclimate them to Mexico City's altitude.\n\n\"The Chiefs really couldn't care less where they play it,\" opined Riddick. \"It's probably less hassle, if you're a player, if you're in your home country and your more familiar surroundings. Andy Reid has a house in Los Angeles. It's no big deal to them. They want to be on a fast track where there are no excuses for them or their opponent.\n\n\"I think both teams, quite honestly, are probably relieved that it's going to be here and no distractions or issues to worry about.\"\n\nWhither Marcus Peters?\n\nThe volatile former all-pro \u2014 the Rams acquired the defensive back from the Chiefs in the offseason \u2014 is having a rough year, consistently burned for big plays. His propensity to gamble hasn't meshed well with coordinator Wade Phillips' scheme, where lockdown ability is more valued \u2014 especially with top corner Aqib Talib on the shelf for a few more weeks.\n\nShould we expect Peters to frequently find himself in Mahomes' crosshairs?\n\n\"Who knows Marcus Peters better than Andy Reid? Why do you think they traded him? If they thought he was that valuable, he'd still be on their football team. So, if I'm Wade Phillips right now, I'm worried about how my defense is trending overall,\" said Riddick.\n\n\"They could get the doors blown off by this offense the same way they did against the Saints, and that's just not acceptable.\"\n\nSo what about the defenses?\n\nKansas City's overall numbers are worse, though the Chiefs have arguably played better lately than the Rams, who have allowed 103 points over the past three games and were gashed for 273 rushing yards by Seattle in Week 10.\n\n\"Both of these teams have three guys who can really rush the passer,\" said Riddick, referencing the Rams' Aaron Donald, Ndamukong Suh and Dante Fowler and the Chiefs' Justin Houston, Dee Ford and Chris Jones.\n\n\"All it really takes is one play at an opportune time \u2014 strip sack, fumble recovery deep in the opponent's territory.\"\n\nBut Riddick agreed L.A. may be more suspect at the moment, especially given the weapons Mahomes has downfield in speed receiver Tyreek Hill and tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nRunning back Kareem Hunt, who eclipsed Gurley for the rushing title in 2017, may even loom as the guy to watch.\n\n\"Number one, run defense is about attitude. Two, then it's about gap control and doing it over and over,\" said Riddick, adding L.A. is \"very, very suspect\" beyond the line.\n\n\"The Rams jump out in front of people so much, that what winds up happening is \u2014 I think these guys are in such pass-rush mode, that when it comes to actually playing against a team that's going to punch you in the mouth, they're just not used to it.\n\n\"Both these teams are a little bit victims of their circumstances as far as how good their offenses are and how people try to attack them. And they may be a little personnel deficient.\"\n\nWho wins?\n\nI picked K.C. 37-33, and three of my four colleagues on USA TODAY Sports' NFL picks panel agreed.\n\nYou'll have to tune in for Riddick's choice.\n\n\"Obviously, it starts with the quarterbacks and which of these young guys can maintain their composure and stay within the context of their overall schematic plan and execute without making too many mistakes \u2014 because, in this game, I think every possession is going to be key. They're going to need to keep pace with one another,\" he said.\n\n\"I really do think this is going to be a situation where the last team that has the ball wins.\"\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Maui Invitational underway; No. 8 Auburn playing Xavier", "description": "No. 8 Auburn facing Xavier to kick off loaded Maui Invitational field", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/19/maui-invitational-underway-no-8-auburn-playing-xavier/38565825/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:13:27Z", "content": "LAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) The Maui Invitational is underway with one of the most stacked fields in tournament history.

I thought these guys both did that, they both competed and the difference obviously was their outstanding play.\"\n\nThe Tigers (4-0) shot poorly from the perimeter early \u2014 3 for 15 from 3-point range and had a hard time shaking the new-look Musketeers (2-2). The Tigers missed missing badly on a shot to win it in regulation, but outscored Xavier 11-2 in overtime.\n\nAuburn scored 31 points off Xavier's 22 turnovers overall to earn a spot in the semifinals against Duke.\n\nRyan Welage had 17 points and Paul Scruggs 16 for the Musketeers.\n\n___\n\nARIZONA 71, IOWA STATE 66\n\nArizona needed 30 minutes to get going. Once the Wildcats did, short-handed Iowa State had no real answer.\n\nJustin Coleman scored 18 points and Arizona rallied from a 10-point second-half deficit to knock off the Cyclones 71-66.\n\nArizona (4-0), with its overhauled roster, was ragged well into the second half before playing better at both ends during a 12-2 run that tied it at 56-all with five minutes left. The Wildcats went ahead and stayed there, making eight straight free throws in the final 39 seconds to earn a spot in Tuesday's semifinals against No. 3 Gonzaga or Illinois.\n\n\"We didn't panic, we hung in there,\" Arizona coach Sean Miller said.\n\nThe scrappy Cyclones (3-1) played without point guard Lindell Wigginton and forward Solomon Young due to injuries, and Cam Lard and Zoran Talley because of suspensions.\n\nThat left eight scholarship players for the Maui opener against Arizona, but it didn't slow them early. The Cyclones led by seven at halftime and stretched it to 10 midway through the second half before Arizona rallied.\n\nMarial Shayok led Iowa State with 19 points.\n\n___\n\nNO. 3 GONZAGA 84, ILLINOIS 78\n\nGonzaga knew it would have a tough time against Illinois' frenetic style of play.\n\nIt took the Zags some time to figure it out and they still needed some big plays down the stretch, but now they're off to the Maui Invitational semifinals.\n\nRui Hachimura scored 23 points, Zach Norvell Jr. added 15 and No. 3 Gonzaga held off Illinois 84-78 to earn a semifinal showdown with Arizona.\n\nGonzaga (4-0) overcame 22 turnovers by shooting 52 percent.\n\n\"They're a team that brings a lot of adversity,\" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. \"When you are strong with it (the ball) and shoot a high percent, that's what ends up giving it to you.\"\n\nGonzaga went up 13 in the second half and withstood Illinois' 10-0 run to lead nine with 97 seconds left.\n\nThe Illini weren't done, though.\n\nAlan Griffin hit a 3-pointer and Trent Frazier scored on a four-point play to pull the Illini within 80-78.\n\nIllinois forced Gonzaga into a difficult shot and got the ball back with 30 seconds left, but Frazier air-balled a long 3-pointer.\n\nGonzaga's Jeremy Jones hit two free throws to send the Zags into Tuesday's semifinals.\n\nFrazier scored 27 of his 29 points in the second half and Giorgi Bezhanishvili added 17 for Illinois.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Xbox One X\u2014$399 (Save $100): The more powerful Xbox One X is at a great price right now, and it offers a full 4K gaming experience and can play 4K Blu-rays.

Class FHD 1080p Smart LED TV\u2014$218 (Save $60): This TV is a great buy for the price, but we recommend using an external streaming device instead of the built-in features.

Apple iPad (2018) 32GB WiFi\u2014$309 (Save $20): We can expect the latest Apple iPad model to be at an even lower price on actual Black Friday (around $250), but if you want to beat the lines or are worried it will be out of stock, you might as well get it now with this nice discount.\n\nThere are even more deals on Black Friday, of course.

That's both good and bad news there as the rain will douse the fires but could also lead to floods.\n\nHowever, many Californians will likely trade the concern for holiday travel disruptions for the wildfire relief, AccuWeather said.\n\n\"The rain mid- to late week will greatly aid crews battling the Camp Fire,\" according to AccuWeather meteorologist Mike Doll. \"The negative is rain can be heavy enough to cause flooding, with a risk of mudslides and debris flows in the burn areas.\"\n\nThe rain will last at least through Friday in the coastal and valley areas of northern California, while snow will whiten the Sierra Nevada.\n\nRain and mountain snow will spread across California ahead of #Thanksgiving, bringing the risk of flooding and travel delays: https://t.co/QL8nAujKlbpic.twitter.com/MqhCv8tsWn \u2014 AccuWeather (@breakingweather) November 19, 2018\n\nOn the other side of the nation, the other trouble spot on Wednesday will be around the Great Lakes and in the Northeast, where some potentially heavy snow squalls could cause whiteout conditions Wednesday.\n\nCities such as Erie and State College, Pennsylvania, as well as Buffalo, Syracuse and Binghamton, New York, are all at risk for snow.\n\nNormal visibility can suddenly be replaced by wind-whipped snow and whiteouts as a heavy burst of snow moves in, making it hard to see even a few feet in front of your vehicle, AccuWeather said.\n\nSnow squalls could bring dangerous whiteouts to people traveling across the Northeast on Wednesday ahead of #Thanksgiving: https://t.co/vjWhqQAmJgpic.twitter.com/VQ4UAa4lbg \u2014 AccuWeather (@breakingweather) November 19, 2018\n\nThe rest of the nation should enjoy rather tranquil and worry-free travel weather on Wednesday.\n\nFor Thanksgiving itself, the big story won't be snow but brutal, record-smashing cold for much of the eastern U.S. The most intense chill is expected in the Northeast and New England.\n\nFor some Northeast cities, high temperatures on Thanksgiving should be the coldest in decades and possibly the coldest on record, the Weather Channel said.\n\nHow cold? High temperatures on Thanksgiving will only be in the 20s in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. \"For those doing any Thanksgiving Day Turkey Trot road races, think more like 'Reindeer Runs,' \" Weather Channel winter storm expert Tom Niziol quipped.\n\nHigh temperatures on #Thanksgiving could be among the coldest on record for the holiday in parts of the Northeast: https://t.co/XbVmilqAnvpic.twitter.com/Cj2kPdIjQV \u2014 The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) November 18, 2018\n\nThe deep freeze will chill New York City, where the biting wind in combination with the cold should make for frigid conditions at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\n\"I'd practice shivering right now!\" weather.us meteorologist Ryan Maue said.\n\nOn Black Friday, while unseasonable cold continues to chill the Northeast, showers and thunderstorms will dampen shoppers waiting outdoors in the Southeast.\n\nAccording to forecasts, some areas will see the coldest/earliest temperatures (both Highs and Lows) to start the \"winter season\" in the Northeast \"ever\"\n\n\n\nAs cold as Thanksgiving \ud83e\udd83will be -- Black Friday morning will be COLDER!\n\n\n\nSingle digits & even some below zero in mountains. pic.twitter.com/vZzmXWVDYV \u2014 Ryan Maue | weathermodels.com (@RyanMaue) November 19, 2018\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/19/thanksgiving-weather-forecast-cold-turkey-east-soggy-california/2055146002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "William & Mary hires former Virginia coach Mike London", "description": "William & Mary hires former Virginia, Howard coach Mike London to lead the Tribe", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/19/william-mary-hires-former-virginia-coach-mike-london/38565735/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:58:01Z", "content": "WILLIAMSBURG, Va.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 New Orioles general manager Mike Elias spoke excitedly Monday about rebuilding the worst team in the majors by drafting wisely, stocking the farm system and delving deep into the International market.\n\nAfter finishing 47-115 this year, the Orioles essentially will start from scratch under the 35-year-old Elias and a yet-to-be named replacement for manager Buck Showalter, who was fired after 8\u00bd seasons.\n\nSitting between John Angelos and Lou Angelos \u2014 Baltimore's top officials and sons of owner Peter Angelos \u2014 Elias warned at his introductory news conference there are no shortcuts to the reboot. But the former Houston Astros assistant GM added, \"We're going to do this as quickly as we can.\"\n\nElias wore a gray suit and an orange tie. His fashion choice was entirely appropriate because orange is the prominent color of both the Orioles and Astros, and his success in Houston is why he got the job.\n\n\"There is exciting potential here,\" Lou Angelos said. \"Mike's deep background in scouting really made quite a difference in the discussions that we had. His success with the Astros, hearing about it in detail, he's been through this.\"\n\nThe Orioles shifted into rebuild mode in July under former Dan Duquette, the executive vice president of baseball operations who traded away many of the team's stars \u2014 most notably Manny Machado, Zach Britton, Jonathan Schoop and Kevin Gausman \u2014 for 15 prospects and International bonus pool money in moves that cut payroll from $151 million to $136 million.\n\nElias figures that saved him the trouble of dealing veterans himself.\n\n\"Those were the right moves. The team had left a period of competitiveness,\" Elias said. \"It was clear it was time to bring in new, younger talent into the organization. We're going to build off of that work.\"\n\nStill, Baltimore's farm system is ranked in the bottom third by Baseball America.\n\nElias arrived in Houston in 2012, when the Astros were in the midst of three straight 100-loss seasons. They won 70 games in 2014, reached the playoffs in 2015 and won the World Series in 2017. Houston won 100 games this year for a second consecutive season before falling to Boston in the ALCS.\n\n\"We're going to do everything in our power to move things in the right direction,\" Elias said. \"We're not going to be perfect with our decision making. Nobody is. But we're going to add talent in every direction until the wins pile up.\"\n\nLou Angelos noted: \"This is a time for fans to invest along with us in the process.\"\n\nGetting a manager is one of the first steps in the plan.\n\n\"The process and the background work have already begun,\" Elias said. \"I have a lot of contacts around the game and have already started tapping into those networks. But this is an important hire, just like this was an important hire for (the Orioles), and it's not something you rush. We want to get the right person for this time.\"\n\nElias got the job by impressing the Angelos brothers with his enthusiasm, knowledge of analytics and his blueprint to get the Orioles closer toward earning their first World Series title since 1983.\n\n\"We all came into the conversations with very specific plans and ideas and visions in mind for what this should look like and how we should go about these things,\" Elias said. \"We were on exactly the same page with what the approach should be.\"\n\nIt didn't hurt that Elias was graduated from Yale, where he went 9-10 with a 5.15 ERA in 22 starts and 22 relief appearances as a pitcher from 2002-05..\n\n\"Well, he went to Yale, and my brother went to Hopkins and I went to Duke, so we had Ivy League envy,\" John Angelos said with a grin. \"Really though, Mike made a fantastic impression, not just initially but all throughout the process. He was incredibly prepared, thoughtful.\"\n\nElias grew up in Northern Virginia and spent plenty of time at Camden Yards and visiting Baltimore. Now he feels right at home as part of the team.\n\n\"I already have a lot of positive memories and positive impressions of this city,\" he said. \"I already know this city, I already love his city. I also got a chance to be at Camden Yards at a time when the stadium was filled to the brim and the city was supporting a championship caliber team. So I know there's no place better in baseball when that is the case.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Rob Schumacher, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nFifteen miles from the Las Vegas Strip, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, rivals for more than two decades, will go head-to-head Friday in a high-stakes duel in the desert.\n\nBilled as The Match, the two best players of their generation face off on an 18-hole gem with a huge pot of cash up for grabs. Woods has gotten the better of Mickelson during their storied careers but that will mean little in this one-day showdown with millions of dollars on the line.\n\nThe match begins at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nWho's playing: Tiger Woods (14 major championship titles, 80 PGA Tour victories) vs. Phil Mickelson (5 majors, 43 PGA Tour victories). Each won a tournament this year \u2014 Woods, 42, took home the championship hardware at The Tour Championship; Mickelson, 48, won the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship. Those were the first wins since 2013 for both players.\n\nWhere are they playing: Shadow Creek Golf Course, a man-made marvel in the Mojave Desert that is as challenging as it is beautiful. The course, a par-72 that can tip out at 7,560 yards, features many risk-reward holes, a stout collection of par-3s and long par-4s with doglegs.\n\nWhat's the purse: A winner-take-all $9 million. It\u2019s not the players\u2019 money. Instead, sponsors put up the cash.\n\nWhat's the format: Match play. Each hole is basically a tournament, as a player earns a point if he beats his opponent on the hole. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of play, which could be on the 10th hole if a player wins the first nine holes.\n\nWhat might we see as side bets: Woods and Mickelson will raise the stakes as they will be making plenty of wagers throughout the match, with the winnings going to charity. Among the expected bets will be long drive and closest-to-the-pin contests. The players also will likely propose money challenges on putts and up-and-downs. The bets will likely be in the range of $10,000 to $50,000 per wager.\n\nWhat other highlights will be offered: Both Woods and Mickelson will be mic\u2019d during the match. With no commercial breaks, there will be plenty of airtime to fill, and these two will certainly break out the needle. Their caddies Joe LaCava (Tiger) and Tim Mickelson (younger brother of Phil) will be mic\u2019d.\n\nWhat's special about the production: Drone coverage will create eye-popping aerial views of each shot, as well as highlight the golf course. The one-hour pregame show will feature Charles Barkley, Samuel L. Jackson and Pat Perez. Ernie Johnson of TNT\u2019s NBA coverage fame, will serve as the play-by-play announcer alongside Peter Jacobsen and Darren Clarke. Natalie Gulbis and Shane Bacon will be the reporters on the ground.\n\nHow to watch: The telecast will be available on pay per view for $19.99 and can be accessed through major cable providers including DirecTV, AT&T, U-Verse, Comcast and Verizon. Those watching in 4K need to pay $10 more. Bleacher Report\u2019s social media platforms will provide some pre-match viewing for free."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 2 Clemson seeking fifth straight win vs South Carolina", "description": "No. 2 Clemson is looking for its longest win streak over rival South Carolina in nearly 80 years", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/19/no-2-clemson-seeking-fifth-straight-win-vs-south-carolina/38565487/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4af45c9dec0ed251da200dc27ce1c3d12c51de12/c=0-315-6043-3714/local/-/media/2018/11/19/USATODAY/usatsports/9d168c8e37d54e5e813563a532746c6c.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:42:28Z", "content": "South Carolina quarterback Jake Bentley (19) celebrates a touchdown during the first half of the team's NCAA college football game against Chattanooga on Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018, in Columbia, S.C.

(AP) \u2014 Clemson center Justin Falcinelli was getting ready for college five years ago when he heard from family, friends and other schools about the Tigers' five straight losses to rival South Carolina.\n\nNow, the second-ranked Tigers (11-0) have a chance to hang their own five-game win streak on the Gamecocks (6-4), something that brings a smile to Falcinelli's face.\n\n\"It's kind of nice to flip the script,\" he said.\n\nTigers coach Dabo Swinney understands that too well.

It was frustrating to see when the Tigers were on the bad end of the rivalry. He would rather go through the disappointment, though, understanding that college football is front and center in the Palmetto State.\n\n\"Obviously, you don't like seeing those things,\" said Scott, a former Clemson player whose father, Brad, was head coach for five years at South Carolina. \"But at the end of the day, you like being able to coach at a place where football matters and you have passionate fans on both sides that bring a lot of energy.\"\n\nSwinney states simply that the rivalry game \"is a goal of its own, a season of its own.\"\n\nIt's a season the Tigers have owned the past few years. Clemson has outscored the Gamecocks 162-66 and laid one of the worst beatings on rivalry history on South Carolina, 56-7, the last time it visited Death Valley in 2016.\n\n\"We understand we need to do a better job on our side,\" Gamecocks coach Will Muschamp said.\n\nScott remembers too well getting caught up in the rivalry passions. He was a teenager when his dad was leading South Carolina from 1994-98 when he went out to get the paper and saw three Clemson Tiger paws painted on his family's driveway.\n\nScott grew up in Tallahassee, Florida where his father was a longtime assistant to Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, but had not felt the personal, one-on-one level of the rival's other side before that moment.\n\n\"At least it was water-based paint,\" Scott joked about his brother, John, having to clean it up.\n\nClemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables, who coached in bitter rivalries with Texas and Oklahoma State when he led Oklahoma's defense, believes there's true \"deep-seeded hate\" in this one.\n\nHe's witnessed young people at youth basketball and baseball games happily go up to Swinney and say things against Clemson or yell \"Roll Tide\" in a jab against the team's two College Football Playoff losses the past three years.\n\n\"If my child was disrespectful to anyone like that, we'd have some serious problems,\" Venables said. \"But I think it's allowed in this rivalry.\"\n\nScott said he hoped to have receiver Hunter Renfrow available for the game. Renfrow left last week's 35-6 win over Duke in the first half. Scott would not say Renfrow is going through the concussion protocol, but is being monitored and his availability for Saturday's game will be evaluated as the week progresses.\n\nFalcinelli, a Clemson redshirt senior, shook off most of the talk he heard downgrading the Tigers during his high school days. He just resolved himself to helping end South Carolina's winning streak when he arrived.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nAnother win in the series \u2014 which would also be Falcinelli's fifth \u2014 would be Clemson's longest streak of success since winning seven in row over the Gamecocks from 1934-40.\n\n\"It'd just be incredible if we could add that to the list of all the things we've done this season,\" Falcinelli said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Exact Sciences)\n\nOctober 2013, doctors found a 7-centimeter tumor in John MacLeod\u2019s colon \u2014 and an additional 20 tumors in his lungs and liver. He was just 45, but diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer [1]. Doctors told him the outlook wasn\u2019t positive. But MacLeod, a loving husband and father to two daughters, was ready to fight.\n\n\u201cI told my wife this isn\u2019t how this ends,\u201d MacLeod recalled.\n\nMacLeod underwent surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation to shrink his cancer to only a few small lesions. When the treatments stopped working, he and his wife searched for clinical trials.\n\nToday, MacLeod isn\u2019t yet cancer-free, but he\u2019s fighting for more than just himself. In 2016, he joined Fight Colorectal Cancer (Fight CRC) as an ambassador and for the last two years has traveled the country to support research, education, and awareness for thousands affected by the disease. MacLeod also serves as a Fight CRC board member.\n\n\u201cWhen I help other people who are newly diagnosed or raise money to fund research, I get so much more back than what I give,\u201d MacLeod explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to feel even more in the fight than just our personal fight.\u201d\n\nWith a background in sales, MacLeod was a natural fit to support Fight CRC\u2019s ambassador training and fundraising programs. He also helps people find clinical trials. But one of the most rewarding periods during his time with Fight CRC, he said, was the organization\u2019s advocacy work to encourage the American Cancer Society to revise its guidelines for colon cancer screening, lowering the age at which adults at average risk should start screening from 50 to 45. The American Cancer Society did just that, announcing the change in May 2018 [2]. MacLeod notes that this type of advocacy work is what motivates him to do his part.\n\n\u201cIt has the potential to save thousands of lives every year,\u201d MacLeod said. \u201cIf caught early, the five-year survival rate for people with stage 1 colon cancer is approximately 92 percent [3].\n\nIn February, MacLeod, an avid golfer, joined dozens of professional and amateur golfers in Tucson, Arizona, for a Pro-Am ahead of the Cologuard Classic to raise awareness for the importance of getting screened for colon cancer. MacLeod teamed up with PGA TOUR Champions professional Tom Lehman, who fought his own battle with colon cancer nearly 25 years ago.\n\n\u201c[John] is facing a tough challenge with a fierceness and determination and a grace that I think is inspiring to everybody,\u201d said Lehman, who was diagnosed with stage 1 colon cancer at 35 years old.\n\nMacLeod also attended various events during the Cologuard Classic, connecting with other advocates for early screening and discussing the importance of having options.\n\n\u201cFight CRC and the Cologuard Classic go well together. All the PGA TOUR Champions players are the right\n\ndemographic for colon cancer screening \u2013 over 50 \u2014 and are celebrity advocates that can help us get in front of more people to encourage them to get screened. It\u2019s great to see the movement grow through this access,\u201d MacLeod said, noting he looks forward to attending the Cologuard-sponsored Charles Schwab Cup Championship in mid-November.\n\nTo learn more about Fight CRC, visit fightcolorectalcancer.org.\n\n[1] When the term colon cancer is used in this article, it is intended to encompass colorectal cancer \u2014 which includes both colon and rectal cancer.\n\n[2] American Cancer Society.

The only person unimpressed with her heroics is Chi Chi herself. It\u2019s something anyone would do, she explains, shrugging off praise from her Jersey Shore pals.\n\nChi Chi\u2019s lifeguarding skills are put to use only once in Adriana Trigiani\u2019s historical novel \u201cTony\u2019s Wife\u201d (Harper, 462 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four), but the incident gives us a glimpse into the character of the twenty-something daughter of Italian immigrants. Her ability to save drowning men will serve Chi Chi well throughout her life with popular crooner and serial philanderer, Tony Arma, stage name for Saverio Armandonada.\n\nChi Chi and Saverio first cross paths in Sea Isle, New Jersey, where the Donatelli sisters are a popular local vocal trio in the big band era of the 1930s and '40s. Like Saverio, a Detroit native who\u2019s been given the boot by his father, Chi Chi longs for a career in the music business.\n\nIt won\u2019t be with her sisters, though, as they are perfectly content working factory jobs as they wait for their respective Mr. Rights to deliver traditional domestic bliss.\n\nOn a lark, the sisters collaborate with Saverio and record Chi Chi\u2019s original creation \"Mama\u2019s Rolling Pin,\" a playful ditty about a mother who uses her kitchen utensil as a weapon. From there, Chi Chi and Tony\u2019s partnership takes off, both onstage and off.\n\nAuthor Adriana Trigiani. (Photo: Tim Stephenson)\n\nAs the title suggests, Chi Chi\u2019s career is eclipsed by Tony\u2019s ambitions during their marriage, though she writes his hit songs and manages the money. Despite her move from spotlight to backstage, Chi Chi remains the central figure and moral compass for her family as it transforms through seven decades marked by war, marriage, tragedy, reconciliation and death.\n\n\u201cTony\u2019s Wife\u201d is Trigiani\u2019s 14th novel depicting the Italian-American experience. She keenly observes the dynamics of Italian families, providing rich visual detail and mouth-watering descriptions of meals, without venturing into caricatures.\n\nTrigiani\u2019s ability to draw characters with such authenticity is undoubtedly enriched by her own background in a large traditional Italian-American family. It's clear she knows and loves this world. Her affection for even the most flawed characters shines through.\n\nTrigiani\u2019s epic tale will appeal to readers who enjoy a more linear biographical story, rather than a plot-driven page-turner. It's gratifying to watch the young, talented Chi Chi evolve into a force of nature who protects her family with ferocity, even when some deserve to be kicked to the curb.

SMITH, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nU.S. stocks closed sharply lower on Wall Street, pulled down by more steep losses in big technology companies.\n\nApple, Microsoft and Facebook all came under heavy selling pressure Monday. Industrial companies also took a beating. Boeing was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average with a loss of 4.5 percent.\n\nThe losses came after the U.S. and China clashed at a Pacific Rim summit over the weekend, dashing hopes raised last week that the two economic giants were making progress on resolving their damaging trade dispute. Talks continue ahead of a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump planned for the G-20 summit later this month.\n\nThe Dow lost 396 points, or 1.6 percent, to 25,017. It was down as much as 512 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell nearly 46 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,691. The technology-packed Nasdaq composite suffered the biggest declines, falling 219 points, or 3 percent, to 7,029.\n\nRetailers and industrial stocks also fell. Apple slumped nearly 4 percent and Microsoft dropped 3.4 percent while internet retailer Amazon tumbled 5.1 percent.\n\nHigh-dividend-paying stocks like real estate companies and utilities, which investors favor when they are fearful of market turmoil, held up better than the rest of the market.\n\nShares of automaker Nissan sank after its chairman was arrested on misconduct charges.\n\nMore: Stock market: 5 ways to keep Dow losses from scaring you and messing up your financial plan\n\nMore: 401(k) account balances hit record high of $106,500; where do you stack up?\n\nMore: Stock market: Should investors fear a correction, or 10 percent drop?\n\nTECH LOSSES MOUNT\n\nApple gave up 3.96 percent to $185.86 and Facebook sank 5.7 percent to $131.55. Microsoft lost 3.4 percent to $104.62. Chipmaker Nvidia dropped another 12 percent to $144.70 after it said last week that it had a large number of unsold chips because of a big drop in mining of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBREAKDOWN AT NISSAN\n\nNissan said its chairman, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested Monday and will be dismissed from the company after allegedly under-reporting his income. Nissan said an internal investigation found Ghosn under-reported his income by millions of dollars and engaged in other \u201csignificant misconduct.\u201d\n\nU.S.-traded shares of Nissan lost 5.5 percent to $16.96. In Paris, shares of Nissan\u2019s partner Renault dropped 8.4 percent.\n\nSHARP LOSSES\n\nAmazon shed 5.1 percent to $1,512.29 and Nike slid 3 percent to $72.52.

U.S. crude prices have dropped for six weeks in a row and are trading around their lowest level in about nine months.\n\nThe parent company of California utility Pacific Gas & Electric fell again after it disclosed that it had a power line failure near the start of a deadly wildfire the morning the fire began. The Mercury News of San Jose reported Saturday that the company said in a filing that it had an outage at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 8 in Concow. Authorities say 76 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire. The stock has lost half its value since Nov. 8 in spite of a big rally on Friday.\n\nBond prices rose.

Rocky Balboa is back for another round this week with Creed II dropping in theaters. In honor of another Italian Stallion installment, we\u2019re celebrating Rocky Week here at For The Win, a look back at the iconic boxing film series that\u2019s made us fans for over four decades.\n\nThe end of the original Rocky is certain: Although Balboa goes the distance against Apollo Creed, a judges\u2019 split decision gives the champion a win over the feisty Philadelphia fighter.\n\nBut if you watch the fight itself, you wonder: Did Creed really deserve the victory? We decided to get a definitive answer from Steve Weisfeld, who has judged \u2014 by his count \u2014 95 world championship fights and approximately 1,900 professional bouts altogether.\n\nWeisfeld is quick to point out the judging system used in the film was based on who won each round. Now, fights are judged using the 10-point \u201cmust\u201d system, in which boxers are scored up to 10 points. The loser of a round gets 9 points or fewer, and if there\u2019s a knockdown, the fighter who hits the canvas usually loses a point.\n\nWe decided Weisfeld would use modern scoring in this case. Here\u2019s how he broke down each round (which you can watch below):\n\nRound 1\n\n\u201cRocky scores a knockdown, so a round like that is usually scored 10-8,\u201d Weisfeld says. \u201cAside from the knockdown, Creed clearly won the round, so you could also make an argument that\u2019s 10-9 for Balboa.\u201d After watching the round a second time, Weisfeld calls it 10-9 given how badly Creed hurts Rocky.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s a win for Balboa.\n\nRound 2\n\nOur judge declares it\u2019s 10-9 for Balboa. Creed lands a few hard rights for an early lead before Rocky comes back.\n\nRound 7\n\nSadly, we don\u2019t get to see the full fight. The movie skips to the seventh, where Creed lands everything and Balboa doesn\u2019t get anything in, so our judge declares Creed wins 10-9.\n\nRound 8\n\nMore quick footage of Creed dominating, so that\u2019s a 10-9 win for him.\n\nRound 13\n\nAnother jump ahead. Creed wins again, 10-9 as Balboa takes a lot of punishment.\n\nRound 14\n\nBecause Creed knocks Balboa down here, it\u2019s a 10-8 round for the champ.\n\nRound 15\n\n\u201cRocky won that round clearly,\u201d Weisfeld says. \u201cThe question is: Did he win it clearly enough that it should be 10-8 without the knockdown?\u201d He didn\u2019t see enough to give Balboa a 10-8, so it goes in the book as a 10-9.\n\nCreed definitely won 7, 8, 13 and 14. Using the old round system, Weisfeld points out, he won four of seven rounds shown. The point system also gives Creed a victory by a point, making it a close fight, but a win nonetheless.\n\n\u201cI thought from what they showed, a split decision wasn\u2019t out of the question,\u201d he says.\n\nThere you have it."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "NFL Whip Around Week 11: Lamar Jackson's debut was fun but not sustainable", "description": "SportsPulse: Lamar Jackson run all over the Bengals in his first career start and the Cowboys are now in the driver's seat to take the East.

But in a news release last Tuesday, the league said it determined that the recently re-sodded field at Mexico City's historic stadium \"does not meet NFL standards for playability and consistency, and will not meet those standards by next Monday.\"\n\nThe league consulted with the players' association and local officials before deciding it couldn't risk the players' health on a damaged field.\n\nMark Waller, the NFL's executive vice president of international, traveled to Mexico City last week following the move of the game to Los Angeles.\n\nAzteca officials changed the playing surface from natural grass to a hybrid in May, but the turf hasn't been ideal for several months. Heavy use for soccer and concerts did serious damage to the grass.\n\nAzteca hosted the first regular-season game ever held outside the U.S. in 2005 when Arizona beat San Francisco. The stadium has hosted several NFL exhibitions, and the Oakland Raiders, Houston Texans and New England Patriots all played regular-season games there over the past two years.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

William McRaven over McRaven's comments about Trump's rhetoric on the news media. Trump then took to Twitter to criticize Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has criticized Trump's appointment of Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.\n\nTrump had a weekend of insults\n\nBy EJ Montini\n\nPresident Donald Trump took the opportunity on Sunday to insult the Navy SEAL commander who oversaw the deadly assault on Osama bin Laden, along with the likely new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and, sadly, the Constitution.\n\nDuring a TV interview, Trump attacked retired Adm. William McRaven \u2014 a man battling cancer \u2014 because McRaven has been critical of some of the things Trump has said, like calling journalists \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\nAlso, after Trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, McRaven wrote an essay calling Brennan \"one of the finest public servants\" he had ever known and telling Trump that he \"would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency.\"\n\nTalker: Want more federal judges? Protect Robert Mueller\n\nSign up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nMistakenly, believing that he was criticizing McRaven, Trump said, \"Would it have been nicer if we got Osama Bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn't it been nice? Living \u2014 think of this, living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan and what I guess in what they considered a nice mansion, I don't know, I've seen nicer. But living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\"\n\nYou'd think the president would know about the investigative process that led to finding and killing bin Laden. Or at the very least that he had watched the movie \"Zero Dark Thirty.\" Apparently not.\n\nThe CIA found bin Laden. The Navy SEALs were sent in afterwards to take care of him.\n\nThat's how intelligence agencies and the military operate. It's kind of important for the president to know that.\n\nTrump also took to Twitter to insult Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.:\n\nSo funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!\n\nIn addition to the crude, lame scatological insult of Schiff, a quick peek at the Constitution (or a tutorial from a staffer) would have informed Trump that the Constitution requires a potential Cabinet member like Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to be confirmed by the Senate. It is not the same for the special counsel.\n\nI\u2019m guessing, by the way, that special counsel Robert Mueller knows a lot about the Constitution and the laws that dictate what politicians, like the president, can and cannot do.\n\nPerhaps that is why Trump seems to be extra crabby these days.\n\nEJ Montini is a columnist at The Arizona Republic, where this column first appeared.

So sad for America.\n\n\u2014 Marie Bernadette\n\nTrump will claim he was just kidding or it was a typo or was distracted or whatever.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., you will likely chair a powerful committee. You don't have to go after him on \"trumped up\" charges; there is plenty of material right in the open. Crush him.\n\n\u2014 Chas Hue Won\n\nWilliam McRaven is a hero, a stellar man, but he is not the president. McRaven seems like a cheerleader for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and he got called out on it. It's that simple. McRaven is not beyond reproach.\n\n\u2014 David Black\n\nI'm losing track of all of these \"greatest threats to our democracy\" in our lifetimes. I thought it was terrorism, nuclear war, climate change, overpopulation, pollution or income inequality. Now apparently it's Trump tweeting about the news media.\n\n\u2014 Gene Seiler\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nRachel Withers, Vox: \"President Donald Trump showed Sunday where his deferential respect for military officers stops: when they criticize him. ...Trump, who says he has the utmost respect for the troops, has also recently been criticized over his failure to attend military cemeteries in Washington and France on important commemorative days, due to calls and rain, respectively.\"\n\nPeter Bergen, CNN.com: \"The Osama bin Laden raid was, of course, a success. Not only was bin Laden killed, but also thousands of important documents about al-Qaeda were recovered during the operation. As a result, it is arguably the most successful special operations mission in American history. After stepping down from leading the Special Operations Command, William McRaven became the chancellor of the University of Texas, where as an undergraduate he had majored in journalism. (He has since retired from that role.) It's an experience that seems to have shaped McRaven's continuing pushback against Trump's assaults on the press.\"\n\nJennifer Rubin, The Washington Post: \"In 2020, Democrats, a GOP primary challenger and/or an independent conservative should take on the president\u2019s disrespectful conduct and challenge his politicization of the military. The same should go for those challenging Republican incumbent lawmakers who sit idly by as Trump engages in conduct they would have deemed impeachable in the case of Barack Obama.\"\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/19/trump-hands-out-criticism-fox-news-and-twitter-talker/2054946002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Nancy Trejos, USA TODAY", "title": "First look: New balloons coming to Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade", "description": "The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade marks 92 years.

Arizona Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet holds the Flyers\u2019 all-time penalty minutes record with 1,815 and fought 171 times during his career. (AP Photo/Amy Sancetta, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHockey in the NHL is a far different game than it was 45 years ago, when the Broad Street Bullies ruled the ice with their fists.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Philadelphia Flyers had guys like Dave \"The Hammer\" Schultz, Bob \"The Hound\" Kelly and Andre \"Moose\" Dupont to not just beat opponents but beat them up, too.\n\nThe current Flyers may still carry the \"Bullies\" nickname but they are hardly bullying anyone: They are one of only two teams in the NHL that has not been assessed a fighting major a quarter of the way through the season.\n\nThe old Bullies can hardly believe it.\n\n\"They're two different animals, the way the game is today,\" Kelly said. \"With the rules today, you can't hit anybody, you can't verbally intimidate anybody, so that takes a lot out of it. You don't have to fight anybody. The biggest thing you're given is a face wash.\"\n\nIt's no secret that fighting has been weeded out of the game over the years, but nobody expected the Flyers to be on the leading edge of the anti-pugilistic trend. With tough players like Wayne Simmonds, Radko Gudas and Dale Weise, Philadelphia isn't exactly a group of shrinking violets. Even general manager Ron Hextall fought five times during his playing career and he was a goaltender.\n\nThis is the latest in a season the Flyers have ever gone without an official NHL fighting penalty, eclipsing the previous record from 1967. That was the first year of existence for the franchise and it was before the players were beaten up in a brawl against the St. Louis Blues, an incident that prompted founder Ed Snider to demand a tough-as-nails approach.\n\n\"We have a new mascot called Gritty now, and I think the Flyers' fans expect that from then players to play like Gritty because of the name he has,\" said Bullies-era defenseman Joe Watson, who believes the current team is more about finesse. \"Fighting is a form of intimidation. ... Players think twice of going in the corner with this guy or that guy because they might get a punch in the face or hit severely or so on and so forth, and it just doesn't seem to happen right now. We do have guys that can handle themselves. I don't know why it has happened this way. It's hard to believe.\"\n\nPhiladelphia has no fighting majors and a 9-9-2 record through 20 games. While the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers lead the league with seven fights apiece, the Flyers and Arizona Coyotes are the only ones stuck on zero.\n\n\"I think we're team tough,\" Weise said. \"I don't think anyone takes advantage of us. I think if the situation arose, we've got a lot of guys that can handle themselves. But I just think the way hockey is going, you can't take a stupid penalty (if you) go and get an instigator or something like that or get a roughing and put (another) team on the power play.\"\n\nPhiladelphia isn't a small team, with players averaging 6-1 and 198 pounds, but Jakub Voracek said: \"I really cannot say that we are big and tough if we don't have a fight yet.\"\n\nMaybe the answer lies in some of that size and toughness.\n\n\"When you have a Wayne Simmonds on your team, I don't think people want to fight him and it's always good to have a guy like that who can play,\" said Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet, who holds the Flyers' all-time penalty minutes record with 1,815 and 171 fights during his career. \"If there had to be a fight, he's a pretty good deterrent guy to have. I just don't think anybody wants to fight Wayne Simmonds. That's probably why there's no fights.\"\n\nSimmonds and his teammates have tried to goad opponents into fights and a handful of times have dropped their gloves only to find no willing dance partner. According to HockeyFights.com, less than 16 percent of games leaguewide this season have had a fight, down from 41 percent as recently as 2009-10.\n\nThe NHL years ago sought to curb staged fights between enforcers, and even a lot of the fighting following big hits has decreased.\n\nIn 2009-10, 171 games included more than one fight. Last season, only 41 games had more than one.\n\n\"I don't feel there's any hate in the league anymore,\" said Kelly, who dropped the gloves 97 times in the NHL. \"The rules have definitely changed the whole game, the whole approach and it's holding back a lot of the physicality that players used to play with. It's not worth the fight, and unfortunately you have to watch your teammate skate off hurt or something because somebody got cheap shot or did something and you just can't afford to want to jump in and help out.\"\n\nFlyers coach Dave Hakstol said people can debate whether the sport is better with less fighting, but most agree there is still a purpose for it. Commissioner Gary Bettman has suggested an occasional fight keeps tensions from boiling over, something Tocchet agreed with.\n\n\"The league's trying to take control of the head injuries, the hitting from behind, the cheap stuff, sticking a guy behind his knee,\" Tocchet said. \"The NHL's trying to clean that up, so you don't need that deterrent of a guy going in there and policing (the game) himself. I still think that there's still a need for fighting in certain places ... The odd time a guy needs to be reminded that he can't do the stuff he's doing on the ice if things aren't being called.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I do,\" Higdon said after briefly contemplating the question. \"That's how I feel. I believe firmly in my brothers, this team and this coaching staff.\n\n\"As a captain, I'll take that stand. Why not?\"\n\nHigdon's comments were the final of the day from Michigan on Monday, but perhaps the most indicative of the Wolverines' confidence heading into their biggest game of the year.\n\nNo. 4 Michigan can win the Big Ten East for the first time in program history and advance to the conference championship game with a win Saturday against 10th-ranked Ohio State on Saturday in Columbus.\n\nA loss would snap the Wolverines' 10-game winning streak and extend the team's Big Ten title drought, which dates back to 2004. It also would dash Michigan' hope of advancing to the College Football Playoff for the first time.\n\n\"It's a must-win,\" Higdon said. \"We've got some lofty goals we set for ourselves early on and they're a team that's standing in our way to achieve them.\n\n\"So we've got to knock them down.\"\n\nIn 1986, then a Michigan co-captain quarterback, Harbaugh guaranteed his football team would beat Ohio State and head to the Rose Bowl.\n\nHe backed it up. The Wolverines did exactly that.\n\nHarbaugh has been asked about that guarantee every year he's been back as Michigan head coach. That didn't change Monday.\n\n\"(I don't) think about that, it's been a long time since. Not much to say about that,\" Harbaugh added. \"Can't tell you what it was. Just to answer your question. I don't remember what it was that made me say that.\"\n\nHigdon's answer was based on the faith he has in his team.\n\n\"This isn't a typical regular season game,\" Higdon said. \"This is a game that tunes everything up to a different level.\""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Josh Hafner, USA TODAY", "title": "Elevator falls 84 floors in Chicago before rescue: 'I believed we were going to die'", "description": "The accident occurred in the Chicago skyscraper known as the Hancock building after at least one of the cables snapped, Chicago news outlets reported.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/19/elevator-chicagos-former-hancock-building-falls-84-floors/2056499002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/5f461ec6-b8a7-4466-9d11-2af332eb5b71-Hancock_building.jpg?crop=555,312,x1,y45&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:14:23Z", "content": "The former John Hancock Center dominates the Chicago skyline in a 2006 photo.

USA TODAY\n\nPG&E filed a report with the California Public Utilities Commission noting a second outage on one of its distribution lines in the area of the deadly Camp Fire in northern California. (Photo: Gilitukha / Getty Images)\n\nThe wildfire that essentially destroyed the Northern California city of Paradise continued to burn Monday while search teams sifted through the ashes looking for more victims.\n\nA total of 699 people, down from nearly 1,000 this weekend, were listed as missing Monday night, and Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea has urged area residents to see whether they or their friends or family members are on the list. Honea hopes the list will shrink quickly as residents check in to say they are safe.\n\nHonea also said the death toll may never be known.\n\nHere are five important things to know about the Camp Fire.\n\nIt started as a brush fire\n\nThe Camp Fire ignited Nov. 8 in the brush of a rugged canyon in the parched foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. At first inaccessible, the small blaze near unpaved Camp Fire Road in Butte County was whipped by wind gusts and quickly became an inferno. It raced through the tinder-dry brush undeterred as it rolled into Paradise, population 27,000, and nearby communities. At its peak the inferno swallowed up the equivalent of 60 football fields per minute.\n\nUtility scrutinized as cause is probed\n\nCal Fire lists the cause as under investigation. A Pacific Gas & Electric high-voltage power line has come under scrutiny, however, because it malfunctioned about 15 minutes before the fire was first spotted nearby. The company said it filed an \"initial electric incident report\" with state regulators, adding that \"there has been no determination on the cause of the Camp Fire.\"\n\nDeath, destruction tolls keep rising\n\nAuthorities have confirmed 79 deaths and are continuing to sift through the ashes of burned-out homes and businesses for more remains. As of 7 p.m. Monday, Cal Fire reported that 11,713 residences, 472 businesses and 3,388 barns, sheds and other buildings have burned in the blaze. Search teams \"will use their specialized human and canine skills to assist the Butte County Sheriff in the search for missing victims,\" Cal Fire said.\n\nThe fire isn't out yet\n\nThe fire was 70 percent contained on Monday night, Cal Fire said. As a result, almost 14,500 more homes, businesses and other buildings remained threatened. Almost 400 fire trucks, 17 helicopters and more than 4,700 firefighters were battling the blaze. The good news and bad news was that rain was forecast for Wednesday through Friday. \"The rain is definitely going to have a positive effect on fire suppression activity,\" Forest Service spokesman Brian Ramsey said. But the totals, 2-4 inches, could be too much of a good thing \u2013 ash flows, mudslides and flooding could result.\n\nResettlement could take years\n\nHundreds of residents left homeless are living in tent cities. Others have found temporary shelter with friends or relatives. But resettling everyone could take years. Ed Mayer, executive director of the Butte County Housing Authority, said the percentage of rentals available before the Camp Fire was a meager 2 percent or less. The fire has turned the housing problem into a crisis, he said. \u201cWe have a long resettlement effort on our hands,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have these folks living in tents in the Walmart parking lot for the next five to seven years.\"\n\nContributing: Damon Arthur, Redding (Calif.)

The first being cornerback Sidney Jones, who was coming off a hamstring injury. The second target for the Saints is a little more surprising: QB Carson Wentz.\n\nNBC Sports\u2019 Peter King sat in on Sean Payton\u2019s Saturday night meeting with the team and both players were singled out by the coaching staff\u2026\n\nThe all-coaches meeting has a discussion of injuries and who will be active and inactive, and a message from Payton. Two things tonight: \u201cWe gotta run right at 22 [Jones] and we gotta throw at 22. We\u2019re gonna make him defend the run on the first play. We\u2019re going after him on three of the first eight plays.\u201d And then, a bit of a surprise. \u201cWe want to put the game on [Eagles quarterback Carson] Wentz,\u201d Payton said. Payton likes Wentz as a player, but his player-personnel analyst, Ryan Herman, gives him trends and numbers every week, and Payton tells the group two interesting ones about Wentz, from Herman: The Eagles are 1-11 when Wentz plays and they allow more than 26 points. And he\u2019s 0-9 when he passes for between 308 and 364 yards, the point being if he does that, the Eagles likely won\u2019t be running the ball well, and the Saints feel they can beat a one-dimensional offense.\n\nAs counterintuitive as the Saints\u2019 plan to put the game in Wentz\u2019s hands may have sounded at the time, the strategy worked. Wentz played what might have been the worst game of his young career. He completed just 57.6% of his passes for 156 yards and three interceptions.\n\nThe Eagles offense is so much better when its running game gets going. That hasn\u2019t happened nearly enough in 2018, and Wentz hasn\u2019t been able to replicate the amazing success he had on third downs in 2017. He had been playing well coming into Sunday\u2019s loss but not well enough to elevate the entire offense. When Wentz plays as poorly as he did in New Orleans, the Eagles don\u2019t stand much of a chance.\n\nJones didn\u2019t play much better. Before leaving the game with another hamstring injury, he missed a key tackle on Mark Ingram\u2019s 38-yard touchdown run.\n\nMark Ingram for a gain of 38#GoSaints pic.twitter.com/9j3hE9OqlY \u2014 Gabriel Schray PXP (@schrayguy) November 18, 2018\n\nJones also gave up three catches for 42 yards on just four targets.\n\nThe loss sent the Eagles to 4-6 on the season. The defending Super Bowl champs are just one game ahead of the Giants for third place in the NFC East.\n\nYou can read King\u2019s piece on the Saints in its entirety here."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, William Cummings, USA TODAY", "title": "Group of House Democrats pledge to oppose Nancy Pelosi's bid to return as House Speaker", "description": "\"We are thankful for Leader Pelosi for her years of service to our Country and our Caucus,\" but \"the time has come for new leadership,\" they said.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/19/nancy-pelosi-speaker-opposition/2057427002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/07/USAT/0f535fc5-5615-45fc-bd5b-a633ba8354de-GTY_1058424678.jpg?crop=3954,2224,x504,y1002&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:09:23Z", "content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi speaks during an election watch party at the Hyatt Regency on November 6, 2018, in Washington, DC.

(Photo: Jeannine Rublee)\n\nFrom the day it opened in 1990, Shadow Creek Golf Course, the host of the mano-a-mano match between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson the day after Thanksgiving, was cloaked in mystique and shrouded in secrecy.\n\nFrom its eye-opening price tag \u2014 anywhere from $45 million to $60 million \u2014 to its location in the Mojave Desert 15 miles north of the Las Vegas Strip, to its esteemed clientele of high-rollers, captains of industry, sports icons and stars of the silver screen, Shadow Creek quickly became a bucket list dream for anyone who has put a peg in the ground.\n\nThrough word of mouth, this mesmerizing golf course near the city that\u2019s never done subtle and lives and breathes on extravagance has tugged on the hearts of golfers worldwide.\n\nWoods was among those who fancied a tee time once, and he counted down the days until he stepped on the property a few years before his red shirt started to mean something on Sundays.\n\n\u201cThe first time I played it, I met Elizabeth Taylor on the 17th tee. And that kind of stuck out because, well, you don't meet people like that when you are a kid,\u201d said Woods, who later that day learned that the late King of Pop, Michael Jackson, often sat near the 17th hole\u2019s waterfall down by the green.\n\nIn his active days, George H.W. Bush was a member and had a fishing pole above his locker as he often tried his luck in the course\u2019s streams, ponds and lakes. Former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have lockers in the unassuming clubhouse, as do Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, John Elway and Derek Jeter, as well as Sylvester Stallone and Matt Damon.\n\nThe course hasn\u2019t lost any of its glamour, glitz or guts since its grand opening, and alongside Woods and Mickelson, it deserves its rightful place as a headliner for The Match. It\u2019s a grand stage for the high-stakes battle between this generation\u2019s best players and biggest stars, a man-made marvel of nature\u2019s treasures that will challenge both players and stun onlookers.\n\n\u201cWhen I first played it in the early \u201990s, there wasn\u2019t a thing around the property. It was all desert and in the middle of it was Shadow Creek. It was an oasis in the middle of the desert, a mirage that was stunning,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a spectacular golf course. Not only is it aesthetically beautiful, it has incredible risk-reward holes with plenty of birdie and eagle opportunities.\n\n\u201cThere are some holes that favor me and there are some holes that favor Tiger, and that speaks to the beauty of the design.\u201d\n\nSprung from the fertile imagination of Steve Wynn, the casino mogul whose foresight helped transform the Strip to what it is today, Shadow Creek surfaced from the handiwork of renowned architect Tom Fazio, who was commissioned to build a golf masterpiece without restrictions on its price tag.\n\n\u201cSteve told me he wanted to build a golf course as good as anything in the world. When I saw the land, I thought he was crazy,\u201d Fazio said. \u201cBut whatever I wanted to do, I did.\u201d\n\nWhat he did was create an environment where none existed except 350 acres of lifeless, hardened desert. Fazio and his builders started the transformation by digging 50 feet into the chunk of the earth \u2014 about 3 million cubic yards of dirt was excavated. This allowed Fazio to carve out rolling hills and canyons. The massive mining also provided enough dirt to create a berm around the property to help keep the sun out of the players\u2019 eyes. Instead, majestic mountain ranges glisten in the distance.\n\nTiger Woods and Phil Mickelson walk down the 11th fairway during a practice round for the Masters at Augusta National on April 3. (Photo: Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSome 20,000 of more than 200 varieties of trees were imported and form a lush forest throughout the property that casts shadows over emerald fairways and greens, waterfalls, creeks, ponds, brooks, lagoons and lakes. The woods are so thick, no hole can be seen from another.\n\nThe unique environment also is home to lively vegetation; vibrant, multihued floral decorations; and exotic birds including swans and blue herons, pheasants with 6-foot tails, as well as rabbits and other critters. There\u2019s even a red London telephone booth on the ninth tee.\n\n\u201cIt's a fun place. We\u2019ve had some great games,\u201d Woods said. \u201cAnd the scenery is unbelievable. You think you are in North Carolina or something, or Colorado with the mountains and the pine trees and the waterfalls. What Steve Wynn did there is nothing short of a miracle.\u201d\n\nFollowing an expensive renovation in 2006 that sand-capped the course, lengthened it and expanded some greens for more pin placements, the par-72 layout can tip out at 7,560 yards. While every hole could be the course\u2019s signature hole, the ones that could prove pivotal in The Match are the 553-yard, par-5 fourth that is mindful of Augusta National\u2019s historic 13th; the 409-yard, par-4 ninth; and the two closing holes \u2014 the 164-yard, downhill, par-3 17th and the 564-yard, water-protected par-5 18th.\n\n\u201cI think the par-3s are going to be key,\u201d said Mickelson, who held the course record before Woods went one better with a 61, which was later matched by Fred Couples.\n\nSince the renovation, Dustin Johnson has the record with a 65. \u201cAll the holes will be important, but the par-3s will be pivotal because most likely we\u2019ll have some closest-to-the-pin contests,\" Mickelson added. \"If that happens, there is going to be a little more emphasis on those holes.\u201d\n\nFor a decade, one could only play Shadow Creek by invitation. But since 2000, when Wynn sold his holdings to MGM Resorts International, anyone can play the course. It\u2019s a hefty price \u2014 one must stay at an MGM Las Vegas property, and the green fee is $500 plus gratuity for the mandatory caddie.\n\nThree-time major champion Jordan Spieth said it\u2019s worth consideration.\n\n\u201cI was very wowed by Shadow Creek the first time I played it, and I\u2019ve played it a few times since and you\u2019re still stunned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an unbelievable golf experience, one of the top ones I\u2019ve ever had in the country.\n\n\u201cI like the mixture of holes. You have drivable par-4s and then you have long doglegs. The green complexes are complicated and very challenging. You can score on the course, but it also presents a legitimate challenge.\n\n\u201cHopefully it comes down to the finish. The par-3 17th is just a 9-iron, but it\u2019s to a tiny green surrounded by water. And the par-5 18th has water in play, so, yes, you can make an eagle, but you can easily make bogey.\u201d\n\nThe competition, the side bets, the banter between Woods and Mickelson will highlight the pay-per-view telecast. As will Shadow Creek.\n\n\u201cOne unique thing about this will be the drone coverage,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have different perspectives on every shot, which you can\u2019t do with 150 guys but you can do with two guys. That will incorporate the course. You will get better aerial views of what the players are facing and that will showcase the course. And it\u2019s quite a course, believe me.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Hasan Dudar, USA TODAY", "title": "Americans divided on caravan migrant as threat to US: poll", "description": "A majority of Americans see the migrant caravan as some kind of threat, but a larger majority believe they should be able to enter the country.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/19/migrant-caravan-donald-trump-border-security-immigration-poll-threat-central-america-honduras/2055361002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/10/USAT/3cbf152e-8d51-4581-a968-68b6cef4acec-2177.jpg?crop=1709,961,x1,y36&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:59:02Z", "content": "epa07154569 Members of the third migrant caravan, from El Salvador, arrive at the municipality of Mat\u00edas Romero, in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, 09 November 2018.

The Giants scored 38 points and had control pretty much the entire game.\n\nWith the Giants\u2019 third win of the season, they gained ground on the Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Redskins in an NFC East race that seems a little less crazy for the Giants to catch up on.\n\nLet\u2019s dig in and see how the Giants fared against the Bucs on Sunday.\n\nOffense\n\nQuarterback \u2013 Grade A\n\nWhat was that? You wanted to take points away for the one incompletion that could have been caught? You wanted to blame him for the sacks he took instead of forcing the ball to someone who wasn\u2019t open?\n\nEli Manning was nearly perfect on Sunday. He completed 17 of 18 passes for 231 yards and two touchdowns. The lone incompletion was a throw to the back shoulder of Saquon Barkley, which could have probably been caught. Manning led the team down the field on their first two drives in the game to give the Giants a 14-point lead early. Manning never put the ball in danger and gave the critics little to talk about this week.\n\nThe play calling certainly helped Eli and the Giants ,but the running game might have been the recipe to the Giants\u2019 success Sunday as they controlled the tempo of the game.\n\nRunning Back \u2013 Grade: A\n\nI had trouble not giving the running back position an A+ here. Saquon Barkley had himself a day with two touchdowns on the ground and one through the air. On 29 total touches, Barkley posted 152 yards and nearly broke away for two long touchdown plays. You could see the frustration, as he wasn\u2019t able to get passed the last guy on each of those runs.\n\nWayne Gallman chipped in with two carries for 11 yards, giving he and Barkley a combined 5.28 yards per carry on Sunday. Gallman was featured in the passing game as he hauled in both of his two targets for 24 yards.\n\nBecause the running game was so successful, the Giants did not have to do much in the passing game throughout the game.\n\nWide Receiver \u2013 Grade A\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. had a really underrated touchdown catch that most receivers would have dropped. He also had a 41-yard catch on the opening drive to set the pace of the game. Beckham may have only had four receptions in the game, but he also had a nice carry that went for a first down to give him a total of 85 yards on the day.\n\nManning ended up spreading amongst his receivers and tight ends as Beckham was the only one with more than two catches. Corey Coleman, who has been impressive in the return game, notched his second catch as a Giant since being promoted from the practice squad.\n\nSterling Shepard had an impressive juke one of his two catches as he dodged a defender immediately after he caught it. Unfortunately the play was called back because his knee was down but the move was impressive nonetheless as Shepard wowed the hometown crowd.\n\nTight End \u2013 Grade A-\n\nI guess if you really want to nitpick here you could say they didn\u2019t do much. Evan Engram caught both of his targets that were thrown his way. Rhett Ellison also caught his long target. Who knows if it was by design or not, but Engram\u2019s target total has decreased over the last two games. For the second straight game, Engram made a key catch late in the game to help the team secure a victory.\n\nOffensive Line \u2013 Grade: B+\n\nThe offensive line did allow three sacks, including 1.5 to former teammate Jason Pierre-Paul, who continues to impress this season.\n\nOverall the offensive line gave their best effort and it showed heavily in the success of the running game. The line played with confidence all game long, which really gave the Eli Manning and Pat Shurmur confidence in the running game."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 4 Michigan mum on Winovich's status at No. 10 Ohio State", "description": "No. 4 Michigan mum on DE Chase Winovich's status at No. 10 Ohio State", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/19/no-4-michigan-mum-on-winovichs-status-at-no-10-ohio-state/38564865/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb87b455186f76ee7c5259d0c05878c3e40a2d31/c=0-172-3286-2020/local/-/media/2018/11/19/USATODAY/usatsports/2dce1ac0d4064f4c954d32eb45e06941.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:51:00Z", "content": "Michigan defensive lineman Chase Winovich winces on the ground before leaving the game with an injury in the second half of an NCAA college football game in Ann Arbor, Mich., Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018.

It\u2019s something he does a lot these days, ever since he published a now widely read piece in The Players\u2019 Tribune about his own mental health struggles.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough topic, but now that the flood gates are open, Love almost can\u2019t help himself. He opens up quickly and candidly about his journey with depression and anxiety, sharing personal details without hesitation. Nothing, it seems, is off limits, especially if it means helping other people. We\u2019ve only been chatting a few minutes, and Love opens up readily, sharing how his depression affected his entire family.\n\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019d lose you\u2019,\u201d Love recounts his brother saying. \u201c\u2018You\u2019d go into your room, and Kevin would come out whenever Kevin would come out.\u2019 He was just like, you just weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nIt can be hard to share these stories, but talking about his issues publicly has not only been healing, Love says, but set him on a new path of mental health advocacy.\n\n\u201cI just saw the massive impact it had,\u201d Love said of the initial article. \u201cWe set up a form through the Players Tribune and I got 6,000 emails in three days.\u201d\n\nThe response was overwhelming and gratifying, and since then, Love has leaned into the conversation. Too many men keep silent about these issues, something Love is all too aware of.\n\n\u201cWith my depression, I would just sit in my room, because I didn\u2019t know how to cope,\u201d Love said. \u201cI would never cry\u2026but now I can finally just let some things go, and that has been very therapeutic for me.\u201d\n\nLove not only wants to talk about mental illness, but wants to chip away at the notions of toxic masculinity that keep many men from acknowledging these issues.\n\nEarlier this month, Love launched the Schick Hydro Locker Room Talk series, which featured candid conversations about mental health with Michael Phelps, Channing Frye and Paul Pierce. It was necessary, Love said, to show that even famous athletes at their peak often struggled.\n\n\u201cAs athletes a lot of the times, on both sides, men and women, we are treated like super heroes who are indestructible,\u201d Love said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t see the layers to it. Success doesn\u2019t make you immune to depression.\u201d\n\nDepression and anxiety don\u2019t exist in a vacuum and as Love has dug deeper into his own issues, he\u2019s seen how they intertwine with complicated notions of traditional masculinity. Among the things that Love hopes to change is the stigma many men face when it comes to admitting that things might not be going OK.\n\n\u201cI was taught to not show any weakness,\u201d Love said. \u201cMy dad said, \u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 because he was from an era where they don\u2019t do that. And his father before him never talked about anything. Whereas my mother was very affectionate, always communicated with with my sister, who learned how to express herself. But, as a boy I just had a short fuse, I didn\u2019t know how to cope, and as I got into my young adulthood, that became anxiety.\u201d\n\nLove brings up that story not to throw his dad under the bus, but to illustrate destructive generational patterns. His father pushed him to be stoic and resilient, which had its upside, but it also left him without the tools to cope when things went wrong. It\u2019s a pattern Love sees repeating itself with young men today.\n\n\u201cKids in middle school\u2026at that age, you have these health classes, physical health, sex ed, but I was never taught about mental health, ever. It was never a discussion,\u201d Love said \u201cThe only discussion I had was with my father, and that was, \u2018Keep your head up.\u2019 And that message is coming from all sides, especially for boys.\u201d\n\nIf talking about his own issues help break down some of the barriers men face, then Love is happy to do it. He\u2019s seen firsthand how life changing it can be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to be a lot more honest not just with myself, but with everyone,\u201d Love said. \u201cCommunication has allowed for better relationships with people around me. It\u2019s just not just talking, it\u2019s communication as a whole.\u201d\n\nCheck out more of our interview on the For The Win podcast"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz, USA TODAY", "title": "Redskins sign Mark Sanchez as backup QB after Alex Smith's injury", "description": "Mark Sanchez last served as a backup to Mitchell Trubisky in 2017 with the Bears, but the veteran QB has found his landing spot.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2018/11/19/washington-redskins-mark-sanchez-signed-alex-smith-injury/2056967002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/18/USAT/929fea34-662c-4027-a2bd-dd46157f22b4-USATSI_10214126.jpg?crop=3032,1706,x0,y192&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:43:19Z", "content": "Chicago Bears quarterback Mark Sanchez (6) warms up prior to a game against the Denver Broncos at Soldier Field.

(Photo: Jim Dedmon, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIn the final seconds of Philadelphia\u2019s 122-119 overtime road victory against Charlotte on Saturday, All-Star Jimmy Butler blocked Kemba Walker\u2019s shot, saved the ball from going out of bounds and hit the game-winning three-pointer with 0.3 seconds left.\n\nIt happened in a 20-second sequence, and that it is why the Sixers acquired Butler in a trade with Minnesota. It was his defense and shot-making on display in a huge moment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying since the summer we\u2019ve been looking for another star and we felt we needed another shooter, a three-and-D wing, someone like Jimmy,\u201d Sixers owner Josh Harris told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThey\u2019re hard to find at this elite level. We know who we have to get through to win the East. It\u2019s obvious who it is. We think this is a piece we needed.\n\n\u201cIt gives us three top-20 players. It positions us to ultimately to win a championship and go deeper into the playoffs this season.\u201d\n\nThe Sixers showed interest in trading for Butler right after it became public Butler wanted out of Minnesota. Philadelphia\u2019s initial trade offer was turned down with the Timberwolves\u2019 counteroffer asking for another starter in addition to Dario Saric, Robert Covington and Jerryd Bayless.\n\nBut Sixers general manager Elton Brand, who is in his first season as an NBA GM, never ruled out re-engaging with Minnesota, and when the timing was right, the teams made the trade. He\u2019s won over ownership.\n\n\u201cHe knows the players, and he knows how they think and how to motivate them. He\u2019s a leader. He\u2019s very well respected around the league,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing a trade like this, (Timberwolves GM) Scott Layden or whoever is calling him back, they want to engage with him and he\u2019s able to use those relationships to have a dialogue that allows you to do something like this.\u201d\n\nWhile Brand handled trade talks with Minnesota\u2019s front office, namely Layden, Harris discussed the deal with Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor, who got involved to make sure Minnesota got a deal done.\n\nIt\u2019s just three games, but Butler is averaging 19 points and shooting 57.9% from the field and 42.9% on three-pointers. With Butler on the court, the Sixers score 111.7 points per 100 possessions, up from their season average of 106.7 points per 100 possessions, according to nba.com/stats.\n\nHe adds versatility to the offense. As The Washington Post pointed out, the Sixers run a lot of dribble handoff plays while Minnesota used a lot of pick-and-rolls. Butler can operate in both sets.\n\nWhile the Sixers are working through defensive issues after the trade, Butler\u2019s defense should make the Sixers better on that end. Being able to guard a point guard like Walker one night and a shooting guard like Devin Booker the next game is significant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a decent amount of time with Jimmy,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly hard working. He\u2019s disciplined. He wants to win. He\u2019s a veteran presence. He knows what it takes to win. I\u2019ve been incredibly impressed with him in the short time he\u2019s been around the team and around me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really optimistic about our future. I\u2019m trying not to get ahead of myself.\u201d\n\nFollow Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY Opinion, Eileen Rivers, USA TODAY Opinion", "title": "Maher compares Trump theory to 'Brady Bunch'", "description": "The late-night comics on congressional freshmen and midterms in Best of Late Night.

McCoy will start Thursday when the Redskins visit the Dallas Cowboys in a Thanksgiving showdown that will go a long way to determining who wins the NFC East, and the 32-year-old has the full confidence of the coaching staff and players to take over for the rest of the season.\n\n\"I just feel very comfortable with Colt and always have,\" coach Jay Gruden said. \"It's been a luxury to have him as a backup quarterback and now it's a great opportunity for him to take the reins. I know he's excited about it. He's a guy that knows the system, he's a competitor, accurate with the football, understands where to go with the football \u2014 we assume \u2014 but we'll see on Thursday.\"\n\nUntil Sunday, McCoy hadn't thrown a pass in a regular-season game since 2015. The Cowboys game will be his first start since 2014, the same season he beat Dallas on the road on Monday night.\n\nThat was ages ago in NFL time, but there's a reason McCoy has been on the roster since Gruden came to Washington. His knowledge of the offense was evident even to Houston Texans players when McCoy seamlessly took over for Smith.\n\n\"He's been here for years,\" Texans cornerback Johnathan Joseph said. \"He understands the offense well. There's been a point in time where they were talking about him being the starter. So it's good to have two guys that can come in. As soon as he came in the game, it was like they never dropped off from where they were.\"\n\nWhether backing up Robert Griffin III, Kirk Cousins or Smith, McCoy has developed a reputation among teammates for being ready to play in a heartbeat. Center Chase Roullier said McCoy treats each day leading the scout team in practice as his Super Bowl, and no one has ever said the former University of Texas star was unprepared.\n\n\"Even last year when he didn't I think get a single snap all season, he prepared like he was the starter then,\" linebacker Ryan Kerrigan said. \"To have that mentality and to be that consistent with that mentality really speaks volumes to him as a professional.\"\n\nMcCoy, who started for Cleveland and San Francisco earlier in his career, has only appeared in nine games over the past three-plus seasons with Washington. Practice is one thing, and McCoy realizes game action is a different animal.\n\n\"I've still got to knock a little bit of rust off and get ready on a short week,\" McCoy said after going 6 of 12 or 54 yards and a touchdown Sunday against Houston. \"It's tough. It's not ideal. I think for me I've been here a little while. Haven't taking reps with these guys in three of four years, so I think there will be a little bit of a transition there but probably more for me than for them.\"\n\nIt's a tough turnaround for Sanchez, but Gruden said the Redskins signed him because of his NFL experience and familiarity with offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh and quarterbacks coach Kevin O'Donnell from his time with the New York Jets. Sanchez got the nod over Kellen Clemens, T.J. Yates, EJ Manuel and Josh Johnson after all five worked out at the team's facility Monday.\n\n\"He's won some playoff games, has got a lot of experience,\" Gruden said. \"I think this time of the year you need somebody who's taken some meaningful snaps with a lot of experience, and Mark's done that.\"\n\nNOTES: Gruden said Smith's surgery went well and expects the QB to make a full recovery in six to eight months. ... RB Chris Thompson, who has missed the past three games with injured ribs, said he's feeling \"a whole lot better\" and hopes to be a game-time decision. ... CB Quinton Dunbar (shin) and LT Trent Williams (thumb) are possibilities to return at Dallas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Even after his last trip to free agency dragged into January, Kurt Suzuki wanted to go the open market again.\n\nThis time, the catcher found a home much quicker.\n\nSuzuki on Tuesday finalized a $10 million, two-year contract to return to the Washington Nationals. The 35-year-old gets $4 million next year and $6 million in 2020, up from $3.5 million last season, his second with the Atlanta Braves.\n\nSuzuki is the first player of the 164 who hit free agency after the World Series to switch teams and the ninth with a finalized agreement.\n\n\"Obviously the last time I went to free agency wasn't as fun,\" Suzuki said during a conference call. \"It's a lot nicer, more peace of mind knowing where you're going to be, especially for the next two years. I'm 35 years old. I feel like I've been getting better as a player. I feel like I have a lot to offer for younger players, as well. I just try to go with it.\"\n\nHe hit .271 with 12 homers and 50 RBIs in 2018 as Atlanta won the NL East ahead of the second-place Nationals. General manager Mike Rizzo announced the finalized agreement Tuesday after Suzuki passed a physical.\n\nSuzuki played for Washington in 2012 and 2013, part of a 12-year major league career in which he has been with four clubs and batted .258 with 114 home runs and 619 RBIs.\n\n\"The last two years at age 33 and 34 kind of had like a renaissance I guess,\" Suzuki said. \"I really haven't changed much. I go out there and I don't really think about launch angles or all these kind of analytical things. I go out there and I just try to do some damage, and whenever they throw me a pitch that I think I can do damage with, I swing.\"\n\nHe made the AL All-Star team in 2014 while with the Minnesota Twins.\n\nA right-handed hitter, Suzuki could wind up as part of a platoon at catcher for the Nationals, who have been in the market for help at that position after Matt Wieters batted under .240 in each of the past two seasons there.\n\n\"Whether I'm a guy that catches 120 games or 90 games or whatever they want me to do, I just told (Rizzo) I'd be ready to do whatever you want,\" Suzuki said.\n\nWashington is coming off an 82-80 season, its first under manager Dave Martinez, following two consecutive division titles and first-round playoff exits. Suzuki, who turned down a contract offer from Atlanta to become a free agent, said it was a \"good gamble\" based on the deal he got from Washington, a team he called a perennial World Series contender.\n\n\"We've got everything that it takes to win a World Series,\" Suzuki said. \"I love our chances for this year. I think we've got all the talent and all the tools to go out there and win.\"\n\nSo far, Washington's offseason moves have centered on the bullpen, including exercising up closer Sean Doolittle's option and signing former St. Louis Cardinals closer Trevor Rosenthal.\n\nThe Nationals are also expected to seek help for their starting rotation as well as a new second baseman.\n\nThe biggest question of all that looms over the next few months, of course, is what will happen with outfielder Bryce Harper, the 2015 NL MVP who is a free agent.\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The Tennessee Titans need the extra day off before their next game both to allow injuries to heal and figure out what went wrong in their worst loss this season.\n\nMarcus Mariota is recovering from a stinger that knocked him out of the Titans' 38-10 loss to the Colts, not the elbow injury announced during the game. Coach Mike Vrabel said all tests were positive on defensive coordinator Dean Pees, who returned to Nashville on Monday. Pees spent a night in an Indianapolis hospital after an issue forced him from the coaches' box early in the game.\n\nVrabel also said he is hopeful Mariota will play when the Titans visit Houston on Nov. 26 and Pees also will return to work, even his boss plans to limit the coordinator to banker's hours of 9 to 5.\n\n\"I just want to make sure that he's getting plenty of rest and that we're not rushing anything,\" Vrabel said. \"We do have an extra day with the Monday night game.\"\n\nWhether Mariota misses his third start this season depends on how quickly he recovers from what Vrabel called a bad stinger with a hit to the head. Mariota was hurt when sacked for the fourth time late in the first half, and he did not return with what was announced as an injury to his elbow. Mariota was forced from the season opener after hurting his right elbow.\n\nMariota was hit in the head, and Vrabel said the independent neurologist evaluated the quarterback and cleared Mariota.\n\n\"Like a lot of players, he got a bad stinger,\" Vrabel said. \"So, we'll have to see where he's at.\"\n\nVrabel said that may include Mariota getting a second opinion. Mariota did not speak to reporters after the game because he was receiving treatment, and the quarterback was not in the locker room Monday when it was open to the media. Vrabel said a stinger can leave some numbness down the arm, and Mariota dealt with some numbness in his fingers after his elbow injury.\n\nHis coach hopes Mariota will be available against the Texans. Mariota missed the first game between these teams in Week 2, a 20-17 win by the Titans and backup Blaine Gabbert.\n\n\"We're hopeful that he'll check out and feel good enough to play on Monday,\" Vrabel said. \"Just being less than 24 hours after the game, some of these things take a little bit of time to cool down and really just treat and diagnose.\"\n\nVrabel said he told Pees, 69, not to come to work once back in Nashville. Vrabel thanked the Colts and Indianapolis general manager Chris Ballard for checking on Pees and his wife while the Titans flew home Sunday.\n\n\"Everything that would be really worrisome has been ruled out from the neurologist in Indy,\" Vrabel said.\n\nThe Titans (5-5) have to figure out what went wrong against the Colts, a surprise after routing the Patriots 34-10 the week before. They now trail Houston (7-3) by two games in the AFC South, and this is the first of three games in an 11-day span for Tennessee. They host the Jets on Dec. 2 and then the Jaguars on Dec. 6.\n\nVrabel said the Titans aren't finished yet this season.\n\n\"We're still in this race as bad as it was, and it was bad,\" Vrabel said of the loss to the Colts. \"Put it all on me. I've lost five games and the players have won five. So, I have to do a better job of not losing them and they have to do a better job of winning them.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

You just poke a tiny hole in the end of each egg (to let out steam and excess moisture so the eggs don't burst), add a little water to the tray, press a button, and wait. In 12-ish minutes, you've got perfect hard-boiled eggs. The best part? They're super easy to peel.\n\nGet the Dash Rapid Egg Cooker for $14.99 (Save $4)\n\n4. An Echo Spot bundle that's practically a BOGO\n\nThe Spot looks great on a desk, shelf, or countertop (but the stand is not included). (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nThe Echo Spot is my personal favorite of all Amazon's smart assistant devices, and it won our Editors' Choice award. It blends the capabilities of Alexa and the display functionality in a small package that looks stylish and unobtrusive in any room (Sorry, Echo Show, but you're just too big). Right now, you can get two Echo Spots for $160, so you pay full price for one and get the second for $30. This is great whether you want to gift one to a relative or keep both for your own home.\n\nGet two Amazon Echo Spot Smart Displays for $159.98 (Save $100)\n\n5. The best electric kettle at the best price\n\nNothing gets you through a cold day like a hot cup of tea... or cocoa... or instant ramen. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you boil water, you need this kettle. There, I said it. Not only is it the best electric kettle we've tested, but it's my personal favorite. I had one once and replaced it with a lesser quality kettle and have been miserable since. Right now, Cuisinart has discounted the PerfecTemp kettle to the lowest price we've ever seen, so don't miss your chance to score this usually $90 appliance for just over $60.\n\nGet the Cuisinart PerfecTemp Electric Kettle for $60.83 (Save $29)\n\nPrices are accurate at the time this article was published, but may change over time.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.

The venues from those games remain in use three decades later and were the foundation of plans for another Winter Games and Paralympics.\n\nBut a cost-sharing agreement among the federal, provincial and municipal governments wasn't completed until Oct. 31 \u2014 less than two weeks before the vote at the polls.\n\nThe bid corporation Calgary 2026 estimated the total cost of hosting the games at $5.1 billion. The group asked for a $2.875 billion contribution split among the city, provincial and federal governments. The Alberta government committed $700 million and the Canadian government $1.45 billion. The city was asked to contribute $390 million.\n\n\"I'm disappointed in the plebiscite result and I think we will have a great deal of work to do as we move forward, because ultimately we did as a community say 'no' to a lot of funding,\" Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said in chambers. \"Now our job is, as it always is, to continue to try and replace that funding.\n\n\"Certainly, there are people who are happy about the plebiscite result, there are people who are disappointed about the plebiscite result, but ultimately it was an opportunity to think about ourselves and think about our future and I think that's a very good thing.\"\n\nHow to a pay for a new indoor field house, which the city has long identified as a recreational need, and the renewal of the '88 legacy facilities that have helped make Canada a winter-sport powerhouse remain a priority, the mayor said.\n\nThe plan for 2026 had committed $502 million to the '88 venues to get them ready again.\n\n\"I think that we agree that our legacy as a winter-sport city is a really important part of our identity and a really important part of who we are,\" Nenshi said.\n\nThe almost 2,000 housing units that would have been a 2026 legacy will not be affordable for the city in the short term, he added.\n\n\"That is the one I'm the most sad about,\" the mayor said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Quite the contrary. Being editor of a product review site makes you insanely nit-picky about even the most minor shortcomings.\n\nWhen it comes to shopping, my personal credo is that if you invest in good stuff and treat it well, it will treat you well in return. So it\u2019s with great care that I present this list of nine gifts that I absolutely love.\n\n1. Technivorm Moccamaster coffee maker\n\nTechnivorm Moccamaster coffee maker (Photo: Technivorm)\n\nA good cup of coffee isn\u2019t just the best way to start the day. As far as I\u2019m aware it\u2019s the only way. The Moccamaster is our top-rated coffee maker. Hand-made in the Netherlands, it produces a perfect cup every time thanks to a copper heating element. I\u2019ve owned mine for years without a single complaint.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $269\n\n2. Davek Solo Umbrella\n\nDavek Solo Umbrella (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nThere are umbrellas, and then there are compact, wind-resistant, durable as hell umbrellas with lifetime guarantees. I choose the latter. Davek umbrellas won\u2019t necessarily last forever, but if they do break the company will replace them (so long as you've held onto your receipt). They even make losing an umbrella less painful by offering a 50% replacement discount.\n\nGet it from Amazon for $109\n\n3. Sonos Playbar TV Soundbar\n\nSonos Playbar TV Soundbar (Photo: Sonos)\n\nNo matter how good your TV is, the built-in speakers are pretty lousy. A decent soundbar is an improvement, but a great soundbar turns your home into a theater. Sonos basically invented the easy-to-use connected speaker. The Sonos Beam is a newer, less expensive alternative, but I prefer the richer sounds and deeper bass of the Playbar (plus I already owned it!)\n\nGet it on Amazon for $699\n\n4. Diptyque Feu de Bois candle\n\nDiptyque Feu de Bois candle (Photo: Diptyque)\n\nFeu de Bois means \u201cwood fire\u201d in French, and damned if this isn\u2019t the best smelling candle I\u2019ve ever smelled in my life. One good Diptyque candle can get you through a whole winter. If you don\u2019t get one for yourself, they make a great gift.\n\nGet it from Nordstrom for $65.00\n\n4. Kindle Paperwhite\n\nKindle Paperwhite (Photo: Amazon)\n\nAs a writer and a lifelong reader, I used to hold with all the old arguments about never abandoning paper books. But two days after I received my first Kindle as Christmas gift, I was hooked. All those books I\u2019d wanted to read but dreaded lugging around for months (looking at you, Tolstoy) suddenly fit in my pocket. The newest Kindle has all the features I love on my circa-2015 edition, plus now it\u2019s waterproof.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $129\n\n5. Nintendo Switch\n\nNintendo Switch (Photo: Nintendo)\n\nNintendo isn\u2019t about specs or processors or bleeding-edge tech. It\u2019s about fun. And the Switch is fuuun! There\u2019s a library of great games for every age, which my son and I have been taking full advantage of. If you\u2019d ever seen a four-year-old\u2019s eyes light up as he solves one on of the temple puzzles in Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you\u2019d buy one too.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $200\n\n6. 8-Piece Tegu Pocket Pouch Magnetic Wooden Block Set\n\n8-Piece Tegu Pocket Pouch Magnetic Wooden Block Set (Photo: Tegu)\n\nAnother one for the kids, or for fidgety adults. These aesthetically pleasing wooden blocks have magnets inside that allow them to be assembled in a variety of patterns. Tegu sells a variety of colors and configurations, but I like the 8-piece set because the pieces are large enough, and few enough in number, that they make the perfect travel toy for kids. When he's finally asleep, I can play with them too.\n\nGet it Amazon $30.50\n\n7. The Bean Boot by L.L.Bean\n\nThe Bean Boot by L.L.Bean (Photo: L.L.Bean)\n\nYou can\u2019t beat a classic. With a design that\u2019s endured for over a century, these boots will see you through the wet and muck of the harshest weather. I like the 8\u201d height because it keeps the snow at bay, but they come in a variety of heights, colors, and materials.\n\nGet them from L.L. Bean for $135\n\n8. Harry & David pears\n\nHarry & David pears (Photo: Harry & David)\n\nIf you\u2019ve eaten one, you know. There is no fruit on earth that tastes as good as a Harry & David pear. When I was a kid I was allowed to have maybe half a pear from my grandparents\u2019 gift basket. Now I\u2019m an adult and I can buy them myself. But it\u2019s still more fun when someone gifts them to me, or when I give them to a newbie and watch their reaction as they dig in.\n\nGet 9 Royal Riviera pears from Harry & David for $29.99\n\n9.

Toronto defenseman Morgan Rielly has put himself into Norris Trophy contention and teammate Frederik Andersen is in the Vezina mix as the league's best goalie. But Nashville\u2019s Pekka Rinne has looked even sharper.\n\nCoach Mike Babcock (Maple Leafs), Peter Laviolette (Predators) and Jon Cooper (Lightning) all have their teams sitting atop the standings, but how about the work of Barry Trotz (Islanders), John Tortorella (Blue Jackets), Phil Housley (Sabres) and Bruce Boudreau (Wild)? Did you expect the Blue Jackets (fourth) and the Sabres (fifth) to be this good?\n\nBut not everyone is happy with their start. Here are other NHL people or teams that would like a do-over at the quarter-mark of the season:\n\n\u25baCenter Anze Kopitar, Los Angeles Kings: With nine points in 19 games, Kopitar, who has a $10 million cap hit, is on a pace for 34 points. It\u2019s Thanksgiving week and Kopitar is captain of the NHL\u2019s worst team\n\n\u25baCoach Mike Yeo, St. Louis Blues: The Blues made major offseason moves, including trading for Ryan O\u2019Rielly, but they are currently 30th out of 31 teams. Yeo has to be feeling the pressure. (Updated: The Blues fired Mike Yeo after 2-0 loss to Kings on Monday.)\n\n\u25baLeft wing James Neal, Calgary Flames: He was signed this offseason to score goals, and he has netted three in 21 games. That\u2019s a 12-goal pace for a player who has scored 20 or more goals for 10 consecutive seasons.\n\nMore: Pass or fail? How offseason NHL trade acquisitions are grading out in the first quarter\n\nMore: Brad Marchand protests phantom call by waving towel in penalty box, earning a misconduct\n\n\u25baGeneral manager Peter Chiarelli, Edmonton Oilers: You can feel the frustration in Edmonton, which has Connor McDavid and is not showing progress toward becoming a contending team. This is Chiarelli\u2019s fourth season with the Oilers.\n\n\u25baPittsburgh Penguins support players: Their top players continue to perform at a high level, but the supporting cast has struggled. Bryan Rust and Riley Sheahan have one goal apiece, and Derick Brassard has two, although he has been injured and has played in nine games. Daniel Sprong hasn\u2019t developed as expected. New acquisition Tanner Pearson has one goal in 19 games this season (three games with the Penguins). Defenseman Jack Johnson\u2019s plus-minus is minus-10. Pittsburgh is 7-8-4 this season.\n\n\u25ba Goalie Mike Smith, Calgary Flames: An .876 save percentage in a league where .910 is the average says what kind of season it has been for Smith.\n\n\u25baPhiladelphia Flyers penalty killers: The Flyers\u2019 68.4% penalty killing efficiency and .880 save percentage are the league's worst. They have given up 12 power play goals in 20 games.\n\n\u25baForward Kevin Fiala, Nashville Predators: This was supposed to be a breakthrough season for Fiala, but the skilled performer has only netted two goals. He also has a plus-minus of minus-7 on a team where every regular is plus.\n\n\u25baGoalie Matt Murray, Penguins: Murray was supposed to be one of the Penguins\u2019 difference-makers, but he has struggled for the first two months of the season. His .877 save percentage is well below his .913 career average.

It\u2019s something he does a lot these days, ever since he published a now widely read piece in The Players\u2019 Tribune about his own mental health struggles.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough topic, but now that the flood gates are open, Love almost can\u2019t help himself. He opens up quickly and candidly about his journey with depression and anxiety, sharing personal details without hesitation. Nothing, it seems, is off limits, especially if it means helping other people. We\u2019ve only been chatting a few minutes, and Love opens up readily, sharing how his depression affected his entire family.\n\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019d lose you\u2019,\u201d Love recounts his brother saying. \u201c\u2018You\u2019d go into your room, and Kevin would come out whenever Kevin would come out.\u2019 He was just like, you just weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nIt can be hard to share these stories, but talking about his issues publicly has not only been healing, Love says, but set him on a new path of mental health advocacy.\n\n\u201cI just saw the massive impact it had,\u201d Love said of the initial article. \u201cWe set up a form through the Players Tribune and I got 6,000 emails in three days.\u201d\n\nThe response was overwhelming and gratifying, and since then, Love has leaned into the conversation. Too many men keep silent about these issues, something Love is all too aware of.\n\n\u201cWith my depression, I would just sit in my room, because I didn\u2019t know how to cope,\u201d Love said. \u201cI would never cry\u2026but now I can finally just let some things go, and that has been very therapeutic for me.\u201d\n\nLove not only wants to talk about mental illness, but wants to chip away at the notions of toxic masculinity that keep many men from acknowledging these issues.\n\nEarlier this month, Love launched the Schick Hydro Locker Room Talk series, which featured candid conversations about mental health with Michael Phelps, Channing Frye and Paul Pierce. It was necessary, Love said, to show that even famous athletes at their peak often struggled.\n\n\u201cAs athletes a lot of the times, on both sides, men and women, we are treated like super heroes who are indestructible,\u201d Love said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t see the layers to it. Success doesn\u2019t make you immune to depression.\u201d\n\nDepression and anxiety don\u2019t exist in a vacuum and as Love has dug deeper into his own issues, he\u2019s seen how they intertwine with complicated notions of traditional masculinity. Among the things that Love hopes to change is the stigma many men face when it comes to admitting that things might not be going OK.\n\n\u201cI was taught to not show any weakness,\u201d Love said. \u201cMy dad said, \u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 because he was from an era where they don\u2019t do that. And his father before him never talked about anything. Whereas my mother was very affectionate, always communicated with with my sister, who learned how to express herself. But, as a boy I just had a short fuse, I didn\u2019t know how to cope, and as I got into my young adulthood, that became anxiety.\u201d\n\nLove brings up that story not to throw his dad under the bus, but to illustrate destructive generational patterns. His father pushed him to be stoic and resilient, which had its upside, but it also left him without the tools to cope when things went wrong. It\u2019s a pattern Love sees repeating itself with young men today.\n\n\u201cKids in middle school\u2026at that age, you have these health classes, physical health, sex ed, but I was never taught about mental health, ever. It was never a discussion,\u201d Love said \u201cThe only discussion I had was with my father, and that was, \u2018Keep your head up.\u2019 And that message is coming from all sides, especially for boys.\u201d\n\nIf talking about his own issues help break down some of the barriers men face, then Love is happy to do it. He\u2019s seen firsthand how life changing it can be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to be a lot more honest not just with myself, but with everyone,\u201d Love said. \u201cCommunication has allowed for better relationships with people around me. It\u2019s just not just talking, it\u2019s communication as a whole.\u201d\n\nCheck out more of our interview on the For The Win podcast"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Melissa Rorech", "title": "Does Target's new weighted blanket make the perfect present?", "description": "Weighted blankets make for great gifts!

I think she\u2019s very resourceful,\" Wolf said at the dinner. \"She burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Maybe she\u2019s born with it, maybe it\u2019s lies. It\u2019s probably lies.\"\n\nMore: The Bubble: Liberals and conservatives debate whether Michelle Wolf went too far\n\nMore: Michelle Wolf 'wouldn't change a single word' she said at White House Correspondents Dinner\n\nWolf's routine was criticized by many, including members of the press. Former WHCA President Margaret Talev later released a statement that Wolf's comments did not uphold the organization's mission to offer a \"unifying message about our common commitment to a vigorous and free press.\"\n\n\"Every day we are working hard to advocate for our members and ensure coverage that benefits the public, and the dinner is an important opportunity to highlight and maintain our essential work,\" the statement read.\n\nAfter WHCA's announcement on Monday, Wolf called the group \"cowards.\"\n\n\"The @whca are cowards. The media is complicit. And I couldn't be prouder,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe last time the dinner featured a non-comedian was in 2003, when singer Ray Charles provided entertainment.\n\nFor his part, Chernow promised that he wouldn't \"be dry.\"\n\n\"My major worry these days is that we Americans will forget who we are as a people and historians should serve as our chief custodians in preserving that rich storehouse of memory,\" Chernow said. \"While I have never been mistaken for a stand-up comedian, I promise that my history lesson won\u2019t be dry.\u201d\n\nKnox noted Chernow brings a \"deeply researched\" perspective on American politics. Chernow has chronicled the lives of many American businessmen, Founding Fathers and past presidents.\n\nHis most recent biography of President Ulysses Grant was named one of the 10 best books of the year by the New York Times.\n\nThe recipient of awards like the Pulitzer Prize for Biography and the National Medal for Humanities, Chernow said his speech at the WHCA dinner is a \"perfect moment to go back to basics\" on the First Amendment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has yet to attend the dinner, a notable departure from the conduct of past presidents. Trump has repeatedly called for the WCHA dinner to end, calling it a \"disaster and an embarrassment.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/11/19/biographer-ron-chernow-white-house-correspondents-association/2054295002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY", "title": "Senate Democrats launch legal challenge to Trump's appointment of acting Attorney General Whitaker", "description": "Senate Dems challenge Whitaker's AG appointment", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/19/senate-democrats-matthew-whitaker/2054188002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.kgw.com/assets/GANNETT/images/89f5d34e-d1ba-4aee-b01a-7665c7199a95/89f5d34e-d1ba-4aee-b01a-7665c7199a95_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:28:57Z", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Senate Democrats are going to court Monday to challenge the appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the third legal test of the former federal prosecutor's authority in less than a week.

(Photo: Steve Pope)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Senate Democrats went to court Monday to challenge the appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the third legal test of the former federal prosecutor's authority in less than a week.\n\nThe latest challenge, by Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, tracks two other court actions, arguing that Whitaker lacks the Senate confirmation required of all Cabinet officials.\n\nThe senators' filing in a District of Columbia federal court contends that President Donald Trump's appointment was unconstitutional.\n\n\"The U.S. Senate has not consented to Mr. Whitaker serving in any office within the federal government, let alone the highest office of the (Justice Department),\" the senators' lawsuit argues. \"Indeed, if allowed to stand, Mr. Whitaker's appointment would create a road map for the evasion of the constitutionally prescribed Senate advice-and-consent role.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, Whitehouse referred to Whitaker as \"an unconfirmed lackey\" who posed a threat to the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, led by Justice special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nBefore joining the Justice Department last year as chief of staff to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Whitaker was publicly critical of Mueller's inquiry and once raised the prospect of cutting off funding for the investigation.\n\n\"Unless the courts intercede, this troubling move creates a plain road map for persistent and deliberate evasion by the executive branch of the Senate's constitutionally mandated advice and consent,\" Whitehouse said. \"Indeed, this appointment appears planned to accomplish that goal.\u201d\n\nLast week, separate legal challenges were filed in Maryland and at the Supreme Court.\n\nVeteran Supreme Court litigator Thomas Goldstein asked the justices Friday to decide whether Whitaker was legally installed as the temporary successor to Sessions, who Trump ousted nearly two weeks ago.\n\nThe ultimate goal of all three challenges is the same: a federal court ruling declaring that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the legal and constitutional heir to Sessions.\n\nJustice officials defended Whitaker's appointment last week, issuing a 20-page opinion asserting that Whitaker\u2019s standing as a senior department executive \u201cunquestionably\u201d authorized the president to elevate the former Iowa federal prosecutor.\n\nJustice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel based its findings on provisions of the Vacancies Reform Act, which allows for the appointment of a senior staffer who has been in office for at least 90 days.\n\nBeyond the arguments over Whitaker's authority, Democrats and some Republicans seized on Whitaker's criticism of Mueller's inquiry and called for his recusal from overseeing the investigation.\n\nMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh filed his challenge in federal district court in Maryland last week, calling Whitaker's appointment \"illegal and unconstitutional.\" The case is scheduled to be heard Dec. 19 but could take months before reaching the Supreme Court.\n\nGoldstein's effort is aimed at leapfrogging lower courts and getting the justices to decide who Sessions' replacement should be, perhaps within weeks.\n\nMore: Supreme Court asked to rule on Trump's choice of Matthew Whitaker as

the league\u2019s most progressive owners\u201d and noted his active role in criminal justice reform, while also pointing out that Kraft\u2019s long-term approach to the success of the game is starkly juxtaposed with the average player\u2019s financial needs in the short-term.\n\nHowever while Kraft may fall in line with his fellow owners when it comes to prioritizing the viability of the league for years to come, he also continues to be one of the few to openly state that he believes former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick deserves to play in the NFL.\n\nVia the New York Times:\n\nMr. Kraft has a clear grasp, though, on why the Kaepernick issue still looms large for so many players and how urgent it is for the league to resolve it. \u201cLet me say this: I would very much like to see him in the league,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s an intriguing quote in a piece that highlighted Winston\u2019s desire to help the NFLPA successfully battle the owners in 2020 when the current collective bargaining agreement expires, painting the usual picture of a group of stodgy, out-of-touch billionaires who treat the players as pawns rather than people.\n\nKaepernick has been jobless since the end of the 2016 season, during which he controversially began protesting police brutality against black Americans by kneeling during the national anthem. He was arguably still playing well enough for him to be a starter in the league, and indisputably good enough for him to be a backup at the very least \u2013 but his protest sparked outrage among a significant swath of NFL viewers, and he found himself without a job at 29 years old, just four years after starting in Super Bowl XLVII."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Farewell ceremony for crew members of latest ISS", "description": "A farewell ceremony was held on Monday at Russia's Star City for crew members of the ISS expedition 58, ahead of an expected launch on December 3.

This, of course, is a new team with new stars like Barrett and Williamson, but these freshmen have embraced the spotlight's glare so far and there's little reason to believe it will be any different in Maui. (Mark Blinch/The Canadian Press via AP, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTwo of college basketball's bluebloods remained firmly entrenched atop the AP Top 25 after a week of easy wins, while two more tumbled all the way out after a week filled with defeats.\n\nOne of them happens to be the reigning national champion.\n\nWhile top-ranked Duke and No. 2 Kansas did little to hurt their status as early national title contenders, Villanova and Syracuse slid all the way out of the Top 25 on Monday. The Wildcats lost a rematch of last year's championship game with Michigan, then lost in overtime to Furman on Saturday to give coach Jay Wright's team back-to-back losses for the first time in five years.\n\nThe Wildcats had risen to No. 8 last week. They were among those receiving votes this week.\n\n\"We're trying to work out a lot of chemistry things with our team. We have a lot of new guys,\" Villanova guard Phil Booth said. \"We're trying to play more together and figure things out.\"\n\nIndeed, the Wildcats are trying to replace key players Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Donte DiVincenzo and Omari Spellman after last year's championship run. But while a strong recruiting class is trying to find its way, the Wildcats are off to a 2-2 start for the first time since 1997.\n\nThey're also the first national champion to start 2-2 since UCLA in 1995.\n\nThe Wildcats weren't the only big-time program to take a tumble this week. Syracuse dropped from No. 15 out of the poll after losing to Connecticut and Oregon in the 2k Classic.\n\n\"We have to play better offensively we're going to be successful. Our defense is nowhere near the point it was last year. That's something that also has to get better,\" said Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, whose team is 2-2 for the first time since the 1987-88 season. \"There's no doubt we have a lot of work to do. We're a long ways away.\"\n\nThe top five remained unchanged with Duke remained the clear No. 1, receiving 53 of 63 first-place votes after blowing out Eastern Michigan. Kansas was second with seven first-place votes after wins over Vermont and Louisiana-Lafayette, followed by Gonzaga, Virginia and Tennessee.\n\n\"I think in the past few days we grew up a bit more,\" said Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski, whose team played San Diego State in the first round of the Maui Invitational on Monday.\n\nGonzaga (3-0) and eighth-ranked Auburn (3-0) are also in the tournament.\n\n\"It's a great field,\" Krzyzewski said. \"You're playing three straight days, which will never happen otherwise during the season, so success or failure there has to be looked at a little bit closer. It's a great opportunity for competition, and there are some big-time teams in the tournament, which usually there are when we're in the tournament.\"\n\nAT THE TOP\n\nThe only major movement in the top 10 involved Villanova dropping out and Michigan (5-0) climbing from No. 18 to ninth. Nevada (3-0) remained sixth and North Carolina (4-0) seventh. Auburn moved up one spot and Kentucky (3-1) rounded out the first 10.\n\nBIG RISERS\n\nThe Wolverines were the biggest movers, while Virginia Tech (4-0) climbed three spots to No. 13. Clemson was No. 16, followed by UCLA, TCU and LSU after each of them also moved up three spots.\n\nALSO SLIDING\n\nMarquette joined Villanova and Syracuse in dropping from the poll after the Golden Eagles (3-1) were routed by Indiana. Oregon (3-1) dropped from No. 13 to No. 21 after splitting its games against Iowa and Syracuse in New York.\n\nBIG TEN NEWCOMERS\n\nIowa (4-0) leaped into the poll at No. 20 after beating Oregon and blowing out UConn to win the 2K Classic. It's the first time the Hawkeyes have been ranked since the final poll of the 2015-16 season.\n\nThe other newcomers this week were also from the Big Ten: Ohio State (4-0) entered at No. 23 after beating Creighton and South Carolina State, and Wisconsin squeaked in ahead of another Big Ten rival in Nebraska at No. 25 after the Badgers (3-0) took care of Xavier and Houston Baptist.\n\n___\n\nSee the full poll: https://collegebasketball.ap.org/poll\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Kelly Jordan, USA TODAY Network)\n\nThe scorched Northern California town of Paradise should get its first significant rainfall in six months this week, a forecast that would at least interrupt one of the most horrific fire seasons in state history.\n\nParadise could see up to 4 inches of rain Wednesday to Friday, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Kristina Pydynowski said.\n\n\"Once you get the first real rain, the fire season comes to an end,\" Pydynowski said. \"The fire threat falls significantly. But it is a double-edged sword.\"\n\nCLOSE Satellite images show how the Camp Fire destroyed nearly 12,000 homes in Paradise, California. USA TODAY\n\nCal Fire officials said changing climate conditions mean the fire season never fully ends. Still, the rains this week are likely to provide a huge boost for firefighters battling the historic Camp Fire, which was 70 percent contained Monday night.\n\nWith the precipitation comes new issues. Hundreds of workers scoured the incinerated shells of once beautiful homes in a desperate search for the charred remains of victims before rain washes them away.\n\nThe task is enormous. The Camp Fire, which has scorched 151,272 acres since it began Nov. 8, has destroyed more than 11,000 homes, more than 400 businesses and thousands of barns, sheds, garages and other structures. The confirmed death toll stood at 79 Monday night, but 699 names remain on the \"missing\" list, down from nearly 1,000 earlier in the day.\n\nThe searchers are armed with masks for breathing, sticks to poke through the rubble and cadaver dogs trained to locate human remains. Houses that have been checked are marked with bright orange paint.\n\nSheriff Kory Honea said it's possible that the exact death toll will never be known. The search for remains may not be completed before the rain, he said.\n\n\u201cAs much as I wish that we could get through all of this before the rains come, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible,\u201d Honea said.\n\nMore: 'How do you grieve for a whole town?' Paradise residents seek healing\n\nMore: Inside the Camp Fire perimeter, these residents stay put.\n\nBrian Ramsey, spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, said downpours and slippery roads can slow movement of firefighters, trucks and other equipment.\n\nThe hundreds of fire evacuees living in tents are also a concern. Sunday, officials tried to shut down a tent city outside a Walmart in nearby Chico because of cold temperatures and the forecast of rain. Many campers were shuttled to a shelter at the Butte County Fairgrounds.\n\nSome of the evacuees balked at moving to the indoor shelters.\n\n\u201cThere is a crisis now, and if we don\u2019t get this taken care of now, we\u2019re going to have another crisis,\u201d said Guido Barbero, who helps organize services for the evacuees.\n\nFlooding, ash flows and mudslides could pose another problem. The blackened earth will be helpless to absorb the rain.\n\n\"The one thing on everybody's mind is the landslide threat,\" Pydynowski said.\n\nShe said most of the terrain around Paradise is not particularly steep, but localized slides and flooding are possible. Areas victimized by previous fires have yet to heal and will be vulnerable, she said.\n\n\"Any recently scarred area is vulnerable,\" she said. \"The Mendocino Fire area hasn\u2019t had a chance to recover, even areas around the Ferguson Fire.\"\n\nThe Mendocino Complex Fire, which started in July, burned more than 700 square miles to become the largest fire in state history. The Ferguson Fire started a couple of weeks earlier and forced the closure of much of Yosemite National Park.\n\nThe long-range forecast calls for slightly above-normal rainfall in Northern California this winter, Pydynowski said. That will be good for dousing fires \u2013 and bad because it feeds vegetation that will dry out next summer and fuel the fires of 2019.\n\nContributing: Damon Arthur, Redding (California) Record Searchlight; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/19/california-fires-rains-finally-coming-scorched-paradise/2052993002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Thanksgiving.com, Grateful, Thanksgiving.com", "title": "Leftover Turkey Enchiladas", "description": "When these leftover turkey enchiladas come out of the oven, your family is going to race to the table and fight for the first indulgent bite.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/2018/11/19/leftover-turkey-enchiladas/2021637002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/02/USAT/2b32fb07-d4a8-470c-8336-fa7ab5c7586b-5D4B8454_-_Leftover_Turkey_Enchiladas_-_plated_enchilada_with_sour_cream_and_cilantro.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:00:47Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Our fresh takes on policing this week", "description": "News and opinion from outlets across the country culled by Policing the USA", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/19/gloria-steinem-black-lives-matter-policing-usa-prisons-arrested-while-black/2053009002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/3be57a3f-0705-4d63-9875-3a906308a266-GTY_135852467.JPG?crop=4102,2307,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:00:46Z", "content": "Author and feminist activist Gloria Steinem (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) We've put a new twist on our newsletter.

We know you're busy, and we want to provide you with a news and opinion filled way to start your week \u2014 our fresh takes. We'll publish them every Monday morning.\n\nBLM rules keep working for feminist Steinem\n\nFeminist Gloria Steinem hasn't hidden her respect for and support of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter \u2014 Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors. In an interview last year with The Grio she credited the women for creating \"a more inclusive movement.\" (More on that in a previous Policing the USA newsletter). She also stated the women \"don't get enough credit\" for tackling issues of sexism and racism that are at the root of discrimination in this country.\n\nWell Steinem put the work of these women on display again, this time in relation to an off-Broadway play about her work called \"Gloria: A Life.\" A special showing of the play last week was followed by a discussion about feminism. And the rules of engagement that Steinem wanted the audience to use for the tough talk were created by Garza, Tometi and Cullors. According to a piece in Quartz about the event, those rules are: lead with love, have a low ego, focus on things that have high impact and move at the speed of trust.\n\nPerhaps those rules should also be used to tamp down divisive sparring among politicians in Washington when it comes to discussing, among other things, protesters and ending police brutality.\n\nIt's now come down to yogurting while black?\n\nThe 911 caller implied that the black man sitting at a table in his frozen-yogurt shop in Washington could have been a homeless drug addict prepared to shoot up in the restroom. \"All my staff are women,\" the man said to the operator. \"They're kinda just scared. There was multiple incidents in our store before. ... And also, we got robbed before.\"\n\nAlthough, there was nothing about Byron Ragland, an Air Force veteran, that implied that he was homeless or a drug addict or a robber, the women who worked there called the shop owner, who called 911. In fact, Ragland was at the yogurt shop doing his job \u2014 supervising a visit between a mother who had lost a custody hearing and her 12-year-old son. They all took an innocent car ride to their local shop to get a treat, because the boy requested ice cream during his visit.\n\nPolice showed up in response to the 911 call, asked Ragland for identification and then (knowing that he was required to be there) asked him to leave. The 12-year-old boy and his mother also left.\n\nThe most suspicious thing Ragland was accused of during the 911 call: looking at his phone and then looking up, repeatedly.\n\nFor more on the incident, check out this Seattle Times report.\n\nNo safe place for female prison workers\n\nThe behavior described in a recent New York Times report is shocking: A female secretary at a California federal prison was locked in a ward so inmates could masturbate; another woman was discouraged by a male colleague from reporting an inmate who threatened to rape her; and the tables were turned on a Tucson case worker who reported being raped by a male inmate, but could now be locked up herself. The inmate said she raped him.\n\nAnd while women have been trying hard to protect themselves (they void tight clothing and makeup) and report incidents, the male managers who have been encouraging harassment in Bureau of Prisons facilities across the country and discouraging women from seeking discipline, have been getting promoted.\n\nWomen are about 33% of the workforce in the BOP's 122 prison facilities. The incidents of harassment were so bad at one Florida facility, that the bureau paid $20 million to Coleman prison's female workers. The women there endured, among other things, male inmates exposing themselves. Calls for backup during incidents went unanswered.\n\nCheck out the Policing the USA site for more information on police, policing and the justice system nationwide.\n\nWant to talk about police, race and the justice system in America?

It was unclear whether they had defense attorneys.\n\n6ix9ine has been one of the most ascendant and controversial names in hip-hop in recent months. His album Day69: Graduation Day was among the top records on iTunes following its February release.\n\nHe is also known for the multiplatinum hit \"Fefe\" with Nicki Minaj, which peaked at No. 3 on the pop charts, and \"Stoopid,\" featuring the incarcerated rapper Bobby Shmurda.\n\nBut 6ix9ine also has had a series of run-ins with law enforcement and has publicly identified himself as a member of a violent New York gang, 9 Trey Bloods.\n\nIn a superseding indictment unsealed Monday in Manhattan federal court, 6ix9ine was charged in connection with what prosecutors described as \"Nine Trey Gangasta Bloods,\" which they said carried out acts of murder, robbery and narcotics trafficking in Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn since at least 2013.\n\nThe indictment said each gang member was required to carry out at least two acts of racketeering conspiracy. Those acts could include murder, robbery, extortion and drug distribution, the court papers said.\n\nIn April, according to the indictment, 6ix9ine and others participated in a gunpoint robbery of the gang's rivals.\n\nThen in mid-July, the court papers said, the rapper joined three others and agreed to shoot an individual who had shown disrespect to gang members. However, an innocent bystander was shot on a Brooklyn street corner as a result of the agreement, the indictment said.\n\nThe 22-year-old recently pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in Brooklyn Criminal Court in connection with a May traffic stop.\n\nIn a 2015 case in New York, 6ix9ine was sentenced to probation for his involvement in a sexually explicit video of a 13-year-old girl.\n\nThe video, posted on social media, showed the girl performing a sex act on another man while 6ix9ine \"stands behind the child making a thrusting motion with his pelvis and smacking her on her buttocks,\" according to court documents.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/19/tekashi-6-ix-9-ine-indicted-federal-racketeering-and-firearms-charges/2055311002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jayne O'Donnell, USA TODAY", "title": "The US knows how to address its drinking problem, but proven fixes can be hard to sell", "description": "When officials wanted to reduce deaths from tobacco, they spoke of cancer risks, pushed for public bans and raised taxes.

Nearly all the potential solutions hit considerable roadblocks.\n\nThe Trump administration's tax cut last year included an 18 percent break in the federal tax on beer, wine and liquor.\n\nStates with more stringent alcohol control policies had lower rates of binge drinking, according to an analysis of state laws and taxes in 2014.\n\nBinge drinking accounts for about half of all deaths attributable to alcohol, two-thirds of years of life lost and three-quarters of economic costs.\n\nLegislative approaches to alcohol face many of the same challenges that tobacco bills do: Legislatures support their home state alcohol industries the way they resist policy threats to tobacco interests.\n\nLess than 60 percent of U.S. adults drink alcohol. If influencing legislators is the goal, David Jernigan says, that population includes the right people.\n\nMore: Alcohol kills more people, and younger. The biggest increases are among women\n\nMore: My 'bottom' was being drunk on TV. I'm grateful I hit it before I killed myself or others\n\nJernigan, a professor at Boston University's school of public health who has specialized in alcohol research for 30 years, says he doesn't drink because \"I like to keep my wits about me.\"\n\nNonetheless, he says, \"it's just so socially acceptable, especially among the people who write the laws. It's the drug of choice and incredibly normalized for upper-income people in the USA.\"\n\nAmong approaches that have shown results:\n\nRaising taxes: Alcohol is subjected to excise taxes, which are based on the volume sold, and sales taxes, which are based on the retail price. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a 10 percent increase in taxes leads to a 5 to 8 percent decline in drinking.\n\nFor states, that's good news and bad news. Though reductions in drinking might save states money on Medicaid for low-income and disabled residents, fewer sales reduce state revenue.\n\nDavid Jernigan is a professor at Boston University's school of public health who has studied alcohol for about 30 years. (Photo: Courtesy of David Jernigan)\n\nRichard Berman is CEO of the public affairs firm Berman & Co., which has represented the alcohol, tobacco and restaurant industries.\n\nHe says higher taxes can prompt people to trade down to less expensive brands, or if they live near a state line to go to a neighboring state with lower taxes.\n\nJernigan disagrees.\n\n\"Alcohol taxes are a win, win, win,\" he says. \"States get more money, and people drink somewhat less.\"\n\nRestricting sales. State and local governments often cap the number of liquor stores allowed in an area and the days and hours they can sell.\n\nThe Community Preventive Services Task Force, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, recommends that states resist privatizing alcohol sales, which is linked to a median 44 percent increase in sales, which leads to more drinking.\n\nStates that don't cap or control liquor sales have 50 percent more liquor stores per capita than those that do, Marathon Strategies reported in 2014.\n\nIn states that had caps based on population, there was one store for every 10,204 people. In states that didn't have caps, there was one store for every 5,737 residents.\n\nImproving access to treatment. Only about one in 10 people who need treatment for substance abuse receive the care they need, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration report in 2017.\n\nPsychologist Ben Miller, chief strategy officer at the nonprofit Well Being Trust, says people with addictions need to be identified earlier and linked to treatment \"at that first stop,\" including emergency rooms and jails.\n\nIntegrating mental health workers in primary care doctors' offices, he says, could \"help countless lives, save millions of dollars and begin to change the culture of care to be more comprehensive.\"\n\nPsychologist Benjamin Miller is the chief strategy officer at the nonprofit advocacy group the Well Being Trust. (Photo: The Well Being Trust)\n\nBolstering coping skills. About 15 percent of deaths attributed to alcohol are suicides. Addressing addiction would help address feelings of hopelessness.\n\nThe Well Being Trust called for a \"National Resilience Strategy.\"\n\nThe nonprofit group says investing in early childhood policies and programs would have the greatest impact.\n\nIn its Pain in the Nation report this year, the Well Being Trust called for better early identification of trauma and mental health problems in school-age children to help them deal with stress and trauma before they turn to alcohol and drugs as crutches.\n\n\"The most important substance we should be looking at is alcohol, because it leads to so many things, including physical abuse and rape, that shouldn't happen,\" Jernigan says. \"We need to stop accepting that there isn't anything we can do about it.\"\n\nIf you are interested in connecting with people online who have overcome or are struggling with health problems mentioned in this story, join USA TODAY\u2019s \"I Survived It\" Facebook support group.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/19/alcohol-taxes-restrictions-public-health-policy-problem-drinking-blue-laws/1729501002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "This man is on a mission to eradicate colon cancer", "description": "A stage 4 cancer diagnosis helped John MacLeod find his personal mission to eradicate colon cancer \u2014 for everyone", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/sponsor-story/exact-sciences/2018/11/19/man-mission-eradicate-colon-cancer/2055355002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/28911775001/28911775001_5969029703001_5969020374001-vs.jpg?pubId=28911775001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:48:48Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Indians acquire RHP Hu from Tampa for infielder Turner", "description": "Cleveland Indians acquire right-hander Chih-Wei Hu in trade from Tampa Bay Rays for infielder Gionti Turner", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2018/11/19/indians-acquire-rhp-hu-from-tampa-for-infielder-turner/38563895/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:47:55Z", "content": "CLEVELAND (AP) The Cleveland Indians have acquired right-hander Chih-Wei Hu (chee-way-hoo) in a trade with the Tampa Bay Rays for infielder Gionti Turner.

(Photo: Rogner Bad Blumau)\n\nVIENNA, Austria -- When you think of Austria, a Sound of Music song may pop into your ear. But this story is not about picturesque mountains and women in dresses singing in meadows.\n\nThis is a story about Styria, a state in southern Austria and in the heart of Europe, that may have found the best way for you to leave all your worries behind.\n\nStyria is known for exceptional wine, great food and thermal baths. Here's how to relax like a Styrian pro:\n\nStart your day by entering one of the thermal baths. Put on your bathing suit, wrap yourself in a soft bathrobe and enter the steamy-warm building. Take a bath in mineral spring water, relax in a dim-lighted sauna or doze off in a comfy sun lounger.\n\nIf you want to soak in a thermal bath that will make you feel like Alice in Wonderland visit Rogner Bad Blumau. This bath was designed by Friedensreich Hundertwasser, an Austrian-born artist and architect who is famous for his use of vibrant colors and disorienting shapes. No floor is flat, no wall is straight. Take a bath in one of the three healing mineral springs or sweat away in one of the 11 saunas.\n\nWant to see one of the locals' favorite baths? Then visit Bad Radkersburg, where you can soak in 93 to 96 degrees of warm thermal water and let the water nozzles massage your body. The bath is located in a gigantic park, where you can wander around in your bathrobe and stay connected back home with free WiFi. Tip: Try the wine cellar sauna. The smell of grapes will make sweating enjoyable.\n\nThe thermal water is said to have positive impact on your health. (Photo: Rogner Bad Blumau)\n\nIf you prefer something more intimate, give Bad Gleichenberg a try. The water is called \u201cbath of tranquility\u201d and that's exactly the vibe you'll get from it. It's one of the smaller baths in Styria, which makes it cozy. Take a swim in the lovely outdoor pool, framed with roses and trees or let your mind wander off to the relaxing sounds of the bio-sauna.\n\nRelaxing this hard can make you hungry. And here's where the second (and crucial) part of the experience comes in: the food and wine. Visit a Buschenschank, akin to a diner, where they serve snacks that include a variety of delicious sausages, cold meat, cheese and vegetables. All washed down with a fine local wine, of course.\n\nStyria only produces 7% of Austrian wine, but this little region is considered one of the best in the country for wine grapes. It is famous for white wine, especially crisp or intense varieties such as Welschriesling (riesling), Weissburgunder (white burgundy) and Morillon (Chardonnay).\n\nBeautiful view over the Styrian grape wine hills. (Photo: Gruendl)\n\nA 10-minute drive will get you from Bad Gleichenberg to the Genussgut Krispel, a place that's famous for \u201cwool pig\u201d cold meat (made from a special pig breed). Get a plate of different variations like salami or bacon, topped with fresh vegetables and enjoy a glass of Sauvignon Blanc with that. The modern architecture and lovely garden make this place unique. Ask the staff for wine recommendations.\n\nUp for a little drive? Visit the winery Gruendl in Labuttendorf, half an hour away from Bad Radkersburg. Enjoy the award-winning wines made by Stefan, the young vintner of the family-owned business. You should also treat yourself to a \u201chouse plate\u201d filled with all the good snacks this estate has to offer. Tip: Also ask for the desert specials made by Mama Gruendl.\n\nIf you're not in a hurry, take a little detour to the small town of Siebing and visit the List winery. No food but tons of incredible wines you can take home with you. Vintner Matthias will guide you through his selection.\n\nSouthern Styria is also famous for its picturesque landscape \u2013 small hills covered with grape vines. Take the scenic road along the South Styrian wine street and pull into the Adam Schererkogl winery. In the summer you can order a plate of local snacks and wine at the counter and take it up a hill next to the winery. You will be rewarded with one of the best views in the area.\n\nFollow the Styrian path, and you soon will learn the fabulous way to eat, drink and relax.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2018/11/19/styria-austria-tourist-spot-shows-visitors-how-relax/1710016002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Learn the secret art of relaxing in Styria, Austria", "description": "Learn the secret art of relaxing in Styria, Austria", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/destinations/2018/11/19/learn-secret-art-relaxing-styria-austria/2055222002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/3590a414-e452-41da-a3ac-cbacc1c84e2c-1.jpg?crop=599,337,x1,y263&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:46:14Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nThe thermal water is said to have positive impact on your health.

(Photo: Marc Lester /Anchorage Daily News via AP)\n\nCrime imposes substantial fiscal and social costs on the United States. In 2016, more than 1.4 percent of our Nation\u2019s GDP was spent funding the State and Federal criminal justice system. Victims and society at large also bear significant costs through pain, suffering, reduced quality of life, property losses, increased medical costs, and loss of life. The most recent estimates from 2014 indicate that altogether these damages constitute an additional 1.5 percent of GDP, yielding a total burden of 2.9 percent of GDP, or roughly $500 billion.\n\nThese costs can be attributed, in part, to crimes committed by prisoners after already serving once in prison, through recidivism after being released from state and federal facilities. If recent trends hold, almost half of federal inmates who were conditionally released will be re-arrested within 5 years of release and more than 75 percent of state offenders who were released on community supervision will be re-arrested within 5 years of release.\n\nThe president is reducing spending, crime\n\nTo break this cycle, President Donald J. Trump is working to effect bipartisan and evidence-based prison reforms to reduce recidivism. He issued an executive order in March that is bringing together more than a dozen Federal agencies to identify ways to reduce recidivism, enhance the reentry process, and improve public safety.\n\nThe administration also worked with Congress to draft the FIRST STEP Act, legislation which seeks to strengthen recidivism reduction and evidence-based reentry programs for inmates in federal prisons. We continue to work with the law enforcement and faith and business communities to find ways to get people leaving prison properly reintegrated into society.\n\nWhile these reforms have proven to reduce crime, they also lead to reductions in the costs associated with corrections operations in general. The most damning fact about the ineffectiveness of our current prison system is that only 24 percent of the current federal prison population is being incarcerated for the first time. By lowering the rate of recidivism, we can apply a broad-based approach to preventing future crimes and cutting prison costs over time.\n\nMore: Lame-duck Congress' rush for criminal justice reform plan will hurt, not help: Tom Cotton\n\nMidterms show that voters are ready for criminal justice reform.

As the president said at the White House Prison Reform Summit in May, one of the most important things we can do is to create a great economy and a good work environment for all Americans, including former prisoners. Thanks in part to the administration\u2019s pro-growth policies, the economy is booming and the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in nearly 50 years. To continue this strong trend of economic growth, we need a capable workforce to fill available jobs. In 2014, around 6 percent of working-age males had been incarcerated at some point in their lives. However, a study found that the unemployment rate among them is 27 percent, which is close to the general unemployment rate around the Depression. It is paramount that we help prisoners who are motivated to live law-abiding lives become more employable so that they can contribute to society after they are released.\n\nInvesting in prisons benefits the American public\n\nA recent analysis from the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) found that certain prison programs not only reduce crime, but also lower overall prison spending by reducing the costs associated with prison reentry. CEA estimates that mental health or substance abuse treatment may reduce the burden of crime and long-term incarceration costs by up to $5 for every $1 invested by taxpayers. Further, those who return to use of illegal drugs after prison are at risk of a fatal overdose due to the presence of fentanyl and other dangerous synthetic opioids in our drug supply. CEA also found great variation in effectiveness across programs, which suggests reallocating spending from poorly performing programs to higher performing ones could cut recidivism and taxpayer spending at the same time.\n\nDespite these positive returns, there are many programs, such as in education, where the evidence is less conclusive and merits further exploration. There is some evidence to suggest that more educated prisoners are less likely to become recidivists. For example, those who have not completed high school have a 60 percent chance of re-incarceration, while college graduates have a 19 percent chance.\n\nGovernment investment in prison education can be viewed as an extension of existing public investments \u2014 much like public investment for higher income populations through publicly financed schools, universities, and student loans \u2014 that build human capital elsewhere in our economy.\n\nThe bipartisan reforms supported by the president are an important broad-based approach that will, hopefully, benefit not only prisoners, but also the American public. This White House recognizes that fiscal and human costs of criminal activity are unacceptably high. Through our efforts to break the cycle of crime and reduce recidivism, we can assist more people to contribute to our society rather than be a burden to our great country.\n\nJared Kushner is a senior advisor to the president, and Tomas J.

It\u2019s why all-pro punter Johnny Hekker, who raised money and delivered relief supplies for victims of wild fires last year, visited with first responders last week. It\u2019s why several Rams players recorded video messages for a fundraising drive that the team, two local TV stations and the United Way collaborated with to raise more than $1.17 million for relief efforts. A handful of former Rams, including Eric Dickerson and Jackie Slater, joined Rams cheerleaders to man telephones. It\u2019s why the Rams, expecting perhaps 70,000 on Monday, have given thousands of tickets to first responders.\n\nAnd it\u2019s why Demoff says that one of the greatest lessons he\u2019s learned over the past two weeks revolves around the heart of the people throughout his organization. In crisis, you tend to learn a lot about people with how they respond.\n\nWhile the games go on. As much as they want to beat the Chiefs, though, there\u2019s a greater purpose.\n\n\u201cYou want the game to have importance and meaning to it,\u201d Demoff said.\n\nSure, we\u2019ve heard it before. If a football game can provide a brief respite that allows people a temporary break from the real-life issues, it is a good thing. Demoff won\u2019t dispute that, but quickly adds another layer of context.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we can help,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a microcosm of what you\u2019re seeing throughout Southern California, with so many people coming to the aid of others. We\u2019re fortunate to be able to play a role.\u201d\n\nStaging a game, with such short notice, is no easy venture. While the NFL mandates that for international games, the designated home team must have its stadium available as a contingency, that\u2019s never been put into practice until now. After the NFL pulled out of the game in Mexico City on Tuesday, the first item on Rams\u2019 checklist was to get clearance from Southern Cal to waive the condition in the team\u2019s lease that prohibits night games on school nights.\n\nThen it was a matter of lining up security, police, concessions personnel and hotels. There was no time to print tickets, so every seat is assigned as an e-ticket. Parking will be on a first-come, first-serve basis, with no printed parking passes. And without the capability to use scanners in the lots, the parking will be handled on a cash basis.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 business operations staff, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t had an office for more than a week. The team\u2019 business headquarters, in Agoura Hills, is in the evacuation zone. While the structure is intact, there\u2019s extensive smoke damage, forcing the business staff to work from their homes or other locations.\n\nMcVay\u2019s team spent the week practicing at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., which was the original plan to help the team prepare for the thin altitude of Mexico City. The Rams stuck with the plan after the game site was switched, with an alteration added: Rams owner Stan Kroenke chartered a second airplane to transport family members of the players to Colorado, preventing separation of families.\n\nSuch adjustments have become part of the deal for the Rams. The day the fires began in Ventura County, McVay canceled practice to allow players to tend to their families. Some players and staff members had to evacuate. Before their home game against the Seahawks last week, the Rams secured the hotel the team uses before home games a day earlier for players and staff.\n\nNever mind the notion that disruptions to the typical NFL routine is some sort of distraction for the Rams. It can\u2019t be an excuse. Not here. Not now. Although the game can provide a sense of normalcy \u2013 for players and fans alike -- it\u2019s bigger than football.\n\n\u201cThe main thing you want to do,\u201d Demoff said, \u201cis show your best.\u201d\n\nWinning with a best effort on Monday night wouldn\u2019t hurt civic pride.\n\nAfter all, the Rams are without question an L.A. team now."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Adam Woodard, USA TODAY", "title": "Bengals' Marvin Lewis after being gashed by Ravens' Lamar Jackson: 'Quarterbacks don't run forever'", "description": "Bengals coach Marvin Lewis critiques Ravens' QB Lamar Jackson after the rookie rushed for 117 yards in his first NFL start.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/19/ravens-lamar-jackson-bengals-marvin-lewis/2054229002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/218acbf8-5548-4e7b-a66c-3c53e228aebb-USATSI_11693974.jpg?crop=3713,2089,x1,y101&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:33:42Z", "content": "Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson rushes during the fourth quarter against the Cincinnati Bengals at M&amp;T Bank Stadium.

(Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIn his first NFL start, Ravens rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson torched the Bengals defense in Baltimore\u2019s 24-21 win.\n\nPlaying to his strengths, the former Heisman trophy winner at Louisville set a team record with 117 rushing yards. Jackson\u2019s 27 rushing attempts were the most rushes by a quarterback in the Super Bowl era and his 117 yards were the most by a quarterback in four years, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nAfter the game, Bengals coach Marvin Lewis had this to say about Jackson: \"Quarterbacks don't run forever in the NFL. Sooner or later, they get hurt, and they don't run the same. But, today, he could run, and he did a good job.\"\n\nTell us how you really feel, coach.\n\nFilling in for Joe Flacco, who was sidelined with a hip injury, Jackson completed 13-of-19 passes for 150 yards, one interception and zero touchdowns. He led the team in rushing, followed by Gus Edwards, who ran for 115 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries.\n\nWith 256 yards on 55 attempts, Jackson is the team's leading rusher this season behind Alex Collins (411 yards on 114 attempts).\n\nRavens coach John Harbaugh said he doesn\u2019t believe Jackson will run the ball as much in future games, saying, \u201cI think that's what Lamar felt that it took today.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it's going to take that many carries every week. It's not what we're going to be shooting for, by any stretch,\u201d said Harbaugh. \u201cBut, if it takes that many, Lamar will do it.\u201d\n\nThe win moved the Ravens (5-5) into second place in the AFC North, keeping their playoff hopes alive.\n\nFour of Baltimore\u2019s six remaining opponents rank 21st-or-worse in the NFL in run defense: Oakland (31st), Atlanta (21st), Kansas City (22nd) and Cleveland (28th).\n\nWhile Harbaugh doesn\u2019t see Jackson running as much down the stretch, Ravens safety Eric Weddle hopes the young quarterback doesn\u2019t stray from what he does best.\n\n\"I think that's who Lamar is when you drafted him,\" said Weddle. \"Why all of a sudden do you want to change what he does best? Look at what he did today. It was crazy, pretty amazing. He's only going to get better throwing the ball.

(AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Coming off their best offensive performance of the season \u2014 and an extra week of rest \u2014 the Buffalo Bills have their starting quarterback back.\n\nJosh Allen will make his return against the Jacksonville Jaguars, coach Sean McDermott said on Monday.\n\nAllen was a full participant on the practice field as the Bills returned from the Week 11 bye with a shortened 45-minute session.\n\n\"I'm excited,\" Allen said. \"I'm thankful for the opportunity.\"\n\nAllen missed four games after suffering an elbow injury in Buffalo's Week 6 loss to the Houston Texans. The first-round pick returned to the practice field prior to the team's bye week, but did not play in Week 10 against the New York Jets.\n\nThe Bills have maintained that Allen, chosen seventh overall last spring, would return to the lineup when healthy \u2014 but that decision was not necessarily an easy one for the Bills.\n\nMatt Barkley started for Buffalo against the Jets and provided the team with its best performance under center this season, throwing for 232 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions in a 41-10 win.\n\n\"You look at everything,\" McDermott said. \"That's part of my job, my responsibility is to do that. (General manager) Brandon (Beane) and I spoke about it. We certainly were impressed with the way Matt handled things, but at the end of the day Josh is our starter and we're excited to have him back.\"\n\nAllen wore a black sleeve on his right arm at practice on Monday, which he said he could wear in games moving forward. He remained in Buffalo to rehabilitate his injury during the team's bye and felt the extra time off was significant in his recovery.\n\n\"The difference that I feel in the elbow right now compared to two weeks ago is a very big difference,\" Allen said. \"I'm thankful that I was able to sit out for one more week. ... I'm making throws where I don't have to second-guess, putting the ball where it needs to be. And when I'm making the throws there's no grabbing or pulling in there and it feels fluid.\"\n\nAllen's return is just the latest change for Buffalo's last-ranked passing attack. The Bills have made several moves in recent weeks with an emphasis on adding speed and youth at wide receiver, which paid off against the Jets.\n\nDeonte Thompson was signed during the team's bye week. Thompson came out of nowhere to earn a significant role on offense last season, making 27 receptions for 430 yards and a touchdown. He signed with Dallas this offseason as a free agent and was released by the Cowboys on Nov. 9.\n\n\"Things weren't working out over there,\" Thompson said. \"It's a great opportunity for me to come back here and get on the field and make some plays. ... Coming back here was a no-brainer for me.\"\n\nThompson's signing comes after a breakout performance by undrafted rookie Robert Foster. With three catches for 105 yards against the Jets, Foster became the first Bills receiver to top 100 yards in more than a year \u2014 since Thompson's 107 yards on Oct. 22, 2017.\n\n\"Brandon and I talked a couple weeks ago and we thought we were lacking in the speed department on offense so that's been an emphasis the last couple of weeks,\" McDermott said. \"You saw some of that up against the Jets. That just opens things up a little bit.\"\n\nThe early returns on Allen have been mixed so far in Buffalo. The QB has shown flashes with his strong arm and mobility, but he has been largely inconsistent as a passer. In six games, Allen has thrown for 832 yards, two touchdowns and five interceptions.\n\n\"I've been saying it \u2014 I think we're close,\" Allen said. \"We went out and we executed very well against a good Jets defense. ... That just speaks volumes to the guys that we have in this locker room.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Oct 10) AP\n\nTaylor Swift (Photo: VALERIE MACON, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTaylor Swift has a new record deal \u2013 and she's using it to lobby for higher paydays for her new labelmates.\n\nSwift announced on Instagram Monday that she signed a multi-year agreement with Universal Music Group and its subsidiary Republic Records, joining artists including Drake, Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande on Republic's roster.\n\nConsidering she's one of the most powerful names in music, Swift came away from the deal \u2013 the financial details of which are undisclosed \u2013 with some major benefits. She shared with her Instagram followers that under her new contract she owns her master recordings for the music she makes with UMG.\n\n\"It's also incredibly exciting to know that I'll own all of my master recordings that I make from now on,\" she wrote.\n\nSwift also shared that as part of her new deal she asked for \"one condition\" aimed at ensuring that artists are compensated fairly for their Spotify presence. The deal states UMG's sales of its Spotify shares will result in money distributed to the label's artists, a point of the deal that Swift noted \"meant more to me than any other deal point.\"\n\n\"As part of my new contract with Universal Music Group, I asked that any sale of their Spotify shares result in a distribution of money to their artists, non-recoupable,\" she wrote. \"They have generously agreed to this, at what they believe will be much better terms than paid out previously by other major labels. I see this as a sign that we are headed towards positive changes for creators \u2013 a goal I'm never going to stop trying to help achieve, in whatever ways I can.\"\n\nSwift's agreement with UMG formalizes the company's commitment to sharing the wealth with its artists. Music Business Worldwide estimates UMG's Spotify shares are worth around $850 million. Earlier this year, a UMG spokesperson told Music Business Worldwide that the company would share some of its proceeds with artists in the case of a Spotify equity sale.\n\nThis isn't the first time Swift has gone to bat for artists against streaming services. She previously pulled her albums from Apple Music in 2015 to protest Apple's decision to forego paying artists during a free three-month trial of the service.\n\nShortly after, Apple Music announced that the policy would be eliminated, and Swift's music returned to the streaming service.\n\nIn a release, UMG Chairman/CEO Sir Lucian Grainge celebrated Swift's new deal.\n\n\u201cFew artists in history approach Taylor Swift\u2019s combination of massive global hits and creative brilliance,\" he wrote. \"She is so multi-talented, she can achieve anything. I have such enormous respect for Taylor, in particular for her use of her hard-earned influence to promote positive change.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/19/taylor-swift-signs-new-record-deal-lobbies-higher-pay-others/2054412002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Brian Bowen sues Adidas, associates over corruption scandal", "description": "Former Louisville and South Carolina player Brian Bowen II has sued Adidas and several of its associates alleging federal racketeering violations", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/19/brian-bowen-sues-adidas-associates-over-corruption-scandal/38563677/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:19:21Z", "content": "Former Louisville and South Carolina play Brian Bowen II has sued Adidas and several associates caught up in the college basketball corruption scandal alleging federal racketing violations that cost him the chance to develop his game.

It is now time for them to answer for what they have done and to suffer the consequences of their corporate misconduct,\" attorney Mullin McLeod said.\n\nAdidas did not immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nThe suit also names Adidas associates James Gatto, Merl Code, Christian Dawkins, Munish Sood, Thomas Gassnola and Christopher Rivers. Gatto, Code and Dawkins were found guilty last month in a federal trial.\n\nSood and Gassnola were witnesses at the trial after pleading guilty.\n\nBowen's attorney Mullins McLeod said Adidas should answer for their misconduct. The company \"has thus far infiltrated college basketball with complete impunity,\" he said.\n\nIt was alleged the scheme involved giving Bowen's father $100,000 to have his son play for Louisville.\n\nThe younger Bowen enrolled at Louisville in the fall of 2017, but never played a game. He transferred to South Carolina for the spring semester and left in May when it became apparent the NCAA would keep him from playing for longer than Bowen hoped.\n\nBowen took part in the NBA's Draft Combine last spring and is playing professionally in Australia.\n\nHe has denied any wrongdoing and knowledge of his father's plans.\n\n\"I have always felt that Brian was the true victim of everything that transpired with Adidas,\" said attorney Jason A.

(David Santiago/Miami Herald via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDAVIE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Ryan Tannehill is throwing the ball 50 yards in side sessions, and the Miami Dolphins would love to see those passes in a game.\n\nMaybe this week.\n\nTannehill made progress during the team's bye week in his rehabilitation from a throwing shoulder injury, and remains on schedule to meet his goal of returning Sunday at Indianapolis.\n\nThere are significant hurdles yet to be cleared. Coach Adam Gase said Monday he didn't even know whether Tannehill will participate fully in practice this week, but sounded upbeat about his quarterback's recent progress.\n\n\"I feel like it is forever since I've seen him throw,\" Gase said. \"To me he looks like what he once looked like.\"\n\nBrock Osweiler has gone 2-3 starting for Tannehill. The injury-plagued Dolphins are 5-5 and tied for sixth place in the AFC with the Colts and three other teams.\n\nThe Dolphins' eagerness to get Tannehill back in the lineup is magnified because their offense has gone nine quarters without a touchdown. Osweiler's most recent scoring pass came four games ago.\n\nTannehill has said he's resigned to throwing with pain the rest of the year because of an injury to his shoulder capsule in Week 5. He's now targeting receivers on the move, but his shoulder stamina remains a concern and needs to be tested by the intensity of practice, Gase said.\n\n\"He can throw it down the field now,\" Gase said. \"It looks good. It's just all about how many times.\"\n\nGase is wary of a setback and said he wants to decide soon on a starter for Sunday.\n\n\"I'm running out of time,\" he said. \"We can't be wrong and start the week one way, and then flip when we get to Friday.\"\n\nMiami's first practice of the week \u2014 and first since Nov. 9 \u2014 will be Tuesday.\n\nWhile Tannehill's progress was encouraging, the Dolphins took another hit on the health front when they decided to place receiver-returner Jakeem Grant on injured reserve with a lower leg injury that required surgery. Grant ranks second in the NFL in both kickoff returns and punt returns.\n\nHe was hurt in the loss at Green Bay a week ago, and initially the team hoped he might return this year. Miami lost another dynamic receiver, Albert Wilson, to a season-ending hip injury in Week 7.\n\nReceiver DeVante Parker might return this week from a shoulder injury, Gase said. He said the status this week of starting offensive tackles Laremy Tunsil (knee) and Ja'Wuan James (knee) was uncertain. Cornerback Bobby McCain remained in the concussion protocol.\n\nThe AFC race tightened Sunday with the Dolphins idle. They have a chance to make the playoffs for only the third time in the past 17 seasons even though they've been outgained by 787 yards and outscored by 57 points.\n\n\"It's who can have the best six-game season,\" Gase said. \"To give ourselves a chance in December to create our own destiny \u2014 that's what we wanted when we started this thing.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, tracks two other court actions, arguing that Whitaker lacks the Senate confirmation required of all Cabinet officials.\n\nThe senators' filing in a District of Columbia federal court contends that President Donald Trump's appointment was unconstitutional.\n\n\"The U.S. Senate has not consented to Mr. Whitaker serving in any office within the federal government, let alone the highest office of the (Justice Department),\" the senators' lawsuit argues. \"Indeed, if allowed to stand, Mr. Whitaker's appointment would create a road map for the evasion of the constitutionally prescribed Senate advice-and-consent role.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, Whitehouse referred to Whitaker as \"an unconfirmed lackey\" who posed a threat to the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, led by Justice special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nBefore joining the Justice Department last year as chief of staff to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Whitaker was publicly critical of Mueller's inquiry and once raised the prospect of cutting off funding for the investigation.\n\n\"Unless the courts intercede, this troubling move creates a plain road map for persistent and deliberate evasion by the executive branch of the Senate's constitutionally mandated advice and consent,\" Whitehouse said. \"Indeed, this appointment appears planned to accomplish that goal.\u201d\n\nLast week, separate legal challenges were filed in Maryland and at the Supreme Court.\n\nVeteran Supreme Court litigator Thomas Goldstein asked the justices Friday to decide whether Whitaker was legally installed as the temporary successor to Sessions, who Trump ousted nearly two weeks ago.\n\nThe ultimate goal of all three challenges is the same: a federal court ruling declaring that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the legal and constitutional heir to Sessions.\n\nJustice officials defended Whitaker's appointment last week, issuing a 20-page opinion asserting that Whitaker\u2019s standing as a senior department executive \u201cunquestionably\u201d authorized the president to elevate the former Iowa federal prosecutor.\n\nJustice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel based its findings on provisions of the Vacancies Reform Act, which allows for the appointment of a senior staffer who has been in office for at least 90 days.\n\nBeyond the arguments over Whitaker's authority, Democrats and some Republicans seized on Whitaker's criticism of Mueller's inquiry and called for his recusal from overseeing the investigation.\n\nMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh filed his challenge in federal district court in Maryland last week, calling Whitaker's appointment \"illegal and unconstitutional.\" The case is scheduled to be heard Dec. 19 but could take months before reaching the Supreme Court.\n\nGoldstein's effort is aimed at leapfrogging lower courts and getting the justices to decide who Sessions' replacement should be, perhaps within weeks.\n\nMore: Supreme Court asked to rule on Trump's choice of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general\n\nMore: Matthew Whitaker isn't acting like just a caretaker as interim attorney general\n\nMore: Democrats to investigate Matthew Whitaker's role with company that allegedly bilked customers of millions\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/19/senate-democrats-matthew-whitaker/2054188002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Gene Sloan, USA TODAY", "title": "Cruise lines get a jump on Black Friday, Cyber Monday with pre-Thanksgiving deals", "description": "Cruise lines such as Cunard, Emerald and Scenic have begun rolling out Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals.

The project will create a single terminal to replace the three horseshoe-style buildings at Kansas City's main airport.\n\nMayor Sly James said the dispute is over how the airlines will split costs and that the airlines themselves must work through it. James says the city will \"push forward\" with the project.\n\n\"We will insist, however, that this resolution of their internal dispute be reasonable and fair and in no way diminish the flight or service options for our flying public,\" James said. \"We're not going to allow this project, which is so important to this city, to be the platform for resolution of national issues and disputes between large and small airline carriers.\"\n\nHe said the dispute includes how to pay for a $20 million baggage claim system.\n\nAirlines are still negotiating the agreement and it is unclear what the airlines have proposed for splitting the costs.\n\nSpirit and Allegiant executives both said in their letters that the city needs an upgraded airport.\n\n\"However, we believe the current investment proposal is simply ... too costly for smaller new entrant carriers to bear and still deliver the value that we deliver to the community in terms of low airfares,\" Spirit executive Matt Klein said.\n\nAllegiant's vice president of airports and government affairs, Keith Hansen, said that larger airlines were expecting smaller airlines to shoulder an unreasonably large portion of the costs of operating the airport.\n\n\"Given that the terms for the new airport rates and charges agreement remain unknown and considering the larger carriers continue to reject equitable cost allocation, Allegiant cannot support the terminal development program at this time,\" Hansen said.\n\nInformation from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.com\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2018/11/19/spirit-airlines-allegiant-protest-price-kansas-city-airport-plan/2054175002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, David Jackson, USA TODAY", "title": "President Trump to campaign for Cindy Hyde-Smith in Mississippi runoff", "description": "Trump has conducted more than 40 such rallies over the course of this election year.

And music has Milli Vanilli.\n\nBut 40 years later, the bad idea to end all bad ideas remains \"The Star Wars Holiday Special,\" a TV movie/variety-show hybrid that pairs the cast of the world\u2019s most popular sci-fi film with Beatrice Arthur and The Jefferson Starship. The special was dubbed one of TV's most embarrassing failures, and \u201cthe worst atrocity ever committed to (the \"Star Wars\") fantasy universe,\u201d wrote David Hofstede in his 2004 book \"What Were They Thinking? The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History.\" \u2013 \u201cworse than Jar-Jar.\u201d\n\nLow praise, indeed.\n\nCommissioned by CBS to cash in on the still-popular 1977 blockbuster, and envisioned by producer-director George Lucas as a way to keep the \"Star Wars\" brand alive between installments, \"Holiday Special\" mixes big-screen mythology with small-screen hokum as it shifts the focus to Han Solo\u2019s hairy sidekick Chewbacca and his attempt to get back home in time for his planet\u2019s annual Life Day celebration.\n\nMore: Disney details new 'Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge' attractions, including music by John Williams\n\nMore: 'Star Wars: Rogue One' spinoff series lands on Disney's new streaming service\n\nTwin stories spotlight the furry creature speeding through space aboard the Millennium Falcon, aided by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and pursued by Imperial forces, as his family anxiously awaits his arrival at home, among them wife Malla, son Lumpy, and elderly father Itchy. Yes, Itchy.\n\nThat none of the grunting Wookies at the heart of the tale offer anything by way of discernible dialogue is merely a fraction of its interest as a curiosity. The whole is more difficult to describe: Preceded by an overheated voiceover that introduced the cast (\u201cStarring ... R2D2 as R2D2!...\u201d), it amounts to a two-hour mash-up of repurposed \"Star Wars\" footage and new scenes with Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher (who look mortified throughout), along with an original \"Star Wars\" cartoon and a handful of musical and comedy sequences clumsily inserted to pad out the special and match the 1970s-era variety-show template.\n\nHarvey Korman as Krelman and Bea Arthur as Ackmena in 1978's 'Star Wars Holiday Special.\" (Photo: CBS Photo Archive, CBS via Getty Images)\n\nThese latter elements appear incongruously, courtesy of futuristic home-entertainment devices found in the Wookie treehouse (evidently constructed of scraps from the H.R. Pufnstuf lumber yard). Thus, Harvey Korman pops up as an eight-armed Julia Child-inspired TV-chef whom Malla watches cooking; singer Diahann Carroll is conjured up courtesy of Grandpa Itchy\u2019s dip into virtual reality; and miniature Cirque du Soleil-style acrobats come to holographic life as son Lumpy demonstrates his gaming console.\n\nIn addition, Art Carney, who'd recently won an Oscar for \"Harry and Tonto,\" appears as a Wookie-planet \u201clocal trader, friend of the rebellion, and a member of the alliance\u201d who unveils a video device that leads into a performance from the Starship. And in what became the special\u2019s most-head-shaking sequence, Beatrice Arthur, who'd just wrapped up her six-year run on the CBS sitcom \"Maude,\" shows up as a singing cantina bartender in a film-within-a-film sequence about life on Tatooine.\n\nAt which point it\u2019s fairly easy to believe veteran writer Bruce Vilanch\u2019s claim, years later, that he was heavily into cocaine while working on the project. (Vilanch is one of five credited writers, each accomplished at the time, for TV specials starring Olivia Newton-John, Barry Manilow and Lily Tomlin.) And concluding with a group-hug finale in which Fisher, as Princess Leia, sings a Life Day anthem, the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\" is a bizarre trip. (Spoiler alert: Chewie makes it home in time.)\n\nIn fairness, a Hollywood Reporter review called the project both \u201cinventive\u201d and \u201ca welcome surprise.\u201d And the special did mark both the first appearance of future \"Star Wars\" mainstay Boba Fett and the first acknowledgment of James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. It also teased 1978 audiences with glimpses of futuristic technology that proved prescient, from virtual-reality devices to videophones. And in large part, its badness has been mythologized through the decades, remembered through the lens of more sophisticated programming and through the eyes of indignant defenders of the \"Star Wars\" legend.\n\nStill: the special is a bad idea, badly executed, with scene after scene of Wookies grunting dialogue to one another, with the humans around them serving as default translators (\u201cChewbacca isn\u2019t there yet, you say?\u201d); lame attempts at physical shtick, including one scene that finds Carney doing an homage to his Ed Norton \"Honeymooners\" role; and Saturday-morning TV-level special effects.

By the end of the call, according to four separate accounts of people present for the conversation, Altman told James the trade would not occur. Minutes later, on Aug. 22, 2017, word broke that the Cavs agreed in principle to send Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and Brooklyn\u2019s 2018 first-round pick. James\u2019 close friend, Randy Mims, and bodyguard Rob Brown came to him with their phones to show him the news. James, who was still signing jerseys, dropped the pen and slumped in his chair. \u2026 James suggested he didn\u2019t feel he was lied to by Altman, so much as Altman was overruled by owner Dan Gilbert. \u201cYou realize at that point in time, take nothing from Koby, because Koby (was just named GM), but at that point in time, you realize that Koby\u2019s not the only one running the team, as (former GM David Griffin) had done, and that\u2019s why Griff was let go pretty much,\u201d James said.\n\nWe know that James\u2019 relationship with Gilbert was icy to say the least, particularly after the now-infamous scathing letter written in Comic Sans font after James bolted for Miami years ago.\n\nBut we also know that James was a year away from making another free-agent decision, and that\u2019s where the Cavs\u2019 front office\u2019s response is key:\n\nCavs front-office officials declined to be quoted for this story but disputed that Altman gave James any indication the trade would not occur. They also said Altman asked James whether he would commit to the Cavs long-term if Irving were not traded, and James said no.\n\nIn other words, it was a complicated situation for Cleveland\u2019s brass: If James did indeed want the team to keep Irving but he had the potential to leave, what should the Cavaliers done? Start a rebuild or hope James would decide to stay? Then you have to factor in reports that Irving was unhappy at the time \u2014 The Athletic story mentions he \u201ctold the Cavs he wanted out so badly he\u2019d go ahead with knee surgery and miss a large portion of the year.\u201d\n\nThey chose to kick-start the rebuild, and here we are over a year later.

From 2000 to 2016, the United States granted asylum to an average of 26,651 foreigners a year, according to Department of Homeland Security data.\n\nThe number of asylum applications has skyrocketed in recent years, from 5,000 in 2008 to 97,000 in 2018, mostly fueled by Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries.\n\nThat increase is partly what prompted the administration to implement two big changes that are now being challenged in Monday's court hearings.\n\nThe first hearing took place in Washington, D.C., where the ACLU and other groups filed a challenge to the administration\u2019s efforts to narrow the grounds that migrants can use to qualify for asylum.\n\nIn June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new policy asserting that victims of domestic abuse and gang violence would no longer qualify for asylum. The lawsuit claims the administration sidestepped U.S. law and implemented its own standards, distorting the asylum process \"beyond recognition.\"\n\nThe second hearing took place in San Francisco, where the ACLU and other groups filed a challenge to the administration\u2019s efforts to limit the process migrants can use to put in their asylum claims.\n\nUp until Nov. 9, migrants could request asylum either by presenting themselves at a port of entry or entering the country illegally and then requesting asylum.\n\nThe 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act states that any foreigner who arrives in the USA, \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival,\" may apply for asylum. A United Nations treaty signed in 1951 by the United States says \"refugees should not be penalized for their illegal entry\" because extreme situations sometimes \"require refugees to breach immigration rules.\"\n\nBut on Nov. 9, Trump tried to overrule those rules, signing a presidential proclamation ending the ability of migrants to request asylum if they enter the country illegally. The administration is relying on the same legal rational it use to implement its controversial travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries \u2014 a section of U.S. law that allows a president to suspend entry of foreigners if deems them \"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"\n\nThe first two versions of the travel ban were shot down in court, but the third was upheld by the Supreme Court. The administration believes that decision gives it the authorization it needs to use that statute more broadly, including in its effort to limit asylum.\n\nNeither judge issued a ruling from the bench, but could issue their opinions any time. Their options include upholding Trump's restrictions, which would likely draw an appeal from the ACLU, or ordering a preliminary injunction blocking Trump's rule changes and allowing migrants to continue applying for asylum, which would likely draw an appeal from the Department of Justice.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/19/donald-trump-asylum-policy-migrant-caravan-mexico-honduras-border-security-immigration-tijuana/2053056002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Gabe Lacques, USA TODAY", "title": "Bryce Harper: Why the Chicago White Sox should sign free agent", "description": "The White Sox\u2019s once-reluctant teardown has gone in fits and starts, but adding Harper could turn things on its head.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2018/11/19/bryce-harper-free-agent-white-sox/2053968002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/9c577b71-301a-4dc9-89dd-a161b7ae0a57-111918-harper-caps-illo-whitesox.jpg?crop=3322,1869,x1,y970&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:19:38Z", "content": "Harper's free agency is the big topic of MLB's offseason.

(Photo: USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBryce Harper, a National League MVP at 23, is a free agent at 26, peddling his services in an industry that\u2019s grown to nearly $11 billion in annual revenues. His combination of skills, age and marketing cachet make him an excellent fit for any major league franchise.\n\nIncluding the Chicago White Sox.\n\nHarper, who has 184 career home runs and a lifetime .900 OPS, rejected a 10-year, $300 million contract offer from the Washington Nationals in September, and is a good bet to set a new standard for the most lucrative contract in North American sports history.\n\nIt may take weeks for that process to play out. In the meantime, USA TODAY Sports will examine why every team could use Harper\u2019s services \u2013 some more than others, certainly some better-equipped to procure them.\n\nA case for Harper and the White Sox joining forces:\n\nOn the field\n\nThis would be so simple: Sign Harper, roll him out in right field and let the franchise coalesce around him. The White Sox have been peddling incumbent right fielder Avisail Garcia and may be inclined to simply non-tender the 2019 free agent if they can\u2019t find a taker.\n\nWaiting for the kids on the farm to blossom will be the intriguing part.\n\nThe White Sox\u2019s once-reluctant teardown has gone in fits and starts, and a 100-loss season in 2018 saw its share of low points: Yoan Moncada\u2019s AL-leading 217 strikeouts, Michael Kopech\u2019s Tommy John surgery, shortstop Tim Anderson\u2019s aversion to getting on base.\n\nA second wave of prospects is about to hit, however.\n\nLeading the way is outfielder Eloy Jimenez, who is primed for a late-April debut once the White Sox have sufficiently robbed him of a year of service time. He was ready to roll by the end of last year, when he produced 22 homers and a .961 OPS in 108 games at Class AA and AAA.\n\nCuban signee Luis Robert is probably a year behind Jimenez but dazzled in a brief Arizona Fall League appearance and has the goods to hold down center field in Chicago. Nick Madrigal, the fourth overall pick in the 2018 draft, is poised to become a fixture at second base for the next decade. And the White Sox will add the third overall pick in 2019 to this mix.\n\nNaturally, there will be growing pains with this group. Yet dropping Harper into the middle of the lineup would alleviate pressure on all of them \u2013 and perhaps give holdovers like Moncada and Anderson a chance to catch their breath and take the final steps in development.\n\nShould most of the position players pan out, that would afford the White Sox significant cost savings to apply toward pitching if need be. Even still, Kopech should be ready to roll by 2020, with fellow right-handers Dylan Cease and Dane Dunning knocking on the door in the high minors.\n\nMeanwhile, Harper could age gracefully at Guaranteed Rate Field, with the option to serve as designated hitter in the latter years of his deal.\n\nOff the field\n\nSigning a big-bucks free agent still in his prime would be a new experience for the White Sox, who certainly do not skimp on bronze: 11 statues of franchise legends dot the Guaranteed Rate Field grounds. Most are native White Sox (such as Luis Aparicio, Frank Thomas, Harold Baines) or came into their own on the South Side (Nellie Fox, Paul Konerko).\n\nHarper would be joining Carlton Fisk as a potential Hall of Famer shifting gears mid-career. But nine of Fisk\u2019s 11 All-Star Game nods came as Red Sox.\n\nHarper conceivably has many of his best years ahead of him and would give perpetually star-crossed White Sox fans someone to believe in.\n\nIs it hard to imagine his hair flips playing among the South Side denizens? Not really. Put Harper in the silver and black and make him the heel-turning alternative to his blue-eyed pal on the other end of the Red Line.\n\nIndeed, the pregame bro hugs would be ample should Harper and Kris Bryant square off a half-dozen times a season.\n\nWhy they could pull it off\n\nWith a franchise value of $1.5 billion and annual revenues of $266 million, as estimated by Forbes, the White Sox certainly have the wherewithal. Thanks to a bevy of trades to accelerate this rebuild, they have less than $6 million committed to the 2020 payroll and only Anderson is guaranteed money beyond that.\n\nYes, the war chest is deep \u2013 but probably not as deep as, say, the Philadelphia Phillies, who sound willing to commit nearly a billion dollars for both Bryce Harper and Manny Machado.\n\nThe White Sox probably won\u2019t go that crazy, and perhaps would prefer Machado over Harper. Either way, the prospects in the pipeline and the cash on hand create ideal conditions for a significant free agent strike.\n\nWill it happen?\n\nPossibly. The White Sox need a jolt: Attendance fell to 1.6 million last season, their meekest turnout since 1999, and TV ratings on NBC Sports Chicago can only go up. Their 2005 World Series championship bought them significant leeway \u2013 they drew nearly 3 million in 2006 and stayed above the 2 million mark through 2011.\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to regain some of that relevance. Ultimately, winning is the only panacea. Harper would be a key part of that formula \u2013 and in the meantime, make the White Sox matter again."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Richard Wolf, USA TODAY", "title": "President Trump's conservative court shift may slow down as liberal judges avoid retirement", "description": "President Donald Trump's record pace at filling federal appeals court vacancies over the past two years may be approaching a roadblock.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/19/donald-trumps-judges-making-courts-more-conservative-slowly/2005281002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/8ba0c503-1cba-42e4-9a99-7b3c5fc7d3dd-AP_Trump_Supreme_Court.2.jpg?crop=4249,2386,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:19:14Z", "content": "President Trump's judges are beginning to transform the federal courts, but the pace may be slowing.

(Photo: Alex Brandon, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump's record pace at filling federal appeals court vacancies over the past two years may be approaching a slowdown.\n\nSince taking office 22 months ago, Trump has named 29 conservative judges to federal circuit courts, the regional appeals courts that handle more than 50,000 cases a year. The Supreme Court, by comparison, hears about 70.\n\nThe president's success, in addition to Senate confirmation of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, has been heralded by conservatives as his crowning achievement. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and former White House counsel Don McGahn, architects of the judicial agenda, were greeted with thunderous applause last week at the Federalist Society's annual convention here.\n\nIn Trump's third year in office, he is likely to have fewer positions to fill because he has already named judges for many of the vacancies he inherited from President Barack Obama.\n\nLike Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appeals court judges named by Democratic presidents have an incentive to keep their lifetime appointments while Trump is in office.\n\n\u201cSo many vacancies have been filled on the courts of appeals that there just aren\u2019t that many left now,\u201d says Ed Whelan, president of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center.\n\nAs his first two years in office draw to a close, Trump has nominated 154 federal judges, more than any of his five most recent predecessors. Eighty-four of them have been confirmed, including 53 to federal district courts.\n\nThe president is enthusiastic about his chances to boost those numbers because the Senate will have at least 52, and possibly 53, Republicans in the next Congress, up from 51.\n\n\"That means all the judges that I'm getting approved will now be easier,\" he said Saturday before leaving to view fire damage in California. \"That's a tremendous difference.\"\n\n'Fundamental shift'\n\nAt the critical appeals court level, Trump has replaced 19 judges named by Republican presidents and 10 named by Democrats. He has yet to tip the balance in any of the 12 regional courts, but two are close.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, with jurisdiction for Florida, Georgia and Alabama, has gone from a solid majority of judges named by Democrats to a 6-6 tie.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, which oversees Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands, is within one seat of being tied 7-7. Trump's nominee for the last vacancy there, Paul Matey, could be confirmed next month.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s already been a fundamental shift in the composition of the judiciary, and it's only going to get worse in the next two years,\" said Brian Fallon, executive director of the liberal advocacy group Demand Justice.\n\nMore: Trump's 87 picks to be federal judges are 92% white with just one black and one Hispanic nominee\n\nWhen \"senior\" judges are taken into consideration \u2013 those who have left active duty but continue to serve part-time on three-judge panels \u2013 both of those appeals courts have a majority of Republican-named judges. Three others are tied, including the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nTrump's impact, like those of past presidents, eventually could have a direct impact on issues such as affirmative action, gun control, religious freedom and government regulations.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got judges who think that the entire administrative state is unconstitutional,\u201d says Paul Gordon, senior legislative counsel at People for the American Way, which closely tracks judicial nominations.\n\nWhile liberals are concerned about Trump's confirmed judges, conservatives are wary that the pace will slow. That could leave as many as seven appeals courts where Obama left them, with a majority of judges named either by him or President Bill Clinton. Four others are solidly in Republican hands.\n\n'Flipping' circuits\n\nThe past three presidents all had success in \"flipping\" the federal judiciary from one political party's preference to the other, but it took their full eight years in office.\n\nDuring their first two years, George W. Bush made the most nominations, but Clinton had the highest percentage of Senate confirmations. Obama lagged in both categories but managed to reverse Republican-nominated majorities in eight of the 12 federal appeals courts.\n\nThough Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump each put two justices on the Supreme Court, their under-the-radar nominations to federal appeals courts were equally, if not more, important.\n\nMore: Lawyers' group fuels Republicans' ire over its negative reviews of Trump judicial picks\n\n\u201cFor the vast majority of the American people, the final say in what the Constitution means, and whether they have a fair day in court, and whether their legal rights are properly enforced is up to those court of appeals judges,\u201d said Daniel Goldberg, legal director at the liberal Alliance for Justice, which has opposed many of Trump's nominees.\n\nThose judges generally work on randomly selected panels of three, often including senior judges on their path to retirement. Those panels can tilt left or right regardless of a full court's composition. Only active judges participate when a full appeals court agrees to decide a case.\n\nAbout 60 of the nation's 150-plus active appeals court judges are eligible for retirement or senior status, including half of those named by Democratic presidents. All five Democratic nominees on the GOP-dominated 6th Circuit appeals court are at least 65 years old. On the Democrat-dominated 9th Circuit appeals court based in California, nine of the 16 Democratic appointees could retire.\n\nThat isn't likely to happen any time soon. Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice, says the Obama and Clinton judges \"seem to be part of the resistance.\"\n\nWhile Trump is president, Levey says, they may have an \"even stronger temptation\" to stay on as active judges.\n\nMore: Trump's race to remake federal courts proves divisive\n\nMore: President Trump's controversial conservatives vie for federal courts\n\nMore: Federal courts will shift to the right under Trump\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/19/donald-trumps-judges-making-courts-more-conservative-slowly/2005281002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Want a body like 'Creed 2' star Michael B.

Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Trump's national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump took office. George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI about conversations with a professor who said the Russian government had \u201cdirt\u201d on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted by a federal jury in Virginia on eight counts of financial fraud.

USA TODAY\n\nMANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. \u2013 If last year's holiday shopping was all about the connected speaker and saying \"Hey, Google,\" and \"Alexa,\" multiple times after bringing home discounted fare, this year it's all about video.\n\nAmazon has enlarged and enhanced its Echo Show device, which brings video to its line of smart speaker, Google counters with the Home Hub, adding video to the Home line of speakers, and Facebook is in there as well, with its controversial Portal video speaker.\n\nWe've taken all for intensive test drives. Which one is for you? Read on:\n\nHome Hub\n\nThe Google speaker, ($149, on sale for $99 during Black Friday sales) is our all-around favorite of the trio because it does more than the others. It's a digital photo frame, accessing your pictures from the Google Photos app; it's a YouTube viewer, showing videos on command, playing endless songs from the YouTube library and a recipe helper. Ask how to make chicken cacciatore, and it will show you, in step-by-step detail, in words and video, just how to do that. It connects to the cable TV alternative service YouTubeTV if you'd like to watch cable or broadcast TV on the device, along with your Google Calendar, Google Podcasts and other Google functions. Unlike the other two devices, there is no built-in camera for video calls. So while you will still have to live with knowing that every time you say \"Hey, Google,\" your wake word and the command are being recorded, at least you know an always-on video camera isn't pointed at you.\n\nAt 7 inches, the screen is too small and pales in comparison to the other two. But since it does so much more, without the privacy concerns of Facebook's Portal, it gets our top nod.\n\nHow small is the Google Home Hub? So tiny that the Amazon Echo dwarfs it, and Mr. Jinx the cat towers over it. (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nFacebook Portal and Portal+\n\nWith a 10-inch screen for the entry level edition, ($199, on sale for $149 for Black Friday), the Portal has a big, bright screen that's beautiful to look at. Unlike the Home Hub and Echo Show, Portal exists for two key functions: video chat and a digital photo frame.\n\nThe other features \u2013 recipes, watching YouTube clips, listening to podcasts and the like \u2013 can be done, but not on command.\n\nThat said, the video chat looks so good and so superior to any video chat I've ever done before, you may think twice about the perils of letting a Facebook product into your home. (More on that in a minute.)\n\nThe Portal has a built-in camera designed to not just offer a static image of you during a video chat, but the whole family, and it zooms in and out and moves across the screen as others talk, looking like a professionally made video. FaceTime, Skype, Hangouts and the others pale in comparison.\n\nBut Portal is from Facebook, the company that has struggled with outside forces getting into our personal credentials, the firm that's known for taking our personal information and creating targeted advertising out of our likes. This is the social network that served as a portal through which foreign entities wreaked havoc in the 2016 election.\n\nJust last week, a bombshell New York Times report said that Facebook knew about the Russian attack for months before making it public and spent much time and energy on covering it up. It was followed with many calls for the ouster of CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who says he won't step down.\n\nThat said, Facebook says it's not recording the calls you make on Portal but does say it will use the information of whom you called, how long you spoke and where both parties live to potentially target ads to you elsewhere on the Facebook platform.\n\nFacebook's larger model, Portal +, which sells for $349.\n\nUSA TODAY's Edward C. Baig and son Sam waves to Jefferson Graham during a video chat on the Facebook Portal device (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nAmazon Echo Show\n\nThe 2018 Echo Show ($229, but $179 for Black Friday) is larger, at 10 inches versus 7 inches for the previous model, sports improved speakers and serves as a built-in smart home hub to connect smart lightbulbs, home security and the like.\n\nBut in bringing video to Alexa, Amazon has precious little to show us. It can offer up recipes from SideChef, Allrecipes and others, live and on-demand TV from the Hulu service (rates start at $7.99 monthly to watch) but not the world's most popular video service, YouTube, due to a corporate spat between Amazon and YouTube owner Google.\n\nAmazon has a workaround to watch YouTube via an Amazon web browser, but that doesn't really cut it for asking Alexa to play a specific video clip.\n\nNowhere does this play itself out more forcefully than when you ask Google Home Hub to play you a music video, say, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen and then ask Alexa to do the same with the Show.\n\nOn Hub, Freddie Mercury and company are shown singing their multi-part harmonies, while on Show all you get are the lyrics to the song as your visual against the recorded track. (Amazon says we could have requested the song via the Vevo music video service, and it would then have played visually.)\n\nLyrics are a nice touch and great for karaoke, but I'll take the video, thanks.\n\nStill, if we were to rank the speakers, we'd go withHome Hub first, even with the small screen, because it does so many things so well, Show second for the great screen and access to Alexa skills and in last place, Portal.\n\nAs great as the video chat is, Facebook may have to do more to earn trust back first before its microphone- and video camera-connected device gets the welcome mat put out and door opened.\n\nWatching a music video on Amazon Echo Show, Google Pixel 3 and Google Home Hub.

Power. \u201cTo put that in context, it is nearly double the problem rate of the second most prevalent problem, excessive fuel consumption.\u201d\n\nConsumer feedback from Chinese buyers in recent years has been consistent. More than 10 percent of drivers complained about the issue according to the 2018 J.D. Power China Initial Quality Study.\n\nAmericans seem to like it, though.\n\n\u201cWhen I go online, I can find 30 different products that will give my car that new-car smell,\u201d said Brian Moody, executive editor at Autotrader. \u201cAnd now they\u2019ve come up with something to limit it?\u201d\n\nBut China is the largest car market in the world, so automakers take notice.\n\nFord made headlines in July 2017 for \"counting on a team of recruits to its Chinese research labs ... 18 smell testers, or so-called 'Golden Noses,' charged with making sure new cars don\u2019t smell bad,\" Quartz media said. \"That\u2019s because Chinese car buyers are particularly sensitive to the smell of their new cars. They place unpleasant smells ahead of engine performance or safety as their top reason for not buying a new car.\"\n\nSmell testers assess the odor of every item in the car, from floor carpets to the steering wheel, rejecting any that may offend a Chinese buyer, Quartz noted.\n\nThe 2018 Lincoln Navigator L Black Label SUV owned by Joey Maruskin is photographed at his home in Highland Township on Wednesday, February 28, 2018. (Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press)\n\nWhile the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office hasn\u2019t issued a ruling on the \"vehicle odor remediation\" patent application and Ford hasn\u2019t committed to moving forward with the project, the paperwork explains what creates the odor so many Americans like:\n\nThat new-car smell is caused by volatile organic compounds given off by leather, plastic and vinyl. Chemicals used to attach and seal car parts may also contribute to the odor.\n\nPeople notice odors when compounds are released, which occurs when a car sits in high temperatures. Ford scientists describe baking the car until the odor disappears, which happens after compounds are released.\n\nThe process described in the patent involves parking the car in the sun, opening the windows slightly and optionally turning the engine, heater and fan on. The system includes special software and various air quality sensors and works only when fitted to a driverless or semi-autonomous vehicle.\n\nA lot of technology is involved in the patent application. The car would determine whether conditions are right to expel compounds, and the car would drive itself to a place in the sun and bake away the offensive odor.\n\nInterior of the 2018 Navigator (Photo: Ford)\n\nThe company declined to discuss specifics of the technology.\n\n\u201cWhile new-car smell is ingrained in American culture, we know Chinese customers dislike that scent. This patent is the result of years of research and is just one idea we are considering for future use,\u201d said Debbie Mielewski, senior technical leader in materials sustainability at Ford.\n\nThe company indicated it had no specific production plans at this time, Ford spokesman Karl Henkel said.\n\nBut globalization means acknowledging consumer needs worldwide. And Chinese consumers are among the most savvy when it comes to nuance and detail.\n\nAt every turn, automakers are looking for ways to earn Chinese customer loyalty in a new and valuable market, he said.\n\nPeople fail to fully grasp the unusual challenges that face the auto industry, said Maeva Ribas, manager of design analysis at The Carlab, an automotive product planning consulting group based in Southern California.\n\nEven something such as car interior color is hard to standardize because the light is different in different parts of the world and the way people filter color, she said.\n\n\u201cWe do a bunch of research with a Japanese client. Take a beige interior, for example\u201d said Ribas, a native of Monaco, France. \u201cIt just looks different when you see it in Japan versus here in the states. Beige works well there. In California, it looks different. In France, it looks different, too.\"\n\nShe noted the recent use of symphony music by the new Lincoln Aviator to replace beeps and buzzes. \"We know that sound is processed differently by different cultures, as well. So smell would make sense. The insights we get from doing research on those kind of things are just insane, in a very good way.\u201d\n\nPatents keep design options open for companies as they develop new products.\n\nCompanies often acquire patents they may let expire at a later date if the technology is not needed.\n\nFollow Detroit Free Press reporter Phoebe Wall Howard on Twitter @phoebesaid.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/11/19/ford-new-car-smell-patent/2052967002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "The Associated, The Associated", "title": "'Mutiny on the Bounty,' 'Gentleman's Agreement' Oscars up for sale in rare auction", "description": "Two Academy Awards for best picture are going up for sale in a rare auction of Oscars.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/19/oscar-best-picture-gentlemans-agreement-going-auction-mutiny-bounty/2053517002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/2eb99a06-15b1-4fd9-bac1-bfed545aa1ad-AP_Oscars_Auction.JPG?crop=2741,1542,x0,y216&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:51:59Z", "content": "From Lady Gaga to Peter Farrelly, reinvention is this season's most sought-after attribute in the competition for an Oscar.

Frank Capra presented the award to Irving Thalberg at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles when the Academy Awards were less than 10 years old. The award is being put up for sale for the first time by the family of Thalberg, an essential figure in the early history of Hollywood.\n\nThe best-picture Oscar for \"Gentleman's Agreement,\" the 1947 film starring Gregory Peck that took on anti-Semitism and won three Academy Awards, is expected to fetch between $150,000 and $200,000. Its seller wants to remain anonymous.\n\nHans Dreier's art-direction Oscar for 1950's \"Sunset Boulevard\" and Gloria Swanson's Golden Globe for best actress in a drama for the film are also on offer in the December auction along with other historic movie awards.\n\nAuctions of Oscar statuettes are very uncommon because winners from 1951 onward have had to agree that they or their heirs must offer to sell it back to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for $1 before selling it to anyone else. The Academy has said it firmly believes Oscars should be won, not sold.\n\nStill, occasionally Oscars beyond the reach of the rules go up for sale and sell for large sums of money.\n\nThe late Michael Jackson acquired David O. Selznick's \"Gone With the Wind\" Oscar for a record $1.5 million in 1999.\n\nOrson Welles' \"Citizen Kane\" statuette sold for $861,542 in 2011.\n\nAnd in 2014, James Cagney's best-actor Oscar for 1942's \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" failed to sell when no one would meet the minimum bid demand of $800,000.\n\nMore: Governors Awards: Clint Eastwood's Q&A, Cicely Tyson's emotional speech and more moments\n\nMore: Nicole Kidman has two shots at Oscar right now (but calls her career 'so random and weird')\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/19/oscar-best-picture-gentlemans-agreement-going-auction-mutiny-bounty/2053517002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Maeve McDermott, USA TODAY", "title": "Frankie Muniz: My cat 'destroyed' my home and 'everything I own' by turning on the faucet", "description": "Frankie Muniz traveled to France for his uncle's funeral and returned to a flooded home - thanks to his cat.

But, given the position taken by CNN, we now feel obligated to replace previously shared practices with explicit rules.\"\n\nThe White House suspended Acosta's credential Nov. 7, after a contentious exchange with Trump during a news conference when the president called Acosta a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\nIn response, CNN filed a lawsuit \u2013 backed by several media outlets, including USA TODAY \u2013 demanding the return of Acosta's credentials. On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, granted the request and ordered Acosta's pass restored while the rest of the case played out.\n\nKelly said the White House had violated Acosta\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process by suspending his press badge without explanation or a chance for CNN to appeal.\n\nLater Friday, the White House sent CNN a letter that said Acosta's press pass could be revoked again right after a temporary restraining order granted by a federal judge expired after 14 days.\n\nBut the letter Monday detailed several new rules for reporter conduct at presidential press conferences, including \"a single question\" from each journalist. Follow-ups will only be permitted \"at the discretion of the President or other White House officials.\"\n\nSanders said the new rules are:\n\n\u2022A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists.\n\n\u2022At the discretion of the president or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted.

While the Trump administration has called the caravan a potential \"invasion\" \u2013 and mobilized manpower and equipment to the border in response \u2013 the people are fleeing their home countries in Central America to escape violence, corruption and poverty.\n\nMost of the caravan members are trying to enter at the San Ysidro facility, where about 100,000 people, including 40,000 vehicles, legally enter at the border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana.\n\nThe port includes 26 booths to process incoming vehicles to the U.S., all of which were closed Monday morning before some were reopened.

(Photo: John Moore)\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to dramatically cut asylum applications were challenged in two federal court hearings on Monday, and the rulings by each judge will ultimately determine how many members of the migrant caravan will be able to enter the U.S.\n\nHundreds of the Central American caravan members have already arrived in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, prompting U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials on Monday to temporarily close all vehicle lanes and half the pedestrian lanes at the San Ysidro Port of Entry to install additional concrete barriers and concertina wire to prevent a rush of people trying to enter illegally.\n\nBut the two judges \u2014 who did not issue any immediate rulings \u2014 will decide whether caravan members will be able to legally request asylum, a right written into U.S. law and international conventions the U.S. is party to. The Trump administration has taken unprecedented steps in recent months to challenge those rules, cutting back on who can apply and how they can apply.\n\nTrump has been largely silent on the migrant caravan heading to the border since making it a major campaign issue in the midterm elections. But has blasted the migrant caravan in recent days via Twitter.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting U.S.A. asylum because they are fearful of being in their country - yet they are proudly waving their country\u2019s flag. Can this be possible? Yes, because it is all a BIG CON, and the American taxpayer is paying for it!\u201d he tweeted Saturday night. And on Sunday, he tweeted again about the caravan, siding with Tijuana Mayor Manuel Gast\u00e9lum:\n\n\u201cThe Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that \u2018the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months.\u2019 Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nOn Monday, he sent out a series of tweets boasting about his policy changes and how they will ensure that caravan members are \u201cdetained or turned away.\u201d\n\nCatch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away. Dems must approve Border Security & Wall NOW! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2018\n\nBut the ACLU, which is leading both lawsuits, says the recent changes are clear violations of U.S. law and hope to win victories in both court cases.\n\n\"President Trump\u2019s new asylum ban is illegal,\" said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \"Neither the president nor his cabinet secretaries can override the clear commands of U.S. law, but that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re trying to do.\"\n\nAsylum is a form of protection granted to people who fear persecution in their home countries based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinion. From 2000 to 2016, the United States granted asylum to an average of 26,651 foreigners a year, according to Department of Homeland Security data.\n\nThe number of asylum applications has skyrocketed in recent years, from 5,000 in 2008 to 97,000 in 2018, mostly fueled by Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries.\n\nThat increase is partly what prompted the administration to implement two big changes that are now being challenged in Monday's court hearings.\n\nThe first hearing took place in Washington, D.C., where the ACLU and other groups filed a challenge to the administration\u2019s efforts to narrow the grounds that migrants can use to qualify for asylum.\n\nIn June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new policy asserting that victims of domestic abuse and gang violence would no longer qualify for asylum. The lawsuit claims the administration sidestepped U.S. law and implemented its own standards, distorting the asylum process \"beyond recognition.\"\n\nThe second hearing took place in San Francisco, where the ACLU and other groups filed a challenge to the administration\u2019s efforts to limit the process migrants can use to put in their asylum claims.\n\nUp until Nov. 9, migrants could request asylum either by presenting themselves at a port of entry or entering the country illegally and then requesting asylum.\n\nThe 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act states that any foreigner who arrives in the USA, \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival,\" may apply for asylum. A United Nations treaty signed in 1951 by the United States says \"refugees should not be penalized for their illegal entry\" because extreme situations sometimes \"require refugees to breach immigration rules.\"\n\nBut on Nov. 9, Trump tried to overrule those rules, signing a presidential proclamation ending the ability of migrants to request asylum if they enter the country illegally. The administration is relying on the same legal rational it use to implement its controversial travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries \u2014 a section of U.S. law that allows a president to suspend entry of foreigners if deems them \"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"\n\nThe first two versions of the travel ban were shot down in court, but the third was upheld by the Supreme Court. The administration believes that decision gives it the authorization it needs to use that statute more broadly, including in its effort to limit asylum.\n\nNeither judge issued a ruling from the bench, but could issue their opinions any time. Their options include upholding Trump's restrictions, which would likely draw an appeal from the ACLU, or ordering a preliminary injunction blocking Trump's rule changes and allowing migrants to continue applying for asylum, which would likely draw an appeal from the Department of Justice.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/19/donald-trump-asylum-policy-migrant-caravan-mexico-honduras-border-security-immigration-tijuana/2053056002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Erin Jensen, USA TODAY", "title": "Demi Lovato fires back at fan on Instagram: 'You have no idea what you're talking about'", "description": "Demi Lovato, who was rushed to the hospital this summer following an overdose, took to Instagram to set the record straight.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/19/demi-lovato-instagram-danielle-martin-rumors-firing-inner-circle/2052955002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/13582331-e6ae-4d88-a062-b7aa22ac679d-961821124.JPG?crop=4199,2362,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:31:35Z", "content": "Singer Demi Lovato is reportedly hospitalized due to a possible drug overdose after six years of sobriety.

Ask how to make chicken cacciatore, and it will show you, in step-by-step detail, in words and video, just how to do that. It connects to the cable TV alternative service YouTubeTV if you'd like to watch cable or broadcast TV on the device, along with your Google Calendar, Google Podcasts and other Google functions. Unlike the other two devices, there is no built-in camera for video calls.

(Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nFacebook Portal and Portal+\n\nWith a 10-inch screen for the entry level edition, ($199, on sale for $149 for Black Friday), the Portal has a big, bright screen that's beautiful to look at. Unlike the Home Hub and Echo Show, Portal exists for two key functions: video chat and a digital photo frame.\n\nThe other features \u2013 recipes, watching YouTube clips, listening to podcasts and the like \u2013 can be done, but not on command.\n\nThat said, the video chat looks so good and so superior to any video chat I've ever done before, you may think twice about the perils of letting a Facebook product into your home. (More on that in a minute.)\n\nThe Portal has a built-in camera designed to not just offer a static image of you during a video chat, but the whole family, and it zooms in and out and moves across the screen as others talk, looking like a professionally made video. FaceTime, Skype, Hangouts and the others pale in comparison.\n\nBut Portal is from Facebook, the company that has struggled with outside forces getting into our personal credentials, the firm that's known for taking our personal information and creating targeted advertising out of our likes. This is the social network that served as a portal through which foreign entities wreaked havoc in the 2016 election.\n\nJust last week, a bombshell New York Times report said that Facebook knew about the Russian attack for months before making it public and spent much time and energy on covering it up. It was followed with many calls for the ouster of CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who says he won't step down.\n\nThat said, Facebook says it's not recording the calls you make on Portal but does say it will use the information of whom you called, how long you spoke and where both parties live to potentially target ads to you elsewhere on the Facebook platform.\n\nFacebook's larger model, Portal +, which sells for $349.\n\nUSA TODAY's Edward C. Baig and son Sam waves to Jefferson Graham during a video chat on the Facebook Portal device (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nAmazon Echo Show\n\nThe 2018 Echo Show ($229, but $179 for Black Friday) is larger, at 10 inches versus 7 inches for the previous model, sports improved speakers and serves as a built-in smart home hub to connect smart lightbulbs, home security and the like.\n\nBut in bringing video to Alexa, Amazon has precious little to show us. It can offer up recipes from SideChef, Allrecipes and others, live and on-demand TV from the Hulu service (rates start at $7.99 monthly to watch) but not the world's most popular video service, YouTube, due to a corporate spat between Amazon and YouTube owner Google.\n\nAmazon has a workaround to watch YouTube via an Amazon web browser, but that doesn't really cut it for asking Alexa to play a specific video clip.\n\nNowhere does this play itself out more forcefully than when you ask Google Home Hub to play you a music video, say, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen and then ask Alexa to do the same with the Show.\n\nOn Hub, Freddie Mercury and company are shown singing their multi-part harmonies, while on Show all you get are the lyrics to the song as your visual against the recorded track. (Amazon says we could have requested the song via the Vevo music video service, and it would then have played visually.)\n\nLyrics are a nice touch and great for karaoke, but I'll take the video, thanks.\n\nStill, if we were to rank the speakers, we'd go withHome Hub first, even with the small screen, because it does so many things so well, Show second for the great screen and access to Alexa skills and in last place, Portal.\n\nAs great as the video chat is, Facebook may have to do more to earn trust back first before its microphone- and video camera-connected device gets the welcome mat put out and door opened.\n\nWatching a music video on Amazon Echo Show, Google Pixel 3 and Google Home Hub. The video plays on the Google devices, while the lyrics play over an image on Echo Show (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nHave questions about the video speakers? We're here to help.

They became instrumental in Vanellope realizing that she is a princess, too, and that her dreams matter as well.\u201d\n\nReview: 'Ralph Breaks the Internet' but not the Disney mold\n\nMore: See first photos of Taraji P. Henson, Disney princesses in 'Wreck-It Ralph 2'\n\nSnippets of Vanellope being introduced to classic icons like Snow White and Cinderella were a hit on social media when the trailer debuted last summer, though fans complained that Princess Tiana, the heroine of \u201cThe Princess and the Frog,\u201d had her skin lightened and nose slimmed for \"Ralph.\"\n\nJohnston says he and Rich Moore \u201cwere instantly engaged\u201d with making corrections to the final film. \u201cWe looked at it and were like, \u2018Yeah, this needs to be better.

Yet when Vanellope hangs with the princesses, there\u2019s some great \u201cfemale-empowerment stuff\u201d in a movie that on the surface is seemingly a male story.\n\n\u201cWe're giving girls this version of themselves in a Disney movie, a company that, for better or worse, has created a lot of these stereotypes over the years through the princess thing,\u201d Reilly says. \u201cIt's a moment of reckoning for Disney and it's a moment of reckoning for the world, and I'm just so excited for girls to see the movie. Sarah herself is a really empowered woman, and the fact that she gets to sort of speak her truth in a cartoon from Disney is pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/19/why-disney-princesses-moment-matters-ralph-breaks-internet/2047076002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Voice commands are so last year, it's all about video", "description": "USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham takes a look at three new connected speakers that all have video features.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/2018/11/19/voice-commands-so-last-year-its-all-video/2032273002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/17/USAT/b81f8738-0aea-4955-a67f-ea38196b5d9c-THUMB2.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:02:12Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Chargers Wire", "title": "Chargers still have plenty of breathing room in the AFC playoff race", "description": "The Chargers lost to a divisional opponent.

(Photo: Pixabay)\n\nAfter November 6th, the marijuana industry saw another huge stride towards full legalization in the United States.\n\nMichigan, Oklahoma, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin and Utah all had cannabis initiatives appearing on local and state-wide ballots in the midterm elections.\n\nWhy do I think this is so important to know about?\n\nFrankly, I don\u2019t care about cannabis itself\u2026 but I sure do care about massive opportunities for forward-thinking investors\u2026 which is EXACTLY what I see here.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Financial experts from all over the world agree: a marijuana boom is coming.\n\nTo the tune of an estimated $50 billion.\n\nAnd here at The Motley Fool, we\u2019ve identified a little-known Canadian company that might have just unlocked the key to profiting off marijuana.\n\nThe state of cannabis\n\nCannabis legalization is sweeping over North America:\n\n9 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C. legalized recreational marijuana in recent years\n\nFull legalization in Canada as of October 17th\n\nSeven U.S. states vote on marijuana initiatives on November 6th\n\nLegal cannabis worth $10 billion for the U.S. in 2017 alone\n\nAnd since some experts have projected the American industry to skyrocket to as much as $50 billion by 2026, I think it\u2019s time for investors to start paying attention.\n\nBut until recently, it\u2019s also an industry that we\u2019ve stayed on the fence about. it\u2019s a relatively new field\u2026 untested\u2026 unproven.\n\nAnd while The Motley Fool analysts love being on the cutting-edge of new investing trends\u2026\n\n\u2026like picking Amazon at $15.31 a share\u2026\n\n\u2026Netflix at $1.85 a share\u2026\n\n\u2026or Disney at $1.84 a share\u2026\n\n\u2026we\u2019ve been quiet on this growing marijuana industry for a while.\n\nUntil now.\n\nBecause a game-changing deal just went down between the Ontario government and a powerhouse Canadian company.\n\nAnd that company \u2013 which now has the opportunity to rake in profits from the $7 billion Canadian cannabis industry AND potentially the $50 billion US cannabis industry \u2013 is no stranger to us here at The Motley Fool.\n\nBecause we\u2019ve actually recommended this company before\u2026 for completely different reasons! And take a look at how it\u2019s done since we recommended it to our members in July 2016:\n\n409% returns since\n\n86% sales growth in last quarter alone\n\nEstimated 98% of addressable market left to conquer\n\nThis small Canadian powerhouse has locked in key partnerships with behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, and now the Ontario government.\n\nAnd even with all that, the company\u2019s CEO declared that he thinks they\u2019re only 2-3% into what this company could eventually become.\n\nWe here at The Motley Fool are convinced we\u2019re only in the VERY early days of this company\u2019s trajectory.\n\nWhich means there could still be boatloads more profit to be had for in-the-know investors who are prepared to take action.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t like to brag\u2026 but here at The Motley Fool, we\u2019ve had a pretty good track record of picking trends before they get big. Take a look at a few of the companies we picked to dominate their field:\n\nNetflix, up 19,690%\n\nAmazon, up 12,483%\n\nBookings Holdings, up 8,026%\n\nWalt Disney, up 5,857%\n\nIf you\u2019d invested $1,000 in each of those companies when we recommended them in Stock Advisor, you\u2019d be sitting on $464,560 right now.\n\nWhich brings me back to this latest find.\n\nThis company\u2019s future doesn\u2019t hinge on marijuana. If all forms of THC are banned forever in the United States, we think this company still has an incredible field of opportunity. (Heck, that\u2019s why we recommended it in the first place!)\n\nBut now that there\u2019s an estimated $50 billion industry emerging from the woodwork, their prospects are positively mouth-watering \u2013 and we think you\u2019ll regret not getting invested now.\n\nBecause after November 6th, there\u2019s the potential for even more capitalization for this small company. And if you\u2019re not invested before then, you may come to regret it.\n\nForget penny pot stocks.\n\nForget untried, inexperienced cannabis farmers.\n\nTHIS is the company we think you should have in your portfolio if you want to position yourself wisely for the coming marijuana boom.\n\nAnd even though this company has had unprecedented success so far\u2026 and they\u2019ve just made a history-defining deal with the Canadian government\u2026 far fewer investors than you might expect are taking advantage of this VERY rare moment.\n\nDue to the urgency of this recent development, we put together a thorough report that shows you how this emerging industry could potentially mint its own \u201cmarijuana millionaires\u201d.\n\nIt reveals the reasons why we think every forward-thinking investor should be paying close attention to this revolutionary new industry and what might be a potentially life-changing investment opportunity.\n\nBest of all, this report is FREE to you when you sign up for Stock Advisor today.\n\nSimply enter your email address here to access this FREE report today.\n\nPast performance is not a predictor of future results.

Final research results published in The New England Journal of Medicine were also presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting on Sunday.\n\nA phase three trial included 551 people, most ages 4 to 17 with a history of life-threatening reactions after eating peanuts. Participants were given the experimental drug derived from peanuts daily over the course of several months.\n\nStudy authors hoped the treatment could allow patients one or two peanuts a day without a severe reaction. Allergist and co-author Stephen Tilles said he was pleased to discover that two-thirds of the people in the study could tolerate two peanuts daily after nine to 12 months of treatment \u2013 and half could eat four peanuts a day. Almost all children experienced allergic reactions over the yearlong trial funded by Aimmune Therapeutics, but less than 5 percent were classified as severe.\n\n\"We're excited about the potential to help children and adolescents with peanut allergy protect themselves against accidentally eating a food with peanut in it,\" Tilles, the past president of ACAAI, said in a statement.\n\nHe told USA TODAY continuing a daily dose of the treatment, which was administered as a powder sprinkled on food, will be necessary, unless longterm studies are able to show lasting effects without the drug.\n\nThere are currently no approved treatments available for those who suffer peanut allergies.\n\nCo-author and allergist Jay Lieberman, vice chair of the ACAAI Food Allergy Committee, expects the drug could be approved for use later next year.\n\n\"This is not a quick fix, and it doesn't mean people with (a) peanut allergy will be able to eat peanuts whenever they want,\" Lieberman said in a statement. \"But it is definitely a breakthrough.\"\n\nFollow Ashley May on Twitter: @AshleyMayTweets\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/19/peanut-allergy-drug-medicine-ready-fda-review-offers-hope/2052833002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Jets Wire", "title": "2019 NFL draft order: Jets move up a spot during their bye week", "description": "The race to the bottom is on with just six games to go this season.

My wife has always wanted a convertible. This year was our 20th anniversary, and with the oldest going to college next year we figured it was now or a long time from now,\u201d Person wrote in an email to the USA TODAY Network's Detroit Free Press.\n\nBut Person, a married father of four, became troubled by something about his dream SUV, a problem that kept him off the road for a month recently.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that Jeepophiles call the death wobble, and it's something that has prompted quite a bit of online diagnosis. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has started looking into some recent complaints about the issue.\n\nDeath wobble is a term that sounds dramatic, but it is not known to have led to any deaths. A spokesman for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which owns the Jeep brand, references the term \u201csteering system vibration\u201d when answering queries about it.\n\nThe issue arises after a vehicle hits a bump at highway speeds and then the steering wheel begins to shake, sometimes \"violently.\" Online videos claiming to demonstrate the issue show the wheels of some older or modified Jeeps moving back and forth rapidly after driving over a board or similar obstruction.\n\nThe phenomenon prompted concern from lawmakers in years past, but it has begun popping up again recently in a number of consumer complaints on the NHTSA website about the redesigned 2018 Jeep Wrangler JL.\n\nViolent shaking\n\nA sort of typical description \u2014 unverified as such complaints to NHTSA are \u2014 came from a driver in Farmington Hills at the end of October who said he experienced the wobble on I-696 during heavy rush hour traffic:\n\n\u201cVehicles tires begin to shake violently at speeds in the 70-75 mph range on the highway. Condition occurs after hitting a small bump on the highway. The condition becomes so violent, I have to slow the vehicle from 70+ mph to about 40 mph to stop the shaking. \u2026\u201d\n\nA Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the issue is not a safety problem and can happen with any vehicle that has a solid front axle (rather than an independent front suspension), such as the Wrangler. Solid front axle vehicles are usually considered more capable in extreme off-road conditions, which is one of the Wrangler's big selling points.\n\n\u201cSteering system vibration is not a widespread condition, nor is it a safety issue,\u201d according to an email from Mike Palese, a company spokesman.\n\nOn Friday, eight complaints on the NHTSA website listed the words \u201cdeath wobble\u201d with 2018 Jeep Wrangler, but a search of \u201csteering\u201d and 2018 Jeep Wrangler generated more than 200 complaints. The vast majority describe issues such as overly stiff or drifting steering, but some also describe a violent shaking after hitting a bump or shift in pavement type at highway speeds, just like the death wobble. A number of those who have filed complaints said the shaking stopped only after the vehicle slowed down.\n\nThe issue appears primarily focused on Jeep Wranglers, but a few complaints about the wobble name the 2018 Ford F-250 as well. In response to a request last Monday for comment, a Ford spokeswoman said she would look into the issue but did not provide a comment.\n\nFederal examination\n\nNHTSA said it is aware of the issue, citing 11 complaints in the last month, and is checking into it. The agency did not say whether vehicles that experience such steering system vibrations are safe. If the number of new complaints does not grow significantly, it would represent a fraction of the Wranglers on the road, with FCA reporting 204,269 Wranglers sold this year through October.\n\nPalese said it is FCA\u2019s understanding that \u201cNHTSA has looked at this over the years and determined it was not a safety issue.\u201d He indicated there is no connection between the vibration complaints and a recall of 18,000 2018 and 2019 Wrangler JLs for problem welds.\n\nReports of the wobble in 2012 prompted letters from U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo and then-U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, both California Democrats, to the late FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne as well as NHTSA officials raising concerns about the issue.\n\nIn March of that year, San Francisco\u2019s KGO-TV (Channel 7) posted a story saying it had found more than 600 complaints to NHTSA about Jeeps wobbling or vibrating since 1995, listing no deaths but five injuries.\n\nNHTSA sent a letter to Eshoo in April of that year, describing the issue as a front suspension shimmy. The agency, according to a copy of the letter posted at the Center for Auto Safety website, said it found 402 relevant complaints out of the 542,134 2005-10 Wranglers and two possibly relevant crashes, \u201cone of which alleged nonfatal injuries.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 The complaint narratives indicate that, while the condition is disconcerting to drivers, it does not result in loss of control such as the vehicle moving out of its travel lane,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe agency said a similar issue had been investigated in 2005-07 Ford F-250 and F-350 Super Duty trucks, but it had found \u201cno basis for a safety recall.\u201d\n\nThe current batch of complaints does not list any deaths or injuries.\n\nThe email from FCA said that \u201cany manufacturer vehicle equipped with a solid axle can experience steering system vibration and, if experienced, it is routinely corrected.\u201d\n\nMost incidents are linked to vehicle modifications, such as poorly installed lift kits or oversized tires, damaged or worn steering system components or incorrect tire pressure or wheel balance, according to the email.\n\nBut in checking the complaints, many describe recently purchased vehicles with no modifications.\n\nPerson, 44, called his Wrangler an \u201coverall pretty stock Sport model with some basic comfort and convenience options,\u201d which he purchased this year at Colonial Dodge Chrysler Jeep in Hudson, Massachusetts, for just under $38,000.\n\nThe first time he experienced the issue was at the end of September, driving south on I-495 near Hopkinton, Massachusetts. He was taking one of his children to a basketball tournament.\n\n\u201cI hit a bump that should have been nothing and all of a sudden I thought I had a flat tire or something else bad because the whole car and steering wheel starting shaking. I slowed down and was getting ready to pull over and then it went away when I slowed down enough (probably around 50 mph),\" he said.\n\n\u201cIt was concerning, but right that second I just brushed it off,\" Person said. \"Same thing happened once or twice more that weekend on the highway and then once again Monday or Tuesday on the way to work so I called for an appointment to get it checked.\u201d\n\nPerson has since gotten his Wrangler back from the dealership following repairs after being told the steering stabilizer was \u201cshot and had no pressure.\u201d Person said he was told by the dealership that it was a safety issue, and he should not be driving the vehicle.\n\nA call from the Free Press to a manager at the dealership was not returned.\n\nPerson, who is an electrical engineer by training but now designs and tests baseball protective equipment, is skeptical of the company's explanations about the issue. He said he drove a past generation Wrangler as a rental while his Wrangler was being repaired and another this summer for a week without the issue.\n\nHe said he is \u201cnot buying that it\u2019s \u2018not a safety issue.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cHaving to rapidly slow down in the center lane of a highway while going 70 mph definitely is unsafe and the amount of vibration happening from this is just bound to break something eventually,\u201d Person said. \u201cI don't want a steering or suspension component snapping at 70 mph.\u201d\n\nFollow Detroit Free Press reporter Eric D.

He then wrote about the exchange in a blog post.\n\nThe retired admiral also went after Trump in an August letter published in The Washington Post for revoking former CIA director John Brennan's security clearance.\n\n\"I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Through your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation.\"\n\nWithout naming McRaven, Trump on Monday repeated his assertion that bin Laden should have been captured sooner, amid cable news reports that characterized his comments as mocking McRaven and the U.S. military. Trump added that bin Laden was on his radar before the 9/11 attacks.\n\nHe blamed Bill Clinton for missing \u201chis shot\u201d at bin Laden, an apparent reference to a 1998 cruise missile strike launched by the Clinton administration in response to the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa that same year. The strike missed bin Laden by several hours.\n\n\"Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center,\" Trump tweeted. \"President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!\"\n\nOf course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did.

A former SEAL and special forces commander, McRaven led the 2011 operation that killed bin Laden in Pakistan. And he ran the task force that hunted down former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\nTrump has had a contentious relationship with the news media since he announced his candidacy in 2015. He began to refer to coverage he disliked as \"fake news\" after the 2016 election \u2013 co-opting a term that had previously been applied to overtly false social media stories disguised as news.\n\nAfter taking office, he upped the ante, labeling media outlets he disliked the \"enemy of the American people.\"\n\nThis month, the Trump administration revoked the press credentials for CNN correspondent Jim Acosta after a heated exchange between Acosta and the president at a White House news conference. On Friday a federal judge ordered Acosta's credential be returned.\n\nMore: Why a retired Navy SEAL commander wants Trump to revoke his security clearance\n\nContributing: John Fritze\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/11/19/william-mcraven-responds-trump/2052836002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY Sports, USA TODAY Sports", "title": "Former Cowboys LB Jeff Rohrer marries Joshua Ross", "description": "Former Dallas Cowboys linebacker Jeff Rohrer is believed to be the first gay former NFL player to have a same-sex wedding.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/sports/nfl/cowboys/2018/11/19/dallas-cowboys-jeff-rohrer-joshua-ross/2052945002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/52c21a7b-ff07-4148-8b16-71d9ebb5c4ec-XXX_USAT_SI_NFL_dec_303.JPG?crop=4159,2339,x0,y133&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:13:48Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nFormer Dallas Cowboys linebacker Jeff Rohrer (left) exchanges vows with Joshua Ross (right) during their wedding at Wattles Mansion and Garden.

Ultimate' brings the classic fight to the Switch\n\nCLOSE Nintendo\u2019s popular crossover fighting game is finally coming to the Switch on December 7 with 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.' USA TODAY\n\nTo say that there is excitement for Nintendo's \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" for the Switch is a bit of an understatement.\n\nOver 3 million people have watched the company's recent 40-minute Nintendo Direct reveal on YouTube to get the latest information before the game arrives Dec. 7. It's the first console \"Smash\" game since 2014's \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.\"\n\nAfter playing the game for roughly an hour earlier this month at an event in New York, I am pleased to say that, at first blush, the wait seems to be worth it.\n\nPulling in characters from over 30 different game franchises, this version truly is the all-encompassing game one would expect from the \"Ultimate\" title. Staples such as Mario, Kirby and Pikachu are all here, as are characters from different versions of \"Smash\" such as Snake from \"Metal Gear Solid,\" Sonic the Hedgehog and Pac-Man.\n\nNewcomers for this round include Ridley from the \"Metroid\" series, Incineroar from \"Pok\u00e9mon\" and the Inklings from \"Splatoon.\"\n\nA battle in Nintendo's 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.' (Photo: Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY)\n\nAll told, there are 74 playable characters in the new game with over 100 \"stages\" \u2014 or arenas \u2014 to battle with them on, a far cry from the 12 playable characters found on the original \"Super Smash Bros.\" that came out for the Nintendo 64 nearly 20 years ago.\n\nSix additional characters and stages will be available for purchase as downloadable content after the game releases. One character, the Piranha Plant from the \"Mario\" series, will be free for those who purchase and register the game with their Nintendo account before Jan. 31.\n\n\"Ultimate\" has a few different game modes. There's a story-like mode called \"World of Light\" that players can use to unlock the different characters. \"Spirit board\" mode lets you unlock different enhancements for those characters. And, of course, there is the traditional \"Smash\" mode that lets you pit different characters against one another, battling against friends or the computer.\n\nThe original eight characters from the first \"Smash\" game \u2014 Mario, Link, Donkey Kong, Pikachu, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby and Fox \u2014 are available to start, with others available to be unlocked as you play.\n\nThe many characters you can play with in 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.' (Photo: Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY)\n\nIn my brief time with the game, I wasn't able to explore much of the other modes. I was, however, able to play a few games of \"Smash,\" the mode that those who buy this game will likely spend most of their time in.\n\nWith beautiful HD graphics, the cartoon game looks clear, colorful and vivid on the large flat screen TV I was playing on. The controls are simple and unchanged from earlier versions of the game and using Nintendo's Pro Controller (an optional $69.99 more traditional gamepad) played as one would expect.\n\nGamers play 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate' on the Nintendo Switch. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT)\n\nPlayers will also be able to use the Switch's built-in screen and the console's included Joy-Con controllers to play on the go, though I wasn't able to try that out at this event. Nintendo will also be selling a GameCube controller for $29.99 that works with the Switch, but this accessory was similarly not available to demo.\n\nNor did Nintendo showcase the online mode, which lets you play with up to four different players over the Internet through the company's Nintendo Switch Online subscription service. Up to eight players can battle together in the same room off one Switch console, assuming you have enough controllers to pass around.\n\nRolling around as Sonic, beating up other players as Pac-Man and zapping competitors as Pikachu was a blast. New features such as a \"stage morph\" that changes the battlefield mid-game are a welcome twist that is sure to keep matches lively.\n\nWhile most multiplayer games today are primarily online-focused, there is a welcome nostalgia factor when playing \"Smash\" together with others huddled around the same screen playing the same game in the same room, an experience prior \"Smash\" players will remember all too well.\n\nFrom the classic characters to the traditional gameplay, that type of callback is a theme with the latest \"Smash.\" But in the \"Fortnite\" era of massive online \"Battle Royale\" games, having this type of throwback is a welcome change of pace.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/19/super-smash-bros-ultimate-brings-classic-fight-switch/2005669002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Charles Curtis", "title": "LeBron James was 'adamant' with Cavaliers GM: Do not trade Kyrie Irving", "description": "They did it anyway.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/lebron-james-kyrie-irving-trade-cleveland-cavaliers-celtics-lakers", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/usp_nba-_boston_celtics_at_cleveland_cavaliers-e1510069240175.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:02:21Z", "content": "On Wednesday, LeBron James will return to play against the Cavaliers for the first time since leaving Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers this summer.

By the end of the call, according to four separate accounts of people present for the conversation, Altman told James the trade would not occur. Minutes later, on Aug. 22, 2017, word broke that the Cavs agreed in principle to send Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and Brooklyn\u2019s 2018 first-round pick. James\u2019 close friend, Randy Mims, and bodyguard Rob Brown came to him with their phones to show him the news. James, who was still signing jerseys, dropped the pen and slumped in his chair. \u2026 James suggested he didn\u2019t feel he was lied to by Altman, so much as Altman was overruled by owner Dan Gilbert. \u201cYou realize at that point in time, take nothing from Koby, because Koby (was just named GM), but at that point in time, you realize that Koby\u2019s not the only one running the team, as (former GM David Griffin) had done, and that\u2019s why Griff was let go pretty much,\u201d James said.\n\nWe know that James\u2019 relationship with Gilbert was icy to say the least, particularly after the now-infamous scathing letter written in Comic Sans font after James bolted for Miami years ago.\n\nBut we also know that James was a year away from making another free-agent decision, and that\u2019s where the Cavs\u2019 front office\u2019s response is key:\n\nCavs front-office officials declined to be quoted for this story but disputed that Altman gave James any indication the trade would not occur. They also said Altman asked James whether he would commit to the Cavs long-term if Irving were not traded, and James said no.\n\nIn other words, it was a complicated situation for Cleveland\u2019s brass: If James did indeed want the team to keep Irving but he had the potential to leave, what should the Cavaliers done? Start a rebuild or hope James would decide to stay? Then you have to factor in reports that Irving was unhappy at the time \u2014 The Athletic story mentions he \u201ctold the Cavs he wanted out so badly he\u2019d go ahead with knee surgery and miss a large portion of the year.\u201d\n\nThey chose to kick-start the rebuild, and here we are over a year later. Irving will contend for a title with the Celtics, James and the Lakers are figuring out how to work together and the Cavs are a mess."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Josh Peter, USA TODAY", "title": "Former Cowboys linebacker Jeff Rohrer marries partner", "description": "Jeff Rohrer, a former NFL linebacker, is the first known NFL player to marry a man.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/19/jeff-rohrer-ex-cowboys-nfl-player-wedding-joshua-ross/2052865002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/8e68c232-650e-4cf7-9698-8d5ea917bc9d-XXX_USAT_SI_NFL_dec_303.JPG?crop=3162,1779,x466,y169&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:02:12Z", "content": "Former Dallas Cowboys linebacker Jeff Rohrer (left) celebrates his marriage to Joshua Ross (right).

USA TODAY\n\nFlorence Pugh as Charlie Ross and Alexander Skarsgard as Gadi on \"The Little Drumer Girl.\" (Photo: Jonathan Olley/AMC/Ink Factory)\n\nSpies never go out of style, even if the wars they're fighting do.\n\nOn the heels of 2016's \"The Night Manager,\" AMC has bet on another John le Carre adaptation with \"The Little Drummer Girl,\" a caper set amid the 1970s Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Like \"Night Manager,\" it features A-list stars \u2013 Alexander Skarsgard, Michael Shannon and brilliant up-and-comer Florence Pugh \u2013 beautiful locations and cinematic direction, this time from director Park Chan-wook (\"Stoker\"), making his television debut.\n\nBut \"Night Manager\" was a simpler story with a cackling villain and clear moral boundaries, while \"Drummer Girl\" (Monday through Wednesday, 9 EST/PST, \u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four) is its near polar opposite, a tale of mixed loyalties, gray morality and futile fighting.\n\nThere's far more context and complexity to the Middle Eastern conflict than \"Drummer Girl\" can address in six episodes that focus mostly on a white woman. The series' piecemeal approach to explaining the grievances of both the Israelis and Palestinians feels like lip service, and it's a frequent weakness. But thanks to Pugh's fantastic performance and the offbeat style of Park's direction, \"Drummer Girl\" mostly glosses over those flaws and marches to a thrilling beat.\n\nPugh stars as Charlie, a young, struggling actress with a penchant for lying and a flirtation with the radical left. Her talents on stage and a chance encounter with Michel, a Palestinian terrorist, makes her the perfect target for Israeli intelligence officer Gadi (Skarsgard), who's part of a plan masterminded by Mossad spymaster Kurtz (Shannon) to take the terrorists down.\n\nGadi and Kurtz recruit Charlie to pose as Michel's lover and infiltrate his organization while they follow the leads she unearths. The deeper Charlie gets into the Palestinians' cause, the less sure she is that she's on the right side.\n\nFlorence Pugh as Charlie in \"The Little Drummer Girl.\" (Photo: Jonathan Olley/AMC/Ink Factory)\n\nThe success of the series hinges on Pugh's performance, and she delivers effortlessly. She has become one of Hollywood's most in-demand new stars after a breakout role in the indie \"Lady Macbeth,\" and it's easy to see why. Pugh has a magnetic screen presence, given yet another starmaking turn among many (you can also catch her in \"Outlaw King,\" now streaming on Netflix). She joyfully embodies Charlie, a woman made of contradictions who slides far too easily into the dangerous world offered by Gadi. The 22-year-old actress conveys maturity beyond her years, deftly conveying Charlie's shifting emotions and loyalties.\n\nShannon, too, is as strong as ever as the gruff intelligence mastermind, frustrated by his superiors' dated approach to the clandestine services. Shannon isn't physically intimidating, and he's made less so by an almost comically bushy mustache and curly wig, but he conveys power and gravitas as Kurtz. Skarsgard is the weakest link of the headlining trio, offering a somber, largely one-note performance as a moody handler who's pulled back into the game by Kurtz's grand scheme but quickly regrets bringing Charlie into the fold.\n\nDaniel Litman as Daniel, Michael Moshonov as Litvak and Michael Shannon as Kurtz on \"The Little Drummer Girl.\" (Photo: Jonathan Olley/AMC/Ink Factory)\n\n\"Drummer Girl\" makes a concerted effort to give voice to both Israelis and Palestinians with whom Charlie crosses paths, and we're frequently reminded of atrocities on both sides of the conflict. As much as this may keep \"Drummer Girl\" in the political neutral zone, it also prevents the series from having a distinct point of view. It's hard to decipher what, exactly, the miniseries is trying to say, given the lengths it goes to avoid taking sides. Confusion seeps into the storytelling as well, and some elements of the plot are nonsensical. The details of Charlie's recruitment and mission seem to get murkier the further she dives into the world of espionage.\n\nPark's direction adds a surrealism that helps gloss over some of the less-streamlined elements. In stark contrast with most dark and dreary espionage tales, \"Drummer Girl\" is shot mostly in startling daylight, with its characters clad in bright colors, an aesthetically gorgeous choice. This style only emphasizes Charlie's exposure and vulnerability and helps keep the series light despite its serious subject matter.\n\nThe weak moments in \"Drummer Girl\" come and go, but the beautiful scenery, transfixing acting and tense action remain throughout, and those are worth tuning in for. You may be confused at times watching Charlie, but you'll never take your eyes off her.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/19/little-drummer-girl-review-amc-john-le-carre-spy-thriller-alexander-skarsgaard-florence-pugh/2011435002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY", "title": "YouTube quietly adds 100 ad-supported movies for free viewing", "description": "The video network now has a section for free movie viewing, from the MGM library (Legally Blonde, Terminator) alongside films it charges to view on a pay-per-view basis.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/19/youtube-now-offers-free-movies-see-including-rocky-pink-panther-films/2048931002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/18/USAT/ac4aade5-e8f9-400e-ab63-5f0a58ee1fae-Google_ChromeScreenSnapz080.jpg?crop=2492,1402,x112,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:00:04Z", "content": "Start popping the popcorn.

The medical readiness rate for generals has improved to nearly 85 percent, according to Brig. Gen. Omar Jones, the Army's top spokesman. Almost all generals, 97.4 percent, can now deploy after taking care of minor issues such as having updated blood tests and dental exams.\n\n\"The Army's top priority is readiness and soldiers are expected to be world-wide deployable to ensure our Army is ready to fight today and in the future,\" Jones said. \"The data from 2016 does not reflect recent improvements in medical readiness for the Army as a whole and for the general officer corps specifically.\"\n\nThe data were contained in a June 2017 report on the state of the Army's general officer corps that was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The study was commissioned after a series of high-profile scandals involving generals and admirals came to light. In 2014, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel created an office to investigate ethical problems among senior leaders. An investigation by USA TODAY last year found that military investigators had documented at least 500 cases of serious misconduct among its generals, admirals and senior civilians, almost half of those instances involving personal or ethical lapses.\n\nOne of the most recent cases involved Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Tibbets, who was fired for making sexually suggestive comments to women and failing to report suicide attempts among airmen in his command.\n\nMost of the Army's 2017 report released to USA TODAY was redacted. However, sections that included data on deployability for generals and programs to improve their mental and physical health were included. It noted \"Points of Stress\" for generals that include combat, deployment, family separation, loss and uncertainty. Another category termed, \"Complicators,\" listed aging, caring for parents, disease risk and teenagers.\n\nData for 2016 showed that 83.5 percent of Army soldiers were deemed medically ready to deploy, the lowest rate among the services. The Marine Corps led with 90.2 percent followed by the Navy at 90.1 percent and the Air Force at 88.8 percent. The rate for active-duty, ready-to-deploy generals, not including the Reserve or National Guard, was 79.6 percent. For active-duty soldiers overall, the figure was 84 percent, and the Army's goal is 85 percent.\n\nThe top factors for failing to meet the standard was being overdue for an annual physical or dental exam, a relatively easy fix. The report included a recommendation to \"Enforce Wellness\" that enables generals to receive the evaluations and treatment they needed and \"ensure that they do so.\"\n\nTo that end, the Army has sent 62 generals to its executive health program at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, Jones said. Over a three-day period, generals receive health-care services and assessments. By the end of 2019, 234 more generals will have been through the program.\n\nJones noted that gains had been made and are reflected in the medical readiness for generals, which is now 84.7 percent.\n\nMattis took office in January 2017, and this year served notice that he was making readiness to fight a top priority for the Pentagon.\n\nIf troops can't deploy, Mattis said, others must take their place. The burden of combat and time away from family falls unevenly, he said. Exceptions are made for those wounded in combat or injured in accidents.\n\n\"But this is a deployable military,\" Mattis told reporters in February. \"It's a lethal military that aligns with our allies and partners. If you can't go overseas in your combat load \u2013 carry a combat load, then obviously someone else has got to go. I want this spread fairly and equitably across the force.\"\n\nThe report also recommends that generals look after their own \"wellness.\" It encourages them to take at least one 10-day vacation away from their posts and to get enough sleep.\n\nThere's advice from Gen. John Nicholson, at the time the top commander of troops in Afghanistan. Nicholson uses the \"2/3/7\" rule. He asks each of his leaders to spend two hours a day alone, eat three meals and sleep for at least seven hours a night.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/19/one-five-army-generals-were-not-cleared-combat-2016/2029702002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Donovan Slack, USA TODAY, and Andrea Estes, The Boston Globe, USA TODAY", "title": "'Nothing short of horrifying:' Veterans' groups demand fixes at VA nursing homes", "description": "Vet groups on 'horrifying' VA nursing home reports: Fix it", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/19/va-nursing-homes-veteran-groups-want-fixes-after-horrifying-reports-trump-administration-congress/2018781002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.krem.com/assets/GANNETT/images/d10b3817-1923-4116-8478-7a657f312fc4/d10b3817-1923-4116-8478-7a657f312fc4_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T12:51:28Z", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Six veterans\u2019 groups are calling on the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve the quality of care at its nursing homes following a story by USA TODAY and The Boston Globe detailing \u201c blatant disregard for veteran safety \u201d at a VA nursing home\u2026 [+7060 chars]", "fulltext": "CLOSE Don Ruch\u2019s family thought round-the-clock care would help him recuperate, but he ended up in intensive care in septic shock, suffering from \u201csevere\u201d malnutrition, bedsores on his pelvis and back, a burn on his right thigh and a trauma wound.

A whistleblower had reported that nurses and aides did not empty the bedside urinals of frail veterans, they failed to provide clean water at night and didn\u2019t check on the veterans regularly. The VA said the napping nurses no longer work at the facility.\n\nThe story was the latest in an investigation by USA TODAY and the Globe that revealed care at many VA nursing facilities was worse than at private nursing homes in the agency\u2019s own internal ratings, kept secret from veterans for years.\n\nThe stories detailed disturbing examples of substandard care \u2013 a veteran with undiagnosed scabies for months, another struggling to eat in Bedford, Massachussetts; and a third sitting for hours in soiled sheets and another writhing in pain without medication in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nA Navy veteran was declared dead after he walked out of a supposedly secure VA nursing home and was never found in Tuskegee, Alabama. An Army vet landed in intensive care suffering from malnutrition, septic shock and bed sores after a stay at a VA nursing home in Livermore, California.\n\n\u201cThe stories being reported about the treatment of some individual veterans at these facilities are nothing short of horrifying,\u201d said Rege Riley, national commander of American Veterans, known as AmVets. He called on VA Secretary Robert Wilkie to \u201ctake swift and transparent action to fix this.\u201d\n\nVeterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America and Vietnam Veterans of America joined AmVets and the Legion in calling for action. Together, the groups are known as the \u201cbig six\u201d and wield considerable clout in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe VA must address and correct these issues,\u201d said Garry Augustine, executive director of Disabled American Veterans.\n\nVA 'striving to improve'\n\nVA spokesman Curt Cashour said the residents the VA typically cares for are sicker than those in private nursing homes, making \u201cachieving good quality ratings more challenging.\u201d He said that overall, VA nursing homes \u201ccompare well\u201d with the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to briefing each of these groups in the near future regarding these crucial facts,\u201d Cashour said, adding that the VA is \u201ccontinuously striving to improve all of its health care facilities.\u201d\n\nThe VA has 133 nursing homes across the country that serve 46,000 veterans annually.\n\nNewly released VA data show that 95 of them \u2013 about 71 percent \u2013 scored worse than private nursing homes on a majority of quality indicators, such as rates of infection, serious pain and bed sores.\n\nRoughly the same number, 93, received only one or two stars out of five for quality in the agency\u2019s own ratings.\n\nIn a scathing statement declaring those facilities \u201cfailures,\u201d VFW National Commander Vincent \u201cB.J.\u201d Lawrence said the VA \u201cmust improve its delivery of quality care at these facilities.\u201d\n\n\"(Veterans') families deserve to know that their loved ones \u2013 their heroes \u2013 are not being abandoned or abused, and America needs to be reassured that the VA is honoring our nation's promise to those who have borne the battle,\" he said.\n\nCall for transparency\n\nReistad, the Legion's commander, added, \u201cWe not only expect VA to fix these problems immediately, but we want transparency.\u201d On Sunday, after his group met with VA officials, he said he is confident they will work with the Legion and the other groups to \u201cinstitute needed improvements.\u201d\n\nThe VA released the quality information on its nursing homes only after learning in June that USA TODAY and the Globe planned to publish it. The agency still has not released the results of inspections.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Rick Weidman, co-founder of Vietnam Veterans of America. He said his group often has to \u201cfight like hell with VA in order to get information.\u201d\n\nThe reports can include instances of neglect or poor conditions that can be a tip-off to current and prospective residents about problems at a facility.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how veterans are best served by the VA not being open about the level of care it\u2019s providing,\u201d AmVets spokesman John Hoellwarth said.\n\nCashour said the VA is working with an outside contractor who conducts the inspections, Wisconsin-based Long Term Care Institute, to remove patient information from its reports before they are released, maybe by the end of the year.\n\nPrivate nursing homes have three years\u2019 worth of inspection reports posted on a federal website, Nursing Home Compare.\n\nLawmakers demand answers\n\nIn September, Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law legislation requiring the VA to publish quality ratings going forward. The law does not mention inspection reports.\n\nThe Republican-led House VA Committee launched an investigation of VA nursing home care after the initial USA TODAY and Globe reports, but a spokeswoman, Molly Jenkins, said the probe won\u2019t be finished in time to hold a hearing this year as anticipated. The Democrat poised to take over the committee in January, Rep. Mark Takano of California, said it is a \u201ccritical issue that will continue to be a priority.\u201d\n\nIn Massachusetts, home to two, one-star VA nursing homes \u2013 in Bedford and Brockton \u2013 lawmakers are demanding to know what steps the VA has taken to improve patient care there and at other facilities around the country.\n\n\u201cThe continued care lapses at VA facilities raise questions about whether concrete, lasting measures are being implemented to prevent misconduct from occurring again \u2013 or whether certain VA facilities are unable to institute changes necessary to provide our veterans with the care befitting their service to the country,\u201d Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats from Massachusetts, wrote in a letter to Wilkie.\n\nThey demanded the most recent report from the Long Term Care Institute inspection of the Brockton VA nursing home.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can\u2019t treat Americans who put their lives on the line with dignity when their lives are on the line here at home later in life is disgusting,\u201d said Rep.

Trump added that bin Laden was on his radar before the 9/11 attacks.\n\nHe blamed Bill Clinton for missing \u201chis shot\u201d at bin Laden, an apparent reference to a 1998 cruise missile strike launched by the Clinton administration in response to the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa that same year.

The toxin can cause difficulty breathing, paralysis, and even death. Honey might contain bacteria that produce the toxin in the intestine of infants that consume it, according to health officials.\n\nBy the time children are 12 months old, health officials say they have developed enough other types of bacteria in their digestive tract to prevent the botulism bacteria from growing and producing toxin.\n\nOn Friday, DSHS also issued a health alert asking healthcare providers to watch for cases of infant botulism and remind parents not to let babies eat honey. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics have long advised that children under 12 months old should not consume honey.\n\nMore: Sucking on your infant's pacifier could protect against allergies, research says\n\nAccording to a press release from the department, honey-filled pacifiers are not commonly sold in the United States, but might be available in some specialty stores and online retailers. Although most of the products are not designed for the honey to be consumed, some have reportedly had a small hole, so a child could eat the honey, or the pacifier could accidentally rupture or leak.\n\nParents should also avoid pacifiers containing any other food substance, because they could also pose a risk of botulism, DSHS said.\n\nTexas has reported seven to eight cases of infant botulism annually in recent years.

Bennett threatened to bolt the government if he wasn\u2019t named defense minister, a post Netanyahu said Sunday he was taking over himself.\n\nNetanyahu has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the cease-fire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class, rocket-battered towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his Likud Party.\n\nBut in an impassioned speech Sunday announcing his new role as defense minister, Netanyahu sought to brandish his security credentials in the face of the criticism while pinning blame on his coalition partners for trying to force early elections during a sensitive time for Israel\u2019s security.\n\nHe repeated the claim Monday, saying it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d to dissolve the government and call early elections amid a tense security situation.\n\nNetanyahu would have entered any campaign weakened by the recent Gaza flare-up but heartened by the lack of any real challenger to his leadership.\n\nCLOSE Palestinian militants on Monday fired dozens of rockets and mortar shells into southern Israel, critically wounding an Israeli teen in what appeared to be an act of revenge after a deadly undercover Israeli military raid the day before. (Nov. 12) AP\n\nMost opinion polls, including those after the crisis began, show Netanyahu easily securing re-election, which would grant him a place in Israeli history as the country\u2019s longest serving leader.\n\nAccording to polls, the political map would not change much from the current one, where one of Israel\u2019s most hard-line governments faces a fragmented opposition unable to pose a serious challenge.\n\nBut Netanyahu may find a challenge to his rule from other corners, including a potential corruption indictment that could knock him out of contention.\n\nPolice have recommended he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases and have questioned him at length on another. The country has been eagerly awaiting the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether to press charges.\n\nNetanyahu has angrily dismissed the accusations against him, characterizing them as part of a media-orchestrated witch-hunt that is obsessed with removing him from office.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/19/israel-avoids-early-elections-coalition-kept-intact/2052806002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Pamela Anderson slams Australian prime minister for 'smutty,' sexist comments", "description": "The prime minister said he had \"plenty of mates who have asked me if they can be my special envoy to sort out the issue with Pamela.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/19/pamela-anderson-slams-australian-prime-minister-smutty-comments/2052881002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/49f97a0fc23be59d1fb9746e4ba21ca0f2354377/c=0-102-3000-1797/local/-/media/2018/03/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/636574010725312149-GTY-936709032.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T12:21:36Z", "content": "Melania Trump seems to be ditching her expensive fur coats.

On top of that, Washburn, a potter, operates on a small budget.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a freelance artist, so my income is pretty tight,\u201d she says.\n\nShe buys small presents from local artisans or makes coffee mugs, ornaments, plates or bowls in a ceramics studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, for friends and family, who have come to expect the homemade gifts, she says with a laugh.\n\n\u201cBut I do wish people would take a step back and care less about the gifts,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we can come together, eat dinner and play Secret Santa, that\u2019s fun and it forces you to enjoy each other\u2019s time rather than show what you can afford.\u201d\n\nWashburn\u2019s experience is not uncommon. Instead of joy and generosity of spirit portrayed in holiday movies, the yuletide season often comes with emotional and financial stress as people navigate budgets, family expectations and guilt.\n\nAmericans are expected to spend an average $1,007 this holiday season, a 4 percent increase from last year, according to the National Retail Federation. Almost two-thirds of that spending \u2013 or $638 \u2013 will be on gifts. That's a stretch for many household budgets. Here are how some families across the country are working around that.\n\nRe-gift with purpose\n\nEarlier this year, Kay Rodriguez left her corporate job to focus on travel, full-time blogging and simplifying her life. This holiday season, she wants her new values reflected in the gifts she gives her family.\n\n\u201cInstead of buying things that my family may or may not use, I went to my closet to see what I could repurpose for someone who would appreciate it more than I do,\u201d says Rodriquez, 25.\n\n\u201cBut I do wish people would take a step back and care less about the gifts.\u201d Stephanie Washburn\n\nHer younger sister, who just graduated from college and is about to start working in management consulting, doesn't have much business attire. But Rodriguez does, and it\u2019s gathering dust after her career change. So, she's picked out some of her favorite pieces, plans to dry clean them and wrap them up for her sister. (Don\u2019t worry, her sister already knows!)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited for her,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cNow she has some basic pieces instead of spending hundreds of dollars she doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nMore: Gas prices plummet amid 'bewildering' decline for oil as Thanksgiving travel approaches\n\nMore: You want to save money by eating at home.

It\u2019s a tradition she introduced to her family two years ago after they had moved to Washington, D.C. On Christmas morning, the family received a box with envelopes for a scavenger hunt Rodriguez set up for the following day.\n\nThe hunt took them to new areas of D.C. they hadn\u2019t visited, as well as the Newseum and The Hamilton, a trendy restaurant. The day ended at the St. Regis Hotel, where Rodriguez booked a suite for the family using Starwood rewards she earned traveling for her job.\n\nKay Rodriguez (left) sits with her sister, Ellie (middle), and her mother, Carmen (right), in the St. Regis Hotel in Washington D.C.

Most important, they spent the day together exploring their new city.\n\n\u201cAt first, when they got the gift, I think my sister was unimpressed,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cAt the end of the day, she said, \u2018this is cool, we should do it every year\u2019 and posted it to Instagram.\u201d\n\nGetting away together\n\nIn a similar vein, Monica L. Dwyer, a certified financial planner in West Chester, Ohio, suggested last year that instead of her mom buying gifts for everyone, she should treat them to a family vacation on Oak Island in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe looked on Airbnb, and it would cost her the same to rent the house for a week as it did for her to buy Christmas presents,\u201d Dwyer says. Another perk of her plan was that Dwyer\u2019s brother and sister-in-law were on a tight budget, so vacations were out of the question unless they had some financial help.\n\n\u201cFrom Christmas until June, my sister-in-law and brother were talking about the vacation the entire time,\u201d says Dwyer, who notes that the time together turned into a great bonding experience. \u201cAnd my mother said it was the most stress-free Christmas she ever had.\u201d\n\nStart the conversation\n\nWhether your budget is thin or you want to try something new, be upfront with your family.

Time\n\nNissan CEO Carlos Ghosn waves as he leaves No. 10 Downing St. in central London (Photo: Niklas Halle'n, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nJapanese automaker Nissan Motor Co.'s influential chairman Carlos Ghosn was fired and arrested Monday after an internal probe found he underreported his salary and for other financial violations, including the personal use of company assets, the firm and Japanese state media said.\n\nNissan said in a statement that Ghosn would be dismissed after an internal probe based on a whistleblower report found he falsified reports \"over many years.\"\n\nJapan's state broadcaster NHK said Ghosn was later arrested Monday on suspicion of financial misconduct. The news was announced after Japan\u2019s financial markets closed, meaning Nissan's Japan-listed stock price was not immediately affected.\n\nHowever, shares in French carmaker Renault, Nissan's longtime partner, fell 14 percent in European trading, to 55.61 euros \u2013 the largest drop in over three years.\n\nBrazilian-born Ghosn, 64, is a huge figure in the global auto industry. He was an early advocate for electric cars, autonomous and driverless vehicles, and for integrating communication capabilities with smartphone technology for the \"connected car.\"\n\nGhosn helped turn around Renault and Nissan and pushed them into electric cars. Ghosn is chairman and CEO of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance and CEO of Renault.\n\nOver a decade ago, Ghosn was a central figure in a proposed three-way alliance between General Motors, Renault and Nissan. The failed globe-spanning partnership would have created the world's largest carmaker, currently Germany's Volkswagen.\n\nRenault was not available for comment on the allegations.\n\nAnother senior Nissan executive, American Greg Kelly, was also dismissed. Neither Ghosn nor Kelly could be reached directly for comment.\n\n\"The investigation showed that over many years both Ghosn and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn's compensation,\" Nissan said in its statement. \"Also, in regards to Ghosn, numerous other significant acts of misconduct have been uncovered, such as personal use of company assets, and Kelly's deep involvement has also been confirmed.\"\n\nThe fall for Ghosn, whose charisma, globe-trotting persona and industry gravitas once inspired a Japanese manga comic book about him, left the auto industry gasping.\n\n\"Ghosn is a giant in the industry,\" said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Cox Automotive\u2019s Autotrader. \"He\u2019s a giant on the global business stage.\"\n\nAlthough investors were concerned Ghosn\u2019s dismissal could mean Nissan faces financial problems, Sanford Bernstein auto analyst Max Warburton said it\u2019s more likely the accusations pertain to Ghosn\u2019s personal conduct.\n\nAs a leader of three companies at once, Ghosn successfully pressed the global alliance of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi to challenge Volkswagen Group and Toyota Motor for the title as the world\u2019s largest automaker. He promoted collaboration among the alliance partners to save on vehicle costs.\n\nIn doing so, he entertained the prospect of an outright merger at one point, but political realities made it infeasible, he eventually concluded. Among them: The French government owns a large stake in Renault and is unlikely to cede control to the shareholders of more-profitable Nissan.\n\nNow, with Ghosn \"defenestrated,\" the alliance\u2019s future is suddenly in jeopardy, Warburton wrote in an investor note Monday.\n\n\"It is hard not to conclude that there may be a gulf opening up between Renault and Nissan. Perhaps the Alliance will be fine without Ghosn \u2013 his importance may be overstated. Or perhaps it will come apart at the seams.\"\n\nOne of Ghosn\u2019s signature moves was his aggressive pursuit of sales volume, sometimes at the expense of profitability and quality. He wanted to make Nissan one of the largest automakers in the U.S., but his successor as CEO of the Japanese automaker, the recently installed Hiroto Saikawa, publicly questioned the brand\u2019s strategy of heavily discounting vehicles for Americans.\n\nStill, few questioned Ghosn\u2019s industry leadership, especially when he cast a vision to make Nissan the world\u2019s leader in electric vehicles, starting with the battery-powered Nissan Leaf.\n\nWhich is why it was such a shock when Nissan lost the electric-car crown to Silicon Valley\u2019s Tesla and to General Motors.\n\n\"He had this vision for being extremely aggressive in electric vehicles,\u201d Krebs said, of Cox Automotive\u2019s Autotrader. \"It just has not taken hold.\"\n\nMore: Toyota, Nissan, Ford car sales plummet as SUVs reign\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/11/19/nissans-carlos-ghosn-fired-faces-arrest-over-income-reports/2052811002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "ShowBiz Minute: Bieber, Governors Awards, US Box Office", "description": "Justin Bieber, Hailey Baldwin confirm marriage on Instagram; A few honorary Oscars firsts at this year's Governors Awards; \"Fantastic Beasts\" flies to top of weekend box office in U.S. and Canada.

(Photo: Kelsey Cronin for The Boston Globe)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Six veterans\u2019 groups are calling on the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve the quality of care at its nursing homes following a story by USA TODAY and The Boston Globe detailing \u201cblatant disregard for veteran safety\u201d at a VA nursing home in Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cAnybody who respects veterans should be angered by this,\u201d American Legion National Commander Brett Reistad said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s veterans deserve better.\u201d\n\nThe groups, who together represent nearly 5 million members, said veterans who risked their lives for our country shouldn\u2019t have to risk their lives in VA nursing homes.\n\nIn Brockton, Massachusetts, investigators found two nurses asleep during their shifts, even though the facility knew it was under scrutiny and inspectors were coming to visit, looking for potential signs of patient neglect. A whistleblower had reported that nurses and aides did not empty the bedside urinals of frail veterans, they failed to provide clean water at night and didn\u2019t check on the veterans regularly. The VA said the napping nurses no longer work at the facility.\n\nThe story was the latest in an investigation by USA TODAY and the Globe that revealed care at many VA nursing facilities was worse than at private nursing homes in the agency\u2019s own internal ratings, kept secret from veterans for years.\n\nThe stories detailed disturbing examples of substandard care \u2013 a veteran with undiagnosed scabies for months, another struggling to eat in Bedford, Massachussetts; and a third sitting for hours in soiled sheets and another writhing in pain without medication in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nA Navy veteran was declared dead after he walked out of a supposedly secure VA nursing home and was never found in Tuskegee, Alabama. An Army vet landed in intensive care suffering from malnutrition, septic shock and bed sores after a stay at a VA nursing home in Livermore, California.\n\n\u201cThe stories being reported about the treatment of some individual veterans at these facilities are nothing short of horrifying,\u201d said Rege Riley, national commander of American Veterans, known as AmVets. He called on VA Secretary Robert Wilkie to \u201ctake swift and transparent action to fix this.\u201d\n\nVeterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America and Vietnam Veterans of America joined AmVets and the Legion in calling for action. Together, the groups are known as the \u201cbig six\u201d and wield considerable clout in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe VA must address and correct these issues,\u201d said Garry Augustine, executive director of Disabled American Veterans.\n\nVA 'striving to improve'\n\nVA spokesman Curt Cashour said the residents the VA typically cares for are sicker than those in private nursing homes, making \u201cachieving good quality ratings more challenging.\u201d He said that overall, VA nursing homes \u201ccompare well\u201d with the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to briefing each of these groups in the near future regarding these crucial facts,\u201d Cashour said, adding that the VA is \u201ccontinuously striving to improve all of its health care facilities.\u201d\n\nThe VA has 133 nursing homes across the country that serve 46,000 veterans annually.\n\nNewly released VA data show that 95 of them \u2013 about 71 percent \u2013 scored worse than private nursing homes on a majority of quality indicators, such as rates of infection, serious pain and bed sores.\n\nRoughly the same number, 93, received only one or two stars out of five for quality in the agency\u2019s own ratings.\n\nIn a scathing statement declaring those facilities \u201cfailures,\u201d VFW National Commander Vincent \u201cB.J.\u201d Lawrence said the VA \u201cmust improve its delivery of quality care at these facilities.\u201d\n\n\"(Veterans') families deserve to know that their loved ones \u2013 their heroes \u2013 are not being abandoned or abused, and America needs to be reassured that the VA is honoring our nation's promise to those who have borne the battle,\" he said.\n\nCall for transparency\n\nReistad, the Legion's commander, added, \u201cWe not only expect VA to fix these problems immediately, but we want transparency.\u201d On Sunday, after his group met with VA officials, he said he is confident they will work with the Legion and the other groups to \u201cinstitute needed improvements.\u201d\n\nThe VA released the quality information on its nursing homes only after learning in June that USA TODAY and the Globe planned to publish it. The agency still has not released the results of inspections.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Rick Weidman, co-founder of Vietnam Veterans of America. He said his group often has to \u201cfight like hell with VA in order to get information.\u201d\n\nThe reports can include instances of neglect or poor conditions that can be a tip-off to current and prospective residents about problems at a facility.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how veterans are best served by the VA not being open about the level of care it\u2019s providing,\u201d AmVets spokesman John Hoellwarth said.\n\nCashour said the VA is working with an outside contractor who conducts the inspections, Wisconsin-based Long Term Care Institute, to remove patient information from its reports before they are released, maybe by the end of the year.\n\nPrivate nursing homes have three years\u2019 worth of inspection reports posted on a federal website, Nursing Home Compare.\n\nLawmakers demand answers\n\nIn September, Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law legislation requiring the VA to publish quality ratings going forward. The law does not mention inspection reports.\n\nThe Republican-led House VA Committee launched an investigation of VA nursing home care after the initial USA TODAY and Globe reports, but a spokeswoman, Molly Jenkins, said the probe won\u2019t be finished in time to hold a hearing this year as anticipated. The Democrat poised to take over the committee in January, Rep. Mark Takano of California, said it is a \u201ccritical issue that will continue to be a priority.\u201d\n\nIn Massachusetts, home to two, one-star VA nursing homes \u2013 in Bedford and Brockton \u2013 lawmakers are demanding to know what steps the VA has taken to improve patient care there and at other facilities around the country.\n\n\u201cThe continued care lapses at VA facilities raise questions about whether concrete, lasting measures are being implemented to prevent misconduct from occurring again \u2013 or whether certain VA facilities are unable to institute changes necessary to provide our veterans with the care befitting their service to the country,\u201d Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats from Massachusetts, wrote in a letter to Wilkie.\n\nThey demanded the most recent report from the Long Term Care Institute inspection of the Brockton VA nursing home.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can\u2019t treat Americans who put their lives on the line with dignity when their lives are on the line here at home later in life is disgusting,\u201d said Rep.

(Photo: Charles Dharapak, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 One in five Army generals could not deploy in 2016 for medical reasons, according to data obtained by USA TODAY, a troubling finding regarding the military's readiness to fight that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has vowed to fix.\n\nOverdue medical and dental exams were the primary reasons for what the Army refers to as medical readiness in 2016. The medical readiness rate for generals has improved to nearly 85 percent, according to Brig. Gen. Omar Jones, the Army's top spokesman. Almost all generals, 97.4 percent, can now deploy after taking care of minor issues such as having updated blood tests and dental exams.\n\n\"The Army's top priority is readiness and soldiers are expected to be world-wide deployable to ensure our Army is ready to fight today and in the future,\" Jones said. \"The data from 2016 does not reflect recent improvements in medical readiness for the Army as a whole and for the general officer corps specifically.\"\n\nThe data were contained in a June 2017 report on the state of the Army's general officer corps that was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The study was commissioned after a series of high-profile scandals involving generals and admirals came to light. In 2014, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel created an office to investigate ethical problems among senior leaders. An investigation by USA TODAY last year found that military investigators had documented at least 500 cases of serious misconduct among its generals, admirals and senior civilians, almost half of those instances involving personal or ethical lapses.\n\nOne of the most recent cases involved Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Tibbets, who was fired for making sexually suggestive comments to women and failing to report suicide attempts among airmen in his command.\n\nMost of the Army's 2017 report released to USA TODAY was redacted. However, sections that included data on deployability for generals and programs to improve their mental and physical health were included. It noted \"Points of Stress\" for generals that include combat, deployment, family separation, loss and uncertainty. Another category termed, \"Complicators,\" listed aging, caring for parents, disease risk and teenagers.\n\nData for 2016 showed that 83.5 percent of Army soldiers were deemed medically ready to deploy, the lowest rate among the services. The Marine Corps led with 90.2 percent followed by the Navy at 90.1 percent and the Air Force at 88.8 percent. The rate for active-duty, ready-to-deploy generals, not including the Reserve or National Guard, was 79.6 percent. For active-duty soldiers overall, the figure was 84 percent, and the Army's goal is 85 percent.\n\nThe top factors for failing to meet the standard was being overdue for an annual physical or dental exam, a relatively easy fix. The report included a recommendation to \"Enforce Wellness\" that enables generals to receive the evaluations and treatment they needed and \"ensure that they do so.\"\n\nTo that end, the Army has sent 62 generals to its executive health program at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, Jones said. Over a three-day period, generals receive health-care services and assessments. By the end of 2019, 234 more generals will have been through the program.\n\nJones noted that gains had been made and are reflected in the medical readiness for generals, which is now 84.7 percent.\n\nMattis took office in January 2017, and this year served notice that he was making readiness to fight a top priority for the Pentagon.\n\nIf troops can't deploy, Mattis said, others must take their place. The burden of combat and time away from family falls unevenly, he said. Exceptions are made for those wounded in combat or injured in accidents.\n\n\"But this is a deployable military,\" Mattis told reporters in February. \"It's a lethal military that aligns with our allies and partners. If you can't go overseas in your combat load \u2013 carry a combat load, then obviously someone else has got to go.

John Nicholson, at the time the top commander of troops in Afghanistan. Nicholson uses the \"2/3/7\" rule. He asks each of his leaders to spend two hours a day alone, eat three meals and sleep for at least seven hours a night.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/19/one-five-army-generals-were-not-cleared-combat-2016/2029702002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Bryan Alexander, USA TODAY", "title": "Governors Awards bring out legends: All the moments you missed at the honorary Oscars", "description": "Clint Eastwood started his own talk show from stage, while icon Cicely Tyson stirred the emotions at the Governors Awards Sunday night.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/19/governors-awards-honorary-oscars-2018/2052366002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/cb06b0d7-ba7f-4e1c-a2db-9840814b5bd3-AFP_AFP_1AY3TS.JPG?crop=3269,1828,x0,y216&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:47:56Z", "content": "Cicely Tyson accepts an honorary Oscar at the 10th Annual Governors Awards gala.

The podium talk session went well between the two, who have collaborated on eight films.\n\n\"You got this guy right here, you can take him home. You can go around and show people. Put it on the front of your car,\" said Eastwood, looking at Schifrin's Oscar. \"What do you think?\"\n\n\"Well, it\u2019s been really nice talking to you,\" Schifrin said, earning a big laugh.\n\nMore: Clint Eastwood loathes taking fan selfies: 'It's a pain in the rear'\n\n\"Here you go,\" Eastwood said, handing over the trophy. \"Do you have anything you want to say?\"\n\nSchifrin did make a serious speech, calling the award a \"culmination of a dream.

Tyson, who turns 94 next month, brought the audience to tears with her emotional acceptance speech.\n\n\"The Help\" and \"Diary of A Mad Black Woman\" star talked about her first Oscar nomination 45 years ago for \"Sounder\" and how she yearned to show her stern mother she had made it as an actress.\n\nBefore her mother died, she told Tyson she was proud.\n\n\"I think if I had not heard those words from her, none of this would make a difference to me,\" said Tyson, showing off her trophy to the heavens. \"I know you didn\u2019t want me to do this.

(Photo: Michael Mercer/@coda_visual)\n\nAmericans will spend more than a $1,000 this holiday season, with almost two-thirds of the money going toward gifts, according to the National Retail Federation. That's a stretch for many household budgets.\n\nIf this year\u2019s holiday gift exchange is stressing your finances and emotions, consider these three gift-giving ideas that provide meaningful presents or create new festive traditions.\n\nGive yourself\n\nInstead of a thing, put together an experience for your loved ones. Consider the promise of taking a family member or friend to a sporting event, concert or even on a small vacation. A future outing also allows you to save up for it.\n\nOr, try gifting your time and effort. For instance, promise nieces and nephews a trip to a museum and lunch, says Eric Roberge, a certified financial planner in Boston. \u201cTheir parents may even appreciate that more than getting even more toys their kids don't need,\u201d he says.\n\nFor older family members, offer to do yard work or other chores each month that may be difficult for them. Donate time to run errands or babysit for adult siblings with young children.\n\nGift with love, not money\n\nFind meaningful presents hidden in your own closet or attic. Consider re-gifting jewelry and other special family heirlooms to older nieces and nephews. Little cousins would love old Lego sets, Barbie dolls and other toys your children have outgrown.\n\nCommit to only small, thoughtful gifts presented with a handwritten card. Find one small item such as a fancy hand lotion or book that you personally love and buy one for each family member.\n\nIf you\u2019re crafty or good in the kitchen, consider handmade items or freshly baked cookies or candies. Gather your best family recipes in a photo book for newlyweds in the family.\n\nPlay a game\n\nFamilies can play Secret Santa to simplify gift giving and reduce spending, says Paul Fain, a certified financial planner in Knoxville, Tennessee. Cookie or ornament exchanges can be fun, festive and frugal. Or, bring out the friendly competition by playing Yankee Swap,White Elephant or Dirty Santa.\n\nFain\u2019s family one year drew names and then went to Target with a $20 limit. \u201cI still wear the Avengers t-shirt my son bought me,\u201d he says.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/19/holiday-budgeting-tips-3-ways-spend-less-christmas-gifts/2026426002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jori Epstein, USA TODAY", "title": "'The only way sometimes is over the top': Inside NFL players' art of hurdling defenders", "description": "NFL stars Todd Gurley, Ezekiel Elliott and Saquon Barkley have  hurdled defenders.

In fact, the Bengals\u2019 rookie safety out of Wake Forest wasn\u2019t even the first line of defense against the Chiefs running back with 8:32 to go in the first quarter of Cincinnati\u2019s Week 7 loss to Kansas City.\n\nBut when Hunt spun out of Bengals cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick\u2019s tackle, he charged forward, broke two tackles and leaped over Bates.\n\nBates\u2019 Wake Forest group text lit up after the game.\n\n\u201cHey Jessie,\u201d Bates told USA TODAY Sports one friend wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re a human hurdle now?\u201d\n\nHunt smiled when he heard the jab.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s just an instinct,\u201d the second-year running back said. \u201cThe only way sometimes is over top.\u201d\n\nRunning backs across the league agree.\n\nRookie first-round running backs the last four years have wowed with highlight reels of hurdles, from the Rams\u2019 Todd Gurley in 2015, to the Cowboys\u2019 Ezekiel Elliott in 2016, the Panthers\u2019 Christian McCaffrey in 2017 and now the Giants\u2019 Saquon Barkley.\n\nMonday night, two of the league\u2019s most prominent hurdlers in Gurley and Hunt face off with their high-octane, 9-1 offenses in Los Angeles.\n\nDefenses, beware.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge,\u201d said Cowboys safety Jeff Heath, who caught Gurley mid-hurdle last season. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole other way they can make you miss.\u201d\n\nRams running back Todd Gurley (30) tries to hurdle Dallas safety Jeff Heath (38) in a 2017 game. (Photo: Tim Heitman, Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cIt makes you second guess on how to tackle them,\u201d said Chiefs safety Ron Parker, who will keep his eyes peeled for Gurley on Monday. \u201cIf it do happen, you just like can\u2019t believe it happened to you.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe he\u2019s trying to hurdle you.\u201d\n\nBut frequently, league stars are.\n\nHurdlers often say their decision is spontaneous, but they identified a few catalysts that can encourage them to jump.\n\nBarkley studies how low defenders tackle during film review. Elliott seeks out one-on-one matchups when the chance drops that he\u2019ll be tackled midair or on landing. Hunt hits top speeds that preclude a juke or cut, and crowded lanes when, as he said, the only clear way is up.\n\n\u201cYou picture people like Saquon, Zeke \u2013 they\u2019re thicker guys,\u201d Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cDBs get tired of tackling those guys.\u201d\n\nThe muscle memory is there, says Hunt, from early hurdling days. Take Elliott, who began hurdling on the track team in middle school. His mom hurdled in college at Missouri. In high school, he won state titles in the 110-meter and 300-meter hurdles.\n\n\u201cEzekiel was, right off, just natural,\u201d his mom Dawn Elliott told USA TODAY Sports by phone.\n\nBut through middle school, high school and two years at Ohio State, Elliott limited his hurdles to the track. He told Dawn repeatedly he wanted to hurdle a person. As a junior on the Ohio State gridiron, he finally did.\n\nHunt and Barkley each hurdled defenders as early as high school, with Barkley\u2019s first jump landing in the end zone.\n\nThis season, Barkley has hurdled defenders from the Saints, Eagles, Jaguars and 49ers. Hunt jumped Bates with the Bengals and, three weeks later, Broncos safety Will Parks for six points. Elliott hurdled Eagles rookie Tre Sullivan in a division matchup Nov. 9. The acrobatics took the Cowboys from the 40 yard line to the Eagles\u2019 8, setting up a field goal to send the Cowboys ahead 6-3.\n\nDawn\u2019s phone blew up, texts \u201crolling\u201d in.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Wow,\u2019\u201d Dawn said. \u201cThen they kept showing the replay and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t believe this kid.\u2019\u201d\n\nNeither did Cowboys pass-rushing great DeMarcus Ware.\n\n\u201cI told Zeke he needs to stop jumping,\u201d Ware said. \u201cWe need him the whole season.\n\n\u201cBut if he can do those things and make those big plays, that\u2019s the reason why they brought him in here \u2013 to move those chains.\u201d\n\nHurdling, as Ware worries, invites danger.\n\nBarkley\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t like when he hurdles; Hunt\u2019s family tells him they \u201cdon\u2019t want me to do it that much.\u201d Dawn Elliott says she gets nervous, though Zeke insists she\u2019s more \u201cone of those moms who\u2019s like, eh, rub some dirt on it.\u201d\n\nThen there are the offensive linemen.\n\nIt\u2019s impressive, Cowboys center Travis Frederick (who is out with an illness) and Chiefs right tackle Mitch Schwartz say. But \u201cthose are people that are our charges to protect,\u201d Frederick adds. \u201cWe cringe a bit.\u201d\n\nDefenders are beginning to anticipate the move, reminding each other to tackle strong and hit with solid technique against the heavier backs who can escape from arm tackles like Hunt did vs. Cincinnati.\n\nBates jokes he\u2019s \u201c0 for 1\u201d all time vs. NFL hurdlers thanks to Hunt, though in college he did grab a leaping Tulane back\u2019s foot and trip him.\n\nHunt learned what that felt like last week against Arizona, when Cardinals safety Budda Baker reacted quickly enough to essentially body-slam him in midair, limiting Hunt to 6 yards on 2nd-and-16, forcing the Chiefs to punt on the drive.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t never been caught before like that,\u201d Hunt told Baker after the play, impressed. \u201cYou watched film.\u201d\n\nThen Baker told Hunt not to try it again, Hunt said, laughing, \u201ctalking his little smack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got it, you won,\u201d Hunt responded.\n\nBut not trying it again?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d Hunt said.\n\nFollow Jori Epstein on Twitter: @JoriEpstein\n\nContributing: Trysta Krick and Art Stapleton"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Lorenzo Reyes, USA TODAY", "title": "NFL Week 11 winners, losers: Cowboys save their season, Jaguars are major disappointment", "description": "While the Dallas Cowboys are now in NFC East title contention, the Minnesota Vikings have an uphill battle to get back into the NFC North race.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/19/nfl-week-11-winners-losers-dallas-cowboys-nfc-east-contention/2052596002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/d41a1b6e-d129-429f-b4f3-3b6bbafaa1f7-USATSI_11693874.jpg?crop=3114,1752,x201,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:12:12Z", "content": "Ezekiel Elliott celebrates with teammates after a touchdown run against the Falcons.

(Photo: Brett Davis, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThough the jewel of Week 11 \u2014 a fascinating matchup of two 9-1 teams in the Chiefs and the Rams \u2014 would have to wait for Monday night, there was still plenty of action to sort through in Week 11.\n\nOn Sunday, there were four division games, nine games decided by one score, six second-half comebacks, plenty of touchdowns, and one devastating injury that could sink a team\u2019s playoff hopes. But since no team in the league has clinched a playoff spot yet, the stakes remain high across the NFL with a month and a half of regular season left to play.\n\nHere are the winners and losers from Sunday\u2019s slate of games.\n\nWinners\n\nDallas Cowboys: They might have just saved their season. The Cowboys battled back on the road to topple the Falcons, 22-19, on a game-winning field goal. Now, they sit at 5-5 and in second place in the NFC East. And, if they beat the Redskins on Thanksgiving, they\u2019ll be tied atop the division. But even though Dallas won its pivotal game, it still has plenty to improve upon. The passing game, even with Amari Cooper (three catches for 36 yards), remains quite pedestrian. And, though unfortunate it might be (and more on that later), but a significant injury to a division foe could end up helping the Cowboys.\n\nAndrew Luck: Forget comeback player of the year, the Colts' quarterback is playing his way into the MVP conversation after yet another sterling performance in a 38-10 beating of the Titans. It was such a thorough domination that the Colts rested Luck with more than 10 minutes to play in the fourth quarter with the game out of hand. Luck now has seven consecutive games with at least three passing touchdowns, leaving him within striking distance of the all-time record. He trails only Peyton Manning (eight, in 2004) and Tom Brady (10, in 2007). He also became just the third player \u2014 joining Dan Marino and Aaron Rodgers \u2014 in league history to have at least 160 passing scores through their first 80 career games. And for the fifth game in a row, Indy didn\u2019t allow Luck to get sacked \u2014 a big reason for his resurgence.\n\nSaints defense: Everyone expects New Orleans to light up the scoreboard \u2014 and they did just that in a 48-7 thumping of the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles \u2014 but it might be the team\u2019s defense that truly makes it a legitimate Super Bowl contender. They forced three interceptions and three sacks, and limited the Eagles to just 13 first downs and three-of-10 on third-down conversions. They might give up a lot of points against other high-powered offenses (like 35 in their Week 9 victory against the Rams), but that\u2019s also a product of playing opposite an offense that churns through points and possessions. This is a defense that can shut opponents down.\n\nJoe Flacco: It wasn\u2019t quite the crisp performance Ravens rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson needed to unseat Joe Flacco (hip injury) as Baltimore\u2019s clear starter, but it was a solid debut. Making his first career start, Jackson relied on his legs to help topple the division-rival Bengals, 24-21. Jackson finished with 27 carries \u2014 the most for a quarterback since 1950 \u2014 for 117 yards and completed 13 of 19 throws for 150 yards with one interception. His speed and elusiveness are unique, but Jackson showed he\u2019s too limited as a passer to be relied upon as a week-to-week starter.\n\nLosers\n\nMinnesota Vikings: A slow start and sloppy, turnover-prone play put the Vikings in a hole they couldn\u2019t climb out of. And in a battle for first place in the NFC North, they slipped and let the Bears take command of the division, 25-20. The Vikings (5-4-1) slid into the final playoff spot in the NFC. Pass protection, carelessness with the ball and a dormant rushing game all need to be fixed. The Bears (7-3), meanwhile, now have a nice cushion that puts them in the driver\u2019s seat for the division. Still, a Week 17 rematch in Minnesota could ultimately decide who wins the NFC North, but the path for the Vikings to get there just got a lot harder.\n\nWashington Redskins: It\u2019s bad enough when you\u2019re a team in first place in a wide-open NFC East and lose, 23-21, to the Texans. It\u2019s much worse when your starting quarterback, Alex Smith, breaks his tibia and fibula and requires immediate surgery, ending his season. That means Washington \u2014 unless they add a veteran free agent \u2014 will try to reach the playoffs with backup Colt McCoy leading the offense. Washington\u2019s (6-4) next three opponents are all division foes, with the next two against the Cowboys (5-5) and Eagles (4-6) coming on the road. And if McCoy doesn\u2019t step up, the team\u2019s postseason hopes could crumble.\n\nDoug Pederson: This was the worst loss of Pederson\u2019s head coaching career and the biggest margin of defeat by a defending Super Bowl champion. The Eagles offense is in disarray and has struggled to start games quickly. Injuries along the offensive line and in the secondary have decimated the depth chart. So, now Pederson needs to \u2014 very quickly \u2014 figure out solutions to solve the various problems (third-down ineptitude, red zone offensive inefficiency are atop the list) facing the team. Philly has lost two in a row and is 2-3 in its last five and the remaining schedule is unforgiving. Missing out on the playoffs is a very real possibility.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: They held a 16-point lead late in the third quarter against a Steelers team they had dominated in recent history, but allowed Pittsburgh to score 20 unanswered to win the game. And now, the Jaguars (3-7) have lost six in a row, are currently the 14th seed \u2014 out of 16 teams \u2014 in the AFC playoff chase, and look like a long shot to play in January. So after last year\u2019s AFC title game appearance, it\u2019s clear that the Jags are one of this season\u2019s most disappointing teams.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Melissa Rorech, Reviewed.com\n\nStephanie Washburn sits with a mug that she created. (Photo: Michael Mercer/@coda_visual)\n\nWhen the holidays roll around, Stephanie Washburn gets anxious.\n\nHer parents have been divorced for a long time, but the 26-year-old still worries about everyone's feelings on both sides when it comes to gift giving and receiving. On top of that, Washburn, a potter, operates on a small budget.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a freelance artist, so my income is pretty tight,\u201d she says.\n\nShe buys small presents from local artisans or makes coffee mugs, ornaments, plates or bowls in a ceramics studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, for friends and family, who have come to expect the homemade gifts, she says with a laugh.\n\n\u201cBut I do wish people would take a step back and care less about the gifts,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we can come together, eat dinner and play Secret Santa, that\u2019s fun and it forces you to enjoy each other\u2019s time rather than show what you can afford.\u201d\n\nWashburn\u2019s experience is not uncommon. Instead of joy and generosity of spirit portrayed in holiday movies, the yuletide season often comes with emotional and financial stress as people navigate budgets, family expectations and guilt.\n\nAmericans are expected to spend an average $1,007 this holiday season, a 4 percent increase from last year, according to the National Retail Federation. Almost two-thirds of that spending \u2013 or $638 \u2013 will be on gifts. That's a stretch for many household budgets. Here are how some families across the country are working around that.\n\nRe-gift with purpose\n\nEarlier this year, Kay Rodriguez left her corporate job to focus on travel, full-time blogging and simplifying her life. This holiday season, she wants her new values reflected in the gifts she gives her family.\n\n\u201cInstead of buying things that my family may or may not use, I went to my closet to see what I could repurpose for someone who would appreciate it more than I do,\u201d says Rodriquez, 25.\n\n\u201cBut I do wish people would take a step back and care less about the gifts.\u201d Stephanie Washburn\n\nHer younger sister, who just graduated from college and is about to start working in management consulting, doesn't have much business attire. But Rodriguez does, and it\u2019s gathering dust after her career change. So, she's picked out some of her favorite pieces, plans to dry clean them and wrap them up for her sister. (Don\u2019t worry, her sister already knows!)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited for her,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cNow she has some basic pieces instead of spending hundreds of dollars she doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nMore: Gas prices plummet amid 'bewildering' decline for oil as Thanksgiving travel approaches\n\nMore: You want to save money by eating at home. But it's really not so easy\n\nMore: 8 ways to use credit-card rewards to stay on budget during the holidays\n\nMemories instead of stuff\n\nIf nothing in her closet works for others on her list, Rodriguez will buy them an experience. It\u2019s a tradition she introduced to her family two years ago after they had moved to Washington, D.C. On Christmas morning, the family received a box with envelopes for a scavenger hunt Rodriguez set up for the following day.\n\nThe hunt took them to new areas of D.C. they hadn\u2019t visited, as well as the Newseum and The Hamilton, a trendy restaurant. The day ended at the St. Regis Hotel, where Rodriguez booked a suite for the family using Starwood rewards she earned traveling for her job.\n\nKay Rodriguez (left) sits with her sister, Ellie (middle), and her mother, Carmen (right), in the St. Regis Hotel in Washington D.C. (Photo: Kay Rodriguez/https://happytohustle.com)\n\nThey sipped champagne and ate chocolate cake. Most important, they spent the day together exploring their new city.\n\n\u201cAt first, when they got the gift, I think my sister was unimpressed,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cAt the end of the day, she said, \u2018this is cool, we should do it every year\u2019 and posted it to Instagram.\u201d\n\nGetting away together\n\nIn a similar vein, Monica L. Dwyer, a certified financial planner in West Chester, Ohio, suggested last year that instead of her mom buying gifts for everyone, she should treat them to a family vacation on Oak Island in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe looked on Airbnb, and it would cost her the same to rent the house for a week as it did for her to buy Christmas presents,\u201d Dwyer says. Another perk of her plan was that Dwyer\u2019s brother and sister-in-law were on a tight budget, so vacations were out of the question unless they had some financial help.\n\n\u201cFrom Christmas until June, my sister-in-law and brother were talking about the vacation the entire time,\u201d says Dwyer, who notes that the time together turned into a great bonding experience. \u201cAnd my mother said it was the most stress-free Christmas she ever had.\u201d\n\nStart the conversation\n\nWhether your budget is thin or you want to try something new, be upfront with your family. Marie Boggs in Sierra Madre, California, turned to Twitter and Instagram to crowdsource new gift-giving traditions for her extended family.\n\n\u201cI was looking to mix it up,\u201d the 46-year-old mother of two said. \u201cAll the nieces and nephews are getting older and are harder to buy for.\u201d\n\nMarie Boggs and her husband Jonathan pose together during last year's holiday season. (Photo: mariecboggs)\n\nShe\u2019s considering a gift card game for the younger set. She\u2019s also hoping to limit the gift giving among the adults on her husband\u2019s side of the family \u2013 and she's got her mother-in-law\u2019s blessing.\n\n\u201cAll the moms are on board,\" she says. \"My mother-in-law and sisters-in-law are dying to make it more simple,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s the guys who want to keep buying gifts. We\u2019re getting together for Thanksgiving, so hopefully we can come up with a better plan.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/19/christmas-gifts-budget-how-avoid-holiday-overspending/2016039002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "By Wine & Food Experience", "title": "Chef and television star Curtis Stone talks food, family and truffles", "description": "Chef Curtis Stone\u2019s restaurants to be featured at the Martha Stewart Wine & Food Experience presented by USA TODAY.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/wine-and-food-experience/2018/11/19/chef-and-television-star-curtis-stone-talks-food-family-and-truffles/2024201002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/ed4fc6ef-1caa-42cd-ae3d-53e2340625be-Curtis_Maude_P_004Photographer_Ray_Kachatorian_cropped.jpg?crop=1641,937,x0,y35&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:00:03Z", "content": "Curtis Stone talks life, family and food.

(Photo: Ray Kachatorian)\n\nChef Curtis Stone\u2019s exuberant personality is recognized in kitchens and on television screens for his many appearances on shows such as Ellen, TODAY, Top Chef Masters, Oprah Winfrey Show and others. In Los Angeles, he oversees two high concept restaurants -- Maude named after his beloved grandmother who, along with his mother Lozza, are his forever inspirations in the kitchen; and Gwen Butcher Shop & Restaurant which he\u2019s opened with his brother, Luke Stone.\n\nHis career spans the Savoy Hotel in Melbourne, Australia to Quo Vadis in London under the watchful eye of his mentor Marco Pierre White. As Head Chef at Quo Vadis, Stone was approached to be featured in a book about London\u2019s finest chefs. A few stints on London morning television followed. He ventured back to his native Australia to cohost TV show Surfing the Menu with good friend Ben O\u2019Donohue, traveling and crafting meals of the fresh foods of local producers. That led to the USA and the show Take Home Chef. Today he\u2019s married to actress Lindsay Price and they\u2019re raising two sons as Stone tends to his dynamic restaurants in Los Angeles.\n\nCLOSE Chef Stone\u2019s amazing restaurants, \"Maude\" and \"Gwen,\" are both featured at the Martha Stewart Wine & Food Experience presented by USA TODAY. USA TODAY\n\nQ&A\n\nWhat\u2019s your morning routine?\n\nCurtis Stone: I\u2019ll wake up before Lindsay and the boys and make myself a cappuccino. If it\u2019s the weekend, we can leisurely make pancakes and juice in our pajamas. If it\u2019s a school/work day, we\u2019ll have a quick brekkie then I may head to the gym for a round of sparring in the boxing ring before heading to one of the restaurants or meetings. There are typically several more cappuccinos pulled throughout the morning.\n\nWhat inspired you to be a chef?\n\nCS: My voracious love for food has always inspired me but it was my grans who brought me into their kitchens. Maude taught be how to make her fudge and is probably how my love of chocolate and sweets was imprinted. I named my first restaurant, Maude, after her. But there are always two grannies, so I followed that up by naming Gwen, my second restaurant that I opened with my older brother Luke, after our other gran.\n\nWho\u2019s your mentor?\n\nCS: Marco Pierre White, hands down. Marco is one of the old guards and ran a tight ship. I waltzed into his kitchen on a day he had just fired someone, was thrown an apron, and put to work. I ended up staying in his kitchens in London for eight years, finally becoming head chef at Quo Vadis.\n\nDescribe your formal training?\n\nCS: Before packing up for Europe, I had an apprenticeship at the Savoy Hotel in Melbourne. I consider eating my way through Europe as part of my formal training as well! Finally, wallet empty and broke, I ended up on the doorstep of Marco and learned so much with him.\n\nWhat do you get out of participating in the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience?\n\nCS: Food festivals are always a great excuse to see your fellow restaurant mates. We\u2019re typically in our own kitchens working our asses off so these events are a great way to try each other\u2019s food and catch up. I started Curtis Stone Events in January and the team has been bringing their A-game to these experiences all year with the same caliber of food and service that we came to be known for at Maude and Gwen.\n\nWhat do you cook at home?\n\nCS: I keep it seasonal and simple at home. It\u2019s a great way to involve by sons, Hudson and Emerson, who are seven and four years old, and like to help in the kitchen. We make pastas and salads and do a lot of grilling in the summer months after a day in the pool. But they are adventurous eaters too and I always encourage them to try new foods. Lindsay is half Korean, so they love a good bulgogi.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite dish?\n\nCS: Anything with truffles. It\u2019s my all-time favorite ingredient. Our first concept at Maude in Beverly Hills was a monthly ten-course tasting menu featuring a seasonal, hero ingredient. We created a new monthly menu for four years straight without repeating an ingredient \u2013 that is except truffles. I insisted that we use black and white truffles each November and December. The dishes changed for each iteration, but that aroma carried across the kitchen and dining room each fall was simply the best.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite holiday dish?\n\nCS: I love my mum\u2019s pork roast and crackling. It\u2019s what I look forward to all year long. But the holidays are an excellent opportunity for more chocolate. (Shrugs).\n\nWhat was the best day in the kitchen?\n\nCS: It depends on the kitchen. If I\u2019m at home, it would start in the garden and picking some fresh veg with the boys and then inviting family and friends over and cooking for them. If I\u2019m at one of the restaurants, we get really excited by finding new flavor combinations and creating new dishes. The restaurants are about creating a beautiful experience for our guests, whether they are celebrating a special occasion or just having a nice night out on the town. Delivering that level of service and seeing sated smiles on guests\u2019 faces is incredibly rewarding.\n\nWho is the coolest person you\u2019ve cooked for?\n\nCS: My wife, Lindsay. What can I say? It\u2019s true.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite food trend happening right now?\n\nCS: I love the theatrics of cooking with live fire. The asador is the focal point of the dining room at Gwen. There is something very primal about starting a fire then cooking over it. All of our meats at Gwen are cooked on a flame in an open kitchen. We\u2019re able to take that to private events now too and the concept inspired the events and catering arm of the business.\n\nTell us something you would like your followers to know about you.\n\nCS: Hide your snacks! I will find your chips, candy, cookies, nuts. There is a joke when I come into the office, drawers open and arms sweep across desks to keep snacks out of my field of vision. Otherwise, there are just crumbs in my wake.\n\nHow do you end your day?\n\nCS: If I\u2019ve been at the restaurants and the boys are already in bed when I get home, I\u2019ll grab a cold beer or a glass of wine. There may be a nibble of chocolate if it\u2019s around, too.\n\nWhat\u2019s the weirdest food combination that you enjoy?\n\nCS: I\u2019m not sure chefs believe in weird food combinations if they work and taste good.\n\nWhat\u2019s the next new concept percolating in your world (What new plans do you have in store?)\n\nCS: We changed the concept at Maude this year. We\u2019re traveling to the world\u2019s greatest wine regions to immerse ourselves in the cuisine, wine, and culture to inspire our quarterly menus. We have a film crew in tow, so you\u2019ll be able to join us soon on the road from your living room!\n\nWhat achievement are you most proud of (awards or recognition or other)?\n\nCS: My marriage and kids. And my first restaurant, Maude.\n\nWhat advice would you give to aspiring chefs?\n\nCS: Work hard, stay humble & respectful, and keep a clean station!\n\nWhat advice would you give to cooks at home?\n\nCS: Keep stress to a minimum. Cooking should be fun. I know sometimes it\u2019s just about getting a meal on the table but asking for help and getting everyone involved and also prepping ahead when you are able, can be the greatest alleviators of cooking fatigue. You can see joy on someone\u2019s face and you can taste it in their food. Keep it light and have a good time when you\u2019re doing it.\n\nChef Stone\u2019s amazing restaurants, Maude and Gwen, are both featured chef at the Martha Stewart Wine & Food Experience presented by USA TODAY on Saturday, Dec. 1 at Los Angeles Center Studio.

He broke up John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil, the Google of its day. He shut down J.P. Morgan\u2019s Northern Securities Co., which would have monopolized rail transportation in much of the United States. And he pursued numerous other cases (45 in all) that broke up monopolies and returned competition to markets.\n\nRoosevelt operated against a Gilded Age background in which a few companies had, by means both fair and foul, eliminated virtually all competition. This was bad for consumers, as it drove prices up. It was also, surprisingly, bad for shareholders: Wu notes that Standard Oil\u2019s value actually increased post-breakup, as it went from inefficient monopoly to a collection of competitive companies. Most of all, it was bad for American society.\n\nMonopolies are an economic and political threat\n\nBig monopolies aren\u2019t just an economic threat: They\u2019re a political threat. Because they\u2019re largely free of market constraints, they don\u2019t have to put all their energy into making a better product for less money. Instead, they put a lot of their energy into political manipulation to protect their monopoly.\n\nAn industry made up of 500 companies might want government protection, but it\u2019s harder to get them to agree on a lobbying campaign. One made up of three companies, or one, can do so, and be sure that it will reap all the rewards of its effort.\n\nThus, as Wu notes, \u201cthe more concentrated the industry, the more corrupt we can expect the political process to be.\u201d And as he points out, these fears (and the realities) of huge companies wielding unchecked political power motivated the antitrust crusaders of a century ago every bit as much as concern about prices.\n\nMore: Break up Facebook: Latest hack proves it's a dangerous monopoly that a fine won't fix.\n\nBreak up the Google-Facebook-Amazon web monopoly\n\nFacebook testimony was less of a reckoning for Big Tech and more of a bump in the road\n\nIn more recent years, a school of antitrust thought inspired by Robert Bork has argued that prices are all we should care about. \u201cConsumer welfare,\u201d this school argues, is all that matters. But even on that measure, monopolies tend to shortchange consumers: If the price isn\u2019t too high (though it usually is) consumers still pay a price in reduced choice or innovation.\n\nToday, things look a lot like Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s era. A few monopolies occupy much of the tech world: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 FANG, as they\u2019re often abbreviated. They gobble up potential competitors, as Facebook did with WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nOne need only look at the recent multicity scramble for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters to see how much power these companies wield: Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man, nonetheless managed to get the state of New York to build him a helipad.\n\nFANG monopolies have even greater control\n\nAnd these new tech monsters have a one-two punch that Standard Oil lacked: Not only do they control immense wealth and important industries, but their fields of operation \u2014 which give them enormous control over communications, including communications about politics \u2014 also give them direct political power that in many ways exceeds that of previous monopolies.\n\nAs Wu writes: \u201cBig tech is ubiquitous, seems to know too much about us, and seems to have too much power over what we see, hear, do, and even feel. It has reignited debates over who really rules, when the decisions of just a few people have great influence over everyone.\u201d\n\nFacing a similar situation, Roosevelt declared, \u201cWhen aggregated wealth demands what is unfair, its immense power can be met only by the still greater power of the people as a whole.\u201d\n\nWith today\u2019s economy dominated by the FANG companies, will Donald Trump \u2014 another brash New Yorker who found himself in the White House \u2014 follow TR\u2019s lead? Perhaps a better question is, why wouldn\u2019t he?\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

Toward the end, they took turns bringing their candles or other mementos from the fire to the altar.\n\n\"We stand with you. We are here to support you in any way we can,\" Jacob Kliebe, a pastor at Calvary Chapel church in Chico, told the crowd gathered in the pews. \"Tonight we just want to grieve with you and to speak words of hope with you.\"\n\nMore: Inside the Camp Fire perimeter, these residents faced the inferno. Now, they're staying put.\n\nMore: The business of wildfires: 'It\u2019s like we\u2019re profiting off a disaster, which is very upsetting'\n\nKliebe said counselors were on hand to help residents work through their grief.\n\nKassy Parish, 19, of Paradise said she found out Saturday that her home burned down in the Camp Fire. She had been so busy helping family and friends that she had little time for grieving, but she found quiet time to reflect during the service.\n\n\"I feel like I have to go through my own grieving process with that,\" Parish said. \"I don't know, how do you grieve a whole town?\"\n\nA lot of people are asking that.\n\nTens of thousands have been left homeless after the fire burned through Paradise, Magalia, Concow and other communities east of Chico.\n\nScores of the displaced are now living in shelters or in tents. Local and state officials have said finding housing for those displaced by the Camp Fire will be difficult and could take months.\n\nOn Sunday night officials announced the Camp Fire death toll has reached 77. The number of structures destroyed in the 150,000-acre fire has reached 14,033 as the fire still burns at 65 percent containment.\n\nParish's twin sister, Alli Benefield, said she's relying on her family.\n\n\"It's a comfort being surrounded by people who have loved me my entire life and have been with me through this entire trial,\" Benefield said.\n\nOutside, people shared hugs, tears and stories.\n\nOn the church's side lawn Vinaya Gokarn was prepared with leaves and flower petals of yellow, white, purple and pink. Gokarn worked with visitors to make a mandala as a way for people affected by the Camp Fire to \"find a healing space,\" she said.\n\nMore: Gov. Brown: Trump has 'got our back' after California wildfires\n\nMore: Despite the risks, I can't imagine being anything but a California firefighter\n\n\"I'm inviting people to add to the mandala so they can get the same feeling of healing that I am,\" Gokarn said.\n\nThe Walnut Creek woman said she asked the church pastor, Jesse Kearns, for permission before making the mandala.\n\nKearns said he was happy to see the buddhist art form helping visitors.\n\n\"This is so organic,\" Kearns said.\n\nGokarn said she goes for a walk each day, collecting items from nature and using them to make a mandala. She said she wanted to share the creation Sunday with residents of Paradise and others affected by the Camp Fire.\n\n\"I wanted to come here and create a sacred space for healing,\" Gokarn said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/19/california-wildfires/2052810002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press, Tia Goldenberg, Associated Press", "title": "Israel avoids early elections as coalition is kept intact", "description": "A key coalition partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government said on Monday that he would not withdraw his party, keeping the coalition intact despite a crisis triggered by a violent flare-up with Gaza militants.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/19/israel-avoids-early-elections-coalition-kept-intact/2052806002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/3726253b-78d1-478c-8de1-841582eb3116-EPA_ISRAEL_GOVERNMENT_POLITICS.JPG?crop=4968,2781,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T10:32:03Z", "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he listens to the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee for the first time as Minister of Defense of Israel in the Israeli Knesset, (Israeli Parliament), in Jerusalem, 19 November 2018.

Bennett threatened to bolt the government if he wasn\u2019t named defense minister, a post Netanyahu said Sunday he was taking over himself.\n\nNetanyahu has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the cease-fire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class, rocket-battered towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his Likud Party.\n\nBut in an impassioned speech Sunday announcing his new role as defense minister, Netanyahu sought to brandish his security credentials in the face of the criticism while pinning blame on his coalition partners for trying to force early elections during a sensitive time for Israel\u2019s security.\n\nHe repeated the claim Monday, saying it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d to dissolve the government and call early elections amid a tense security situation.\n\nNetanyahu would have entered any campaign weakened by the recent Gaza flare-up but heartened by the lack of any real challenger to his leadership.\n\nCLOSE Palestinian militants on Monday fired dozens of rockets and mortar shells into southern Israel, critically wounding an Israeli teen in what appeared to be an act of revenge after a deadly undercover Israeli military raid the day before. (Nov. 12) AP\n\nMost opinion polls, including those after the crisis began, show Netanyahu easily securing re-election, which would grant him a place in Israeli history as the country\u2019s longest serving leader.\n\nAccording to polls, the political map would not change much from the current one, where one of Israel\u2019s most hard-line governments faces a fragmented opposition unable to pose a serious challenge.\n\nBut Netanyahu may find a challenge to his rule from other corners, including a potential corruption indictment that could knock him out of contention.\n\nPolice have recommended he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases and have questioned him at length on another. The country has been eagerly awaiting the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether to press charges.\n\nNetanyahu has angrily dismissed the accusations against him, characterizing them as part of a media-orchestrated witch-hunt that is obsessed with removing him from office.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/19/israel-avoids-early-elections-coalition-kept-intact/2052806002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Senator Kamala Harris campaigns in Mississippi", "description": "Senator Kamala Harris, a California Democrat and possible 2020 presidential contender, campaigned in Mississippi for Democratic US Senate Candidate Mike Espy.

(Photo: Jessica Hill/AP)\n\nVoters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah tend to skew conservative politically, and the last time they supported a Democratic president was in 1964. Yet on Nov. 6, voters in all three states passed Medicaid expansion referendums after their governments failed to act. To succeed, these referendums needed a key voting bloc to look past its self-interest: college graduates with bachelor\u2019s degrees.\n\nThe key to understanding the passage of these initiatives lies in the results of a similar referendum a year ago in Maine, which was the first state in the union to consider Medicaid expansion by popular vote. In research that will appear next year in the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, I and Amalia Miller of the University of Virginia explored who voted in favor of Medicaid expansion in Maine. Because there was no exit polling, we examined local area voting results and Census information. We found that the expansion drew the most support in areas where a significant portion of residents had four-year degrees.\n\nThe association is shown in this figure, where each circle represents a locality in Maine, sized to reflect the number of votes cast. The vote share for Medicaid expansion is plotted against the share of the population with a bachelor\u2019s degree. College education has a strong, positive association with voting in favor of Medicaid.\n\nEach circle represents a locality in Maine, sized to reflect the total number of votes cast plotted against the share of the population with a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Photo: David Matsa/Handout)\n\nMedicaid expansion has been in the hands of each state since a landmark 2012 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act as federal law, but it left the decision to expand Medicaid to individual states. Most legislatures have approved or rejected Medicaid expansion along party lines. A recent example is in Virginia, where election of a Democratic majority in the legislature was soon followed by Medicaid expansion in that state.\n\nBut politicians are elected on the basis of their positions on a range of issues, and so voters elect legislators who don\u2019t necessarily agree with them on everything. By putting Medicaid expansion on the ballot, voters can express their will on this issue in isolation from other debates in partisan politics.\n\nMore: Health care is now a major liability for Republicans. Will they dig the hole deeper?\n\nMedicaid expansion is popular. Democrats should build on it in midterms and beyond.\n\nVote your fears on health care, not caravan 'crisis' hyped by Trump and Republicans\n\nOpinion polls have found correlations between stated opinions about Medicaid expansion and individual characteristics such as race, party affiliation and Medicaid receipt. We found similar patterns in the results of Maine\u2019s referendum, with groups standing to benefit personally from expansion voting in favor, as you would expect: low-income individuals who would gain eligibility for benefits and the employees of hospitals, which profit from expansion because they are required to provide care to patients in emergency situations regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nConsistent with their self-interest, those with high incomes without bachelor\u2019s degrees tended to vote against.\n\nBut why would college-educated voters want to expand a safety net meant for low-income and poverty-level individuals?\n\nPresumably, those with four-year degrees would not likely personally need the Medicaid expansion that allows more low-income people \u2014 specifically nondisabled, nonelderly adults with no children \u2014 to qualify for benefits. Support from these voters speaks largely to selflessness, to support a measure that creates a cost but benefits others.\n\nDoes more education foster more empathy?\n\nOur analysis of voter behavior in Maine found that college graduates with humanities degrees were the most supportive of Medicaid expansion. People with science and engineering degrees also tended to vote in favor.\n\nIn contrast, business majors were more likely to oppose it. Business majors might more often be Republicans, but general party support does not explain these sizable differences. Controlling for political party affiliation, the split between humanities and business majors remains.\n\nThe larger question is whether more education actually fosters more empathy. Is this principle also applicable more broadly? Ballot initiatives on raising the minimum wage could be a fertile area of study; voters have approved a dozen in the past five years, including two this month in Missouri and Arkansas.\n\nSuch research could give us clues about the social impact of direct democracy.\n\nDavid Matsa is a professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Neither did one of the most famous lawyers in American history \u2013 President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nSo what will happen if you die without leaving a will? Probably the last thing you want: Instead of you deciding who gets your small business, the government decides.\n\nEach state has its own set of laws to follow when someone dies intestate (that is, without a will or other estate plan.) As a small-business person, your estate will be divvied up the way politicians in your state believe is best.\n\nMore: Why you gotta be so rude?

Estate planning can be boring, and no one wants to think about death. But it doesn\u2019t have to be difficult. Here\u2019s what to do in three easy steps:\n\n1. Preplan.\n\nFor an entrepreneur, an estate plan needs to be a lot more than simply a will.\n\nWhat you need is an actual plan for what will happen to your family, property and business if you become incapacitated or when you die. The things to consider are:\n\n\u2022 Disability insurance: This is an affordable product that replaces up to 60 percent of your income on a tax-free basis if illness or injury prevents you from earning your income.\n\n\u2022 Life insurance: What would it cost to feed, house, clothe and educate your family if you were to die today? You need enough life insurance to cover that plus help them with other needs, such as a down payment on a home or to start a business.\n\nAnother thing life insurance can do for an entrepreneur is help keep the business alive after you are gone. The proceeds can be earmarked in your estate plan to meet business obligations and thereby spare your loved ones from having to conduct a fire-sale of the business.\n\n\u2022 A succession plan: If you are a sole proprietor, you need to groom a successor. If you have a family-run business, you need to decide how your share can best be divided.\n\nIf you own a corporation or have partners, you will want some sort of buy-sell agreement. This is a contract that dictates how partners can buy each other out. In this case, partners would be buying out your share from the estate.\n\n2. Get your documents prepared.\n\nYes, you can do them yourself, but this is one time when I strongly recommend hiring an attorney. These are the docs you need:\n\n\u2022 A will and/or trust: A will is especially important if you have young children as you will use it to name guardians. The problem with a will alone is that it ensures probate, which is a public, expensive court process that gathers and distributes your assets. A trust, on the other hand, remains private and no court costs are involved.\n\n\u2022 Health care directives: If you are unable to make health care decisions for yourself, your health care directive tells people what sort of care you want.\n\n\u2022 Financial power of attorney: You will want to give someone you trust the power to make financial decisions.\n\n\u2022 Beneficiary designations: On your 401(k), bank accounts, insurance policies, etc., you will want to name beneficiaries. If you don\u2019t, a court will decide this for you.\n\n3. Let people know your wishes.\n\nAll of this work is for naught if your loved ones don\u2019t know you did it or where to find it. Equally important, they will need to know your passwords, email accounts and other online aspects of your business.\n\nThe best system I have seen for organizing all of this is called Future File, created by noted financial expert Carol Roth. Among other things, when needed, the Future File system makes it easy for your loved ones to locate and access your important documents, insurance policies, investment and other accounts, digital assets, etc. They will thank you for this.\n\nNo, estate planning isn\u2019t fun, but it is responsible. And that too is part of the life of a small business person.\n\n\u2014\n\nSteve Strauss, @Steve Strauss on Twitter, is a lawyer specializing in small business and entrepreneurship who has been writing for USATODAY.com for 20 years.

(Photo: Erik S. Lesser/epa-EFE)\n\nThe flap over CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass raises larger questions about the troubling relationship between journalists and the Trump presidency. Fixing the problem will take more than simply ejecting members of the press who can\u2019t behave.\n\nRude reporters are nothing new. Recall the days when Sam Donaldson would shout questions at President Ronald Reagan, and the Gipper would smile and pretend not to hear them. Some back then criticized Donaldson for being bad-mannered, and maybe he was, but at least his questions were substantive.\n\nContrast this with Acosta accusing the president of \u201cdemonizing\u201d migrants with a political ad showing them climbing over a border wall. In the world of actual news, the fact that migrants have climbed fences and barriers along the border many times before isn't controversial at all. But that reality does not fit Acosta\u2019s narrative.\n\nPart of the problem is the overheated way some members of the news media have reacted to the Trump presidency. Transforming the traditional \u201cwatchdog\u201d role into \u201cThe Resistance\u201d helps account for Trump\u2019s 92 percent negative press coverage. Veteran Washington reporter Bob Woodward noted that there has been an \u201cemotional reaction\u201d to the president, and many \u201chave become emotionally unhinged about this.\u201d Woodward \u2014 definitely no fan of Trump \u2014 says the solution lies in better reporting and less \u201csmugness.\u201d\n\nThe White House is a theater for the press\n\nBut another important factor is the willingness of some reporters to put themselves at the center of the story. John P. Roche, who was an adviser in Lyndon Johnson\u2019s White House, ruefully observed that television killed American politics. The same might be said about TV\u2019s impact on substantive political reporting, especially when supercharged by the internet and social media. Televised White House briefings and news conferences have become theaters for self-promoting journalists seeking to disrupt rather than describe. Acosta\u2019s antics are a symptom of a problem enabled by a format that encourages personality-driven reporting.\n\nMore: CNN's Jim Acosta is now the story, as he likes: Today's talker\n\nTwo more years of this? Donald Trump spars with media during press conference\n\nDonald Trump vs. CNN ... again. Now on a world stage and with a hint of totalitarianism.\n\nLive television encourages the hectoring tone of reporters who make provocative statements masked as questions, trying to create news rather than cover it. Turning off the cameras could go a long way to mitigating this. The White House experimented with this approach last year, and in response Acosta suggested that reporters stage a walkout. But ending live televised coverage gained bipartisan support from Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton\u2019s press secretary Mike McCurry, who argued it would result in toned-down briefings and less \u201cgotcha\u201d journalism.\n\nReporters naturally resist any proposed restrictions on their prerogatives, usually invoking the First Amendment to support their claims of privilege. Acosta\u2019s defense team raised the precedent set in the 1977 D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals case Sherrill v. Knight, in which the court stated that when White House press facilities have \u201cbeen made publicly available as a source of information for newsmen, the protection afforded news gathering under the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press requires that this access not be denied arbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons.\u201d\n\nIt's time to update White House press briefings\n\nThe Sherrill case set a standard for equal access, but the White House can still choose how to make access available. For example, it might be time to rethink the custom of the daily news briefing, which is rooted in a 20th century top-down corporate view of the media world, echoing a time when the news was dominated by three TV networks, two wire services and a handful of major newspapers. It seems oddly out of place in the networked information age.\n\nLikewise, it might make sense to set up a press center off the White House grounds, with better facilities, more workspace and the ability to provide direct access to a greater variety of reporting outlets. The current briefing room could be removed and Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s indoor swimming pool \u2014 which still exists beneath it \u2014 could be restored.\n\nThere is also the possibility that reporters could voluntarily ramp back their snarky, narrative-driven approach to news gathering and return to old-school best practices. CBS News White House correspondent Major Garrett was one of the few journalists in the wake of the Acosta imbroglio to uphold the idea of a \u201cstandard of conduct\u201d for reporters on the White House beat.\n\n\u201cI respect the institution and the country\u2019s choice,\u201d Garrett said, noting that he does his \u201clevel best to not make myself part of story, and I think the best journalists operate that way.\u201d\n\nIndeed they do. If only more of them were covering the White House.\n\nJames S.

It was the third time a Football Bowl Subdivision player had run for 300 yards this season.\n\nWith 3,846 career yards, Taylor has broken fellow Badger Ron Dayne's FBS record for combined rushing totals as a freshman and sophomore.

Browning is 37-13 (.740) after the Huskies' win over Oregon State.\n\nTEN AGAIN FOR SOONERS\n\nOklahoma's win over Kansas secured the Sooners' nation-leading 39th season of at least 10 wins.

(AP Photo/Robert Franklin, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Quentin Hillsman is already thinking ahead to March and the NCAA Tournament.\n\nSyracuse's coach scheduled up in the early part of the season with games against No. 3 Oregon and No. 20 Texas A&M with the hopes of playing well and potentially getting a home game in the opening weekend of the NCAAs.\n\n\"I think hosting the NCAA Tournament worked out good for us,\" Hillsman said after the team beat Texas A&M on Wednesday. \"Try to get those games back in the Dome again. We're very much conscious of how we schedule and who we schedule. I remember awhile back sitting in the room for selection the year we were left out. ... I can't blame it on our schedule anymore. I told the (kids) I schedule this way on purpose because I thought we were good enough. The teams that we scheduled and tournaments we're going to, they are very good teams. We're not playing any bad teams in those neutral site games. It's about trying to host these games and be at home (for the NCAAs).\"\n\nSyracuse hosted the opening two rounds of the NCAAs in 2016 and advanced to the title game that year.\n\nHere are other things that happened in women's college basketball this past week:\n\nREACHING A MILESTONE: C. Vivian Stringer became the fifth Division I coach and sixth overall to reach the 1,000-win mark on Tuesday night when Rutgers beat Central Connecticut State. Stringer joined Pat Summitt, Geno Auriemma, Tara VanDerveer and Sylvia Hatchell in the club. Division II coach Barbara Stevens, of Bentley College, also has reached 1,000 victories, as well as Duke men's coach Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nBIG 12 DOMINANCE: The Big 12 was the last conference to lose a game this season after starting the year 26-0. The Big 12 is 30-2 through the first 13 days of the season and the league has two wins over Top 25 teams, with Baylor beating then-No. 23 Arizona State and Iowa State's victory over No. 24 Miami. The Cyclones claimed the Preseason WNIT with that victory \u2014 the fifth time a Big 12 program won the WNIT since 2002 and the first since Baylor did it in 2015.\n\nFIRST OF MANY: Tina Thompson won the first game as head coach when Virginia beat Old Dominion 72-67 on Sunday. The Cavaliers dropped their opening two games, losing to No. 6 Mississippi State and Kentucky.\n\nTRIPLE DOUBLE: Rider guard Stella Johnson recorded the first triple-double in women's basketball history at the school when the team beat Mount St. Mary's 85-67 on Saturday. Johnson had a career-high 35 points on an efficient 14-of-19 shooting from the field to go along with 12 rebounds, 10 assists and six steals. Johnson is now 11 behind NCAA career leader Sabrina Ionescu, who got her 12th one on Sunday. She did it while only hitting one field goal for No. 3 Oregon in a win over Buffalo. The junior guard had 10 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds, getting it with a rebound with 1:24 left.\n\nSAD NEWS: South Florida senior guard Kitija Laksa suffered a torn ACL and meniscus in her right knee on Thursday night when the No. 21 Bulls beat Bethune-Cookman 88-39.\n\nThe 6-foot Laksa, who played for her home country Latvia in the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup earlier this year, led South Florida in scoring the past two seasons. She averaged 19.2 points as a sophomore and 21.1 points last year. Laksa, who was averaging 16.3 points this season, set an NCAA record with 11 consecutive 3s in a game last year.\n\nFIRE WOES: Ohio State's trip to play Stanford and Sacramento State was cancelled because of the poor air quality in Northern California. The Buckeyes were going to play Sacramento State on Friday and Stanford on Sunday. The teams will work on rescheduling the games for next year.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Joey Logano was the underdog in NASCAR's title race, the driver few thought capable of keeping pace with the Big Three and stealing the title from one of the favorites.\n\nLogano proved everyone wrong with an upset victory in a season in which he only became a true contender once his Team Penske group started the postseason. He blazed his way through the playoffs and closed out his improbable run Sunday with a win at Homestead-Miami Speedway that seized his first NASCAR title.\n\n\"It's been so hard and such a long road to get here and been so close and had that feeling of defeat, and man, it stings,\" Logano said. \"But I felt so confident going into this week that we were the car to beat. My race team, I wasn't worried about them at all, and I knew I just had to do my job and everyone was going to do their job and everything was going to be fine.\"\n\nLogano soundly defeated Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr., in a finale Logano had dubbed \"the Big Three and me.\"\n\nHe won the title with two victories and eight top-10 finishes in the postseason. At Homestead, where it was winner-take-all, Logano led a race-high 80 laps but needed a late caution for one final shot to win the race. It came when teammate Brad Keselowski spun Busch teammate Daniel Suarez for a race-changing caution.\n\nLogano was fourth on the restart with 15 laps remaining but powered his way alongside leader Truex, used a strong move in the outside lane three laps later to take over the top spot. Logano pulled away from there and won for Penske.\n\n\"We were the favorite. We executed down the stretch like nobody's business,\" Logano said. \"I knew we had a short-run car. I said it before the race started that if it was anything longer than 25 laps we were going to be in trouble. That showed all day. But it came down to the short run and we are champions. NASCAR champions.\"\n\nLogano won the title in his 10th season at NASCAR's top level and is the first driver from Connecticut to win a championship.\n\nLogano capped a banner year for Roger Penske, who also was elected into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, won the Indianapolis 500 for a record 17th time and celebrated Team Penske's 500th victory.\n\nTeam Penske also has been the cornerstone for Ford the last six seasons, and Logano gave the manufacturer its first Cup title since 2004.\n\nThe Big Three won 20 of 36 races in 2017. Harvick (23), Busch (22) and Truex (20) also are the first trio of drivers to have 20-plus top-fives in a season since Cale Yarborough, Richard Petty and Benny Parsons in 1997.\n\nHere are some other items of note from Sunday's championship race:\n\nEVERYTHING MUST GO\n\nTruex said goodbye to his championship hopes and farewell to Furniture Row Racing.\n\nTruex fell just shy of winning his second straight NASCAR championship in the final race for Colorado-based FRR. Furniture Row shuttered its doors after a 14-year run in which it morphed from an underfunded backmarker to NASCAR champion with Truex behind the wheel.\n\nTruex was in prime position to repeat until a late caution ruined the night and left him wondering what might have been.\n\n\"No question we had the car to beat,\" Truex said. \"But if you don't lead the last lap, it doesn't matter what you got. We fought hard. We played the right strategy. We were off a little in the daytime, just like last year. We kept getting it better and better and better. On the long run, man, the thing was nasty. We killed them. That was cool, but it didn't come down to that tonight.\"\n\nOnce 5-hour Energy pulled out of NASCAR and no other sponsorship could be secured, owner Barney Visser pulled the plug on the organization.\n\nTruex wanted to deliver the ultimate parting gift for FRR.\n\n\"It sucks,\" he said. \"It hurts. It's terrible. I hate it. I wish we could go on and race 10 more years together, but we can't.\"\n\nONE FOR THE ROAD\n\nJimmie Johnson hugged it out with crew chief Chad Knaus and toasted with beers to the end of their 17-year professional relationship. Johnson and Knaus are parting ways after seven NASCAR championships.\n\nThey couldn't grasp greatness one final time, finishing 14th in the finale and going winless in a season for the first time in his Cup career.\n\n\"He is my brother, there is just no way around it,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson hasn't won since Dover in 2017, an unthinkable string of 59 straight losses.\n\n\"I've had such a fortunate career and I would have loved to keep that streak alive,\" Johnson said.\n\nIT'S THE PITS\n\nBusch and Harvick combined to win 16 races, lead nearly 3,500 laps and each were considered a heavy favorite to win a second NASCAR championship. They got a big 0 in the win column when they needed it most.\n\nHarvick, dominant in the No. 4 Ford all year, lagged on the speed charts all weekend. The Joe Gibbs Racing' pit crew flubbed two stops for Busch \u2014 the blunders cost him six and four spots off pit road \u2014 that denied one of NASCAR's biggest career winners a second title.\n\n\"You can always have stops where things don't go your way,\" Gibbs said. \"That's part of life.\"\n\nFORD FOCUSED\n\nFord slammed the door on NASCAR's longest championship drought.\n\nLogano gave the American automaker its eighth drivers' title and first since Kurt Busch in 2004. Ford also won the manufacturers' title for the first time since 2002. It marked the first time since 1999 the blue oval won both championships in the same season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThere has been some early tinkering to lineups, a few hiccups and lots of drama to start the NBA season.\n\nNone of the league's final four teams from last season \u2014 Boston, Cleveland, Houston, Golden State \u2014 look like locks to hoist the Larry O'Brien Trophy this time.\n\nThe addition of Carmelo Anthony to the Rockets' roster produced more thorns than fruit, and now he is out.\n\nIn Boston, the Celtics are having early trouble trying to figure out how best to use their overflowing mix of young and veteran talent following the return of Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward from injuries.\n\nAnd Cleveland has gotten off to a predictable slow start to the post-LeBron James' era, but few expected the total collapse by the Cavaliers.\n\nHowever, there is no drama like championship drama and the defending champion Warriors suddenly look more like the cast of a reality series than a harmonious lineup rolling along and vying for a third straight championship.\n\nDraymond's Green public outburst at Kevin Durant during the Warriors' overtime loss to the Clippers on Nov. 12 lingers. Now there is tension on a team that has managed to remain mostly drama-free during its run. Durant's impending free agency, Green's lack of an apology, and Steph Curry's injury has opened a window for teams.\n\nSome of the NBA's most recent mini-dynasties have dissipated because of infighting.\n\nSquabbling between Michael Jordan and Chicago Bulls management at least contributed to their decline after Jordan's second three-peat and subsequent second retirement in 1999. Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal couldn't coexist long enough to extend the Los Angeles Lakers' run of three straight titles from 2000 to 2002.\n\nGreen has vowed the Warriors will still be there in the end.\n\nThat remains to be seen.\n\n3s COMPANY\n\nLittle guys doing work outside and big men camped out close to the basket is an old-school approach to basketball that's starting to look as old as James Naismith's original peach baskets.\n\nThe NBA needs to send out thank-you cards to the ABA.\n\nEveryone digs the long ball.\n\nNext year will mark the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the 3-point shot in the league. Over those four decades it's gone from being one of the handful of innovations carried over from the ABA to a necessity for any player \u2014 from guards to 7-footers \u2014 wanting to have longevity in the league.\n\nDuring the 2012-13 season, 33 NBA players listed at 6-foot-8 or taller averaged at least one 3-point attempt. That number grew to 124 last season.\n\nThe 2018-19 season is barely two months old, but two teams (Boston and Golden State) have already logged 24 made 3-pointers in a game. The record of 25 was set late last season by Cleveland.\n\nAnd in case anyone needed a reminder of the shot's increased popularity, look no further than Milwaukee's Brook Lopez. He became the third 7-footer in NBA history to hit eight 3-pointers in a game when he did it against Denver last week.\n\n\"You see the way the game's trending, it's definitely moving in that direction,\" Lopez said. \"I'm just trying to be professional, do my job, try to get my work in. I want to be as good as I can in every possible area of the game.\"\n\nLopez said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer has been supportive of him stepping out beyond the arc.\n\n\"Regardless if I miss, if I have off-games where I don't shoot as well, they just tell me\" to keep shooting, Lopez said.\n\nOther veteran big men around the league are hearing similar refrains.\n\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\n\n\u2014 San Antonio at New Orleans, Monday: DeMar DeRozan had 26 points and LaMarcus Aldridge added 22 points and 12 rebounds during the Spurs' win in San Antonio earlier this month. The Pelicans look to return the favor after recovering nicely from a six-game losing skid.\n\n\u2014 Los Angeles Lakers at Cleveland, Wednesday: In a pre-Turkey Day appetizer, LeBron James returns to face Cleveland for the first time this season following his free agency departure to L.A.\n\n\u2014 New Orleans at Philadelphia, Wednesday: The Pelicans get their first crack at the new-look 76ers following their acquisition of Jimmy Butler.\n\n\u2014 Portland at Golden State, Friday: The Warriors get a look at one of their chief challengers in the West when they meet the Blazers for the first time this season.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Genaro Armas in Milwaukee contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: www.apnews.com/NBA and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The argument about where he ranks, whether or not he's the best player to ever step on a basketball court, will continue forever and there will never be a definitive answer.\n\nThat is, unless he keeps doing things like this.\n\nIn his 16th season, James can still make the game look absurdly easy.

He's only the second player to score at least 50 in a game this deep into an NBA career; the other is Kobe Bryant, in his final game, and that was aided by 50 shot attempts.\n\n\"I've always been a guy to let the game talk for itself, speak for itself,\" James said. \"My body of work speaks for itself, still to this day, 16 years in.\"\n\nHe paused for a second, breaking into a big smile.\n\n\"If there's ever a discussion,\" James said, \"games like this will make sure you figure it out.\"\n\nBryant had gone more than seven years without a 50-point game before April 13, 2016, when he went 22-for-50 and scored 60 points at Staples Center as the Laker faithful roared for his work one final time. James hadn't gone six months since his last 50-point night; it was Game 1 of last season's NBA Finals, the one where J.R. Smith forgot the score in the final seconds and Cleveland lost to Golden State on the way to a sweep.\n\nJames was methodical on Sunday; he was 19 for 31 from the field, 6 for 8 from 3-point range, getting to 51 points on a deep 3-pointer in the final seconds with the outcome already long decided.\n\n\"That's all coaching,\" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. \"Just great coaching. ... No, the way he sees the game, he knows what he's doing out there.\"\n\nThrough 16 games, though there's nothing to suggest that he's going to slow down this season \u2014 or anytime soon \u2014 James is his usual sensational self. He's averaging 28.8 points on 52 percent shooting, with 7.7 rebounds and 6.9 assists per game.\n\nNo one in NBA history has ever averaged that many points in a 16th season or later. Bryant is the only player to average more than 25 points this deep into a career; he averaged 27.9 points in 2011-12, 27.3 points in 2012-13.\n\nBut it's not just the scoring. Only Steve Nash, John Stockton and Jason Kidd \u2014 three of the best point guards ever \u2014 averaged this many assists at this point in their career.\n\n\"He's the best player in the world,\" Lakers guard Lonzo Ball said.\n\nAdded fellow Laker Kyle Kuzma: \"He could average 40 if he wanted.\"\n\nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra, who had James for four seasons in Miami, describes James' game in one word: \"Timeless.\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter what year, doesn't matter how old,\" Spoelstra said. \"Consistency is as much of a talent as any physical or mental talent. He's five-star in all of those.\"\n\nJames hasn't won an MVP award in any of the past five seasons. For as good as he's been, for as long as he's been that good, it's hard to believe that his first 15 seasons only resulted in him winning that award four times. He should be in the conversation again this year, and thought he should have won the award last year.\n\n\"I just go out and my love for the game keeps me going,\" James said. \"My ability to put in the work, and see what happens after that. I know if I put in the work and be true to the game, then everything else will take care of itself.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Hilton during the first half of an NFL football game against the Tennessee Titans, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLANDOVER, Md. (AP) \u2014 As much as the NFL would rather if everyone discussed all of the yards and TDs produced in game after game, and for whatever advancements have been made in player safety over time, pro football is, at its core, a brutal sport \u2014 and what happened to Alex Smith's right leg is not very different from what happened to Joe Theismann's right leg, exactly 33 years apart.\n\nTheismann knew it right away.\n\nThe former Washington Redskins QB \u2014 whose career ended after he was hurt on a sack by Lawrence Taylor on Nov. 18, 1985 \u2014 was at FedEx Field on Sunday and turned away so he wouldn't have to see the unnatural way in which current Redskins QB Smith's tibia and fibula twisted as they were fractured under the weight of Texans defenders J.J. Watt and Kareem Jackson.\n\n\"It was horrible,\" Theismann said in a telephone interview. \"My heart went out to him. I feel so bad for him.\"\n\nWashington center Chase Rouiller had an even more up-close-and-personal view when Smith was sacked and offered a little insight into what life as an NFL player is like.\n\nThey all know, naturally, that at any moment, it could be them down on the turf, covering their face with their hands before being driven away on a cart.\n\n\"You say your prayers while it's happening,\" Rouiller said, \"and you've got to get ready for the next play.\"\n\nSaid Redskins coach Jay Gruden: \"These things happen in pro football, unfortunately. Just hate to see them happen with a guy like Alex.\"\n\nSmith was not, of course, the only player hurt in this game, which ended with AFC South-leading Houston holding on for a 23-21 victory, their seventh win in a row after an 0-3 start.\n\nNor, unsurprisingly, was he the only starting quarterback hurt during a sack on this day: Marcus Mariota left the Tennessee Titans' 38-10 loss to the Indianapolis Colts with an injured right elbow.\n\nThe league likes to tout all of the offensive records broken in this offense-rules age. The broken bones? Less so.\n\n\"We know we play a violent sport,\" said Colt McCoy, who replaced Smith and will make his first start since 2014 when Washington plays at the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day. \"You just never want to see that happen.\"\n\nIn case you missed it, here are other top topics after the NFL season's 11th Sunday:\n\nFLOP EAGLES FLOP\n\nCarson Wentz threw three picks and zero TDs as the Philadelphia Eagles' offense struggled yet again. The injuries kept mounting as their defense did nothing to slow Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints. If Philadelphia's 48-7 loss at New Orleans didn't mark the end of the meaningful portion of the Eagles' season, it sure looked like it did. It was the most lopsided defeat ever for a reigning Super Bowl champion. The Eagles are 4-6, the Saints are 9-1, and the proceedings felt as if they were a passing of the torch in the NFC. \"Definitely a frustrating one,\" Wentz said. \"We just didn't show up, really.\"\n\nACTION JACKSON\n\nRavens QB Lamar Jackson took one last snap, kneeled to run out the clock on Baltimore's 24-21 victory over Cincinnati in his first professional start, then casually flipped the football to the referee. Jackson started heading to the locker room, pumped his fist \u2014 and then realized he wanted that ball to commemorate the day, so sprinted to run down the official and grabbed his memento. Jackson ran everywhere he wanted to on this afternoon, gaining 117 yards on 27 carries.\n\nAS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT\n\nFor so long, either a leaky offensive line or some sort of injury that might be traced to that o-line limited the effectiveness of Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck. Well, just look at the guy \u2014 and the guys who are paid to protect him \u2014 now. Luck has not been sacked even once in the Colts' past five games, four of them wins, including Sunday against the Titans. Suddenly, the Colts are 5-5 and a contender for an AFC wild-card berth. Probably not a coincidence: Indy has been using high draft picks on linemen lately, including taking guard Quenton Nelson with the No. 6 overall selection this year.\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Kelvin Kuo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBad penalties, bad decisions, bad coaching.\n\nAnd bad losses.\n\nThey occurred all over the NFL on Sunday. The Jaguars , Cardinals, Chargers and Falcons all will be shaking their heads the way their fans are about how they blew games.\n\nAt least the Panthers went down gambling to win, missing a 2-point conversion \u2014 the pass play would have worked but Cam Newton missed a wide-open receiver in the end zone. The others either made suspect choices or played not to lose.\n\nAnd, naturally, they lost.\n\n\"This is as tough as it gets,\" Jaguars defensive end Calais Campbell said after his bunch blew a 16-0 lead to Pittsburgh and lost on a last-second touchdown by Ben Roethliberger. \"There are going to be some games you definitely lose and you'll definitely win. But when it comes down to that last play, and you're on the losing side of it, those hurt, especially in a situation where we're a desperate team in need of a win.\"\n\nAnd a team that got too many field goals, yet got comfortable with that 16-point edge. Jacksonville stopped being as aggressive as it had been earlier in dominating the Steelers, and pretty much dropped from postseason contention at 3-7.\n\n\"If people are in here and they're content \u2014 not saying anybody is \u2014 but if people are content with losing and things not going right,\" star cornerback Jalen Ramsey said, \"then that's not the type of guys you want on the team and that's not the type of environment you want to have.\"\n\nThe environment might be worse in Arizona, where first-year coach Steve Wilks saw his club make several critical errors down the stretch. That led to a 23-21 loss to Oakland, of all teams \u2014 the Raiders were the only team with just one victory heading into the weekend \u2014 that never should have been a defeat.\n\nA dropped pass by running back David Johnson hurt. An unnecessary roughness penalty against Cardinals tight end Jermaine Gresham cost 15 yards and stopped the game clock. On the next play, Johnson ran 57 yards for what was sure to be the clinching score, only to have the play called back on a holding call against tight end Ricky Seals-Jones.\n\nTwo plays later, the Cardinals punted. The Raiders drove 63 yards against a modified prevent defense and won as the clock expired on Daniel Carlson's 35-yard field goal.\n\n\"It was just a dumb play by me,\" Gresham, a nine-year veteran, said after the game. \"I turned around and saw my guy on the ground. We're not coached to that. We're not taught that. They didn't bring me in here to do that, and it was stupid. I cost us the game.\"\n\nNot entirely, but he helped.\n\nThe Chargers had plenty of culprits, too. Their six-game winning string ended when a conservative defense couldn't prevent Denver from going 86 yards in 1:51 for Brandon McManus' winning 34-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nLos Angeles made mistakes throughout, hardly looking like a wild-card front-runner. Philip Rivers threw two interceptions and on a third-down play on LA's final drive, he seemed to panic and threw the ball at a receiver's feet. That led to a punt, but also gave Denver more time for its final drive than it should have gotten.\n\nThe Chargers committed 14 penalties, including 10 in the first half. Mike Badgley, who made three field goals, also missed an extra point. Denver won 23-22.\n\n\"The crucial mistakes that we've been able to stay away from, we didn't today,\" Rivers said.\n\nChampionship candidates avoid those, especially against a weaker opponent.\n\nAtlanta has had plenty of reasons to struggle, particularly a slew of early-season injuries that have worn on a good roster. But the Falcons had won three straight before a poor performance in Cleveland, and they exacerbated their issues with a difficult-to-watch showing late in a 22-19 loss to Dallas on Sunday.\n\nFour of the team's six losses have come either on the opponent's final possession or with the Falcons denied on their final opportunity. Simply put, the Falcons have folded under pressure.\n\n\"It's aggravating at the end of the day,\" said cornerback Robert Alford. \"... We did do some good things today. We can't just hold our heads down. But at the end of the day we've got to learn to finish games.\"\n\nThis time, the Cowboys had little difficulty moving 51 yards to Brett Maher's winning 42-yard kick.\n\nIf your team is going to lose late, at least do it the way Carolina did \u2014 going for it, not backing off or making egregious errors.\n\n\"When you make some errors we made today in critical moments, you open yourselves up to get beat, and that's what happened today,\" Rivers said. \"We had every opportunity to close it out, and we just didn't get it done.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe World Cup of Golf appears to have found a home in southeast Melbourne.\n\nFor the third consecutive time, one of golf's biggest team events is being played at a famous sandbelt course in the southeastern Australian city. The 28-team tournament, based on the Official World Golf Ranking, begins Thursday at Metropolitan Golf Club, with Denmark returning as the defending champion from nearby Kingston Heath in 2016.\n\nIn 2013 at Royal Melbourne, the World Cup was primarily an individual event with a team component, with the individual section similar to what would be used at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Jason Day won the individual title at Royal Melbourne and combined with Adam Scott to win the team title for Australia.\n\nAt Kingston Heath two years ago, the format returned to its more traditional one of fourball (best ball) on the first and third days and foursomes (alternate shot) for the second and final rounds in the 72-hole stroke-play event. So, it'll be fourball to open the tournament at Metropolitan.\n\n\"The sandbelt courses in Australia are (among) the best in the world and some of my favorite to play,\" Tiger Woods says of the layouts which also include Huntingdale, Yarra Yarra and Victoria. \"I have great memories playing there and I look forward to returning.\"\n\nThat will be soon. Royal Melbourne will host its third Presidents Cup in 2019, when Woods will be captain of the U.S. team and Ernie Els in charge of the Internationals. Els is holding a news conference during the World Cup to announce some of his staff, while Woods is planning a December scouting mission at Royal Melbourne.\n\nSoren Kjeldsen and Thorjorn Olesen, who won the title for Denmark by four strokes, return to Metropolitan. With Jason Day staying in the United States because of the pending birth of a child and Scott unavailable, Australia will be represented by Marc Leishman and Cameron Smith.\n\nMatt Kuchar, who won the 2011 World Cup for the U.S. with partner Gary Woodland, is teaming up with Kyle Stanley. Ian Poulter and Tyrrell Hatton will represent England and will start among the favorites. Anirban Lahiri, who missed the cut at last week's Australian Open, will partner Gaganjeet Bhullar for India.\n\nOne player coming in on a high will be Abraham Ancer, who won the Australian Open at The Lakes in Sydney by five strokes. He'll have Roberto Diaz playing with him and representing Mexico.\n\n\"My first time in Australia, everybody told me how great it was,\" Ancer said, \"and I feel like I love this country already in four or five days that I've been here.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Or at all.\n\n\"We found a way to make winning plays. Sometimes when you have a night like that where you're not flowing offensively you have to be able to do that. Our guys did that,\" Minnesota coach Richard Pitino said.\n\nJordan Murphy scored 14 points, Amir Coffey added 12 points, and Minnesota hit 10 of 14 free throws in the closing minutes to hold off Texas A&M 69-64 on Sunday night in the Vancouver Shootout.\n\nThe Golden Gophers (3-0) watched a 14-point first-half lead disappear, but made enough free-throw attempts late to get the victory despite going the final four minutes without a basket. Texas A&M led 64-63, but had four straight empty possessions, missing a pair of long 3-pointers late in the shot clock and committing a pair of turnovers.\n\nThe Gophers capitalized on the mistakes at the free-throw line, making six attempts in the final two minutes to hold off the Aggies. Dupree McBrayer added 10 points for the Gophers.\n\n\"We were pretty poised down the stretch. I think the older guys definitely took the wheel a little bit,\" Murphy said.\n\nBrandon Mahan scored a career-high 17 points on 6-of-8 shooting and helped ignite Texas A&M's rally, but the Aggies (1-3) lost their third straight and faltered in the closing minutes. Mahan had 14 total points on the season through three games.\n\nChristian Mekowulu added 16 points and TJ Starks had 11 for the Aggies. It was a far better showing for the Aggies than their last game against Gonzaga when they were blown out.\n\n\"We thought we had good momentum going down the stretch but we struggled scoring the last three, four minutes,\" Texas A&M coach Billy Kennedy said. \"We didn't get good shots or run good offense and you have to give Minnesota credit. I thought they showed a little more poise down the stretch than we did.\"\n\nMinnesota led by as many as 14 in the first half, only to let Texas A&M slowly chip away. The Aggies pulled within 41-36 early in the second half on Mahan's corner 3-pointer, but Minnesota built the lead back to 11 after Murphy's first basket of the second half for a 51-40 lead with 11 minutes left.\n\nThat's when the Aggies got hot, running off 12 of the next 16 points and closing within 55-52 on Isiah Jasey's dunk. Matz Stockman scored for Minnesota on a rebound putback, but the Aggies scored six straight capped by Mahan's dunk to pull even at 57-all with 5:50 left. Mahan followed with his second 3-pointer and Texas A&M had its first lead since the opening minute of the game.\n\nDaniel Oturu's rebound basket with 4:09 left ended Minnesota's three-minute scoring drought and was the final field goal for the Gophers. Murphy, Coffey and McBrayer all took turns hitting free throws to seal it while Texas A&M struggled to get good looks.\n\n\"I thought our zone bothered them, slowed them down a little bit. We found a way to get stops,\" Pitino said.\n\nTURNOVER TROUBLES\n\nMinnesota committed 20 turnovers \u2014 16 in the first half \u2014 as it struggled for stretches dealing with how physical Texas A&M played defense.\n\n\"They're physical and we hadn't seen a defense like that yet,\" Pitino said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMinnesota: The Gophers are now 20-15 against SEC opponents and picked up a second straight nonconference Power Five win after beating Utah.\n\nTexas A&M: The Aggies will be frustrated by their start against Minnesota, but the rebound in keeping the game close into the second half was a far better showing than their last game against No. 3 Gonzaga. The Aggies trailed Gonzaga by 10 at halftime, but gave up 51 second-half points and trailed by as many as 34. ... The Aggies will appreciate the day of rest before facing Washington.

I\u2019m not playing up to my standards.\u201d\n\nThings didn't improve much for Philadelphia in the remaining three quarters. The Saints continued to roll, as quarterback Drew Brees connected with six different players for passes of at least 16 yards. The run game jelled, with Mark Ingram compiling 103 yards and two scores on the ground while Alvin Kamara rushed for 72 yards and added 92 as a receiver. When the Eagles secondary \u2013 what was left of it, as two more defensive backs suffered game-ending injuries \u2013 looked to shut down star receiver Michael Thomas, Brees built chemistry with rookie Tre\u2019Quan Smith. Smith followed up a nine-game stint of 12 catches and 214 yards with 10 catches, 157 yards and a touchdown in his 10th game since New Orleans drafted him in the third round of Central Florida.\n\nThe Eagles couldn\u2019t answer.\n\nThis was different than their first four losses, in which they fell by 6, 3, 2, 4 and 7 points, respectively.\n\nMore: Malcolm Jenkins explains why he gave Sean Payton the finger after long TD on fourth down\n\nThe message needs to change, defensive end Chris Long said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not immune to losing,\u201d Long told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve been good doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to be every week, roll the ball out there and win.

Wentz\u2019s interceptions, the five sacks the line allowed and a rushing attack that mustered 58 yards all did little to aid a defense that let up 183.1 yards more than the 372.9 it\u2019d been averaging, 12th stingiest in the league.\n\n\u201cIt got ugly,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe silver lining: Even at 4-6, the Eagles are two games away from the NFC East-leading Redskins.

Huh) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Dalvin Cook and Latavius Murray had nowhere to go, all night long.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings got pushed around by the Chicago Bears in prime time.\n\nMinnesota managed just 22 yards on the ground while Jordan Howard powered an effective rushing attack for Chicago, sending the Vikings to a costly 25-20 loss on Sunday. The disparity on the ground led to a noticeable difference in time of possession, and Minnesota's defense looked tired at times, especially in the first half.\n\n\"The game just went a different way,\" Cook said. \"We just didn't get it going. We ran the ball about 15 times. ... You can't find a rhythm. That's just how it was today. We just couldn't find a rhythm on offense.\"\n\nThe Vikings (5-4-1) went 13-3 last season and made it to the NFC Championship game before losing to Philadelphia. But they are going to need some help to take the NFC North again after Chicago (7-3) earned its fourth straight victory in the first meeting between the longtime rivals.\n\nCook finished with 12 yards on nine carries, and Murray contributed 5 yards on four rushing attempts. It was the continuation of a season-long problem for the Vikings, who began the weekend ranked 28th in the NFL with an average of 91.7 yards rushing per game.\n\nIt seemed as if Cook and Murray had to make a cut in the backfield every time they touched the ball. Left tackle Riley Reiff was beaten repeatedly by Khalil Mack, and center Pat Elflein struggled against Akiem Hicks in the middle.\n\n\"I think it's easy to throw blame on one group when there was a lot of things that happened in the course of that ballgame,\" coach Mike Zimmer said. \"Our offensive line is fighting their rear ends off, so I'm not going to place blame on them.\"\n\nThe problems began on Minnesota's first possession. Murray was tackled by Hicks for a 1-yard loss on third-and-1, forcing the Vikings to punt.\n\nMinnesota drove inside the Chicago 20 on its next possession, but Mack forced Cook to fumble and recovered the ball.\n\n\"He made a play,\" Cook said. \"That's what he's been doing since he got there. He made a play at the line of scrimmage. He just stuck his hand out there.\"\n\nWhile Minnesota's lack of a rushing attack was nothing new, the Vikings had been able to stop their opponent from running the ball. But Chicago gained 148 yards on the ground for its highest total since it rushed for 179 in a victory over the New York Jets on Oct. 28, and the most allowed by Minnesota this season.\n\nHoward finished with 63 yards on 18 carries, and Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky helped neutralize the Vikings' pass rush with 43 yards on the ground. Tarik Cohen almost equaled Minnesota's total for the game when he gained 21 on one third-quarter rushing attempt.\n\n\"In the first half we didn't play great defensively,\" Zimmer said. \"We played a lot better in the second half. Most of it was missed tackles in the first half I thought.\n\n\"We made enough mistakes tonight that didn't allow us to win.\"\n\nThe absence of a rushing game put more pressure on Kirk Cousins, and he threw two costly interceptions. Eddie Jackson picked him off in the fourth quarter and returned it 36 yards for a key touchdown.\n\n\"We didn't establish the run game,\" tight end Kyle Rudolph said. \"When you play a defense as good as theirs and you don't run the football and you become one-dimensional, it's hard to have success.\"\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Bears won 25-20. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 No doubt about it now, the Bears really are serious about winning the NFC North.\n\nKhalil Mack had a sack and fumble recovery, Eddie Jackson returned an interception for a touchdown and Chicago tightened its grip on the division with a 25-20 victory over the second-place Minnesota Vikings on Sunday night.\n\nMack and Jackson led a dominant effort by the defense. And Chicago (7-3) took a big step toward its first division championship since 2010.\n\nThe Bears won their fourth in a row, their longest streak since a six-game run in 2012. Chicago finished 10-6 that year, missed the playoffs and fired coach Lovie Smith after that season.\n\n\"You've got to understand the situation, facing a division opponent, knowing we're going to face them twice a year,\" Mack said. \"We've got to make that jump and you (saw) it today. It's knowing what's at stake. Everybody showed up ready to play.\"\n\nThe Monsters of the Midway simply dominated Minnesota on Sunday, taking out the defending division champions after beating three struggling teams \u2014 the New York Jets, Buffalo Bills and Detroit Lions.\n\nThe Bears also have victories the past two weeks over NFC North opponents after dropping 10 in a row against division foes.\n\n\"This isn't about proving, I don't think for us, as much as it is about our guys just learning that they can trust one-another,\" coach Matt Nagy said. \"When you stick together through the highs and the lows and you work as hard as our guys do together and you listen to the coaches and the coaches listen to the players \u2014 there's a collaboration \u2014 you then get a chance to be in a situation like this tonight, to play in front of the whole world.\"\n\nChicago suffocated the Vikings (5-4-1), with big advantages in total yards (308-268) and time of possession (34:29-25:31) even though quarterback Mitchell Trubisky had his difficulties.\n\n\"They're a good defense, but a lot of times we hurt ourselves,\" Vikings receiver Adam Thielen said.\n\nThe Bears were leading by eight midway through the fourth quarter when Jackson picked off a pass from Kirk Cousins that was intended for Laquon Treadwell. His 27-yard TD return and a 2-point conversion pass from Trubisky to Adam Shaheen made it 22-6.\n\nCousins then threw a 13-yard TD to Aldrick Robsinon and a 2-point conversion to Adam Thielen, making it 22-14. But Cody Parkey kicked to 48-yard field goal with 2:48 left. And the Bears hung on from there.\n\nTrubisky was 20 of 31 for 165 yards and a touchdown. But he was intercepted two times by Anthony Harris.\n\nParkey shook off a performance unlike any other by making all three of his field goal attempts. It was a big improvement over the previous week, when he hit uprights four times while missing two field goals and two extra points against Detroit.\n\n\"We all believed in him in the locker room,\" Trubisky said. \"There was never a doubt. ... I'm happy for Cody. He was big-time tonight. He delivered for his team and put some points on the board when we needed them. They were crucial and he did a heck of a job.\"\n\nCousins was consistently under pressure and finished 30 of 46 for 262 yards. He threw two touchdowns in the final 4:51 and got intercepted two times.\n\n\"It was a balance at times,\" Cousins said. \"They weren't necessarily getting a sack, but they were affecting my arm. And at other times the protection was holding up fine and (we) were getting the ball out. I think it was kind of everything across the board. Sometimes, it was a rusher on the edge, sometimes it was a rush inside, it was a game, a stunt, different things.\n\nStefon Diggs had 13 catches for 126 yards and a TD. But the Vikings came up short after winning four of five.\n\nEARLY LEAD\n\nParkey nailed a 33-yard field goal down the middle on Chicago's first possession, drawing a loud and maybe sarcastic roar from the crowd. It was a promising start for a kicker lampooned by Jimmy Fallon on \"The Tonight Show.\" Chicago TV stations even sent helicopters to shoot footage when he practiced at Soldier Field on Wednesday night.\n\nMack gave the crowd more to cheer near the end of the first quarter when he jarred the ball from Dalvin Cook and recovered at the Chicago 15, stopping a scoring threat.\n\nThe Bears added to their lead midway through the second when a sliding Anthony Miller hauled in an 18-yard touchdown from Trubisky. That capped the league's longest touchdown drive this season in terms of plays (13) and time (7:13).Trubisky then hit Josh Bellamy in the end zone to make it 11-0, after Chicago opted to go for two rather than have Parky attempt an extra point.\n\nParkey nailed a 41-yarder with room to spare in the closing minute of the half to make it a 14-point game. The Vikings then drove to the Chicago 32. But with Leonard Floyd bearing down on him, Cousins unleashed a wobbly heave that Adrian Amos picked off with on one else near him.\n\nREMATCH\n\nThe Bears and Vikings face off again on Dec. 30 at Minnesota.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBears: LB Aaron Lynch and TE Adam Shaheen both left the game with concussions.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVikings: Host Green Bay on Nov. 25.\n\nBears: Visit Detroit on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: David Banks, AP)\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 The Chicago Bears truly are the kings of the NFC North.\n\nAs we all expected.\n\nThe Bears tightened their grip on the division lead with a 25-20 throttling of the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday night. Yes, the teams play again in Minnesota in the regular-season finale, but this was a statement game for the Bears, who almost nobody expected to contend for a division title this season.\n\nNext season, sure. But this season?\n\nEven after picking up Khalil Mack in the heist of the season, the Bears were projected by most to finish around .500. This was only Mitchell Trubisky\u2019s second season, and his first with new coach and offensive guru Matt Nagy. Allen Robinson was coming back from an injury.\n\nBut Trubisky has progressed further and faster than expected, and the Bears defense is nasty enough to make up for his mistakes.\n\nTake Sunday night. Trubisky threw two interceptions, and had a couple of other passes seemingly intended for a phantom Bear that only he could see. But he made enough plays with both his feet and his arm, and the defense did the rest with a pick-six and two sacks.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 11 of the 2018 NFL season\n\nMore: NFL playoff picture after Week 11: Glut of teams tied for AFC's second wild-card spot\n\nThis was the first game in what will be a critical stretch for the Bears. They have a quick turnaround before Thursday\u2019s game in Detroit, then host the Los Angeles Rams on Dec. 9 and Green Bay the following week.\n\nThere\u2019s still a long way to go, but the Bears showed their spot atop the NFC North is no fluke.\n\nHere\u2019s what else we learned from the win:\n\n1. Cousins makes Vikings pay: Games like these are why the Minnesota Vikings broke the bank for Kirk Cousins.\n\nThey might want to ask for some of that cash back.\n\nCousins was dazzling in two fourth-quarter drives that made the final score look a lot closer than it really was. Until then, however, he was completely ineffective. Yes, the Bears defense is making a case as the best in the league, and Minnesota\u2019s offensive line was repeatedly pushed around.\n\nBut Cousins has to do better than two interceptions and a 76.5 quarterback rating. Too often he made throws where no Vikings were even close, and if he scrambled even half as much as Mitchell Trubisky, the outcome might have been vastly different.\n\nCousins and the Vikings will get another crack at the Bears in the regular-season finale and he\u2019ll have to be better. Much better.\n\n2. Clean up your act: Chicago got away with its late-game sloppiness.\n\nThis time.\n\nMinnesota scored its only touchdown on a drive that was extended by a pass interference call on Roquan Smith. The Vikings failed on the two-point conversion, but got another try with a roughing-the-passer call on Akiem Hicks and made that attempt to cut Chicago\u2019s lead to 22-14.\n\nBoth fouls were blatant. And stupid. Smart teams, teams that make deep runs in January, don\u2019t give up free plays like that.\n\n3. Nagy isn\u2019t afraid to mix it up: It was the second quarter, and Chicago was comfortably in the lead after Trubisky\u2019s 18-yard pass to Anthony Miller. The conventional wisdom would have said kick the extra point for the 10-0 lead and be done with it.\n\nBut Nagy kept his offense on the field for a two-point conversion. A two-point conversion in the second quarter? Yep.\n\nTrubisky connected with Joshua Bellamy, giving the Bears the very odd-looking 11-0 lead. But the unorthodox move made a lot more sense with just under a minute left to the half when Cody Parkey made a 41-yard field goal. That put the Bears up by two touchdowns, which, given the way the Vikings were playing, seemed almost insurmountable.\n\nNagy went for two again midway through the fourth to make it 22-6, but that was to ensure the Vikings would need two touchdowns and then some to tie the game.\n\nFollow Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Rantanen lifts Avalanche over Ducks 4-3 with 1.3 left in OT", "description": "Mikko Rantanen's power-play slap shot with 1.3 seconds on the clock in overtime gave the Colorado Avalanche a 4-3 victory over the slumping Anaheim Ducks", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/11/18/rantanen-lifts-avalanche-over-ducks-4-3-with-13-left-in-ot/38561831/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a98f5db2b89f2bc973bbd9834fbb9d0f50bf60b2/c=0-197-3778-2322/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/usatsports/b81e6ac385714433b6644d4ce3e7c234.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T04:27:56Z", "content": "Colorado Avalanche goaltender Philipp Grubauer, right, of Germany, stops a shot as Anaheim Ducks' Ryan Getzlaf, left, is held back by Avalanche's Alexander Kerfoot during the second period of an NHL hockey game Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Anaheim, Calif.

As part of their quest for answers on how and why Chinedu died, Chinedu\u2019s mother and other family members were shown the footage by the district attorney's office on Friday, Ebele Okobi, Chinedu\u2019s sister, told USA TODAY on Sunday.\n\nOkobi says it paints a deeply disturbing picture of her brother's last moments, refuting key statements from deputies, such as that her brother assaulted them. The video footage, gathered by investigators, showed him only struggling to save his own life, she said.\n\n\"They are trying to make my brother, a homicide victim, responsible for his own murder in the court of public opinion,\" said Okobi, who works as Facebook\u2019s public policy director for Africa.\n\nThe San Mateo County District Attorney, Steve Wagstaffe, who is investigating Chinedu\u2019s death and the actions of five deputies, said he would release the videos to the public after all witnesses have been interviewed so they are not influenced by seeing them.\n\n\"After our investigation is completed and I make my decision on the case, I will follow our standard procedure in this county and everything in the investigation will be available to the media and the public and anyone can review the reports, videos and form their own opinion,\" Wagstaffe told USA TODAY in an email. He said he expects to reach a decision in the next 3-4 four weeks.\n\nThe San Mateo County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Monday that it wants the videos to be released to the public as quickly as possible but it must provide the DA \"with every ability to conduct a full and complete investigation.\"\n\n\"Our hearts go out to Chinedu Okobi\u2019s family as well as everyone affected by this terrible situation,\" public information officer Rosemerry Blankswade said in an emailed statement. \"We realize that nothing we can say or do will bring back Chinedu Okobi.\"\n\nOkobi has used her platform as a prominent Facebook executive to renew national debate over the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement.\n\nOn Sunday, she said her family is lobbying for the creation of an independent police review body to investigate use of police force and officer-involved deaths, similar to those in San Francisco and San Jose. They are also calling for a moratorium on the use of Tasers until a thorough study of the policies and training is completed. Chinedu was the third unarmed person in 10 months to die after being tased in San Mateo County.\n\n\u201cNow that I have seen the video, I am so angry,\u201d Okobi wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday afternoon. \u201cIt was always wrong, it was always a tragedy, but now, knowing that there wasn\u2019t even the pretense of police stopping him \u2018for his own safety\u2019, seeing the way they tortured him to death for simply walking down the sidewalk \u2013 this is a crime.\u201d\n\nMore: Death of black man in police custody hits home at Facebook and in Silicon Valley\n\nMore: Jemel Roberson: Family demands police release name of cop who shot black security guard\n\nMore: Police killings, brutality damaging mental health of black community\n\nThe family is demanding answers to other questions they say the video footage raises. Were sheriff\u2019s deputies responding to 911 calls that Chinedu was wandering in and out of traffic? If so, they are calling on Wagstaffe\u2019s office to produce the calls. They also want any misconduct charges against the officers to be released to the public, along with the Taser records.\n\nTwo months before Chinedu\u2019s death, a Redwood City police officer tased 55-year-old Ramsay Saad multiple times following reports he had assaulted his 83-year-old mother. In January, 34-year-old Warren Ragudo, who suffered from drug addiction and mental health issues, died after Daly City police officers tased him inside his home.\n\nFollowing Okobi\u2019s death in downtown Millbrae, 20 miles south of San Francisco, the ACLU filed a public records request for the San Mateo County sheriff\u2019s use-of-force and stun gun policies.\n\nThe youngest of five siblings in a Nigerian-American family, Chinedu grew up in San Francisco's Diamond Heights neighborhood. He graduated from Morehouse, a historically black college, with a degree in business administration.

We need to catch up from our slow start. There is no magic, we just have to play fast. If we play fast, we're giving options to each other quick and we're playing our best and that's what we did tonight.\"\n\nWilliam Karlsson, Cody Eakin, Max Pacioretty and Reilly Smith also scored, Smith tacked on two assists and Colin Miller had three. The Golden Knights have won two of their last three to improve to 9-11-1.\n\nConnor McDavid, Alex Chiasson and Leon Draisaitl scored for Edmonton. The Oilers are 9-10-1 after dropping six of seven.\n\n\"Obviously it is frustrating, there is no other way to say it,\" McDavid said. \"Especially because we have shown we can be a good team. We had that 8-1-1 stretch where we looked really good and now we have wavered and find ourselves dipping a bit. We just have to get back to that brand of hockey that we know we can play.\"\n\nEakin began the second-period burst, tying it at 2 with a short-handed goal at 2:21. Pacioretty struck at 3:53, and Marchessault added a power-play goal at 4:33.\n\n\"We came out strong in the second, one thing led to another and we had a few in the back of the net, that's what we needed,\" Eakin said. \"It's been a little inconsistent and hopefully we can build a little momentum here and play the way we need to be successful.\"\n\nVegas added to its lead 34 seconds into the third on a redirect by Marchessault, his 10th, and piled on with another goal by Smith three minutes later. Edmonton got one back from Draisaitl shortly after that.\n\nEdmonton scored 52 seconds into the game on its first shot when McDavid tipped Matt Benning's shot that had goalie Marc-Andre Fleury completely going in the opposite direction. McDavid has 12 goals this season.\n\nNotes: It was the first of four meetings between the eams this season. Edmonton won three of four games last season against the reigning Western Conference champions. ... Vegas defenseman Nate Schmidt made his season debut after serving a 20-game suspension for violating the NHL/NHLPA Performance Enhancing Substances Program. ... Chiasson has eight goals in 14 games.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The slow-starting Eagles will see their season end much quicker than they anticipated if their latest performance is any indication.\n\nAnother dismal first-quarter doomed Philadelphia in a 48-7 loss to the streaking New Orleans Saints on Sunday \u2014 the most-lopsided loss ever by a defending Super Bowl champion.\n\nThe Eagles (4-6) face a tough road just to make the playoffs. Although they trail NFC East-leading Washington by only two games, their latest showing was a particularly deflating one.\n\nNone of their first five losses was by more than seven points. This one approached the franchise-record 62-10 loss to the New York Giants in 1972.\n\n\"When you get kicked in the face like we did, it's going to make you go back and look at yourself,\" offensive tackle Lane Johnson said. \"I hope it hurts everybody because I don't want to be a part of this again.\"\n\nCarson Wentz, who had labeled it a must win, was 1 for 5 for 10 yards with an interception by the start of the second quarter. Philadelphia, which entered with an NFL-low 21 points in the first quarter, did not pick up a first down on its opening two series.\n\nWentz threw his first interception on the second play of the next possession \u2014 a deep ball into double coverage that cornerback Marshon Lattimore grabbed.\n\nThe Eagles trailed 17-0 after each team had the ball three times.\n\n\"I pride myself in coming out swinging early,\" Wentz said. \"We need to be locked in, but just haven't made enough plays. It's frustrating.\"\n\nAlmost nothing went right for the Eagles, who had 196 yards of offense and were even worse defensively. The Saints scored on touchdown drives of 86, 84 and 84 yards to end the first half, reached the end zone on their first three possessions of the second half and finished with 546 yards.\n\nNew Orleans' last touchdown came on 37-yard, fourth-down pass from Drew Brees to running back Alvin Kamara in the fourth quarter. A shot-play at that point seemed unnecessary, but several Eagles said they did not take offense at the continued aggressiveness.\n\n\"I'm not going to pick and choose plays,\" defensive end Chris Long said. \"We were disrespectful to ourselves to put that effort forward. I haven't gotten my (butt) kicked like that in a long time.\"\n\nThe Eagles had one brief ray of hope, cutting their deficit to 17-7 on rookie Josh Adams' 28-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and forcing a three-and-out on the Saints' next series. But New Orleans defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins burst up the middle and sacked Wentz on third down from the Saints' 46, forcing a punt.\n\nPhiladelphia did not cross midfield again until its final drive.\n\n\"We were trying to be aggressive and take a shot down the field,\" Wentz said. \"They played a good coverage and I just didn't get it out there.\"\n\nMaking matters worse, Philadelphia's injury-riddled secondary lost two more players. The Eagles already were playing without starting cornerbacks Ronald Darby, who was lost for the season with a torn ACL last week, and Jalen Mills, who was scratched Sunday with a foot injury.\n\nAgainst the Saints, they lost safety Avonte Maddox to a knee injury in the first quarter. Cornerback Rasul Douglas then left with a knee injury in the third quarter.\n\n\"Every time you turn around, somebody's on the ground,\" Long said.\n\nWith successive divisional games against the Giants, Redskins and Cowboys coming up, the Eagles expressed hope they'd have time to turn around the season.\n\n\"The product we're putting out there is not up to our standards,\" said Wentz, who threw three interceptions and did not have a completion of more than 19 yards. \"I'm not playing to my standards, but we know the talent we have and the chemistry we have.\"\n\nThey exhibited none of those attributes Sunday.\n\n\"We can't dwell on it for seven days and let it impact next Sunday's performance,\" tight end Zach Ertz said. \"The only thing we can do right now is get on to the Giants and not let this single game lead to a spiral.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Just lucky he is on our team,\" Washington coach Mike Hopkins said.\n\nDominic Green scored 13 points off the bench for Washington (3-1) and Noah Dickerson added 11, but it was an inconsistent performance by the Huskies in the second half. Washington had plenty of chance to put away Santa Clara, leading by 19 at one point, but was sloppy enough and at times too sluggish on defense and let the Broncos hang around.\n\n\"I thought our defense was lackluster. We need to be better there,\" Hopkins said. \"For the most part we've got to be more consistent. Some of our turnovers were pretty awful and I sit there sometimes and shake my head and say 'what just happened?' But to be able to come out with a win; we've just got to keep getting better.\"\n\nJosip Vrankic led Santa Clara (0-3) with 21 points and Keshawn Justice had 15, but the Broncos didn't have the answers to slow down Nowell.\n\nSanta Clara played its first game since learning all-conference guard KJ Feagin will be out indefinitely after suffering a broken bone in his left hand during the Broncos' loss to UC Irvine last week. Feagin averaged 17.5 points per game last season, but had struggled in the first two games to start the 2018-19 season.\n\n\"I think offensively our guys tried to execute the game plan and thought they did a good job of moving the ball and playing unselfishly,\" Santa Clara coach Herb Sendek said. \"We left far too many points at the free-throw line and didn't make enough shots. I thought more than that we needed to play better than we did defensively.\"\n\nNowell carried Washington for most of the first half, scoring 12 straight during one stretch and 15 of the Huskies' first 22 points. No other Washington player had more than five points, but the Huskies still had a 42-32 lead at the break.\n\nDespite Nowell scoring with ease early, the Broncos cut Washington's lead within six several times in the latter stages of the first half, delighting the handful of supporters who showed up in vintage Steve Nash Santa Clara jerseys. But those cheers were muted after Washington scored nine of the first 11 points to start the second half. The Huskies led by as many as 19 in the early stages of the half, but Santa Clara pulled within 10 on Justice's driving layup with 5:34 left. He missed the free throw with a chance to cut the lead to nine and Willie Caruso missed another chance to get the lead in single-digits. Green hit a pair of 3s and Washington's lead was back to a comfortable margin.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSanta Clara: The Broncos are integrating eight new players from last year in Sendek's third season. Feagin was one of three rotational players returning, along with Vrankic and Henrik Jadersten. ... The Broncos were just 12 of 21 at the free-throw line and 4 of 19 on 3-pointers.\n\nWashington: The Huskies improved to 6-1 all-time against Santa Clara and are 2-0 this season against West Coast Conference teams having beat San Diego. ... The Huskies were 26 of 34 at the free-throw line. ... Guard Matisse Thybulle suffered an ankle injury in practice on Saturday and was limited to 23 minutes. He scored two points.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nWashington was ranked No. 25 in the preseason AP Top 25, but fell out of the poll after losing at Auburn. It's unlikely two wins over WCC teams will push Washington back into the Top 25 on Monday, but sweeping all three games in Vancouver might be enough the following week.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSanta Clara: The Broncos face Minnesota on Tuesday.\n\nWashington: The Huskies face Texas A&M on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college basketball coverage: http://collegebasketball.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Mitch Haaseth, ABC)\n\nSeason 10 may be a decade of dreams, but this hopeful broom entrepreneur was in for a rude awakening on Sunday's \u201cShark Tank,\u201d which for the first time in the show\u2019s history featured three female sharks in the tank.\n\nRegular sharks Lori Greiner and Barbara Corcoran were joined by guest shark Sara Blakely, the creator of the undergarment company Spanx. The milestone wasn\u2019t lost on the three. \u201cLadies,\u201d Greiner and Blakely exclaimed to each other, before Corcoran concluded, \u201cDon\u2019t say ladies. Say majority.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Eben Dobson III, the creator of the Wisp Broom, the three weren\u2019t swept away by his presentation, and neither were fellow sharks Mark Cuban and Kevin O\u2019Leary. While the sharks were impressed with the actual product, a lightweight broom designed to make sweeping easier, Dobson stumbled out of the gate asking for $500,000 for a 10 percent investment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of Wisping,\u201d Cuban deadpanned under his breath.\n\nEben Dobson III, an entrepreneur from San Marcos, California, pitches his one-handed pull broom and dustpan to wary sharks on ABC's 'Shark Tank.'

That number soon grew worse when the sharks learned Dobson had invested $2.1 million in the company and made a profit of just $50,000 in the company\u2019s six year history.\n\n\u201cI think you get an A for effort, and an F for execution,\u201d Corcoran said.\n\n\u201cI like your product. I\u2019m going to buy your product, but I am not going to invest in your company today,\u201d Blakely agreed.\n\nMistakes were clearly made. Dobson would be the first to admit it. Shifting in step and nervously pushing his broom around, it was apparent what Dobson really needed was a partner. Cue, Mr. Wonderful. O\u2019Leary stepped in, offering him the $500,000 to become equal partners.\n\n\u201cThe product clearly works,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThat\u2019s the intriguing part, but year after year after year, you\u2019ve made no money. That\u2019s very depressing. The question is, do you need adult supervision so you can get focused on one thing.\u201d\n\nThe question was less would Dobson take the deal and more could he? With 22 investors and $250,000 of debt already on the company, it would be a hard sell. Greiner even offered to help peddle the product if O\u2019Leary fronted the money, but O\u2019Leary wasn\u2019t interested in partnering up.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want to include Lori?\u201d Dobson asked.\n\n\u201cI might, but she\u2019s not putting up any money right now, so I\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d O\u2019Leary responded, wanting to know if they had a deal or not.\n\n\u201cOK we\u2019ll do it,\u201d Dobson said. The \"Shark Tank\" theme music played as O\u2019Leary rose to shake hands with Dobson. \u201cBut \u2026\u201d\n\nO\u2019Leary sat back down. The music stopped. The camera focused on an increasingly nervous Dobson, who was still caught up in whether Greiner was included in the deal or not.\n\nAn angry O\u2019Leary retracted the offer and told Dobson to grab his broom and get out.\n\nAs the still-rattled broom salesman walked down the hall, he shook his head and said, \u201cThat could have gone better.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Barbara Corcoran built a real estate empire before moving on to ABC\u2019s Shark Tank as an investor.

(AP Photo/Kelvin Kuo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCARSON, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Philip Rivers' arm was already in motion when he realized Von Miller had read him like a book again. The Broncos' superstar linebacker was about to jump another screen route for his second interception.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers' quarterback couldn't stop his final throw with 1:58 to play. He only managed to guide it into the ground for a clock-stopping incompletion on third down.\n\nRivers left the field enormously frustrated. The Chargers (7-3) were about to feel a whole lot worse.\n\n\"I've got to pull the ball back and take a sack or find a way to complete it,\" Rivers said. \"(But) we shouldn't have been in that situation. It should have been about 33-7 at that point.\"\n\nRivers' incompletion meant Denver got 111 seconds to make its final drive, instead of only 70 seconds or so if Rivers had simply knelt down while the Broncos were out of timeouts.\n\nThe Broncos made every last second count, hitting a field goal as time expired for a 23-22 victory that ended the Chargers' six-game winning streak in crushing fashion.\n\n\"That's one where, you know, (Rivers) probably should have just ate it,\" coach Anthony Lynn said.\n\nInstead, the Chargers got a cold slap of reality when their impressive roll through the middle of the season ended in gut-wrenching fashion. The Bolts had multiple opportunities to put away the Broncos while outgaining them 479-325 and keeping the ball for nearly 38 minutes, but LA was undone by turnovers, penalties, mental errors, a replay review, a fake punt and just about any other mistake you can conjure under the California sun.\n\n\"When you make some errors we made today in critical moments, you open yourselves up to get beat, and that's what happened today,\" Rivers said. \"We had every opportunity to close it out, and we just didn't get it done.\"\n\nAfter spending the previous five weeks on the road, the Chargers lost at home for only the second time in nine games since Oct. 1, 2017. Lynn saw plenty of blame to be distributed throughout his roster after his team's first loss anywhere since Sept. 23.\n\nA fairly disciplined team committed a whopping 14 penalties for 120 yards. They ranged from the bizarre \u2014 Keenan Allen getting an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after his TD reception for trying on a championship belt held by a fan in the end zone stands \u2014 to the tired monotony of ordinary discipline lapses, including seven penalties in the first quarter alone.\n\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" Lynn said after the Chargers racked up the most penalties of his 26-game tenure. \"Those are things that we've stayed away from: penalties and turnovers. They showed up today, and for whatever reason, I don't know. We'll figure it out, though.\"\n\nFor the second straight week, the Chargers' special-teamers were fooled by a fake punt \u2014 and Denver scored its first touchdown on the next snap in the second quarter. Mike Badgley also missed the Chargers' NFL-worst seventh extra point.\n\nRivers passed for 401 yards with two touchdowns, but the veteran also had multiple interceptions for the first time since a loss at Kansas City last December.\n\nThe Chargers were up 19-7 and driving in Broncos territory late in the third quarter when Miller jumped a screen and returned his interception 42 yards , setting up a Denver TD just three plays later.\n\nAfter the teams traded the lead early in the fourth quarter, the Chargers thought they had forced a game-deciding turnover twice \u2014 only to see a fumble turned into an incomplete pass by video review, followed by an interception that was wiped out by a defensive holding penalty with 4:40 to play.\n\nEven after all of that, Los Angeles still needed just one score, one big play \u2014 even three yards and a cloud of dust.\n\nOn their final drive, the Bolts had a second-and-3 play near midfield with 2:39 to play, needing only a first down to wrap it up. But after Denver's final timeout, running back Melvin Gordon simply went the wrong way on a running play, and Rivers was forced to take a sack before the two-minute warning.\n\n\"Ain't no excuses for it,\" Gordon said. \"It's the down to go get it to win the game. You just can't make that mistake, and I did today. ... It's just puzzling and just frustrating. We know we could have won this game. We should have won this game, and everybody in this locker room knows that. We fell short.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

So, of course, this is the toughest stretch we've been in,\" coach Steve Kerr said. \"This is the real NBA. We haven't been in the real NBA the last few years. We've been in this dream. So, now we're faced with real adversity. We've got to get out of it ourselves.\"\n\nStephen Curry and Draymond Green went down with injuries during the recent dry spell, but the biggest setback was self-inflicted. Green and Kevin Durant had a blowup at the close of regulation in a 121-116 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers last Monday. Green's tirades on the bench and in the postgame locker room led the team to hand the seventh-year forward a one-game suspension.\n\nThe flare-up and the Warriors' inability to move past it spiritually has confounded Kerr.\n\n\"Just play with joy. It's always been about just our emotion,\" Durant said, describing how Kerr has encouraged his club. \"He's always been big about that. He's just trying to get that joy back.\"\n\nThere wasn't much joy to be found in San Antonio.\n\nDeMar DeRozan had 20 points and nine assists and Rudy Gay added 19 points to help the Spurs snap a three-game slide.\n\n\"We needed that one,\" Gay said. \"It was a hard-fought win for us. That's a team that needed this one, too, so it really was an uphill battle for us and good test for us.\"\n\nAldridge provided a needed boost, shooting 10 for 16 in scoring 20-plus points for the first time since Nov. 10.\n\n\"He's been aggressive, especially on the boards,\" DeRozan said. \"Tonight he got a couple shots to go in for him. A couple of his turnarounds went in, and you know that rhythm is going to continue to come. As long as he just goes out there, plays aggressive, lets the game come to him, he's going to continue to have big nights like tonight.\"\n\nDurant scored 26 points and Klay Thompson had 25 for the Warriors.\n\nGolden State was without Curry and Green again, and their absence led to a cold start. Three nights after being held to a season-low output in a 107-86 loss at Houston, the Warriors nearly matched that dubious mark.\n\nThey missed all six 3-point attempts in the first quarter as San Antonio jumped out to a 33-27 lead. Gay scored 12 points in the opening period.\n\n\"He is somebody that we have gone to at certain times in the game and that always gives players confidence,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.\n\nSan Antonio also frustrated the Warriors on offense for much of the game. After quickly regaining an errant pass on their end of the court in the third quarter, Durant passed up a 3-pointer to fire a pass in the lane to Damian Jones only to have Gay stuff him at the rim.\n\nSan Antonio finished with five blocked shots.\n\nGolden State's lone lead came when Andre Iguodala made two free throws to put the Warriors ahead 46-45 with 3:47 remaining in the second quarter. The lead lasted a minute as the Spurs closed the first half on an 11-2 run.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nWarriors: Curry, the two-time MVP, missed his sixth straight game with a strained left groin. Golden State is 2-4 without him. ... Green missed his second consecutive game with a strained right toe. ... Kerr got a technical foul 47 seconds into the second quarter after protesting a foul on Jonas Jerebko. ... Durant was called for a technical after complaining about a non-call on his first field goal attempt of the second half.\n\nSpurs: San Antonio has had a winning record for 3,355 days since 1997, most of any team in the league. Dallas is second at 2,407, followed by Houston with 2,340. . Aldridge has 202 games with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds since 2006. LeBron James has 203 such games during that same span. ... Pau Gasol missed his sixth straight game with a sore left foot. ... Davis Bertans sat out as he remains in the league's concussion protocol.\n\nPACK A LUNCH\n\nKerr was asked if he planned to give Golden State a day off Monday following a three-game road trip as it prepares to host Oklahoma City on Wednesday.\n\nNo way, he joked.\n\n\"They'll have a two-a-day tomorrow,\" Kerr said. \"I'm going back to the old days, Bobby Knight style.\"\n\nThe Warriors are off Monday.\n\nNOT SO BAD\n\nDeRozan experienced his first slump with the Spurs since joining the team in an offseason trade from Toronto. Popovich's attitude during the skid left DeRozan a bit surprised.\n\n\"He was more patient than I expected,\" DeRozan said. \"But like I said, we all have that feeling of understanding a lot of things are new. I know we keep saying it, but we're definitely making progress when we're going out there and playing. Very aggressive. We all want the same thing; we're all cheering for one another. It's just once we're more consistent with things defensively, you'll start to see games like tonight happen more often.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWarriors: Host Oklahoma City on Wednesday night.\n\nSpurs: At New Orleans on Monday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

That's the way it goes.\u201d\n\nTruex held the lead before Logano passed his No. 78 Furniture Row Racing Toyota with 11 laps left.

He led late in the race, but it was on a pit strategy that needed a lucky caution to give him any chance to win. Busch got that yellow when JGR teammate Daniel Suarez was spun out with 20 laps left.\n\nBusch exited pit row first, a lead he lost almost immediately after the race went green.\n\nMartin Truex Jr. (78) pased Kyle Busch (18) on the final restart as Joey Logano (22) and Kevin Harvick close in during the Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway.

I\u2019m not sure what happened and where we missed it.\u201d\n\nHarvick, who qualified lowest among the Championship 4 (12th), was a factor early in the race, leading the second-most laps (58).

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Ford slammed the door on NASCAR's longest championship drought when Joey Logano drove a Fusion to victory in its final race.\n\nLogano won Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway to give the American automaker its eighth drivers' title, but first since Kurt Busch in 2004. Ford also won the manufacturers' title, the first time it has won the top two prizes in NASCAR in a season since 1999.\n\nFord had two of the four entries in the championship field, one each from Team Penske and Stewart-Haas Racing, the teams it recruited to end its championship slide. The crown went to Roger Penske, a longtime Ford supporter and friend of Edsel Ford II, grandson of Henry Ford.\n\n\"Delivering the manufacturers' championship and the driver's championship, where it's been a drought for them and for Edsel,\" Penske said, \"and all the people that have done so much at Ford, and they've stayed committed with us. This is part of building a brand.\"\n\nPenkse and Edsel Ford shared the championship moment in victory lane. Team Penske returned to the Ford brand in 2013 and has been the cornerstone of the blue oval groups bid to challenge Chevrolet and Toyota for tops in NASCAR.\n\n\"It means a lot to me personally to have both the drivers' and manufacturers' championship,\" Ford said. \"It has been since 1999 and I was there with Robert Yates and Dale Jarrett. Doing it again, 19 years later, it is absolutely indescribable to me.\"\n\nFord led all three manufacturers with 19 wins in 2018, including eight by Kevin Harvick, four by Brad Keselowski, three by Logano, two by Clint Bowyer and one from Aric Almirola and Kurt Busch.\n\n\"This means so much for Ford Motor Company and all of our employees that work so hard,\" said Mark Rushbrook, global director for Ford Performance. \"I just can't believe this right now.

Washington needs a new backup for starting QB Colt McCoy. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) November 18, 2018\n\nSome tough names there. Let\u2019s break them down.\n\nMark Sanchez\n\nSanchez, who was a backup on the Bears last season, hasn\u2019t played in an NFL game since 2016 when he was with the Cowboys. He hasn\u2019t won an NFL game since 2014 when he went 4-4 as a starter for the Eagles. His last TD pass came in 2015.\n\nTJ Yates\n\nYates went 0-3 as a starter last year with the Texans and hasn\u2019t won a game since he went 2-0 as a starter with the Texans in 2015. He\u2019s started just 10 games in his 7-year career and has thrown more INTs (11) than TDs (10) in that time.\n\nEJ Manuel\n\nManuel was a first round pick by the Buffalo Bills in 2013 but his career has been a disappointment. He\u2019s only started two games since 2016 and hasn\u2019t won a game since 2014. He\u2019s also throw just 4 TD passes since 2015.\n\nSo yeah, not a solid group coming in to potentially help the NFC East leaders."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Late penalties, mistakes doom Cardinals in loss to Raiders", "description": "Late penalties, mistakes doom Cardinals in loss to Raiders", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/18/late-penalties-mistakes-doom-cardinals-in-loss-to-raiders/38561333/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16681b12bdd9161e059098b690aa56e8cf599097/c=0-300-2915-1940/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/usatsports/3854f3eb684346c19d9f70cbe7f50417.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T02:23:33Z", "content": "The Oakland Raiders celebrate as time expires during the second half of an NFL football game against the Arizona Cardinals, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Glendale, Ariz.

Peterson's 3- and 7-yard TD runs gave him 105 in his career and moved him past former Redskins star John Riggins into sole possession of sixth, one behind Hall of Famer Jim Brown for fifth. Pittsburgh rallied from a 16-0 deficit for a 20-16 victory for its sixth straight victory. ... The Giants beat the Buccaneers 38-25 for their second consecutive victory, the first time they've won consecutive games since December 2016. The loss was the fourth in a row for the Bucs. ...

(AP Photo/Willie J. Allen Jr.) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Aaron Gordon dunked for the Orlando Magic just 20 seconds into the game, and the New York Knicks never caught up.\n\nGordon scored 20 of his 31 points in the first quarter and the Magic held off two New York rallies to beat the skidding Knicks 131-117 on Sunday night.\n\nNikola Vucevic had 28 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for Orlando, which has won seven of nine.\n\nThe Magic shot 57 percent and set a season high for points, surpassing the 130 they put up Saturday night against the Los Angeles Lakers. It's the first time in franchise history Orlando has scored 130 in consecutive games.\n\n\"I guess it's just the ball movement,\" said Gordon, who made 13 of 17 shots. \"The ball was sticking a little bit earlier in the year, and the ball is jumping around the court. Everybody's passing and making the right reads all over the floor.\"\n\nTim Hardaway Jr. scored 32 for the Knicks, who lost their fifth straight. Trey Burke added 31 and Enes Kanter finished with 21 points and 19 rebounds.\n\nOrlando made its first 10 shots (seven by Gordon) and led 28-10 when D.J. Augustin hit a 3-pointer midway through the first quarter. Gordon had 20 points when he took a seat on the bench with 3:54 left in the period.\n\n\"It's one quarter every game,\" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. \"If you go back through all of them it's one quarter where the doors get blown off. I can't put my thumb on it. It's different mistakes every game, but it's a quarter. Somehow I've got to get it to where we can get 48 minutes out of this group.\"\n\nBurke and Kanter came off the bench to get the Knicks back in it quickly. Burke scored 16 points in the first half and Kanter had 14 points and 16 rebounds, including nine at the offensive end. Noah Vonleh closed the first half with a 3 to leave the Knicks down 67-66.\n\nA layup by Gordon got Orlando's lead back up to 12 in the third quarter, but Burke and Hardaway answered with all of New York's points in an 11-2 run.\n\nJonathan Isaac's big fourth quarter for Orlando included a block of Hardaway that led to a fast break and a dunk that left the Magic ahead 116-104 with 5:27 left.\n\nHEATING UP\n\nAfter their first eight games, the Magic were 2-6 and last in the NBA with a .414 field goal percentage. In the nine games since, they've shot 49.7 percent. \"Definitely our purpose of play is good,\" coach Steve Clifford said. \"We're making a bunch of shots and Vucevic is just playing at an incredibly high level.\"\n\nFRIGHT NIGHT\n\nThe Knicks did not face Gordon when the teams played a week ago in New York, but they saw plenty of him in the rematch Sunday. \"That was no fun,\" Fizdale said. \"Aaron Gordon is one of the top 1 percent of athletes in this league. The fact he's now making his 3s, with that athleticism and his ability to put the ball on the floor, that's a scary thought.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nKnicks: C Mitchell Robinson, who blocked nine Magic shots last Sunday, went to the bench with four fouls with 2:11 left in the second quarter. He played 75 seconds in the second half. ... F Mario Hezonga sat out a second straight game with what Fizdale described as \"either a stomach flu or food poisoning.\" Hezonga played three seasons in Orlando after being drafted fifth overall in 2015.\n\nMagic: Matched a franchise record for one quarter with 44 points in the first. The mark was set against the Lakers on Feb. 8, 2008. ... Vucevic has averaged 25.5 points (on 59 percent shooting) and 11.7 rebounds in the last six games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKnicks: Home against Portland on Tuesday night.\n\nMagic: Home against Toronto on Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Mitch Stringer, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAll season long, the Baltimore Ravens have offered glimpses of Lamar Jackson's play-making ability. But until starting quarterback Joe Flacco's hip injury forced him to miss Sunday's game, no one really had any idea how valuable a fantasy player Jackson could be.\n\nThe rookie first-round pick wasn't spectacular, but he showed some serious upside as a two-way threat on offense. Jackson ran for 117 yards on 27 carries -- breaking Tim Tebow's single-game mark for the most rushing attempts by a quarterback in the Super Bowl era -- and also threw for 150 more yards in leading the Ravens to a win over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nGames with 117+ rushing yards and 117+ passing yards:\n\n\n\nMichael Vick - 3\n\nRandall Cunningham - 2\n\nColin Kaepernick - 2\n\nLamar Jackson - 1 \u2014 Football Perspective (@fbgchase) November 18, 2018\n\nJackson didn't have a touchdown, so his fantasy production was limited (15.7 FP) and he could end up being a one-week anomaly if Flacco is healthy enough to start next week vs. Oakland.\n\nHowever, his running ability gives him an added dimension no other current quarterback has. Fantasy owners should be sufficiently intrigued by his first NFL start.\n\nBackup QBs abound\n\nJackson wasn't the only backup quarterback thrust into action in Week 11.\n\n-- The Washington Redskins lost starter Alex Smith to a broken leg in the third quarter of their game against the Houston Texans. The fractures to both his fibula and tibia end Smith's season.\n\nColt McCoy led a pair of scoring drives, including a touchdown pass to tight end Jordan Reed, and finished the game with 54 yards passing and 35 rushing.\n\nMcCoy, 32, hasn't played much in the regular season since he made a few starts in 2014. He's a competent backup, but all of Washington's skill players (with the possible exception of Reed) lose fantasy value with McCoy under center the rest of the way.\n\n-- It wasn't an injury, but ineffectiveness that sent Ryan Fitzpatrick to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers bench just after halftime. Fitzpatrick threw for 167 yards and ran for a touchdown, but his three interceptions -- including one that was returned for a score -- was enough for the Bucs to bring back Jameis Winston.\n\nWinston, who lost his starting job two weeks ago, threw for 199 yards and two touchdowns. It wouldn't be a surprise to see him back as the starter next week.\n\n-- The Tennessee Titans changed quarterbacks at halftime of their lopsided loss to the Indianapolis Colts as Blaine Gabbert replaced Marcus Mariota. There's a chance Mariota's elbow injury prevents him from starting next week, but it's too early to know just yet.\n\nEagles clipped\n\nWhat looked like an offensive shootout turned out to be a one-sided rout in New Orleans. The Saints' Drew Brees threw for 363 yards and four touchdowns in a 48-7 laugher.\n\nMeanwhile, the Philadelphia Eagles couldn't get anything going on offense. Quarterback Carson Wentz scored the exact same number of fantasy points as Saints backup Taysom Hill (0.8).\n\nDespite the blowout with plenty of garbage-time opportunity, Wentz threw for a mere 156 yards and no touchdowns. He also was intercepted three times.\n\nNo Eagle had more than 50 yards receiving, including last week's superstar, tight end Zach Ertz -- who posted two receptions for 15 yards.\n\nIt's entirely fair to say the Eagles, collectively, laid an egg.\n\nBroad Shoulders Award\n\nOn the other hand, our weekly honor for the player who single-handedly carried his fantasy owners to victory goes to Indianapolis Colts wide receiver T.Y. Hilton.\n\nThe speedy wideout got things rolling with a 68-yard touchdown reception from Andrew Luck and added another score later in the game. He caught all nine of his targets for 155 yards and a 36.5 fantasy points (PPR scoring).\n\nHilton barely edged out stud running backs Saquon Barkley (35.2) and Ezekiel Elliott (33.1) for Sunday's highest fantasy point total.\n\nEarly waiver wire\n\nDepending on what the Ravens decide to do with their quarterback situation, Lamar Jackson could be a worthwhile pickup coming off his promising performance vs. Cincinnati. Baltimore has an extremely favorable schedule with games against the Raiders, Falcons, Chiefs and Buccaneers up next.\n\nSomewhat overshadowed by Jackson, fellow rookie Gus Edwards saw his first extensive action of the season at running back and looked fantastic. He had 17 carries for 115 yards and a touchdown -- plus, he scored on a two-point conversion.\n\nSaints rookie wide receiver Tre'Quan Smith might have been cut loose after going without a catch in Week 10 and not having more than three receptions in a game all season. If that's the case, he'll be a hot pickup this week following a 10-catch, 157-yard effort with a touchdown against the Eagles.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner on Twitter @SteveAGardner.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 There was a time when LeBron James getting pestered by Lance Stephenson would have worked out wonderfully for the Miami Heat.\n\nSunday was not one of those times.\n\nThe scenario: It was late in the game, the outcome was decided, and Stephenson \u2014 James' former rival, now his teammate with the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 challenged him to finish the game off with a 3-pointer.\n\n\"I bet you won't go for the 3,\" Stephenson said.\n\nThe Heat probably wish that conversation never took place. James' capped his 51-point night with a 32-foot 3-pointer in the final seconds, pointed at Stephenson to let him know he was wrong, and the Lakers rolled past the Heat 113-97 for their seventh win in their last nine games.\n\nJames reached 50 for the 13th time in his career, including Game 1 of last season's NBA Finals.\n\n\"It's just playing with greatness,\" Lakers guard Lonzo Ball said. \"Tonight he took the game over.\"\n\nJames shot 19 for 31 from the field, 6 for 8 from 3-point range, became the seventh player to score at least 51 in a game against Miami, and started his two-game reunion tour in sensational fashion. The Lakers' next game is Wednesday night in Cleveland, the only other place besides Miami and L.A. that James has called home as a professional.\n\n\"It's always great to be here,\" said James, who hugged a slew of familiar faces in the arena he used to call home. \"We had some not-so-good times, we had more great times, so it's always a respect factor and a love for the people in Miami and especially the people who work here.\"\n\nAnd finally, he left Miami a winner again. Since leaving the Heat after the 2014 NBA Finals James was 0-4 against Miami; his teams were 0-7, when including the three Cleveland-Miami games that he sat out for various reasons.\n\nJames put on a show.\n\nThe Heat threw a shoe.\n\nIt was their fourth straight home loss and frustrations boiled over. Josh Richardson got ejected in the fourth quarter after throwing one of his sneakers into the stands, upset about a call that he felt he didn't get moments earlier.\n\n\"I just can't let that happen,\" Richardson said.\n\nWayne Ellington scored 19 points for Miami (6-10), which is off to its second-worst start in the last 12 years. The Heat were 5-11 at this point of the 2016-17 season, the only other time they've been worse after 16 games in that span.\n\nRichardson and Tyler Johnson each scored 17 points for the Heat, while Rodney McGruder added 14.\n\n\"We're going to get to work,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra vowed.\n\nThey need some health, too. Goran Dragic missed the game for Miami because of a right knee problem, one that will be further evaluated Monday. Dwyane Wade remained on leave after the birth of his daughter, and may return to the Heat this week.\n\nMiami hasn't forgotten James, obviously \u2014 he still gets loud cheers when introduced in his former home arena \u2014 but just in case anyone in attendance needed a reminder of his game, he delivered. He made eight of his first nine shots and had the whole arsenal working; dunks in transition, stepback 3-pointers, turnarounds from the baseline.\n\n\"When he's hitting shots like that, what do you want us to do?\" Heat center Hassan Whiteside mused.\n\nEven with James' greatness, the biggest shot for the Lakers might have come from Brandon Ingram with 3:46 left. Miami had clawed within eight and the shot clock was about to expire on the Lakers, but Ingram connected on a long jumper from the left wing to make it 104-94.\n\nFrom there, the only drama was whether James would get 50. And he did.\n\n\"Just give him the ball,\" Lakers guard Kyle Kuzma said, \"and get out of the way.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nLakers: The Lakers arrived Saturday night after playing in Orlando and aren't scheduled to fly to Cleveland until Tuesday. ... Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 19 points, Kuzma scored 15 and Ingram finished with 13.\n\nHeat: The last time Miami lost four straight at home was early in the 2014-15 season.... Miami had a five-shot possession in the third quarter, four offensive rebounds coming before Ellington made a 3-pointer.\n\nCONSISTENT LEBRON\n\nWhenever James changes teams \u2014 Cleveland to Miami in 2010, Miami to Cleveland in 2014, Cleveland to the Lakers this past summer \u2014 his new team starts 9-7.\n\nHEAT HELP\n\nJames Johnson played for the first time this season after finally being declared good to go following offseason sports hernia surgery. He had four fouls in the first half and finished with eight points.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLakers: Visit Cleveland on Wednesday night.\n\nHeat: Host Brooklyn on Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

As part of their quest for answers on how and why Chinedu died, Chinedu\u2019s mother and other family members were shown the footage by the district attorney's office on Friday, Ebele Okobi, Chinedu\u2019s sister, told USA TODAY on Sunday.\n\nOkobi says it paints a deeply disturbing picture of her brother's last moments, refuting key statements from deputies, such as that her brother assaulted them. The video footage, gathered by investigators, showed him only struggling to save his own life, she said.\n\n\"They are trying to make my brother, a homicide victim, responsible for his own murder in the court of public opinion,\" said Okobi, who works as Facebook\u2019s public policy director for Africa.\n\nThe San Mateo County District Attorney, Steve Wagstaffe, who is investigating Chinedu\u2019s death and the actions of five deputies, said he would release the videos to the public after all witnesses have been interviewed so they are not influenced by seeing them.\n\n\"After our investigation is completed and I make my decision on the case, I will follow our standard procedure in this county and everything in the investigation will be available to the media and the public and anyone can review the reports, videos and form their own opinion,\" Wagstaffe told USA TODAY in an email. He said he expects to reach a decision in the next 3-4 four weeks.\n\nThe San Mateo County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Monday that it wants the videos to be released to the public as quickly as possible but it must provide the DA \"with every ability to conduct a full and complete investigation.\"\n\n\"Our hearts go out to Chinedu Okobi\u2019s family as well as everyone affected by this terrible situation,\" public information officer Rosemerry Blankswade said in an emailed statement. \"We realize that nothing we can say or do will bring back Chinedu Okobi.\"\n\nOkobi has used her platform as a prominent Facebook executive to renew national debate over the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement.\n\nOn Sunday, she said her family is lobbying for the creation of an independent police review body to investigate use of police force and officer-involved deaths, similar to those in San Francisco and San Jose. They are also calling for a moratorium on the use of Tasers until a thorough study of the policies and training is completed. Chinedu was the third unarmed person in 10 months to die after being tased in San Mateo County.\n\n\u201cNow that I have seen the video, I am so angry,\u201d Okobi wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday afternoon. \u201cIt was always wrong, it was always a tragedy, but now, knowing that there wasn\u2019t even the pretense of police stopping him \u2018for his own safety\u2019, seeing the way they tortured him to death for simply walking down the sidewalk \u2013 this is a crime.\u201d\n\nMore: Death of black man in police custody hits home at Facebook and in Silicon Valley\n\nMore: Jemel Roberson: Family demands police release name of cop who shot black security guard\n\nMore: Police killings, brutality damaging mental health of black community\n\nThe family is demanding answers to other questions they say the video footage raises. Were sheriff\u2019s deputies responding to 911 calls that Chinedu was wandering in and out of traffic? If so, they are calling on Wagstaffe\u2019s office to produce the calls. They also want any misconduct charges against the officers to be released to the public, along with the Taser records.\n\nTwo months before Chinedu\u2019s death, a Redwood City police officer tased 55-year-old Ramsay Saad multiple times following reports he had assaulted his 83-year-old mother. In January, 34-year-old Warren Ragudo, who suffered from drug addiction and mental health issues, died after Daly City police officers tased him inside his home.\n\nFollowing Okobi\u2019s death in downtown Millbrae, 20 miles south of San Francisco, the ACLU filed a public records request for the San Mateo County sheriff\u2019s use-of-force and stun gun policies.\n\nThe youngest of five siblings in a Nigerian-American family, Chinedu grew up in San Francisco's Diamond Heights neighborhood. He graduated from Morehouse, a historically black college, with a degree in business administration. His dreams of \"taking over the world,\" were waylaid by struggles with mental health issues but he still held down a steady job, attended church regularly, wrote poetry and had a child, his sister says.\n\nOkobi says she hopes her brother\u2019s death will raise awareness outside the African-American community among people who\u2019ve never been personally touched by police brutality, persuading them to ask tough questions, rather than discount, the deaths of unarmed black people in police custody.\n\n\u201cWe know that this is going on all around the country: police brutality, police killings. People who are new to this should not brush off these killings. They should continue to ask questions. They shouldn\u2019t accept the police narrative,\u201d she told USA TODAY. \u201cImagine what it is to live like this, to know that you can be killed, and a story will be told to blame you for your death and everyone will just move on.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/18/facebook-exec-wants-independent-probe-into-death-unarmed-brother/2051037002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Mike Jones, USA TODAY", "title": "After first start, Lamar Jackson leaves Ravens with plenty of questions in QB riddle", "description": "Lamar Jackson powered the Ravens to a win over the Bengals, but it's not clear that he's ready to take over the reins at quarterback just yet.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/mike-jones/2018/11/18/lamar-jackson-baltimore-ravens-joe-flacco-quarterback/2051412002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/53f4bc04-c132-4122-9571-555c342ab51c-USATSI_11693974.jpg?crop=4487,2524,x0,y108&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T01:31:22Z", "content": "Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson (8) rushes during the fourth quarter against the Cincinnati Bengals at M&amp;T Bank Stadium.

(Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBALTIMORE \u2013 Lamar Jackson slouched in a chair, still fully dressed in a sweat-soaked, grass-stained all-black uniform, listening as his head coach stood at the podium a few feet away and gushed about the quarterback\u2019s play in the first start of his career.\n\n\u201cI thought he played spectacular,\u201d John Harbaugh said emphatically following the Baltimore Ravens\u2019 24-21 win over the Cincinnati Bengals at M&T Bank Stadium. \u201cI thought he played winning football. It\u2019s tough being a quarterback in this league. It\u2019s tough against a defense like that. \u2026 I thought he played very poised.\"\n\nAfter nine weeks as a backup used as an occasional gadget player, Jackson \u2013 the No. 32 overall pick of this year\u2019s draft \u2013 finally got his shot with starter Joe Flacco sidelined by a hip injury. Jackson delivered a valiant effort. But his performance was anything but traditional.\n\nJackson carried the ball a whopping 27 times for 117 yards to lead a rushing attack that racked up 265 yards against the Bengals' defense. (The 27 attempts set a modern-day NFL record for a quarterback and were the most overall since Pittsburgh\u2019s Joe Geri ran 29 times in 1950).\n\nMore: NFL playoff picture after Week 11: Glut of teams tied for AFC's second wild-card spot\n\nMore: Redskins QB Alex Smith out for season with broken leg\n\nJackson also completed 13 of 19 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. But it was the outcome that mattered: a divisional victory to snap a three-game losing streak, improving the Ravens\u2019 record to 5-5 and keeping them in the hunt for a playoff berth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jackson said when asked for his thoughts once he finally took the podium. \u201cCame out with a win. It was pretty good, I guess.\u201d\n\nJackson did what he was asked to do on Sunday. He stuck to the game plan and took what his offensive coordinator and the defense gave him. But he explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would run the ball that much, but whatever it takes to win.\u201d\n\nJust as Jackson gave the M&T Stadium crowd a spark when he trotted onto the field for his first series (drawing a standing ovation from many fans), he gave his team as a whole a much-needed jolt, Ravens players said. His athleticism had a dizzying effect on the Bengals defenders, who struggled to figure out who to key on during the many read-option plays that Jackson directed. If it wasn\u2019t Jackson racing past them on keepers on the edge or up the middle, it was running back Gus Edwards \u2013 an undrafted rookie from Rutgers \u2013 who racked up 115 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries.\n\nThe tandem paved the way for 265 total rushing yards, and Ravens topped the 400 total yards for the first time in five games and for only the fourth time this season. There was no denying Baltimore had the look and feel of a high school attack more than that of a professional offense. Jackson\u2019s longest pass traveled just 23 yards.\n\nThe Ravens coaches didn\u2019t care about style points. Because the Bengals had no answer for Jackson and Co., Ravens offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg kept calling run-pass option plays again and again. And Jackson ran, ran and ran some more.\n\n\u201cWe were just looking for an edge of some kind,\u201d wide receiver Willie Snead admitted. \u201cFour-and-5 (coming in), and we were itching for a victory, like I said. So, Lamar came in and gave that spark to the offense, as you all see.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh acknowledged after the game, \u201cFirst time being back up here after a win. I want you to know that it feels good.\u201d\n\nBut once the relief of the snapped losing streak subsides, the Ravens will have a fair amount of questions on their hands. Critics have been calling for a change at quarterback, but it\u2019s hard to say that Jackson completely validated any potential decision to bench Flacco long term.\n\nThe Bengals, who gave up more than 500 yards in their three previous games and were on pace to break the record for most yards allowed in a season, aren\u2019t a good barometer for Jackson\u2019s capabilities as a full-time starter.\n\nFlacco sounds like a long shot to return by next week\u2019s game against Oakland, so that\u2019s one matter Harbaugh and his assistants won\u2019t have to address for now. But the next two games feature potential shootouts with Matt Ryan and the Falcons and Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Sunday\u2019s run-heavy game plan is sustainable against those teams. If Andy Dalton had Pro Bowl receiver A.J. Green at his disposal, the Bengals very well may have mustered more than just 21 points and 255 total yards, and Sunday\u2019s game might have turned out much differently.\n\nAgainst more prolific offenses, the Ravens will have had to ask Jackson to pass more. The rookie said he has no problem doing so, and he even said he wants to \u201csit back and throw the ball\u201d to avoid subjecting himself to risk of injury.\n\nIt didn\u2019t appear that his coaches, however, had confidence in Jackson to put him in that kind of passing role. When they did call pass plays, they opted for quick-hitters designed to get the ball out of his hands quickly rather than having him sit and work his way through progressions. Jackson threw an interception when he made a split-second choice to abandon a run and instead chucked the ball downfield. And he did demonstrate an ability to rebound from adversity. But he still must show more, both to his coaches, and his teammates.\n\nThe run-heavy scheme proved frustrating to Ravens receivers during the game.\n\nSnead was irate over a call for a keeper on a key fourth-quarter play sequence near the goal line. Instead of taking a shot to the end zone, Mornhinweg dialed up back-to-back draw plays for Jackson. Baltimore wound up having to settle for a field goal. Snead seethed as he came off the field and had to be calmed down on the sideline.\n\nLater, with the Ravens near midfield and clinging to a 24-21 lead, Jackson ran around the left end on third-and-4 and gained three yards. Wide receiver Michael Crabtree walked off the field in visible disgust.\n\nHarbaugh said both receivers got \u201cin my face\u201d about the play-calling, but he chalked it up to passion and competitive fire, which he said he appreciated.\n\nSnead concurred. He meant no disrespect, he said, but wanted to do his part to help the team win. Having calmed down well after the game ended, he praised Jackson and the game plan. But he but did say that the Ravens have \"got to stay dangerous, for sure,\u201d meaning the team has to take more chances through the air. Harbaugh did promise an expansion of the play selection going forward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be some kind of a running football team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be a running football team, obviously; we always want to be a running football team \u2013 but we\u2019re a passing football team, too. I think you saw how well Lamar threw the ball. This kid can throw it. So, we\u2019ll be spreading the ball out to our receivers as well. We want to use all of our guys.\u201d\n\nNext time out, if given the chance, it\u2019s on the kid to show he is up to the task."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 10 Kentucky survives persistent VMI 92-82", "description": "Travis scores 22, Green adds 17 as No. 10 Kentucky holds off VMI 92-82", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/18/no-10-kentucky-survives-persistent-vmi-92-82/38560973/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b8048c1cae25cc89efcda65dc939f548db223efe/c=0-1007-2758-2558/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/usatsports/5d738c71aac34d9f94c32ab05de80502.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T01:30:21Z", "content": "Virginia Military's Bubba Parham, middle, is blocked by Kentucky's EJ Montgomery (23) as Immanuel Quickley defends during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in Lexington, Ky., Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 These early weeks haven't been easy for No. 10 Kentucky, but coach John Calipari sees an upside in how his team is working through growing pains to win.\n\nPerimeter defense will no doubt be a focal point for improvement after Bubba Parham nearly shot VMI past the Wildcats.\n\nQuade Green came off the bench to score a season-high 17 points, including five in the final 90 seconds, to help Kentucky hold off the Keydets 92-82 on Sunday night.\n\nStatistically, the Wildcats (3-1) appeared to do a lot right against VMI (3-2). They controlled the boards (43-22), the paint (42-14) and missed just 6 of 35 free throws, numbers that should've added up to a solid victory.\n\nInstead, they ended up being just enough to offset VMI and sophomore guard Bubba Parham. He scored a career-high 35 points and made 10 of the team's 19 3-pointers, the most ever against the Wildcats. Parham also created late-game anxiety for Kentucky.\n\nLeading by 19 midway through the second half, the Wildcats had to work to put away the stubborn Keydets, who made 12 second-half 3-pointers and got within 85-79 with 1:49 remaining.\n\n\"They made five, six, seven shots that you're like, 'dude, that's almost at half court,'\" Calipari said of VMI and Parham. \"But we had hands down, and we're talking at every huddle, you have to have your hands up on the guy. But hands were down and the kid was feeling it.\"\n\nGreen answered with a 3-pointer 19 seconds later and Ashton Hagans made a free throw for a 10-point edge.\n\nTyler Creammer responded with the Keydets' final 3 to get within 89-82 before Green made two free throws with 33 seconds left. PJ Washington (19 points, career-high 18 rebounds) made a free throw with 17 seconds left to seal Kentucky's third consecutive win.\n\n\"We've always got to find a way to win,\" Green said. \"They came out on fire tonight because we're Kentucky. However, we came back with some fire as well.\"\n\nReid Travis matched a season high with 22 points for the Wildcats, who won their second game of the Ohio Valley Hardwood Showcase. That total included 10 in the second half while playing with protective glasses after being poked in the eye in the first.\n\nParham finished 10 of 16 from long range to double his previous high of five 3s last December against Western Carolina. He also surpassed his previous scoring best of 26 points in January at Chattanooga. Garrett Gilkeson and Creammer each added 13 for the Keydets with three 3s.\n\n\"It helps that (Parham) kind of went crazy and made a bunch of shots,\" VMI coach Dan Earl said. \"I thought we really spread the ball and got some open shots in the second half.\"\n\nThe matchup was the first between the schools since the Keydets upset the Wildcats 111-103 in the 2008-09 season opener.\n\nTHE BUBBA SHOW\n\nParham seemingly couldn't miss from where he launched deep shots, to the point that even Kentucky players and fans reacted in amazement. Of the 10 he made, one from near the UK insignia at half court and a high, arcing attempt from the right corner seemed to stand out.\n\n\"I've been shooting like that for a while now,\" Parham said. \"Some people call it a rainbow shot, but I practice that each and every day, so it's my form now.\"\n\nParham scored the most points against Kentucky and in Rupp Arena since Texas A&M's Elston Turner dropped 40 on Jan. 12, 2013.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nKentucky should maintain its spot in the top 10 despite a win that was closer than expected.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nVMI: The Keydets entered the contest having made 25 of 51 3-pointers the past two outings and started hot with 6-of-9 shooting from long range. They couldn't match Kentucky in the paint or on the boards, and sure couldn't keep the Wildcats off the foul line. And yet, they were within seven in the final minute before missing the final three from behind the arc.\n\nKentucky: The Wildcats shot 49 percent and converted frequent chances at the line. They also dominated rebounding and paint and bench points, all of which were needed to offset the Keydets' perimeter game and Parham.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVMI hosts Kentucky Christian on Tuesday in the first meeting between the schools.\n\nKentucky hosts Winthrop on Wednesday in the first of two games sandwiched around Thanksgiving.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college basketball coverage: http://collegebasketball.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Nick Ward's status was uncertain for Michigan State heading into Sunday's game against Tennessee Tech.\n\nHis play was anything but.\n\nThe junior forward scored 23 points, including the first eight points for the No. 11 Spartans, in a 101-33 victory, tying the largest margin of victory in program history.\n\n\"I was just working as hard as I can,\" Ward said. \"I just ran my lanes, posted deep. I just did what I could for my team to win.\"\n\nCassius Winston added 19 points for Michigan State (3-1), which equaled the margin of a 121-53 victory against Morehead State on Dec. 1, 1992, when Shawn Respert scored 32 points to lead the way.\n\nSunday it was Ward, who went to work right away, scoring with power moves in the post, finishing 10-for-12 from the field and grabbing six rebounds four nights after pounding the floor in pain several times after a fall.\n\n\"In practices, all spring, summer and fall, Nick has been better,\" Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. \"I think when you've never really been injured, you get scared.\n\n\"He is improving the right-hand jump hooks, he's not getting as frustrated with the double teams.\"\n\nWard missed the final 32 minutes Wednesday against Louisiana-Monroe with a right ankle sprain. He said the ankle was sore on Thursday and Izzo held him out of practice, but he returned to practice Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"I didn't want to sit out,\" Ward said.\n\nTennessee Tech (0-5) closed the deficit to 23-14 with a Corey Tillery 3-pointer with 7:42 left in the first half until a Spartans' explosion.\n\nA 19-0 Michigan State run closed the first half and an 11-0 run opened the second for a 53-14 lead.\n\n\"There were minutes in the first half where I thought our defense really improved, it looked OK,\" Tennessee Tech coach Steve Payne said. \"You keep playing these dudes, they'll put it on your head. At some point, they're going to get you. They got us pretty good.\"\n\nMicaiah Henry and Garrett Golday had six points apiece to lead Tennessee Tech.\n\nJoshua Langford added 16 points for Michigan State.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nTennessee Tech: Games against Memphis, No. 7 North Carolina and No. 11 Michigan State have the Golden Eagles more than ready for Ohio Valley Conference competition. It gets much easier from here.\n\nMichigan State: The Spartans licked their wounds after the opener against Kansas with three straight wins. Next, tougher tests await in Las Vegas.\n\nGETTING THERE\n\nThe Spartans had their third straight rough 3-point shooting half early Sunday, but responded after halftime.\n\nMichigan State shot 9-for-13 (69.2 percent) from deep in the second half to finish 14 for 33 (42.4 percent) for the game.\n\nThe Spartans were 6-for-29 on 3-pointers (20.7 percent) against Louisiana-Monroe on Wednesday and 5 for 20 (25.0 percent) in Sunday's first half.\n\n\"The only negative to me was the number of wide-open threes we missed in the first half,\" Izzo said. \"I told the guys I thought we were shooting them 3 or 4 feet behind the 3-point line. Then we started getting up to that line and getting a few inside-out passes, I thought we knocked down some big three in the second half.\"\n\nBARRY GOOD TRIES\n\nTennessee Tech's Courtney Alexander II attempts his free throws underhanded like Hall of Famer Rick Barry. Alexander was 1-for-4 on Sunday and is now shooting 7-for-25 on the season (28 percent).\n\nHe changed his routine before last season and improved to 51.6 percent after hitting just 34.5 percent in his first two seasons.\n\nAlexander's father is Courtney Alexander Sr., who played three seasons in the NBA after being drafted No. 13 by Orlando out of Fresno State.\n\nBIG SHOTS\n\nMichigan State's Jack Hoiberg, son of Chicago Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg, scored his first two career points to close the scoring.\n\nWearing goggles, the walk-on redshirt freshman splashed a pair of free throws as Michigan State's student section, the \"Izzone,\" went nuts.\n\nIt was an exciting feeling, an exciting opportunity,\" Hoiberg said, adding that his dad texted congratulations after the game. \"I was just trying to make a couple free throws, that's all I was trying to do, but it worked out in a good way.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTennessee Tech: After three road losses, it's back to Cookeville where the Golden Eagles will play Louisiana-Monroe on Friday.\n\nMichigan State: The Spartans play No. 20 UCLA on Thursday in the Las Vegas Invitational opener.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Martin Truex Jr. badly wanted to end Furniture Row's existence with a second straight championship. He came up one spot short in NASCAR's season finale to spoil the farewell.\n\nTruex was in prime position to repeat his Cup Series title at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Sunday until a late caution ruined the night and left Truex wondering what might have been.\n\nHis planned goodbye bash turned into a pity party.\n\n\"No question we had the car to beat,\" Truex said. \"But if you don't lead the last lap, it doesn't matter what you got. We fought hard. We played the right strategy. We were off a little in the daytime, just like last year. We kept getting it better and better and better. On the long run, man, the thing was nasty. We killed them. That was cool, but it didn't come down to that tonight.\"\n\nTruex took the lead by passing fellow contender Kyle Busch on a restart after a final round of pit stops. He thought he had the fastest car and would drive away in his Toyota, but Joey Logano passed him three laps later and pulled away for the victory.\n\nIt was Logano who moved Truex out of his way in the final turn at Martinsville Speedway last month to earn his spot in the final four. Truex jeered Logano after the aggressive pass at Martinsville and promised to prevent Logano from winning the title.\n\nTruex could have retaliated and wrecked Logano as Logano made the winning pass Sunday, but Truex instead took the high road.\n\n\"He was so much faster than me at that point,\" Truex said. \"If I would have hit him, he would have just hit me back and went on. It was moot point. I needed to be faster. It wasn't even close at that point in the race. Hell, he passed me so fast I didn't even have a chance to do anything.\"\n\nSo he drove the final laps watching Logano pull away.\n\nTruex felt even more disappointment when he returned to the pits and his Furniture Row Racing crew.\n\nThe one-car team based in Denver \u2014 far removed from NASCAR's North Carolina roots \u2014 is closing its doors after a 14-year run in which it morphed from an underfunded also-ran to a NASCAR champion last season with Truex behind the wheel.\n\nFRR employees, including crew chief Cole Pearn, choked back tears at the shop this week when the No. 78 Toyota was loaded into the hauler for the finale. They hugged, snapped group photos and filmed the hauler as it started the 2,100-mile ride to Homestead.\n\nTruex wanted to deliver the ultimate parting gift with a second series championship in as many years.\n\n\"It sucks,\" he said. \"Yeah, it sucks. It sucks. It hurts. It's terrible. I hate it. I wish we could go on and race 10 more years together, but we can't.\"\n\nTruex and FRR accomplished what no other single-car team has done in the current championship format. They went head-to-head and beat the heavyweight teams owned by Rick Hendrick, Roger Penske and Tony Stewart. They forged a hasty relationship born out of necessity, and it soon turned into a fruitful partnership both sides wanted to continue while chasing championships well into the future.\n\nBut once 5-hour Energy, which plans to leave NASCAR at the end of the season, pulled its funding and no other sponsorship could be secured, owner Barney Visser pulled the plug on the organization.\n\n\"To go from a two-race winner to a 19-race winner, a championship, fourth in points, a second in points, it's just been amazing,\" Truex said later. \"Everything about it has been great. Everything about it has been the best thing I've ever been a part of. You know, I feel good about my future and going to a great place, and I know we'll have more success. But it's going to be different. It's going to be a different team, a different cast of characters. These guys were a special group, and I'm very thankful to get to work with all of them.\"\n\nTruex, Pearn and a few crew guys will stay together as they move to Joe Gibbs Racing next season. But what they accomplished in 2017 \u2014 and how close they came to another one in 2018 \u2014 will stick with them forever.\n\n\"Just proud of the effort,\" Pearn said. \"To go out that way and have a car capable of winning the championship and be that close is something you've got to be proud of. That's racing. That's this format. It's a matter of how it shakes for you. Last year, it shook out for us and this year it didn't. Still, we did a great job.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick combined to win 16 races, lead 3,459 laps and each were considered a heavy favorite to win a second NASCAR championship.\n\nThey let the race they needed slip away, and champion Joey Logano pounced.\n\nBusch, Harvick and Martin Truex Jr. comprised NASCAR's \"Big Three\" this season, but it was a Big 0 for the trio in the Cup finale Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Harvick, dominant in the No. 4 Ford all year, lagged on the speed charts all weekend. The Joe Gibbs Racing' pit crew flubbed two stops for Busch \u2014 the blunders cost him six and four spots off pit road \u2014 that denied one of NASCAR's biggest career winners a second title.\n\n\"We were so bad tonight on the racetrack and on pit road that nothing was kind of going our way,\" Busch said. \"It was just not all there the way that we needed it to.\"\n\nBusch's stops for the No. 18 Toyota were the pits.\n\nAt the end of the first stage, lug nuts were not properly secured to the right front tire that slowed the stop and cost Busch key track position. On a stop later in the race, the air hose got stuck under the front of the car as the pit crew worked on the left side.\n\nFront tire changer Cam Waugh \u2014 wearing a firesuit as green as the M&M'S paint scheme \u2014 played a pivotal role in both mistakes. With his firesuit stripped to his waist, Waugh trudged through the garage and apologized to a JGR official back at the hauler. Waugh tossed his gear into a locker and angrily shouted \"No!\" when asked for comment on the over-the-wall crew's performance.\n\nGibbs, the Super Bowl and NASCAR champion, was diplomatic about the errors.\n\n\"We were just off today. Tough day for us,\" Gibbs said. \"I don't think you ever really know why. I think you've got to study all that. It was kind of small things here that slowed us down. But when we had to have a great pit stop, we had a great pit stop.\"\n\nBusch's crew did atone late in the race with a flawless stop in the No. 1 pit stall gifted to him when teammate and pole winner Denny Hamlin surrendered the spot.\n\nBy then, it was too late, and Busch had nothing left on a late restart. The botched pit stops compounded the team's lack of speed.\n\n\"You can always have stops where things don't go your way,\" Gibbs said. \"That's part of life. Those guys turned around and had the stop of the night to give us a chance to maybe win a race. That's just their world.\"\n\nBusch, who had career highs in top-fives (22) and top-10s (28), won the race en route to the title in 2015 and finished fourth Sunday.\n\nHarvick, who tied Busch with a series-high eight wins, finished third behind Logano and Truex. Harvick was nailed with a cheating violation in a win at Texas that cost him his automatic berth into the championship race. Harvick made the final round with a stout effort last week at Phoenix and seemed poised to win a title to pair with his 2014 championship. He led 58 laps early in the race \u2014 with interim crew chief Tony Gibson calling the shots for suspended crew chief Rodney Childers \u2014 but soon saw the sun set on his championship push.\n\n\"When it got dark, we just lost the rear grip and couldn't get off the corner and was having trouble turning in the corner,\" Harvick said. \"We just never could get the rear grip back to where we needed to, and I couldn't take off.\"\n\nLogano did, zipping past Truex late to win his first Cup championship in a season where he was the outlier of the \"Big Three.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Karl B DeBlaker) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Carolina captain Justin Williams made sure the Hurricanes rebounded from a \"dud\" of a loss.\n\nWilliams and Micheal Ferland scored in the game's first 30 seconds and the Carolina Hurricanes held on for a 2-1 victory over the New Jersey Devils on Sunday.\n\n\"Listen, winning is a lot more fun, isn't it?\" Williams said. \"A better attitude, a lot more fun around the dressing room.\"\n\nThe Hurricanes lost 4-1 at home on Saturday night to the Columbus Blue Jackets. Williams didn't mince words after that loss, the team's seventh in nine games.\n\n\"It was a dud,\" Williams said on Saturday. \"Just call it what it was. A dud. And certainly unacceptable.\"\n\nJordan Staal sprung Williams, who cut between Travis Zajac and Taylor Hall to give Carolina a 1-0 lead just 22 seconds in.\n\nEight seconds later, New Jersey defenseman Damon Severson turned the puck over in the neutral zone and Teuvo Teravainen fed Ferland, who sent a one-timer past New Jersey goalie Cory Schneider (20 saves) for a 2-0 lead.\n\nCarolina's two-goal outburst in the first half-minute is the fastest in franchise history and tied for fifth-fastest in NHL history.\n\n\"It never hurts in the NHL to come up with two goals early and make them chase us,\" Staal said.\n\nGoalie Curtis McElhinney made it stand up, finishing with 33 saves for Carolina, which improved to 2-1-1 after four games of a six-game homestand.\n\nThe Devils, who lost in overtime at home on Saturday to the Detroit Red Wings, cut the deficit in half when Pavel Zacha flipped a backhander past McElhinney at 6:33 in the first.\n\nBut New Jersey was 0 for 5 on the power play, including three empty chances in the second period.\n\n\"I thought after the first 30 seconds, we gathered ourselves and played well,\" New Jersey coach John Hynes said. \"Unfortunately, we couldn't find a way to put the puck in the net.\"\n\nNew Jersey had a 34 to 25 edge in shots, but could only get one shot by McElhinney. Will Butcher had two great chances to tie the game at 2, one in the second period and another in the final minute of the game, but McElhinney was up to the task.\n\n\"We had a couple of nice saves when we needed them,\" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said.\n\nWilliams, who scored for the first time since Oct. 13, was happy with how the team responded after Saturday's loss.\n\n\"You always want to atone for an average game, actually well below-average,\" Williams said. \"I didn't play great last game and you always want to get back at it. The good news for me was there was another game in less than 24 hours.\"\n\nBrind'Amour was happy to get a win, only the third in regulation in 11 home games, and how the veteran leaders stepped up.\n\n\"I thought our best players were our veteran guys,\" Brind'Amour said. \"We needed a win and they got us one.\"\n\nBut the first-year coach wasn't pleased with the turnovers or how many chances his team created after the explosive first minute.\n\n\"There's a lot to still get better at,\" Brind'Amour said. \"At the end of the day, we got the win and it was an ugly win and you have to have those.\"\n\nNOTES: Devils center Nico Hischier was out for the fourth straight game with an upper-body injury. ... Ferland's goal in the first period was his team-leading 10th of the season and third in four games for Carolina. ... Schneider, who missed the first eight games with a hip injury, is winless in four starts this season. . The Hurricanes have only been outshot twice this season (at Chicago on Nov. 8) but they are 2-0 in those games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDevils: Host the Montreal Canadiens on Wednesday.\n\nHurricanes: Host the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I can\u2019t really change my schedule at all. It\u2019s a lot, but I gotta keep working \u2026 Me and Denise had a couple arguments.

She has to understand that.\u201d\n\nIn a conversation with her sister, Denise said that Lonzo would only visit Zoey on Saturdays before leaving the following day. Last month, she called out Lonzo in a series of Instagram posts and stories.\n\nDenise said:\n\n\u201cThings have been tough as far as getting help from Zo because I get absolutely no help from him.\u201d\n\nShe continued:\n\n\u201cI understand that his basketball career comes first, but our lives have changed dramatically. I knew it was going to change, but I didn\u2019t know it would be this much of a change.\u201d\n\nLonzo eventually conceded that his dedication to the Lakers would prevent him from giving Denise the life that she wanted.\n\n\u201cDenise wants to live the fairytale life right now. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really give that to her because I\u2019m not there all the time. I just don\u2019t know what else I can do. I don\u2019t blame her for the way she feels and wanting me to do more, but right now, I gotta be focused on my profession. Not only for myself but for my family. A lot is on my shoulders to make sure I take care of business.\u201d\n\nWhile the two did not explicitly say that their relationship, which dates back to their high school days, had ended, Denise said that she just considered Lonzo \u201cZoey\u2019s dad.\u201d When asked about the state of their relationship, she said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just parents, I guess. He\u2019s Zoey\u2019s dad \u2026 I just want us both to be happy. Whatever that means, so if it\u2019s us together then fine.

(Photo: Tim Heitman, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe 2018 Holidays are upon us, which is another way of saying it's time to start closely dissecting NFL playoff scenarios.\n\nHere's how the playoff picture looks after Week 12's Thanksgiving games:\n\nNFC\n\n1. New Orleans Saints (10-1): NFC South leader. They reclaim the top spot after beating Atlanta due to their head-to-head win against the Rams. Three of New Orleans' final five games are against divisional foes, including two meetings with fellow playoff contender Carolina.\n\n2. Los Angeles Rams (10-1): NFC West leader. They lose ground while on their bye week but remain in good position to claim a first-round bye. The Rams should have an easier finishing schedule than New Orleans.\n\n3. Chicago Bears (8-3): NFC North leader. Survived a tough scrap in Detroit without injured QB Mitchell Trubisky to cement division lead.\n\n4. Dallas Cowboys (6-5): NFC East leader. They take over first place from the Redskins by virtue of a superior division record. Washington could be back in wild-card position by the end of the weekend with some help.\n\n5. Carolina Panthers (6-4): Wild card No. 1. After consecutive losses, objects in rear-view mirror (Redskins, Seahawks) are suddenly closer than they once appeared.\n\n6. Minnesota Vikings (5-4-1): Wild card No. 2. Need to beat Green Bay in order to hold off Washington.\n\nIn the hunt: Washington Redskins (6-5), Seattle Seahawks (5-5), Green Bay Packers (4-5-1), Philadelphia Eagles (4-6)\n\nAFC\n\n1. Kansas City Chiefs (9-2): AFC West leader. They still have have inside track to home-field advantage, though the Chargers are still lurking while the Patriots own the head-to-head tiebreaker should it come into play.\n\n2. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-2-1): AFC North leader. It wasn't pretty, but their sixth consecutive victory put them 2\u00bd games ahead of the competition in their division and a half-game ahead of New England in the race for the conference's second bye.\n\n3. New England Patriots (7-3): AFC East leader. Not a fun bye week following that embarrassing loss in Nashville. But little reason to believe Pats won't earn a 10th consecutive division crown and 16th in 17 seasons when Tom Brady was the predominant starter under center.\n\n4. Houston Texans (7-3): AFC South leader. A remarkable turnaround continues with a seventh consecutive victory stacked for a club that started 0-3. A Week 1 loss to the Patriots drops Houston here.\n\n5. Los Angeles Chargers (7-3): Wild card No. 1. A six-game win streak went up in smoke after they were upset at home by Denver. But the Bolts are still a solid bet to make the playoffs, even if their hopes of overtaking the Chiefs in the AFC West just took a broadside.\n\n6. Baltimore Ravens (5-5): Wild card No. 2. \"If the season ended today\" \u2014 such infamous, superfluous words for this kind of drill ... since the season ... has a long way to go. But, for now, Baltimore would get the spot given its superior record (5-3) in conference games over Miami and Indianapolis, the highest-ranked clubs from the other divisions. (A preliminary tiebreaker to rank teams within divisions eliminates the Bengals and Titans ... for now.)\n\nIn the hunt: Cincinnati Bengals (5-5), Indianapolis Colts (5-5), Miami Dolphins (5-5), Tennessee Titans (5-5), Denver Broncos (4-6)\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Brees, Saints singe sinking Eagles, 48-7", "description": "Drew Brees passed for 363 yards and four touchdowns and the Saints won their ninth straight with a 48-7 demolition of the Philadelphia Eagles", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/18/brees-saints-singe-sinking-eagles-48-7/38560715/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7d3d39961c9d640dbc19137019be791ba925fbfa/c=0-1245-4109-3556/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/usatsports/0152a4add95349d6999184be3a5b5c8b.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T00:48:57Z", "content": "New Orleans Saints running back Mark Ingram (22) carries for a touchdown in the first half of an NFL football game against the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018.

(AP Photo/Bill Feig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Drew Brees grinned, paused as if searching for the right words, and even let out the beginnings of a laugh.\n\nThe Saints have made 40-point outings look routine lately, and the record-setting quarterback is trying to enjoy it without showing a hint of complacency.\n\n\"It's a lot of points, but we have a high standard for ourselves,\" Brees said. \"You're still not satisfied because you know you could have done a little bit better \u2014 but the end result is good.\"\n\nBrees passed for 363 yards and four touchdowns, and the Saints won their ninth straight with a 48-7 demolition of Philadelphia on Sunday that marked the Eagles' worst loss by far since they won last season's Super Bowl.\n\nIn fact, it was the worst loss by a reigning Super Bowl champion.\n\n\"I haven't gotten my (butt) kicked like that in a long time,\" Eagles defensive end Chris Long said.\n\nBrees completed 22 of 30 passes and did not turn over the ball, giving him 25 TD passes and only one interception this season. Brees' fourth touchdown seemed to encapsulate New Orleans' audacious approach to the game. He hit running back Alvin Kamara in stride down the right sideline for a 37 yards on a fourth-and-7 play that gave the Saints (9-1) a 45-7 lead early in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"It's hard to stop us,\" Kamara said.\n\nReceiver Michael Thomas said the Eagles were \"just in the way, next team up. We just had to do what we had to do, regardless.\"\n\nBrees' other touchdown passes went for 3 yards to Austin Carr, 15 yards to rookie Tre'Quan Smith and 23 yards to Thomas. Smith finished with 10 catches for 157 yards, while Thomas' four catches for 92 yards made him the first receiver in Saints history to surpass 1,000 yards receiving in each of his first three seasons.\n\nMark Ingram rushed 16 times for 103 yards, including touchdowns of 14 yards and 1 yard. Kamara added 71 yards to help New Orleans finish with 546 total yards and score at least 40 for the sixth time this season.\n\nMeanwhile, New Orleans' defense produced a second straight dominant showing after largely stifling Cincinnati the previous week.\n\nThe Saints now have outscored their past two opponents 99-21 combined, is not easy to do in a league known for competitive balance.\n\n\"It blows my mind, too, trust me,\" said Saints defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins, who had one of three sacks on Carson Wentz. \"That just speaks volumes not only to the type of talent we have on this team but how locked in everybody is. I think everybody knows how special we can be and everyone knows the end goal. If everybody here isn't thinking Super Bowl then they're in the wrong locker room.\"\n\nDESCENDING EAGLES\n\nWentz was intercepted three times \u2014 once by Marshon Lattimore and twice by Chris Banjo \u2014 and finished with 156 yards on 19-of-33 passing.\n\nTime will tell if the lopsided loss marked the beginning of the end of the Eagles' title defense. Philadelphia (4-6) remained two games behind Washington (6-4) for first place in the NFC East, but more injuries befell its already depleted lineup. The Eagles offered virtually no resistance to New Orleans and looked thoroughly outclassed by the surging Saints.\n\nRookie running back Josh Adams rushed for a 28-yard TD that pulled the Eagles within 17-7 in the second quarter, but the Saints responded with a Smith's TD on which the receiver held onto a hard throw over the middle while being sandwiched by two defenders. That made it 24-7 at halftime and the game was not competitive after that.\n\n\"The product we're putting out there is not up to our standards,\" Wentz said. \"I'm not playing up to my standards, but we know the talent we have.\"\n\nANOTHER RECORD\n\nTwice this season, Brees has thrown for four TDs in a game without an interception, giving him an NFL-record 23 such performances in his career. His latest put him one ahead of New England's Tom Brady.\n\nINJURIES\n\nEagles: Center Jason Kelce hurt his left elbow in the first quarter and was replaced by Stefen Wisniewski. Safety Avonte Maddox left with a knee injury on New Orleans' second possession. Defensive back Rasul Douglas had to be helped off the field with a left leg injury in the third quarter. Long snapper Rick Lovato was taken from the game to be evaluated for a concussion.\n\nSaints: Right guard Larry Warford left to be evaluated for a concussion in the third quarter and was replaced by Cameron Tom.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nEagles: Host the New York Giants on Sunday.\n\nSaints: Host Atlanta on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Yet, in the months since the second-year pro became a father, rumors had circulated about their relationship and Lonzo\u2019s presence as a parent.\n\nThe latest episode of Ball in the Family offered the most detailed glimpse to date of Lonzo\u2019s struggles with parenthood, and it certainly has affected his relationship with Garcia.\n\nLonzo explained early in the episode, saying that his preparation for the season took away from his ability to be available for Denise and their daughter:\n\n\u201cShe gets kind of mad when I\u2019m not there \u2026 It is what it is. I can\u2019t really change my schedule at all. It\u2019s a lot, but I gotta keep working \u2026 Me and Denise had a couple arguments. I know it\u2019s tough on her that she has to do a lot of stuff right now by herself because I\u2019m not there. She wants me to be there, but it\u2019s pretty tough right now. She has to understand that.\u201d\n\nIn a conversation with her sister, Denise said that Lonzo would only visit Zoey on Saturdays before leaving the following day. Last month, she called out Lonzo in a series of Instagram posts and stories.\n\nDenise said:\n\n\u201cThings have been tough as far as getting help from Zo because I get absolutely no help from him.\u201d\n\nShe continued:\n\n\u201cI understand that his basketball career comes first, but our lives have changed dramatically. I knew it was going to change, but I didn\u2019t know it would be this much of a change.\u201d\n\nLonzo eventually conceded that his dedication to the Lakers would prevent him from giving Denise the life that she wanted.\n\n\u201cDenise wants to live the fairytale life right now. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really give that to her because I\u2019m not there all the time. I just don\u2019t know what else I can do. I don\u2019t blame her for the way she feels and wanting me to do more, but right now, I gotta be focused on my profession. Not only for myself but for my family. A lot is on my shoulders to make sure I take care of business.\u201d\n\nWhile the two did not explicitly say that their relationship, which dates back to their high school days, had ended, Denise said that she just considered Lonzo \u201cZoey\u2019s dad.\u201d When asked about the state of their relationship, she said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just parents, I guess. He\u2019s Zoey\u2019s dad \u2026 I just want us both to be happy. Whatever that means, so if it\u2019s us together then fine. But if it\u2019s not, then it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the full episode here."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "The Latest: Missouri advances to Paradise Jam title game", "description": "Jordan Geist scored 18 of his season-high 21 points in the second half, and Missouri used a late run to pull away from Oregon State 69-63 in the semifinals of the Paradise Jam tournament", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/18/the-latest-missouri-advances-to-paradise-jam-title-game/38560669/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T00:41:44Z", "content": "ST.

Both the Gamecocks and the Terrapins have bragged they have signed the top 2019 recruiting class. Maryland signed four players in the ESPN top 50, while South Carolina two signees are in the network's top 13.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMaryland: This was the kind of win against an elite non-conference team that Maryland hasn't picked up too much in recent seasons. Maryland showed resilience, roaring back after an awful start. But South Carolina's pressure caused the Terps guards fits. Lewis came into the third quarter with three turnovers all season. She lost the ball five times in the third quarter Sunday.\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks expected growing pains after A'ja Wilson left and was the first pick in the WNBA Draft. South Carolina coach Dawn Staley wants a faster, more outside oriented team. But they have to shoot better than 4.8 percent on 3-pointers to beat anyone.\n\nSUPER FRESHMAN\n\nMaryland's Shakira Austin scored 10 points and had 16 rebounds, nine of them on the offensive glass.

It's timing the shot, knowing the angle of which side the ball is coming on,\" Austin said. \"I was able to get through a lot of box outs today.\"\n\nJENNINGS JOURNEY\n\nStaley is still being careful with senior Alexis Jennings' knee. The coach is only playing the Kentucky transfer in spurts. Maryland's bug run started when she left after starting the game. She played 15 minutes, just one of them in the second half, but still had nine points and four rebounds.\n\n\"I wish she could have played more. But we've got a long season. This is real early. We need her healthy for later on in the season more than these first few games,\" junior guard Te'a Cooper said\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nSouth Carolina's loss means the Gamecocks streak of 89 straight weeks in the AP Top 10 will likely be snapped Monday. But South Carolina should stay in the poll for the 114th straight week \u2014 the fifth longest run in the country, just behind what will be Maryland's 156th straight Top 25 appearance.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMaryland: The Terrapins head off the mainland to take on Morgan State on Friday and No. 14 Georgia on Saturday in the Puerto Rico Clasico.\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks open the Vancouver Showcase with East Tennessee State on Thursday. They will play three games in three nights, with possible matchups looming against No. 8 Oregon State and No. 1 Notre Dame.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But when it comes down to that last play, and you're on the losing side of it, those hurt, especially in a situation where we're a desperate team in need of a win.\"\n\nFor a team that was 12 minutes away from the Super Bowl last year, just getting to the postseason appears unlikely. The Jaguars, whose 3-1 start included a big win early over New England, fell to 3-7 and are four games behind the AFC South-leading Houston Texans.\n\nRoethlisberger, at one point 3 of 12 for 18 yards and two interceptions, was at his best in the end. He finished 27 of 47 for 314 yards and two touchdowns, with 170 of those yards coming in the fourth quarter.\n\nHe had plenty of help from the Steelers' defense, which figured out to stop Leonard Fournette and came up with key sacks of Blake Bortles.\n\nThe Jaguars ran 11 players in the fourth quarter and, including three sacks, had minus-7 yards.\n\nCornerback Jalen Ramsey, who last week showed some frustration with a tweet suggesting that he'll be missed when he's gone, came up with two interceptions by breaking on Antonio Brown. On one, he managed to keep the ball from hitting the turf. On another, when it appeared Roethlisberger had Brown for a touchdown, Ramsey reached over his helmet and somehow kept control of the ball.\n\nAfter the game, he was more angry than shocked.\n\n\"I've been pretty (ticked) off, I'm not going to lie to you,\" Ramsey said. \"I've been battling with my emotions, trying to hold them in. ... You need a little frustration. If people are in here and they're content \u2014 not saying anybody is \u2014 but if people are content with losing and things not going right, then that's not the type of guys you want on the team and that's not the type of environment you want to have.\"\n\nEven when the game was going well for the Jaguars, they left points out there.\n\nThey scored on three straight possessions \u2014 all field goals by Josh Lambo.\n\nOn the first scoring drive, the Jaguars had 13 rushing plays \u2014 just one pass, a short completion \u2014 for 65 yards and stalled on a holding penalty. Another drive that started on the Pittsburgh 47 ended with a sack on Bortles.\n\nFournette was clearly at full strength from a hamstring injury, with 28 carries for 95 yards. He equally effective out of the backfield for two completions of 20 or more yards, leading to the only touchdown.\n\nAgainst the Steelers \u2014 and given how the Jaguars' season has gone \u2014 that wasn't enough.\n\nNext up is a trip to Buffalo.\n\n\"We just have to look forward to next week and try to get back in the win column,\" Campbell said. \"There's still a lot of life left. I don't know if 9-7 will get us where we want to go. We might need some help. Nobody's quitting. If we can go and play our best ball and find a way to a 9-7 record, hopefully that will be enough to get in.\n\n\"It's hard to win six in a row in this league, but it's possible,\" he said. \"It just starts with one.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Denver had lost six of their last seven going into Sunday's game against Los Angeles, but Chargers coach Anthony Lynn kept warning everyone that the Broncos were dangerous because they had been in most of their games until the final minute.\n\nLynn's words became prophetic as Brandon McManus kicked a last-second 34-yard field goal to give the Broncos a 23-22 win and snap the Chargers' six-game winning streak.\n\n\"We've been in four or five of these games and didn't make enough plays to win. Today we didn't hope to win, we made plays to win,\" Denver coach Vance Joseph said.\n\nDenver got the ball at its own 8 with 1:51 remaining, and Case Keenum orchestrated a seven-play, 76-yard drive. Keenum, who was 19 of 32 for 205 yards, completed five passes for 86 yards during the drive, including a 30-yarder to Courtland Sutton to the Denver 16. Keenum then spiked the ball and McManus' kick split the uprights.\n\nIt was McManus' second game-winning field goal this season and the fifth of his career. It also helped erase memories of two weeks ago, when his 51-yard attempt went wide right as time expired in a 19-17 loss to Houston.\n\n\"I think we've had three or four close ones that have come down to it and Brandon has made those kicks and we trust him,\" Keenum said. \"It feels good. A lot better than the alternative.\"\n\nWide receiver Keenan Allen, who had nine receptions for 89 yards and a TD, succinctly summed up why the Chargers (7-3) lost when he said, \"Penalties. Turnovers. Not making plays at the end of the game.\"\n\nPhilip Rivers, who threw for 401 yards, had two interceptions and Los Angeles committed 14 penalties, including 10 in the first half. Mike Badgley, who made three field goals, also missed an extra point that ended up looming large.\n\n\"Those are things we've stayed away from \u2014 penalties and turnovers \u2014 but they showed up today. For whatever reason, I don't know. We'll figure it out, though,\" coach Anthony Lynn said.\n\nDenver's talented rookie offensive trio of Phillip Lindsay, Royce Freeman and Sutton had big games.\n\nLindsay had 11 carries for 79 yards with two touchdowns. His 41-yard TD run early in the second quarter, which put Denver up 7-6, was set up the play before when the Broncos successfully executed a fake punt with punter Colby Waldman throwing a 12-yard pass to fullback Andy Janovich for a first down. It was the second straight week the Chargers allowed a fake punt.\n\nThe undrafted rookie also had a 2-yard TD on a direct snap early in the fourth quarter to give Denver a 20-19 lead.\n\n\"We knew that going in that they were physical and athletic, but for us, we just went out there and knew we needed to be physical, too,\" Lindsay said. \"We knew that we were going to have run the ball in order for us to win this game.\"\n\nFreeman, who missed two games with an ankle injury, had seven carries for 23 yards, including a 3-yard touchdown to bring the Broncos within 19-14.\n\nThree plays earlier, Von Miller swung momentum back in Denver's favor when he picked off Rivers on a screen pass and returned it 40 yards to the Chargers' 18. It was Miller's first interception in a regular-season game since 2012.\n\n\"The interception turned the game around, to me. That spun the whole game,\" Rivers said. \"It was about to be a blowout, and he made that play, and then it's a touchdown and then all of a sudden he made it a game.\"\n\nSutton tied a career high with 78 yards on three catches.\n\nRivers, who had his 11th 400-yard passing game, completed 28 of 43, but it was the seventh time the Chargers have lost when he has passed for over 400.\n\nThe 15-year veteran became the sixth quarterback in league history to throw at least two touchdown passes in each of his team's first 10 games to start a season. He eluded the blitz and threw a 4-yard pass to a wide-open Allen late in the second quarter to put Los Angeles on top 13-6. He then threw a 6-yard TD to Antonio Gates on the opening possession of the second half.\n\nMelvin Gordon had 158 yards from scrimmage (89 rushing, 69 receiving), marking the sixth straight game he has had 130 yards or more.\n\nMOMENTOUS SACK\n\nMiller's sack of Rivers in the second quarter gave him 10 for the season, which allowed him to join Reggie White and DeMarcus Ware as the only players with 10 or more sacks in seven of their first eight seasons. He is also the fifth-fastest player to reach 100 career sacks among players who began their careers in 1982 or later.\n\nBOSA RETURNS\n\nChargers defensive end Joey Bosa made his season debut after missing the first nine games with a bone bruise to his left foot. The third-year lineman did not start but was in on pass-rushing situations.\n\nINJURIES\n\nChargers defensive tackle Corey Liuget was carted to the locker room with a knee injury during the second quarter. Lynn said it appears as if the eighth-year lineman might be out for the rest of the season, but the team will know more on Monday.\n\nDenver wide receiver DeSean Hamilton suffered a knee injury in the second quarter, and cornerback Bradley Roby was evaluated for a concussion in the fourth quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBroncos: Host the Pittsburgh Steelers next Sunday.\n\nChargers: Host the Arizona Cardinals next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Raiders won 23-21. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 The hollering in the post-game locker room sounded as if Oakland had just won a playoff game or something.\n\nThat's how good victory finally felt for the Raiders.\n\nDaniel Carlson kicked a 35-yard field goal as the game ended to give Oakland a 23-21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday in a matchup of teams scraping the bottom of the NFL standings.\n\nThe Raiders (2-8), who had lost five straight, matched the record of the Cardinals.\n\n\"It's fun to win again,\" said Jon Gruden, whose return to coaching this season after a decade away has been difficult, to say the least. \"With the injuries and the lack of practice, I really credit our guys for finishing the football game and finding a way to win.\"\n\nDerek Carr threw for two touchdowns and had completions of 32 and 20 yards on the final drive that led to Carlson's winning kick.\n\n\"I was just ready,\" Carlson said. \"I stayed ready those last two drives because I didn't know when it was going to happen. I had a feeling it was going to happen eventually. ... It's awesome.\"\n\nCarlson also had field goals of 49 and 21 yards in the second half after the teams were tied 14-14 at the break.\n\n\"We all believed. There was never a doubt,\" Carr said. \"There's been times when we believed and we didn't win. It was the same feeling you need to have, same mentality, same look in everybody's eye. It was a good win.\"\n\nArizona rookie Josh Rosen threw for three touchdowns, two to Larry Fitzgerald, but was intercepted twice. Both picks led to first-half touchdowns for Oakland. David Johnson rushed for a season-best 137 yards, including a 53-yarder that set up Rosen's 5-yard TD pass to Fitzgerald that gave the Cardinals a 21-20 lead with 5:02 to play.\n\nLater, Johnson had a 57-yard touchdown run called back by a holding penalty against Ricky Seals-Jones and also had a key drop. That possession also featured an unnecessary roughness penalty on tight end Jermaine Gresham that helped force the punt to Oakland.\n\n\"It was just a dumb play by me,\" Gresham said. \"I turned around and saw my guy (Fitzgerald) on the ground. It was a stupid thing. ... I cost us the game.\"\n\nCarr completed 19 of 31 passes for 192 yards.\n\nRosen was 9 of 20 for 136 yards, but three of the completions went for scores: 18 and 5 yards to Fitzgerald and a 59-yard pass play to fellow rookie Christian Kirk. Fitzgerald has 114 career TD catches, seventh most in NFL history.\n\n\"This one is going to definitely sting,\" Johnson said. \"You know, the Raiders, everyone knows they're trading guys away, they're doing everything to try to rebuild. This one is a tough one.\"\n\nOr, as Rosen put it, \"No disrespect to the Raiders but we feel we are the better football team. That's what makes this so frustrating.\"\n\nThe day started badly for the Cardinals and ended that way.\n\nOn Arizona's second play, Gareon Conley made a diving interception and returned it 28 yards to the Cardinals 33-yard line. Three plays later, Carr threw to wide-open Jared Cook for the touchdown.\n\nArizona took the subsequent kickoff and tied it with a nine-play, 64-yard drive. Rosen threw 18 yards to Fitzgerald for the touchdown.\n\nThe Cardinals took the lead when Rosen, changing the play at the line of scrimmage, threw short to Kirk. Kirk, on his 22nd birthday, shook loose from a would-be tackler and raced to the end zone, a 59-yard play to make it 14-7 late in the first quarter.\n\nKarl Joseph intercepted a deflected pass at the 50 and Oakland drove from there for the tying score. Carr threw 5 yards to Brandon LaFell for the touchdown .\n\nCarlson's 49-yard field goal on Oakland's first possession of the second half gave the Raiders the lead. Later in the quarter, the Raiders used 7:39 in a drive that stalled at the 1-yard line and Carlson's 21-yard field goal made it 20-14.\n\nBoth of Arizona's wins came against San Francisco. The 49ers, Cardinals and Raiders are now tied for the worst record in the NFL.\n\nTIMEOUT TROUBLES\n\nOakland drew a 5-yard penalty for calling consecutive timeouts in the second quarter. It moved what would have been a third-and-2 situation to third-and-7 and the Raiders failed to convert. Coach Jon Gruden was demonstrably upset with Carr afterward on the sideline.\n\nINJURIES\n\nRaiders: LaFell left in the second half with an Achilles tendon injury. Cornerback Leon Hall hurt his back in the first half.\n\nCardinals: Linebacker Deone Bucannon left with a chest injury in the second half.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRaiders: at Baltimore next Sunday.\n\nCardinals: at the Los Angeles Chargers next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The junior guard, a preseason All-American, missed her first six shots from the field before connecting on a 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"That was like the worst triple double I've ever had,\" said Ionescu, who also had seven turnovers. \"It almost shouldn't count, but it was just nice to see everyone else step up.\"\n\nShe also couldn't recall the last time she made just one field goal.\n\n\"No, I think this is the first and last time,\" Ionescu said. \"Sorry, Coach.\"\n\nNo apology was necessary.\n\n\"It's what makes her a great player,\" Oregon coach Kelly Graves said. \"Tonight she struggles from the field and she finds a way to get it done on the boards and with her assist game.

All five Oregon starters scored in double figures as Satou Sabally had 20 points, and Maite Cazorla and Erin Boley added 15 each.\n\n\"It shows we have great players and we can all step up and produce when we need to,\" Hebard said. \"It gives us a big confidence boost knowing that we have a lot of different threats we can use throughout the season.\"\n\nThe Ducks also made 34 of 38 free throws, including runs of 17 and 13 in a row, and held a 35-23 edge in rebounds.\n\nCierra Dillard led the Bulls (2-1) with 32 points and Courtney Wilkins added 19.\n\n\"We knew they were a good team and we knew Dillard was a great player, and she played like it tonight,\" Graves said.\n\nOregon led 49-39 after one half slowed to a crawl by 27 personal fouls and 31 free throws.\n\nThe Ducks were 12-for-24 from 3-point range, led by Boley's 5-for-8 effort, and held Buffalo to 9-for-31 shooting beyond the arc.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOregon continues to suit up only nine players, and all had played by the end of the first quarter, with German freshman Nyara Sabally out for the season with an ACL injury suffered in the FIBA U18 Euro title game. All five starters are averaging at least 12 points per game.\n\nBuffalo goes as far as Dillard can carry the scoring load, and the senior came within four of her career high, as she and Wilkins took 37 of the Bulls' 67 shots.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nBuffalo, a Sweet 16 team in 2018 that was ranked No. 21 in last season's final AP poll, received votes in first two polls of 2018-19.\n\nOregon snagged a first-place vote -- its first ever -- from defending champion Notre Dame but lost eight points in the Week 2 poll after its close call at home against No. 18 Syracuse. The Ducks' No. 3 ranking, an all-time best, seems secure for another week after two blowout victories.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nOregon opened the second half on a 19-8 run with Hebard scoring 11 points and Ionescu collecting five assists\n\nSTAT OF THE NIGHT\n\nBuffalo attempted more free throws (20) than Oregon's first three opponents combined. The Ducks have 109 attempts from the line through four games and are shooting 84.4 percent.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\nGraves picked up a rare technical foul in the first quarter after Hebard was called for an offensive foul when she tried to split two defenders for a shot in the lane. \"I earned it,\" the fifth-year coach said. \"I don't think I've had one in about three years and every once in a while, you just need it. Forgot to take my blood pressure pills or something today to calm me down. . When they reviewed it, they backed up my point, but then it was too late. I'd already said what I said.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBuffalo heads to Las Vegas to play Georgetown on Friday night and South Dakota State on Saturday night.\n\nOregon plays UC Riverside on Friday as part of the Saint Mary's Invitational in Moraga, California.

The win makes this the sixth consecutive year that Thompson has won at least once, extending the longest such active streak on the LPGA Tour.\n\nJutanugarn took the other two big prizes up for grabs, clinching the yearlong Race to the CME Globe prize \u2014 and the $1 million bonus that comes with that \u2014 as well as the Vare Trophy for winning the season's scoring title.

He earned $1,152,000 and a return trip to his hometown of Augusta, Georgia, in April to play in the Masters for the first time since 2012.\n\nAfter Rodgers sent a birdie attempt of 21 feet past the cup on the second extra hole, Howell's putt died in the cup and capped a comeback in which he went bogey-double bogey on his first two holes to lose the lead he had held through the first three rounds.\n\nHowell closed with a 3-under 67, birdieing Nos. 15-17, to match Rodgers at 19-under 263 in the final PGA Tour event of the year. After making the 36-hole cut on the 2-under number, Rodgers shot 61-62 on the weekend. Rodgers' 17-under 123 weekend was one shot off Troy Matteson's PGA Tour record for consecutive rounds of 122 set the 2009 Frys.com Championship.\n\nHowell had a 22-foot birdie attempt on the final hole to win in regulation, but the ball turned away from the cup inches from the edge. Both players had birdie looks on the first playoff hole, with Rodgers missing from 27 feet and Howell from 14 feet off the front fringe.\n\nHowell won for the first time since the 2007 at Riviera.

He earned a spot in the British Open at Royal Portrush by finishing among the top three players who weren't already exempt.\n\nAustralia's Dimitrios Papadatos was second after a 67, and countryman Jake McLeod was another shot back after a 66. They also earned spots at Royal Portrush.\n\n___\n\nOTHER TOURS\n\nKodai Ichihara rallied to win the Japan Golf Tour's Dunlop Phoenix, closing with an 8-under 63 for a one-stroke victory.

But the connection between Alex Smith and Joe Theismann gets far more eerie than that.\n\nJoe Theismann broke his right tibia and fibula on Nov. 18, 1985 in a game in Washington that ended 23-21. The only three-time Defensive Player of the Year Lawrence Taylor was involved in the injury, which occurred around the 40-yard line.
