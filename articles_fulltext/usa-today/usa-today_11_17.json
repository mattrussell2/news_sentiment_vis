(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) \u2014 Zach Abey ran for 128 yards with a pair of touchdowns and Navy snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 37-29 victory over Tulsa on Saturday.\n\nThe teams entered the game tied for last in the West Division of the American Athletic Conference.\n\nThe Midshipmen (3-8, 2-5 AAC) were able to distance themselves behind Abey, who was making his third straight start at quarterback and was effective running the triple-option attack.\n\nNavy amassed 389 yards on the ground and sent the Golden Hurricane (2-9, 1-6) to their ninth loss in 10 games.\n\nNavy slotback Malcolm Perry broke a 52-yard scamper early in third quarter that set up a short field goal by Bennett Moehring and increased its lead to 30-16. That run pushed Perry over 1,000 yards rushing for the second straight season.\n\nNavy fullback Mike Martin had a critical fumble that led to a 3-yard touchdown run by Tulsa running back Corey Taylor early in the fourth quarter. Midshipmen defensive end Jarvis Polu blocked the extra point to keep the deficit at eight points.\n\nTrey Walker answered on the ensuing possession when he took a pitch from Abey and ran 33 yards down the near sideline for a TD and a 37-22 lead.\n\nTulsa showed some life on a Taylor's third touchdown of the game with 4:46 remaining. However, Navy picked up a couple of first downs to seal the win.\n\nRedshirt freshman quarterback Seth Boomer was 19 of 28 for 206 yards with an interception for Tulsa.\n\nNavy fullback Nelson Smith had a pair of first-half touchdowns that provided a 13-7 lead early in the second quarter.\n\nNavy linebacker Austin Talbert-Loving was penalized for targeting on a kickoff return early in the second quarter and was ejected. Tulsa safety McKinley Winfield was called for the same infraction with just under 11 minutes left in the game.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTulsa: The Golden Hurricane have played mostly tough this season, losing five games by nine points or less. Tulsa can continue to build around sophomore running backs Shamari Brooks and Taylor, both of whom have helped carry the offense this year.\n\nNavy: The Midshipmen have one more game to accrue added momentum before the regular-season finale against archrival Army on Dec. 8. Navy will face a stern challenge against the Black Knights, who are 9-2 and have won the past two meetings. A victory would help Navy salvage something from an overall disappointing season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTulsa: Closes out the regular season against SMU on Saturday.\n\nNavy: Travels to Tulane Saturday for the final conference game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Peter Wallerstein said his organization completes animal rescues for Los Angeles County and went public with information about the incident this week.\n\nWhen Wallerstein responded to a call, he found a dolphin with an unusual hole in its skin. By the next day, an examination had revealed the animal had been shot.\n\nThe killing was a \u201cbrutal, senseless act of aggression\" likely carried out by a boater, Wallerstein said. Based on his knowledge of dolphin behavior, Wallerstein did not believe the dolphin could have been acting aggressively or the shooter could have been acting in self-defense.\n\n\u25ba Nov. 17: Dog found 'protecting the only house left on the block' after wildfire\n\n\u25ba Nov. 13: Animals affected by California wildfires\n\n\u25ba Nov. 13: Child 'heartbroken' after stuffed animal snake confiscated at airport\n\nThe dolphin likely was shot off the coast because that's where the protected species is most common. Wallerstein theorized the shooter was far enough off shore to be isolated: \u201cThey knew they weren\u2019t being watched.\u201d\n\nThe National Marine Fishery Service is investigating the incident, he said.\n\nWallerstein's organization is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to a conviction, he said Saturday. Previously, the group had advertised a $5,000 reward.\n\nSince 1972, the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act has covered dolphins and other ocean-going mammals including sea lions, manatees and whales.

Now as mysteriously as Lynch joined the Raiders, there are many questions about his future with the team. With signs pointing towards the legendary back\u2019s return to retirement, the Raiders are tasked with finding his replacement.\n\nWith so many picks in 2018, it won\u2019t be a surprise if the Raiders tap someone from the 2019 running back draft class as the heir to beast mode. Although the running back class is underwhelming at the top, there is some potential in the mid to late rounds. The Raiders are slated to have six picks late giving them the opportunity to take a chance on a running back that slides.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some potential players that could replace Lynch in Oakland:\n\nDamien Harris \u2014 RB \u2014 Alabama\n\nHarris may not have the gaudy numbers you\u2019d expect from a player coming out of the football machine known as Alabama, but that shouldn\u2019t affect his draft stock. Harris is a do it all back\u2014 he can run up the middle, on the outside, and in the red zone.\n\nOne of Harris\u2019s more underrated skills is his pass catching ability. He hasn\u2019t been asked to catch the ball a ton at Alabama but does show some potential out of the backfield. Harris doesn\u2019t have eye-popping burst or speed, but He has a knack for just finding the open space to get easy yardage using his vision. Harris will get some consideration as the top back in the 2019 class, along with Iowa State\u2019s David Montgomery.\n\nRound Grade: 2-3\n\nBenny Snell \u2014 RB \u2014 Kentucky\n\nAnother SEC back who has jumped up draft boards with an impressive 2018 season. Kentucky is fighting its way into football relevancy on the back of Benny Snell. Snell is one of college football\u2019s true bell cow types. He\u2019s been the center of Kentucky\u2019s offense since landing in Lexington as a freshman.\n\nSnell ran for over 1,000 yards and ten touchdowns in each season as a Wildcat. What makes Snell different in this 2019 class is his size at 5\u201910, 223 LBS which is big for this class. Snell fits in the NFL as a good combo, red zone back that fits in next to a slashing style back. Snell is one back in this class that could match Lynch\u2019s physicality as a runner.\n\nRound Grade: 4-6\n\nMyles Gaskin \u2014 RB \u2014 Washington\n\nAnother workhorse back in the 2019 class is Washington\u2019s, Myles Gaskin. Gaskin and Snell have had similar production at the college level, but are completely different as prospects. Gaskin is small, at 5\u20199, 190 lbs, but doesn\u2019t have the tools you\u2019d expect out of a smaller back. Gaskin isn\u2019t overwhelmingly fast but makes it up in a bevy of ways. He\u2019s a very unique back that uses patience to exploit holes in the defense.\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how different scouts evaluate Gaskin as he could be a great fit in the right offense, and a let down in others. Throughout the draft process, Gaskin will need to show he\u2019s a better pass catcher than what he\u2019s been at Washington over his career.\n\nRound Grade: 5-7\n\nDavid Montgomery \u2014 RB \u2014 Iowa State\n\nHeading into the 2018 season Montgomery gave the 2019 draft class hope, but his season so far has been somewhat underwhelming. Montgomery has dealt with injuries and had a few good games, but hasn\u2019t had the type of production you\u2019d like to see in one of the most innovative offenses in the country.\n\nThe Cyclones head coach Matt Campbell is being touted as one of the countries best play callers but hasn\u2019t got the best out of Montgomery. Montgomery\u2019s letdown 2018 shouldn\u2019t have a massive effect on his draft stock as this is such a slim group at running back.\n\nAs for Montgomery\u2019s skill set, he has a bit of everything you want in a pro-style back. Balance, size, and versatility are all there, where he lacks in speed, he makes up for in yards after contact. Montgomery has a little beast mode to his game, as he\u2019s been a menace to bring down for Big 12 defenses, something that should translate to the pro level.\n\nRound Grade: 2-4\n\nTravis Homer \u2014 RB \u2014 Miami\n\nTravis Homer could be the steal of the running back class out of Miami. Even in a down year, Miami continues to the churn out NFL talent like Homer. Homer isn\u2019t at the top of many draft boards but has a lot of skills you want in a modern day pro back. He has size at 5\u201911 195 to pair with his shifty running style.\n\nAlthough Homer doesn\u2019t have a ton of catches this season, he projects to be an impressive receiving back. Homer\u2019s lack of receptions might be a product of Miami\u2019s offense.\n\nHomer also has had to run behind a Miami offensive line that hasn\u2019t done him any favors.

North Carolina improved to 8-0 under Fedora against teams from the Football Championship Subdivision, winning those games by an average of almost 37 points per game.\n\nHAIL MARY\n\nMiles subbed in for Elliott at the end of the first half because he has a stronger arm and would be able to get the ball to the end zone. His pass was deflected in the end zone before Bargas caught it, setting off a wild celebration in which Miles sprinted down the field giving five to his teammates. The party continued after the game, where his father, mother and two sisters watched him answer questions.\n\n\"When you're a kid, you dream about playing college football, and you dream about scoring touchdowns and throwing it and running it,\" Miles said. \"For it all to happen at the end and for your first throw to be a touchdown like that, it's pretty awesome.\"\n\nMILESTONE PERFORMANCE\n\nAdams became the 10th player in FCS history to pass for 2,000 yards and run for 1,000 yards in the same season. He entered the game needing 98 rushing yards to reach 1,000. After three quarters, he had 15 attempts for a net total of minus-3 yards. But he ripped off runs of 23, 11 and 23 yards on the first three plays of the fourth quarter, and he ran for 18 yards on the final play of the game to finish with 1,006 rushing yards for the season.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nNorth Carolina tailback Michael Carter departed midway through the first quarter after appearing to injure his right arm. He did not return. The Tar Heels also lost starting defensive tackle Jason Strowbridge, who limped off the field with an injured right leg in the second quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWestern Carolina: The Catamounts begin getting ready for 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina: The Tar Heels wrap up their season at home against rival North Carolina State, which has won three of the last four in the series.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A few weeks later, the same became true for Kyle Busch.\n\nA quarter of the way into a 36-race season, Harvick and Busch had each recorded three-race win streaks. Fast forward to the Cup Series finale \u2014 Sunday\u2019s Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway \u2014 and they\u2019re tied for the most wins in the series this season with eight apiece, matching a career-high for Busch and setting a personal best for Harvick.\n\nSo it\u2019s far from surprising that the No. 4 Ford and No. 18 Toyota are two of the final four teams racing for a championship. It\u2019d actually be a disappointment if they weren\u2019t, and if neither of them win their second Cup Series title Sunday, that, too, would be a disappointingly anticlimactic end to two exceptionally dominant seasons.\n\nThat\u2019s not a knock against defending Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Joey Logano, the other two drivers competing for the title. They\u2019re both skilled racers who deserve to be among the Championship 4, with Truex having four checkered flags and Logano with two as he and his team found their rhythm through the first nine playoff races. Their teams are certainly worthy of winning a title.\n\nAs we so often see in sports, sometimes, the best team doesn\u2019t win the championship. But with the Big Three \u2014 the season-long nickname dealt to Harvick, Busch and Truex \u2014 among the championship contenders, the best NASCAR teams are actually fighting for the trophy, which is great for the struggling sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly been a successful year, but I don\u2019t think it would be truly successful without being able to bring home that championship,\u201d Busch said Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt depends on who you lose it to. Obviously, Harvick\u2019s done a phenomenal job. Those guys and that group have been so good all season long, even in the late stages of last year. You lose it to him, and it\u2019s like, yeah OK, I can see why they got it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Truex is among the dominant three, Harvick and Busch \u2014 who were the Cup Series champions in 2014 and 2015, respectively \u2014 are in their own zip code and have been for the majority of the season. Along with their eight wins each, Harvick and Busch have led almost 34 percent of the 9,983 laps this year combined \u2014 and the No. 4 team is at nearly 20 percent on its own.\n\nEven when they don\u2019t win a race, they\u2019re often still in it by the end. Harvick has 22 top-5 finishes, and Busch has 21. And when they\u2019ve occasionally started races toward the back of the field, they\u2019ve flexed their speed and caught up to the front. Friday, Busch qualified second, while Harvick will start from the 12th spot.\n\nTheir teams haven\u2019t had to be perfect to win \u2014 though they might have to be Sunday as they race each other, first and foremost \u2014 but, as Logano previously told For The Win, everyone else has to be perfect to beat them.\n\n\u201cI know how hard this is, and I know that there are so many things that can go wrong,\u201d Harvick said while explaining why he won\u2019t call it a disappointing season if he doesn\u2019t win.\n\n\u201cSometimes you\u2019re going to win, sometimes you\u2019re going to lose. I think we\u2019re in a better position to win this year than we were last year. I know that for sure because of the speed of the cars. I look at this year from a speed of the car standpoint, and it\u2019s just as good as the year we won the championship.\u201d\n\nHis fans \u2014 and, separately, Busch\u2019s \u2014 might feel differently if their driver isn\u2019t hoisting a trophy.\n\nHarvick\u2019s and Busch\u2019s cars have earned the right to be called the fastest of the 2018 season \u2014 no matter what happens at Homestead \u2014 and if one of them wins Sunday, it will be easy to declare him the best of the best this season. If Truex or Logano win, we\u2019ll talk about their impressive performance or clever strategy in this particular event and the playoffs overall. We\u2019ll repeatedly break down how they beat the other three championship contenders.\n\nBut the prowess of Harvick and Busch will still remain the major takeaway this season.\n\nEveryone loves crazy upsets and wild finishes, and that would certainly make for an entertaining end to the season. Logano could win his first championship, while Truex could be the first driver to defend his title in eight years and do it in his team\u2019s final race before closing up shop.\n\nBut it just seems like Harvick and Busch have already earned the right to be NASCAR\u2019s champion. Their last 10 months have been aggressively building up to this moment. Now, one of them just has to take it."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Eastern Kentucky beats Tennessee Tech 37-6", "description": "Parker McKinney passed for 333 yards and two touchdowns and ran for another, and Eastern Kentucky beat Tennessee Tech 37-6 to finish the regular season with four straight wins", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/17/eastern-kentucky-beats-tennessee-tech-37-6/38553759/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T23:21:22Z", "content": "COOKEVILLE, Tenn.

(Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Tyler Reddick opened Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s first season in retirement with a victory and closed it with a championship.\n\nReddick won the Xfinity Series finale Saturday at Homestead-Miami Speedway to claim the title in NASCAR's developmental series. Reddick was perhaps a long shot behind Christopher Bell and Cole Custer, but with team owner Earnhardt watching from his pit box, he drove away from the contenders and bookended his rookie season with two massive trips to victory lane.\n\n\"I just knew we had to execute. I thought we had a chance if we just made it to Homestead, it rewards my aggression,\" Reddick said. \"We hit the wall a lot, but the car kept in one piece, enough for me to get to the end. It was an up and down year. We did everything we had to do in the playoffs and we wound up with the championship.\n\n\"We can hang our hats on that and people will say others were more consistent. We got it when it counted.\"\n\nThe 22-year-old began this season with a victory at Daytona International Speedway in which he beat JRM teammate Elliott Sadler in the closest finish in NASCAR history. His next win was in the finale with everything on the line.\n\nIt was Reddick's final race for JR Motorsports, which won its second consecutive Xfinity championship and third in five years. Reddick is moving to Richard Childress Racing next season and will race against JRM.\n\nBut he got one final party with his team, albeit without the massive Xfinity championship flag. The flag got caught under his tires as Reddick waved it out his window during celebratory burnouts and he was left with the tattered, burnt remains.\n\nTyler Reddick's epic burnout takes out Xfinity flag https://t.co/x27FoVmGX5 \u2014 Flyin18T (@Flyin18T) November 17, 2018\n\n\"I'm really sad my flag didn't last very long. I already ripped it apart,\" he said. \"But I was determined to get to fourth gear and burn this thing down. I picked a really good time to get my life together and win a race.\"\n\nEarnhardt marveled at how Reddick commanded the top lane of the track. Reddick was able to make the No. 9 Chevrolet stick along the outside wall when other drivers could not and didn't falter even when his car bounced off the concrete several times.\n\n\"Tyler had the speed and the nerve to run the laps he needed to keep the lead,\" Earnhardt said. \"I'm telling you, to run on that fence like he did at the end of that race, it takes some precision. He did such an amazing job doing that. He earned the victory. He earned the championship.\"\n\nCuster won the pole and the first two stages of the race, but his title hopes were dashed by questionable pit strategy that cost him the lead, the victory and the title. He finished second behind Reddick in a Ford for Stewart-Haas Racing.\n\nDaniel Hemric didn't contend at Homestead and finished fourth in the race, third in the championship standings.\n\nChristopher Bell did briefly challenge but was passed by both Reddick and then Custer in the final stage. A late flat tire dropped Bell to 11th, and he finished last in the championship field. Bell won a series-high seven races this season, the most for an Xfinity regular since Earnhardt Jr. also won seven times in 1998.\n\nThe Xfinity Series is where NASCAR's future stars are groomed and the championship field Saturday represented all three manufacturers, four different teams and four drivers in their 20s.\n\nIt was the final event for Sadler, a JR Motorsports driver who is calling it a career after 23 seasons. He toasted his crew with beer at his race car after the race.\n\nBrett Moffitt won the Truck Series title Friday night in a caution-free race, and Reddick's run also was free of yellow flags. Chevy and Toyota each have a championship this weekend, and Ford will try to claim its first Cup title since 2004 on Sunday.\n\nFord's Stewart-Haas Racing claimed the Xfinity owners championship and had another chance Sunday at a title with Kevin Harvick in NASCAR's final four.\n\n\"We're proud as an organization to win an owners championship, but we wanted to do it with our driver and win a drivers' championship,\" team co-owner Tony Stewart said. \"You take the lump but the goal was to win Cole a driver championship.\""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Old Dominion ends with a bang in 77-14 win over VMI", "description": "Matt Geiger scored three touchdowns, Kesean Strong and Jeremy Cox each scored two touchdowns and Old Dominion beat VMI 77-14", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/17/old-dominion-ends-with-a-bang-in-77-14-win-over-vmi/38553559/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e93b3dba2878c6979b7d1c4ad4c68644c4f9287/c=153-0-3015-1610/local/-/media/2018/11/17/USATODAY/usatsports/6f8bbd3961ff416fae667dcb2df1a6b1.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T23:11:53Z", "content": "Old Dominion's Jeremy Cox brought down yard short of the goal line by VMI defenders during an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018, in Norfolk, Va.

The ensuing kickoff was returned to midfield by Montana's Malik Flowers to ensure a tense finish.\n\nThe Grizzlies drove to the 1-yard line and appeared to get a go-ahead scoring run from Adam Eastwood, before it was waived off because MSU coach Jeff Choate called time out.\n\nWith 12 seconds left, Montana lined up for the same play and Eastwood lost the ball on a hit by MSU's Tucker Yates. Derek Marks recovered for the Bobcats (7-4, 5-3 Big Sky Conference).\n\n\"Quite honestly, just processing this - it's probably not going to hit me for a while,\" said Choate, who is now 3-0 in his MSU career against the Grizzlies. \"There's a lot that happened in that fourth quarter, and some of it seems like a blur.\"\n\nJones' touchdown, off an option pitch, came a few moments after Montana State forced a fumble by Montana quarterback Dalton Sneed and Grant Collins recovered for MSU.\n\nIt was the first turnover of the game, but MSU already had momentum.\n\nAfter Montana drove to a 34-yard Tim Semenza field goal and a 25-15 lead with 7:46 left in the game, sophomore quarterback Troy Andersen quickly guided the Bobcats 75 yards, capped by his third short scoring run. The gap was 25-22 with 6:01 remaining.\n\nAnderson scored his first TD with 23 seconds left in the first half, capping another long drive and taking some starch out of the record crowd of 26,508 at Washington-Grizzly Stadium.\n\n\"That was huge,\" Choate said. \"Going in down 22-0 would have been pretty much all uphill sledding the second half.\"\n\n\"A little bit early we just got out of sorts,\" said Andersen, who ran for 107 yards and threw for 158 more. \"The moment was a little bit big for us, but we kind of got settled down and started doing our jobs.\"\n\nMontana (6-5, 4-4) came out strong, scoring on its first drive. Sneed, who threw for 354 yards, shoveled a 1-yard scoring pass to Gabe Sulser on a \"fly sweep\" to put the Grizzlies up 7-0.\n\nThe lead grew to 14-0 at 13:30 of the second quarter, when Eastwood capped a 58-yard drive with a 1-yard run. After a rare short punt by MSU's Jered Padmos left Montana with a short field, Sneed found Samuel Akem with a 37-yard scoring pass at 8:15 of the second quarter.\n\nHolder Reid Miller ran in the 2-point conversion for the 22-0 lead.\n\nThen the Grizzlies, who squandered leads in home losses to Portland State and UC Davis, began to falter.

Semenza missed a field goal in the third quarter. Semenza's 34-yarder came after Sneed converted third-and-long passes covering 20, 18 and 29 yards. Then the drive stalled.\n\n\"I think our quarterback's a special player. I really do,\" Hauck said of Sneed, who completed 22 of 34 passes. \"He made some great throws.

(AP) \u2014 After two blowout wins to start the season, Miami finally overcame a difficult test.\n\nChris Lykes scored 21 points as the Hurricanes fought off Bethune Cookman for a 78-70 victory Saturday afternoon.\n\nLykes' two free throws with 2:19 remaining gave the Hurricanes (3-0) the lead for good at 69-67. Anthony Lawrence, DJ Vasiljevic and Lykes hit 3-pointers in the final two minutes to secure Miami's 19th straight home win against a non-Atlantic Coast Conference opponent.\n\n\"We're going to face adversity a lot, especially during the ACC,\" said Lykes, who scored 19 points in the second half and shot 6 of 10 from the field. \"It is very competitive during that part of the season. Any type of competition like that is going to make us better.\"\n\nVasiljevic scored 20 points and Lawrence finished with 13 points.\n\n\"Full credit to Bethune Cookman and how they came out,\" Vasiljevic said. \"They played with a lot of energy. They jumped on us and made things difficult. But for me and Chris to come down the stretch and get the crowd into it and then hit those big shots, it's what college basketball is all about.\"\n\nThe Wildcats (2-3) rallied from a 10-point deficit early in the second half and took a 50-48 lead on Wali Parks' basket with 9:16 remaining. Miami built a 67-61 lead on Lawrence's two free throws with 4:21 before Bethune Cookman ran off six unanswered points capped by Malik Maitland's two free throws with 2:38 left.\n\n\"I thought we were tough, I thought we were gritty,\" Bethune Cookman coach Ryan Ridder said. \"Having the opportunity to come in and play a top 25 caliber program, I thought we competed the right way. Proud of our guys' effort, just fell short in those last four minutes or so.\"\n\nMaitland scored a game-high 29 points for the Wildcats. He shot 11 of 16 from the field, including 5 of 7 from behind the arc.\n\n\"You really have to give a lot of credit to Bethune Cookman their players and their coaches for coming in here and playing as well as they did,\" Miami coach Jim Larranaga said. \"Maitland was absolutely terrific.\"\n\nBethune Cookman twice built seven-point leads in the first half. Houston Smith's layup with 4:04 remaining gave the Wildcats their second seven-point advantage before the Hurricanes finished the half on an 11-4 run.\n\n\"Even though they jumped on us early and we didn't get off to a great start we finished strong,\" Vasiljevic said. \"Coach always emphasizes the game is 40 minutes long it's not 15 or 20.\"\n\nREVERSAL OF SHOOTING WOES:\n\nLykes shot 1 of 6 from the field in the first half and his shooting struggles reflected Miami's woes as it shot a collective 28 percent.

For our guys, five straight games, we can say we found a way to get better. If that trend continues, hopefully we'll be playing our best basketball in March.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE:\n\nBethune Cookman: The Wildcats are predicted to finish first in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference for the first time in program history. The return of four starters and nine players from last year's squad which tied for the MEAC regular season championship factored heavily in the pre-season outlook.\n\nMiami: Forward Anthony Walker, of Nottingham, Md., and guard Isaiah Wong, of Trenton, N.J., signed national letters of intent to play with the Hurricanes next season.

If we do a good job there and win our game then we would have won all our games and we'll let people decide who should go to the playoffs.\"\n\nNotre Dame held out Book from last week's home game against Florida State with a rib injury. He wasn't missed as the Irish (11-0, No. 3 CFP) rolled with Brandon Wimbush at quarterback.\n\nThey clearly wanted to be cautious with Book ahead of their trip to the Bronx to face high-scoring Syracuse (8-3, No. 12 CFP), averaging 44 points per game. Book, the junior quarterback who took over as the starter four games into the season, looked good as new.\n\n\"The ribs feel good,\" Book said. \"Wasn't even thinking about them during the game.\"\n\nDonning pinstripe uniforms in a tribute to the usual residents of the ballpark, Notre Dame went up 7-0 on its second possession on a 9-yard pass from Book to Dexter Williams.\n\nThe Subway Alumni, along with the bridge and tunnel crowd, packed Yankee Stadium on a 45-degree day in the Bronx. The sellout crowd was announced at 48,104.\n\nThat the Fighting Irish were playing such an important game away from South Bend, Indiana, did not sit well with most of their fans. Even Kelly said it was not ideal. Part of the Shamrock Series, the off-site \"home\" games Notre Dame plays almost annually, the Irish's second trip to the new Yankee Stadium had been in the works for several years.\n\nAdding to the anxiety of playing a Syracuse team having its best season in more than a decade was Notre Dame's unusual stretch schedule. Notre Dame has played only one home game since mid-October and the trip to USC will be its second to the West Coast in five weeks.\n\nTurns out, there was nothing to worry about in New York. The most significant college football game at Yankee Stadium since No. 1 Army and No. 2 Notre Dame played a 0-0 tie in 1946 was no Game of the Century.\n\n\"We've played in California, Chicago and New York,\" Book said. \"I think it's awesome. I think it's great experiences for us. We might have to fly a little bit more than other teams but I don't think it hurts anyone.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSyracuse: The Orange played most of the game without starting quarterback Eric Dungey, who left in the first quarter with what the school said was an upper-body injury. Coach Dino Babers said they would know more about Dungey's condition when he was examined upon return to Syracuse.\n\nTommy DeVito, who came off the bench earlier this season to relieve Dungey against North Carolina and lead the Orange to an overtime victory, stepped in but looked overmatched. The redshirt freshman was sacked six times and picked off twice.\n\nNotre Dame: Only a field goal with 10 seconds left denied the Irish their first shutout since Sept. 6, 2014, when they beat Michigan 31-0 in South Bend.\n\nSCOUTING REPORT\n\nSyracuse has played both No. 2 Clemson and Notre Dame this season, losing a close game in Death Valley.\n\n\"I will tell you this: Notre Dame is better than what people think they are,\" Babers said. \"That's a really, really good football team. All I'll say is this: Clemson is extremely talented. So I think there's no doubt those two teams are in the top four in the country.\"\n\nBATTER UP\n\nNotre Dame improved 17-6-3 all-time at Yankee Stadium, including 3-0 at the newest version since Kelly took over.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSyracuse: Finishes the regular season at No. 22 Boston College.\n\nNotre Dame: The Irish have not won at USC since 2012, when the victory locked up a spot in the BCS championship game.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

The winning score even went up \u2014 briefly \u2014 on the scoreboard only to be wiped out by reality.\n\nCollin Hill's apparent 34-yard touchdown pass to Preston Williams with no time left was negated by penalty, allowing No. 14 Utah State to escape with a 29-24 victory Saturday in a wild, stunning finish to a game played in snow and freezing rain.\n\n\"Survive and advance. Just like in the NCAA Tournament,\" said Utah State coach Matt Wells, who was both relieved and ecstatic. \"You know, I'm going to celebrate after a win like this. I'm going to let the players celebrate all the way until Monday. We have a special season going.\"\n\nThe Rams, denied in their bid for their first win over a ranked team since 2002, were flagged for illegal touching after it was determined that Williams had stepped out of bounds and was the first to touch the ball when he came back in bounds and made the leaping catch between defenders in the end zone.\n\n\"I was proud of the effort and the fight and the heart,\" Colorado State coach Mike Bobo said when asked what he told his team. \"There's a lot of hurt in that locker room right today because they played their tails off. We looked like a football team today really for the first time this year.\"\n\nThe call set off a bizarre scene in which the celebrating Rams team suddenly went silent on the field with the sideline for Utah State (10-1, 7-0 Mountain West) going from dejection to jubilation in winning its school-record 10th in a row.\n\n\"I have never been a part of something like that,\" said linebacker Jontrell Rocquemore, who had one of Utah State's two interception returns for touchdowns. \"I've never seen something like that. I went from my all-time low, to, 'Oh, my gosh. I just won!' Sometimes, winning is ugly.\"\n\nHill understood the swirl of emotions from the other end of the spectrum.\n\n\"It was probably like the ultimate high, then pretty low,\" he said. \"Thinking you'd won the game and then it gets reversed on you. It's kind of tough.\"\n\nThe teams scored two touchdowns in the last 1:36 of the game.\n\nJordan Love threw a go-ahead 33-yard touchdown pass to Aaren Vaughns with 43 seconds remaining, the first offensive touchdown of the day for the Aggies, who came in with the nation's top-scoring offense, averaging 51.3 points per game.\n\n\"I was wide open,\" Vaughns said. \"I said, 'J-Love get me the ball. I'm wide open,' and he did.\"\n\nThat score came on the heels of Hill's 17-yard touchdown pass to Williams with 1:36 remaining.\n\nHill, who had two interceptions returned for touchdowns by Aggies defenders, came back to throw for the score two plays after Deven Thompkins muffed a punt that was recovered by Colorado State at the Aggies' 20-yard line.\n\nTrailing by 10 points, the Rams (3-8, 2-5) drove nearly the length of the field and pulled to within 20-17 on Hill's 9-yard touchdown pass to Williams with 10:36 remaining. The drive was kept alive by punter Ryan Stonehouse's fourth-down pass completion to V.J. Banks.\n\nSafety Aaron Wade's 95-yard interception return early in the second quarter stood out as Utah State's lone touchdown until linebacker Jontrell Rocquemore picked off another wayward pass from and returned it 32 yards to give Utah State a 20-10 lead with 2:37 remaining in the third quarter. Dominik Eberle kicked his second field goal, a 26-yarder, earlier in the third to break a 10-10 tie.\n\nUtah State's high-powered offense made little headway in the first half and the Aggies led 10-7 at intermission because of defense and special teams.\n\nColorado State was poised for an early score when Wade came up with his team-leading third interception of the season. He caught a deflection off the hands of Williams and sprinted untouchded down the right sideline to match the fourth longest interception return in Utah State's history.\n\nUtah State's first scoring drive stalled on a third-down incompletion and Eberle came on to kick a 23-yard field goal, the only first quarter score.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUtah State: The Aggies' offense finally came to life by scoring a touchdown in the waning moments and it was just enough for the win after a penalty call negated the Rams' last-second score.\n\nColorado State: The Rams nearly pulled off a major upset by stifling the nation's top-scoring offense. It just wasn't quite enough.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUtah State: Concludes regular season Saturday at No. 23 Boise State with the Mountain West Mountain Division title on the line.\n\nColorado State: Rounds out the season Saturday at Air Force.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Rich Barnes, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 No. 3 Notre Dame made it look easy with a 36-3 win against No. 12 Syracuse at Yankee Stadium. With one game left in the regular season, the Irish are close to going unbeaten in the regular season and securing a spot in the College Football Playoff. Here are three takeaways from the win:\n\nThis was impressive. But also not. An injury to quarterback Eric Dungey in the first quarter essentially ended chance Syracuse had of notching an upset of the third-ranked Irish \u2014 not that the Orange were doing much even with Dungey in the lineup. Notre Dame did what a team knocking on the door of the Playoff should: Take care of business against an opponent struggling with injuries and weather. Defensively, the Irish put together the sort of performance that bodes well for a potential postseason matchup with one of the many spread-based teams crowding the top of the Playoff rankings. Notre Dame's defense has been outstanding for much of the regular season. The Syracuse field goal came with 10 seconds left.\n\nMore: No. 8 Ohio State keeps playoff hopes alive by surviving at Maryland in overtime 52-51\n\nMore: The Citadel has some fun on Twitter at No. 1 Alabama's expense after entering halftime tied\n\nAnd the offense was efficient on a down-by-down basis and often explosive, just not when it mattered: when knocking on the door of the Syracuse end zone. The 20-0 edge at halftime should've been more, but the Irish were stymied by a handful of self-inflicted errors near the goal line \u2014 such as a holding penalty on one series and a botched quarterback-center exchange on another. Both drives should've ended in a touchdown. It didn't matter against Syracuse, largely due to the stingy play of the defense. But a failure to convert in those situations would be magnified in a hypothetical pairing with Alabama or Clemson in a national semifinal. In the Irish's defense, ti hasn't been a season-long issue: Notre Dame entered the weekend ranked 28th nationally in red-zone scoring.\n\nIan Book looked healthy. This was a positive sign for the Irish, who were without their starting quarterback in last week's 42-13 win against Florida State. It's clear that this offense operates at a higher gear with Book, who was inserted into the lineup in September, so to see the junior comfortable in the pocket as a thrower and agile on the run eases any worries over the health of Notre Dame's starter heading into the final week of the regular season. Book threw for 292 yards and 2 touchdowns before being replaced by backup Brandon Wimbush midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nOne more test. The Irish close the regular season with a road trip to Southern California, one of college football\u2019s most disappointing teams, needing a win against the rival Trojans to lock in a berth in the College Football Playoff. There\u2019s no argument on this fact: Notre Dame is in the four-team field at 12-0, with only seeding left to be determined. Whether that Playoff berth resembles the program\u2019s last trip on college football\u2019s biggest stage \u2013 a complete wipeout against Alabama in early 2013 \u2013 remains to be seen.\n\nThere may even be an argument for the Irish cracking the final top four at 11-1, though not without help. For one, Michigan would need to beat Ohio State next Saturday and Northwestern a week later to win the Big Ten Conference; the Irish topped the Wolverines in the season opener. It would also help one-loss Notre Dame to have some chaos in the Big 12 Conference, where Oklahoma and West Virginia top the list of Playoff contenders."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Forbes, Villanova top Delaware for Battle of the Blue trophy", "description": "Aaron Forbes rushed for 138 yards and a career-high three touchdowns, Zach Bednarczyk passed for 269 yards and a touchdown in his final game with Villanova, and the Wildcats upset Delaware 42-21 for the Battle of the Blue trophy", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/17/forbes-villanova-top-delaware-for-battle-of-the-blue-trophy/38553423/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T22:58:35Z", "content": "NEWARK, Del.

You lose it to him, and it\u2019s like, yeah OK, I can see why they got it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Truex is among the dominant three, Harvick and Busch \u2014 who were the Cup Series champions in 2014 and 2015, respectively \u2014 are in their own zip code and have been for the majority of the season. Along with their eight wins each, Harvick and Busch have led almost 34 percent of the 9,983 laps this year combined \u2014 and the No. 4 team is at nearly 20 percent on its own.\n\nEven when they don\u2019t win a race, they\u2019re often still in it by the end. Harvick has 22 top-5 finishes, and Busch has 21. And when they\u2019ve occasionally started races toward the back of the field, they\u2019ve flexed their speed and caught up to the front. Friday, Busch qualified second, while Harvick will start from the 12th spot.\n\nTheir teams haven\u2019t had to be perfect to win \u2014 though they might have to be Sunday as they race each other, first and foremost \u2014 but, as Logano previously told For The Win, everyone else has to be perfect to beat them.\n\n\u201cI know how hard this is, and I know that there are so many things that can go wrong,\u201d Harvick said while explaining why he won\u2019t call it a disappointing season if he doesn\u2019t win.\n\n\u201cSometimes you\u2019re going to win, sometimes you\u2019re going to lose. I think we\u2019re in a better position to win this year than we were last year. I know that for sure because of the speed of the cars. I look at this year from a speed of the car standpoint, and it\u2019s just as good as the year we won the championship.\u201d\n\nHis fans \u2014 and, separately, Busch\u2019s \u2014 might feel differently if their driver isn\u2019t hoisting a trophy.\n\nHarvick\u2019s and Busch\u2019s cars have earned the right to be called the fastest of the 2018 season \u2014 no matter what happens at Homestead \u2014 and if one of them wins Sunday, it will be easy to declare him the best of the best this season. If Truex or Logano win, we\u2019ll talk about their impressive performance or clever strategy in this particular event and the playoffs overall. We\u2019ll repeatedly break down how they beat the other three championship contenders.\n\nBut the prowess of Harvick and Busch will still remain the major takeaway this season.\n\nEveryone loves crazy upsets and wild finishes, and that would certainly make for an entertaining end to the season. Logano could win his first championship, while Truex could be the first driver to defend his title in eight years and do it in his team\u2019s final race before closing up shop.\n\nBut it just seems like Harvick and Busch have already earned the right to be NASCAR\u2019s champion. Their last 10 months have been aggressively building up to this moment. Now, one of them just has to take it."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Bahar throws for 5 TDs, Monmouth rolls over Gardner-Webb", "description": "Kenji Bahar threw for a career-high 407 yards and five touchdowns as Monmouth closed out the regular season with a 56-42 victory over Gardner-Webb on Saturday afternoon", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/17/bahar-throws-for-5-tds-monmouth-rolls-over-gardner-webb/38553393/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T22:56:17Z", "content": "BOILING SPRINGS, N.C.

Peter Wallerstein said his organization completes animal rescues for Los Angeles County and went public with information about the incident this week.\n\nWhen Wallerstein responded to a call, he found a dolphin with an unusual hole in its skin. By the next day, an examination had revealed the animal had been shot.\n\nThe killing was a \u201cbrutal, senseless act of aggression\" likely carried out by a boater, Wallerstein said. Based on his knowledge of dolphin behavior, Wallerstein did not believe the dolphin could have been acting aggressively or the shooter could have been acting in self-defense.\n\n\u25ba Nov. 17: Dog found 'protecting the only house left on the block' after wildfire\n\n\u25ba Nov. 13: Animals affected by California wildfires\n\n\u25ba Nov. 13: Child 'heartbroken' after stuffed animal snake confiscated at airport\n\nThe dolphin likely was shot off the coast because that's where the protected species is most common.

We've got to get him better.\"\n\nCurry missed his fifth straight game on Saturday with a strained left groin, and is likely to miss at least another week before he's cleared to return. He wasn't in Los Angeles for the Clippers game.\n\n\"It's been different. It's been tough,\" Curry said. \"Obviously it sucks not being able to play, sucks when you're not with the team and something like that happens.\"\n\nCurry was asked why he thinks Durant and Green will reconcile.\n\n\"They have a lot of equity built in their relationship,\" Curry said. \"They've won championships together. They've brought out the best in each other. Obviously, I don't think they've had an incident to this level, but you don't have the experiences that you've had and go through the journey that we've been on and let it be derailed by something like that.\"\n\nThe Warriors are trying this season to join only the Boston Celtics, Los Angeles Lakers and Chicago Bulls as franchises to win three consecutive NBA titles.\n\nCurry said that will be foremost in the Warriors' collective thoughts going forward.\n\n\"We have the opportunity to do something extremely special this year,\" Curry said. \"There's going to be ups and downs and bumps in the road, whether it's self-inflicted or whether it's from outside. At the end of the day nothing should distract us from what our goal is.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 It was the No. 21 Utah Utes who weathered this storm, and they have a trip to their first Pac-12 title game to show for it.\n\nJason Shelley threw for 221 yards and two touchdowns and the Utes mastered the sloppy conditions in a 30-7 rout of Colorado in freezing rain and snow Saturday.\n\n\"It doesn't bother us a bit,\" coach Kyle Whittingham said. \"We are up in the mountains in Salt Lake City, so not a problem at all. Our guys handled it very well. It didn't faze them.\"\n\nSo comfortable were the Utes (8-3, 6-3) that several of them warmed up shirtless.\n\n\"We're from Utah, so it's not like we don't play in the cold weather, too. It was nothing to us,\" said linebacker Francis Bernard, who had to step in for star Chase Hansen, who was ejected for targeting.\n\nBuffs senior wide receiver Jay MacIntyre, on the other hand, wasn't accustomed to the foul weather.\n\n\"No, not really. This was the first real time\" playing a game in snow, he said. \"Me and my brother and my friends would go at night to my high school and go play in the snow sometimes. That was fun. But other than that, not really. Not like a real game.\"\n\nThe Utes flew home assured of at least a share of the Pac-12 title.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" Utes kicker Matt Gay said. \"I don't think Utah has ever had a Pac-12 title, and we don't like sharing. We did our part and we feel good about that, we're hoping for someone else to do theirs and give us the full reigns of that title.\"\n\nThe Oregon Ducks did just that with a 31-29 win over Arizona State later Saturday night, sending the Utes to their first conference championship appearance since joining the Pac-12 in 2011.\n\nThey'll face either eighth-ranked Washington State or No. 17 Washington.\n\nA sixth consecutive loss for the Buffaloes (5-6, 2-6) capped a week in which athletic director Rick George said he hadn't made any decisions regarding coach Mike MacIntyre's employment amid a news report that his job was in jeopardy.\n\n\"No, I don't feel like it was my last game,\" MacIntyre said. \"We've got one more. Hopefully we can win that and go to a bowl game.\"\n\nMacIntyre brought a photo of a bison heading into a storm into his weekly news conference, a metaphor that was both apt and prescient \u2014 freezing drizzle ahead of a snowstorm turned the first half of the 500th game played at Folsom Field into a sloppy mess that resulted in a 7-7 first-half yawner.\n\nMacIntyre said he realizes the nature of college coaching: win and you're asked when you're leaving; lose and you're peppered with questions about an exit.\n\nSUPER SUBS\n\nWhile the Buffs continued to stagger through their worst injury epidemic in 33 years, the Utes won for the second straight week after losing QB Tyler Huntley and star running back Zack Moss to season-ending injuries.\n\nColorado, which started out 5-0, fell to 0-9 over the last two years when playing for bowl eligibility.\n\nDespite losing Hansen on a targeting call in the first quarter, the Utes stymied Colorado's offense even as quarterback Steven Montez had his full complement of receivers available for the first time in two months.\n\nHALFTIME ADJUSTMENTS\n\nThe Buffs managed just 19 yards in the third quarter, when the Utes took control with a 17-0 run.\n\n\"It was just better execution,\" Whittingham said. \"We did have some guys change cleats in the second half. ... But, no, nothing major, nothing drastic as far as wholesale change.\"\n\nMatt Gay gave Utah its first lead with a 33-yard field goal, Shelley threw a 47-yard TD to fellow freshman Jaylen Dixon and Armand Shyne ran it in from a yard out to make it 24-7.\n\n\"We just couldn't make a tackle,\" Buffaloes linebacker Rick Gamboa said.\n\nMike MacIntyre said, \"I thought we played really hard in the first half. Second half, we're just inept on offense right now. That's the best way to put it.\"\n\nShyne's 55 yards on 17 carries led a Utah ground game that outpaced Colorado's 169 yards to 34.\n\nTravon McMillian gave the Buffaloes a 7-0 lead with a 13-yard touchdown run in the first quarter.

(AP Photo/Stephen B. Morton) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Two quick birdies and Charles Howell III was five shots ahead.\n\nFour hours later, he was reminded why winning never comes easily, especially for someone who has gone more than 11 years and 332 starts since his last victory.\n\nHowell didn't make enough birdies Saturday to do much of anything except post a 2-under 68 and keep his name atop the leaderboard at the RSM Classic, even if only by one shot over PGA Tour rookie Cameron Champ and part-time insurance salesman Jason Gore.\n\n\"I have a chance to win the tournament, and I'd have taken that Thursday morning,\" Howell said.\n\nHe was at 16-under 194.\n\nChamp ran off four straight birdies around the turn and shot 4-under 66. A winner at the Sanderson Farms Championship in Mississippi last month, this is the 12th time in his last 15 rounds Champ has been in the top 10. Gore, who only a few weeks ago became certified to sell insurance in California, overcame a missed tap-in at the turn with three birdies and an 18-foot eagle putt over his next six holes and shot 66.\n\nAny three of them holding the trophy Sunday would be an ideal way for the PGA Tour to end the calendar year.\n\nChamp gets attention with his sheer power. His club head speed (nearly 130 mph) and ball speed (just over 192 mph) are numbers not seen on the PGA Tour, and he is going for his second victory in five starts as a rookie.\n\n\"I'm rolling the ball the best I ever had, and I'm also hitting quality shots,\" Champ said. \"So I know I'm going to have enough looks throughout the round.\"\n\nGore only received a sponsor exemption Sunday evening when he was headed to Pebble Beach for an unofficial event. The 44-year-old had to think about accepting it because he hasn't played in three months, and he hasn't played the weekend on the PGA Tour since July 2017.\n\nBeing away from golf makes it fun. He steps up to the ball and hits the shot, just like playing with clients. Being in the hunt is hard to believe.\n\nWhat will Sunday bring?\n\n\"I don't really care, to be honest with you,\" Gore said. \"What am I going to do tomorrow? I'm going to show up. I'm going to put the tee in the ground and I'm going to hit it. I wish I could give you some profound answer, but that's really all I've got. It's not going to change my life. Well, it could change my life, but I'm not going to look at it that way, how about that?\"\n\nThe winner gets an invitation to the Masters, especially meaningful to Howell, who grew up in Augusta.\n\nHis last victory was at Riviera in 2007, and the last time Howell had at least a share of the 54-hole lead was 10 years ago at Turning Stone, a tournament that no longer exists. Howell has not won in any of his previous five times atop the leaderboard going into the final round.\n\nWebb Simpson had a 63 and was two shots behind, along with Ryan Blaum (65). Ten players are within five shots of the lead, a list that includes Sea Island resident Zach Johnson, who had a 65.\n\nThat was the size of Howell's lead over the field when he had two birdies through three holes, and even after his first bogey of the tournament when he went just over the back of the green at No. 4. But he recovered with a pair of birdies, made the turn in 32 and had a four-shot lead over Champ.\n\nAnd then it was steady golf the rest of the way as Champ and Gore, along with Simpson and others, closed the gap.\n\n\"I didn't finish off with much of anything,\" Howell said. \"I knew the guys would make birdies and close the gap if I didn't get going, and that's what happened.\"\n\nHe was asked whose place he would take in the final group, a 23-year-old rookie who won a month ago or a 44-year-old who considers himself a part-time player.\n\n\"I'll be a disgruntled 39-year-old right in the middle,\" Howell said with a laugh.\n\nIt was hard for him not to be impressed with Champ, who mainly hit his strong 3-iron off the tee and continued to show poise for his limited experience.\n\n\"I've never seen an iron hit as hard as he hits it. Holy cow,\" Howell said. \"I played a lot of golf with Tiger from 2000 through '08. I've not seen a guy hit a golf ball this hard ever that played professional golf. This guy's got a hell of a future.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Lexi Thompson has control of the CME Group Tour Championship, and Ariya Jutanugarn is in control of just about everything else.\n\nThompson's 4-under 68 on Saturday pushed her to 16 under after three rounds of the LPGA's season-ending event. She moved three shots clear of Nelly Korda and six ahead of Carlota Ciganda at Tiburon Golf Club. Korda shot her second consecutive 67 to get to 13 under, and Ciganda grinded out a 69 to get to 10 under for the week.\n\nThompson has been nearly flawless this week. Her only dropped shot of the tournament came Saturday when she made bogey at the par-4 fourth hole, then put together five birdies over the rest of her round.\n\n\"Golf is all about momentum,\" Thompson said.\n\nRight now, she has an abundance of that going for her. For the week, she has 14 birdies, one eagle and the one bogey. She's been calm and collected with her newly purchased Havanese Poodle around this week, finding a rhythm with an old putter and having her brother Curtis as her caddie.\n\n\"I just tried to keep the same attitude as I did the last two days,\" Thompson said. \"Curtis kept me nice and relaxed. He's always cracking jokes out there. It's been a nice relaxing week just having him on the bag and having all my family and friends out here supporting me.\"\n\nIf Thompson hangs on Sunday, she'll have her first win of the season.\n\nIf Jutanugarn keeps things together, she'll leave with plenty of prizes as well.\n\nJutanugarn will start her final round 10 shots back but leading the projected Race to the CME Globe standings and in position to claim the $1 million bonus for winning the LPGA's season-long points race \u2014 which would be her second in three years. Jutanugarn already has clinched player of the year and is nearly mathematically assured of winning the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average on tour.\n\n\"I did a pretty good job. I didn't think about that at all,\" Jutanugarn said of the Globe race and what's at stake this weekend. \"Yesterday I (thought) about that too much, worrying about that.\"\n\nThe Vare Trophy isn't hers yet, but it would take the most improbable of outcomes for that to slip away from Jutanugarn in the final round of the season. The two closest players to Jutanugarn in the season scoring standings are Minjee Lee and Jin Young Ko; either of them would have to beat the world's No. 1 player by about 30 strokes on Sunday to pass her in the Vare race.\n\nKorda had an eventful day with more birdies than pars \u2014 8-7 \u2014 but with three bogeys as well. So Yeon Ru (69 for the third straight day) and Marina Alex (71) are tied for fourth at 9 under, and Lydia Ko shot a bogey-free 68 on Saturday to move into a tie for sixth at 8 under with Brittany Lincicome (73).\n\nFirst-round leader Amy Olson made three double-bogeys on her way to a 76, leaving her in a tie for 16th and 11 shots off Thompson's lead.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The 72 total points were the most ever in The Game between two of the nation's oldest and most prestigious academic powerhouses, surpassing the 33-31 Yale victory in 1993.\n\nYale (5-5, 3-4) had beaten Harvard in back-to-back years, but the Crimson have now won 15 of the last 18 matchups.\n\n\"It was a pretty amazing opportunity to play this, just a historic game here with this incredible tradition and rivalry we have between Yale and Harvard,\" Bulldogs coach Tony Reno said. \"We weren't able to continue to match points.\"\n\nStewart, a senior playing his last game, left on a stretcher after getting hit as he dropped into a slide on the temporary sod about where the Red Sox shortstop would stand. As doctors attended to him, players on both teams kneeled; Yale quarterback Griffin O'Connor made the sign of the cross.\n\nThe sold-out crowd acknowledged Stewart when he was wheeled off. The school announced after the game that it was a right hip injury and Stewart was expected to make a full recovery.\n\n\"Heartbreaking for that to happen that late in the game, that late in his career,\" said Harvard coach Tim Murphy, who is now 18-7 in The Game.\n\nBackup quarterback Jake Smith came in and handed off to Devin Darrington on the next play for a 16-yard touchdown that gave the Crimson (6-3, 4-3 Ivy League) a 45-27 lead.\n\nDarrington ran for 91 yards and two scores and had another negated by a taunting penalty when he wagged his finger at a defender. Tyler Adams ran for 125 yards on just five carries for Harvard, including a 62-yard touchdown in the second quarter.\n\nO'Connor completed 23 of 48 passes for 328 yards. JP Shohfi had seven catches for 127 yards, including a 16-yard touchdown reception. Reed Klubnik had five catches for 91 yards and set Yale's single-season record with 1,143 receiving yards in his career.\n\nWith dozens of players from 1968 game watching, the schools traded touchdowns through most of the first three quarters \u2014 tying it at 7-7, 14-14 and 21-21 \u2014 before Yale took its first lead of the game on a field goal early in the second half.\n\nStewart's 15-yard pass to Jack Cook gave Harvard a 28-24 lead with 5 minutes left in the third, then another Yale field goal cut the deficit to one point.\n\nIn the fourth, Darrington went up the middle for a 27-yard score, but he wagged a finger as he outran a defender toward the goal line and was called for taunting. The touchdown negated, Harvard settled for a field goal.\n\n\"The bottom line is: He was wrong,\" Murphy said. \"He was wrong. It's that simple. It was the right call; he was wrong. I'm just so grateful to our team that he didn't have to learn that the absolute hard way of trying to live with that for a year or however many years.\"\n\nOn the Crimson's next possession, Darrington again broke loose, gaining 27 yards to the 6. Two plays later, he took it in from the 4 to give Harvard a 37-27 lead.\n\nOFF TARGET\n\nYale trailed 21-14 when O'Connor connected with Klubnik for a 48-yard gain to the 2. But Dudek was slammed down in the backfield for a loss of 6, and then a pass fell incomplete.\n\nOn third down, O'Connor found Dudek at the 3 and he was immediately hit by cornerback Wesley Ogsbury, whose head snapped back on contact. The officials threw a flag for targeting, the call was confirmed on replay and Ogsbury was ejected.\n\nThe teams \u2014 sharing the sideline because of the baseball stadium's configuration \u2014 began shouting at each other until coaches stepped between them. With a new set of downs, O'Connor ran it in on second down to tie the score 21-21.\n\nHALLOWED TURF\n\nThe band played \"Sweet Caroline\" early in the fourth quarter in keeping with Red Sox tradition at Fenway, which has hosted college football periodically since it opened in 1912. It was also the home of the American Football League's Boston Patriots in the 1960s; it has recently hosted Boston College games against Notre Dame and UConn.\n\nThe field barely fit inside the ballpark, even with the bullpens removed. Both teams shared the sideline on the Green Monster side of the field; the scoreboard on the wall was repurposed, with the innings replaced by quarters.\n\nMembers of the grounds crew were patching divots in the turf during most breaks, and a chunk came up on Stewart's slide.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Ivy League season is over, and the schools do not play in the FCS postseason. The Fenway field will be scrubbed of the football markings for an Irish hurling tournament, the Fenway Hurling Classic.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Once the Irish got that under control, they started to pull away for another lopsided victory.\n\nJackie Young had 28 points and 12 rebounds, Arike Ogunbowale scored 24 and Notre Dame beat No. 15 DePaul 101-77 on Saturday.\n\nThe defending NCAA champions passed their first big test and gave coach Muffet McGraw her 891st career victory. The Irish (3-0) went from trailing by seven after the first quarter to leading by seven at halftime before turning this into a rout.\n\n\"It was a little bit hard for us to get into any kind of offensive rhythm,\" McGraw said. \"It took us a little while to figure out how to get the ball inside.\"\n\nYoung finished four points shy of her career high. The junior made 11 of 12 free throws, though she and Ogunbowale each committed five turnovers.\n\nOgunbowale also shot 7 of 8 from the foul line. Jessica Shepard added 15 points and 16 rebounds, and Danielle Patterson scored 14.\n\nThe Irish dominated on the glass 48-23, outscored DePaul 58-26 in the paint and came away with the win despite committing 25 turnovers \u2014 10 in the first quarter.\n\n\"That's something we should be able to do every game,\" McGraw said, referring to the big rebounding edge. \"We have a really, really good team. ... We're bigger. And I felt we had a great effort on the offensive glass, too.\"\n\nAshton Millender led the Blue Demons (1-1) with 27 points, matching a career high she set exactly one year earlier against Delaware State. The senior made 7 of 12 3-pointers.\n\nChante Stonewall added a personal-best 21 points. But the Blue Demons got overwhelmed after a promising start.\n\n\"There's many, many coaches in the country that play very soft schedules at this point,\" DePaul coach Doug Bruno said. \"This is the Christmas season, it's the cupcake season. That's what people do at this time of the year. We don't.\"\n\nTAKING CONTROL\n\nYoung and Ogunbowale each scored 19 points and made all six free throws to help the Irish grab a 54-47 halftime lead after a sluggish start.\n\nAfter struggling early in a 20-point win over Penn on Monday, Notre Dame trailed 29-22 through a fast-paced first quarter. Millender scored 13 in the first 10 minutes, nailing a 3 from the wing at the buzzer to give the Blue Demons a seven-point lead.\n\nDePaul was ahead 37-32 in the second when Ogunbowale hit two free throws to start a 10-0 run. A basket on the break and layup by Young put Notre Dame in front by one.\n\nOgunbowale scored in transition and Danielle Patterson finished the run with a put-back after a turnover by DePaul's Kelly Campbell, making it 42-37 with four minutes left in the half.\n\nNotre Dame got the lead up to 79-63 with 31 seconds left in the third when Shepard scored in the paint. DePaul got within 10 early in the fourth before the Irish pulled away.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNotre Dame: Once the Irish got the turnovers under control, they started dominating inside and were able to overcome another sluggish start. The schedule doesn't get any easier, with a loaded field next week in the Vancouver Showcase that includes 2017 NCAA champion South Carolina. After that, the Irish play Iowa on Nov. 29 and Connecticut on Dec. 2.\n\nDePaul: Bruno believes his team benefits down the line by playing a tough schedule in the early going. To that end, the Blue Demons visit Connecticut on Nov. 28.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNotre Dame: Plays Gonzaga at the Vancouver Showcase on Thursday.\n\nDePaul: Plays Princeton in the Cancun Challenge on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Tom Mihalek) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Anthony Cirelli saved the day for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nTampa Bay coughed up a four-goal lead, yet escaped with the win when Cirelli scored 1:47 into overtime to lift the Lightning to a 6-5 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday.\n\nCirelli outmuscled Wayne Simmonds to gain position in front of the net and beat Calvin Pickard with a top-shelf wrist shot. It was his fourth goal of the season.\n\n\"He's a pretty strong guy so he was battling pretty hard,\" Cirelli said. \"Luckily at that last second I kind of pulled it across my body and had a little bit of room to get a quick shot off and it went in.\"\n\nThe Lightning became the sixth team in NHL history to squander a four-goal lead in the third period and go on to win the game. Tampa Bay is the first to accomplish the feat since the Stars beat Carolina 6-5 on Dec. 8, 2015.\n\nTampa Bay opened a 5-1 lead 9:08 into the third on Brayden Point's fifth goal in two games. But Philadelphia rallied behind two goals by Travis Konecny and Simmonds tied it with 3:32 left in regulation, beating Louis Domingue while lying on his back.\n\n\"It was a weird game,\" Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. \"We were up 5-1 and I don't think the game felt like we were up 5-1. It started getting physical there, it kind of gave the crowd a little bit of life. Then they started getting breaks that they probably deserved, so from a coach's perspective, it's probably one you're not too happy with, but I'm sure the fans were pretty entertained.\"\n\nThe Lightning won for the sixth time in eight games. Adam Erne had a goal and two assists in his first career three-point game, and Point scored twice after he had a natural hat trick in Thursday's 4-3 victory at Pittsburgh.\n\nJames van Riemsdyk had a goal and two assists for Philadelphia, which has dropped three in a row. Sean Couturier had a goal and an assist, and Pickard had 20 stops while subbing for the injured Brian Elliott.\n\nTampa Bay jumped in front with three goals in the second after a scoreless first period. Erne scored a power-play goal on a slick give-and-go play with Yanni Gourde at 6:02. Cedric Paquette and Point also scored to make it 3-1 heading into the third.\n\nVan Riemsdyk got Philadelphia on the board on the power play. The Flyers finished with three power-play goals after they scored three times with the man advantage in their previous 15 games.\n\nIt was van Riemsdyk's first goal since he signed with Philly in free agency, returning to the organization that drafted him after spending six seasons in Toronto. He recently returned to the lineup after missing six weeks with a knee injury.\n\nErne also set up Paquette's goal with a deft backhand pass. Erne has a career-best seven points this season after beginning the year with six goals and an assist in 49 career NHL games.\n\nTyler Johnson and Point scored in the third before Philadelphia battled back. The Flyers' rally began with power-play goals by Konecny and Couturier. Konecny scored again before Simmonds' eighth of the season capped the outburst of four goals in 6:04.\n\nClaude Giroux and Shayne Gostisbehere each had two assists for the Flyers. It was the ninth multipoint game for Giroux in Philadelphia's first 20 games.\n\n\"I mean we got a point out of it,\" Gostisbehere said. \"I don't know if we had any business getting a point tonight, but you know it shows the true grit of our team.\"\n\nNOTES: The Lightning have scored seven times in their last 11 power-play opportunities. ... Point has 14 goals and 24 points this season. ... Giroux picked up an assist on van Riemsdyk's goal for his 700th career point. He is the 237th player in NHL history to reach the total. ... Van Riemsdyk played in his 200th career game as a Flyer. The first 196 came between 2009-2012. ... The Flyers, who had four goals in a 6:04 span, became the ninth team in NHL history to come back from a four-goal deficit in the final 10 minutes of regulation to tie a game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLightning: Head into Nashville for a clash with the Predators in a matchup of two of the NHL's top teams this season.\n\nFlyers: Visit the Buffalo Sabres on Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Dylan Larkin and the Detroit Red Wings are gaining confidence with each win.\n\nRallying on the road sure helps.\n\nLarkin scored 4:09 into overtime, Jonathan Bernier stopped 38 shots and the Red Wings beat the New Jersey Devils 3-2 on Saturday.\n\nLarkin got his eighth goal of the season when he converted a 2-on-1 break with Anthony Mantha. It was Detroit's fifth victory in its last six games.\n\n\"It's awesome and feels good coming in here after games and we've come back from behind, finding ways to win instead of last year, when it was going the opposite way,\" Larkin said. \"Seems like now it's a different way every time.\"\n\nLuke Glendening and Michael Rasmussen also scored for the Red Wings.\n\nNew Jersey had won two in a row. Pavel Zacha and Blake Coleman scored for the Devils, and Keith Kinkaid made 28 saves.\n\nThe Devils dominated the opening period, outshooting the Red Wings 15-4 and taking the lead on Zacha's first goal of the season at 11:35. Zacha dropped to one knee to snare a cross-the-slot pass from Jesper Bratt and drive a one-timer by Bernier.\n\nThe 21-year-old Zacha, the No. 6 pick in the 2015 draft, was sent to the minors earlier this month, with the goal of improving his shot selection and net presence.\n\n\"It was one of the things they wanted me to work on,\" Zacha said. \"When you play with the players I play with, they are always trying to find you. It could help me a lot to score more goals, and help the team.\"\n\nIt was a tough opening period for the Red Wings, who lost Darren Helm to an upper-body injury when he was checked along the boards in the New Jersey end.\n\nDetroit played better at the start of the second and generated several good chances. Kinkaid denied Larkin on a prime scoring opportunity, and Trevor Daley hit the post.\n\nBut New Jersey opened a 2-0 lead when Coleman scored the Devils' first short-handed goal of the season at 15:53.\n\nThe Red Wings finally got on the board when Glendening flicked a quick shot from the left circle past a screened Kinkaid with 1:34 left in the period.\n\nIn the third, Rasmussen tied it at 2 on a deflection of Mike Green's point shot at 13:37. The Devils unsuccessfully challenged the goal, claiming goaltender interference.\n\nThe momentum had clearly shifted, and so had the confidence level of the Red Wings.\n\n\"Confidence is the biggest factor to success in the NHL today because of how close every team is, and how close every player is,\" Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill said. \"I can't say that enough times. I don't know if it's understood totally from the outside, but it's the biggest factor. As you win, you gain confidence and certainly gain some swagger.\"\n\nNow it's the Devils who could use some swagger after a strong start turned into a disappointing home loss, dropping their record to 3-6-1 in the last 10 games.\n\n\"The majority of the game we did some things we wanted to do,\" Devils coach John Hynes said. \"At the end of the day, we made some mistakes and they wound up in our net.\"\n\nNOTES: Tyler Bertuzzi assisted on each of Detroit's goals in regulation. ... The Devils placed D Sami Vatanen (lower body) on injured reserve. D Eric Gryba was recalled from the minors, and Egor Yakovlev replaced Vatanen in the lineup. ...

(AP) \u2014 North Carolina State big man Wyatt Walker figures the Wolfpack's start has been about \"playing against the game of basketball\" to prepare the team for tougher games ahead.\n\nThat's probably the only way to look at it, considering the overmatched opponents on the schedule so far are doing little to make the Wolfpack even a little uncomfortable.\n\nTorin Dorn scored 15 points to help N.C. State beat Maine 82-63 on Saturday, a lower-scoring output and victory margin from recent romps but another easy win nonetheless.\n\nC.J. Bryce added 14 points for the Wolfpack (4-0), who had outscored the first three opponents 300-153. On Saturday, N.C. State scored the game's first 15 points and maintained a comfortable margin the rest of the afternoon, leading 48-24 at the break.\n\nAnd it begs the question: Are these easy wins doing much to prepare the Wolfpack for games such as a Nov. 27 trip to Wisconsin in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge and a December visit from ninth-ranked Auburn?\n\n\"It's hard to tell right now,\" Bryce said. \"We're not really playing against our opponent right now. We're trying to look at it as we're playing against Duke, playing against (North) Carolina, playing against the bigger schools, and not really playing down to our competition.\"\n\nThat's where Walker's assessment comes in.\n\n\"We're always playing against ourselves, playing against the game of basketball,\" the graduate transfer from Samford said. \"You do have an opponent up there and a score and stuff like that, but there's things you can do.\n\n\"If you're winning, up by 30 or 40 points, and you're getting beat on backdoor cuts or you're giving up offensive rebounds, those translate into a game where you might be tied or down some.\"\n\nAndrew Fleming scored 19 points to lead the Black Bears (0-4), who had 18 turnovers that led to 27 points for the Wolfpack.\n\n\"The start to the game was one of the things we've got to get a lot better at,\" Maine coach Richard Barron said. \"I don't think we were executing our gameplan very well starting out. We also missed some shots, they hit some and those things against a good team can snowball on you pretty fast.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMaine: The America East program is in six-game road stretch to open the season, and had lost by 13 at Denver, 14 at Utah and 43 at San Francisco entering this game. The good news Saturday was that, after falling in the quick 15-0 hole, the Black Bears played relatively even the rest of the afternoon. And Maine shot 64 percent after halftime to finish at 55 percent for the game.\n\nN.C. State: The victory margins sure look nice. N.C. State beat Mount St. Mary's by 50 points in the opener, then beat Maryland-Eastern Shore by 46 and finally UNC Asheville by 51 on Tuesday night. Throw in Maine, and the Wolfpack's first four opponents entered Saturday with an average national rank of No. 322.25 according to KenPom.\n\nLOOKING GOOD\n\nN.C. State's Markell Johnson also scored 13 points and showed no ill effects after being helped off the court following a hard blindside backcourt pick early in Tuesday's win against UNC Asheville.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida had more on its mind than just running up a big score against Idaho.\n\nSure the 63-10 final score didn't hurt the No. 15 Gators' bid for a spot in a New Year's Six bowl game, but there was even more than that at stake. This was a game about the future,\n\nWith a win all but assured against an overmatched Idaho team when the Gators raced to a four-touchdown lead in the opening quarter, Florida turned its attention to some talented freshmen. Headlining the list was quarterback Emory Jones, currently serving as backup to starter Feleipe Franks.\n\nJones had played in two previous games this year and while Florida coaches want to add to his playing experience, they also are mindful of protecting his redshirt status of playing no more than four games this year. Jones saw extensive action on Saturday against Idaho and showed he'll be a contender with\n\nFranks for the starting job next year. He completed 12 of 16 passes for 125 yards and two touchdowns and guided the Gators to their final three scores.\n\nThat brought a nod of approval from Gators coach Dan Mullen.\n\n\"I thought he did pretty good. Missed a couple things. Some great little leadership things with him,\" Mullen said. \"There's a lot he can build off from this game. I didn't see any bad decisions really with where he went with the ball.\"\n\nFreshman running back Dameon Pierce has played in all 11 games this year and now has 410 rushing yards in 60 carries after his team-leading 77-yard performance against the Vandals. He also liked what he saw from Jones.\n\n\"He's come a long way as leader and taking that leadership role on the field,\" Pierce said. \"With him being one of my best friends, it's a great vibe together in the backfield. Emory is a calm, cool and collected guy and he's going to make plays. He handles adversity and plays like nothing happened.\"\n\nTwo other freshmen running backs made their second appearance of the year. Iverson Clement and Issac Ricks both had just one carry in their lone appearance before Saturday. Clement added to his total with three carries for 12 yards while Ricks had a 4-yard gain on his only carry.\n\nYet another freshman who looks to have a bright future with the Gators in the next three years is tight end Kyle Pitts. The 6-foot-6, 246-pounder has played in all but two games this year and has a pair of catches for 21 yards. He easily exceeded that total on his only catch against Idaho when he hauled in a 52-yard pass from Franks for his first collegiate touchdown.\n\nMullen likes the flexibility that Pitts brings to the offense.\n\n\"We played him flexed out an awful lot and he's going to be a mismatch problem for people as he continues to grow because he gives you the opportunity to be in different personnel groupings in the same personnel grouping,\" Mullen said. \"Is he a tight end? Is he a receiver? As he continues to grow and learn every aspect of the offense (he) becomes a mismatch problem for people.\"\n\nWith the NCAA's new redshirt rule allowing freshmen to play up to four games and still preserve a redshirt season, Jones can play in one more Florida game (Florida State next week or the Gators' bowl game) while Clement and Ricks can play in both contests. All three will likely get extended playing time in those games as Florida coaches take a good look at what the future holds for the Gators.\n\nIdaho (4-7) avoided a shutout when Cade Coffee connected on a 38-yard field goal in the third quarter and on a 12-yard pass from Mason Petrino to Jeff Cotton with 1:47 left in the game.\n\n\"Obviously we got our butts kicked,\" Idaho coach Paul Petrino said. \"There were guys that gave great effort today, guys I think that will go back and watch the tape and be proud of themselves.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIdaho: It was a disappointing season for the Vandals who were a preseason pick to finish fourth (coaches) or fifth (media) in the Big Sky Conference. They were 0-6 in conference play, and were outscored by an average of 51.7 to 18.2.\n\nFlorida: The Gators likely would secure a spot in a New Year's Six bowl with a victory at Florida State next week. It would cap an impressive first season under coach Dan Mullen, who inherited a 4-7 team with holes on both sides of the ball.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nFlorida is unlikely to move up unless other teams ranked higher fall.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIdaho: Season complete. Hosts Western State Colorado on Sept. 5 in 2019 opener.\n\nFlorida: Plays next Saturday at rival Florida State, which has won five in a row in the series.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Both North Carolina State and Louisville entered Saturday needing an emotional pick-me-up. Louisville came out fast, while the Wolfpack came out on top.\n\nRyan Finley threw for 316 yards and a career-high four touchdowns as N.C. State cruised to a 52-10 victory over the Cardinals.\n\nThe Wolfpack (7-3, 4-3) came into Saturday having lost three of their last four. They rolled up 518 yards and 45 straight points on the Atlantic Coast Conference's second-worst defense that went through a coaching change less than a week ago.\n\nLouisville interim coach Lorenzo Ward made his debut after Bobby Petrino was fired Sunday. The Cardinals (2-9, 0-8) held N.C. State on the game's first drive, then marched 40 yards to take a 3-0 lead on a Blanton Creque 32-yard field goal. The Wolfpack, however, controlled the game from there.\n\nWolfpack coach Dave Doeren said he talked to his players about the Louisville situation and how the Cardinals would likely start.\n\n\"We talked about not beating us and making them beat them,\" Doeren said. \"We just had to just kind of weather their emotional storm really which they had. I think our players showed resiliency and toughness in this game.\"\n\nKelvin Harmon caught seven passes for 100 yards and a score. Reggie Gallaspy Jr. added two rushing touchdowns and caught a scoring pass from Finley. Gallaspy's 1-yard plunge with 56 seconds left in the first half capped a 13-play, 80-yard drive and made it 17-3.\n\nN.C. State then took advantage of two short fields on its first three drives of the second half to extend the lead to 31-3 with 9:10 left in the third quarter.\n\nFinley, who completed 26 of 36 passes, said they knew Louisville would come out differently than how they showed on film.\n\n\"I think a team like that is dangerous,\" he said. \"But at the same time, if you jump out on them early and get into a rhythm like we did, it was going to be tough on them. We knew the situation. We just had to come down here and play our game.\"\n\nIt marked the fourth straight game, and sixth this season, the Cardinals gave up 50 or more points.\n\nFINLEY RISES\n\nWith the performance, Finley rose to second on the school's all-time yards passing list, trailing only Philip Rivers' 13,484 yards. At 9,757 yards, he has a chance for 10,000 yards with up to three games remaining.\n\nDoeren said that shows his graduate quarterback is special.\n\n\"He knows who he is,\" Doeren said. \"He incredibly competitive, he wants to play better. He works on the things he needs to get better at. He's great with his teammates. He's an inspirational guy.\"\n\nPASS OUT\n\nJust before the game, Louisville announced that starting quarterback Jawon Pass would sit out the first quarter \"for missing a team obligation.\" Ward ended up keeping his sophomore off the field until 11:03 remained in the third quarter. As a result, redshirt freshman Malik Cunningham got his second start of the season.\n\nWard said he kept Pass out because Cunningham played well in the first half.\n\nCunningham ran 14 times for 100 yards and a touchdown but left the game for good late in the fourth quarter with an apparent hand injury.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNorth Carolina State: After letting a 10-point lead slip away late against Wake Forest nine days ago, the Wolfpack came out Saturday with a much improved effort from its offense. Rather than settle for field goals, like they did against the Demon Deacons, the Wolfpack cashed in touchdowns on six of the seven drives that reached the red zone.\n\nLouisville: The beginning of the Ward era saw a more inspired effort by the team initially, but bad fundamentals continued to haunt the Cardinals. The defense had 12 men on the field for a third-and-7 play at the Wolfpack 28. Eight plays later, N.C. State scored its first touchdown. On offense, the Cardinals had a second-quarter drive where they got to the Wolfpack 13. However, two false starts and a holding penalty thwarted the drive, which ended with a 36-yard missed field goal try. The wheels fell off in the second half.\n\n\"Both sides of the ball, we started good,\" Ward said. \"We just shot ourselves in the foot with penalties.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNorth Carolina State: The Wolfpack make the short trip to Chapel Hill next Saturday to play North Carolina.\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals conclude their season next Saturday with a home game against their archrival, No. 20 Kentucky.\n\n___\n\nhttps://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It is the first game between the teams since the accident. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Conditions weren't optimal for Barret Pickering.\n\nThe Nebraska freshman had never kicked in the snow before, and the intensity was picking up as he was getting set to try a season-long 47-yard field goal with a swirling north wind at his back and a feel-like temperature of 15 degrees.\n\nThe ball off his foot started left and faded right \u2014 right between the goal posts for his third field goal of the fourth quarter and the go-ahead score in a 9-6 win over Michigan State on Saturday.\n\n\"We went out there like we do for any other kick,\" the native of Birmingham, Alabama said. \"We cleared off the ground to make sure we get a good ball off. Played a little bit of wind and hoped it would go in. It was a little cold out there. I'm not going to lie. It was a pretty strong wind out there. Not the easiest thing. The ground's frozen.\"\n\nIt was the first time the Cornhuskers had won a game without scoring a touchdown since a 3-0 victory over Kansas State in 1937, according to Nebraska sports information officials.\n\n\"Every week I've been coaching them there's a little more fight. Today's the most I've seen,\" said first-year Huskers coach Scott Frost, whose team has won four of five after an 0-6 start. \"That's a hard game to win. Even harder to lose. Our guys had to keep grinding, and the defense had to keep coming up with stops.\"\n\nThe Spartans (6-5, 4-4 Big Ten) got field goals of 34 and 26 yards from Matt Coghlin but were unable to sustain offense against a Nebraska defense that has struggled most of the season.\n\nNebraska (4-7, 3-5) tied it at 6-all on Pickering field goals of 36 and 20 yards before he hit the winner with 5:13 left.\n\nThe Spartans lost their chance for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter when Matt Dotson dropped a pass in the back of the end zone, and they ended up settling for Coghlin's second field goal.\n\nNebraska safety Antonio Reed came up big on two straight series to help set up the tying and winning field goals. He separated Rocky Lombardi from the ball with a jarring sack, and defensive lineman Damion Daniels recovered at the Michigan State 20. Next, Reed and Dedrick Young knocked the ball out of Dotson's hands for an incomplete pass to force a punt. Nebraska ran six plays before Pickering connected for the third time.\n\n\"We had too many drops,\" Spartans coach Mark Dantonio said. \"If you've got to point to one thing in the football game, it would be the dropped passes. I thought Lombardi played pretty well. At the end of the day, you've got to put the ball in the end zone in the red zone.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMichigan State: The injury-plagued Spartans are a mess offensively. They gained 289 total yards, but between dropped passes and big stops by the Nebraska defense, they couldn't sustain any drives.\n\n\"I'm frustrated about points. There's an execution factor here. You've got to score points. That's all inclusive,\" Dantonio said. \"We're playing good enough defense to win.\"\n\nNebraska: The Huskers' defense has given up a lot of yards and points this year, but they played their best game of the season.\n\n\"That's what we've been searching for as a defense all year, a complete game,\" linebacker Luke Gifford said. \"We got the stops when we needed them, got a couple takeaways. It was huge.\"\n\nNUMBERS TO NOTE\n\nNebraska, which had gone over 450 total yards in seven straight games, generated just 248. Devine Ozigbo ran 18 times for 74 yards to become the first Nebraska player since 2014 to go over 1,000 for the season. ... Stanley Morgan caught four passes to become the school's career leader in receptions with 182. ... Lombardi, starting in place of the injured Brian Lewerke for the second time in four games, completed just 15 of 41 passes. ... MSU's Connor Heyward rushed 21 times for 80 yards and caught five passes for 78.\n\nFOLTZ-SADLER CEREMONY\n\nFrost and Dantonio met at midfield with the parents of former punters Sam Foltz of Nebraska and Mike Sadler of Michigan State. The two died in a car accident in Wisconsin in July 2016. The coaches made a presentation to the families.\n\n\"I'd like to mention the Sadlers and the Foltzes. Today was about them,\" Pickering said. \"This is a game for them. And definitely I would like to thank my performance to Mike and Sam out there. It means a lot I go out there and represent them well.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMichigan State hosts Rutgers on Saturday.\n\nNebraska visits Iowa on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Fortunately for the Horned Frogs, they still had speedy playmaker Jalen Reagor on the field.\n\nReagor turned a screen pass into a 65-yard score and later had a 37-yard touchdown on a fourth-and-1 reverse run as the injury-plagued Frogs beat Baylor 16-9 on Saturday, keeping the Bears from reaching bowl eligibility in their home finale.\n\n\"The way season has gone, I have to do things like this,\" Reagor said. \"When those injuries happened, I thought, all right, I've got to empty the tank more.\"\n\nReagor got the go-ahead score with 2 minutes left in the third quarter when third-string running back Emari Demercado took a direct snap. TCU's last healthy scholarship running back started right and then flipped to Reagor sweeping the other way. Reagor had a wide-open lane to the end zone.\n\nTCU (5-6, 3-5 Big 12) can get to a bowl for the 16th time in coach Gary Patterson's 18 seasons with a win at home next Saturday night against Oklahoma State.\n\n\"That was a gutsy win,\" Patterson said. \"Want to know what kind of heart and what this program is about, you just need to watch that ball game. There wasn't any reason why we should have won.\"\n\nTCU fifth-year senior QB Grayson Muehlstein had completed only one pass in his seven career games before starter Michael Collins left the game with a right ankle injury late in the first quarter. That was just another injury in a long list for the Frogs, who have had at least 36 players miss much or all of the season.\n\nMuehlstein was 11-of-15 for 137 yards and the TD to Reagor, who matched a school record with a TD catch in six consecutive games.\n\n\"All I had to do was throw a quick little short pass, and he did all the rest,\" said Muehlstein, who admitted his heart rate accelerated a bit when he realized he was going into the game.\n\nReagor made the catch near the line of scrimmage, briefly reversed backward and then spun away from a defender. He sprinted down the left sideline for a 65-yard TD and a 9-6 lead upheld on a replay review after he almost got knocked out of bounds inside the 5.\n\nCharlie Brewer threw for 163 yards and had a 7-yard TD run when he leaped over one of his blockers for Baylor (5-6, 3-5). But Brewer also had one of the two Bears fumbles that led to TCU points.\n\n\"As I told our seniors I thought it was a game we had every opportunity to win,\" Bears coach Matt Rhule said. \"I know how badly our team wanted to win for our seniors and to be able to send them off the right way.\"\n\nBrewer's fumble recovered by Corey Bethley on the first play of the second quarter set up the Reagor TD catch. Brewer had ended the first quarter with consecutive runs of 15 and 11 yards, the first converting fourth-and-11.\n\n\"Just a miscue. Obviously something that can't happen,\" Brewer said of the fumble.\n\nBaylor running back John Lovett fumbled on the second play of the game, setting up Jonathan Song's 29-yard field goal.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nTCU: Muehlstein managed the game when forced into the action. Collins made his fourth start since Shawn Robinson's shoulder injury that needed surgery. Collins wasn't putting any pressure on his right foot and Patterson said he's probably doubtful next week.\n\nBaylor: While the Bears still have another chance to get bowl eligible, they really wanted to get that done in the home finale for 10 fifth-year seniors who remained through a sexual assault scandal that rocked the school more than two years ago, and led to only one win in Rhule's debut last season.\n\n\"Heartbreaking honestly,\" Bears senior right tackle Patrick Lawrence said. \"Me and my first class played the first game in McLane (Stadium), and just really would have been a storybook ending to go get it done against TCU.\"\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nThe Bears blocked a punt in the first quarter, and blocked the extra point after Reagor's TD screen play. The seven blocked kicks this season match Baylor's 1984 total for the third-most in school history. The record is 13 in 1980. ... TCU defensive end Ben Banogu, a potential first-round NFL draft pick who returned for his senior season, had 10 tackles, including four tackles for loss and a sack.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTCU home vs. Oklahoma State.\n\nBaylor plays Texas Tech next Saturday at the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and the site of the Big 12 championship game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The school has one of the highest vaccination religious exemption rates in the state.\n\nThe viral infection manifests in an itchy rash in most cases and is not typically life-threatening. But the outbreak at Asheville Waldorf should cause concern, said Dr. Jennifer Mullendore of Buncombe County Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chickenpox is particularly dangerous to infants, pregnant women those with compromised immune systems, such as people who are HIV positive or coming out of cancer treatment.\n\n\"People don't think it's a serious disease, and for the majority of people it's not. But it's not that way for everybody,\" Mullendore said. Two to three out of every 1,000 children infected with chickenpox required care in a hospital, she said.\n\n\"To me, that's not a mild disease, and if you're the parent of one of those children, you probably don't think so either,\" Mullendore said.\n\nEach year, the chickenpox vaccine prevents more than 3.5 million cases of varicella, 9,000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths, the CDC states on its webpage.\n\nMore: Parents plan unsafe chickenpox party. One parent 'swamped with requests' to share disease\n\nMore: U.S. vaccine panel to discuss waning effectiveness, new shots\n\nThat's why health care providers for years have recommended all children medically able, namely those who have healthy immune systems, be vaccinated, Mullendore said.\n\nThose recommendations have by and large have gone unheeded by the parents of Asheville Waldorf's 152 students \u2014 110 of whom have not received the chickenpox vaccine, which was made available in the United States in 1995.\n\nLeading the state in vaccination exemption\n\nNorth Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services tracks the rate of kindergartners whose parents have claimed a religious exemption, allowing them to forego vaccination.\n\nDuring the 2017-2018 school year, the last for which data were available, Asheville Waldorf had a higher rate of religious exemptions for vaccination than all but two other schools in the state.\n\nOf the 28 kindergartners who enrolled that year, 19 had an exemption to at least one vaccination required by the state for school entry.\n\nSchool officials did respond to questions from the Citizen Times Friday. The school enrolls students from nursery age through sixth grade, Mullendore said.\n\nThe only two North Carolina schools to top Asheville Waldorf's religious exemption rate were private schools in other counties. Both had 100 percent exemption rate \u2014 one had only one kindergarten student, the other had two.\n\nDuring the same academic year, Buncombe County led the state in religious exemption rates for kindergartners with 5.7 percent.\n\n\"The thing people need to understand is that when you have pockets of unvaccinated people, they serve as reservoirs for disease,\" said Susan Sullivan, a nurse with the state DHHS who consults with local health departments about vaccines and preventable diseases.\n\n\"It's not just about you\"\n\nBuncombe County has long dealt with high vaccination exemption rates, in part from parents who fear vaccines more so than the illnesses they prevent.\n\n\"What's the big deal with chickenpox? There is no big deal,\" said Asheville resident Amy Gordon, whose children were vaccinated for polio and other diseases in the late 1980s, years before the chickenpox vaccine became available.\n\nMore: Arizona cancels vaccine program after backlash from parents who don't vaccinate\n\nMore: Parents have dangerous misconceptions about the flu vaccine\n\n\"If I was a parent with a kid who wasn't vaccinated, I'd want to send my kid to the Waldorf School to get chickenpox,\" Gordon said.\n\nHad the vaccine been around when her children got their other shots in the late 1980s, Gordon still wouldn't have allowed it, she said.\n\nIn the face of overwhelming agreement to the contrary from health care providers and government agencies, such as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Gordon and others say that vaccines lead to a host of health issues.\n\nFor Sullivan, and countless others in the medical field, the diseases that vaccines prevent are far more concerning, even when they may seem minor.\n\nIn the 1980s, Sullivan was working as a nurse in Johns Hopkins oncology unit when she witnessed chickenpox claim the life of an elementary-age girl.\n\nThe girl, who Sullivan didn't name, had just finished a leukemia treatment and returned to her home when she came in contact with somebody who had chickenpox.\n\n\"Because her immune system was brand spanking new, the disease spread to her internal organs, and she did not survive,\" Suillivan said. \"That was a wake up call to me that this is not a benign childhood illness.\"\n\nSullivan and Mullendore, echoing the position of healthcare providers at large, said that vaccination is important for protecting the community at large.\n\n\"It's not just about you,\" Sullivan said. \"It's about the people you interact with: Pregnant women, people with AIDS, people finishing chemo. They're a part of our community, too, and we have to do what we can to protect everybody.\"\n\nFollow Sam DeGrave on Twitter: @sgdegrave\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/17/school-chickenpox-outbreak-has-high-vaccination-exemption-rate/2038784002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump talks to CIA about Jamal Khashoggi killing", "description": "Trump talks to CIA about Khashoggi killing", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/17/jamal-khashoggi-killing-donald-trump-talks-cia-reporter-death/2039290002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.krem.com/assets/GANNETT/images/d1cf1870-c95b-4b9a-a81e-b1fe562da73c/d1cf1870-c95b-4b9a-a81e-b1fe562da73c_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T20:43:38Z", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump spoke on Saturday with his CIA chief and top diplomat about the spy agency\u2019s assessment of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Turkish and Saudi authorities say he was murdered inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom after he went there to get marriage documents.\n\nThe Saudis responded to the purported CIA assessment by calling it false and requesting proof of how the intelligence agency made the conclusions. The State Department, meanwhile, said in a statement to ABC News on Saturday that its assessment was not completed and reports that the United States had made \"a final conclusion are inaccurate.\"\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the president spoke of Saudi Arabia as \u201ca truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to take a lot of things into consideration\u201d when deciding what measures to take against the kingdom.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration announced sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the killing.\n\nBut the new assessment puts added pressure on Trump and Congress to move on harsher punishments against the regime, specifically when it comes to the crown prince.\n\nHere are a few options the United States could use to punish Saudi Arabia.\n\nMagnitsky sanctions\n\nThe Global Magnitsky Act allows in a provision that lawmakers can require the president to determine whether any person was complicit in Khashoggi's death.\n\nAlready, the U.S. has sanctioned 17 people in connection to Khashoggi's killing, but that list includes no one in the royal family.\n\nIn Congress, lawmakers said the U.S. sanctions on the 17 Saudis were a good first step but called on the Trump administration to go further.\n\nMore: US sanctions 17 Saudi nationals over Jamal Khashoggi's killing\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action does not put this issue to rest,\u201d said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cIt remains unclear whether the Trump Administration has determined who is responsible for this horrific incident.\u201d\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said he had \u201ca lot of concerns about the trajectory that Saudi Arabia is on right now, and I think a price needs to be paid.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Jamal Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, had messages for President Donald Trump and America in a video shown at his memorial service in Washington. USA TODAY\n\nThe sanctions take away visas and seize any U.S. assets. Lawmakers have the option to go over the president's head to sanction others connected to the killing.\n\nThis has happened before. In 2017, Congress passed sanctions against Russia due to election meddling in the 2016 election, a move the president wasn't fond of at the time.\n\nYemen conflict\n\nAnother option is for the United States to stop supporting Saudi Arabia in the conflict in Yemen.\n\nThe U.S. backing the Saudi regime has been marked by controversy as the death toll, including many children, continues to increase. The conflict has also led to widespread famine, leaving millions at risk of starving in Yemen.\n\nCongress has some options to cut off support. Lawmakers could request U.S. military personnel be withdrawn since the missions weren't OK'd by Congress.\n\nAlready, some lawmakers have hinted that they would take up measures preventing the U.S. from continuing to help Saudi Arabia in the effort, even before Khashoggi's killing.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., filed a bill in September that aimed to halt U.S. support in the Saudi-Yemen war, according to Roll Call. A new Democratic-controlled House could help the bill pass.\n\nSenators Todd Young, R-Ind. and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., told the New York Times it was time to end some of its support for Saudi Arabia, including its refueling missions, something the Trump administration ended earlier this month.\n\n\u201cIf the administration does not take immediate steps, including ending U.S. refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft, we are prepared to take additional action when the Senate comes back into session,\u201d the senators said in a statement.\n\nArms deal\n\nSince Khashoggi's killing, Trump has repeatedly said he does not want to nix $110 billion in U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia because it would hurt American companies and zap U.S. jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s a raw financial calculation \u2013 and experts say an inaccurate one \u2013 but the possible weapons sale has become a political flashpoint in the escalating debate over how to respond to Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in the Khashoggi case.\n\nWhether it goes through, or not, could have lasting consequences on the U.S.-Saudi relationship.\n\nMore: US weapons sales a flashpoint as President Trump presses Saudi Arabia over missing journalist\n\nDemocrats in Congress say canceling the arms sale would send a signal to the Saudi regime that it doesn\u2019t have carte blanche to murder journalists outsides its borders, particularly those who are American residents. Trump sees it differently.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the concept of stopping an investment of $110 billion into the United States,\u201d Trump said last week.\n\nThree Republicans and three Democrats introduced legislation this week that would suspend U.S. weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and impose mandatory sanctions on individuals responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nIt would also require the Trump administration to document human rights in Saudi Arabia and impose new accountability measures for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nSome say the Saudis could turn to another country as a diplomatic slap to the U.S. \u2013 and because money is not a real obstacle to the oil-rich country.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, Deirdre Shesgreen and the Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/17/jamal-khashoggi-killing-donald-trump-talks-cia-reporter-death/2039290002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Northwestern stays in stride with 24-14 win at Minnesota", "description": "Northwestern stays in stride with 24-14 win at Minnesota, a program-record 8th straight on road", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/17/northwestern-stays-in-stride-with-24-14-win-at-minnesota/38552477/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b4fd2685775c2c3d82f4566448d08ef35e6d7bb3/c=0-925-1973-2035/local/-/media/2018/11/17/USATODAY/usatsports/453259b1389449fba915e2cf1d963c9a.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T20:42:28Z", "content": "Northwestern running back Isaiah Bowser (25) celebrates with teammate wide receiver Trey Pugh after Bowser scored a touchdown against Minnesota during an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018, in Minneapolis.

(AP Photo/Stacy Bengs) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 When he was an assistant at Northern Illinois, Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck once cold-called Pat Fitzgerald for a lunch meeting to learn about being a head coach.\n\nA decade later, Fitzgerald and his Northwestern Wildcats are still teaching teams like the Gophers how to win in the Big Ten.\n\nIsaiah Bowser rushed for 85 yards and two touchdowns, and No. 24 Northwestern turned three turnovers by Minnesota quarterback Tanner Morgan into 10 points on the way to a 24-14 victory on Saturday that stretched its program-record road winning streak to eight games.\n\n\"The teams that win in our league are the teams that have the sustainability over the long period of time,\" Fleck said. \"You have to earn that, but they have that.\"\n\nClayton Thorson completed 15 of 21 passes for 230 yards without a turnover and had a 13-yard touchdown run in the first half for the Wildcats (7-4, 7-1, No. 22 CFP), who have their best Big Ten record since 1996 when Fitzgerald was in his final season as a player.\n\nNate Hall had two interceptions for the Wildcats, who have won 14 of their last 15 conference contests, including 11 games in a row against opponents within the West Division they clinched the week before. Hall, who also made the tackle on a fourth-and-1 stop of Seth Green at the Northwestern 26 in the second quarter, was ejected for targeting on a helmet-to-helmet hit on Morgan in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"A very businesslike championship-type approach to the week culminated with a very businesslike win,\" Fitzgerald said. \"I thought our guys were very focused.\"\n\nMohamed Ibrahim rushed for 98 yards and a touchdown and Blake Cashman had a sack among his career-high 20 tackles for the Gophers (5-6, 2-6), who fell to 4-13 in conference play under Fleck.\n\nWith a kickoff temperature of 23 degrees, which was actually slightly warmer than when Minnesota beat Purdue here last week , Thorson and the Wildcats played the field-position game well. The secondary missing three injured starters complemented a strong pass rush led by Joe Gaziano, who forced a fumble by Morgan with a sack in the fourth quarter, setting up a short field goal.\n\nThat came right after a 68-yard completion on third down from Thorson to J.J. Jefferson, who slipped past freshman safety Jordan Howden and was tackled at the 2 before Bowser's second score.\n\nMorgan finished 19 for 32 for 197 yards and a late touchdown pass to Tyler Johnson, who topped the 1,000-yard mark for the season. Minnesota's streak of four straight games with 400-plus total yards, the longest for the program in more than 12 years, was stopped.\n\n\"They're fighting for bowl eligibility. We knew we were going to get their best shot,\" Fitzgerald said. \"That's what jumps out to me so much about our defense.\"\n\nMONEY MAN\n\nCashman, a senior playing in his final home game, had a career performance. Fleck said he planned to have the team review all 20 of the former walk-on's tackles this week to be reminded of what full effort looks like.\n\n\"I'm very excited to see where this team goes,\" Cashman said, \"and one day I'll come back here and I think we'll see a lot of success.\"\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nAfter cracking The Associated Press Top 25 for the first time this season following last week's win at Iowa , Northwestern will remain a ranked team for now. The Wildcats aren't part of the College Football Playoff conversation, but to be headed for the Big Ten championship game in December after losing at home to Akron and starting the season 1-3 in September is quite an accomplishment.\n\nThe Gophers were actually favored by two points on the final betting lines.\n\n\"That was a joke,\" Fitzgerald said, adding: \"The level of respect for the guys in that locker room is not very high because of a couple games earlier in the year.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNorthwestern: Fitzgerald implored his team to maintain a \"pedal-down\" mentality despite the outcome of this game having no bearing on the Wildcats' bid to become Big Ten champions and reach the Rose Bowl. Right after the Gophers tied it with 2:18 left in the first half, they responded with authority. Kyric McGowan had a 39-yard kickoff return, and Thorson followed two straight completions with his untouched run into the end zone to take the lead for good.\n\n\"Our guys came in on Monday and were ready to go,\" Thorson said.\n\nMinnesota: With a freshman quarterback, limiting turnovers this season was bound to be one of the biggest challenges for the Gophers. They entered the week with a minus-6 margin that was the second-worst in the Big Ten.\n\n\"I've got to play better, 100 percent no question about it,\" Morgan said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNorthwestern: Hosts Illinois next Saturday.

(AP Photo/Bryan Woolston) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Mike Edwards' early takeaways helped stake Kentucky to its initial lead. Linebacker Josh Allen then made sure the 20th-ranked Wildcats held on with clutch sacks late.\n\nSeniors are expected to stand out in their home finales, and veterans certainly factored in a tenser-than-expected victory against Middle Tennessee.\n\nEdwards' two turnovers led to Kentucky's first two touchdowns, and the Wildcats overcame a second-half lull to make several fourth-quarter defensive stops and escape with a 34-23 win on Saturday.\n\nKentucky (8-3) ended a two-game slide but had to survive the Blue Raiders' rally within 31-23 early in the fourth. Allen, the Southeastern Conference's sacks leader, dropped Brent Stockstill for a 7-yard loss on fourth down and set up Miles Butler's 32-yard field goal with 4:01 remaining for an 11-point edge.\n\nA defensive facemask penalty helped the Blue Raiders (7-4) reach the Kentucky 5-yard line in the final minute before consecutive sacks of Stockstill by Allen and Jamar Watson totaling 16 yards ended their final chance. Allen had a career-high 15 tackles and two of Kentucky's seven sacks to become the Wildcats' single-season (13) and career sacks leader (27.5).\n\n\"I can't thank the linemen enough for doing their jobs and allowing me to have opportunities to make plays like that,\" Allen said.\n\nEdwards provided the initial defensive boost by returning an interception 66 yards for a TD 1:27 into the game. Then he stripped Zack Dobson of the ball on MTSU's next drive to set up Benny Snell Jr. for the first of his two TDs and a 31-10 cushion that Kentucky eventually needed to earn its eighth victory, its most in the regular season since 1984. The 2007 squad earned its eighth win in the Music City Bowl.\n\n\"I'm pleased to get the eighth victory, but (it was) definitely not easy,\" Kentucky coach Mark Stoops said. \"We knew it was going to be a tough, hard-fought game and they kind of beat us at our game. They kept the ball, possessed the ball the entire game and it kind of got a little aggravating.\"\n\nFortunately for Kentucky, seniors saved the game on a day when 16 of them were honored. And the contributions weren't limited to defense.\n\nTight end C.J. Conrad caught an 11-yard, second-quarter scoring pass from Terry Wilson on a play that seemed destined for a big loss of yardage. Wilson spun away from the pressure before rolling left and threading an off-balance pass through several defenders to Conrad in the back of the end zone for a 24-7 lead.\n\nStockstill completed 30 of 33 passes for 293 yards and three touchdowns and Chaton rushed for 98 yards and two scores. But those turnovers forced MTSU to play catch-up as its four-game winning streak ended.\n\n\"We didn't flinch,\" MTSU coach Rick Stockstill said. \"With six or seven minutes left in the game we made it a one-score game, and we couldn't finish it off.\"\n\nEMOTIONAL DEBUT\n\nSuiting up would've been rewarding enough for Kentucky sophomore defensive end Josh Paschal, who hadn't played this season while undergoing treatment for a malignant melanoma on the bottom of his foot. Paschal went on to record his first tackle with a third-down stop in the second quarter.\n\n\"It felt good just to wipe some dust off, it's been a while,\" said Paschal, who underwent three surgeries and is undergoing immunotherapy every four weeks.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nKentucky needed this win and should stay in the AP Top 25.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMiddle Tennessee: The Blue Raiders outgained Kentucky 392 yards to 324 and seemed poised to tie the game late, but couldn't break through deep in Wildcats territory. Those turnovers on their first two possessions dug a quick hole they couldn't quite escape. Stockstill became the NCAA's 25th player to reach 100 career TDs.\n\nKentucky: The Wildcats needed a lift, though it was tense. They finally surpassed 20 points for the first time since beating South Carolina 24-10 on Sept. 29. The offense and defense stalled, before Allen came up with stops that sealed the win.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMiddle Tennessee hosts UAB on Saturday in a matchup against Conference USA's West leader.\n\nKentucky visits Louisville on Saturday night in search of a nine-win season and second rivalry win in three seasons.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Army coach Jeff Monken breathed a sigh of relief after the Black Knights finished their second straight unbeaten season at home. Now, he has three weeks to prepare for archrival Navy.\n\nFullback Darnell Woolfolk rushed for three touchdowns, the 10th time in his career with multiple scores, and Kelvin Hopkins Jr. ran for another score as Army held off Championship Subdivision foe Colgate 28-14 on Saturday to snap the Raiders' 14-game winning streak.\n\nArmy (9-2), which just missed breaking into the AP Top 25 this week, has won seven in a row and 13 straight at Michie Stadium over two seasons. The last time the Black Knights accomplished back-to-back unbeaten seasons at home was in the mid-1980s.\n\n\"I think it's really important to win at home,\" Monken said. \"When we play here, we're going to be hard to beat. Credit to our guys. They have a good defense. They held us down. We didn't run as effectively as we normally do and we certainly didn't stop the run as well as we have this year.\"\n\nThis one wasn't so easy against the sixth-ranked Raiders, who had dominated in winning their first nine games with a stalwart, gang-tackling defense that had allowed only 29 points in nine games. That defense limited the second-ranked rushing team in the nation to 261 yards rushing, 46 below its average, as Army only outgained Colgate 286-251.\n\nRaiders tailback James Holland was a big part of that, rushing for 166 yards and averaging 9.2 yards per carry against the ninth-best run defense in the Bowl Subdivision. Army was allowing just under 100 yards a game. Holland's 10-yard TD run in the fourth quarter narrowed Army's lead to 21-14.\n\n\"That's a good football team,\" Monken said. \"I told our team it was going to be a battle. They made us earn every yard.\"\n\nArmy's triple option never gave the Raiders the chance to tie, keeping the ball for over 7 minutes. Woolfolk secured the victory with a 3-yard score with 2:06 left, his 37th career TD rushing to tie Mike Mayweather for third all-time at West Point.\n\n\"Our kids kept fighting,\" Colgate coach Dan Hunt said. \"They weren't playing, 'Oh, let's just hope they kill it at 21-14 so the score looks good. They were trying to get a stop and get the ball back. Army made a play when they had to. Hats off to them.\n\n\"We just couldn't get the stop. That's what they do.\"\n\nThe Raiders had not allowed a point in the first quarter all season. That changed the first time the Black Knights got the ball.\n\nAfter forcing Colgate into a three-and-out on the first possession of the game, Army drove 49 yards in eight plays. Hopkins had four carries for 37 yards, scoring on 3-yard run for a 7-0 lead midway through the first quarter.\n\n\"We talked about it all week. If we got out ahead, we've got to try to put it away,\" Woolfolk said. \"They've got a great defense. They fought back.\"\n\nThe Black Knights forced another punt and drove 76 yards in 16 plays to score again. Hopkins kept the drive going with a fourth-down conversion, Army's 30th in 33 tries, and Kell Walker's 10-yard gain off a pitch left set up Woolfolk's first touchdown.\n\nUnfazed by the step up on competition and playing with a senior quarterback making just his second career start, Colgate proved a stubborn foe. Raiders safety Alec Wisniewski slammed Hopkins on a run right, forcing a fumble that was scooped up by Tyler Castillo and returned 35 yards for a touchdown to cut Army's lead to 14-7 with 5:52 left in the third. It was the first lost fumble by the Army offense since the season opener at Duke.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nColgate: The Raiders excelled in a down year for the Patriot League. The other six teams behind Colgate were a combined 16-44 before Saturday and ranked at the bottom of the national statistics offensively. Still, the Raiders acquitted themselves well against Army and Holland is a real force in the backfield. He boosted his season total to 1,065 yards rushing with 12 TDs and likely will be an important factor in the NCAA playoffs.\n\nArmy: The Black Knights managed to hold off the Raiders and now have a nice respite to get healthy before the season finale against Navy.\n\nCLOSE BUT\n\nColgate held its own statistically in the first half despite trailing 14-0 at the break as Army outgained the Raiders just 138-128 and was helped by two big penalties. In the first quarter, a third-down reception by Owen Buscaglia gave the Raiders a first down at the Army 40, but it was nullified by a pass interference penalty, and later a 58-yard catch-and-run by Thomas Ives off a flanker screen was wiped out by a holding call.\n\nREMEMBERING BRANDON\n\nArmy honored 25 seniors in pregame ceremonies, including the late Brandon Jackson, who was killed in a single-car crash after a big home victory two years ago. Jackson's mother, Morna Davis, was on the field to represent him.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nColgate awaits the announcement of the NCAA FCS playoffs on Sunday.\n\nArmy has three weeks off until it meets archrival Navy in Philadelphia.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Trace McSorley became the winningest quarterback in Penn State history with a lot of help from his friends.\n\nMcSorley threw two touchdown passes to tight end Pat Freiermuth and No. 16 Penn State's defense set up two touchdowns with turnovers in a 20-7 victory over Rutgers on Saturday, sending the Scarlet Knights to their 10th straight loss.\n\n\"Kind of like today by no means was my best performance, but the team gutted out a win,\" said McSorley, who hit two milestones in the game. \"The defense played great, the special teams contributed when they needed to and our offense was able to put up enough points to get a win, so a lot of that is on the rest of the team, and in my eyes wins go to the team, not the person.\"\n\nThe win was No. 30 for McSorley as a starter, moving him into the top spot in school history ahead of Todd Blackledge (1980-82) and Tony Sacca (1988-91). The two touchdowns increased his total \u2014 running and passing \u2014 to 101, making him the third in Big Ten history to crack the century mark. Drew Brees of Purdue and J.T Barrett of Ohio State were the others.\n\n\"Being all-time leader in terms of wins is the most important stat you can have at the quarterback position,\" Penn State coach James Franklin said.\n\nMcSorley's touchdown passes covered 6 yards in the second quarter and 18 in the fourth as the Nittany Lions (8-3, 5-3 Big Ten, No. 14 CFP) beat Rutgers (1-10, 0-7) for the 12th straight time. Jake Pinegar added field goals of 22 and 19 yards.\n\nRaheem Blackshear, who ran for 102 yards on 22 carries, scored on a 2-yard fourth-quarter run for Rutgers to deny Penn State its first shutout in more than a season.\n\nThe dominant group for Penn State was its defense, which forced three turnovers, had four sacks and 11 tackles for losses and held Rutgers to 46 yards passing.\n\n\"We (are) one of the better defensive lines in the country and I believe we're one of the best in the Big Ten,\" said defensive end Shareef Miller, who had seven tackles, including a sack and 2\u00bd for losses.\n\nSafety Garrett Taylor intercepted a horrible pass by freshman Art Sitkowski late in the second quarter to give the Nittany Lions the ball at the Rutgers 28. Four plays later, McSorley (17 of 37 for 183 yards) found Freiermuth for a 10-3 lead with 2:04 left in the half.\n\nSenior Gio Rescigno replaced Sitkowski (3 of 7 for 18 yards and two interceptions) after the bad decision on the screen pass Penn State read from the start.\n\nA Daniel Joseph recovery of an Isaih Pacheco fumble at the Rutgers 46 late in the third quarter set up the second TD pass early in the fourth for a 20-0 lead.\n\n\"Our players played with a lot of fight and effort and toughness today,\" Rutgers coach Chris Ash said. \"It's what we needed to do to continue to try to close the gap, and our players did that. The game is about taking care of the football, and some missed opportunities. That was the difference in the game.\"\n\nThe Scarlet Knights should have scored in the third quarter. After moving 82 yards on 14 running plays, they ran a fourth-down flea flicker from the 2-yard line and a wide-open Rescigno dropped a soft pass from Trey Sneed, who had lined up outside and took a toss from Blackshear.\n\n\"I told the guys you give me a day to sulk to sulk about it and then you can grill me about it for the rest of the week,\" said Rescigno, who sparked the offense running for 36 yards on seven carries. \"It is what it is. It happened. I have to move on.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nThis was not an impressive performance by the Nittany Lions, who were hoping to move into a position for a possible New Year's Day bowl game. The offense never got going and the only reason it was no contest was the Penn State defense.\n\nThe Scarlet Knights are now facing the prospect of their first one-win season since going 1-11 in Greg Schiano's second season, in 2002. Rutgers was 0-11 in 1997, so this isn't rock bottom. The 10-game losing streak is the longest since losing 11 in a row over the end of the 1998-99 season.\n\nDISCIPLINE\n\nPenn State starting linebacker Cam Brown sat out first half for a \"small violation of team rules,\" Franklin said.\n\nHOT MIC\n\nReferee Mike Cannon left his microphone open after overturning a ruling on the field that gave Penn State a first down at the Rutgers 23 in the fourth quarter. The review moved the spot up a yard after a pass from McSorley to KJ Hamler. \"That was a tight one, Bruce,\" Cannon said to linesman Bruce Keeling.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPenn State: Plays host to Maryland next Saturday and then waits for a bowl bid.\n\nRutgers: Finishes season at Michigan State next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSTARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Nick Fitzgerald barreled through a defender during the fourth quarter, crashing face-first into the ground before trotting to the sideline while removing a huge clump of grass and mud from his helmet.\n\nTwo plays later, he was back on the field. And the quarterback's 19-yard pass to Austin Williams was a fitting way to end his time playing football at Davis Wade Stadium.\n\nFitzgerald threw four touchdown passes and ran for another score to lead No. 25 Mississippi State over Arkansas 52-6 on Saturday. In his final home game, the 6-foot-5, 230-pound Fitzgerald had one more big performance in a career full of them.\n\n\"He's a guy that's going to play 100 percent, 100 percent of the time,\" Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead said. \"This sounds cliche, but he's got a bulldog spirit and a bulldog toughness to him and that shows up every time he's between the white lines.\"\n\nFitzgerald completed 9 of 14 passes for 127 yards and ran for 85 yards, including a 2-yard touchdown. He now has 3,387 career rushing yards, extending his Southeastern Conference record for rushing yards by a quarterback.\n\nSenior Aeris Williams, starting in place of the injured Kylin Hill, added 104 yards rushing on 15 carries. Williams ran for more than 1,100 yards this season but has had a reduced role this season because of Hill's emergence as the lead running back.\n\nFitzgerald said having one more big game with Williams was special.\n\n\"To have a day like this with another senior, to go out there and have fun playing, putting up huge numbers in front of the home crowd for the last time, it was awesome,\" Fitzgerald said.\n\nMississippi State (7-4, 3-4 SEC, No. 21 CFP) pushed out to a 17-3 lead by halftime thanks to 166 yards rushing, including rushing touchdowns by Fitzgerald and Nick Gibson. The Bulldogs left no doubt about the outcome in the third quarter, scoring 21 points on three of Fitzgerald's touchdown passes.\n\nMississippi State's defense held Arkansas to just 219 total yards.\n\nArkansas (2-9, 0-7) had some promising drives in the first half but had to settle for field goals. That wasn't enough to keep pace with the Bulldogs, who methodically beat the Razorbacks for a sixth time in seven seasons.\n\n\"This is completely unacceptable,\" Arkansas coach Chad Morris said. \"Unacceptable in all areas. Unacceptable coaching, unacceptable playing, unacceptable at all levels. This is not what this program is about \u2014 not what it's going to be built on. We're in major gut check time.\"\n\nArkansas' Ty Storey completed 16 of 28 passes for 137 yards and one interception. Rakeem Boyd ran for 84 yards.\n\n\"I think it started heading downhill and just no one stepped up,\" Storey said. \"And that's as much on me as anyone.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nArkansas: After an acceptable first half, the second half proved embarrassing. Arkansas has shown flashes of improvement during Morris' first season, but this loss was a step back.\n\nMississippi State: The Bulldogs handled business against the worst team in the SEC. Mississippi State continues to excel on the ground and on defense. The passing game is still hit-and-miss, but Fitzgerald made good decisions, especially during the second half.\n\nAWESOME ABRAM\n\nMississippi State's defense was led by senior Johnathan Abram, who had 12 tackles, including 3\u00bd for a loss and 1\u00bd sacks. He leads the Bulldogs with 89 tackles this season.\n\nAbram has had to move from safety to the team's hybrid safety/linebacker position over the past few weeks because of an injury to Jaquarius Landrews. Despite the change, he's continued to thrive.\n\n\"It just shows I can play anywhere,\" Abram said. \"I get the chance to be around the ball a little more.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArkansas plays at Missouri on Friday.\n\nMississippi State plays at Ole Miss on Thanksgiving night.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) \u2014 No. 1 Alabama finally found a team that could play toe to toe with the Crimson Tide, at least until halftime.\n\nThe surprise twist: It was The Citadel, an FCS team, not a Southeastern Conference rival.\n\nTua Tagovailoa passed for 340 yards and three touchdowns, but the Tide struggled for 30-plus minutes before putting away The Citadel in a 50-17 victory on Saturday.\n\nAlabama coach Nick Saban said his team learned a lesson \u2014 it must be mentally prepared.\n\n\"I don't really care who you're playing,\" he said.\n\n\"Every team that comes here and plays us is going to give us their best shot,\" Saban added. \"These guys have got everything to gain and nothing to lose, and we've got nothing but downside in the game.\"\n\nAlabama (11-0), which had coasted against SEC opponents, went into halftime tied at 10 with the Bulldogs (4-6). It wasn't until 'Bama scored two touchdowns in a 12-second span on its way to a 27-point third quarter that the Tide could rest easy.\n\n\"I thought we played a great first half, and our players believed we had the best first half we could have had,\" The Citadel coach Brent Thompson said. \"We could have hung in there a little longer.\"\n\nTagovailoa completed 18 of 22 passes in three quarters, including touchdowns of 21 and 5 yards to Jaylen Waddle and a 68-yarder to tight end Irv Smith Jr. He broke AJ McCarron's school single-season record of 30 touchdown passes, reaching 31.\n\n\"Thirty-one touchdowns, that's cool,\" Tagovailoa said. \"But we've got another game to finish off this season and another game after that. We're more focused on finishing this season the right way.\"\n\nAlabama still has Auburn and then No. 5 Georgia in the SEC championship game.\n\nDamien Harris got most of his 83 yards on a 73-yard run in the fourth quarter, but he was injured on the play. He stayed on the ground for a couple of minutes before trotting off after Saban went across the field to check on him.\n\nSaban said Harris appeared to have a mild concussion.\n\nHenry Ruggs III gained 114 yards on six catches.\n\nDante Smith ran for a 45-yard touchdown in the first half and a 44-yarder in the fourth for The Citadel, whose triple option offense gave Alabama troubles at times. Smith finished with 130 yards on nine carries.\n\nQuarterback Brandon Rainey attempted only two passes, both incomplete, but ran 25 times for 79 yards.\n\nAlabama was coming off back-to-back shutouts of ranked SEC West rivals but lost two fumbles in this one.\n\nJacob Godek had sent the Bulldogs into the half all even with a 48-yard field goal on the final play.\n\n\"We're not scared of anybody,\" Rainey said. \"I think we came out and played our butts off.\"\n\nAfter the Tide fumbled away the second-half kickoff, the Bulldogs missed a field goal attempt that would have given them the lead.\n\nFinally, Alabama's offense got going. Tagovailoa hit Ruggs down the right sideline for a 54-yard gain. Then he found Waddle for a 5-yard touchdown and the Tide regained the lead.\n\nAnfernee Jennings scooped and scored on an 18-yard fumble recovery shortly after that, and it was a more comfortable 24-10 game with a lead that continued to grow.\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nThe Citadel: Managed to keep Alabama's offense off the field for large chunks of the first half, including 21 plays and trips across midfield on its two opening possessions. Had 60 carries for 275 yards.\n\nAlabama: Didn't flex its muscles until the second half. Kicking troubles continued with Joseph Bulovas missing an extra point and getting another blocked.\n\nHURTS RETURNS\n\nAlabama backup quarterback Jalen Hurts came into the game in the fourth quarter to a loud ovation. Hurts had missed the past two games with an ankle injury, and Saban said the goal going into the game was to get him 12 to 15 plays.\n\nHOME STREAK\n\nAlabama set the school record with its 25th consecutive home win. The previous mark of 24 was set from 1971-74.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Citadel: Closes the regular season against Charleston Southern.\n\nAlabama: Tries to complete a perfect regular season at home against rival Auburn in the Iron Bowl.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Younger added 12 for Presbyterian (3-2). The Blue Hose hit three consecutive 3-pointers to take a 40-35 lead with 13:46 remaining.\n\nMarquette, which made just one of its first 16 3-point attempts, hit five consecutive ones from beyond the arc, opening a 55-46 lead on Chartouny's 3-pointer from the right corner with 7:45 remaining.\n\n\"Obviously, when you see the ball go in, it helps you feel good and helps your confidence go up, but you can't just rely on scoring,\" said Chartouny, a third-team All-Atlantic 10 pick last season. \"Sometimes you're not going to be able to score, so you're going to have to do other stuff to get yourself going.\"\n\nChartouny averaged 17 minutes over Marquette's first three games but was 0 for 5 from the field and missed all four 3-point attempts.\n\n\"When the ball goes in, the basket starts getting a little bit bigger,\" Presbyterian coach Dustin Kerns said. \"I thought we did good job of defending the three-point line and defending them.

There was a lot of game pressure on our guys, and our guys responded.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nPresbyterian: The Blue Hose are following up victories over Welch and Boyce with consecutive games against ranked opponents since becoming a Division I program.\n\nMarquette: With early victories over weak nonconference opponents, the Golden Eagles will have a better feel for where they stand over the next five-game stretch, which includes No. 2 Kansas, either Louisville or No. 5 Tennessee, and No. 12 Kansas State.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nMarquette trailed 43-37 when Joey Hauser hit a 3-pointer to make it 43-40.

(AP Photo/Woody Marshall) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Coach Pat Narduzzi wasn't worried about a jinx. The Pitt coach had his equipment staff to bring the commemorative ACC caps and T-shirts all the way from Pittsburgh.\n\n\"I said, 'Get them. It's going to happen,'\" Narduzzi said.\n\nIt did happen \u2014 thanks to Kenny Pickett's career day.\n\nPickett threw a career-best three touchdown passes, all in the second half, and Pittsburgh beat Wake Forest 34-13 on Saturday to clinch its first berth in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game.\n\n\"Everyone knows this is a special group,\" Pickett said. \"Honestly, we show it every week. We play with the kind of heart and toughness that I don't think is seen very often in this day and age in football.\"\n\nPickett finished 23 of 30 for a career-high 316 yards with scoring passes of 4 yards to Rafael Araujo-Jones, 63 yards to Taysir Mack and 23 yards to Maurice Ffrench.\n\nDarrin Hall had a 2-yard touchdown run and left tackle Stefano Millin added a late 6-yard scoring run for the Panthers (7-4, 6-1), who won their fourth straight \u2014 their longest winning streak in two years. They will play in their first title game since joining the league in 2013, taking on No. 2 Clemson on Dec. 1 in Charlotte.\n\nAs the final seconds ticked away, Narduzzi received a victory bath. Some of the players took turns waving the huge \"Pitt\" flag in front of the Panthers' fans. And many of them pulled those Coastal Division championship T-shirts over their jerseys and pads.\n\n\"We're one step closer to where we want to go,\" Narduzzi said.\n\nJamie Newman was 15 of 30 for 206 yards with a 28-yard touchdown pass to Alex Bachman for the Demon Deacons (5-6, 2-5), who must beat Duke next week to qualify for their third straight bowl.\n\nNick Sciba kicked two field goals, including a 20-yarder with 12:30 to play that made it 20-13. Pickett and the Panthers then methodically went 78 yards in 11 plays and chewed up more than 5 minutes before the sophomore quarterback hit Ffrench on a post pattern for the score with 7:27 left that effectively sealed it.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nPittsburgh: The Panthers climbed the Coastal Division standings with their running game, which ranks second only to Georgia Tech in the ACC with an average of nearly 257 yards. This was only the fourth time this season they were held to fewer than 200 yards rushing, but Pickett proved Pitt can move it through the air, too.\n\n\"It's just kind of how the chips fell this week \u2014 we had to throw it a little bit, and we made some plays,\" Pickett said. \"We were explosive, like I said we were going to be all year.\"\n\nWake Forest: One question hanging over the Demon Deacons centers on coach Dave Clawson's decision to kick two short field goals. Sciba's first kick on the first possession came on fourth-and-inches from the 15, and the second came on a fourth-and-goal from the 2 immediately after Pitt went up 20-10. But the real issue was that, of the Demon Deacons' first five possessions of the second half, four of them were three-and-outs that lasted less than 90 seconds.\n\n\"Defensively, we couldn't get off the field,\" Clawson said. \"We ended up getting worn down a little bit. . We didn't make the plays we had to make on offense.\"\n\nKEY STAT\n\nPitt had a huge advantage in time of possession, finishing at 39 minutes, 31 seconds, while Wake Forest was at 20:29. The Panthers ran 77 offensive plays to a season-low 58 for the Demon Deacons. Pitt had three scoring drives that each exceeded both 10 plays and 5 minutes.\n\nWORST BEATING FIRST\n\nFor the second straight year, one of the teams in the ACC title game suffered its only conference loss to the last-place team in its division. The only league team to beat Pitt was cellar-dwelling North Carolina, 38-35 on Sept. 22. Last year, Clemson's lone conference loss came to last-place Syracuse.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPittsburgh: Finishes the regular season next Saturday at Miami.\n\nWake Forest: Wraps up the regular season next Saturday at instate rival Duke.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The NHL and lawyers for retired players say a tentative settlement has been reached in a concussion lawsuit brought against the league. The league and players\u2019 lawyers on Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, announced a tentative non-class settlement had been reached in the consolidated case after months of court-ordered mediation. The lawsuit involved more than1 00 former players who accused the NHL of failing to better prevent head trauma or warn players of such risks while promoting violent play that led to their injuries. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAt the Stanley Cup Finals earlier this year, Commissioner Gary Bettman couldn't talk enough about the feel-good story of the Vegas Golden Knights and the NHL's role in bringing major league sports to Las Vegas.\n\nWhen it came to a question about concussions and the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Bettman wasn't nearly as chatty.\n\n\"There's nothing new on the subject,\" Bettman said before turning to Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly and asking, \"Do you want to answer that?\"\n\nDaly didn't, though he did note that the NHL believes there's not enough scientific information to draw a definite link between concussions and CTE.\n\n\"This is not the commissioner's view, it's the science view,\" Daly said.\n\nNo big surprise there, since Bettman and Daly run a league that has tolerated \u2014 and tacitly condoned \u2014 players hitting each other in the head ever since the era of the league's Original Six began in 1942. And it is true that while there is increasing research that indicates concussions can cause CTE, there is a lot more researchers need to learn about head injuries before establishing it as a scientific fact.\n\nStill, the NHL moved this week to settle a lawsuit from former players who accused the league of failing to warn them about the dangers of concussions and about the risks of playing hockey. The league agreed to settle with retired players in a deal that could net each $22,000 and make them eligible for up to $75,000 in medical treatment.\n\nThat's not much for players who got their brains scrambled playing the hard-nosed sport of hockey. More importantly, perhaps, is that it's not an admission that the league did anything wrong, with the NHL not acknowledging any liability.\n\nIt's simply a way to move on, with a token payment to the 318 retired players settling the legal score.\n\nThe total cost to the NHL is $18.9 million, a far cry from the NFL concussion settlement that covers 20,000 former players with payouts expected to top $1.5 billion over 65 years. As of last month, the NFL concussion lawsuit claims panel had already approved more than $500 million in awards and paid out $330 million.\n\nOne reason the numbers are so different is that the NFL is a much bigger league than the NHL, generating about three times the revenue that major league hockey does. Another is that a federal judge denied class-action status in July for the lawsuit, preventing another potential 5,000 retired players from being involved.\n\nThe main reason, though, is that while the NFL attitude toward concussions softened over the years, the NHL wasn't about to change its stance that there isn't enough evidence to show that blows taken to the head led to brain damage.\n\n\"When you have a defendant who has spent millions of dollars litigating a case for four years to prove that nothing is wrong with getting your brain bashed in, you can only get so far,\" players' attorney Stuart Davidson told The Associated Press. \"I think it's important for players who have an opportunity to settle their case with the NHL now to understand that before they get anything through a trial against the NHL, it's going to cost millions of dollars in experts to get there, and that's going to have to be paid for before they see a penny from any recovery, assuming they win.\"\n\nIn other words, a token settlement is better than no settlement at all.\n\nThe NHL will end up spending the equivalent of the salaries of one first line over a year to get rid of a problem that could have vexed the league for many years. It did so without having to acknowledge that high-speed collisions and ubiquitous fighting could lead to brain problems later in life.\n\nBettman's hard-line approach paid off, and that's no surprise.\n\nThis is a commissioner, you might recall, who canceled an entire season rather than let players get paid what they're worth. The lawsuit had already dragged on for four years, and with the NHL fighting it every step of the way, there wasn't much appetite among attorneys and most former players to take it further.\n\nIn the end, the players will get some medical testing and a few dollars. The NHL, meanwhile, will get protection from further suits at a small cost.\n\nPretty easy to figure out the winner in this one.\n\n___\n\nAP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

We\u2019re going to have to find out what they have to say.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s top diplomat has said the crown prince had \u201cabsolutely\u201d nothing to do with the killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in Virginia and a fierce critic of the royal family.\n\nMore: CIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s killing: reports\n\nKhashoggi was killed Oct. 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish and Saudi authorities say he was murdered inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom after he went there to get marriage documents.\n\nThe Saudis responded to the purported CIA assessment by calling it false and requesting proof of how the intelligence agency made the conclusions. The State Department, meanwhile, said in a statement to ABC News on Saturday that its assessment was not completed and reports that the United States had made \"a final conclusion are inaccurate.\"\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the president spoke of Saudi Arabia as \u201ca truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to take a lot of things into consideration\u201d when deciding what measures to take against the kingdom.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration announced sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the killing.\n\nBut the new assessment puts added pressure on Trump and Congress to move on harsher punishments against the regime, specifically when it comes to the crown prince.\n\nHere are a few options the United States could use to punish Saudi Arabia.\n\nMagnitsky sanctions\n\nThe Global Magnitsky Act allows in a provision that lawmakers can require the president to determine whether any person was complicit in Khashoggi's death.\n\nAlready, the U.S. has sanctioned 17 people in connection to Khashoggi's killing, but that list includes no one in the royal family.\n\nIn Congress, lawmakers said the U.S. sanctions on the 17 Saudis were a good first step but called on the Trump administration to go further.\n\nMore: US sanctions 17 Saudi nationals over Jamal Khashoggi's killing\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action does not put this issue to rest,\u201d said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cIt remains unclear whether the Trump Administration has determined who is responsible for this horrific incident.\u201d\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said he had \u201ca lot of concerns about the trajectory that Saudi Arabia is on right now, and I think a price needs to be paid.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Jamal Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, had messages for President Donald Trump and America in a video shown at his memorial service in Washington. USA TODAY\n\nThe sanctions take away visas and seize any U.S. assets. Lawmakers have the option to go over the president's head to sanction others connected to the killing.\n\nThis has happened before. In 2017, Congress passed sanctions against Russia due to election meddling in the 2016 election, a move the president wasn't fond of at the time.\n\nYemen conflict\n\nAnother option is for the United States to stop supporting Saudi Arabia in the conflict in Yemen.\n\nThe U.S. backing the Saudi regime has been marked by controversy as the death toll, including many children, continues to increase. The conflict has also led to widespread famine, leaving millions at risk of starving in Yemen.\n\nCongress has some options to cut off support. Lawmakers could request U.S. military personnel be withdrawn since the missions weren't OK'd by Congress.\n\nAlready, some lawmakers have hinted that they would take up measures preventing the U.S. from continuing to help Saudi Arabia in the effort, even before Khashoggi's killing.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., filed a bill in September that aimed to halt U.S. support in the Saudi-Yemen war, according to Roll Call. A new Democratic-controlled House could help the bill pass.\n\nSenators Todd Young, R-Ind. and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., told the New York Times it was time to end some of its support for Saudi Arabia, including its refueling missions, something the Trump administration ended earlier this month.\n\n\u201cIf the administration does not take immediate steps, including ending U.S. refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft, we are prepared to take additional action when the Senate comes back into session,\u201d the senators said in a statement.\n\nArms deal\n\nSince Khashoggi's killing, Trump has repeatedly said he does not want to nix $110 billion in U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia because it would hurt American companies and zap U.S. jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s a raw financial calculation \u2013 and experts say an inaccurate one \u2013 but the possible weapons sale has become a political flashpoint in the escalating debate over how to respond to Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in the Khashoggi case.\n\nWhether it goes through, or not, could have lasting consequences on the U.S.-Saudi relationship.\n\nMore: US weapons sales a flashpoint as President Trump presses Saudi Arabia over missing journalist\n\nDemocrats in Congress say canceling the arms sale would send a signal to the Saudi regime that it doesn\u2019t have carte blanche to murder journalists outsides its borders, particularly those who are American residents. Trump sees it differently.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the concept of stopping an investment of $110 billion into the United States,\u201d Trump said last week.\n\nThree Republicans and three Democrats introduced legislation this week that would suspend U.S. weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and impose mandatory sanctions on individuals responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nIt would also require the Trump administration to document human rights in Saudi Arabia and impose new accountability measures for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nSome say the Saudis could turn to another country as a diplomatic slap to the U.S. \u2013 and because money is not a real obstacle to the oil-rich country.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, Deirdre Shesgreen and the Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/17/jamal-khashoggi-killing-donald-trump-talks-cia-reporter-death/2039290002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Gibbs, Harvey key Irish over error-prone Tribe 73-64", "description": "T.J.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Kevin Harvick has always followed the path that best suits him, even when it created unnecessary chaos for him and his race team.\n\nHe picked fights with fellow competitors in spectacular fashion \u2014 Harvick grabbed Greg Biffle by the throat, jumped on the hood of Ricky Rudd's car, used moves learned as a high school wrestler to toss aside Carl Edwards \u2014 and showed little care for consequences.\n\nThen he became a father and learned to channel his anger.\n\n\"If I was jumping over the hood of a car right now, went into my house, had a 6-year-old ... do you know how embarrassed I would be to walk in the front door and answer that question, 'Hey, dad, why did you jump over that guy's car, grab him by the throat?'\" Harvick said. \"Then it would get more embarrassing as you take him to school, drive through the carpool lines to see his teachers that are all watching, as well.\"\n\nHarvick remained calm a week ago when a flat tire nearly deflated his remarkable season. He has eight victories this year, tied with Kyle Busch for most in the Cup Series, but a cheating violation cost him his automatic berth into Sunday's championship race. Harvick and the No. 4 team had to requalify at Phoenix , and that early tire problem could have ended his bid.\n\nBut he kept his composure, listened to interim crew chief Tony Gibson's instructions and salvaged a fifth-place finish that put him back in NASCAR's championship field. Harvick credited the growth he's had during an 18-year career that has him eligible for a second Cup title.\n\n\"I don't say all the right things, do all the right things,\" Harvick said. \"As you go through life, I would hope we all mature from a life standpoint to be able to be a better person. I still screw up a lot.\"\n\nIndeed, it's been a slippery two weeks for the most dominant driver of the season. Harvick had been expected all along to make Sunday's title-deciding race at Homestead-Miami Speedway, but his race-winning Ford from Texas had an illegal spoiler. Of his eight wins this season, two have been disqualified for rules violations.\n\nOnly the spoiler problem at Texas was egregious and perhaps will put an asterisk next to his name for all of his 2018 successes. Stewart-Haas Racing has not disputed NASCAR's claim that the team deliberately cheated and gained additional downforce, and crew chief Rodney Childers on Twitter copped to using an offset spoiler because other teams did it first.\n\nChilders was suspended for the final two weeks of the season, and Harvick was close to combative in the days after the penalty was issued. He masterfully deflected talk away from the cheating allegation and insulated his team from any distractions.\n\nHarvick is at his best when he feels he's got something to prove.\n\n\"I feel like we race with a chip on our shoulder every week,\" said Harvick, who leads the Cup series in top-five finishes, top-10s and laps led. \"As far as the motivation goes, it's always different. There's really nothing that's ever the same. It would be difficult to start a year if you didn't have anything, for me, that I could reach out and grab and wrap your arms around and motivate yourself.\n\n\"It's always a moving target. I think that target moves throughout the year, as well. You get into a situation like you had after Texas, then it's your spoiler.\"\n\nHarvick and Childers remain adamant the spoiler was not instrumental in the Texas victory, but competitors have their own opinions.\n\n\"The first question across my mind was how long?\" Kyle Busch said. \"How long has that been going on? What else are they doing?\"\n\nBusch has gone win-for-win with Harvick all season and the two head into the finale as the favorites. Along with reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr., the so-called Big Three combined for 20 of 35 victories. Should one of them win, they'd join Jimmie Johnson as the only active Cup drivers with multiple titles.\n\nStanding in their way is Joey Logano, who got his program up to speed during the playoffs and is a viable challenger.\n\nEverything Harvick has worked for this year will be decided in three hours Sunday. But if the race doesn't go his way, it won't ruin the season.\n\n\"You want to win the championship because obviously you think it would be icing on the cake with everything that you've accomplished,\" Harvick said. \"But it's just not that easy. There's nothing that's going to devastate us to the point of not being able to function any more, but to go along with everything we've done this year, it definitely would seem fitting to add that to the year end.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Facing a major-conference opponent for the first time in program history, North Alabama was up to the task, forcing a tight contest with Pittsburgh on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe talent level of the Panthers won out in the end, with Pitt (5-0) pulling ahead late for a 71-66 victory. But the Lions (1-3) certainly made an impression.\n\n\"I'm really proud of our team for finding a way to win when we weren't at our best, and we weren't at our best because of North Alabama,\" Pitt coach Jeff Capel said.\n\nNorth Alabama led by four at the half and played a frustrating, scrappy defense that held the Panthers to a season-low 39 percent shooting.\n\n\"I thought they played really, really hard and they pressured us,\" Capel said. \"We had to work harder offensively to get into stuff. That's the first time we've faced pressure like that, I thought that threw us off we weren't as connected.\"\n\nFreshman point guard Xavier Johnson was the difference-maker for the Panthers. He led all scorers with a career-high 23 points, including several driving layups as the teams traded baskets down the stretch and a pair of free throws that iced the victory in the final seconds.\n\nKendarius Smith (19 points) and Jamari Blackmon (13 points) paced a more-balanced Lions attack. North Alabama had nine different players find the net and led in bench points, 22-9.\n\nPitt's fortunes in the paint improved when forward Emanuel Littles fouled out with just over five minutes remaining. He had a game-high 10 rebounds.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNorth Alabama: The Lions also played a tight contest at Saint Louis, and don't seem intimidated by an unfriendly atmosphere. Their level of competitiveness bodes well for their chances in the Atlantic Sun, where they were picked last in the conference's preseason poll.\n\n\"To hold them at 39 percent from the field and 17 percent from the 3-point line, that's a plus for us,\" Lions coach Tony Pujol said. \"To be pound-for-pound on the boards with a team like this is a plus for us.\"\n\nPitt: The Panthers had their worst shooting game of the season and didn't get their usual level of contribution from senior wing Jared Wilson-Frame. The team's leading scorer, he came in averaging 21.3 points and five made 3-pointers per game, but was held to nine points and 1 for 6 from outside the arc.\n\nYOUNG LEADER\n\nWith Pitt's first four games ending in solid victories, it was the first time Johnson has been asked to lead the offense in a tight contest down the stretch.\n\n\"'X' is obviously a great player,\" said Pitt captain Malik Ellison. \"The ball is going to be in his hands. He makes great decisions with it.\"\n\nTIRED LEGS\n\nThe game was the third in five days and second in under 48 hours for the Panthers, and their inability to finish at the rim might have been influenced by some tired legs.\n\n?\"This was the end of an energy cycle for us,\" Capel said. \"When you add those elements against a team that's hungry, we were in the position that we were in.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNorth Alabama: Hosts NAIA Martin Methodist on Tuesday.\n\nPitt: Will leave home for the first time this season when they face Saint Louis in New York on Wednesday.\n\n_____________\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

There aren\u2019t very many things that shock me anymore. But surprised. And Crawford was, too.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nWhat Jones, Ker and other Cowboys from the 1982 to 1987 teams have been discussing: One of their former teammates on Sunday is set to become the first known NFL player to marry a man. A linebacker whom Jones and other Cowboys remember was popular with women \u2013 Jeff Rohrer.\n\n\n\n\u201cWomen loved him because he was a gentleman, he was smart and a good football player,\u2019\u2019 Jones said. \u201c\u2026 If you had said, \u2018Ed, get me a list of five people in the history of the game (you think are gay),\u2019 he wouldn\u2019t have been nowhere near it.\u2019\u2019\n\nJim Jeffcoat, a defensive end on those Cowboys teams, noted that Rohrer eventually married and had two children. Jeffcoat said he called teammates after the news broke last week. \u201cThey were obviously a little bit stunned. But they respect him and respect his privacy,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Rohrer, who is set to exchange vows with his partner, Joshua Ross, in Los Angeles, has begun to surrender his privacy. It began with the New York Times story that was published Wednesday. When told how some of his former teammates reacted, Rohrer chuckled and said it\u2019s understandable they were surprised to learn he is gay.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was not practicing that lifestyle at all,\u2019\u2019 Rohrer said. \u201cAnd I had girlfriends. I had a lot of girlfriends. And was enjoying that part of my life. And life\u2019s a journey. That was part of my life.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nRohrer mentioned \u201cNorth Dallas Forty,\u2019\u2019 a 1979 film that captured the debauchery of professional football. \u201cWe had a lot of fun on the Cowboys, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWhen you see \u2018North Dallas Forty,\u2019 that\u2019s not a film, that\u2019s a documentary.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nHenderson, the famous Cowboys linebacker, said that although he did not play with Rohrer, they have been together at many Cowboys alumni events.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy first thought was, \u2018Oh, wow, I\u2019ve never known a gay linebacker.\u2019 Not that there aren\u2019t (any),\u2019\u2019 Henderson said.\n\n\u201cI feel sad that he had to live in that closet all those years. That has to be very painful. But I\u2019ll see him at some reunion coming up, and I\u2019m going to just tell him I\u2019m happy for him.\u2019\u2019\n\nRohrer, who started for the Cowboys in 1985, 1986 and 1987, said he told only a few former teammates that he is gay and getting married because he wanted to keep it low-profile. That changed after the New York Times story. Rohrer said Mike Saxon, a punter on those Cowboys team, is expected to attend his wedding.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if any other guys are coming or not,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all welcome. If you\u2019re putting this up (online) before the wedding, come on, boys. The more the merrier.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nRohrer added that he was unsure how ex-teammates were responding, but Jones captured the sentiment of former Cowboys who spoke with USA TODAY Sports on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s my teammate and nothing but respect for him,\u2019\u2019 said Jones. \u201cHe was a very hard worker. Dealing with injuries. Jeff always worked very hard to stay on the field, and I admired that about him.\u2019\u2019\n\nRohrer told the Times that if he had come out in the 1980s, he would have been cut immediately. He amended that statement in an interview with USA TODAY Sports, saying he might have been allowed to stay after he\u2019d won a starting job. Jones expressed more conviction.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would bet my last hard-earned dime that Tom Landry wouldn\u2019t have cut Jeff Rohrer,\u2019\u2019 Jones said of the late Cowboys coach. \u201cCoach Landry would have sat him down and just lectured to him like he would have anybody else with any other issue and just let him know pretty much, \u2018Hey now, once the word is out, know what to expect \u2026 But I will be here to support you. I got your back on whatever you need.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n\nFormer Cowboys receiver Mike Renfro agreed that Landry would have likely supported Rohrer.\n\n\u201cCould\u2019ve caused some problems internally,\u201d Renfro said. \u201cKnowing Coach Landry, I think it would have been OK if the public and his teammates perceived it as OK \u2026 Jeff was a pretty cool guy. He was easygoing. He would do anything for you. He was fun and vivacious. But I don\u2019t know if coming out would have changed the perception or relationships.\u2019\u2019\n\nDoug Cosbie, a former Cowboys tight end, said of Rohrer, \u201cI\u2019m just happy for him, that he can be who he is.\n\n\u201cMy whole take on kind of life in general is we\u2019re here to love each other, not to judge people.

For nearly two days, Ella did what Ella does: protect those she loves.\n\nHer own family's home was gone, but one single neighbor's home was standing. So Ella waited there.\n\nThe Copsey family was forced to evacuate their Paradise, California home as the swift-moving fire tore through their neighborhood.\n\nIn the midst of chaos, owner Leahna Copsey thought about Ella and hoped for the best. But they had to go.\n\nAs Leahna and her children fled down the road, what she thought were merely headlights became bright orange flames. Her daughter, Clarisa, 8, complained of the heat on her face.\n\nWere they going to die?, she asked.\n\nCopsey knew they might not have a home or Ella to go back to.\n\nJust a precaution\n\nWhen Copsey noticed black clouds outside from a window in her Paradise home, she didn\u2019t think much of it. She had read on her Facebook weather page that a small fire had broken out in the hills and thought it would be taken care of soon.\n\nAs the morning progressed, Copsey began to paint the ceiling in her master bedroom. The next day new carpet would be delivered and then she and husband Mike Copsey would be able to move back into the space.\n\nThe sky continued to darken.\n\n\u201cI thought it was raining,\u201d she said. \u201cI went and put my hands out and charcoal fell from the trees.\u201d\n\nThat got her moving. As a precaution, Copsey packed up some odds and ends, including the girls' school books. They\u2019d do homework in Chico until the evacuation was lifted.\n\nThey had just gone through this the year before.\n\nThat time, the family filled their car with clothing, food and other necessities. It was \u201cpacked full,\u201d 10-year-old Emma Copsey remembers.\n\nThis go-round, they didn\u2019t want to take the time. The fire was nowhere near their home and they hadn\u2019t been ordered to evacuate.\n\nBut this fire wasn't like the others.\n\nAnd it wasn't long before a quick drive down the road became a nearly three-hour fight for their lives. The family battled bottlenecked traffic, flames on either side of their car and smoke.\n\n\u201cAll you could see was where the fire wasn\u2019t,\u201d Copsey said. \u201cIt was like something out of a movie. They had no idea where the fire was, and for it to jump like that \u2013 it was unreal.\u201d\n\nThe family managed to escape the blaze and settled in lower Lake County, nearly two hours away from their home, to wait it out.\n\nA good girl\n\nAs the hours trailed on and news of the devastation began to fill news outlets and social media, they began to fear the worst.\n\nThen they learned their home was gone. Surely Ella was, too.\n\n\u201cShe was protecting the only house left on the block.\u201d Leahna Copsey\n\nThen, a friend called. He had gotten back into the evacuated area on Saturday. And through the haze in this destroyed town he'd seen Ella, right there in front of the next-door neighbors home.\n\n\u201cShe was protecting it,\u201d Copsey said. \u201cShe was protecting the only house left on the block.\u201d\n\nThe family erupted in excitement. Ella had been burned and was exhausted, but she was going to be alright.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a really good dog, so I was really relieved she was alive and it was only minor burns,\u201d Clarisa said.\n\nElla was treated for her burns and is staying with the family\u2019s oldest daughter, Kayla Westman. Westman has several photos and videos of Ella sleeping on her chest, her legs wrapped in bandages.\n\nOn Wednesday, less than a week after the fire, the family began the first steps to rebuild.\n\nAt the Butte Humane Society, they picked up a dog crate, bed, food and toys for Ella.\n\nThe generosity brought Copsey to tears.\n\n\u201cTo have those basic needs met is amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to think about. It\u2019s a burden that has been lifted.\u201d\n\nA pet food pantry\n\nCatheryn Thompson, Butte Human Society adoption coordinator, hands a Camp Fire victim a bag of dog food at the organization's pet supply and food pantry in Chico on Wednesday, November 14, 2018.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Les Miles could be back in the Big 12 soon.\n\nThe former Oklahoma State coach, who led LSU to the 2007 national championship before getting fired four games into the 2016 season, is in negotiations with Kansas to take over the down-trodden Jayhawks, a person with knowledge of the discussions told The Associated Press on Saturday.\n\nThe person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal was not complete. There are numerous details to work out, though those are expected to be finalized in the coming days.\n\nMiles would take over for David Beaty, who was fired two weeks ago. Beaty agreed to finish out his fourth season, and is 6-30 heading into Saturday night's game at sixth-ranked Oklahoma.\n\nMiles has long been considered the front-runner for the job because of his close relationship with new Kansas athletic director Jeff Long. The two worked together at Michigan and stayed in touch over the years. Long tried to hire Miles when he was the AD at Arkansas.\n\nSports Illustrated first reported Friday that Long and Miles were in negotiations.\n\nMiles, who turned 65 last week, turned around Oklahoma State over the course of four years before leaving for LSU, where he inherited Nick Saban's powerhouse. He won a national title three years later, then lost to Saban and Alabama in the national championship game following the 2011 season.\n\nBut Tiger fans began to grow frustrated with Miles' reluctance to adapt to the air-it-out offenses that began to sweep through college football. And despite reaching a bowl game every season during his tenure in Baton Rouge, he was let go after a 2-2 start to the 2016 season.\n\nAnything close to that level of success would be welcome at Kansas.\n\nThe Jayhawks haven't had a winning season or reached a bowl game since 2008, their penultimate season under Mark Mangino. After he was forced out, the school churned through Turner Gill and Charlie Weis before hiring Beaty, a nondescript assistant with ties to the program.\n\nBeaty did well in restoring scholarship numbers and generating fan interest, fixing many of the problems created by Gill's and Weis's failed tenures. He landed better prospects, including several from Louisiana that will no doubt be familiar with Miles, and brought an unceasing energy that served him well as he tried to turn around the Jayhawks' moribund program.\n\nThe only thing missing was the wins. Beaty has beaten just two Big 12 opponents, both of them at home, and his inability to get the Jayhawks close to a bowl game led to his ouster.\n\nNow, it appears Miles is close to getting the next shot.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Terry Renna) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Joe Gibbs issued a team order on the eve of NASCAR's championship that gave Kyle Busch an edge over the other three title contenders.\n\nBusch was gifted the coveted No. 1 pit stall Saturday when Joe Gibbs Racing made the dubious decision to force teammate and pole winner Denny Hamlin to pass on the top spot. Busch qualified second and grabbed the favorable pit stall after Hamlin's team yielded to Gibbs' demand.\n\n\"It's an advantage for them, which stinks for us,\" reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr. said.\n\nBusch will take any perk he can when he races Truex, Joey Logano and Kevin Harvick for the title Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's an upper-management decision, and that's part of it. I understand,\" Hamlin said. \"Sat down with Joe quite a bit. He came over pretty fast to talk to me. I could see the other side of it. If the roles were reversed, I think we would hope for the same thing.\"\n\nBusch should have an advantage because the stall in question is located at the end of pit road and gives drivers a clear exit path and cleaner shot back onto the track. The short exit distance also lessens the concern of a speeding penalty.\n\n\"It's great to have the No. 1 pit stall for the race and I appreciate the teamwork by the guys on the 11,\" Busch said. \"Coach and everyone at JGR are focused on doing what they can to bring a championship for the company.\"\n\nTeam owner Tony Stewart, who fields Harvick's No. 4 Ford, lauded JGR's call.\n\n\"Smart decision,\" he said. \"If we were in the same position, I would hope we'd be smart enough to do the same thing. I've already seen all the drama and people complaining. These four teams are here to win a championship. If your organization can help you do that and give you every tool available to get that done, you're stupid to not do it. I'm behind what JGR did 100 percent.\"\n\nHamlin, who is winless this season, and crew chief Mike Wheeler had the traditional first choice of pit stalls because Hamlin posted the fastest qualifying lap. Hamlin also won the pole a year ago but denied Truex's request for the pit stall. Truex, a Toyota partner of Hamlin's but not an official teammate, went on to win the race anyway.\n\n\"Hopefully, it all just comes back full circle. Maybe I'll even get a thank you text,\" Hamlin said.\n\nGibbs, the Super Bowl and NASCAR champion, said he made the call this time.\n\n\"Anything like this always stops with me,\" Gibbs said.\n\nHamlin said both he and Gibbs spoke to officials from FedEx and the sponsor understood the decision for JGR to show favoritism.\n\nBut he worried that helping Busch for one race may have made the practice acceptable.\n\n\"The problem is, from my standpoint is it probably will set a precedent going forward,\" Hamlin said. \"It probably will be a manufacturer thing more so than a teammate. I hate it, too, because I denied Martin last year. Luckily, he won the race anyway, but I just think it's a tough deal, and you've got to listen to the boss.\"\n\nBusch said Friday he thought the idea would get shot down as it did for Truex, and Hamlin didn't seem eager to give up his prize. He's trying to extend a streak of winning at least one race every season since his 2006 rookie year, and Sunday marks his final race with Wheeler.\n\nEven Busch understood it was a big ask of Hamlin.\n\n\"That's probably too far, but it would sure be nice,\" Busch said.\n\nBusch, the 2015 Cup champion, got what he wanted when Hamlin's team chose the No. 4 pit stall, which did not violate any NASCAR policy. But Brad Keselowski, Logano's teammate at Team Penkse, ripped JGR's decision to manipulate the process.\n\n\"Good for the company, bad for the sport,\" he said.\n\nLogano has the third stall, Truex has the seventh spot and Harvick has the 39th spot.\n\nLogano swept Saturday's two practice sessions and hit 171.701 mph for the fastest lap in the second session.\n\nBusch scraped the wall in the closing minutes of the second practice and scuffed the Toyota on the rear right side.\n\n\"They all look like that at some point during the weekend. Better in practice than in the race, but it's just minor, minor damage,\" crew chief Adam Stevens said. \"It's nothing we can't fix in short order.\"\n\nLogano also had the best 10-consecutive lap average in the final practice (165.018), followed by Truex and Busch. Harvick was 10th overall and only averaged 163.124 over his fastest 10 laps. He starts 12th, lowest of the title contenders.\n\n\"Honestly, it really hasn't been that good,\" Harvick said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Douglas DeFelice, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWith two of their upcoming games flexed into the Sunday night slot, the Chicago Bears are unquestionably in the NFL's limelight.\n\nIt's not hard to see why the surprise leaders of the NFC North might drive so much interest. First-year coach Matt Nagy's group is well ahead of schedule, with Mitchell Trubisky on pace to break franchise passing records and the ascending defense tied for fourth in scoring (19.4 points a game).\n\nYet for the Bears to claim their first playoff berth and division title since 2010, they'll have to conquer the foes that know them best. Four of the final seven games are against NFC North opponents, and none might end up more important than Sunday's meeting with Minnesota.\n\nWhile Trubisky and the rest of Chicago's offense will have arguably the biggest test of their season so far against the league's fifth-ranked defense, the tipping point of the game might be whether Khalil Mack and the Bears' pass rush can rattle Kirk Cousins.\n\nMore: Indianapolis Colts' Andrew Luck quietly becoming one of the NFL's hottest quarterbacks\n\nMore: Cowboys' Travis Frederick sees hope, progress after 'scary' Guillain-Barre Syndrome diagnosis\n\nAfter missing two contests with an ankle injury, Mack returned last week to record two of the Bears' six sacks of Matthew Stafford in a 34-22 win over the Detroit Lions. One of his takedowns illustrated the magnitude of the problem he poses to opponents: After evading a chip from tight end Levine Toilolo, Mack pushed left tackle Taylor Decker back and off his feet en route to the quarterback.\n\nMinnesota might similarly struggle to wall off Mack even with significant resources dedicated to the task, but help should be on the way. Having already started five different combinations of offensive linemen, the Vikings could have their first-string front in full force if guards Mike Remmers and Tom Compton, both listed as questionable, are able to play.\n\nFor Kirk Cousins, the challenge of managing the pass rush will be not only to avoid taking sacks and falling behind against a defense that is allowing opponents to convert only 34.4 percent of third-down conversions, but also refrain from committing turnovers. The Bears rank first in the NFL in interceptions (16) and points off turnovers (89).\n\nCousins so far this season has limited his critical errors and thrown just five interceptions, but an even quicker trigger might be needed against Chicago. Adam Thielen, coming off a season-low 22-yard performance in Week 9 against the Lions, faces a key showdown in the slot against standout cornerback Bryce Callahan.\n\nHere are four other matchups that will define Week 11:\n\nCowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott vs. Falcons' linebackers\n\nWith 187 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns against the Eagles, Elliott turned in what might have been a season-saving performance for the Cowboys last week in a 27-20 win. Even as Dak Prescott begins to show signs of progress after the arrival of Amari Cooper, a similar effort from the offense's centerpiece likely will be needed against the Falcons. It was just a year ago that Dallas fell flat in a 27-7 loss to Atlanta that Elliott sat amid a suspension.\n\nPlenty has changed for the Falcons' defense, however. Three starters have been sidelined with injuries. The unit won't be getting a boost from Deion Jones, who was designated for return from injured reserve and practiced this week but was ruled out on Friday. After Nick Chubb ripped off a 92-yard run and the Browns piled up 211 rushing yards in a win over the Falcons last week, Atlanta's linebackers look particularly vulnerable to Elliott's skill set.\n\nEagles WR Golden Tate vs. Saints CB P.J. Williams\n\nIn a largely disappointing debut for the defending champions last week following his trade from the Lions, Tate caught just two passes for 19 yards in a loss to the Cowboys that dropped the Eagles to the fringes of the NFC playoff picture. A heavier workload should be ahead against the Saints, who rank third-worst with 8.8 yards allowed per attempt. Tate also has thrived against New Orleans in the past with 35 catches for 485 yards and five touchdowns in five games.\n\nWilliams has been consistently overmatched in the slot and ranks as Pro Football Focus' fourth-worst cornerback this season. More coverage lapses against Tate could spark a shootout.\n\nRedskins' offensive line vs. Texans DE J.J. Watt and LB Jadeveon Clowney\n\nWith 14.5 combined sacks, Watt and Clowney have positioned themselves as the NFL's most fearsome edge-rushing pair. Awaiting them is a Washington offensive front in disrepair following the loss of starting guards Brandon Scherff and Shawn Lauvao and backup offensive tackle Geron Christian. The turning point, however, could be the health of Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams, who is questionable with a thumb injury.\n\nDespite the danger Watt and Clowney pose to opposing quarterbacks, the bigger issue for Washington could rest in the Texans' ability to stop the run. Houston ranks second in the NFL with just 3.6 yards allowed per carry and has allowed only two runs of 20 yards or more this season. That could spell trouble for Washington if Adrian Peterson isn't able to keep Alex Smith out of obvious passing situations. The Redskins are tied for 26th in first downs through the air (98).\n\nChiefs WR Tyreek Hill vs. Rams CB Marcus Peters\n\nAhead of their highly anticipated Monday night showdown with the Chiefs, the Rams have a division rival to thank for one of the best demonstrations yet of how to slow Kansas City's rapid-fire offense. The Cardinals last week held Andy Reid's attack to season lows in yardage (330) and points (26), racking up five sacks against a line that had only given up 12 total in the previous nine games. Part of what made that pressure possible was physical play and sticky coverage that pushed Patrick Mahomes into holding the ball on for longer than the quarterback desired.\n\nWhile the Rams have been plenty disruptive up front, the secondary could once again be Los Angeles' downfall if it can't replicate that physical play. Peters in particular looms as a problematic player. He gave up the game-winning 72-yard touchdown to the Saints' Michael Thomas two weeks ago and could be susceptible to big plays from the speedy Hill. Even with plenty of help over the top, Peters will be under pressure to show he's not a liability against his former team.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Nick Schwartz", "title": "Why the Warriors are giving Draymond Green 'time off'", "description": "Draymond Green and Kevin Durant won\u2019t be sharing the floor this weekend.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/why-the-warriors-are-giving-draymond-green-time-off", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/warriors1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T18:26:53Z", "content": "The Golden State Warriors have been without superstar Steph Curry, who is nursing a groin injury, and the defending champions will now be short another All-Star for the near future.

The monthslong review was conducted by the Washington D.C. law firm Williams & Connolly. It followed an allegation by writer Zinzi Clemmons that Diaz had forcibly kissed her. Other female writers on social media shared their encounters with Diaz.\n\nDiaz won the Pulitzer for fiction in 2008 for his novel \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.\"\n\nHe currently teaches at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT announced in June that it had completed a review and found no evidence of misconduct.\n\nMore: Author Junot D\u00edaz withdraws from writers' festival amid sexual misconduct allegations\n\nMore: Harvey Weinstein accused of raping actress Paz de la Huerta in new lawsuit\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/17/pulitzer-board-allows-junot-diaz-stay-after-harassment-allegations/2038471002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Wochit, USA TODAY, Wochit", "title": "Girl Scout Cookie conundrum", "description": "Congresswoman-elect Abigail Spanberger is one of her daughter's Girl Scout troop leaders.

This is a do-or-die game for Baltimore, as a loss would practically eliminate them from playoff contention this season while a win would throw them in the thick of it.\n\nThe last time the Ravens played the Bengals back in Week 2, Baltimore lost 34-23 in Cincinnati. The Bengals piled on the touchdowns in the first half, scoring 28 points before halftime. But the defense stood tall and held Cincinnati to just six points in the second half while the offense made a valiant comeback effort, getting within five points in the fourth quarter.\n\nThere\u2019s a few reasons why Baltimore should be concerned in this one, starting with their quarterback situation. But with everything on the line, the Ravens should put up a good show. Here\u2019s four reasons Baltimore will beat the Bengals in Week 11.\n\nThe Ravens are well-rested coming off of their bye week\n\nThe Ravens\u2019 bye week could not have come at a better time. Injuries were beginning to pile up, players were frustrated; and Baltimore kept losing.\n\nThe bye week offered the Ravens time to heal, some time away from football to clear their minds; and allowed coaches to go back to the drawing board and figure out what needs to change in order to win.\n\nGoing into the bye week, the Ravens were banged up. The offensive line was missing starting tackles James Hurst and Ronnie Stanley. Other players like guard Alex Lewis, cornerback Marlon Humphrey and linebacker C.J. Mosley were all banged up.\n\nThe injury report for this week is looking a lot cleaner. Baltimore has only two players listed as \u201cout.\u201d Many of the names that had appeared in recent weeks were able to practice either partially or completely. That leaves the Ravens significantly healthier, especially along the offensive line which had been one of the glaring holes in recent weeks.\n\nBaltimore should be rejuvenated coming off of their bye week. That could be a big factor in getting a win against the Bengals."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Wochit, Wochit-All, Wochit", "title": "Girl Scout Cookie conundrum", "description": "Girl Scout cookies are what we need right now", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2018/11/17/girl-scout-cookie-conundrum/38551391/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5968399533001_5968397191001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T17:14:04Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Doug Stanglin and John Fritze, USA TODAY", "title": "Trump to view California fire devastation he blamed on forest mismanagement", "description": "Trump to view California fire devastation he blamed on forest mismanagement", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/17/trump-view-california-fire-devastation-he-blamed-forest-mismanagement/2037886002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.kgw.com/assets/GANNETT/images/75444253-b6d8-47e2-9d88-b3fcc282bae4/75444253-b6d8-47e2-9d88-b3fcc282bae4_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T17:09:02Z", "content": "President Donald Trump headed to Northern California on Saturday for a first-hand view of the still-raging Camp Fire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century that has left at least 71 people dead.

The Ravens, coming off of their bye week, will be well rested and motivated to prove the doubters wrong.

If Baltimore loses to Cincinnati on Sunday, their playoff hopes are all but dashed. Here are three Ravens players to watch for this pivotal Week 11 matchup.\n\nRB Ty Montgomery\n\nAlthough most of the attention will be on the Ravens quarterback situation this week, there\u2019s another part of the offense that should have the fans and media\u2019s attention.\n\nTy Montgomery was traded to the Ravens two weeks ago for a 2020 seventh-round pick. Baltimore pulled the trigger due to the fact that the running game has been almost non-existent, averaging 92.7 yards per game. That ranks as the 27th best in the NFL, and their 3.6 yards per carry average ranks as second worst in the league.\n\nThat\u2019s why the team brought Montgomery in. A converted running back from wide receiver, Montgomery has shown that he can be an effective running back in the NFL. After being given the starting job in Green Bay in 2016, Montgomery rushed for 457 yards on just 77 attempts, which comes out to a 5.9 yards per carry average.\n\nHowever, in 2017, the Packers drafted running backs Aaron Jones and Jamal Willams, and they both began to push Montgomery down the depth chart. So much so the Packers viewed him as expendable. A late-game fumble against the Los Angeles Rams was the final straw for Montgomery and he was shipped to Baltimore the following week.\n\nMontgomery has the ability to change a game both running the ball and catching passes out of the backfield. It will be interesting where and how the Ravens decide to use him and slot him into their running back rotation \u2014 if he plays at all."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 18 Michigan facing GW in Tip-Off Tournament", "description": "The semifinals of the Air Force Reserve Tip-Off Tournament get started No. 18 Michigan facing George Washington", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/17/no-18-michigan-facing-gw-in-tip-off-tournament/38551225/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T16:39:04Z", "content": "UNCASVILLE, Conn.

Michigan won 84-61. (AP Photo/Stephen Dunn) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nUNCASVILLE, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Michigan coach John Beilein was concerned his Wolverines might suffer a letdown against George Washington after a blowout victory over No. 8 Villanova on the road.\n\nThere was still a tinge of worry during the first half of Saturday's semifinal of the Air Force Reserve Tip-Off tournament when GW (0-4) cut an 18-point Wolverine lead to six.\n\nBut No. 18 Michigan (4-0), which led by nine points at halftime, went on a 13-2 run to open the second half and finished with an easy 84-61 victory over the Colonials.\n\n\"A lot of the message after the Villanova game was handling success,\" Beilein said. \"Some kids struggle with that. It's very natural. Michigan is not going to fall into that trap.\"\n\nCharles Matthews led the Wolverines with 25 points and Jordan Poole made five of his eight 3-point shots to add a career-high 22. Zavier Simpson finished two assists shy of a triple-double with 14 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists.\n\nPoole had made just one 3-pointer on 10 attempts coming into the game and was shooting just over 23 percent from the field. He hit his first three shots and finished 7 of 12 from the floor. The sophomore guard insisted that nothing had changed with his shot, but Simpson said he noticed a difference.\n\n\"Me and Jordan were having a little contest before the game,\" Simpson said. \"We were basically bragging with each other how our shot was feeling good today. So I'm not sure what he was talking about feeling normal. Then he knocked the first one down. That was kind of like, 'I told you so.'\"\n\nMichigan, which gave up just 46 points in its 27-point victory at Villanova on Wednesday, held the Colonials to 39 percent shooting and outscored GW 17-2 on the fast break.\n\nD.J. Williams had 16 points to lead George Washington, which lost its second straight game to a ranked opponent after falling by 19 points at No. 4 Virginia last Sunday.\n\n\"We're a work in progress,\" GW coach Maurice Joseph said. \"The last two games, playing quality opponents, is something we can look back to in conference play and I think we'll be more battled tested. It's never fun taking these losses. But I believe our guys will grow from these opportunities.\"\n\nThe Wolverines play Providence in Sunday's championship game.\n\nPROVIDENCE-SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nDavid Duke scored 20 points to rally Providence to a 76-65 win over South Carolina.\n\nAlpha Diallo added 17 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for the Friars (3-1), who trailed by eight points at halftime and nine early in the second half.\n\nA.J. Reeves scored eight of his 10 points during a 10-0 Friars' run that put Providence on top 44-43.\n\nThe teams went back and forth before Jimmy Nichols followed a missed shot with the first of the three straight Providence dunks. That gave the Friars a 54-49 lead, led coach Ed Cooley to toss aside his suit jacket and brought the pro-Providence crowd to its feet.\n\nThe game was played 60 miles from the Friars' campus across the state line.\n\n\"We get a lot of fan support when we come down here, so it's definitely worth it to come,\" Cooley said. \"My jacket comes off and sometimes I don't even feel it. I don't. It's just a matter of getting into the game and getting excited.\"\n\nConsecutive 3-pointers from Duke and Isaiah Jackson made it 65-54 and put the game out of reach.\n\n\"I struggled a little bit before shooting the ball, but I came in today with a stay-positive attitude,\" Duke said. \"I know what I'm capable of and Coach put his trust in me. Once I got one, I started feeling it.\"\n\nHassani Gravett scored 14 points to lead four players in double figures for South Carolina (2-2).\n\nThe Gamecocks committed 38 fouls and made just six of 25 shots from 3-point range.\n\nMartin said he'll be looking for one thing on Sunday when the Gamecocks face George Washington in the consolation game.\n\n\"Growth,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, that's why you play these events. You line up and play Providence in Providence, even though we're just across the state line. You've got to challenge your team to force them to grow. We're privileged we get to play in the SEC, just like Providence in the Big East. Those are elite basketball conferences. It's our job as coaches, out duties, to prepare our teams to play in conference play.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He will face five-time champion Djokovic, who defeated Kevin Anderson 6-2, 6-2 to extend his semifinal win-loss record at the tournament to 7-1.\n\nFederer, 37, was seeking a record-extending seventh title, but was unable to cope with the pressure created by Zverev's power and precision at the O2 Arena.\n\n\"He (Zverev) apologized to me at the net,\" Federer said. \"I was like, 'Buddy, shut up. You don't need to apologize to me here. Congratulations on a great match and a great tournament so far. All the best for the finals.' And you move on.\"\n\nAn inspired series of shots earned Zverev the first break points of the match in the 12th game and Federer sent a forehand wide to fall behind.\n\nFederer willed himself to a break for 2-1 in the second set, but Zverev quickly composed himself to hit straight back in the following game.\n\nZverev overcame the freak interruption to establish a 5-4 lead in the tiebreaker, and Federer netted the simplest of forehand volleys to bring up match point.\n\nHe saved the first, but Zverev confidently put away a backhand drive volley to set up a shot at the biggest title of his career and leave Federer waiting until next season for his 100th title.\n\n\"Overall, I'm happy how the season went,\" said Federer, who picked up his 20th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open. \"There's many positives. So I'm excited for next season.\"\n\nDespite having reached only one Grand Slam quarterfinal this year, Zverev is the only active player outside the Big Four of Djokovic, Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray to have won three Masters titles. But victory at the tour's flagship event would exceed those achievements.\n\n\"Novak right now is the best player in the world,\" said Zverev, who lost to Djokovic in the round robin. \"You have to play your best game to even have a chance. I hope I'll be able to do that tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Serb maintained his record of having not lost a set \u2014 or service game \u2014 at the tournament as he thrashed debutant Anderson to give himself the chance to join Federer on six titles.\n\n\"I played very well in the group stage against Sascha (Zverev),\" Djokovic said. \"But I don't think he was close to his best.\"\n\nDjokovic won 20 out of 27 points on Anderson's second serve as he broke the South African twice in each set.\n\n\"It was the best match I've played so far this week,\" Djokovic said.\n\nHaving ended a two-year Grand Slam title drought by defeating Anderson in the Wimbledon final, Djokovic went on to win his 14th major trophy at the U.S. Open and has already sealed the year-end No. 1 ranking.\n\nThe victory extended Djokovic's record to 35-2 since the start of Wimbledon, a tournament he began ranked 21st after a right elbow injury interrupted his first half of the season.\n\n\"It's remarkable what he's done since Wimbledon,\" Anderson said. \"It seems like he's definitely right back playing some of the best tennis of his career.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He was committed to a hospital for the mentally ill.\n\nAuthorities said at the time that he had attacked the president in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster.\n\nThe latest consent order will allow Hinckley to live on his own. He is required to perform volunteer or paid work at least 3 days a week, and keep a daily log of his activities.\n\nHe has reportedly been working part time at a Williamsburg bookstore.\n\nHinckley is restricted to a 75-mile radius of Williamsburg and can travel unaccompanied, but will not be required to have a tracking device on his car. The order, however, does require him to carry a GPS-enabled cell phone whenever he is away from his residence.\n\nAs in the past, Hinckley must submit to regular treatment from a variety of mental health specialists.\n\nThe order allows him to use the Internet but not to search for information about himself, or join any social media sites.\n\nHinckley is banned from having weapons or consuming alcohol or illegal drugs. He must also avoid any contact with the news media, his victims and their families, the U.S. president, and members of Congress.\n\nHinckley attorney Barry Wm.

(And also a fine time for a GIF of Johnny Depp setting stuff on fire.)\n\nOK, let's break the big reveals down.\n\nQueenie (Alison Sudol) falls in with some bad folks in \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\" (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\nA hero takes a walk on the dark side.\n\nIn the \"Fantastic\" sequel, dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) gathers followers for his sinister plans for pure-blood wizards to rule the world. One of the folks who falls under his persuasive sway is mind reader Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol), whose romantic relationship with No-Maj boyfriend Jacob (Dan Fogler) isn't kosher with the magical law enforcement.\n\nAt a late-night rally at Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris, where Grindelwald shows his devotees future visions of World War II \u2013 rolling tanks, concentration camps, nuclear explosions \u2013 warning of what happens if wizards don\u2019t take their \"rightful place,\" Queenie chooses to go with him rather than stay with Jacob. It sets up a potential sister-vs.-sister matchup between Queenie and Tina (Katherine Waterston) in the third film, plus some relationship drama with her heartbroken beau.\n\nCredence Barebone (Ezra Miller) received some big news about his familial ties. (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\nThe Dumbledore family just got a new member.\n\nTroubled young wizard Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), possessing a dark Obscurus force and sought out by Grindelwald, is said to be part of a prophecy involving the last in a pure-blood wizarding line. French-African wizard Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam) tracks Credence to Paris, thinking he might be the mysterious Corvus Lestrange. However, Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz) comes clean with her dark secret, that her half-brother drowned on the way to America after she swapped him with a better-behaved baby aboard a soon-to-be-sinking ship (that may have been the Titanic?!) .\n\nThe truth, believe or not, is a lot more dramatic. At the end of the movie, Grindelwald tells Credence, who is desperate to find his true identity, that his real name is Aurelius Dumbledore, the long-lost brother of wizard Albus (Jude Law). Now, Grindelwald\u2019s not the most truthful guy and he might be saying this just to have an ultimate weapon against his former close friend (more on that in a minute). On the other hand, if Grindelwald's on the level, this is a huge, game-changing connection to one of the Potterverse\u2019s most key characters.\n\nMiller, a huge \u201cPotter\u201d fan, was excited to hear about Credence\u2019s new familial ties. \u201cGive me a scale of one to freaking out, and I'll tell you that I freaked out. I was buzzing,\u201d the actor tells USA TODAY, adding that he\u2019s geeked for what happens in the third \u201cBeasts\u201d film. \u201cFor me, the thing that\u2019s funny is I've been overpreparing for these films my entire life, ... If you think I haven't already put in something like 75,000 hours in a wormhole of thought and preparation into a movie I have not yet read a script for, then you clearly don't know me at all.\u201d\n\nThe good guys convene at Hogwarts to figure out next steps in a wizarding war at the end of the \"Fantastic Beasts\" sequel. (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\nBut there is good news \u2013 and maybe a way to turn the tide.\n\nWhat we know about Dumbledore and Grindelwald\u2019s very close, personal relationship is that it ended badly \u2013 the specifics probably will be revealed later, but Dumbledore tells his former pupil Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) he can\u2019t move against Grindelwald. The reason: As youngsters, Dumbledore and Grindelwald took a blood pact, so magically they can\u2019t fight each other.\n\nBut wait: At the sequel's end, the charm Grindelwald wears bearing their blood gets stolen by Newt\u2019s Niffler, a creature known for pilfering shiny things, and the finale finds Newt and his allies taking it to Dumbledore to see if he can destroy it. Because one way to foil a dark wizard is to unleash an equally powerful dude in Law's magic man.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/17/fantastic-beasts-spoilers-decoding-big-reveals-grindelwald/2007716002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Co-leaders Reed, Willett eye World Tour Championship title", "description": "Co-leaders Patrick Reed and Danny Willett closed Saturday at 14-under 202 and will enter the final day of the European Tour's season-ending DP World Tour Championship as co-leaders", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2018/11/17/co-leaders-reed-willett-eye-world-tour-championship-title/38550909/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1143d0448aa17af7cebcab970cc29ee73a5e696b/c=0-168-4034-2437/local/-/media/2018/11/17/USATODAY/usatsports/f66da825d0b94b5e8e00c7ae434d8892.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T15:15:31Z", "content": "Rory McIlroy from Northern Ireland looks at his shot on the 1st hole during the third round of the DP World Tour Championship golf tournament in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018.

The National Park Service bought a portion of Paramount\u2019s original property in 1980, according to the agency\u2019s website.\n\nMore: 'Westworld' Western set burns down in Southern California's fast-moving Woolsey wildfire\n\nMore: Miley Cyrus, Neil Young, Gerard Butler and more lose homes in California wildfires\n\nMore than 300 films, television shows and commercials have been filmed at the ranch, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nWestern Town was created in the 1950s for television shows such as \u201cThe Cisco Kid.\u201d More recently, in the 1990s, it was the backdrop for \u201cDr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,\u201d according to the National Park Service.\n\nAbout 88 percent of the land within the national park boundary has burned, and within that area sit Western Town and Paramount Ranch.\n\nDavid Szymanski, superintendent of the national recreation area, said the ranch stood for two essential human things that will help motivate the recovery process.\n\n\u201cThe first is story. Story in a simplest form is gossip, but in the form that we\u2019ve come to love, it\u2019s the movie magic,\u201d Szymanski said at the news conference. \u201cAnd we hope to be able to tell the next story of this place in very short order. ... We would like to get Paramount Ranch rebuilt in the next 24 months.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the hope is to get a temporary film set in place so the park can get much-needed revenue from location fees. Those fees also pay for the National Park Service employees who manage the area during filming, said Kate Kuykendall, a spokeswoman for the recreation area.\n\nFor the permanent set, measures will be taken to make it more fire-resistant. The utility infrastructure also needs upgrading, which was already planned, because it dates back to when Paramount owned the property, Szymanski said.\n\nHe said the ranch is also about play. It draws with 400,000 visitors a year and is the site of public and private events such as the Topanga Banjo and Fiddle Festival, as well as an annual party to look at stars and many weddings.\n\nAlthough walls of flame and towering columns of smoke were gone, firefighters continue to expand containment lines around the scorched area. Fire commanders said the 153-square-mile (396-square-kilometer) burn area was 78 percent surrounded.\n\nThe count of destroyed structures reached 713. Another 201 structures were damaged.\n\nLos Angeles County sheriff's detectives were investigating three deaths. Two adults were found in a gutted car last week, and the remains of a person were found Wednesday in the rubble of a home that had burned to the ground.\n\nAt the Paramount Ranch, structures that served as barns, hotels, saloons and barbershops for decades of movies and TV shows are gone. Workers will salvage what they can and then work to rebuild.\n\nThe site began as a set for Paramount Pictures in the 1920s and was taken over by the National Park Service in 1980. It got a major restoration in 1985, with the park service trying to maintain as much as it could from the original buildings. Corrugated tin roofs on many of them still dated to the 1920s. Now those roofs lie burned and twisted on the ground like pieces of a crashed plane.\n\nMore: 'The Bachelor' mansion survives California wildfire 'unscathed'\n\nMore: Pink's husband Carey Hart threatens California wildfire looters 'will be shot on site'\n\nThe park employs a number of youths from underprivileged communities in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, looking to cultivate future leaders. The plan is to continue the program but on a smaller scale, Szymanski said.\n\nA number of issues need to be addressed before the park can open, including the condition of hiking trails, downed power lines and debris left over in Western Town that needs some kind of barrier to close it off.\n\nSome archaeological work may be done within the burned piles because there may be some items worth keeping that date back to when Paramount owned the ranch, Szymanski said.\n\nThe ranch also intersects with land overseen by California State Parks, so both agencies will have to work together to ensure all areas open when it\u2019s safe for visitors to return.\n\nMore: People's Choice Awards go on amid Calif. fires: 'People need entertainment,' says Fallon\n\nMore: Chris Stapleton dedicates CMA win to California wildfire victims\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/11/17/woolsey-fire-paramount-ranch-set-rebuilt-after-destruction/2037876002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Ashley Barry-Biancuzzo", "title": "Black Friday 2018: The best laptop deals on on Apple, Dell, Google, and more", "description": "Shopping for a deal on a laptop on Black Friday?

(Photo: Chris Trotman, Getty Images)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. \u2014 The Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series will crown its 2018 champion on Sunday.\n\nMartin Truex Jr., Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch are each seeking their second titles. Joey Logano, the other Championship 4 driver, will be in the hunt for his first.\n\nThere are no flukes in this group. These drivers rank as the season\u2019s top four in average finish, laps led and top-five finishes. And they have all been in the final four before.\n\nA.J. Perez and Michelle R. Martinelli delve into the prospects for each contender ahead of Sunday\u2019s Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway (2:30 p.m. ET, NBC):\n\nMartin Truex Jr.\n\nStarting position: 3rd\n\nWins in 2018: 4\n\nCareer Cup wins: 19\n\nHighest finish in standings: First (2017)\n\nBest finish at Homestead: First (2017)\n\nWhy Truex will win title: A victory won\u2019t change the fact that Sunday marks the final race for Furniture Row Racing as the team will shutter operations. The No. 78 Toyota team showed it can handle their emotions just fine as last year\u2019s final race and series championship came as team owner Barney Visser recovered from a heart attack.\n\n\u201cIf we can do exactly what we did last year, that would be fine,\u201d Truex said.\n\nWhy he won\u2019t: Truex entered last year\u2019s finale with seven victories and he clinched his spot in the Championship 4 a race earlier than he did this year. Truex\u2019s last win came at Kentucky Speedway in July, the 19th race of the season, so he\u2019s not entering on a role as much this time around.\n\nKyle Busch\n\nStarting position: 2nd\n\nWins in 2018: 8\n\nCareer Cup wins: 51\n\nHighest finish in standings: First (2015)\n\nBest finish at Homestead: First (2015)\n\nWhy Busch will win title: Busch qualified second, although he still came away with the prized No. 1 pit stall. On Saturday, owner Joe Gibbs announced the \"team decision\" to move pole winner and Busch's JGR teammate Denny Hamlin down a few stalls. Busch also enters with the most wins in the playoffs (two) among the Championship 4 and was the series\u2019 regular-season champ. Perhaps just as important, his pit crew has been among the quickest in NASCAR for the past few years, which has allowed him to pick up track positions time and time again.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, you have to have a fast race car,\u201d said Busch, who was edged out last year by Truex at Homestead. \u201cLast year, we were the fastest car. Fastest cars don\u2019t always win the race. You\u2019ve got to have other things go your way. It\u2019s much easier and your job is a lot more calculated if you have that fast car.\u201d\n\nWhy he won\u2019t: Busch has the worst average finish at Homestead among the final four drivers (18.5 in 13 starts).\n\nKevin Harvick\n\nStarting position: 12th\n\nWins in 2018: 8\n\nCareer Cup wins: 45\n\nBest finish in the standings: First (2014)\n\nBest finish at Homestead: First (2014)\n\nWhy Harvick will win title: The No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford has been the fastest car all season: He\u2019s tied for the most wins, is the most efficient passer among the final four and led nearly 20 percent of the season\u2019s total laps. He\u2019s repeatedly shown he can work his way to the front after starting at the back of the field, so having the lowest starting position among the contenders doesn't mean much. Harvick\u2019s talent is obvious as a perennial championship contender, and his team\u2019s chemistry advanced him to this spot and will help him win his second Cup Series championship.\n\n\u201c(Our team has) been together for five years now, and we all work for a great organization that gives us all the resources and things that we need to compete,\u201d Harvick said. \u201cIn the end, you can\u2019t drive a slow car fast and it takes great people to build a fast car.\u201d\n\nWhy he won\u2019t: While the team\u2019s chemistry is key, it will have to win without crew chief Rodney Childers, who NASCAR suspended for two races following a major penalty two weeks ago at Texas Motor Speedway. The team\u2019s success this season is because of his strategy as much as Harvick\u2019s driving, and having backup crew chief Tony Gibson puts this team at a real disadvantage when everyone else is at full strength.\n\nJoey Logano\n\nStarting position: 5th\n\nWins in 2018: 2\n\nCareer Cup wins: 20\n\nBest finish in the standings: Second (2016)\n\nBest finish at Homestead: Fourth (2015, 2016)\n\nWhy Logano will win title: From the speed of the No. 22 Team Penske Ford to Logano\u2019s racing, this team finally found its rhythm. Five of Logano\u2019s 12 top-five finishes this season were in the previous nine playoff races, and he loves the idea of being the outsider facing the Big Three. Plus, because the team qualified for the championship race three weeks ago at Martinsville Speedway, it\u2019s had that much more time to perfect a title-winning car.\n\n\u201cOur cars have been good, our pit crews have been spectacular, driver\u2019s been doing his part, and I think we\u2019re in a good spot to make this happen,\u201d Logano said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few weeks to think about this race, and only this race, and that\u2019s a great advantage to have.\u201d\n\nWhy he won\u2019t: Logano\u2019s success has been sporadic this season with waves of strong finishes sprinkled with mediocre ones, and the Big Three got that nickname because they\u2019re the ones to beat each week with their own unparalleled speed. During the regular season, Logano said everyone else has to be perfect to beat the three dominant drivers, while they can make tiny mistakes and still win. Homestead will be no different.\n\nChampionship picks\n\nA.J. Perez: Busch.\n\nBusch\u2019s hometown of Las Vegas has him even with Harvick as the favorite. Unlike Harvick, Busch will have his crew chief (Adam Stevens). Toss in that No. 1 pit stall and superior pit crew, Busch will get that second title.\n\nMichelle R. Martinelli: Harvick.\n\nIt was clear back in March that Harvick was the car to beat this season, and that\u2019s especially true with a title on the line. After his career-high eight wins this season and 22 top-5 finishes, it would be a disappointing end to have someone other than Harvick hoist that trophy. But he won\u2019t let that happen."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Sarah Kovac, USA TODAY", "title": "Black Friday 2018: The best Kohl's deals on Amazon Echo, Google, and", "description": "These are the best Black Friday deals from Kohl's this year", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/17/black-friday-2018-best-kohls-deals-amazon-echo-google-and-more/38537861/", "urlToImage": "https://media.krem.com/assets/GANNETT/images/522bde07-39ef-4689-b868-b82c9e293da3/522bde07-39ef-4689-b868-b82c9e293da3_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:46:26Z", "content": "Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

Sixty percent of women who will serve next Congress are Girl Scout alums. And Rep.

She is a former U.S. Postal Inspection Service law enforcement officer and undercover Central Intelligence Agency operative, which makes it even more amusing when she jokes: \u201cIf we\u2019re doing booth sales, do I just put a baseball cap on and hope nobody recognizes me?\u201d\n\nNo, serving in Congress won\u2019t require her to go undercover \u2013 again.\n\nWasserman Schultz certainly didn\u2019t have to go incognito when her daughters' troop sold cookies at the Publix or when the girls knocked on doors in the neighborhood. She was right behind them, pulling the wagon of cookies, she said.\n\nMost of her sales were at home, although colleagues and staff would approach her for their cookie fix once word got out that she was a troop leader.\n\n\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t send out any solicitation \u2013 there was nothing like that \u2013 because that wouldn\u2019t be ethical,\u201d she said.\n\nCongressional Management Foundation President Bradford Fitch said, like any boss, members of Congress would need to be careful about selling cookies to their staff, but he didn\u2019t see any ethical violations with them helping their daughters sell to constituents.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nA federal judge has eased the release terms for John W. Hinckley, Jr., the would-be assassin of President Ronald Reagan, permitting him to live on his own or with roommates under tight travel restrictions in Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\nHinckley, 63, has been living at his mother's home in Williamsburg, about 150 miles south of Washington, since his conditional release from St. Elizabeth's hospital in 2016.\n\nThe consent order by U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman on Friday came during a routine update on Hinckley's mental health progress.\n\nFriedman, citing findings of experts and his doctors' reports, said Hinckley \"has been compliant with all the conditions of is release and has remained mentally stable.\"\n\nHinckley was 25 when he wounded Reagan, White House press secretary James Brady, U.S. Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy and D.C. police officer Thomas Delahanty with six shots from a .22-caliber pistol outside a Washington, D.C., hotel.\n\nA jury in 1982 found him not guilty of the assassination because he was deemed legally insane. He was committed to a hospital for the mentally ill.\n\nAuthorities said at the time that he had attacked the president in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster.\n\nThe latest consent order will allow Hinckley to live on his own. He is required to perform volunteer or paid work at least 3 days a week, and keep a daily log of his activities.\n\nHe has reportedly been working part time at a Williamsburg bookstore.\n\nHinckley is restricted to a 75-mile radius of Williamsburg and can travel unaccompanied, but will not be required to have a tracking device on his car. The order, however, does require him to carry a GPS-enabled cell phone whenever he is away from his residence.\n\nAs in the past, Hinckley must submit to regular treatment from a variety of mental health specialists.\n\nThe order allows him to use the Internet but not to search for information about himself, or join any social media sites.\n\nHinckley is banned from having weapons or consuming alcohol or illegal drugs. He must also avoid any contact with the news media, his victims and their families, the U.S. president, and members of Congress.\n\nHinckley attorney Barry Wm. Levine said he hoped the next step would be Hinckley's unconditional release, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cMr. Hinckley is now in his 60s. His mother is 93 or 94 years old. He\u2019s trying to live a good life, trying to salvage what\u2019s left, and to live a regular life like the rest of us.

Russo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nA quick glance at items of interest as NFL Week 11 rolls on \u2026\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Andrew Luck. For all the buzz in the NFL about the hot quarterbacks on the hottest teams, don\u2019t sleep on the progressive rebound of the Colts franchise player. After missing all of last season following the winding rehab from shoulder surgery, Luck\u2019s comeback is cemented by consistency. He\u2019s sparked a resurgence by the Colts (4-5), who can suddenly think of chasing AFC South leader Houston while riding a three-game winning streak. And he\u2019s passed for three TDs in six consecutive games. (Hey, Patrick Mahomes hasn\u2019t even done that). Luck\u2019s 26 TD passes on the season rank second to the young K.C. marvel. With two more TD throws against the Titans on Sunday, Luck would become just the third player in NFL history to pass for 160 TDs in his first 70 games. The first two? Dan Marino (182) and Aaron Rodgers (160). Not a bad reminder that Luck has picked up from where he was pre-injury. Another challenge, though, comes with the visit Sunday from Tennessee, which leads the NFL in scoring defense at 16.8 points a game.\n\nPressure\u2019s on: Doug Pederson and Jim Schwartz. The Eagles (4-5) can still make a run at winning the NFC East, especially with two games on the docket against Washington. But first thing first. The defending Super Bowl champions head into the Superdome trying to derail the hottest team in the NFL. The Saints (8-1) have won eight in a row while averaging an NFL-best 36.6 points a game, and the Philly D is hurting on the back end. The best cornerback, Ronald Darby, suffered a torn ACL last weekend, while nickel back Sidney Jones and corner Jalen Mills are trying to work back from injuries. Sure, injuries are a way of NFL life, and the Eagles won the crown last season despite losing Carson Wentz amid numerous significant setbacks. But this season has also been marked by slow starts from Pederson\u2019s offense and the inability for Schwartz\u2019s D to finish games. And there\u2019s this: Center Jason Kelce maintained the \u201caccountability\u201d that existed last season hasn\u2019t been there. Intended or not, that reflects on Pederson. So, add that to the issues while the \u201creal\u201d Eagles try to re-emerge before it\u2019s too late.\n\nMore: Bojangles or bust: Colts RB Nyheim Hines has unique plan for life after football\n\nMore: 'Be like water': Panthers RB Christian McCaffrey's peaceful flow is key to breakout season\n\nKey matchup: Khalil Mack vs. Kirk Cousins. The NFC North crown could ultimately hinge on which of these key new additions has the better presence when the Vikings visit Soldier Field in the Sunday night showcase. Of course, that\u2019s why Chicago gave up two first-round picks in trading for Mack and why Minnesota guaranteed a record $84 million in luring Cousins. But here\u2019s what might matter most: fumbles. Mack, who has seven sacks in seven games, is tied for the NFL lead with four forced fumbles. Cousins is tied for second in the NFL (with Dak Prescott) with eight fumbles. If he doesn\u2019t hang on to the football, there\u2019s no way the Vikings can keep up with the Bears, whose offense has come to life in recent weeks.\n\nNext man up: Lamar Jackson \u2026 or Robert Griffin III. With Joe Flacco hobbled by a hip injury, the projected heir apparent could make his first NFL start against a Bengals defense that has allowed 500 yards in three consecutive games. Then again, even the status of the potential replacement has twists as Jackson missed Thursday\u2019s practice (as did Flacco) due to a stomach illness. That left RGIII to take all of the reps on Thursday. Hmmm. Perhaps Griffin is a better choice to sub anyway, given that they kept him on the roster as insurance and that the Ravens are desperate with a three-game losing streak. But after trading back into the first round to select Jackson, Baltimore has seemingly itched to get more pop from its \u201cWildcat\u201d with the huge upside. Maybe they start Griffin and increase Jackson\u2019s \u201cWildcat\u201d snaps, then see what flows.\n\nRookie watch: Leighton Vander Esch. The Cowboys\u2019 first-round pick has had a steady progression, pressed into more action by another Sean Lee injury setback. His undeniable breakout game came at Philadelphia on Sunday night when he notched his first NFL pick. His 19 tackles included 13 solo stops. The development alongside second-year pro Jaylon Smith has not only provided Dallas with an inspiring foundation at the linebacker, but to this point also validates why the Cowboys were willing to select him 19th overall while draft analysts had the Boise State product pegged as a second-rounder.\n\nIf the playoffs were today: Houston, 4-12 last season, would have completed a worst-to-first turnaround as AFC South champs. And they\u2019ve gone from worst to first this season, too, as the first NFL team since the 1970 New York Giants (quarterbacked by Fran Tarkenton) to win six consecutive games after starting 0-3. It matters that the centerpiece players, J.J. Watt and Deshaun Watson, have returned to form off major injuries last season. But whom have they played? Washington (6-3) is the first team the Texans (6-3) will face this season with a winning record. Still, given Washington\u2019s injury woes, this might be a classic \u201ctrap\u201d game for Houston.\n\nStomach for an upset: Steelers at Jaguars. As big of a surprise as it was when Jacksonville thumped Big Ben & Co. in Week 5 last season, then ended Pittsburgh\u2019s campaign in the AFC divisional playoffs, it would be more stunning if the Jaguars sprung an upset this time around. The Steelers are rolling with a five-game winning streak, while the Jaguars, carrying a five-game losing streak, are the biggest disappointment in the NFL. What happened? Blake Bortles has regressed. Leonard Fournette, the key difference-maker to watch on Sunday, has missed much of the season with hamstring issues. The defense no longer dominates games. And yes, Jalen Ramsey talks a bit. Then again, what better opponent that the Steelers to challenge the Jaguars to get their groove back.\n\nDid you notice? Falcons safety Damontae Kazee, a second-year pro who stepped into a starting role after Keanu Neal went down for the season in Week 1, leads the NFL with five interceptions. A fifth-round pick from San Diego State, he\u2019s also developed well enough to be entrusted with calling the defensive signals.\n\nStat\u2019s the fact: Sizzling Saints running back Alvin Kamara needs 27 receiving yards to become just the fourth player in NFL history to produce 500 rushing yards and 500 receiving yards in each of their first two seasons. Edgerrin James was last to hit the mark (1999, 2000), joining Herschel Walker (1986-87) and Abner Haynes (1960-61)."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY", "title": "California wildfire wakeup call \u2014 Scan, save and protect now", "description": "In the wake of those massive California fires, we offer a weekend project to make sure you don't lose everything in a disaster.

And if you really want to get anal, we can start digitizing our home movies, and private video and audio collection as well.\n\nYour tools:\n\n(Photo: Apple)\n\nYour phone\n\nThe cheapest option, even though it's lower quality, is to use your camera app to snap photos of both important documents and photos. We like the Google Photo Scan app, which uses software to compensate for scratches and glares in the photo. But if you're serious about backing up your life memories, please opt for the options directly below. Just do the photo scan in a pinch.\n\nGoogle's PhotoScan app takes four photos of your photo, using software to help eliminate glare.

If you're uncomfortable sticking your analog photos into a mailer and shipping them out, visit your local FedEx Office location and ask for the Sony ImageStation machine. You can scan around 100 photos onto a CD for around $5. But you'll have to stand there and do each photo one by one. The bulk scanners are a lot easier and quicker.\n\nSamsung unveiled a 1 terabyte, 1 ounce solid-state hard drive.

But if you're uncomfortable with online storage and being susceptible to potential hacking, this is one alternative \u2014 as long as the drive is placed outside your home, in a safe place. The best deals are on traditional, external hard drives. You can pick up a hefty 4 TB model now for as little as $100. These are the ones that will fail, especially if you move them around. Another idea \u2014 spring for a more expensive, but safer solid state drive, which have no moving parts.

Apple is only for photos and videos; the others can include papers and other documents. You can get free introductory rates from Apple, Google and Microsoft for just a handful of gigabytes, but it won't get you very far. You can pay $1.99 monthly for 100 gigabytes with Google or $3.99 for 200 GB. If you scan all your papers, this approach will work. But if you're adding in your entire photo and video collection, you'll need more space. Look to spend anywhere from $59.99 to around $100 yearly for either 1 or 2 terabytes (that's 1,000 GB) from the main players.\n\nHave questions about the digitizing process? We're here to help.

Patrick Mahomes has been nothing short of sensational in his first year as the starter and Andy Reid and the coaching staff have done a great job putting him in positions to be successful. Mahomes is on a record-setting pace, throwing 31 touchdowns and just seven interceptions thus far.\n\nThey also have a very solid and consistent ground game led by Kareem Hunt, that keeps defenses honest. But the real worry is, of course, the passing game. The Chiefs might have the best array of weapons in the league, with Tyreek Hill, Sammy Watkins, Travis Kelce, and Hunt all being legit threats through the air.\n\nDefending the deep pass has been a major problem for the Rams in recent weeks (looking at you Marcus Peters), and Hill and Watkins are two of the best deep threats in the game. This is a \u201crevenge game\u201d for Peters here, so perhaps he steps his game up, but it certainly won\u2019t be surprising if he\u2019s torched for a few big gains.\n\nThe blueprint Wade Phillips and the Rams\u2019 defense should follow is the one laid by the Cardinals last week. While the Cardinals by no means shut the Chiefs\u2019 offense down, they held Mahomes to his fewest yards of the season and by far his lowest QBR of the season.\n\nThey did this by blitzing a lot and playing a lot of tight press coverage against the Chiefs\u2019 speedy receivers. Granted the Rams don\u2019t have the edge rushers or talent in the secondary that Arizona does, but they should still try something similar. Getting pressure is the only chance this Rams defense has, and if it can get it consistently, it might be able to throw Mahomes off his game. Mahomes\u2019 only other start of the season that wasn\u2019t great came against the Broncos in Denver, who were also able to pressure him, so it\u2019s clear what the Rams need to do.\n\nDefense\n\nThe Chiefs defense has caught a lot of flak this season, and it\u2019s not very good, but it\u2019s also not quite as bad as some have made it seem. Their rushing defense is abysmal, giving up the third-most yards per carry in the league, but defensive coordinator Bob Sutton has made it quite clear that\u2019s mostly by design.\n\nThe run defense has also gotten a little bit better in recent weeks, limiting the Cardinals to just 3.8 yards per rush attempt and the Browns to just 4.1 the week before that. That being said, it\u2019s still the glaring weakness of the unit, and where the Rams will need to attack.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 offense is at its best when Todd Gurley is running well, it sets up the play action Sean McVay loves to run, and Gurley should have plenty of success here. If Gurley can have a big day on the ground, it will let the Rams control the pace of the game and keep Mahomes off the field, which is the key to throwing the Chiefs\u2019 offense off its rhythm.\n\nThe one thing the Chiefs do pretty well is rush the passer. They\u2019re tied for the most sacks in the league with 31, and that could pose some trouble for Jared Goff. Dee Ford and Justin Houston are both very talented pass-rushers, and will be a lot to handle for the Rams\u2019 offensive line.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only talent this Chiefs defense has. They also have defensive tackle Chris Jones, one of the best interior defensive linemen in the league, and Kendall Fuller, one of the best slot cornerbacks in the league. Where the Chiefs really lack talent is at the outside cornerback positions and the safeties.\n\nAssuming Goff has time to throw, he should be easily able to exploit this secondary. Brandin Cooks and Robert Woods will have no problem burning former Cowboys and Redskins castoff Orlando Scandrick on the outside, and all the Rams\u2019 pass catchers should have a big day.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nThis Chiefs team is obviously dangerous and will be extremely hard to beat. That being said, there are ways to attack them on both sides of the ball. The Rams need to get pressure on Mahomes and whether or not they can do that will likely determine the outcome of this game. Kansas City\u2019s defense isn\u2019t as bad as it is made out to be, and their pass-rush could pose serious problems for the Rams\u2019 offense."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Nicole Gaudiano and Eliza Collins, USA TODAY", "title": "Cookie ethics: Congresswoman-elect asks if she's still allowed to sell Girl Scout cookies", "description": "Rep.-elect Abigail Spanberger is one of her daughter\u2019s troop leaders, and as she prepares for her new job representing Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District, she wonders if she has a conflict of interest.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/17/cookie-conundrum-congresswoman-elect-spanberger-frets-over-girl-scout-cookie-season/2018018002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/948b4acc-ca16-49ba-ac5a-14646ad4c996-GTY_1064433240.JPG?crop=5471,3063,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:00:01Z", "content": "Abigail Spanberger, congresswoman-elect in Virginia's 7th District, celebrates with her daughter Clarie and members of her campaign staff on Nov. 6, 2018 in Richmond, Va., after hearing that the Democratic party was on track to regain control of the House of \u2026 [+3302 chars]", "fulltext": "CLOSE Congresswoman-elect Abigail Spanberger is one of her daughter's Girl Scout troop leaders.

Do you know what I mean?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nGiven the sex and financial scandals of Congress, it seems kind of sweet that a member-elect is fretting over the ethics of selling Thin Mints. But it may be the type of issue that\u2019s bound to arise when a record number of women have been elected to Congress.\n\nCookie case law from the House Ethics Committee may be wanting. They\u2019ve never publicly addressed the sale of Girl Scout cookies.\n\nMore: 'Awakening': Abigail Spanberger's House win illustrates the shift of US politics in 'year of the badass woman'\n\nMore: Midterm results 2018: How Trump\u2019s 2016 election set the stage for the female wave\n\nBut if Spanberger needs advice, others have walked this path. Sixty percent of women who will serve next Congress are Girl Scout alums. And Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., balanced her job in Congress with being a troop co-leader from 2006 to 2012.\n\n\u201cI still have the bins and bins of crafts that I collected so that we could always have something ready to go when our meeting came up,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said, laughing.\n\nSpanberger, a Democrat, said it wasn\u2019t a problem in her previous government work to just let colleagues know her daughter was selling them. She is a former U.S. Postal Inspection Service law enforcement officer and undercover Central Intelligence Agency operative, which makes it even more amusing when she jokes: \u201cIf we\u2019re doing booth sales, do I just put a baseball cap on and hope nobody recognizes me?\u201d\n\nNo, serving in Congress won\u2019t require her to go undercover \u2013 again.\n\nWasserman Schultz certainly didn\u2019t have to go incognito when her daughters' troop sold cookies at the Publix or when the girls knocked on doors in the neighborhood. She was right behind them, pulling the wagon of cookies, she said.\n\nMost of her sales were at home, although colleagues and staff would approach her for their cookie fix once word got out that she was a troop leader.\n\n\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t send out any solicitation \u2013 there was nothing like that \u2013 because that wouldn\u2019t be ethical,\u201d she said.\n\nCongressional Management Foundation President Bradford Fitch said, like any boss, members of Congress would need to be careful about selling cookies to their staff, but he didn\u2019t see any ethical violations with them helping their daughters sell to constituents. They just can\u2019t use their post to pressure people to buy cookies.\n\n\u201c(Spanberger) doesn\u2019t relinquish her responsibilities as a mom because she\u2019s a member of Congress,\u201d said Fitch, whose organization advises new members and is involved in their orientation this week in Washington D.C. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a great way to connect with constituents.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/17/cookie-conundrum-congresswoman-elect-spanberger-frets-over-girl-scout-cookie-season/2018018002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Rick Steves, USA TODAY", "title": "Rick Steves: How to book hotels in Europe", "description": "Rick Steves: How to book hotels in Europe", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2018/11/17/europe-hotels/2033367002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.krem.com/assets/GANNETT/images/e6e0403e-cfff-4688-92cb-9712e0d7c6ef/e6e0403e-cfff-4688-92cb-9712e0d7c6ef_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T13:52:21Z", "content": "I used to travel with absolutely no hotel reservations.

(Photo: Dominic Arizona Bonuccelli)\n\nI used to travel with absolutely no hotel reservations. Europe 30 years ago was relatively ramshackle, things were cheaper, and because fewer people could afford to travel for fun, I faced much less competition for budget rooms. I could make decisions on the go, show up in a new town and improvise my accommodations. But the tourism boom and rise of the Internet have changed everything. Today, booking hotels in advance is a critical part of trip planning \u2013 and a fun way to tap into the local scene before you even leave home.\n\nIf flexibility isn't a concern, book your rooms as soon as your itinerary is set. To get my pick of characteristic, family-run hotels in the heart of a town, I reserve several weeks \u2013 or even months \u2013 in advance. It's especially important to reserve as early as possible for stays that fall on holidays, during big festivals and in peak season. In popular cities \u2013 such as London, Paris, Madrid and Venice \u2013 it's smart to book far in advance year-round.\n\nWhile a trusted guidebook remains the best place to start your search for a great place to stay, online tools such as booking sites and user reviews have improved some aspects of hotel hunting. Take advantage of their pluses \u2013 and be wise to their downsides.\n\nBooking sites\n\nHotel booking websites, such as Booking.com and Hotels.com, offer one-stop shopping for hotels. While convenient for travelers, they present a real problem for small, independent, family-run hotels. Without a presence on these sites, these hotels become almost invisible. But to be listed, a hotel must pay a sizable commission ... and promise that its own website won't undercut the price on the booking-service site.\n\nHere's the work-around: Use the big sites to research what's out there, then book direct with the hotel by email or phone, in which case owners are free to give you whatever price they like. I usually ask for a room without the commission mark-up (or for a free breakfast or a free upgrade). Hoteliers are more likely to accommodate any special needs or requests if you're in touch with them directly. If you do book online, be sure to use the hotel's website. The price will likely be the same as via a booking site, but your money goes to the hotel, not to agency commissions.\n\nAs a savvy consumer, remember: When you book with an online booking service, you're adding a middleman who takes roughly 20 percent. To support small, family-run hotels whose world is more difficult than ever, book direct. I prefer that my hardworking hosts pocket the full value of my stay.\n\nUser reviews\n\nUser-generated review sites and apps such as Yelp and TripAdvisor can give you a range of opinions about everything from hotels and restaurants to sights and nightlife. If you scan reviews of a hotel and see several complaints about noise or a rotten location, you've gained insight that can help in your decision-making.\n\nWith any crowdsourcing platform, take the reviews with a grain of salt \u2013 and watch out for fake reviews. Keep in mind that a user-generated review is based on the limited experience of one person, who stayed at just one hotel in a given city and ate at a few restaurants there. Though these evaluations aren't always the most well-informed or objective, they can still be helpful to gauge the amenities, service and quirks of a place. If something is well reviewed in a reliable guidebook \u2013 and it also gets good online reviews \u2013 it's likely a winner.\n\nUser-generated reviews can help you find an authentic, welcoming place in the heart of town \u2014 such as this hotel rooftop in Tangier \u2014 if you know how to sift through a wide variety of opinions. (Photo: Dominic Arizona Bonuccelli)\n\nShort-term rental sites\n\nRental juggernaut Airbnb (along with other short-term rental sites) allows travelers to rent rooms and apartments directly from locals, often providing more value than a cookie-cutter hotel. Airbnb fans appreciate feeling part of a real neighborhood and getting into a daily routine as \"temporary Europeans.\" Depending on the host, staying in an Airbnb can provide an opportunity to get to know a local person, while keeping the money spent on your accommodations in the community.\n\nBut critics view Airbnb as a threat to \"traditional Europe,\" saying it creates unfair, unqualified competition for established guesthouse owners. In some places, the lucrative Airbnb market has forced traditional guesthouses out of business and is driving property values out of range for locals. Some cities have cracked down on the trend \u2013 many now require owners to occupy rental properties part of the year and often stage disruptive \"inspections\" that inconvenience guests.\n\nAs a lover of Europe, I share the worry of those who see residents nudged aside by tourists. But as an advocate for travelers, I appreciate the value and cultural intimacy Airbnb provides.\n\nWith the right online resources, booking ahead is an easy and reliable way to ensure your trip is organized and takes full advantage of Europe's warm hospitality. You'll enjoy the peace of mind of a well-curated itinerary, and when you touch down in Europe, you'll have more time to experience its spontaneous charms.\n\nRick Steves writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.

While she could easily hire someone to handle her errands, she chooses to do them herself: No personal shoppers are working on her behalf. No public relations team is shooing away fans.\n\nSince 2002, when Clarkson won the first season of \"American Idol\" at age 20, she has tried to lead a normal life. It\u2019s not easy considering she has sold more than 25 million albums and 36 million singles. Two of her albums \u2013 \" Breakaway\" and \"Stronger\" \u2013 won Grammys for Best Pop Vocal Album in 2005 and 2012, respectively. She also won the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance trophy in 2005 for \"Since U Been Gone.\"\n\nNow, the 36-year-old Texas native is busy expanding her career. In addition to singing, Clarkson writes children\u2019s books, inspired by her 4-year-old daughter, River Rose. \"River Rose and the Magical Lullaby\" came out in 2016, followed by \"River Rose and the Magical Christmas\" in 2017. She is working on a third volume, as well as a book for young adults.\n\nShe recently voiced Moxy, a character in the 2019 animated film \"UglyDolls,\" based on a line of toys. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for my personality, which is good because I\u2019m not a good actress,\u201d she says. \"It\u2019s one thing I never wanted to do.\u201d\n\nUnscripted Clarkson seems to be a huge hit. She received rave reviews as host of the 2018 Billboard Music Awards, where she promised viewers her authentic self. \u201cYou\u2019re just getting me,\u201d she said at the event. \u201cI\u2019m just going to be who I am.\u201d\n\nFans are expecting the same when she hosts \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" a daytime talk series described as a \u201cweekday brunch party,\u201d debuting in fall 2019.\n\n\u201cI love connecting with people, playing games, music and finding ways to help or give back,\u201d she says about the upcoming show.\n\nThen there\u2019s \"The Voice.\" Given her initial claim to fame, it\u2019s little wonder that Clarkson is serving as a coach and mentor on a singing competition show. She joined Season 14 of the popular NBC series earlier this year and returned for Season 15 in September. When persuading contestants to join her team, Clarkson reminds them that she knows exactly what the singers are going through. \u201cI was the first winner on a show like this, and the pressure is indescribable,\u201d she recalls. \u201cTaking a coaching role seemed like a natural next step.\u201d\n\nOn Season 15, Clarkson works with fellow Idol alumna and returning \"Voice\" coach, Jennifer Hudson and mainstays Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, to help one rising star reach the top.\n\nFrom left, Adam Levine, Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson and Blake Shelton. (Photo: Trae Patton/NBC)\n\n\u201cWhen Kelly came on (Season 14), she really wanted to make her mark, and she did,\u201d says Voice executive producer Audrey Morrissey, who notes that Clarkson\u2019s tutelage helped secure the win for contestant Brynn Cartelli.\n\n\u201cKelly is like a straight-A student. She does her homework. She does everything at 1,000 percent. It\u2019s all about the material and understanding it, finding songs that will show different sides of the artist and keep the audience interested,\u201d Morrissey adds.\n\n\u201dEvery coach does their version of this, but Kelly exceeds in all ways. She\u2019s a fan, an enthusiast and an enthusiast on life. She is what you see. There\u2019s no mystery to her. She\u2019s funny, kindhearted and has a big personality.\u201d\n\nAccording to Clarkson, her candor and transparency have only endeared her to fans. \u201cI don\u2019t see that it gets me in trouble. People are learning that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d says Clarkson, who openly shares with her 15 million social media followers. \u201cA lot of artists are introverts; I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nWhile a lot can be said for her bubbly, warm personality, what music lovers really appreciate is Clarkson\u2019s talent. She\u2019s often ranked among the greatest female voices, appearing on lists with such legends as Whitney Houston and Celine Dion, and peers such as Pink, who once joked, \u201cIf I did a song with Kelly Clarkson, I would get outsung.\u201d\n\nMy December\n\n\"The Voice\" is a welcome addition to the singer\u2019s already busy schedule. \u201cI\u2019ll shift to \"The Voice,\" and then I\u2019ll shift to writing (books),\u201d says Clarkson, who is currently working with her label to determine the direction of her next album.\n\n\u201cI am exhausted, but it\u2019s good exhausted,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019m just getting to the part of my life when if it\u2019s not fun, I don\u2019t exhaust myself. I have less time for bull.\u201d\n\nWith multiple projects \u2013 including her Meaning of Life Tour, launching in January \u2013 pulling her in various directions and requiring her time, the one constant in Clarkson\u2019s life is family, especially during the holidays. That\u2019s when everyone usually gathers at the Nashville, Tennessee, home she shares with husband Brandon Blackstock. \u201cWe have a blended family,\u201d she says. River Rose and Remington Alexander, 2, are her children with Blackstock. Two older children, Savannah, 17, and Seth, 11, are from Blackstock\u2019s first marriage and spend every other Christmas with the family.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m working, I\u2019m pretty adamant that I either wake up with my kids and have breakfast with them, or I put them to bed at night and follow our routine.\u201d Kelly Clarkson\n\n\u201cPeople come from Texas, North Carolina and around the state\u201d to visit for the holidays, she explains. This year might be different as Clarkson recently purchased an $8.5 million mansion in Los Angeles to serve as the family\u2019s base while she tapes \"The Voice.\"\n\n\n\nChristmas with Clarkson usually involves full-on pajamas, big decorations courtesy of her mother-in-law (who is an interior designer), playing games such as Monopoly and Scrabble, roasting marshmallows over a bonfire and family dinner.\n\n\u201cMy sister is actually the cook in our family, but we all pitch in,\u201d she says. \u201cWe also dig watching movies like 'National Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation' or 'Elf.' We have a little theater in our house, so everyone goes down there and gets cocoa.\u201d\n\nClarkson jokes that when it comes to the holidays, her husband reminds her of Clark Griswold of \"Christmas Vacation.\"\n\n\u201cI married the movie version of Chevy Chase,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have the most lights.\u201d\n\nMeaning of Life\n\nClarkson and Blackstock, 41, met in 2006 at the Country Music Awards Fest. She was performing a song with Rascal Flatts, and Blackstock was the group\u2019s tour manager. They met again six years later at the Super Bowl, where Clarkson was singing the national anthem. One thing led to another, and they married a year later.\n\n\u201cMy husband manages me, and we definitely disagree sometimes,\u201d Clarkson says about their working relationship. \u201cI\u2019m not really good at time management, and I\u2019m always putting everybody before me. He\u2019s good at helping me with that. I\u2019m good at helping him see outside what a manager sees.\u201d\n\nAnd when they disagree? \u201cIf it comes down to art, not our marriage, obviously I have the last say,\u201d Clarkson says. \u201cBut I was raised to think two heads are better than one. Whenever I think I\u2019m completely right, usually it\u2019s just an opinion.\u201d\n\nOne year after they married, River Rose was born. The responsibilities of motherhood changed Clarkson\u2019s life. \u201cI\u2019ve always been confident, now I\u2019m more so,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a tough mom. I love fiercely, but I discipline just as much.\u201d\n\nClarkson makes sure she spends time each day with her children. \u201cWhen I\u2019m working, I\u2019m pretty adamant that I either wake up with my kids and have breakfast with them, or I put them to bed at night and follow our routine. I need to do this for them but also for me. I suffer from abandonment issues,\u201d she says.\n\nMore: 'UglyDolls' first trailer: Watch Kelly Clarkson's wonderfully weird Moxy in animated movie\n\nMore: Kelly Clarkson officially launching a daytime talk show\n\nClarkson\u2019s parents divorced when she was 6. The youngest of three, she grew up with her mother, her older sister, Alyssa, was raised by an aunt, and her brother, Jason, lived with their father. Clarkson never really reconnected with her father and wrote about the estrangement in two songs, \"Piece by Piece\" and \"Because of You.\"\n\nHer fractured early life taught her the importance of being there for her children. \u201cI have a great job, but family comes first,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to feel the \u2018guilties,\u2019 especially with my first child. If I missed something and my nanny was there, I\u2019d say to myself, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a bad mom.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter reflecting on her upbringing, Clarkson\u2019s perspective started to change, and she eased up on herself. Although her mother was rarely home as she worked hard to provide for her daughter, Clarkson says she learned a lot from her mom and \u201cturned out great.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe taught me to work my ass off. You\u2019ve got to be willing to be tired and work for it. I want to instill that in my kids. Also, I\u2019ve learned to let go and to allow people to help.\u201d\n\nClarkson\u2018s mother also kept her on track toward realizing her dream.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to just enjoy yourself and quit worrying if you\u2019re on top and people are digging you,\" Kelly Clarkson says. \"Today you might be cool, but tomorrow it will be somebody else.\u201d (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cWhen I started singing as a kid, she would say, \u2018You won\u2019t be able to sing at events if you don\u2019t do this.\u2019 My room was always clean then. She had something on me because it was a dream of mine.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a parenting strategy Clarkson uses today with her teenage daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s an equestrian. She has a very expensive dream and if she messes up, that goes away.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t rush\n\nWith 15 years in the music industry, Clarkson is aware that popularity ebbs and flows, but she\u2019s not focused on staying in the limelight. \u201cI\u2019m so not that kind of planner,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to just enjoy yourself and quit worrying if you\u2019re on top and people are digging you. Today you might be cool, but tomorrow it will be somebody else.\u201d\n\nWith her role on \"The Voice,\" Clarkson may be helping train and mentor the next big star.

The familiarity of favorite carols, Nana\u2019s homemade desserts, the neighbor\u2019s holiday lights and the huge Christmas tree that nightly illuminates the town square are customs many look forward to year after year.\n\nNo matter the combination of yuletide elements that conjures up the holiday spirit for you, chances are, the Hallmark Channel has an original made-for-TV film that captures that same feeling.\n\nThis year, Hallmark Channel\u2019s annual Countdown to Christmas holiday movie event began Oct. 27 and ends on New Year\u2019s Day. In total, the network will air 22 original films during that monthslong period, and its sister channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, will air a dozen during its Miracles of Christmas programming, which started Oct. 26 and also ends Jan. 1.\n\nLike Grandma\u2019s family recipe, the marathon of movies has become a holiday tradition for many. For the past nine years, the event has perpetually grown, offering films that vary in plot, but all have something in common.\n\n\u201cWe look for each of our stories to celebrate the season and deliver on the essence and spirit of Christmas,\u201d says Michelle Vicary, executive vice president of Crown Media Family Networks. \u201cOur promise is to make viewers feel better.\u201d\n\nTime and Talent\n\nThe nightly holiday-themed premieres roll out over two months, but for network executives, it\u2019s a yearlong process, according to Vicary. \u201cOur talent is already asking about what movies they\u2019re going to get in 2019,\u201d she said in June. \u201cWe already have some opportunities that have gone into development. We have talent, writers and producers; 2019 is in process for sure.\u201d\n\nThe films draw several stars from popular \u201980s and \u201990s TV series \u2014 familiar faces, such as Melissa Joan Hart, Candace Cameron Bure, Danica McKellar and Lacey Chabert, who portrays Darcy Fitzwilliam in Hallmark\u2019s Pride, Prejudice and Mistletoe, airing Nov. 23.\n\nLacey Chabert stars in the Hallmark Channel holiday movie \"Pride, Prejudice and Mistletoe.\" (Photo: PROVIDED BY HALLMARK CHANNEL)\n\n\u201cIt takes some imagination to film a Christmas movie in the summer months when the fake snow is melting on set,\u201d says Chabert, who has starred in seven Hallmark holiday movies.\n\n\u201cThey love working with us,\u201d says Vicary of the repeat actors. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want to make a No. 1 movie on television?\u201d\n\nSuccess Story\n\nDuring the months the original movies air, Hallmark ranks high in U.S. households, the network reports. \u201cWe are No. 1 all fourth quarter,\u201d says Vicary.\n\n\u201cWe have 82 million people come and watch the channel at least once during the Countdown to Christmas and Miracles of Christmas events,\u201d she adds, citing viewership data from 2017.\n\nHallmark Movies & Mysteries ranked No. 9 among households during that time period.\n\nAccording to the network, 48 million women watched movies on both Hallmark networks during last year\u2019s events.\n\nAlthough the audience of the often sugary-sweet movies, many that fit into the rom-com category, is comprised of mostly women, men tune in, too. In 2017, 34 million men watched.\n\nRob Bricken says he first learned of the movie marathons years ago, thanks to ads airing while he watched Golden Girls reruns. However, it wasn\u2019t until last year, that he and his wife, Loree Stark, decided to recap each movie and launch the A Very Hallmark Christmas podcast.\n\nA Very Hallmark Christmas podcast (Photo: Provided by Rob Bricken)\n\nDuring Countdown to Christmas, they watch every premiere and immediately post their commentary on the films.\n\n\u201cThere was one time period over Thanksgiving where we watched Hallmark movies 11 days in a row because that\u2019s how many new releases there were,\u201d says Stark, whose favorite 2017 film was Christmas in Angel Falls, starring Rachel Boston as a guardian angel. Bricken most enjoyed Christmas Getaway with Bridget Regan as a travel writer who ends up spending the holiday with a handsome man.\n\nAlthough Vicary, who has been with the network for nearly 20 years, may not have foreseen viewers podcasting about the movies, she says she always had high expectations for the franchise. \u201cWe endeavored to be this big. We come at this with a spirit of hopefulness that we will do as well as we set out to. We learn from any mistakes we make, but largely we understand what our audience wants, and we love to give them what they expect.\u201d\n\nWinning Formula\n\nWhen it comes to meeting viewers\u2019 expectations, Hallmark films follow a formula that is rather clich\u00e9 for TV. Within moments of the opening scene, which usually involves snow falling in a quaint little town, a woman begrudgingly returning home for the holidays or a heroine lamenting her failed love life \u2014 most viewers can practically write the scripts.\n\nFor the actor, that means finding enough distinctions between the similar characters and storylines to bring something unique to each film.\n\n\u201cI look for a different nuance in the characters I play and bring a different flavor,\u201d says Chabert, who understands that the predictability is part of the films\u2019 appeal.\n\nCouple enjoys TV program during the holidays (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe thing I love most about the movies and the thing I find most fans always point out, is not only is there always a happy ending, but they\u2019re focused around tradition, bringing families together and capturing the holiday spirit in the main character. I love those messages,\u201d says Chabert. \u201cIt\u2019s the comfort of knowing what lies\n\nahead, and it\u2019s going to be heartwarming.\u201d\n\nChabert\u2019s efforts to break the monotony have paid off, according to Bricken. \u201cI\u2019ve been fascinated by how much variance the movies have despite being forced to follow a pretty simple formula,\u201d he says. \u201cThese movies can be genuinely funny or truly awful or completely insane, all while hitting the same story beats.\u201d\n\nVicary points out that many American film classics are predictable (not only did we know Jack and Rose would fall in love, we knew the Titanic would sink!) and she has no problem being in the company of those favorites.\n\n\u201cThe first time you see them on screen, you know they get together,\u201d she says of the couples who fall in love by the end of most of the films. For viewers, it\u2019s the journey they enjoy, Vicary explains. \u201cOur team endeavors to make that interesting and fun, and the ratings surely bear out the fact that they continue to tune in with the knowledge that they\u2019re going to feel good and great people are going to end up together.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bricken notes that it\u2019s not just the storylines that are predictable, as the characters have more than just Christmas cheer in common: A large majority of the films feature white actors \u2014 a lack of diversity for which the network has been criticized.\n\n\u201cNot only is there always a happy ending, but they\u2019re focused around tradition, bringing families together and capturing the holiday spirit in the main character. I love those messages.\u201d Lacey Chabert, actress\n\n\u201cYou know what you\u2019re getting and that the heterosexual white couple will get together in the end,\u201d Bricken says.\n\nLast year, Hallmark\u2019s Enchanted Christmas starred husband-and-wife duo Carlos and Alexa PenaVega, who are of Latino descent. Black actresses Holly Robinson Peete and Sheryl Lee Ralph have co-starred in recent Hallmark holiday movies, and the network is hoping to do more to represent the country\u2019s diversity.\n\nThis year, Peete, Tia Mowry-Hardrict, Jerrika Hinton, Christina Milian and Tatyana Ali star in Hallmark holiday movies. The PenaVegas each headline films airing in December.\n\n\u201cWe want more diversity in our lead roles and are actively going after some of the leading actors and actresses in the world,\u201d says Vicary. \u201cWe still need to do more,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe overindex in diversity in executive producers, writers, directors and even the top leadership of Crown Media. ... We are deeply committed to making our programming more diverse.\u201d\n\nAlthough other networks premiere original holiday movies, Vicary says the Hallmark brand demands a certain standard.\n\n\u201cOur formula is to treat each movie \u2014 even though there are a lot of them \u2014 as though it\u2019s the No. 1 we\u2019re making for the season. That\u2019s the charge we give to each of our development executives. We don\u2019t have wiggle room to do anything other than bring the highest quality,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s not something somebody else can replicate.\u201d\n\nTrending Tradition\n\nChabert says her family usually spends Christmas in pajamas, enjoying hot cocoa, opening presents and watching movies. \u201cGrowing up, we watched Christmas Vacation every year. Now, there are a ton of Hallmark movies we can add to the list.\u201d\n\nThe annual marathon events have already become a part of Bricken\u2019s holiday traditions, and not just because of the podcast.\n\nMore: With Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas 2018, love and Kellie Pickler are coming to town\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t generally consider myself particularly that into the holidays, although that started to change a bit the more I watched Hallmark,\u201d he says. \u201cWe ended up purchasing one of the artificial trees that is featured in almost every Hallmark movie after not having a tree for years and years.\u201d\n\nJust like its greeting cards and keepsake ornaments, Hallmark\u2019s movies have made a place in American pop culture, and like that special family recipe Grandma contributes each year, they\u2019re something viewers look forward to when the holidays roll around.\n\n\u201cWe owe our success to the 108-year-old legacy of one of the world\u2019s finest brands,\u201d Vicary says. \u201cWe are grateful, but not surprised to be such an integral part of families\u2019 traditions at the holidays.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY's 2018 Modern Woman Magazine (Photo: Studio Gannett)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/11/17/hallmark-holiday-movies/2011038002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Susan Tompor, Detroit Free Press", "title": "How to get $100,000 or more in your 401(k) by your 30s", "description": "How millennials can save $100K in their 401(k)", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2018/11/17/401-k-tips-millennials-how-save-retirement-planning/2012686002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/208ab352-504a-4840-a2b9-d375f53822e9/208ab352-504a-4840-a2b9-d375f53822e9_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T13:05:25Z", "content": "So, you don't even have a clue on how your 401(k) is invested ?

For the first time, more than half of all 401(k) accounts, or 50.4 percent, now hold all of their retirement savings in a set-it-and-forget-it target-date fund \u2013 a collection of ready-mixed investments selected based on the year you'd expect to retire, according to a tally of 401(k) accounts at Fidelity Investments.\n\nThe mix of stocks and bonds are automatically readjusted based on the year that's closest to your expected date of retirement. The mix trends more toward bonds than stocks as you age.\n\nA trillion dollars in a targeted mix\n\nAssets in target-date funds hit $1 trillion in 2017 \u2013 up from a mere $158 billion at the end of 2008, according to Morningstar's latest annual report on what it called the \"Increasingly Passive Giant.\"\n\nYounger savers are even more dependent on this hey-you-do-it-for-me hack.\n\nAbout 68 percent of millennials on Fidelity's 401(k) platform have all of their money in the plan invested in a prepackaged target-date fund. That means many may have never, ever made a decision on how much money to put into international funds, growth funds, value funds, junk bonds or anything else.\n\nHow can that many people simply ignore how they're saving their money in a 401(k)? Well, it's not as shocking as one might think.\n\nMore: Hollywood can inspire you to save more in your 401(k) for retirement\n\nWe're looking at the default pick for the vast majority of 401(k) plans \u2013 especially among plans that automatically enroll new employees. So if your company automatically enrolls you in its 401(k) plan \u2013 and you don't select how to invest the money \u2013 then the default is a target-date fund based on your age.\n\n\"What that results in is a large number of people being defaulted in target-date funds,\" said Christopher Jones, chief investment officer for Financial Engines.\n\nJones said the target-date funds aren't necessarily a bad idea for younger workers in their mid-20s or 30s. After all, someone who is decades from retirement has plenty of room to take risk and doesn't want that money parked in a low-risk, low-return money market fund or a stable value fund.\n\nMillennials are making money\n\nMore good news for millennials: The average balance for millennials who have been in their plan for five years in a row hit $82,000 in the third quarter, according to Fidelity's data. That compares with $26,600 for millennials overall.\n\nThe average age for millennials with those higher balances and five years in a plan was 33.5 years old. About 45.8 percent of that group had all of their money in a target-date fund.\n\nMore: How to max out your retirement savings in 2019\n\nOne key factor in success for millennials: They keep saving money each year. The average 12-month contribution amount was $6,940 for those who were five years in the plan. That compares with generally younger millennials who contributed an average of $4,520 a year.\n\n\"They're making an effort each year to stay in the plans,\" said Katie Taylor, vice president of thought leadership at Fidelity.\n\nMany millennials who hold larger balances in their 401(k) plans, she said, tend to have a higher-than-average income.\n\nMillennials in that group with an average of $82,000 in their 401(k) plans had an average income of $92,000. That compared with an average income of $74,900 for millennial savers overall, according to Fidelity.\n\nWhen it comes to building up sizable savings for retirement, employees who do well often benefit from being able stay with one employer for several years, receiving a good company match on their contributions and aiming to save more than 10 percent of their pay, Jones said.\n\nFor example, Fidelity noted the average balance for all workers who have been in their 401(k) plan for five years straight reached $221,000 in the third quarter. The average balance for workers who have been in their plan for 10 years reached $305,400.\n\nOne mistake to avoid: Too often, an employee who leaves a company to change jobs will cash out of the 401(k) and take the tax hit.\n\n\"They'll just go out and spend it,\" he said.\n\nAll target-date funds are not the same\n\nYounger savers who invest in target-date funds have no doubt gotten a boost from the strong bull market for stocks. The basket of funds generally carries more domestic and international stocks when you're in your 20s or 30s than if you're in your 60s.\n\nSay you planned to retire in 30 years. The Fidelity Freedom Fund 2050 would have a mix of 63 percent domestic stock funds, 27 percent international equity funds and 10 percent bond fund.\n\nMore: Your employer doesn't offer a 401(k) plan? There are still ways to save for retirement\n\nSay you planned to retire in five years. The Fidelity Freedom Fund 2025 would have a mix of 42 percent domestic stock funds, 18 percent international equity funds, 36 percent bond funds and 3 percent short-term funds.\n\nBut there are reasons to think twice about investing blindly:\n\nAll target-date funds don't take on the same level of risk, even for people of the same age.\n\nWhile fees have been trending down, some target-date funds have way higher fees than others.\n\nAnd if you've got a lifetime of savings on the line, you might want more control over your investments as you near retirement. You also may have other financial challenges, as you age, where you'd want to consider a more conservative or more aggressive portfolio.\n\nGranted, the bulk of the money in 401(k) plans is not in target-date funds. Just over 30 percent of all 401(k) assets are in target-date funds, according to Fidelity. That's up from 9.8 percent of overall assets 10 years ago.\n\nWatch your fees\n\nCost, of course, is key as you're trying to save money toward retirement. The least expensive option, generally, can be a target-date series that invests primarily in index funds, according to Morningstar.\n\nThe average asset-weighted expense ratio for target-date funds fell to 0.66 percent at the end of 2017, a notable decrease from 0.91 percent just five years earlier, according to Morningstar.\n\nWatch your risk\n\nRisk is another issue. Sometimes, the investment community is more bearish on certain pieces in the target-date mix, such as the worries about a weak global economy, a trade war and the impact on international funds. Or fear of rapidly rising interest rates would make some more bearish on some bond funds.\n\nBut your money would continue to be invested in those areas based on your target date of retirement.\n\nWatch performance\n\nPerformance matters, as well. The Morningstar report noted that while some newer lower-cost target-date offerings have been popular, some have not produced better performance results than older, more-costly target-date funds.\n\nThe Pension Protection Act of 2006 enabled employers to make it easier for workers to enroll in 401(k) plans by doing it for them. Many times, employees don't opt out when you opt in for them. The act also gave the green light to the use of target-date funds as a qualified default investment.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, about 34 percent of Fidelity plans had an auto enrollment feature \u2013 more than double the percentage than 10 years ago.\n\nGiving more proof to the auto-enrollment twist, Fidelity notes that 51 percent of all \"new\" 401(k) contributions go into a target-date fund.\n\nVanguard ranks No. 1 with $381.5 billion in total assets in target-date funds in 2017; Fidelity ranked No. 2 with $227.5 billion in total assets in target-date funds, according to Morningstar. David Blanchett, head of retirement research for Morningstar Investment Management in Chicago, said target-date funds are an improvement for many savers who struggled with building their own portfolio.\n\n\"They significantly simplify the investment decision process and I think will definitely result in better retirement outcomes for investors,\" Blanchett said.\n\nYet he warns that target-date funds aren't a perfect solution because individuals face their own challenges and preferences.\n\nNot paying attention may mean you're taking on more risk than you're prepared to take.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876.

(Photo: Dominic Arizona Bonuccelli)\n\nI used to travel with absolutely no hotel reservations. Europe 30 years ago was relatively ramshackle, things were cheaper, and because fewer people could afford to travel for fun, I faced much less competition for budget rooms. I could make decisions on the go, show up in a new town and improvise my accommodations. But the tourism boom and rise of the Internet have changed everything. Today, booking hotels in advance is a critical part of trip planning \u2013 and a fun way to tap into the local scene before you even leave home.\n\nIf flexibility isn't a concern, book your rooms as soon as your itinerary is set. To get my pick of characteristic, family-run hotels in the heart of a town, I reserve several weeks \u2013 or even months \u2013 in advance. It's especially important to reserve as early as possible for stays that fall on holidays, during big festivals and in peak season. In popular cities \u2013 such as London, Paris, Madrid and Venice \u2013 it's smart to book far in advance year-round.\n\nWhile a trusted guidebook remains the best place to start your search for a great place to stay, online tools such as booking sites and user reviews have improved some aspects of hotel hunting. Take advantage of their pluses \u2013 and be wise to their downsides.\n\nBooking sites\n\nHotel booking websites, such as Booking.com and Hotels.com, offer one-stop shopping for hotels. While convenient for travelers, they present a real problem for small, independent, family-run hotels. Without a presence on these sites, these hotels become almost invisible. But to be listed, a hotel must pay a sizable commission ... and promise that its own website won't undercut the price on the booking-service site.\n\nHere's the work-around: Use the big sites to research what's out there, then book direct with the hotel by email or phone, in which case owners are free to give you whatever price they like. I usually ask for a room without the commission mark-up (or for a free breakfast or a free upgrade). Hoteliers are more likely to accommodate any special needs or requests if you're in touch with them directly. If you do book online, be sure to use the hotel's website. The price will likely be the same as via a booking site, but your money goes to the hotel, not to agency commissions.\n\nAs a savvy consumer, remember: When you book with an online booking service, you're adding a middleman who takes roughly 20 percent. To support small, family-run hotels whose world is more difficult than ever, book direct. I prefer that my hardworking hosts pocket the full value of my stay.\n\nUser reviews\n\nUser-generated review sites and apps such as Yelp and TripAdvisor can give you a range of opinions about everything from hotels and restaurants to sights and nightlife. If you scan reviews of a hotel and see several complaints about noise or a rotten location, you've gained insight that can help in your decision-making.\n\nWith any crowdsourcing platform, take the reviews with a grain of salt \u2013 and watch out for fake reviews. Keep in mind that a user-generated review is based on the limited experience of one person, who stayed at just one hotel in a given city and ate at a few restaurants there. Though these evaluations aren't always the most well-informed or objective, they can still be helpful to gauge the amenities, service and quirks of a place. If something is well reviewed in a reliable guidebook \u2013 and it also gets good online reviews \u2013 it's likely a winner.\n\nUser-generated reviews can help you find an authentic, welcoming place in the heart of town \u2014 such as this hotel rooftop in Tangier \u2014 if you know how to sift through a wide variety of opinions. (Photo: Dominic Arizona Bonuccelli)\n\nShort-term rental sites\n\nRental juggernaut Airbnb (along with other short-term rental sites) allows travelers to rent rooms and apartments directly from locals, often providing more value than a cookie-cutter hotel. Airbnb fans appreciate feeling part of a real neighborhood and getting into a daily routine as \"temporary Europeans.\" Depending on the host, staying in an Airbnb can provide an opportunity to get to know a local person, while keeping the money spent on your accommodations in the community.\n\nBut critics view Airbnb as a threat to \"traditional Europe,\" saying it creates unfair, unqualified competition for established guesthouse owners. In some places, the lucrative Airbnb market has forced traditional guesthouses out of business and is driving property values out of range for locals. Some cities have cracked down on the trend \u2013 many now require owners to occupy rental properties part of the year and often stage disruptive \"inspections\" that inconvenience guests.\n\nAs a lover of Europe, I share the worry of those who see residents nudged aside by tourists. But as an advocate for travelers, I appreciate the value and cultural intimacy Airbnb provides.\n\nWith the right online resources, booking ahead is an easy and reliable way to ensure your trip is organized and takes full advantage of Europe's warm hospitality. You'll enjoy the peace of mind of a well-curated itinerary, and when you touch down in Europe, you'll have more time to experience its spontaneous charms.\n\nRick Steves writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.

(Photo: ART STREIBER/NBC)\n\nW hen Grammy Award-winning singer Kelly Clarkson is enjoying a day off, she is just another mother of four kids completing chores in her free time. While she could easily hire someone to handle her errands, she chooses to do them herself: No personal shoppers are working on her behalf. No public relations team is shooing away fans.\n\nSince 2002, when Clarkson won the first season of \"American Idol\" at age 20, she has tried to lead a normal life. It\u2019s not easy considering she has sold more than 25 million albums and 36 million singles. Two of her albums \u2013 \" Breakaway\" and \"Stronger\" \u2013 won Grammys for Best Pop Vocal Album in 2005 and 2012, respectively. She also won the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance trophy in 2005 for \"Since U Been Gone.\"\n\nNow, the 36-year-old Texas native is busy expanding her career. In addition to singing, Clarkson writes children\u2019s books, inspired by her 4-year-old daughter, River Rose. \"River Rose and the Magical Lullaby\" came out in 2016, followed by \"River Rose and the Magical Christmas\" in 2017. She is working on a third volume, as well as a book for young adults.\n\nShe recently voiced Moxy, a character in the 2019 animated film \"UglyDolls,\" based on a line of toys. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for my personality, which is good because I\u2019m not a good actress,\u201d she says. \"It\u2019s one thing I never wanted to do.\u201d\n\nUnscripted Clarkson seems to be a huge hit. She received rave reviews as host of the 2018 Billboard Music Awards, where she promised viewers her authentic self. \u201cYou\u2019re just getting me,\u201d she said at the event. \u201cI\u2019m just going to be who I am.\u201d\n\nFans are expecting the same when she hosts \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" a daytime talk series described as a \u201cweekday brunch party,\u201d debuting in fall 2019.\n\n\u201cI love connecting with people, playing games, music and finding ways to help or give back,\u201d she says about the upcoming show.\n\nThen there\u2019s \"The Voice.\" Given her initial claim to fame, it\u2019s little wonder that Clarkson is serving as a coach and mentor on a singing competition show. She joined Season 14 of the popular NBC series earlier this year and returned for Season 15 in September. When persuading contestants to join her team, Clarkson reminds them that she knows exactly what the singers are going through. \u201cI was the first winner on a show like this, and the pressure is indescribable,\u201d she recalls. \u201cTaking a coaching role seemed like a natural next step.\u201d\n\nOn Season 15, Clarkson works with fellow Idol alumna and returning \"Voice\" coach, Jennifer Hudson and mainstays Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, to help one rising star reach the top.\n\nFrom left, Adam Levine, Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson and Blake Shelton. (Photo: Trae Patton/NBC)\n\n\u201cWhen Kelly came on (Season 14), she really wanted to make her mark, and she did,\u201d says Voice executive producer Audrey Morrissey, who notes that Clarkson\u2019s tutelage helped secure the win for contestant Brynn Cartelli.\n\n\u201cKelly is like a straight-A student. She does her homework. She does everything at 1,000 percent. It\u2019s all about the material and understanding it, finding songs that will show different sides of the artist and keep the audience interested,\u201d Morrissey adds.\n\n\u201dEvery coach does their version of this, but Kelly exceeds in all ways. She\u2019s a fan, an enthusiast and an enthusiast on life. She is what you see. There\u2019s no mystery to her. She\u2019s funny, kindhearted and has a big personality.\u201d\n\nAccording to Clarkson, her candor and transparency have only endeared her to fans. \u201cI don\u2019t see that it gets me in trouble. People are learning that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d says Clarkson, who openly shares with her 15 million social media followers. \u201cA lot of artists are introverts; I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nWhile a lot can be said for her bubbly, warm personality, what music lovers really appreciate is Clarkson\u2019s talent. She\u2019s often ranked among the greatest female voices, appearing on lists with such legends as Whitney Houston and Celine Dion, and peers such as Pink, who once joked, \u201cIf I did a song with Kelly Clarkson, I would get outsung.\u201d\n\nMy December\n\n\"The Voice\" is a welcome addition to the singer\u2019s already busy schedule. \u201cI\u2019ll shift to \"The Voice,\" and then I\u2019ll shift to writing (books),\u201d says Clarkson, who is currently working with her label to determine the direction of her next album.\n\n\u201cI am exhausted, but it\u2019s good exhausted,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019m just getting to the part of my life when if it\u2019s not fun, I don\u2019t exhaust myself. I have less time for bull.\u201d\n\nWith multiple projects \u2013 including her Meaning of Life Tour, launching in January \u2013 pulling her in various directions and requiring her time, the one constant in Clarkson\u2019s life is family, especially during the holidays. That\u2019s when everyone usually gathers at the Nashville, Tennessee, home she shares with husband Brandon Blackstock. \u201cWe have a blended family,\u201d she says. River Rose and Remington Alexander, 2, are her children with Blackstock. Two older children, Savannah, 17, and Seth, 11, are from Blackstock\u2019s first marriage and spend every other Christmas with the family.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m working, I\u2019m pretty adamant that I either wake up with my kids and have breakfast with them, or I put them to bed at night and follow our routine.\u201d Kelly Clarkson\n\n\u201cPeople come from Texas, North Carolina and around the state\u201d to visit for the holidays, she explains. This year might be different as Clarkson recently purchased an $8.5 million mansion in Los Angeles to serve as the family\u2019s base while she tapes \"The Voice.\"\n\n\n\nChristmas with Clarkson usually involves full-on pajamas, big decorations courtesy of her mother-in-law (who is an interior designer), playing games such as Monopoly and Scrabble, roasting marshmallows over a bonfire and family dinner.\n\n\u201cMy sister is actually the cook in our family, but we all pitch in,\u201d she says. \u201cWe also dig watching movies like 'National Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation' or 'Elf.' We have a little theater in our house, so everyone goes down there and gets cocoa.\u201d\n\nClarkson jokes that when it comes to the holidays, her husband reminds her of Clark Griswold of \"Christmas Vacation.\"\n\n\u201cI married the movie version of Chevy Chase,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have the most lights.\u201d\n\nMeaning of Life\n\nClarkson and Blackstock, 41, met in 2006 at the Country Music Awards Fest. She was performing a song with Rascal Flatts, and Blackstock was the group\u2019s tour manager. They met again six years later at the Super Bowl, where Clarkson was singing the national anthem. One thing led to another, and they married a year later.\n\n\u201cMy husband manages me, and we definitely disagree sometimes,\u201d Clarkson says about their working relationship. \u201cI\u2019m not really good at time management, and I\u2019m always putting everybody before me. He\u2019s good at helping me with that. I\u2019m good at helping him see outside what a manager sees.\u201d\n\nAnd when they disagree? \u201cIf it comes down to art, not our marriage, obviously I have the last say,\u201d Clarkson says. \u201cBut I was raised to think two heads are better than one. Whenever I think I\u2019m completely right, usually it\u2019s just an opinion.\u201d\n\nOne year after they married, River Rose was born. The responsibilities of motherhood changed Clarkson\u2019s life. \u201cI\u2019ve always been confident, now I\u2019m more so,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a tough mom. I love fiercely, but I discipline just as much.\u201d\n\nClarkson makes sure she spends time each day with her children. \u201cWhen I\u2019m working, I\u2019m pretty adamant that I either wake up with my kids and have breakfast with them, or I put them to bed at night and follow our routine. I need to do this for them but also for me. I suffer from abandonment issues,\u201d she says.\n\nMore: 'UglyDolls' first trailer: Watch Kelly Clarkson's wonderfully weird Moxy in animated movie\n\nMore: Kelly Clarkson officially launching a daytime talk show\n\nClarkson\u2019s parents divorced when she was 6. The youngest of three, she grew up with her mother, her older sister, Alyssa, was raised by an aunt, and her brother, Jason, lived with their father. Clarkson never really reconnected with her father and wrote about the estrangement in two songs, \"Piece by Piece\" and \"Because of You.\"\n\nHer fractured early life taught her the importance of being there for her children. \u201cI have a great job, but family comes first,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to feel the \u2018guilties,\u2019 especially with my first child. If I missed something and my nanny was there, I\u2019d say to myself, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a bad mom.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter reflecting on her upbringing, Clarkson\u2019s perspective started to change, and she eased up on herself. Although her mother was rarely home as she worked hard to provide for her daughter, Clarkson says she learned a lot from her mom and \u201cturned out great.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe taught me to work my ass off. You\u2019ve got to be willing to be tired and work for it. I want to instill that in my kids. Also, I\u2019ve learned to let go and to allow people to help.\u201d\n\nClarkson\u2018s mother also kept her on track toward realizing her dream.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to just enjoy yourself and quit worrying if you\u2019re on top and people are digging you,\" Kelly Clarkson says. \"Today you might be cool, but tomorrow it will be somebody else.\u201d (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cWhen I started singing as a kid, she would say, \u2018You won\u2019t be able to sing at events if you don\u2019t do this.\u2019 My room was always clean then. She had something on me because it was a dream of mine.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a parenting strategy Clarkson uses today with her teenage daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s an equestrian. She has a very expensive dream and if she messes up, that goes away.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t rush\n\nWith 15 years in the music industry, Clarkson is aware that popularity ebbs and flows, but she\u2019s not focused on staying in the limelight. \u201cI\u2019m so not that kind of planner,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to just enjoy yourself and quit worrying if you\u2019re on top and people are digging you. Today you might be cool, but tomorrow it will be somebody else.\u201d\n\nWith her role on \"The Voice,\" Clarkson may be helping train and mentor the next big star. That prospect might affect some celebrities\u2019 egos, but Clarkson approaches any changes with gratitude.\n\n\u201cI was just talking to Gwen Stefani (who served as a Voice coach for three seasons) about this the other night. We had dinner at her house,\u201d Clarkson says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother either one of us. We\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re so lucky, and we\u2019ve done so many cool things and are still getting to do them right now.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the meantime, she\u2019s busy strengthening her brand, exploring new career opportunities and raising her kids.\n\n\u201cOne of these days I\u2019ll peace out and retire to my family and my chickens,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be good.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY's 2018 Modern Woman Magazine Kelly Clarkson (Photo: Studio Gannett)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/11/17/kelly-clarkson-modern-woman/1986196002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Tracy Scott Forson, USA TODAY's Modern Woman Magazine", "title": "Hallmark's movie marathons become a holiday tradition", "description": "Hallmark Channel's holiday movie marathons become a Christmas tradition", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/11/17/hallmark-holiday-movies/2011038002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/15/USAT/7092ef6e-2cd7-4784-917b-86a8b4484c12-ChristmasFirstLookPreview_0067_RT.JPG?crop=3599,2016,x0,y47&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T12:59:05Z", "content": "Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas marathon (Photo: The Hallmark Channel) Theres something predictable and comforting about the holiday season.

The familiarity of favorite carols, Nana\u2019s homemade desserts, the neighbor\u2019s holiday lights and the huge Christmas tree that nightly illuminates the town square are customs many look forward to year after year.\n\nNo matter the combination of yuletide elements that conjures up the holiday spirit for you, chances are, the Hallmark Channel has an original made-for-TV film that captures that same feeling.\n\nThis year, Hallmark Channel\u2019s annual Countdown to Christmas holiday movie event began Oct. 27 and ends on New Year\u2019s Day. In total, the network will air 22 original films during that monthslong period, and its sister channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, will air a dozen during its Miracles of Christmas programming, which started Oct. 26 and also ends Jan. 1.\n\nLike Grandma\u2019s family recipe, the marathon of movies has become a holiday tradition for many. For the past nine years, the event has perpetually grown, offering films that vary in plot, but all have something in common.\n\n\u201cWe look for each of our stories to celebrate the season and deliver on the essence and spirit of Christmas,\u201d says Michelle Vicary, executive vice president of Crown Media Family Networks. \u201cOur promise is to make viewers feel better.\u201d\n\nTime and Talent\n\nThe nightly holiday-themed premieres roll out over two months, but for network executives, it\u2019s a yearlong process, according to Vicary. \u201cOur talent is already asking about what movies they\u2019re going to get in 2019,\u201d she said in June. \u201cWe already have some opportunities that have gone into development. We have talent, writers and producers; 2019 is in process for sure.\u201d\n\nThe films draw several stars from popular \u201980s and \u201990s TV series \u2014 familiar faces, such as Melissa Joan Hart, Candace Cameron Bure, Danica McKellar and Lacey Chabert, who portrays Darcy Fitzwilliam in Hallmark\u2019s Pride, Prejudice and Mistletoe, airing Nov. 23.\n\nLacey Chabert stars in the Hallmark Channel holiday movie \"Pride, Prejudice and Mistletoe.\" (Photo: PROVIDED BY HALLMARK CHANNEL)\n\n\u201cIt takes some imagination to film a Christmas movie in the summer months when the fake snow is melting on set,\u201d says Chabert, who has starred in seven Hallmark holiday movies.\n\n\u201cThey love working with us,\u201d says Vicary of the repeat actors. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want to make a No. 1 movie on television?\u201d\n\nSuccess Story\n\nDuring the months the original movies air, Hallmark ranks high in U.S. households, the network reports. \u201cWe are No. 1 all fourth quarter,\u201d says Vicary.\n\n\u201cWe have 82 million people come and watch the channel at least once during the Countdown to Christmas and Miracles of Christmas events,\u201d she adds, citing viewership data from 2017.\n\nHallmark Movies & Mysteries ranked No. 9 among households during that time period.\n\nAccording to the network, 48 million women watched movies on both Hallmark networks during last year\u2019s events.\n\nAlthough the audience of the often sugary-sweet movies, many that fit into the rom-com category, is comprised of mostly women, men tune in, too. In 2017, 34 million men watched.\n\nRob Bricken says he first learned of the movie marathons years ago, thanks to ads airing while he watched Golden Girls reruns. However, it wasn\u2019t until last year, that he and his wife, Loree Stark, decided to recap each movie and launch the A Very Hallmark Christmas podcast.\n\nA Very Hallmark Christmas podcast (Photo: Provided by Rob Bricken)\n\nDuring Countdown to Christmas, they watch every premiere and immediately post their commentary on the films.\n\n\u201cThere was one time period over Thanksgiving where we watched Hallmark movies 11 days in a row because that\u2019s how many new releases there were,\u201d says Stark, whose favorite 2017 film was Christmas in Angel Falls, starring Rachel Boston as a guardian angel. Bricken most enjoyed Christmas Getaway with Bridget Regan as a travel writer who ends up spending the holiday with a handsome man.\n\nAlthough Vicary, who has been with the network for nearly 20 years, may not have foreseen viewers podcasting about the movies, she says she always had high expectations for the franchise. \u201cWe endeavored to be this big. We come at this with a spirit of hopefulness that we will do as well as we set out to. We learn from any mistakes we make, but largely we understand what our audience wants, and we love to give them what they expect.\u201d\n\nWinning Formula\n\nWhen it comes to meeting viewers\u2019 expectations, Hallmark films follow a formula that is rather clich\u00e9 for TV. Within moments of the opening scene, which usually involves snow falling in a quaint little town, a woman begrudgingly returning home for the holidays or a heroine lamenting her failed love life \u2014 most viewers can practically write the scripts.\n\nFor the actor, that means finding enough distinctions between the similar characters and storylines to bring something unique to each film.\n\n\u201cI look for a different nuance in the characters I play and bring a different flavor,\u201d says Chabert, who understands that the predictability is part of the films\u2019 appeal.\n\nCouple enjoys TV program during the holidays (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe thing I love most about the movies and the thing I find most fans always point out, is not only is there always a happy ending, but they\u2019re focused around tradition, bringing families together and capturing the holiday spirit in the main character. I love those messages,\u201d says Chabert. \u201cIt\u2019s the comfort of knowing what lies\n\nahead, and it\u2019s going to be heartwarming.\u201d\n\nChabert\u2019s efforts to break the monotony have paid off, according to Bricken. \u201cI\u2019ve been fascinated by how much variance the movies have despite being forced to follow a pretty simple formula,\u201d he says. \u201cThese movies can be genuinely funny or truly awful or completely insane, all while hitting the same story beats.\u201d\n\nVicary points out that many American film classics are predictable (not only did we know Jack and Rose would fall in love, we knew the Titanic would sink!) and she has no problem being in the company of those favorites.\n\n\u201cThe first time you see them on screen, you know they get together,\u201d she says of the couples who fall in love by the end of most of the films. For viewers, it\u2019s the journey they enjoy, Vicary explains. \u201cOur team endeavors to make that interesting and fun, and the ratings surely bear out the fact that they continue to tune in with the knowledge that they\u2019re going to feel good and great people are going to end up together.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bricken notes that it\u2019s not just the storylines that are predictable, as the characters have more than just Christmas cheer in common: A large majority of the films feature white actors \u2014 a lack of diversity for which the network has been criticized.\n\n\u201cNot only is there always a happy ending, but they\u2019re focused around tradition, bringing families together and capturing the holiday spirit in the main character. I love those messages.\u201d Lacey Chabert, actress\n\n\u201cYou know what you\u2019re getting and that the heterosexual white couple will get together in the end,\u201d Bricken says.\n\nLast year, Hallmark\u2019s Enchanted Christmas starred husband-and-wife duo Carlos and Alexa PenaVega, who are of Latino descent. Black actresses Holly Robinson Peete and Sheryl Lee Ralph have co-starred in recent Hallmark holiday movies, and the network is hoping to do more to represent the country\u2019s diversity.\n\nThis year, Peete, Tia Mowry-Hardrict, Jerrika Hinton, Christina Milian and Tatyana Ali star in Hallmark holiday movies. The PenaVegas each headline films airing in December.\n\n\u201cWe want more diversity in our lead roles and are actively going after some of the leading actors and actresses in the world,\u201d says Vicary. \u201cWe still need to do more,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe overindex in diversity in executive producers, writers, directors and even the top leadership of Crown Media. ... We are deeply committed to making our programming more diverse.\u201d\n\nAlthough other networks premiere original holiday movies, Vicary says the Hallmark brand demands a certain standard.\n\n\u201cOur formula is to treat each movie \u2014 even though there are a lot of them \u2014 as though it\u2019s the No. 1 we\u2019re making for the season.

(Photo: UIG via Getty Images)\n\nGENEVA \u2013 With its charming centuries-old buildings and a picturesque harbor, the small Swiss town of Arbon looks tranquil and laid back.\n\nBut as the local newspaper Thurgauer Zeitung reported recently, a local business is disturbing the peace of a handful of residents in this scenic lakeside community of 14,444 people.\n\nThe object of the dispute is the local brothel, located in the town\u2019s historic center, just a stone\u2019s throw away from the City Hall. Several residents who live in the brothel\u2019s vicinity recently wrote a letter to the city officials, complaining about the sights and sounds emanating from the facility, and asking authorities to shut it down.\n\n\u201cAlmost every day, the women stand naked by the windows,\u201d the neighbors wrote, adding that \u201cthe ladies wait for their customers and start loud music as soon as they arrive.\"\n\nBut municipal officials responded that the brothel will be allowed to operate because of the valuable service it provides. \u201cThis establishment has a right to exist, as it fulfills the social need of the population,\u201d authorities wrote in a letter to the complainants.\n\nThey added that the disturbances have a \"neighborly character\u201d and are accidental rather than intentional.\n\nThis response has sparked swift reactions in the local media. While some pointed out that a brothel shouldn\u2019t be located in a residential area, others applauded the municipal decision. \u201cThese people watch their neighbors through the window and then complain about what they see?\u201d reader Sem Meier commented in the Blick newspaper. \u201cThey want to forbid whatever action doesn\u2019t meet their moral standards,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother reader, Peter Duck, proposed a compromise for a peaceful coexistence in the neighborhood, suggesting the brothel should \u201cinvite the neighbors over. Then nobody will complain.\u201d\n\nMore: Sex in the city: Zurich\u2019s prostitution 'sex boxes' deemed success in Switzerland\n\nThe municipality\u2019s refusal to shut down the brothel reflects the liberal and pragmatic attitude the Swiss have toward sex workers. Prostitution is legal in this country of 8.5 million people, and regarded as a regular service industry that falls under the category of \u201ceconomic freedom.\u201d\n\nStrict regulations\n\nThe sex industry here is heavily regulated to prevent pimping, human trafficking and ties with criminal networks. Prostitutes must register with their city authorities, get regular health checks, pay income tax, make Social Security contributions, and generally comply with the, um, penal code.\n\nIn Arbon\u2019s brothel, sex workers \u201care independent contractors who set their own prices,\u201d its website says.\n\n\u201cThere \u2018s no rule that sex clubs must be located on the outskirts or in industrial zones,\u201d Thomas Steccanella, spokesman for Arbon\u2019s municipal authorities told USA TODAY.\n\nA brothel has been in this downtown location \u201cfor over 30 years. Complaints have been very rare,\u201d Steccanella added.\n\nMostly foreign women ply their trade in hundreds of brothels across Switzerland. They come here from countries where prostitution is illegal \u2014 mostly from South America, Eastern Europe, and EU nations.\n\nIn Geneva, sex workers have formed a union which liaises with city authorities to improve prostitutes\u2019 work conditions and earning potential. In Zurich, taxpayer \u2014sponsored drive-in \u201csex boxes\u201d have provided a safe and discreet environment for sex workers.\n\nAnd a few years ago, dozens of brothels in the city of Lugano made news when they started training prostitutes to use defibrillators after several clients suffered heart attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, a resolution to Arbon\u2019s tiff has just been found. The brothel\u2019s manager said he is instructing his staff to be more discreet and promises to mask the building\u2019s windows, so no offensive sights permeate the neighborhood.\n\nNow local residents will be able to enjoy their town\u2019s pretty scenery as far as a naked eye can see.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/17/swiss-authorities-refuse-close-brothel-fulfills-social-need-population-sex-worker/1808337002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Maurie Backman, The Motley Fool", "title": "Your dream retirement age may not be realistic.

Buzz60's Natasha Abellard has the story. Buzz60\n\nToday's workers want to retire young, but whether they'll be able to is another story.\n\nMiddle-aged man relaxing by a lake. (Photo: GETTY IMAGES)\n\nMany workers look forward to retirement and all it symbolizes \u2013 a permanent break from the daily grind and the ability to pursue hobbies without restraint.\n\nBut while plenty of working folks have pretty much resigned themselves to retiring in their late 60s or 70s, most Americans would rather call it quits much earlier.\n\nThe ideal retirement age for U.S. workers today is 58 1/2, according to a new study by GOBankingRates. Whether that's realistic, however, is another story.\n\nThe challenges of early retirement\n\nThough retiring at any age means moving from a steady paycheck to a fixed income, there are certain challenges that come with retiring at the relatively young age of 58 1/2. For one thing, savings housed in a traditional IRA or 401(k) cannot be withdrawn without penalty prior to age 59 1/2. To retire a year earlier than that, therefore, hinges on having enough savings in a traditional bank or brokerage account to cover the bills until retirement funds can be tapped.\n\nMore: Despite common usage, health savings accounts are helpful for retirement\n\nThen again, a large number of workers today won't get much from their IRAs or 401(k)s in retirement if they don't ramp up their savings efforts. An estimated 42 percent of working-age adults have less than $10,000 in long-term savings, which is hardly enough to have an impact during retirement, regardless of what age it starts at.\n\nThen there's Social Security to think about. Eligible seniors are allowed to start claiming benefits as early as age 62, which means that folks who retire at 58 1/2 can't access those benefits for a solid 3.5 years. Furthermore, filing at 62 means doing so ahead of full retirement age, and that's a dangerous move that could result in a permanent reduction in benefits \u2013 something that's apt to hurt seniors who don't have much in the way of savings.\n\nFinally, there's healthcare to think about. Medicare eligibility doesn't kick in until age 65, so retiring 6.5 years earlier means having to absorb the cost of health insurance independently.\n\nPlan ahead to retire early\n\nIf your goal is really to retire early, then there are steps you can take to make that happen, the most important of which is to save consistently beginning at an early age. If you were to start setting aside $600 a month at age 23 1/2 and continue through 58 1/2, you'd wind up with close to $1 million if your investments were to generate an average annual 7 percent return during that period. And since that 7 percent is a few percentage points below the stock market's average, it's certainly doable over a 35-year time frame.\n\nMore: Most women now see retirement as the 'most liberating phase' of their lives\n\nThat said, you'd also need to store some savings in a nontraditional retirement plan to gain penalty-free access to that money at age 58 1/2. But if you save in a Roth IRA, for example, or put some of your money into a traditional brokerage account, you can grow wealth and have easier access to your money later in life.\n\nDon't rush into retirement\n\nAlthough retiring early has its benefits, it can be challenging not just from a financial perspective, but a mental one as well. Going from full-time work to an unstructured schedule can result in a fair share of emotional upheaval, so much so that the risk of depression increases exponentially once retirement kicks in.\n\nIf you're eager to retire at 58 1/2, or thereabouts, because you're worried that you won't have enough time to fulfill your goals if you wait, consider that Americans are living longer these days, with 1 in 4 65-year-olds living past age 90 and 1 in 10 living past 95. Therefore, you might find that retiring in your 60s gives you the best of both worlds \u2013 access to the money, benefits and resources you need to stay afloat financially and enough time to do the things you've always wanted.\n\nMore: How to max out your retirement savings in 2019\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

But that is a distinct possibility unless a global effort succeeds in preserving those great creatures.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2013, forest elephants in Central Africa suffered losses of 65 percent. The surge in elephant-poaching in the mid-2000s, combined with habitat loss, has led to a steady decline in savanna elephant populations in much of Africa, as well. Tanzania, for example, has seen losses of 60 percent in recent years.\n\nFortunately, more and more leaders are focusing on the crisis. This October at the 2018 Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in London, conservation experts joined law enforcement and government officials from across the globe to send a message that the world is serious about wildlife crime.\n\nThe conference came two years after the Obama administration imposed a strong ban on ivory sales in the United States. That effort played no small role in encouraging China \u2014 the world\u2019s largest ivory market \u2014 to do the same. Then this April, the United Kingdom set itself on a course to adopt the strongest restrictions on ivory sales of any country; the legislation is on the verge of being finalized.\n\nMore work is needed to protect elephants\n\nBut more work is needed to save elephants from extinction. Two big markets for ivory \u2014 the European Union and Japan \u2014 should also ban the domestic ivory trade, which encourages illegal activity. Driven by criminal syndicates in Africa and Asia, elephants are poached for the high value of their tusks when carved into sculptures and trinkets.\n\nWanting to protect African elephants when I was secretary of State, I worked with President George H.W. Bush to press for a total ban on international commercial ivory trade through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in 1989. It succeeded for a time in helping elephant populations recover. Sadly, the ivory trade surged a decade later due to growing demand and the growth of sophisticated criminal trafficking networks.\n\nMore: States can lead the way on climate change policy as Trump rolls back protections\n\nElephants trumpet ivory ban: James Baker\n\nDon't drill in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Facts show it makes no sense.\n\nWhile wildlife crime has not received the same attention as trafficking in weapons, drugs and people, the criminals are just as ruthless. Judicial systems, meanwhile, have historically failed to emphasize law enforcement in wildlife crime, while corruption has helped criminal actors escape punishment.\n\nFor the people living in countries within the elephant range, elephants are more than the most iconic species on any continent. They are a major source of tourism revenue.\n\nIf we are to protect the world\u2019s remaining elephants, we must commit ourselves to supporting the countries where they live, and whose communities are threatened by criminal trafficking networks.\n\nJames A.

Charles Darwin made Galapagos famous during the 1800s when he published his theories on natural selection and evolution.\n\nIn this gallery we've rounded up photos of wildlife found on the islands, including the ridiculously colorful (flamingos), the ridiculously sized (whale sharks), the ridiculously old (tortoises) the ridiculously cute (penguins), and some that are just ridiculous in general (blue-footed boobies).\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/11/17/galapagos-islands-wildlife-animals/2034258002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Mayweather's exhibition vs. Japanese kickboxer back on", "description": "Floyd Mayweather's match with a Japanese kickboxer is on for New Year's Eve as an exhibition fight, with knockouts allowed but likely no decision granted on a win or a loss", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2018/11/17/mayweathers-exhibition-vs-japanese-kickboxer-back-on/38550269/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/99e1f4da41abeb6fa22ad60e32111aaa27023371/c=0-114-3000-1802/local/-/media/2018/11/17/USATODAY/usatsports/d7e57437055b4835aed2ec9e0539edfc.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T09:24:41Z", "content": "RIZIN Fighting Federation chairman Nobuyuki Sakakibara speaks on the exhibition match between Floyd Mayweather and Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa upon arrival at Haneda airport in Tokyo Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018.

Other details are still being worked out.\n\n\"We don't want people to think this is some half-hearted playing around,\" Sakakibara said, appearing before reporters in a sweatshirt.\n\nHe also said spectators would not see mere \"casual sparring.\"\n\nSakakibara stressed the event would include the largest payout for an exhibition fight but did not give specifics. Mayweather previously said he was already making \"seven figures\" just by talking about it.\n\n\"He will stand before Tenshin Dec. 31,\" Sakakibara said of Mayweather. \"It's up to Tenshin whether he can create a miracle.\"\n\nSakakibara acknowledged he could not rule out a last-minute cancellation but promised he would do his best to make what he called the \"fun show\" happen. He also said he could not tell what kind of shape Mayweather was in because he has not watched him work out.\n\nThe promoter compared the event to the first \"Rocky\" film, as well as to the 1976 match between Muhammad Ali and Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki.\n\nMayweather told TMZ Sports earlier this week he would take part in the exhibition match after all, stressing he was making \"a ton of money\" even in retirement.\n\nThe best seats for the fight will cost 100,000 yen ($900) each. The cheapest seats cost 7,000 yen ($60).\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nYuri Kageyama on Twitter: https://twitter.com/yurikageyama and on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Toru Hanai, AP)\n\nSEOUL \u2013 Vice President Mike Pence laid out a forceful challenge to China\u2019s growing global influence on Saturday, saying that the United States offered countries \u201ca better option\u201d for economic partnership and criticizing Chinese \u201cauthoritarianism and aggression.\u201d\n\nPence was speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, a gathering of political and business leaders from 21 Pacific Rim countries and territories that make up 60 percent of the world economy.\n\nIn his address, Pence said the United States had a vision for a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States has extended a hand in the spirit of friendship and partnership, seeking collaboration and not control,\u201d he said.\n\nPence touted U.S. investment as an alternative to Beijing\u2019s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure and development project spanning Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has come under criticism for leaving some countries deeply indebted to Beijing and saddled with projects that have become white elephants. The government of Sri Lanka, for example, recently handed over its $1-billion Chinese-developed Hambantota Port to China on a 99-year lease after it couldn\u2019t meet its debt commitments.\n\nOther countries, such as Malaysia, have canceled or are reviewing billions of dollars in BRI projects.\n\n\u201cKnow that the United States offers a better option,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe don't drown our partners in a sea of debt, we don't coerce or compromise your independence. The United States deals openly and fairly. We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road.\u201d\n\nPence defended the $250 billion tariffs that President Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese goods, which has sparked a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies this year, and said that the U.S. could double that figure.\n\nThe vice president accused China of putting up \u201ctremendous barriers\u201d to companies entering its market and accused Beijing of unfair practices such as \u201cforced technology transfer, intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies on an unprecedented scale.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States will not change course until China changes its ways,\u201d Pence said.\n\nBut while Pence reiterated this administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision, China and other nations defended the system of global free trade at the APEC Summit.\n\nDelivering a keynote address directly before Pence, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned against protectionism and unilateralism and said that countries were now facing a choice between cooperation and confrontation.\n\n\"Mankind has once again reached a crossroads,\" he said. \"Which direction should we choose? Cooperation or confrontation? Openness or closing doors? Win-win progress or a zero-sum game?\"\n\nXi also defended China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, saying that it was \u201cnot designed to serve any hidden geopolitical agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not an exclusive club that is closed to non-members nor is it a trap as some people have labeled it,\" he said.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison also pushed back against the rising of trade protectionism.\n\n\"I know there are legitimate questions around trade arrangements,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the solution to perceived unfair trade practices is more likely to be found around the negotiating table than it is in rebuilding a tariff wall.\"\n\n\"Our efforts must be about persuading and convincing our peoples again about the domestic benefits (of free trade),\u201d Morrison added.\n\nPence used his speech to criticize China\u2019s rising assertiveness in the region, particularly in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, where Beijing has been building military bases on artificial islands.\n\n\u201cAuthoritarianism and aggression have no place in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America will continue to uphold the freedom of the seas and the skies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows and our national interest demands. Harassment will only strengthen our resolve.

Several residents who live in the brothel\u2019s vicinity recently wrote a letter to the city officials, complaining about the sights and sounds emanating from the facility, and asking authorities to shut it down.\n\n\u201cAlmost every day, the women stand naked by the windows,\u201d the neighbors wrote, adding that \u201cthe ladies wait for their customers and start loud music as soon as they arrive.\"\n\nBut municipal officials responded that the brothel will be allowed to operate because of the valuable service it provides. \u201cThis establishment has a right to exist, as it fulfills the social need of the population,\u201d authorities wrote in a letter to the complainants.\n\nThey added that the disturbances have a \"neighborly character\u201d and are accidental rather than intentional.\n\nThis response has sparked swift reactions in the local media. While some pointed out that a brothel shouldn\u2019t be located in a residential area, others applauded the municipal decision. \u201cThese people watch their neighbors through the window and then complain about what they see?\u201d reader Sem Meier commented in the Blick newspaper. \u201cThey want to forbid whatever action doesn\u2019t meet their moral standards,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother reader, Peter Duck, proposed a compromise for a peaceful coexistence in the neighborhood, suggesting the brothel should \u201cinvite the neighbors over. Then nobody will complain.\u201d\n\nMore: Sex in the city: Zurich\u2019s prostitution 'sex boxes' deemed success in Switzerland\n\nThe municipality\u2019s refusal to shut down the brothel reflects the liberal and pragmatic attitude the Swiss have toward sex workers. Prostitution is legal in this country of 8.5 million people, and regarded as a regular service industry that falls under the category of \u201ceconomic freedom.\u201d\n\nStrict regulations\n\nThe sex industry here is heavily regulated to prevent pimping, human trafficking and ties with criminal networks. Prostitutes must register with their city authorities, get regular health checks, pay income tax, make Social Security contributions, and generally comply with the, um, penal code.\n\nIn Arbon\u2019s brothel, sex workers \u201care independent contractors who set their own prices,\u201d its website says.\n\n\u201cThere \u2018s no rule that sex clubs must be located on the outskirts or in industrial zones,\u201d Thomas Steccanella, spokesman for Arbon\u2019s municipal authorities told USA TODAY.\n\nA brothel has been in this downtown location \u201cfor over 30 years. Complaints have been very rare,\u201d Steccanella added.\n\nMostly foreign women ply their trade in hundreds of brothels across Switzerland. They come here from countries where prostitution is illegal \u2014 mostly from South America, Eastern Europe, and EU nations.\n\nIn Geneva, sex workers have formed a union which liaises with city authorities to improve prostitutes\u2019 work conditions and earning potential. In Zurich, taxpayer \u2014sponsored drive-in \u201csex boxes\u201d have provided a safe and discreet environment for sex workers.\n\nAnd a few years ago, dozens of brothels in the city of Lugano made news when they started training prostitutes to use defibrillators after several clients suffered heart attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, a resolution to Arbon\u2019s tiff has just been found. The brothel\u2019s manager said he is instructing his staff to be more discreet and promises to mask the building\u2019s windows, so no offensive sights permeate the neighborhood.\n\nNow local residents will be able to enjoy their town\u2019s pretty scenery as far as a naked eye can see.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/17/swiss-authorities-refuse-close-brothel-fulfills-social-need-population-sex-worker/1808337002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Paradise Jam resumes with 2 games in consolation bracket", "description": "The Paradise Jam resumes play Saturday with a pair of games in the consolation bracket", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/17/paradise-jam-resumes-with-2-games-in-consolation-bracket/38550267/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T08:09:17Z", "content": "ST.

It also called for an independent president and vice president; presumably, that would mean they aren't connected to either the sports movement (the International Olympic Committee) or governments, each of which provide half of WADA's funding.\n\nCritics have argued the changes don't go far enough, and want a stronger voice for athletes and less control over decision-making by people with ties to the IOC and other sports entities. Vice president Linda Helleland, an outspoken critic of WADA's decision to reinstate Russia, is expected to run for president when Reedie's term expires next year. Helleland is the Minister of Children and Equality in Norway; it's unclear how the governance reforms would impact her eligibility.\n\nRobertson, who stepped down as WADA's lead investigator in January 2016, took umbrage to the agency's portrayal of his op-ed as containing \"baseless allegations.\"\n\n\"They were factual, based on my time leading the investigation into Russian doping, and I stand by what I wrote,\" he said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 NASCAR's driver carousel will spin long after the season finale.\n\nFormer Cup champions Kurt Busch and Matt Kenseth, and Daniel Suarez, AJ Allmendinger, Regan Smith and Jamie McMurray are among the drivers certain to start next season with new teams or new roles.\n\nBusch, the 2004 champion, is seemingly on his way out at Stewart-Haas Racing and his No. 41 Ford could be the landing spot for Suarez. Suarez, the 2016 Xfinity Series champion, was rushed to Cup to fill Carl Edwards' seat when he suddenly walked away from Joe Gibbs Racing. After two seasons and no wins, JGR cut ties with the 26-year-old Suarez. Suarez became expendable when Furniture Row Racing folded and 2017 champion Martin Truex Jr. suddenly became available.\n\n\"It's time to go somewhere else and try to win more races and championships,\" Suarez said.\n\nSuarez, NASCAR's first Mexican champion in the Xfinity Series, declined to discuss his 2019 plans.\n\n\"I don't know if it's going to be NASCAR,\" he said, chuckling.\n\nBusch also played coy with his plans, though many believe he's a lock to take his Monster Energy sponsorship to Chip Ganassi Racing. Busch, knocked out of championship contention last week at Phoenix, would not say that Sunday's race at Homestead-Miami Speedway would be his last at SHR.\n\n\"I don't know. We'll see how things play out,\" Busch said. \"There are still things that have to be sorted through on the team side, manufacturer side, sponsorship side.\"\n\nBusch won six times since he joined SHR in 2014 \u2014 including the 2017 Daytona 500 \u2014 and signed a one-year extension with the team last December. He was wrecked late by Denny Hamlin last week at Phoenix to deny him a shot at racing Sunday for the title.\n\nHis consolation prize? Busch was invited by Monster to golf with Tiger Woods at a corporate function in the Bahamas.\n\n\"He goes, so what's your handicap? I go, my golf swing,\" Busch said.\n\nBusch and Suarez will at least have rides in 2019. McMurray has lost his ride in the No. 1 Chevrolet and has been offered a leadership position with the team. McMurray has seven career victories in the Cup Series, including the 2010 Daytona 500. He has been with Ganassi since 2010. Ganassi also offered the 42-year-old McMurray a contract for the 2019 Daytona 500.\n\nMcMurray is interested in both opportunities, but he hasn't ruled out racing for another team next season.\n\n\"I would have loved to tell everybody what I think I'm going to do next year, but I just don't have it finalized yet, so I'm just going to kind of wait,\" he said. \"Maybe use Instagram or Twitter as my source of revealing what I'm going to do.\"\n\nMcMurray has leaned on Kenseth, his closest friend in the garage, for advice on what retirement and open weekends would feel like. Kenseth was nudged out of NASCAR last season by Joe Gibbs Racing to make room for Erik Jones. He returned on a part-time basis this season with owner Jack Roush at Roush Fenway Racing in the No. 6 Ford. He's had just one top-10 finish in 14 stars \u2014 2011 Daytona 500 champion Trevor Bayne made the other 21 starts \u2014 and Kenseth is set to head into retirement without much fanfare. Kenseth has 39 wins and was a two-time Daytona 500 champion (2009, 2012).\n\nThere's plenty of movement among the drivers who are usually in the rear of the fields.\n\nRyan Newman was released from Richard Childress Racing and will replace Kenseth/Bayne at Roush. Daniel Hemric, who is racing for the Xfinity Series championship, will replace Newman in the No. 31 Chevrolet.\n\nKasey Kahne took an early retirement because of illness and Smith filled in for the final 11 races for Leavine Family Racing. Matt DiBenedetto will drive the No. 95 Toyota for Leavine in 2019.\n\nAllmendinger is looking for work after JTG Daugherty Racing decided to release him after this season. Ryan Preece, who made five Cup starts in 2015, will replace him.\n\nAllmendinger posted a series of tweets Saturday night thanking everyone who supported him during his racing career.\n\n\"We wish we could go out on our own terms,\" he tweeted. \"Not always do we get what we want.

(Photo: Toru Hanai, AP)\n\nSEOUL \u2013 Vice President Mike Pence laid out a forceful challenge to China\u2019s growing global influence on Saturday, saying that the United States offered countries \u201ca better option\u201d for economic partnership and criticizing Chinese \u201cauthoritarianism and aggression.\u201d\n\nPence was speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, a gathering of political and business leaders from 21 Pacific Rim countries and territories that make up 60 percent of the world economy.\n\nIn his address, Pence said the United States had a vision for a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States has extended a hand in the spirit of friendship and partnership, seeking collaboration and not control,\u201d he said.\n\nPence touted U.S. investment as an alternative to Beijing\u2019s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure and development project spanning Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has come under criticism for leaving some countries deeply indebted to Beijing and saddled with projects that have become white elephants. The government of Sri Lanka, for example, recently handed over its $1-billion Chinese-developed Hambantota Port to China on a 99-year lease after it couldn\u2019t meet its debt commitments.\n\nOther countries, such as Malaysia, have canceled or are reviewing billions of dollars in BRI projects.\n\n\u201cKnow that the United States offers a better option,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe don't drown our partners in a sea of debt, we don't coerce or compromise your independence. The United States deals openly and fairly. We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road.\u201d\n\nPence defended the $250 billion tariffs that President Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese goods, which has sparked a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies this year, and said that the U.S. could double that figure.\n\nThe vice president accused China of putting up \u201ctremendous barriers\u201d to companies entering its market and accused Beijing of unfair practices such as \u201cforced technology transfer, intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies on an unprecedented scale.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States will not change course until China changes its ways,\u201d Pence said.\n\nBut while Pence reiterated this administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision, China and other nations defended the system of global free trade at the APEC Summit.\n\nDelivering a keynote address directly before Pence, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned against protectionism and unilateralism and said that countries were now facing a choice between cooperation and confrontation.\n\n\"Mankind has once again reached a crossroads,\" he said. \"Which direction should we choose? Cooperation or confrontation? Openness or closing doors? Win-win progress or a zero-sum game?\"\n\nXi also defended China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, saying that it was \u201cnot designed to serve any hidden geopolitical agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not an exclusive club that is closed to non-members nor is it a trap as some people have labeled it,\" he said.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison also pushed back against the rising of trade protectionism.\n\n\"I know there are legitimate questions around trade arrangements,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the solution to perceived unfair trade practices is more likely to be found around the negotiating table than it is in rebuilding a tariff wall.\"\n\n\"Our efforts must be about persuading and convincing our peoples again about the domestic benefits (of free trade),\u201d Morrison added.\n\nPence used his speech to criticize China\u2019s rising assertiveness in the region, particularly in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, where Beijing has been building military bases on artificial islands.\n\n\u201cAuthoritarianism and aggression have no place in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America will continue to uphold the freedom of the seas and the skies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows and our national interest demands. Harassment will only strengthen our resolve. We will not change course.\u201d\n\ntariff (Photo: usa today)\n\nBeijing and Washington have had a number of close encounters in the South China Sea, as the U.S. Navy conducts \u201cfreedom of navigation operations\u201d in waters that China claims sovereignty over.\n\nPence also announced a military pact with Australia and Papua New Guinea to expand operations at a Manus Island naval base in PNG, in a move that is seen as a counter to China\u2019s aggressive push for influence in the South Pacific.\n\n\"We will work with these nations to protect the sovereignty and maritime routes of Pacific Island nations,\" he said.\n\nTrump, who is not attending the APEC summit, is scheduled to meet with President Xi at the G20 Summit in Argentina at the end of the month.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/17/pence-challenges-china-economic-summit/2036986002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY", "title": "Argentina finds lost submarine a year later", "description": "Argentina finds lost submarine a year later", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/17/argentina-finds-missing-submarine/2036290002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/46c38334-de69-453d-94cc-15ca900f5355/46c38334-de69-453d-94cc-15ca900f5355_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T07:05:18Z", "content": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Argentina's navy announced early Saturday that searchers found the missing submarine ARA San Juan deep in the Atlantic a year after it disappeared with 44 crewmen aboard.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Argentina's navy announced early Saturday that searchers found the missing submarine ARA San Juan deep in the Atlantic a year after it disappeared with 44 crewmen aboard.\n\nThe vessel was detected 2,625 feet deep in waters off the Valdes Peninsula in Argentine Patagonia, the statement said.\n\nThe navy said a \"positive identification\" had been made by a remote-operated submersible from the American ship Ocean Infinity, which was hired for the latest search for the missing vessel.\n\nThe discovery was announced just two days after families of the missing sailors held a commemoration one year after the sub disappeared on Nov. 15, 2017.\n\nOn Thursday, on the anniversary of the disappearance, President Mauricio Macri said the families of the submariners should not feel alone and delivered an \"absolute and non-negotiable commitment\" to find \"the truth.\"\n\nMacri promised a full investigation after the submarine was lost. Federal police raided naval bases and other buildings last January as part of the probe, soon after the government dismissed the head of the navy.\n\nThe San Juan was returning to its base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata when contact was lost.\n\nArgentina gave up hope of finding survivors after an intense search aided by 18 countries, but the navy has continued searching for the vessel.\n\nThe German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in the mid-1980s and was most recently refitted between 2008 and 2014. During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts said refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers, and even the tiniest mistake during the cutting phase can put the safety of the ship and crew at risk.\n\nThe navy said previously the captain reported on Nov. 15 that water entered the snorkel and caused one of the sub's batteries to short-circuit. The captain later communicated that it had been contained.\n\nSome hours later, an explosion was detected near the time and place where the San Juan was last heard from. The navy said the blast could have been caused by a \"concentration of hydrogen\" triggered by the battery problem reported by the captain.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/17/argentina-finds-missing-submarine/2036290002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "E.

UCLA was a dramatically different team over the final 20 minutes.\n\n\"The second 20 was the best we've played to date,\" Alford said.\n\nThe Bruins opened on a 26-9 run, punctuating the spurt with five consecutive dunks \u2014 two each by Brown and Hands and one by Wilkes \u2014 that extended their lead to 62-37.\n\n\"When you have a player like that you got to use him as much as possible,\" reserve Jules Bernard said of Brown.\n\nBrown got things started by dunking on an alley-oop pass from Wilkes. His second jam was off a pass by Hands from the top of the key. Hands stole the ball and got out on a fast break before throwing the ball down with one hand as part of the sequence, drawing raucous cheers.\n\nJust in case fans hadn't seen enough highlight moves, Prince Ali came up with a flying one-hand dunk that made it 79-46.

They led 29-28 late in the first half.\n\n\"The first half we really executed the game plan and then we let them have too many offensive rebounds,\" Saint Francis coach Rob Krimmel said. \"The second half they really willed their way.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSaint Francis: The Red Flash opened a brutal stretch in which they play three straight ranked opponents on the road. Next up is No. 7 North Carolina on Monday, followed by No. 16 Virginia Tech on Nov. 24. They own a 49-game skid against ranked opponents that dates to Jan. 25, 1959, when Saint Francis beat St. Bonaventure 92-81.

He won the vacant belt against Terry Flanagan in a split-decision June 9 in Flanagan's hometown of Manchester, England, so he had experience dealing with a hostile environment.\n\nHe said he tuned out the noise in Oklahoma City.\n\n\"I had faith in myself,'\" Hooker said. \"I believe in myself. And I said once I get in the ring, it's just me and him one-on-one, and not the crowd.\"\n\nHooker used his reach to keep Saucedo at bay in the first round, though the crowd was loud and chanted \"O-K-C!\" several times.\n\nSaucedo (28-1) put Hooker on the canvas with a right early in the second round, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Hooker said he made a mistake.\n\n\"The second round, he caught me with a shot,\" he said. \"Not bad. I put my hands down. He caught me. A little bit out of balance.\"\n\nHooker's nose was bloodied, but Saucedo couldn't finish him.\n\nSaucedo had Hooker on the ropes for most of the fifth round, but Hooker showed he had some energy left with a flurry in the closing seconds of the round.\n\n\"Let me tell you, he didn't really hit me,\" Hooker said. \"I know he was young, he was hungry. Once I got on the ropes, he done went crazy and dumb, and that's exactly what he did.\"\n\nHooker took charge in the seventh. He forced a standing eight count, and then finished Saucedo later in the round.\n\n\"I knew the first of the round, my right hand was landing,\" Hooker said. \"I could tell in his eye it was hurting, but he's a warrior. Late in the round, he couldn't take that power.\"\n\nIn the other big match of the night, Egidijus Kavaliauskas (21-0, 17 KOs) knocked out Nicaragua's Roberto Arriaza (17-1) in the third round with WBO world welterweight champion Terence Crawford watching at ringside.\n\nArriaza looked strong in the first round. Kavaliauskas rallied in the second, despite suffering a cut under his right eye from a head butt. The \"Mean Machine\" knocked Arriaza out with a crushing right to the head in the final seconds of the third round.\n\nBob Arum, CEO of Top Rank Boxing, promotes both Crawford and Kavaliauskas. He said they \"are going to look very closely at having Egidijus challenge Crawford for the welterweight title\" in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n\"I want to fight the best in the welterweight division, and the best guy right now is Terence Crawford,\" Kavaliauskas said. \"I am ready for that fight next.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But to keep revenues flowing, Huntington needs more orders. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Argentina's navy announced early Saturday that searchers found the missing submarine ARA San Juan deep in the Atlantic a year after it disappeared with 44 crewmen aboard.\n\nThe vessel was detected 2,625 feet deep in waters off the Valdes Peninsula in Argentine Patagonia, the statement said.\n\nThe navy said a \"positive identification\" had been made by a remote-operated submersible from the American ship Ocean Infinity, which was hired for the latest search for the missing vessel.\n\nThe discovery was announced just two days after families of the missing sailors held a commemoration one year after the sub disappeared on Nov. 15, 2017.\n\nOn Thursday, on the anniversary of the disappearance, President Mauricio Macri said the families of the submariners should not feel alone and delivered an \"absolute and non-negotiable commitment\" to find \"the truth.\"\n\nMacri promised a full investigation after the submarine was lost. Federal police raided naval bases and other buildings last January as part of the probe, soon after the government dismissed the head of the navy.\n\nThe San Juan was returning to its base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata when contact was lost.\n\nArgentina gave up hope of finding survivors after an intense search aided by 18 countries, but the navy has continued searching for the vessel.\n\nThe German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in the mid-1980s and was most recently refitted between 2008 and 2014. During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts said refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers, and even the tiniest mistake during the cutting phase can put the safety of the ship and crew at risk.\n\nThe navy said previously the captain reported on Nov. 15 that water entered the snorkel and caused one of the sub's batteries to short-circuit. The captain later communicated that it had been contained.\n\nSome hours later, an explosion was detected near the time and place where the San Juan was last heard from. The navy said the blast could have been caused by a \"concentration of hydrogen\" triggered by the battery problem reported by the captain.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/17/argentina-finds-missing-submarine/2036290002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Taylor runs Memphis past SMU in 28-18 win", "description": "Patrick Taylor Jr., ran for 111 yards and two touchdowns and Memphis beat SMU 28-18", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/17/taylor-runs-memphis-past-smu-in-28-18-win/38550167/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T06:01:03Z", "content": "DALLAS (AP) Patrick Taylor Jr., ran for 111 yards and two touchdowns and Memphis beat SMU 28-18 on Friday night.

That wasn't the case this season.\n\nMorgan Reilly scored with 1:43 remaining in overtime to lift the Maple Leafs over the Anaheim Ducks 2-1 on Friday night for a three-game sweep through the Golden State.\n\nThe win allowed Toronto to overtake Nashville and Tampa Bay for the NHL's best record at 14-6-0. The Maple Leafs \u2014 who beat Los Angeles on Tuesday and San Jose on Thursday \u2014 have won six of seven and are unbeaten in three overtime games this season.\n\nComing into the trip, Toronto had dropped 10 of 12 in California.\n\n\"I've had lots of good teams come out here and not be able to do it. One team always seems to get you on the back to back,\" Toronto coach Mike Babcock said. \"I think we have some real good veterans, and we have to be steady on the rudder. We have the chance to be a real good team over time and have to keep on building.\"\n\nReilly was wide open to the right of goalie John Gibson when he took a pass from Mitch Marner and unleashed a wrist shot for his ninth of the season. It is Marner's 20th assist and 26th point, which puts him tied for second in the league in scoring. Reilly is tied for sixth with 25 points.\n\nPatrick Marleau scored Toronto's other goal. Garret Sparks, who was playing in only his fourth game of the season, stopped a career-high 38 shots.\n\n\"I felt pretty good. I didn't like the goal I let in, but other than that it is all about competing and trying to get in front of the next puck,\" Sparks said.\n\nPontus Aberg scored for Anaheim and Gibson stopped 33 shots. The Ducks have dropped three of four.\n\nAnaheim had a couple of open-goal chances in the third period but was unable to convert.\n\n\"We've been snakebit to provide offense and tonight was a demonstration of that,\" Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle said. \"It was probably the most frustrating time all year because of the open nets we missed.\"\n\nMarleau opened the scoring less than seven minutes into the game when he positioned himself in front of the net and redirected Jake Gardiner's pass with his left skate. It is the 539th goal of Marleau's career, giving him sole possession of 32nd place on the NHL's career list\n\nAberg tied it with less than two minutes remaining in the second period with a 45-foot slap shot for his team-leading sixth. The goal broke a Ducks' scoring drought of 124:05, dating back to the second period of Monday's game against Nashville.\n\nNOTES: Toronto is 9-0 when scoring first this season. ... The Maple Leafs are 2-1-0 in the second game of back-to-backs. ... Marleau has 32 goals against Anaheim, which ranks first among active players. ... Toronto C John Tavares had a seven-game point streak snapped. He had five goals and five assists during that span. ... Aberg has points in three of his last five games (two goals and an assist). ... Anaheim has successfully killed 28 of its last 31 when it has been a man down. ... The Ducks have gone to overtime in a league-high seven home games and are 3-2-2. ... Anaheim has limited teams to two or fewer goals in 11 games this season, which is tied for second in the league.

(AP Photo/Andres Leighton) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Any talk of a trap game did not get much attention from No. 23 Boise State in practice this week.\n\nThe Broncos went out and played against a struggling New Mexico team as if a huge game was not looming on their schedule next week against No. 14 Utah State.\n\n\"This week, it was all about New Mexico,\" Broncos coach Bryan Harsin said. \"We can control how we play the game and we did.\"\n\nSean Modster caught a career-best three touchdowns passes to lead Boise State to a 45-14 victory over New Mexico on Friday night.\n\n\"It felt good to come out here and do what needed to get done,\" Modster said. \"Our whole mentality was to get in and get out.\"\n\nThe Broncos (9-2, 6-1 Mountain West) took advantage of three turnovers by the Lobos (3-8, 1-6) that they turned into 24 points.\n\nModster finished with a career-high nine catches for 129 yards. Broncos quarterback Brett Rypien was an efficient 17 for 27 for 222 yards and the three scores, while running back Alexander Mattison added 145 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe Broncos came into the game looking to break Modster open, Rypien said\n\n\"He got some looks but at other times, it depended on what they were giving us,\" he said. \"He just did a good job of winning the one on ones. I think our other guys are going to be hungry now that Sean had three touchdowns. I'm sure there are some other guys in that room who are going to want some red zone action as well.\"\n\nBoise State limited the Lobos to 262 total yards and one touchdown, with the other touchdown coming on a punt return.\n\n\"I thought our defense did a fantastic job,\" Harsin said. \"They did move the ball because they're good and they have multiple ways they can attack you. We can tackle better. But our defense holding them to seven points is hard to do.\"\n\nThe Broncos took control of the game quickly, going 65 yards in 2:22, with Rypien hitting Modster from 15 yards out. By the end of the first quarter, the lead was up to 14-0, and Boise State led 24-7 at halftime.\n\n\"We had a hard time stopping them,\" New Mexico coach Bob Davie said. \"Although we did fight, but the three turnovers were big.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nThe Broncos' sixth straight win keeps them on track for a shot at the conference's Mountain Division championship and a berth in the Mountain West title game on Dec. 1.\n\nWith a sixth consecutive loss, New Mexico will miss a bowl for a second straight season after two consecutive bowl appearances. All that's left for the Lobos is to try and avoid a second straight, season-ending seven-game losing streak after starting both seasons 3-2.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nMarcus Hayes' 86-yard, fourth-quarter punt return for a touchdown was New Mexico's first since 2002, a total of 208 games. It was the second-longest drought in college football behind only Rice.\n\nDEATH\n\nFormer Boise State running back Jack Darrel Fields Jr., 25, was shot and killed Thursday evening following an altercation with a Richmond County (Ga.) Sheriff's Office deputy. He played with some of the older Broncos.\n\n\"I got the information (Friday) morning,\" Harsin said. \"Being a part of a team and you have guys on your team and you have things like that happen, it hurts, regardless of what happened. That was a hard thing (Friday) morning. We let the team know because it was out there and that was a hard thing the team had to deal with (Friday) morning, too.\"\n\nBUDDING POLITICIAN\n\nNew Mexico running back Daevon Vigilant, who had 23 yards and a touchdown, was elected to the student-body senate this week.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe win leaves Boise State well-positioned to continue its climb in poll, especially after No. 22 Boston College and No. 20 Kentucky took big falls last week.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoise State: Next plays No. 14 Utah State (which faces Colorado State on Saturday) on Nov. 24. The winner of that game will advance to the conference championship against either Fresno State or San Diego State.\n\nNew Mexico: Finishes its season at home against Wyoming on Nov. 24.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 When they were teammates, Nicklas Backstrom always had a tough time against Philipp Grubauer in practice.\n\nThe Washington Capitals veteran had better luck when they met as opponents Friday night.\n\nBackstrom was left uncovered on a 4-on-3 power play and scored 22 seconds into overtime to lift the Capitals over the Colorado Avalanche 3-2.\n\n\"I used to struggle scoring in practice against Grubauer,\" Backstram said. \"He was probably used to me passing, too. Tom (Wilson) gave me a good pass and I was able to get the shot off.\"\n\nAlex Ovechkin and Devante Smith-Pelly also scored for the Capitals, and Pheonix Copley stopped 24 shots.\n\nColin Wilson and Carl Soderberg scored for the Avalanche while Grubauer, acquired by Colorado in an offseason trade with Washington to bolster their depth at goalie behind Semyon Varlamov, had 26 saves.\n\nWith 2:44 left in the third period, Ian Cole fired a shot from between the circles that glanced off Copley's pads. The puck trickled out to the right side of the net, where Wilson tied it at 2.\n\nThe Capitals ended it on a 4-on-3 power play. Backstrom was left uncovered for a clean shot in the high slot that beat Grubauer on his stick side. Backstrom also had an assist.\n\n\"We drew a penalty and made the most of our chance,\" Ovechkin said.\n\nAvalanche coach Jared Bednar said he thought the Avalanche did not play with a sense of urgency early.\n\n\"Third period, different story,\" he said. \"We started ramping it up, that's why we generated some chances in the third and they didn't, because we were more desperate. I want us to play a whole game like we're down a goal and bring that desperation and urgency to the game.\"\n\nWith the score tied at 1, Tom Wilson started a rush and passed the puck ahead to Backstrom, who dished off to the streaking Ovechkin. He split defenders and let loose a wrist shot from the top of the right circle that sailed over Grubauer's glove at 18:29 of the second.\n\nSmith-Pelly pulled Washington Even 8:55 into the second off a cross-ice pass from Chandler Stephenson.\n\nColorado just missed adding a goal from Mark Barberio when his shot glanced off the right post at 11:01 of the second.\n\n\"A sloppy game by us,\" Colin Wilson said. \"They had more effort, a little more attention to detail. We turned it on in the last 10 minutes, but it was just too little, too late. Games like that, you want to eliminate them as much as possible. It wasn't an X's and O's thing, just effort.\n\n\"Coming out with a point is better than no points at all,\" Wilson added.\n\nNOTES: T.J. Oshie, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Braden Holtby were ruled out for the game against the Avalanche because of upper body injuries. They are all listed as day to day. ... The Avs remain one win shy of their 1,000th victory since moving to Denver from Quebec in 1995. The Avs 999 wins in that span include 897 in the regular season and 102 in the playoffs.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCapitals: Play at Montreal on Monday night.\n\nAvalanche: Visit Anaheim on Sunday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Once I got a few shots and settled in, it kind of felt like just another hockey game, trying to get a win\"\n\nPetersen made his NHL debut on Tuesday against Toronto, stopping 15 of 16 shots in relief of Peter Budaj after being recalled from the Kings' AHL affiliate in Ontario, California, on Monday. With his parents in the stands, Petersen was tested in spurts by Chicago, but was sharp when needed and came up with several close-in saves, outdueling Crawford.\n\nThe Kings are without their two top goalies, Jonathan Quick and Jack Campbell. Both are recovering from surgery to repair meniscus tears in one of their knees\n\nCrawford blocked 31 shots through overtime, but the struggling Blackhawks lost for the ninth time in their last 10 games (1-6-3).\n\nAlthough the Blackhawks came on late, they didn't test Petersen hard enough throughout the game, Kane said.\n\n\"All goalies are pretty much the same,\" Kane said. \"They're big. If they see the puck, they're probably going to stop it.\n\n\"(We needed to get) those side-to-side passes, especially against a guy who hasn't really played in the NHL before, getting him uncomfortable and getting some traffic in front.\"\n\nCarl Hagelin played his first games with the Kings. The 30-year-old forward was acquired in a deal that sent Tanner Pearson to Pittsburgh on Wednesday.\n\nThe Kings picked up the tempo near the end of scoreless first period and got a few good chances. Crawford stopped Toffoli point-blank with 5:30 left in the period, then denied Nate Thompson, who skated in with 1:20 to go.\n\nToffoli finally opened the scoring at 10:29 of the second following a Chicago turnover.\n\nChicago's Erik Gustafsson fell and lost the puck at the Los Angeles blue line. Toffoli picked it up, powered into the Chicago zone and beat Crawford between the legs when his shot from the slot deflected off defenseman Duncan Keith.\n\nBuoyed by three power plays in the second, Blackhawks started to test Petersen late in the period. He preserved the 1-0 lead with a quick save on Nick Schmaltz's one-timer from the slot during a Chicago power play with four minutes left in the second.\n\n\"I thought we got some energy off the power plays,\" said Chicago coach Jeremy Colliton, who is 1-2-2 since taking over for Joel Qunneville on Nov. 6. \"We had some chances but it didn't go in.\"\n\nSaad crashed into the crease and tied it 1-all at 2:39 of the third on Chicago's 21st shot, redirecting Jonathan Toews' feed from the side of the net past Petersen high on the glove side.\n\nCrawford made a toe save on a shot by Jeff Carter from the right circle with 1:21 left in regulation to keep it tied.\n\nPetersen stopped Gustav Forsling's tip-in attempt 2:21 into overtime. Anze Kopitar's shot hit the post about a minute later.\n\nNOTES: Petersen was drafted by the Kings in the fifth round, 129th overall in 2013. He once started 90 consecutive games for Notre Dame. ... Blackhawks C Marcus Kruger returned after missing three games with left leg injury. Chicago C Brandon Davidson was placed on injured reserve, retroactive to Nov. 13, with a right leg injury. ... Budaj was the Kings' backup goalie, but his availability was a game-time decision because of an illness. ... Quick has been out since Oct. 28, with a projected recovery period of four to six weeks. ... Campbell was injured last Saturday in a 1-0 loss to Calgary and his recovery also is expected to take four to six weeks.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKings: At Nashville on Saturday night.\n\nBlackhawks: Host Minnesota on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Vanderbilt won by 25 points, but it seemed like an off-night during much of the game.\n\nThat's how high expectations have become for the Commodores with their highly-touted recruiting class.\n\nFreshman Simi Shittu scored 20 points and senior Joe Toye added 14, and Vanderbilt beat Alcorn State 79-54 Friday night.\n\n\"I thought Alcorn played really well,\" Commodores coach Bryce Drew said. \"Early in the season when you face a lot of changing defenses, especially with a young team, it can keep you off balance. We just couldn't get into a rhythm offensively until about that 15-minute mark in the second half.\"\n\nShittu, a 6-foot-10 power forward, was a force inside, hitting 9 of 11 shots from the floor. He also blocked three shots for the 3-0 Commodores.\n\nVanderbilt freshman Darius Garland, who entered the game tied for second in scoring in the Southeastern Conference, was held to a season-low three points \u2014 18.5 below his average. The point guard missed 5 of 6 from the floor, but he had seven rebounds and four assists.\n\n\"We wanted to focus in on Garland and I thought defensively we did a great job holding a guy of his caliber to three points,\" Braves coach Montez Robinson said. \"We wanted to just try to take the ball out of his hands as much as possible. But when you take away a player like him you can't let other guys make up for it.\"\n\nShittu and Garland, both five star-prospects and McDonald's All-Americans, form the core of Vanderbilt's best recruiting class in school history.\n\nVanderbilt's Matt Ryan added 12 points as the Notre Dame transfer hit four 3-pointers. Saben Lee added 10 points and a game-high six assists.\n\nMatthew Moyer, who was granted an NCAA waiver earlier in the week, had a team-high eight rebounds and five points in his Vanderbilt debut after transferring from Syracuse in the summer.\n\nThe NCAA allowed the 6-foot-8 forward to play immediately instead of sitting out one year.\n\n\"Length, he brings energy as well,\" Shittu said when asked what Moyer can add to the lineup. \"Leadership because he's been to where we're trying to be this year. And he's a good teammate as well.\"\n\nTroymain Crosby led Alcorn State (1-2) with 11 points and Deshawn Andrews had 10. Maurice Howard, who scored a career-high 24 points in Alcorn State's previous game against Blue Mountain, was held to five points on 2 of 11 shooting.\n\nAlcorn State cut Vanderbilt's lead to 50-41 with 12:11 left, but the Commodores closed with a 29-13 run. The Braves shot 32 percent from the floor.\n\nVanderbilt had a 16-2 edge in fast-break points and a 42-22 advantage on points in the paint.\n\nVanderbilt couldn't find a steady rhythm in the first half, but still managed a 37-29 lead.\n\nAlcorn State faces another SEC team when it visits Mississippi State on Nov. 26.\n\nINJURED BRAVE\n\nAlcorn State's Alonzo Campbell, a 7-foot center, was helped off the court, favoring his right hip 19 seconds into the second half. \"I think it was a hip pointer,\" Robinson said. \"We won't know the depth of it until we get back. With something like that (he could be out) a couple of weeks maybe. I hope it's two weeks, it's a guessing game.\"\n\nSTILL CONTRIBUTING\n\nGarland still found ways to contribute even though his shots weren't falling. \"Obviously, we'd like him to score more, but he does so many things out there,\" Drew said. \"He controls the tempo. He only had four assists, but if we probably would have made more layups and 3's, he could have had 10 assists easily. Even when he's not scoring he's so important out there.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nAlcorn State: The Braves stayed within striking range until the Commodores pulled away late.\n\nVanderbilt: After demolishing the Braves by 39 points last season the Commodores got a much tougher battle this time, especially during the first 30 minutes.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAlcorn State visits Kent State Sunday in the second of a five straight road games.\n\nVanderbilt hosts Liberty on Monday in the second of a four-game homestand.\n\n---\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Richard W. Rodriguez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 Ben Bishop was as much a cheerleader as a goalie for Dallas in a scoreless overtime game.\n\n\"It's like, 'C'mon, let's score, guys,'\" he said.\n\nJason Dickinson obliged, burying a rebound 1:34 into overtime to preserve Bishop's 23-save shutout and lift the Stars over the Boston Bruins 1-0 on Friday night.\n\nDickinson and Mattias Janmark led a 2-on-1 against goalie Tuukka Rask. Janmark shot from the left side, and the rebound slid to Dickinson right in front. He lifted the puck in for his fourth of the season.\n\n\"I recognized that it was a 2-on-1 and I went to open up for (Janmark),\" Dickinson said. \"I noticed that he was shooting, and I figured I'd go to the side that he was shooting on because there might be a rebound.\n\n\"To be able to cap that off with an overtime winner from me, it feels really good.\"\n\nRask made 36 saves in his return from a week-long leave of absence for a personal matter. The Bruins have not elaborated on the reason for Rask's leave.\n\nBruins coach Bruce Cassidy wasn't blaming Rask.\n\n\"Overtime hasn't been our friend,\" Cassidy said. \"We don't manage the puck. We give up odd-man rushes. We don't deserve to win. Listen, you've got to defend when you don't have the puck.\"\n\nDallas won 1-0 in overtime or a shootout for the first time in franchise history. The Stars hadn't been in a scoreless overtime game since a 1-0 shootout loss to Los Angeles on March 26, 2009.\n\nThe Bruins had not ended regulation in a scoreless tie since April 12, 2012 \u2014 a 1-0 win to open a first-round playoff series against Washington.\n\nBishop got his 26th career shutout. His biggest save came midway through the second, when he stopped Joakim Nordstrom's deflection.\n\nCoach Jim Montgomery has been impressed with Dallas goalies Bishop and Anton Khudobin.\n\n\"It's a luxury,\" he said. \"It's been the most consistent and the best part of our game. What a gritty effort\"\n\nBoth sides were dealing with injuries to defenseman, so Boston had two players make their NHL debut in Jakub Zboril and Connor Clifton, and the Stars had one in Gavin Bayreuther.\n\n\"Obviously missing some bodies in the defense,\" Rask said. \"Everybody battled. We played a solid game and resulted in one point.\n\nDallas almost scored 49 seconds into the game. A tip-in by Tyler Pitlick went under and behind Rask, but defenseman Torey Krug moved the puck off the goal line with his stick.\n\nBoston's Brad Marchand had 16 of his 18 penalty minutes in the second period. He received a double minor for roughing in a fight with Radek Faksa at 7:45 and left the ice at 12:46 after drawing a slashing penalty and a misconduct.\n\n\"There were some fights out there, and guys sticking up for each other,\" Bishop said. \"They're not all Picassos. This one was a little different.\"\n\nFaksa's line held the Bruins' top line of Marchand, Patrice Bergeron and David Pastrnak to six shots on goal.\n\nDallas pressured Rask with 13 shots in the third period and six more in overtime.\n\nNOTES: Bergeron left the game in the third period with an upper-body injury. Cassidy said the center would be evaluated Saturday, but he doesn't expect Bergeron to play Saturday night. ... Marchand's 18 penalty minutes were his highest total since he had 19 in Boston's season opener at Washington. The Bruins totaled 33 penalty minutes, and the Stars had 19. ... There were so many players unavailable for Dallas that injured C Devin Shore was the only scratch. ... The Bruins have six injured defensemen after Zdeno Chara (knee) and John Moore (lower body) were hurt Wednesday at Colorado. ...

(AP) \u2014 Mississippi State's night turned sour after just 29 seconds when starting guard Nick Weatherspoon was rolling around on the floor, wincing in pain while clutching his sprained left ankle.\n\nThe Bulldogs looked shaken, falling behind early against a team they were supposed to beat easily. Thanks to Weatherspoon's replacement, things got better in a hurry.\n\nTyson Carter scored 17 points, including 13 points in the first half, to lead No. 17 Mississippi State past Long Beach State 79-51 on Friday for its third straight win to start the season.\n\nQuinndary Weatherspoon led the Bulldogs with 21 points. Lamar Peters added 16 points and four assists.\n\n\"We just had to pick up our intensity,\" Peters said. \"We came out flat. Those guys played really hard, came out and had a good run. We just didn't want to continue to play flat and take a quick loss early in the season.\"\n\nMississippi State trailed 28-21 with six minutes remaining in the first half, but Carter nailed a 3-pointer that sparked a 15-0 run. The Bulldogs started the second half on a 17-4 run to put the game away.\n\n\"We finally caught our breath and started to do a great job defensively, especially the last part of the first half,\" Mississippi State coach Ben Howland said.\n\nLong Beach State (1-3) was hurt by 20 turnovers. The 49ers were led by Bryan Alberts and KJ Byers, who both scored eight points. They shot just 28.6 percent in the second half.\n\n\"We let our offensive ineptness bleed into our defense and rebounding,\" Long Beach State coach Dan Monson said. \"They just broke our will. We played pretty well for 14 minutes, but you've got to play 40 and we just didn't do it today.\"\n\nMississippi State won despite shooting just 4 of 23 from 3-point range.\n\nPERRY PRODUCES\n\nFreshman forward Reggie Perry had a productive game with five points and a game-high 14 rebounds in just 20 minutes. The McDonald's All-American has quickly forced his way into Mississippi State's rotation and his 6-foot-10, 245-pound frame is rare for someone so young.\n\n\"I was really happy for Reggie,\" Howland said. \"Reggie is a very good rebounder. We keep stats every day in practice and he's been one of our top three rebounders the entire year in practice. You play like you practice.\"\n\nWEATHERSPOON'S INJURY\n\nNick Weatherspoon's ankle injury was his second of the season. He injured his other ankle in a closed scrimmage before the season started.\n\nHowland wasn't sure how much time Weatherspoon would miss.\n\n\"Hopefully he'll be back soon \u2014 I just have no way of knowing,\" Howland said. \"A lot of time with sprained ankles, it's how he does overnight and how you show up the next day. He didn't have a lot of swelling, which is a good sign.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLong Beach State: The 49ers got off to a great start, but were too sloppy with possessions against Mississippi State's intense man-to-man defense. LBSU has certainly been tested in its first few games, losing to UCLA, Arizona State and Mississippi State.\n\nMississippi State: It was a good recovery for the Bulldogs, who appeared shaken by Nick Weatherspoon's early injury. The Bulldogs will need more production from guards like Carter and Robert Woodard if Weatherspoon's injury keeps him out for an extended time.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLong Beach State faces Iona in Las Vegas on Monday.\n\nMississippi State faces Arizona State in Las Vegas on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Karen Pulfer Focht) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 On a night that veteran Marc Gasol became Memphis' career rebound leader, it was the Grizzlies' youngster who showed off his offensive skills.\n\nRookie Jaren Jackson Jr. scored a season-high 27 points, Gasol added 19 points and 15 rebounds and the Grizzlies defeated the Sacramento Kings 112-104 on Friday night.\n\n\"It means I've been here a long time,\" Gasol said laughingly deflecting talk of the rebounding record. \"If you play long enough and you're lucky enough, you're probably going to get some of those.\"\n\nJackson was the one who got the Grizzlies going early, as they built a 13-point lead. The 19-year-old from Michigan State was getting to the rim and converting as if the game plan was to use Jackson against the Kings front line.\n\nBut it was more circumstantial than an opening strategy.\n\n\"Once we saw (a) mismatch and that he was feeling good about it and he was finishing strong to the basket, we got him going,\" Gasol said.\n\nJackson added: \"That just comes from running the floor and making yourself open. It depends on how the game is going and how we feel it out. We don't really set our minds on anything.\"\n\nMike Conley added 19 points and six assists, while Garrett Temple finished with 14 points \u2014 missing only one of his six shots \u2014 as Memphis won its second straight. Gasol has 5,613 career rebounds, passing the franchise record of 5,612 by former Grizzlies standout Zach Randolph.\n\nDe'Aaron Fox led the Kings with 23 points and 10 assists, while backcourt mate Buddy Hield scored 16 points. Bogdan Bogdanovic and Iman Shumpert added 12 points for Sacramento.\n\n\"I think he just keeps taking steps forward,\" Kings coach Dave Joerger said of Fox. \"I think he will be hard on himself about having six turnovers. But I think he continues to improve.\"\n\nMemphis built the lead to 14 points in the third quarter, and held an 11-point advantage near the midway point of the final period. A pair of 3-pointers by Troy Williams around a basket by Fox tightened things up.\n\nThe Kings pulled within 107-104 with 1:55 left on a jumper by Fox, bringing the Memphis fans to their feet, as Joerger encouraged his team for another stop.\n\nBut Gasol converted a three-point play with 1:41 left. Two more free throws from Gasol with 34.9 seconds left provided the final margin.\n\nThe game was a conflict in tempo. Memphis tends to slow things down, while the Kings have been successful lately with a faster pace. In the second half, Sacramento outscored Memphis, but not enough to overcome a 62-51 Memphis lead at halftime.\n\n\"I think we got to it too late,\" Joerger said of increasing the pace. \"You have to try and speed teams like this up, and it's difficult to play from behind.\"\n\nFox added: \"They play so slow, and they get what they want. They get it where they want.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nKings: Randolph was at the game, but in street clothes. Randolph, who has been inactive for every Sacramento game this season, played for the Grizzlies eight seasons and still owns a house in Memphis. ... Hield and Fox were a combined 14 of 29 from the field, but Fox converted only one of his five shots from beyond the arc. ... Fox also committed six of Sacramento's 21 turnovers in the game.\n\nGrizzlies: Conley, an 83 percent free-throw shooter, missed four of his first eight from the line in the third quarter. ... Jackson's previous season high was 24 points against Atlanta on Oct. 19. He converted 11 of 16 shots.\n\nA FAMILY REUNION\n\nThere are usually plenty of connections between teams in an NBA game, but the ties between the Kings and Grizzlies is a bit more. Beyond Randolph's All-Star career with Memphis, Joerger was with the franchise nine years, the last three as head coach. Joerger readily admits he enjoys his return to the city. \"I love coming back here,\" he said, noting not only did his family grow up in Memphis, but he did also in regards to his career. He later added: \"I speak well of the Grizzlies. To my guys, the older guys, they're so classy.\"\n\nGASOL RECORD\n\nWhen Gasol grabbed his 15th rebound with little more than a minute left in the game, Randolph, in a suit rather than uniform, watched from the Kings bench as his former teammate surpassed his mark in the Grizzlies' record book. \"It had a little more motivation,\" Gasol said of breaking the record in front of Randolph. \"I wish he was on the floor, but I'm just happy he was watching.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKings: Travel to Houston on Saturday\n\nGrizzlies: Face the Timberwolves in Minnesota on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 If not for Anthony Davis' determination to dominate inside for most of his 40 minutes on the court, the New Orleans Pelicans could have been blown out by the New York Knicks.\n\nDavis scored a season-high 43 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, and New Orleans overcame an 11-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat New York 129-124 on Friday night.\n\n\"It felt like a grind,\" Davis said. \"Usually when I have those numbers, we're up 12, 15, 20. ... But they were up damn near the whole game. We just had to fight back and I was just trying to do my part.\"\n\nJulius Randle had 19 points and 11 rebounds, including a crucial put-back of Davis' missed free throw to make it 124-121 with 1:23 left.\n\n\"Julius saved me when I missed two free throws at the end,\" Davis said. \"When I missed (the second one), I kind of put my head down a little bit and I seen a blue jersey flying in. So when he made it, I said, 'Thank you.' I don't know where he came from, but wherever he came from, I appreciate it.\"\n\nAfter Tim Hardaway Jr. missed a 3 for the tie, Holiday hit from deep to widen New Orleans' lead to six with 35 seconds left.\n\nHoliday overcame a shaky, turnover-plagued start to finish with 24 points and 10 assists. His late heroics included a rebound of his own miss inside the final two minutes, after which he dribbled out to the perimeter and fed an alley-oop lob to Davis.\n\n\"He missed a lot of bunnies at the start of the game and he didn't let it take away from his aggressiveness,\" Randle said about Holiday. \"He just kept going. He made huge shots and plays down the stretch.\"\n\nThe Knicks fell to a fourth straight loss after controlling nearly all but the final six minutes of the game.\n\nHardaway scored 30 points, and Trey Burke had 24 on 10-fo-13 shooting for the Knicks. New York led by as many as 19 points in the first half before losing for the sixth time in seven games.\n\nEmmanuel Mudiay added 19 points. The Knicks shot 49 percent (48 of 98) but were outrebounded 54-44 and allowed the Pelicans to snag seven offensive rebounds and score eight second-chance points in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"We just couldn't come up with those rebounds at the end,\" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. \"We get them to miss the shot, but we don't come up with the loose ball. That happened multiple times down the stretch.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nKnicks: Kevin Knox and Allonzo Trier each scored 11 points. ... Center Mitchell Robinson, who is from the New Orleans suburb of Chalmette, had seven points and seven rebounds in 24 minutes. ...\n\nPelicans: Point guard Elfrid Payton returned to the lineup after missing nine games with a sprained right ankle, only to fracture a finger in his left hand after eight minutes on the court. He did not return to the game and missed all three of his shots before his latest injury. ... Nikola Mirotic had 12 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans. ... The Pelicans missed 24 of 34 3-point attempts and turned the ball over 15 times. ... New Orleans scored 68 points in the paint.\n\nSMALL BALL\n\nFizdale elected to start the 6-foot-5 Trier in place of 6-9 forward Noah Vonleh on the wing. He said change had more to do with his curiosity about how that smaller lineup would play together than trying to create specific matchups against New Orleans. The Knicks played at a faster pace and surpassed their 106 points-per-game average with nearly eight minutes left. That showing apparently earned the lineup another look, despite the loss.\n\n\"After tonight I can't switch this one up,\" Fizdale said. \"I have to give them a chance to see if they can keep some consistency.\"\n\nTALL BALL\n\nDavis said he and Randle were determined to get into the paint for shots and rebounds late when the Knicks remained with a smaller lineup.\n\n\"I really hate settling against smaller guys, so I just tried taking it inside, trying to get Julius to do the same thing,\" Davis said. \"There was nobody who could stop both of us on the inside. We just tried to make an effort to get down low and just punish them.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKnicks: Wrap up a three-game trip in Orlando on Sunday night.\n\nPelicans: Host Denver on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Bill Feig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Very little came easily for LSU in a back-and-forth game against Louisiana Tech.\n\nIt was up to freshman Ja'vonte Smart to bail out the 22nd-ranked Tigers. Smart scored 16 points, and his late 3-pointer put LSU ahead for good in a 74-67 victory on Friday night.\n\n\"We found a way to get it done,\" coach Will Wade said. \"At the end of the day, the goal was to be 4-0 and we're 4-0. We need to get better these next couple of days in practice. I did think our defense improved. We didn't move the ball as well as we needed to on offense, but we can get some of that stuff corrected.\"\n\nThe Bulldogs tied it at 62 on a jumper by Daquan Bracey with 2:29 remaining, but Smart hit his 3 on the next possession for the Tigers. LSU increased its lead to eight points on a layup by Kavell Bigby-Williams and three free throws by Skylar Mays.\n\nTremont Waters had 14 points for LSU, and Mays and Daryl Edwards each scored 12.\n\n\"I give a shout-out to Tremont for the assist on my 3-pointer,\" Smart said. \"I just stepped in and made the big shot. That's what players do. I am a freshman, but I will take the shot. I played good. Coach told me to just keep attacking and my teammates told me to just keep attacking.\"\n\nAnthony Duruji led the Bulldogs (3-1) with 22 points. Sophomore Exavian Christon matched his career high with 15 points and Amorie Archibald had 10.\n\nArchibald's 3-pointer brought Louisiana Tech within 70-65 with 31 seconds remaining, but Waters and Edwards each hit a pair of free throws to seal the victory.\n\n\"We came here to compete and our guys fully expected to come in and win,\" Louisiana Tech coach Eric Konkol said. \"We're disappointed we fell short of that. It was the turnovers (17) for us. We left a lot of shots out on the court by not taking care of the basketball enough.\"\n\nLSU led by as many as nine points in the first half, but Louisiana Tech closed within 36-33 at the break.\n\nThe Bulldogs took an eight-point lead with 12:39 remaining in the game. Duruji had nine points as Louisiana Tech outscored LSU 21-10 to start the second half. The Tigers responded with a 16-4 run to go ahead 62-58. Waters had five points during that stretch.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLSU: The Tigers were outrebounded and shot poorly from the free throw line (11 of 19) and from 3-point range (5 of 24), but they found a way to improve to 4-0 for the first time in six seasons.\n\nLSU limited Louisiana Tech to nine points in the final 8:57. The Bulldogs missed nine of their final 12 field-goal attempts.\n\nLouisiana Tech: The Bulldogs had their chance of coming away with a second impressive road victory in the first two weeks of the season. Louisiana Tech, which won at Wichita State in its season opener, scored only nine points in the final eight-plus minutes.\n\nINJURIES\n\nNaz Reid, LSU's leading scorer at 19 points per game, did not start and was on the court for only 10 minutes because of an ankle injury. He scored four points.\n\nLouisiana Tech lost Christon to a leg injury with 5:16 remaining in the game. Bracey, who was the Bulldogs' top scorer in their season-opening victory against Wichita State, had missed the two previous games. Bracey played 18 minutes against the Tigers and scored only two points.\n\nHOME STREAK\n\nLSU extended its home-court winning streak to 11 games, its longest since it won 14 in a row in the 2007-08 and 2008-09 seasons.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLSU will play away from home for the first time when it meets Charleston in a first-round game of the Advocare Invitational Tournament in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday.\n\nLouisiana Tech returns home to play NAIA member Tougaloo on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I think they play the game the right way.\"\n\nJorgensen and Baldwin also make the Bulldogs especially tough to beat.\n\nButler is 3-0 for the fifth time in six years and the first time since Jordan returned to his alma mater last season and extended the nation's third longest home winning streak against nonconference foes to 46. Only Duke and Arizona have longer streaks than Butler's, which dates to the 2012 postseason.\n\nAnd the streak survived largely because of Jorgensen's incredible start \u2014 he made his first five shots including three from 3-point range while scoring 14 of Butler's first 19 points \u2014 and Baldwin, who wound up making all 12 of his free throws on a night he finished 5 of 17 from the field.\n\nThe combination simply proved too much for Mississippi (1-1), which spent most of the night hanging around despite being saddled with foul trouble. Terence Davis went 6 of 9 on 3s and had 30 points while Breein Tyree added 17 points \u2014 not quite enough as the Rebels lost for the 12th time in 13 trips away from their Oxford campus.\n\n\"Jorgensen got them off to such a good start and we made so many defensive mistakes,\" new coach Kermit Davis said. \"And we just couldn't keep them off the free-throw line in the last eight minutes.

Tyree's driving layup with 5:50 put the Rebels up 68-63.\n\nFinally, Baldwin and the Bulldogs answered. Aaron Thompson's three-point play was followed by Christian David's spectacular block of 7-foot Dominik Oljeniczak and led to a midrange jumper from Baldwin. The run continued with Nate Fowler's layup off a pass from Thompson and ended with two free throws from Baldwin to make it 72-68.\n\nButler closed it out with Jorgensen's final 3, with 1:14 left, and the perfect free-throw shooting \u2014 an image they hope to duplicate throughout the season.\n\n\"It was great for him to come out there and shoot like that,\" Baldwin said, referring to Jorgensen. \"It's what we've been waiting on, and we'll see more of it, hopefully, during the season.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMississippi: The Rebels were competitive most of the night but simply lacked the depth to close it out, especially on a night they were in foul trouble.\n\nButler: The Bulldogs are tough to beat at Hinkle Fieldhouse most nights and are virtually unbeatable there against nonconference foes.

Then the home team kept them cheering with a defensive effort that would've made the Wolves icon \u2014 a ferocious defender in his prime \u2014 proud.\n\n\"It was great to see him,\" Karl-Anthony Towns said. \"It was a long conversation with me and him to get him to come. So I'm happy he came and we played really well as a team.\n\n\"All he wants to do is see Minnesota succeed, so I'm just happy we gave him something to cheer about.\"\n\nThe Wolves entered the game allowed opposing teams to score an average of 116.2 points per game. They held the Blazers \u2014 who were averaging 115.9 per game \u2014 to their season low.\n\nTowns and Robert Covington each had 14 points for the Wolves, who are 7-1 at home and 3-0 since trading the disgruntled Butler to Philadelphia on Monday.\n\nRose cautioned against reading too much into the success.\n\n\"We're still trying to figure things out,\" he said. \"It's always great to go 3-0, and we're just trying to keep it going, taking it one game at a time.\"\n\nThe Timberwolves' lineup had a balanced night, with all five starters scoring in double figures.\n\nIt was a stark difference from the last time the teams met nearly two weeks ago, when the Blazers held Minnesota to 81 points \u2014 the lowest point total in the NBA this season. The Wolves were without Butler, Jeff Teague and Rose for that game.\n\n\"I just think they have a new feel, a new lease on life in a sense,\" Evan Turner said. \"Anytime you get a trade and things like that, they feel good. They played well.\"\n\nLOSING ON THE TRAIL\n\nThe Blazers have their first losing streak of the season \u2014 not the start they wanted for their six-game trip.\n\nCJ McCollum had 18 points and Damian Lillard added 16 for Portland, which never led. The Blazers got within six in the third quarter before Minnesota closed the period on a 21-11 run by attacking the basket. The Blazers committed 18 turnovers, leading to 22 Wolves points.\n\n\"The ball is in my hands a lot and the team counts on me to take care of the ball and make sure that we get quality possessions. I didn't do a great job of that,\" said Lillard, who had five turnovers.\n\nTHE COLOR PURPLE\n\nThe Wolves debuted their \"city edition\" uniforms that pay homage to hometown music legend Prince, who filmed his iconic nightclub scenes of the 1984 movie Purple Rain across the street from where Target Center was later built. Prince music played all night.\n\n\"I know our players are really excited about the uniforms and the night. It's a great way to honor Prince,\" coach Tom Thibodeau said.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTrail Blazers: Lillard had five assists to pass Damon Stoudamire (3,018) for third on the team's career list. He has 3,020 for his career. ... G Seth Curry sat out with a bruised right knee from the first quarter of Wednesday night's loss to the Lakers. Curry said Thursday his goal was to return during the team's current six-game road trip.\n\nTimberwolves: Taj Gibson had a season-high five assists, and Teague had a game-high eight. . F Anthony Tolliver didn't play for the second straight game. He told local media Friday that Thibodeau didn't talk to him about not playing in Wednesday night's win against New Orleans. Thibodeau, known for playing with a short bench, defended the decision to not play the usually reliable veteran. \"If you try to play too many then everyone plays poorly. So you try to make a decision, you gather information and it usually works out.

(AP) \u2014 Lagerald Vick had declared for the NBA draft and Kansas had moved on without him, recruiting a trio of backcourt players to take his place and planning for the upcoming season.\n\nThen Vick changed his mind and returned for his senior year.\n\nGood thing for the Jayhawks.\n\nVick hit seven 3-pointers and had a career-high 33 points Friday night, following up his 32-point outburst against Vermont earlier in the week, and top-ranked Kansas needed just about every bit of his hot shooting to finally turn away Louisiana-Lafayette in an 89-76 victory.\n\n\"I guess they're glad he stayed,\" Ragin' Cajuns coach Bob Marlin said.\n\nVick also had nine rebounds for the Jayhawks (3-0), while big men Dedric Lawson and Udoka Azubuike came alive down the stretch. Lawson had 19 points in a strong bounce-back from his scoreless dud against the Catamounts, and Azubuike finished with 17 points, eight boards and four blocks.\n\n\"We're just going to keep feeding the hot hand until it runs out,\" said Lawson, who made a shot from his backside early in the game. \"(Vick) and Udoka, they've both been playing well.\"\n\nJustin Miller scored all 22 of his points in the first half to lead four players in double figures for Louisiana-Lafayette (1-2), which has only beaten one top-five team in school history. JaKeenan Gant added 18 points, Malik Marquetti scored 14 and Cedric Russell finished with 10.\n\n\"They said it happened five times \u2014 I'm not sure if it was five but it felt like 10 \u2014 where we had transition numbers and missed it and they shot a 3 at the other end and made it,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said. \"If it happened five times, that's a 25-point difference in a span of 10 seconds of what it might have been. We have to eliminate that.\"\n\nIndeed, Miller and the Ragin' Cajuns had the Jayhawks on the ropes most of the way.\n\nTaking advantage of Kansas' slow start, Louisiana-Lafayette ripped off an early 15-2 run that was capped by a five-point trip down the floor. Gant knocked down a 3-pointer, Self lit into an official to earn a technical foul, and Marcus Stroman hit both the free throws to give the reigning regular-season Sun Belt champs a 32-20 lead with about 10 minutes left in the first half.\n\nThe Jayhawks finally woke up with a 10-0 run of their own. Then, after Miller hit his fourth 3 of the half, Kansas went on another brief run to take a 44-41 lead into the break.\n\nIt was a two-man show at that point: Miller had scored all his points while Vick had 18.\n\nMiller cooled down in the second half but the Ragin' Cajuns refused to go away, even when foul trouble set in. The Jayhawks were clinging to a 65-64 lead with 8:40 to go when they started to pound the ball inside, taking advantage of their size for the first time all game.\n\nLawson and Azubuike combined to score 16 straight before Vick, who was 8 for 8 from beyond the arc against the Catamounts, poured in his final 3-pointer to give himself a new career high.\n\n\"Just having a whole lot of energy,\" Vick said. \"My teammates are finding me for open shots and really just going out there and having fun. Just leaving it all out there.\"\n\nPROFESSIONAL FANS\n\nKansas City Chiefs linebackers Anthony Hitchens, Reggie Ragland and Ben Niemann were in the crowd ahead of their showdown with the Rams on Monday night in Los Angeles. Sporting Kansas City captain Matt Besler also was in attendance before heading to Portland for the MLS Western Conference finals Sunday.\n\nLES-LESS PHOG\n\nThere was a buzz all afternoon that Kansas was close to hiring Les Miles to replace fired football coach David Beaty, but no announcement came and the former Oklahoma State and LSU coach was not at Allen Fieldhouse.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Kyrie Irving had 11 straight Boston points down the stretch and scored 17 in all in the last 8:06 of the fourth quarter.\n\nThen in overtime, he really turned it on.\n\nThe Celtics guard made or assisted on every basket in the extra period, finishing with 11 assists and a season-high 43 points on Friday night to lead Boston to a 123-116 victory over the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\"Man, he made some shots tonight where you're just like, 'Wow,'\" forward Gordon Hayward said. \"You catch yourself being a fan. When he gets into that mode, the whole arena knew where we were going, and so did the Raptors. They just couldn't stop him.\"\n\nIt was the first time Irving has scored at least 40 points with 10 or more assists in a game. He was the first player do it in the NBA this year, and the first Celtics player since Antoine Walker in 2001.\n\n\"Kyrie did a great job in the fourth quarter knocking down shots,\" said Kawhi Leonard, who scored 31 points and had a season-high 15 rebounds for Toronto. \"We fought hard tonight, they played a better game and we've just got to keep playing better.\"\n\nJayson Tatum had 21 points and seven rebounds for the Celtics, who evened the season series at one game apiece against the only team to finish above them in the Eastern Conference last season. The home team has won nine straight matchups.\n\nSerge Ibaka scored 21 and Pascal Siakam had 16 points and nine rebounds for the Raptors, who have lost three straight since opening the season with 12 victories in their first 13 games. Toronto never led in overtime.\n\n\"It was just a veteran game out there, just great competition for a Friday night in the NBA,\" Irving said. \"You've got to appreciate that, two great teams going at it. And I'm pretty sure we'll see them down the road.\"\n\nHEY, HEY!\n\nHayward scored 15 points and had five rebounds and five assists in a team-high 39 minutes \u2014 by far his biggest workload since the injury that knocked him out in the first quarter of the first game last season.\n\n\"I was wondering if they were going to take me out of the game,\" he said. \"Happy that he left me in. It felt good to play that many minutes. It's been such a long time. It was a good confidence-builder.\"\n\nHayward hit a pair of free throws to open the overtime, Ibaka answered with a jumper and from there it was all Celtics. Hayward scored on a pass from Irving, then Irving rescued Tatum from a near-turnover and drove for the layup to give Boston a 113-109 lead.\n\nThe Raptors never got closer than three points after that.\n\n\"Not too often during the regular season we get to have games like this,\" Irving said. \"A great test for your team on both ends of the basketball floor, a great player in that other locker room, the competition and the level of play raises and you've just got to appreciate that.\"\n\nEND OF REGULATION\n\nToronto led by eight early in the fourth quarter and still had a 107-103 lead with 90 seconds left. But Tatum dunked to cut the deficit to two points and Siakam was called for pushing while going for a rebound, sending Hayward to the line for the game-tying free throws.\n\nLeonard had a chance to win it at the end of regulation, but his long jumper went off the rim.\n\n\"The main thing is we're going to hold it until the very last shot so that nothing bad happens and they can't get a rebound and call a timeout,\" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \"It's just man on man and you hope your guy can make the basket and we have a lot of faith in him that he can.\"\n\nDUCK\n\nLate in the third quarter, Kyle Lowry got Tatum in the air with a fake and then tried to duck under him as the Celtics forward came over the top. But Tatum wound up kicking him in the head as he came back down.\n\nLowry went to the floor but remained in the game and made both free throws to give Toronto a 78-68 lead their first double-digit advantage of the game.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nIrving surpassed the 10,000 point and the 2,500 assist milestones. ... After going 1-4 on a road trip, the Celtics have won two in a row at home. ... Toronto's OG Anunoby left the game in the third quarter with a sprained right wrist. ... The Raptors already beat Boston 113-101 on Oct. 19. The teams, which have won 11 of the last 12 Atlantic Division championships, will play twice more.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRaptors: Visit the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night.\n\nCeltics: Host the Utah Jazz on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And even when they did, making them was harder to do away from their home court. The Bulldogs needed the long-range shooting to keep up with the bigger Longhorns, and simply didn't get enough of it.\n\n\"They did an awesome job locking in on our shooters,\" Bulldogs coach Duggar Baucom said. \"Competition was a little bit different tonight.\"\n\nTexas: The Longhorns have padded their schedule with three easy wins and an overtime struggle against Arkansas. Their size advantage inside helped them overcome bad 3-point shooting early when Texas post players started gobbling rebounds and getting dunks and layups. That won't be nearly so easy going forward, especially in the Big 12.\n\nSPARKLING TRANSFER\n\nTexas got another good spark from Mount St. Mary's transfer junior guard Eli Mitrou-Long. The game was tied 16-16 before Mitrou-Long made a 3-pointer, finished a fast break with a nifty pass fake and layup, then forced a turnover that led to another basket in a 10-0 Texas run over a two-minute stretch.\n\n\"A great term for him is catalyst,\" Smart said. \"That's what we need him to be. Eli's a guy who is very, very emotional. When he can channel that the right way, he can be huge for us.\"\n\nKEEPING IT CLEAN\n\nTexas had another excellent game protecting the ball with just seven turnovers.

(Photo: Robert Laberge, Getty Images)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 An underdog driver for an underfunded team celebrated a storybook season ending with an improbable championship.\n\nBrett Moffitt won the Trucks Series championship for Hattori Racing, a tiny team stretched so thin financially there were times the organization wasn't sure it could complete this season. But Moffitt, practically a journeyman in NASCAR at age 26, put together the year that made it impossible for the little team to quit.\n\nMoffitt sealed the championship with a win, his sixth of the season, Friday night in the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. He won last week at Phoenix to put his Toyota team in the final four and they outperformed their higher-funded rivals to win the title by winning the race.\n\n\"I didn't want any drama here, I just wanted a party,\" Moffitt said. \"This year was no easy feat. I don't think people understand how serious things were here. We had a good year, but a championship really put an exclamation point on the year.\"\n\nIt made for a sweet celebration for Moffitt and team owner Shigeaki Hattori, a former driver who dabbled in the Truck Series and Indy cars before turning his focus to team ownership. Both driver and owner have bounced around NASCAR, and this was just the second full season for Hattori's team. Moffitt in 2015 was the top rookie of NASCAR's Cup Series, but he's never been able to land a secure and stable ride.\n\nNot even this season, one in which the team dominated, locked anything down for the future.\n\nHattori is still looking for sponsorship to keep his team afloat; Moffitt has no concrete plans for 2019.\n\n\"We don't have what some of the other teams have budget-wise, but we've got the best people,\" crew chief Scott Zipadelli said. \"I just hope we can keep it going.\"\n\nMoffitt made his national debut in 2012 and was in the Cup Series three years later. Veteran drivers insist Moffitt is of the highest talent \u2014 they call him a \"wheelman\" \u2014 and that proper equipment is the only thing holding him back. He's bounced around for six years to get to this level \u2014 an improbable championship that should land him a promotion to a bigger race team.\n\nFor Hattori, the victory proved upstart teams can scratch and claw their way into becoming a competitive NASCAR team. With the right combination of people, the team overcame its limitations.\n\n\"We all know the story by now where we didn't know if we were going to race the full year, I didn't know if I was going to have the opportunity to compete for a championship even after we got our first win,\" Moffitt said. \"Everyone pulled together hard here.\"\n\nAs his team chugged along, Moffitt credited dedicated sponsors \"that came in at clutch moments and got us to the race track.\"\n\nNoah Gragson was the championship runner-up and finished third in the race. Gragson drove for Toyota-backed Kyle Busch Motorsports, the top team in NASCAR and heavy favorite to win the championship.\n\nMyatt Snider won rookie of the year driving for ThorSport Racing.\n\nChevrolet won its ninth manufacturer championship, but first in the Trucks Series since 2012.\n\nThe championship trophy was presented to Moffitt by Ben Kennedy, the great grandson of NASCAR founder Bill France. Kennedy is a former driver who only recently moved into the leadership side of his family business and his role in the post-race ceremony was indicative of the changing of the guard in NASCAR.\n\nResults\n\nSaturday At Homestead-Miami Speedway Homestead, Fla.\n\nLap length: 1.50 miles (Start position in parentheses)\n\n1.

Russell scored eight of those points \u2014 five from the foul line \u2014 and found Joe Harris and Allen Crabbe for 3-pointers.\n\nWashington briefly got back within eight, but the Nets reclaimed a double-digit lead and kept it throughout the fourth quarter.\n\n\"We didn't make shots,\" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \"We turned the ball over and gave them a lot of opportunities. But defensively, we could not stay in front of the basketball.\"\n\nCARIS COMING WITH?\n\nAtkinson is hopeful LeVert will be able to join the team on the road in the near future.\n\n\"Not right now, but I'd say soon,\" Atkinson said of LeVert's ability to travel. \"He's kind of walking around.\"\n\nMID-RANGE MENTALITY\n\nBeal said part of his team's shooting struggles Friday came from overthinking whether to take the mid-range jumpers Brooklyn was inviting.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing with us is we just got to be confident in everything we do,\" Beal said. \"No matter what shot it is, man. A 3, a layup, a floater. Just be confident in everything we do.

In 1982, researchers discovered that infected blacklegged ticks transmitted the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium to humans, causing an infection with fever, headache and fatigue that can spread to joints, the heart and nervous system if left untreated.\n\n\"Patients are still having difficulties, and doctors are having problems trying to treat them,\" she said. \"I hope this will be an eye-opener for Congress.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, the infection afflicted two of Smith's daughters, one of whom missed four years of school. She founded the nonprofit Lyme Disease Association and has traveled the country to raise awareness.\n\n\"Now the big question is, what is Congress going to do in light of these recommendations?\u201d she said.\n\nBecause of the difficulty testing for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease \u2013 false positives and false negatives are common \u2013 the working group said additional research into diagnosing all tick-borne diseases can save the country money in the long run.\n\n\u25ba June 12: Tick paralysis: 5-year-old suddenly couldn't walk, had trouble speaking\n\n\u25ba May 23: What you need to know about tick diseases, how to remove them\n\nRep.

The report outlines the shortcomings of the standard practice of testing for Lyme through \u201cserological assays,\u201d or blood tests that look for antibodies.

Those diagnosed later may end up with chronic Lyme disease and still have problems even after the infection is cured.\n\nThe report recommends federal investment into the development of new testing techniques.

Y'all, we, have some great fans. Y'all have the catchiest song. I used to sing it in my head when I came in here.\"\n\nThe Jazz rallied after a rough first quarter and the teams went back-and-forth in the fourth quarter. Jae Crowder's put-back after Ricky Rubio's stole the ball and missed a lay-up gave Utah a 107-105 lead with 1:37 left. JJ Redick tied it on a pair of free throws.

They add up against a team like this.\"\n\nAfter the Jazz made the first basket, Butler scored on a reverse layup to begin a 12-0 run. He also nailed a 3-pointer during that stretch as Philadelphia dominated early.\n\nBut Utah closed to 54-52 at halftime following Derrick Favors' alley-oop dunk.\n\nRedick and Mike Muscala hit consecutive 3s early in the third quarter. However, the Jazz came back and went up 81-80 on Mitchell's jumper late in the quarter.\n\n\"Up until the end, we made a few mistakes, but we played passionate,\" Mitchell said. \"Honestly, they're a great team, but we had the game in the bag except for a few mistakes. I think the game just got away.\"\n\nMUTUAL ADMIRATION\n\nSimmons and Butler already have developed chemistry and enjoy playing with each other.\n\nSimmons on Butler: \"He knows how to play the game at a high level.

He also matched his season best by shooting 5 of 7 from 3-point range.\n\n\"Really what I wanted him to do was relax and not think too much out on the floor,\" McMillan said. \"I kind of felt like he was robotic out there.\"\n\nBojan Bogdanovic had 16 points and six rebounds and Domantas Sabonis added 15 points and 12 rebounds off the bench for the Pacers, playing the first of three games in four nights at home.\n\nJosh Richardson scored 28 points, including 7 of 10 from beyond the arc, and Hassan Whiteside had 12 points and 17 rebounds for the Heat, losers in four of their last five games.\n\nThe Pacers used a 16-0 run in the second quarter to take the lead for good. Indiana did just enough in the second half to fend off its Eastern Conference rivals.\n\nSabonis converted a three-point play with 7:24 left in the second quarter to give the Pacers a 34-32 lead, and they led the rest of the way.\n\nThe win comes a week after the Pacers rallied to beat the Heat 110-102 in Miami, closing out the victory with a 16-2 run that included the final 12 points.\n\nMiami was unable to return the favor in the second of three regular-season meetings between the teams.\n\n\"We just forgot how to play for a little bit,\" Richardson said. \"Everything was falling for them and they were attacking us, and we just weren't retaliating fast enough.\"\n\nBam Adebayo made a lay-up at the start of the fourth quarter that pulled the Heat within three, but the Pacers scored seven straight and extended the lead to 79-69 on a fast-break dunk by Bogdanovic with 9:21 remaining.\n\nThe Heat cut the lead again with a late 7-0 run, including a layup and 3-pointer by Richardson to make it 92-89 with 1:27 left. Victor Oladipo answered with a 3-pointer that put Miami away for good.\n\nIndiana trailed by as many as 12 points in the opening quarter before going on a 10-2 run at the start of the second.\n\nEvans made two 3-pointers and a pair of free throws in Indiana's go-ahead run. The Pacers took a 12-point lead when Cory Joseph hit a 3 to make it 44-32 with 5:14 left in the first half.\n\nIndiana led 50-43 at halftime\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHeat: Whiteside has finished with a double-double in each of the last six games. ... Rodney McGruder had 11 points and five rebounds. ... G Dwyane Wade missed his sixth straight game for personal reasons after the recent birth of his daughter.\n\nPacers: Indiana has won 12 of the last 13 regular-season home games against the Heat. ... Oladipo finished with eight points after scoring 20 or more in each of the previous 13 games.\n\nQUICK START\n\nWhiteside had eight points in the first quarter, but didn't score again until a layup with 7:26 remaining in the third quarter. Still, he's found a way to put up big numbers in recent games. He's averaging 15.7 points, 15.3 rebounds and 3.7 blocks over the last six games.\n\nBACK ON TRACK AT HOME\n\nThe Pacers lost against Houston and Philadelphia in their previous two home games, before beating the Heat and avoiding losing three straight at home for the first time since December last season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHeat: Home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.\n\nPacers: Home against Atlanta on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA andhttps://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She steadied that boat,\" he said of his wife.\n\nBut, Trump has changed the country, he said. The Republican party under Trump, Conway said, has become \"a personality cult\" and it was so bad that he switched parties.\n\n\"I don\u2019t feel comfortable being a Republican anymore,\" he told Yahoo News, adding he would rather move to Australia than vote for Trump again.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/16/george-conway-kellyanne-donald-trump-administration-dumpster-fire/2030909002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Tubby Smith gets first win, High Point beats S.

He has ranked among Northwestern's top two scorers in all three games. A surgery in the offseason corrected a lung problem, and the difference in his game is clear.\n\n\"I'm not surprised by it. That's how Vic's been all summer and fall. He's gearing up because he knows this is his last go-around,\" Collins said. \"We're in our new building, we've got a bunch of new guys, and he knows there's a lot on his plate, to be our leader night in and night out.\"\n\nNorthwestern started strong, getting out to a 9-0 lead. Turner showed off fancy moves in the first half, including a smooth finger roll that also earned him a trip to the free-throw line when he was fouled. Even when Turner missed, he created scoring opportunities. In the first half, Turner shook off a defender, missed what should have been an easy layup, and Barrett Benson was there for the putback.\n\nEveryone played a part in Northwestern's rout. Highly touted freshman Pete Nance scored 10 points off the bench. After notching a double-double on Monday night, Derek Pardon scored 10 points with nine rebounds. Benson had career highs of 12 points and 14 rebounds for the first double-double of his career.\n\n\"It's almost been like every night, it's a different guy. Tonight it was Barrett and Pete.

Show led Binghamton (1-3) with 15 points. It's the Bearcats' first game since head coach Tommy Dempsey signed a two-year contract extension earlier this week. Top returning rebounder Thomas Bruce is still not able to play after suffering a concussion in September. The Bearcats miss him. Northwestern outrebounded Binghamton 46-30.\n\nSTAT OF THE NIGHT:\n\nNorthwestern held Binghamton to 22-percent shooting from the field in the first half, including 1 of 12 from the 3-point line. While the Bearcats' shooting improved in the second half, they still only managed two 3-pointers in eight tries after intermission.\n\nPARDON?\n\nThe new Welsh-Ryan Arena hosted ESPN's \"Pardon the Interruption\" before the game. Binghamton alumnus Tony Kornheiser hosted the show with Michael Wilbon, a Northwestern alumnus. The two stuck around to call the game for ESPNews.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nBinghamton: Playing without Bruce will continue to cause problems as the Bearcats head into a tough nonconference schedule. Notre Dame and No. 18 Michigan are both on the docket before starting play in the America East.\n\nNorthwestern: Head coach Chris Collins said after the season-opening win that defense will be the team's calling card, and his Wildcats showed it again on Friday night.

I have the utmost respect for Coach Applewhite and I appreciate the support of Coach Applewhite and my teammates during this time. I love my brothers, my team and my city and I'm looking forward to moving forward with them together. Go Coogs!\"\n\nOliver angrily shouted at Applewhite and had to be held back by from the coach by a Houston staffer as they walked off the field. Applewhite said later Oliver was upset because the coach had told the player to remove the black winter coat he was wearing on the sideline. Applewhite said the coats are reserved for active players.\n\nOliver has missed the last four games with a knee injury and was not in uniform against Tulane. His status for the next week's game is uncertain.\n\n\"Last night was not indicative of his character and it was a passionate moment within our program,\" Applewhite said in the statement. \"We can, and we will, both learn from this situation as we move forward together.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Point guard Cane Broome wasn't overly concerned when the Bearcats opened the game in another shooting slump.\n\n\"If we're not making shots and we stop them, then nobody's going to score,\" Broome said.\n\nIt always comes back to defense and rebounding for Cincinnati, and the Bearcats had enough of both to get another win on Friday night. Trevon Scott and Nysier Brooks each had a double-double, and Cincinnati broke open a close game in the second half for a 74-63 victory over Milwaukee.\n\n\"Bearcat basketball,\" Scott said.\n\nBroome had a team-high 17 points, and the Bearcats finished with five players in double figures. Scott had 15 points and 10 rebounds, while Brooks got 12 and 10 \u2014 the first set of Cincinnati players with double-doubles since Gary Clark and Kyle Washington pulled it off at Iowa State on Dec. 1, 2016.\n\n\"That's at the top of our priority list, that's No. 1 to anything \u2014 rebounding,\" Scott said.\n\nBroome struggled with his shot during an opening 64-56 home loss to Ohio State and didn't start the next game, a 73-51 win over North Carolina Central . He made 8 of 12 shots on Friday, regaining some confidence.\n\n\"I mean, it wasn't like I was in the tank,\" Broome said. \"But you want to make shots. It was in the back of my head.\"\n\nCincinnati point guard Justin Jenifer had a stomach virus and didn't play, costing Cincinnati its best perimeter defender. Coach Mick Cronin wasn't happy with the way Milwaukee shot 52 percent in the first half .\n\n\"Defense is \u2014 for the 9 millionth time \u2014 my concern,\" Cronin said. \"A lot of defensive breakdowns. We're getting beat off the dribble, getting lost, not a lot of talk and communication, not a lot of intensity.\"\n\nCarson Warren-Newsome had 18 points for Milwaukee (0-4), which was outrebounded 37-25. The Panthers are 0-4 for the first time since 1994-95, when they dropped their first seven games.\n\nThe Panthers opened the game with a 12-3 run, making five of their first seven shots, and kept it close most of the way.\n\nThe Panthers led 49-48 when Jarron Cumberland made a 3-pointer, Broome hit a pull-up jumper, and Cumberland made a floater in the lane for a six-point lead the Bearcats wouldn't relinquish. Broome added a pair of baskets that pushed the lead to 11 points.\n\n\"You just have to commend our guys for coming in to such a tough environment and playing as hard as they did,\" coach Pat Baldwin said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMilwaukee: The Panthers were coming off a pair of one-possession losses \u2014 63-60 against North Dakota and 86-83 at Florida International . They kept it close again on Friday before going cold, managing only three baskets over 10 minutes as the Bearcats took control.\n\n\"We're close,\" Baldwin said. \"Like I told them, it's a matter of details in what we're trying to get accomplished \u2014 what we need to get to. Once we get there, I think we're going to be fine.\"\n\nCincinnati: The Bearcats remain prone to long stretches of struggling on offense. They managed only three points in the first 6 minutes, going 1 of 8. By contrast, the Panthers hit open shots.\n\n\"Our defensive intensity wasn't where it needed to be,\" Broome said.\n\nSLIM SERIES\n\nMilwaukee and Cincinnati have played only one other time since the Panthers moved up to Division I for the 1990-91 season. Cincinnati won 93-60 during the 1991-92 season.\n\nDOMINATING THE HORIZON\n\nCincinnati is 43-3 all-time against current members of the Horizon League. The three losses have come against Detroit (2) and UIC (1).\n\nAT THE LINE\n\nMilwaukee didn't shoot a free throw in the first half, when Cincinnati was called for three fouls. The Panthers finished 4 of 7 from the line, while Cincinnati went 12 of 20.\n\nNO DOUBLE THIS TIME\n\nMilwaukee's DeAndre Abram was coming off his second double-double in the loss at Florida International. The Bearcats held him to 10 points on 4-of-11 shooting along with three rebounds.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMilwaukee returns home for the first of two games in the Basketball Hall of Fame Belfast Classic, facing LIU Brooklyn on Tuesday.\n\nCincinnati hosts Western Michigan on Monday, completing a set of four straight home games to open the season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 The ball came Seventh Woods' way in transition and he didn't hesitate.\n\nThe North Carolina junior immediately flipped the ball behind his back to Cameron Johnson for a corner 3-pointer, one of several blowout-producing baskets for the seventh-ranked Tar Heels after halftime in Friday night's 108-58 win against Tennessee Tech.\n\nIt was part of an encouraging night for UNC (4-0) at the point, where Woods and freshman starter Coby White need to develop into reliable tempo-pushing floor leaders if the Tar Heels are going to contend for an Atlantic Coast Conference championship after the departure of multi-year starter and former Final Four most outstanding player Joel Berry II.\n\nYes, this was a blowout against an overmatched team, but Woods and White both had solid games by setting up teammates for scores and avoiding turnovers.\n\n\"I'm pretty doggone pleased with our point guard position,\" UNC coach Roy Williams said. \"I'm never going to be satisfied. ... I want both of them to keep playing and getting better and better.\"\n\nWhite, a McDonald's All-American who set an in-state prep career scoring record, had 11 points and four assists with two turnovers in 20 minutes. But Woods perhaps stood out more, simply by standing out at all.\n\nHe's a gifted athlete who arrived at UNC known as a YouTube dunking sensation, but he had struggled to find a steady role while averaging just 1.4 points through his first two seasons. But he had seven points and a career-best eight assists, including the crowd-wower to Johnson for a 65-30 lead with 15:54 left.\n\nAlong the way, he looked comfortable finding teammates in transition and even hit a 3-pointer \u2014 only the third of his career and first since November 2016. More important, he had zero turnovers in his 17 minutes.\n\n\"It's definitely a confidence builder,\" Woods said. \"It's just trying to build off it in every way possible. And I realize I still have to get better on both ends of the court.\"\n\nNorth Carolina shot 55 percent on a night filled with impressive statistics, while Micaiah Henry scored 20 points to lead the Golden Eagles (0-4) \u2014 who shot 36 percent and had 22 turnovers.\n\n\"We just need to get better,\" Tennessee Tech coach Steve Payne said. \"We knew what (challenge) we had tonight. We were going to have to play our tails off and things would have to go great to have a chance late \u2014 and it didn't.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nTennessee Tech: A rough start to the season got rougher. The Golden Eagles had lost by 15 at Memphis, by 15 at home against Presbyterian and by 14 at Savannah State coming into Chapel Hill \u2014 putting them at No. 317 in KenPom's national rankings entering Friday's games. This time they fell behind by double figures by the 13:36 mark of the first half and watched the margin grow steadily.\n\n\"We just want to compete our tails off and get better,\" Payne said. \"It's hard to. We're a little down. And tonight was a little hard, but I thought we kept fighting, even to the end. ... But right now, we're just not ready. And it's my job to get them ready for it. We'll keep pushing.\"\n\nUNC: The Tar Heels are making offense look easy early. This was their second 100-point output in four games, and they scored 50 points in each half Friday despite shooting just 5 of 23 from behind the arc. Luke Maye's 15 points led six players in double figures.\n\nBLOWOUT NUMBERS\n\nThe Tar Heels used a 17-2 first-half run to blow the game open and kept stretching the lead in a transition-filled romp. They finished with 29 fast-break points \u2014 more than any game in at least three seasons \u2014 and had 30 second-chance points after dominating the glass (54-24).\n\nWILLIAMS' INJURY\n\nUNC senior Kenny Williams left the game after rolling his right ankle while landing on someone's foot while pursuing a rebound with 7:54 left.

Maryland won 80-69. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) \u2014 Maryland forward Bruno Fernando didn't start Friday night.\n\nHe had no trouble finishing in the Terrapins' 80-69 comeback victory over Hofstra.\n\nThe sophomore had 17 points and seven rebounds and made all eight of his field goal attempts for the Terrapins (4-0). It was the 12th time in school history a player was perfect from the floor with at least eight attempts and the first since Sean Mosley was 8 of 8 against Longwood in 2010.\n\nCoach Mark Turgeon said the decision not to start Fernando was \"about teaching life lessons.\" Maryland did not make Fernando available for interviews after the game. He scored 11 points while playing all 20 minutes after the break.\n\n\"The second half, he responded the right way,\" Turgeon said. \"We all did. The whole team did.\"\n\nFreshman Eric Ayala scored a career-high 14 points, while Aaron Wiggins added 13. Darryl Morsell had 12 points, and both Anthony Cowan Jr. and Jalen Smith had 11.\n\nJustin Wright-Foreman, who entered the game tied for 10th in the country with 25.3 points per game, scored 27 points for the Pride (2-2). Hofstra built a 37-31 lead the break, the first time Maryland trailed at halftime this season.\n\nHofstra extended its edge to 43-35, but Maryland responded with a 16-3 run to claim the lead for good. The Terps never led by less than three points in the final 14 minutes.\n\nMaryland had a 48-22 scoring edge in the paint, and it grabbed 16 offensive rebounds to Hofstra's 19 defensive rebounds.\n\n\"If you look on our board, one of the things was get tough rebounds, and they had 16 offensive rebounds,\" Hofstra coach Joe Mihalich said. \"It's a lot easier said than done to keep those guys off the glass. The big guy, he's a load. The other guys, they're not slouches, either.\"\n\nUltimately, it was Fernando who made the biggest difference as he continued his torrid start. He is averaging 14.5 points while shooting 82.8 percent from the floor (24 of 29).\n\n\"His presence is always insane,\" Wiggins said. \"Just the energy and the size and just what he does for our team on the inside. He's able to get easy buckets and once he gets a few buckets, teams start doubling him. So once they start doubling, he's able to kick out and get open shots, and if we're hitting shots, that's a dangerous team.\"\n\nSUPER SIX\n\nTurgeon is still trying to figure out his rotation, but tightened things considerably in the second half.

(Zack Wajsgras/The Daily Progress via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) \u2014 De'Andre Hunter wasn't the focus of Coppin State's defense on Friday night, so the sophomore forward showed the overmatched Eagles the error of their ways.\n\nHunter scored 20 points in just 15\u00bd minutes, and No. 4 Virginia opened with a 21-5 run and beat Coppin State 97-40 on Friday night.\n\nHunter made all four of his 3-point shots and seven of nine overall and was outscoring the Eagles for most of the first half after hitting two early 3-pointers for the Cavaliers (3-0). A 3-pointer by Ibn Williams with 6:10 left in the half finally gave Coppin State more points than Hunter (13-11), but the Eagles trailed 26-13 and Virginia responded with a 19-2 run over the next 5\u00bd minutes.\n\n\"Seeing the early ones go in definitely helps your confidence,\" Hunter said.\n\nMamadi Diakite started in place of Jack Salt (stiff back) for Virginia and added a career-high 18 points on 7-for-9 shooting. Ty Jerome scored 11 with six assists.\n\n\"It felt pretty good. I trusted my teammates and I was playing free,\" Diakite said. \"I was relaxed, more relaxed than the past few games.\"\n\nCoppin State coach Juan Dixon said his team focused mostly on the offense of Jerome and Kyle Guy in scouting, and paid for it.\n\nThe Cavaliers shot 60.3 percent overall (35-58) and were 15 for 25 (60 percent) from behind the arc.\n\nDiakite credited Hunter for his big night.\n\n\"It gets very easy for us because my man has to double him and he can dish balls to me and I can finish it or, if I get doubled, I can pass it,\" he said. \"He opens a lot of things for us.\"\n\nThe Cavaliers will next travel to The Bahamas to face stiffer competition in the Battle 4 Atlantis.\n\n\"Obviously the competition will step up, but really, you just play the game that's before you,\" coach Tony Bennett said. \"I really liked our activity. I like how we shared the ball tonight.\"\n\nIbn Williams and Lamar Morgan led Coppin State (0-4) with six points each. The Eagles trailed 45-17 at halftime and 63-20 after a 15-0 run by Virginia in the second half.\n\n\"You've got to play these money games, but when you do, try to get the most out of it by competing and being tough,\" Dixon said.\n\nKERSEY TIME\n\nSenior manager Grant Kersey has become a fan favorite during three lopsided home victories at home and was again against the Eagles. He checked in during wholesale changes with 3:35 to play and, with one minute left, swished a 3-pointer from just left of the key for his first career field goal, setting off a wild celebration by the crowd.\n\n\"He took that shot like he knew it was going in,\" Bennett said. \"That was great to see and that was the loudest I heard the crowd.\"\n\nKersey, allowed to dress for home games, had a steal in the opener and hit two free throws in the Cavaliers' last game, but his No. 13 jersey still hasn't arrived. He again wore a vastly oversized No. 1 jersey with \"Virginia\" on the back where other players have their last name.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nCoppin State: The Eagles have earned their 0-4 mark to start the season, playing on the road at Wisconsin, Dayton, Navy and Virginia. Dixon, in his second season, fell to 5-31 overall, but beyond a starting five that features three seniors and a graduate student, he's got a roster full of freshmen and sophomores that may fit better into the style he'd like to play.\n\nVirginia: The Cavaliers haven't experienced much resistance in beating Towson, George Washington and the Eagles to start the season. After opening against Middle Tennessee in the Battle 4 Atlantis, they will play either Butler or Dayton in the second round.\n\n\"It will be a lot different because we won't have a home crowd there, but we still have to play our game and do what we do,\" Hunter said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCoppin State: The Eagles stay on the road, playing at Rider in New Jersey on Monday.\n\nVirginia: Ventures away from home for the first time, facing Middle Tennessee in The Bahamas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Saudi officials, however, denied that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved or aware of the killing.\n\nThe CIA reached its conclusions on intelligence, including phone calls between the crown prince's brother, Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, and Khashoggi, the Washington Post reported, citing unnamed officials.\n\nThe Post reported the CIA had evidence showing Khalid told Khashoggi he should visit the Saudi's consulate in Istanbul, the location where Khashoggi was killed and dismembered.\n\nKhalid denied having any recent communications with Khashoggi, saying in a statement from an Embassy spokesperson that the last time he'd communicated with the columnist was in October of 2017.\n\nUnfortunately the @washingtonpost did not print our full response.

Trump has repeatedly said he worried about harming an arms deal with the regime, which he said would generate jobs in the U.S.\n\nSince Khashoggi disappeared in October, the Saudi government offered a wide array of explanations. First, saying they had no idea what happened to him, then explaining he was killed in a scuffle during an interrogation gone wrong.\n\nBut the explanation continues to change. On Thursday, a Saudi prosecutor examining the case said Khashoggi's death was planned out by a team of 15 Saudi officials and he was injected with a drug that led to an overdose.\n\nThe Saudi government blames a rouge group of officials for the killing and has attempted to distance the royal family from Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nMore: The conflicting statements given by Saudi Arabia about journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nMore: Trump on Saudi handling of Khashoggi death: \u2018Worst cover-up ever\u2019\n\nCLOSE Jamal Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, had messages for President Donald Trump and America in a video shown at his memorial service in Washington.

His younger brother Kyle (2015 champion), defending champion Martin Truex Jr., Kevin Harvick (2014 champion) and Joey Logano will compete for the title on Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not productive for anybody, and I think that if Kurt could go back and do that over again, he probably wouldn\u2019t have said those things,\u201d Dale Earnhardt Jr., NASCAR\u2019s 15-time most popular driver turned NBC broadcaster, said on a conference call with reporters this week. \u201cWhen you feel like you\u2019ve been wronged by NASCAR, you come over the radio and say something that you try to take a dig at them, but you forget that everyone else is listening.\u201d\n\nKurt Busch said what he did out of anger and apologized after the race, but his venting had some kernels of truth, even if the series' ever-changing rules are only one factor.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the most pressing issues for NASCAR heading into its relatively short offseason:\n\nTV numbers remain in decline\n\nThe talk of sports TV ratings has centered around the NFL in recent seasons, a slide that pundits have liked to attribute to player protests initiated to draw attention to social justice issues. No sport, however, wraps itself around the red, white and blue, the military and God like NASCAR where before each race there\u2019s a prayer and the national anthem \u2014 followed by a perfectly timed flyover by a branch of the armed forces.\n\nNASCAR\u2019s declines for its Cup broadcasts on Fox and NBC have been precipitous, according to information provided to USA TODAY Sports by Nielsen. Heading into this weekend\u2019s finale, viewership (3.16 million) is down more than 20% compared to the same point last year and has fallen 62.6% from the sport\u2019s all-time high in 2005.\n\nWhat\u2019s being done: Ratings were on the decline when NBC and Fox entered into a 10-year $4.4 billion deal in 2013, one that came before the retirements of Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Carl Edwards and Earnhardt Jr.\n\n\"It's been a great back-and-forth dialogue,\" Sam Flood, NBC Sports executive producer and president of production, told USA TODAY Sports. \"I love the openness from the leadership of NASCAR. We are all 100% all-in at making NASCAR great and we are going to get there.\"\n\nBefore the NFL season started, Flood pointed out that NASCAR broadcasts on NBCSN were the most-watched sports cable draws for seven weekends.\n\n\"A lot of sports would be thrilled to have that,\" Flood said.\n\nMORE NASCAR:\n\nSponsors and costs\n\nJimmie Johnson\u2019s No. 48 Hendrick Motorsport Chevrolet will carry Lowe\u2019s as its title sponsor for the final time on Sunday. Lowe\u2019s had been with Johnson since he debuted in 2001 and got plenty of exposure as Johnson won seven titles for the home improvement giant.\n\nTruex\u2019s team, Furniture Row Racing, will close one year after he won the championship and even as he competes for another. The move came after the Denver-based team lost 5-Hour Energy as a co-primary sponsor.\n\nThat follows other companies like Target, Subway and Home Depot leaving the sport in recent years. Monster Energy will return for one more season in 2019 as the Cup title sponsor before the series moves to a tiered format, where multiple companies not willing to pay what Monster does annually ($20 million) could be brought into the fold.\n\n\"I think a lot of sports are going through a time where there's trouble and they've got to work hard,\" team owner and Hall of Fame NFL coach Joe Gibbs said. \"I think we're certainly working hard, and I know from (interim NASCAR Chairman and CEO) Jim France on down, for us, to be quite truthful, it's exciting. And it's kind of exciting where we are.\"\n\nJim France has led NASCAR since Brian France's arrest in August on driving while intoxicated and drug possession in August.\n\nWhat\u2019s being done: There\u2019s been talk about some type of spending cap for teams, although the implementation of such would be unwieldy. The NFL, NBA and NHL have salary caps to keep player contracts in check, but NASCAR teams pay drivers, pit crew members, mechanics back in the shop, transportation costs of getting cars to the track along with the cars themselves.\n\nNASCAR points to the additions of Ally Bank (replacing Lowe's on Johnson's car) and John Deere (primary sponsor for Roush Fenway Racing's Ricky Stenhouse Jr.) as evidence of the value the sport. NASCAR says nearly half the Fortune 100 companies still have sponsorship deals, either with teams or NASCAR itself.\n\nRaces too long and too many?\n\nThe NASCAR Cup season is 36 races \u2014 not counting exhibitions \u2014 and runs from the season-opening Daytona 500 in February through mid November. It\u2019s been that way since 2001 when two races were added to the schedule.\n\nMost races surpass three hours in length, leaving plenty of time for fans to critique the quality of racing that doesn\u2019t have enough passing for some.\n\nWhat\u2019s being done: NASCAR announced earlier this month its plan to acquire International Speedway Corporation (ISC). Both companies are run by the France family and were founded by Bill France Sr.\n\nIf the merger is completed, NASCAR could more easily cut down the schedule. ISC currently hosts 19 of 36 Cup events with Daytona, Martinsville, Talladega, Richmond, Michigan and Phoenix having multiple dates. There likely won't be many changes until after the 2020 season when the agreements with the current tracks conclude.\n\nFollow Perez on Twitter @byajperez"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Paradise man escapes Camp Fire with classic car", "description": "Daniel Cayer saved his 1929 Ford Roadster from the Camp Fire by hitching it to his 1963 Chevy pickup and racing it out of danger.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2018/11/17/paradise-man-escapes-camp-fire-classic-car/2031385002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/636779924578023695-Paradise-man-escapes-Camp-Fire-with-classic-car.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T00:21:27Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Kyle Busch leads title contenders in qualifying for finale", "description": "Kyle Busch will lead NASCAR's title contenders at the start of Sunday's championship finale", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2018/11/16/kyle-busch-leads-title-contenders-in-qualifying-for-finale/38547607/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/815d0aadb5311d0c9860b52b66e54b642110bf20/c=0-290-4806-2993/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/usatsports/8cddf26bb3d744978b01ae65dd96e237.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T00:18:10Z", "content": "Joey Logano stands in the garage during practice for the NASCAR Cup auto race at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Friday, Nov. 16, 2018, in Homestead, Fla.

Then he was bumped by teammate Denny Hamlin and the politics began.\n\nHamlin gets the first pick of pit stalls for winning the pole, but Busch wants that spot. Busch is one of four drivers racing Sunday for the championship and Hamlin is not one of them.\n\n\"It's a discussion,\" Hamlin said about the strategy the Joe Gibbs Racing camp will use. \"I mean, my pit crew is a second slower than Kyle's. Everything is earned, nothing is given. We'll have the discussion.\"\n\nReigning series champion Martin Truex Jr. was in a similar position last year and asked Hamlin, a fellow Toyota driver, to give him the first pit stall but Hamlin declined. Busch didn't think his luck would be any better.\n\n\"That's probably too far, but it would sure be nice,\" Busch said.\n\nHamlin turned a lap at 173.863 mph in the closing seconds of Friday qualifying to bump Busch from the top starting spot. Busch thought his lap at 173.622 was enough for the pole, but it only put him ahead of the other three title contenders.\n\nTruex qualified third to put three Toyotas at the front of the field. It's his final race with Furniture Row Racing because a loss of sponsorship is forcing the team to close following the finale.\n\nJoey Logano qualified fifth for Team Penske. Kevin Harvick was 12th, lowest of the title contenders, but not overly concerned about where he's starting.\n\n\"I mean, we qualified 12th, not last,\" Harvick said. \"I think it's not that big a deal if we can get our car driving right for Sunday.\"\n\nLogano also cautioned against making predictions off of the qualifying results.\n\n\"I don't think a whole bunch transfers over. I think everyone was just tuned in for one (qualifying) lap,\" Logano said.\n\nHamlin, meanwhile, won the pole for the second consecutive year and in a meaningful race for his team. He announced earlier Friday that he and crew chief Mike Wheeler are parting ways at the end of this season and Hamlin seemed emotional about the split.\n\nHe and Wheeler won their very first race together, the Daytona 500 in 2016, and Hamlin wants to bookend their time together with a victory in their finale. A win would also extend Hamlin's streak of winning at least one race every season since his 2006 debut.\n\nHamlin had to win at Homestead in 2013 to keep his streak active.\n\n\"We definitely want to end on a high note and try to win, in 2013 we were in the same predicament where we hadn't won a race until the final race and we got it done, so hopefully it's our time to do it,\" Hamlin said. \"We're going to keep digging. Hats off to this team.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Mississippi State's season hasn't gone exactly as planned with the Bulldogs well out of the Southeastern Conference Western Division race.\n\nThere are some obvious reasons for the team's losses, but it's hard to put any blame on the defense.\n\nMississippi State has played some of the best defense in the nation this fall and the group will be remembered among the best in school history. No. 25 Mississippi State (6-4, 2-4 Southeastern Conference) will lean on that side of the ball once again when it hosts Arkansas (2-8, 0-6) on Saturday.\n\nCount Arkansas coach Chad Morris among those who's been impressed by the Bulldogs.\n\n\"The defense is as good as advertised,\" Morris said. \"It's the fastest overall defense that we've seen. Extremely aggressive, very pressure oriented.\"\n\nMississippi State is giving up just 13.5 points per game this season, which ranks 2nd in the SEC behind Alabama. The Bulldogs are giving up 281.3 yards per game, which leads the league. Defensive end Montez Sweat is second in the league with 9\u00bd sacks this season and Jeffery Simmons has 11\u00bd tackles for loss.\n\nThey'll go against an Arkansas team that's struggled, but has improved in recent weeks. The Razorbacks have lost two of their past three SEC games by a touchdown or less, including last weekend's 24-17 loss to then-No. 9 LSU.\n\nMississippi State coach Joe Moorhead said the Bulldogs still have plenty to play for, even if an SEC title is out of reach. He said the team always has a range of goals: The top end is winning an SEC championship and playing for a national title while the bottom end is winning six games and qualifying for a bowl game.\n\n\"So, right now, we obviously didn't achieve the former, we have already achieved the latter and the last two games will determine if we are able to get to nine wins or get to a good bowl game,\" Moorhead said.\n\nHere are some other things to watch when the Bulldogs host the Razorbacks:\n\nWILLIE GAY JR. BREAKS OUT\n\nMississippi State's defense already has plenty of playmakers, but added another one during last weekend's 24-0 loss to No. 1 Alabama. Sophomore linebacker Willie Gay Jr., who was starting for a sick Leo Lewis, had the best game of his career with nine tackles, two sacks and an interception. He'll likely have another big role on Saturday.\n\nSENIOR DAY\n\nIt will be the final home game for 20 seniors when the Bulldogs host the Razorbacks. Among the players honored will be quarterback Nick Fitzgerald, who has had one of the most unique careers for a QB in SEC history. The 6-foot-5, 230-pounder has been an inconsistent passer during his three years, but his 3,302 career yards rushing are the most for a QB in SEC history.\n\nADVANTAGE STATE\n\nArkansas has a 16-11-1 record in the series against Mississippi State, but the Bulldogs have dominated in recent seasons. Mississippi State has won five of six in the series dating back to 2012, including last season's 28-21 victory in Fayetteville. Fitzgerald threw for two touchdowns in the final four minutes to lead the Bulldogs to the come-from-behind win.\n\nWATCH FOR O'GRADY\n\nJunior TE Cheyenne O'Grady had a big game for the Razorbacks against LSU, catching six passes for 75 yards and two touchdowns. He's caught a career-high 27 passes this season, which leads the team.\n\nPRODUCTIVE HARRIS\n\nArkansas linebacker De'Jon Harris has 105 tackles this season, which leads the SEC and ranks 17th nationally. He also has nine tackles for a loss and five pass breakups this season.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Christian Palma, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) \u2014 This was a respite for the Los Angeles Rams but certainly no vacation.\n\nThe team kept its plans to train at the Air Force Academy and stay at the posh Broadmoor Hotel in the Rocky Mountain foothills even after the NFL moved their Monday night showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs to the Los Angeles Coliseum because of a frayed football field at Mexico City's Azteca Stadium.\n\nThe primary benefit shifted from altitude acclimation to getting away from the wildfires back home and doing some midseason team bonding.\n\n\"It's been a little bit wild for sure, but with that being said, there's a lot more people dealing with a lot worse than what we're dealing with right now,\" quarterback Jared Goff said. \"We're the lucky ones and we're having a good time out here in Colorado.\"\n\nThe deadly wildfires that are surrounding the Rams' training complex back home affected some players and coaches directly and some indirectly.\n\n\"I personally wasn't affected, but I look at my teammates as family,\" Ndamukong Suh said. \"So, we all have to deal with it in some form or fashion.\"\n\nThe trip to Colorado also allowed the Rams (9-1) to do some midseason bonding, something tight end Rob Gronkowski said helped the Patriots refocus down the stretch last season after they spent a week at the academy ahead of their game against the Raiders in Mexico City.\n\nRams coach Sean McVay said he reached out to Patriots coach Bill Belichick for some tips about how they handled the week away in the Rocky Mountains.\n\n\"Anybody like a Bill Belichick, if they're able to give you a perspective, it'd be silly not to listen and try to apply it,\" McVay said.\n\nThe Rams will fly home Saturday after what was actually a business trip.\n\n\"The Broadmoor's great. I haven't played any golf,\" defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said. \"I've got a lot of friends here, but I haven't really seen anybody because we've been working. It's a work trip ... we're getting ready to play a game.\"\n\nMcVay said training in Colorado won't be a waste even though the game now will be played at sea level.\n\n\"With all the things going on right now, I think there's some guys that, at the time, wouldn't have been able to get back into their houses,\" McVay said. \"There's a lot of things that we were doing here. One of them was, obviously, to get ready for playing in the elevation and different things like that. It does still serve you well to train in these environments.\n\n\"So, it'll help us out. Then really, we looked at it as another chance to kind of get away before the bye week, continue to connect as a team where there's not any real distractions.\"\n\nThat bonding may be the ultimate benefit of their brief trip.\n\n\"If anything, the last week has really made you appreciate the perspective that this gives you,\" McVay said. \"What's so special about football is the brotherhood that you share with the teammates, the coaches, the rapport and just the camaraderie. There's nothing like it.\n\n\"To be able to go through some of these things, to also know that when you're going through real life adversity outside of football, that you have a support system, you have people that care about you unconditionally \u2014 that's what's real.\"\n\nMcVay said he took in the picturesque mountains, the fresh air and the amenities of the Broadmoor, but \"I really haven't had a chance to get out and explore. We're in the midst of game planning and things like that, but I know our players have enjoyed it.\n\n\"They got a chance to go to the Nuggets-Rockets game the other night. I think it's been a great getaway for the team to be together and kind of bond.\"\n\nNotes: WR Cooper Kupp underwent knee surgery this week. \"It went really well,\" McVay said. \"He called right afterward and he was in great spirits and I know if anybody's going to attack the rehab process the right way it's going to be Cooper Kupp.\"\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Pro Football Writer Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: GEORGE ANDREASSI/TCPALM)\n\nAs Florida's statewide hand recount rumbles on, Sen. Bill Nelson's chances of winning re-election are growing increasingly dim.\n\nA couple of court losses late Thursday and \u2013 perhaps most damaging \u2013 Friday's hand recount in Democrat stronghold Broward County that did not appear to give Nelson the lift he needed.\n\nThen came word late Friday afternoon that the vast majority of the ballots in the hand recount across the state are unlikely to help Nelson because voters chose to skip the Senate race altogether. That recount was considered a linchpin of Nelson's already uphill strategy to victory.\n\nMost experts say Nelson now needs a miracle to erase Republican challenger Rick Scott's 12,603-vote lead, formalized after Thursday's machine recount ended. A hand recount of disputed ballots that were set aside because the machines had trouble counting them is now being conducted.\n\n\"He can pull this off but everything has to go his way,\" said Charles Zelden, a political science professor and election recount expert at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. \"And any one small glitch can be enough to keep him from winning.\"\n\nAt this point, Nelson has until Sunday at noon to pull off his long-shot bid. Barring a court ruling, that's the deadline for canvassing boards at each of Florida's 67 counties to report their final recount tallies to the state.\n\nMarc Elias, Nelson's lead recount attorney, admitted to reporters late Thursday that a lot of factors have to break the senator's way for victory. But he also was confident they would, given that Scott's initial lead on the night of Election Day shrank from about 60,000 votes (out of nearly 8.2 million cast) to fewer than 13,000.\n\n\"It's never been our view that there was going to be one silver bullet that was going to change the margin in the race,\" Elias said. \"If you look at each stage where the margin has shrunk, it has not shrunk because of one big thing, but rather it has shrunk from a number of smaller things. As we move forward I continue to expect that (12,603) margin to go down and disappear entirely.\"\n\nHere's a look at some of the obstacles facing Nelson:\n\nThe hand recount is not going his way\n\nThere are about 65,000 questionable ballots statewide to examine in the hand recount, according to the Florida Secretary of State's office. Nelson would have to win about 60 percent of those votes to take the lead.\n\nThe recount is examining ballots with \"overvotes\" (where the machine did not tabulate it because both candidates were chosen) and \"undervotes\" (where the machine did not tabulate it because no one was chosen).\n\nA human review of an overvote ballot could show if the voter intended to pick one candidate over the other. The belief was that could help Nelson because the county overwhelmingly voted for him against Scott, who is Florida's governor, and those disputed ballots would break the same way.\n\nCLOSE Florida's battle for the U.S. Senate is headed to a legally required hand recount (Nov. 15) AP\n\nThe recount in Broward was finished after just two hours Friday. Election officials didn't immediately release results, but the speed with which the recount was conducted suggests most of the ballots were undercounts. That doesn't help Nelson because those are votes that won't be counted.\n\nIn fact, the news got even worse for Nelson. Of the roughly 65,000 votes being reviewed, 62,257 \u2013 or about 95 percent \u2013 were undervotes. With fewer than 3,000 votes up for grabs, Nelson will have to find \"silver bullets\" in other places to scrounge up the difference.\n\nCourts offer little remedy\n\nNelson will need the courts to side with him in his effort to give counties more ballots to count and more time to tabulate them.\n\nThe senator gained one court victory earlier this week when U.S. Chief Judge Mark Walker ordered Secretary of State Ken Detzner to give voters whose ballots were tossed because their signatures didn\u2019t match what was on file until 5 p.m. Saturday to \"cure\" their ballots. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Nelson after a GOP appeal.\n\nBut the judge denied a request by Nelson to extend Thursday's 3 p.m. machine recount deadline. Palm Beach County was unable to finish in time. So now Nelson is seeking a hand recount of each of the nearly 585,000 ballots in the county \u2013 a process that likely would take weeks.\n\nWalker also denied a request to give election monitors more flexibility in divining voter intent during the hand recount. And he threw out a motion by the Florida League of Women Voters to have Scott recuse himself from the recount process and step down as governor.\n\nElection workers place ballots into electronic counting machines at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, Florida. (Photo: Joe Cavaretta, AP)\n\nStill pending was Walker's motion on a lawsuit from VoteVets demanding that domestic vote-by-mail ballots, which must be received by the day of the election, be treated the same as overseas ballots, which can be received as late as 10 days after the election.\n\n\u201cCitizens in the U.S. should be given the same opportunity as expatriates living abroad,\u201d Elias said.\n\nTime running out\n\nNelson has less than a week to pull off a win. Or at least buy more time.\n\nCounties have until noon Sunday to finish their hand recounts on the Senate race. Then on Tuesday, the state Elections Canvassing Commission, consisting of the governor (who has recused himself) and two cabinet members, meets to certify the Nov. 6 election official returns.\n\nThere\u2019s also a Nov. 30 deadline for any candidate, voter or taxpayer to contest election results in circuit court.\n\nZelden, the election expert, likened Nelson's chances to a player in a card game betting all his chips on a specific card being pulled from the deck.\n\n\"He's literally depending on it to be the queen of hearts,\" Zelden said. \"Anything else, he loses. Sometimes it shows up, but the odds are pretty good it's not going to.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/16/florida-recount-bill-nelsons-chances-beating-rick-scott-slim/2027236002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Aretha Franklin's 'Amazing Grace' film hits theaters", "description": "More than 40 years after it was filmed, a documentary detailing the making of Aretha Franklin's groundbreaking and best-selling album \"Amazing Grace\" has been released.
