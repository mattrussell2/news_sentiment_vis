Nassar molestation scandal shook the sport to its core, according to court documents filed Wednesday in a California federal court.\n\nKathy Scanlan, the president of U.S.A. Gymnastics from 1994 to 1998, said in a sworn statement last month that she had notified the U.S.O.C. of the sexual abuse problem soon after she took charge of the organization. The U.S.O.C.\u2019s response, she said, was to discourage her from using the federation\u2019s established protocol for investigating and disciplining its professional members who were accused of sexual abuse. She said that she had gone ahead and pursued cases the accused anyway.\n\n\u201cU.S.O.C.\u2019s challenge to U.S.A.G. disciplining professional members in this fashion (specifically impeding the ability to ban, suspend or investigate a member) would have inhibited me from adequately protecting minor members,\u201d Scanlan said in her statement, which was part of hundreds of pages of documents filed Wednesday in a lawsuit that Aly Raisman, the two-time Olympian, has filed. Raisman is suing Nassar, who was the national team doctor; the U.S.O.C.; U.S.A. Gymnastics; and other defendants.\n\nScanlan\u2019s testimony highlighted the fact that the federation and the U.S.O.C. had battled for years over how to handle sexual abuse cases. That conflict appears to have lasted until at least 1999, when Scanlan\u2019s successor, Bob Colarossi, confronted the U.S.O.C. in a letter that was unsealed in 2017 as part of another sex abuse case in the sport."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "Zach Wichter", "title": "Good Cheap Flights Still Exist.

The deal was worth upward of $80 billion, depending on how many plants Saudi Arabia decided to build.\n\nBut there is a hitch: Saudi Arabia insists on producing its own nuclear fuel, even though it could buy it more cheaply abroad, according to American and Saudi officials familiar with the negotiations. That raised concerns in Washington that the Saudis could divert their fuel into a covert weapons project \u2014 exactly what the United States and its allies feared Iran was doing before it reached the 2015 nuclear accord, which President Trump has since abandoned.\n\nPrince Mohammed set off alarms when he declared earlier this year, in the midst of the negotiation, that if Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s fiercest rival, \u201cdeveloped a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.\u201d His negotiators stirred more worries by telling the Trump administration that Saudi Arabia would refuse to sign an agreement that would allow United Nations inspectors to look anywhere in the country for signs that the Saudis might be working on a bomb, American officials said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "BEN KENIGSBERG", "title": "5 Film Series to Catch in N.Y.C.

Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As the New-York Historical Society\u2019s exhibition \u201cBetye Saar: Keepin\u2019 It Clean\u201d demonstrates, the institutional oversight is especially baffling, as her primary themes \u2014 racial justice and feminism \u2014 are exactly attuned to the present moment and, indeed, to every American moment within memory.\n\nMs. Saar grew up in the Watts section of Los Angeles, watching the immigrant Italian artist Simon Rodia construct his fabulous towers from scrap materials. An encounter with Joseph Cornell\u2019s art in the early 1960s convinced her that assemblage could be intimately scaled and politically pointed. By then, she was already involved in the Black Arts and women\u2019s movements. Her 1972 breakthrough piece, \u201cThe Liberation of Aunt Jemima,\u201d merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter.\n\nIn the show at the New-York Historical Society, which comes from the Craft & Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, the same figure appears, though the main transformed element is different: the old- fashioned wooden washboard, once a domestic staple and now an antique artifact. Generations of women, among them servants, used it to keep things clean , though without being able to erase the stains of racism and sexism from their lives.

It\u2019s strewn on fabric awnings and etched in frosted glass. It gleams in bright magenta or platinum lighting. It\u2019s used for beauty salons, Mexican restaurants, laundromats, bagel shops, numerous sushi bars. It may be distorted, stacked vertically, or shoehorned into a cluster of other typefaces. But even here Choc remains clear and articulate, its voice deep and friendly, its accent foreign, perhaps, yet endearing.\n\nYou\u2019ve already seen it, probably repeatedly, like a stranger you recognize from your morning commute.\n\nSumo Teriyaki and Sushi at 139 Havemeyer Street in Brooklyn. Vincent Tullo for The New York Times\n\nFrance, 1955\n\nLike so many New Yorkers, Choc is an immigrant.\n\nChoc specimen, cover, 1955 Advertisement for the Choc typeface, in La France graphique, No 107, Nov. 1955\n\nIt was designed by Roger Excoffon, a French typographer and graphic designer whose work departed from the Modernist trends that characterized midcentury type design. Based in Marseilles, Excoffon created a diverse array of typefaces during the 1940s and \u201950s, but his script typefaces have become his most enduring work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an unmistakable energy in all the designs that he does,\u201d said Tobias Frere-Jones, a Brooklyn-based typeface designer. \u201cThey project their personality so clearly. And it\u2019s very obviously not Helvetica or not Times or any other generic thing that might be on the awning next door.\u201d\n\nExcoffon\u2019s most popular typeface is probably Mistral, which was modeled after his own handwriting. (Mistral has been widely used for years, from the title credits in \u201cNight Court\u201d to Connecticut Muffin or N.W.A.\u2019s logos, not to mention many storefronts in New York and elsewhere.) There\u2019s also Banco, which can justly be described as \u201cshouty,\u201d composed entirely of letters that resemble exclamation marks; Calypso, with halftone-patterned letterforms that look like miniature optical illusions; Diane, an ornate script that\u2019s just about impossible to use outside of wedding invitations; and there is Choc, something of a synthesis of all of these.\n\nAmy\u2019s Restaurant at 586 West 207th Street in Manhattan.

Notice how often the \u201cd\u201d and \u201cb\u201d can be rotated to make a \u201cp\u201d or a \u201cq,\u201d or how a capital \u201cZ\u201d is so plainly a grown-up version of its lowercase counterpart. But Choc is full of irregularity. Its lowercase \u201cr\u201d resembles a \u201cz.\u201d Its \u201cg\u201d looks like a capital \u201cS.\u201d And its \u201ch\u201d crouches forward as though in starting position for a race, whereas its more heavyset uppercase incarnation is on the verge of rolling backward.\n\n\u201cChoc expresses a certain violence,\u201d said Sandra Chamaret, a French designer and publisher, and a co-author of a 2010 monograph on Excoffon. \u201cIt seems spattered on the page, the letters going in all directions.\u201d (\u201cChoc\u201d \u2014 the \u2018ch\u2019 is soft, as in \u2018sh\u2019 \u2014 is French for \u201cshock\u201d or \u201ccrash.\u201d)\n\nChoc remains distinctive for these reasons, and it lacks datedness, as evidenced in its continued use throughout the world, most visibly on storefronts.\n\nTulcingo at 5520 5th Avenue in Brooklyn. Vincent Tullo for The New York Times\n\nA Sign Painter\u2019s Heaven\n\nChoc wouldn\u2019t appear on storefronts until well after its 1955 conception, however.\n\nAs an industry, type design was at this time slow-going, and its applications more limited than it is now. It wasn\u2019t until the spread of phototypesetting in the 1960s that Choc could be used efficiently for large-scale applications. Before then, the most practical way to get your name on your business was to have it painted by hand.\n\n\u201cNew York was just a sign painter\u2019s heaven until designers started getting involved,\u201d Mr. Heller said. \u201cThere were one or two or three sign producers that did all the signs, and they worked from a fairly consistent stylebook, like going into a stationery store and looking for a wedding sample.\u201d\n\nHana Sushi at 211 7th Avenue in Manhattan.

Vincent Tullo for The New York Times\n\nPaul Boegemann was trained as one such sign painter \u2014 he is the proprietor of Paul Signs Inc., in Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn \u2014 and has been in business for over 35 years.\n\n\u201cI learned how to hand letter signs and trucks,\u201d Mr. Boegemann said. \u201cWe started with a simple pencil and paper. We designed what we wanted and used the styles we wanted and knew how to apply.\u201d\n\nRight around the time Mr. Boegemann got into the business, the first computerized vinyl printing machines became efficient alternatives to hand-lettered signage. One was the Gerber IVB, also known as the Signmaker.\n\n\u201cI bought the second Signmaker in N.Y.C. back in 1984, $10,000 with three fonts and 10 colors of vinyl,\u201d Mr. Boegeman said. \u201cThe computer makes everything faster and cheaper.\n\n\u201cOver the years, more computer-generated advances made more fonts and designs and sizes,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone got into the sign and printing industry. You did not have to have any talent or skills.\u201d\n\nAsked if he\u2019s ever made a sign in Choc, Mr. Boegemann said: \u201cThis style is a \u2018Bastard\u2019 letter style.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate these styles and do not consider them as sign advertising. It is all graffiti.\u201d\n\nSakura 6 at 837 Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn. Vincent Tullo for The New York Times\n\nHow Did Choc Get Here?\n\nAnd yet, Choc is everywhere. But the reasons for its prevalence are something of a mystery.\n\nThere\u2019s an abundance of Arial (Spin City Cleaners in the East Village), as well as more kitschy options like Brush Script (Economy Candy in the Lower East Side) or Impact (5th Ave. Gourmet Delight, on a corner in Park Slope). These typefaces have long been available in computer operating systems, which would account in part for their proliferation.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t precisely the case with Choc. In the early 1990s it was packaged with CorelDraw, a vector graphics editor, but under a different name: Staccato 555. CorelDraw, according to Mr. Frere-Jones, \u201cwould have been more common at a sign-making shop, being cheaper and Windows-based.\u201d\n\nAt any rate, Choc is more common than its limited availability may indicate. It\u2019s used consistently as well, and with evident purpose.\n\nThis could have to do with what Choc evokes. For some it bears a resemblance to the calligraphic forms of Asian writing systems.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s disputed as to whether Choc was a direct homage to these styles. According to Ms. Chamaret, Jos\u00e9 Mendoza, Excoffon\u2019s assistant at the time of Choc\u2019s production, said that the letterforms were drawn in outlines. \u201cNever with a brush!\u201d she said.\n\nEven so, and just as pizzerias favor color schemes that recall the Italian flag, or how the names of Irish pubs rely on Gaelic-looking letters, Choc has come to signify Asia.\n\nJohn Chen, a New York-based restaurateur, claims to be among the first to have used Choc on signs in New York. (The front of Mr. Chen\u2019s 25-year-old J.J. Garden, a Chinese restaurant in Jackson Heights, is emblazoned in Choc.) \u201cWhen I wanted to use these letters, everyone thought I was crazy,\u201d he said, speaking in Mandarin.\n\nAji Sushi at 201 5th Avenue in Brooklyn.

Vincent Tullo for The New York Times\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s abstract. It\u2019s modern. It\u2019s artistic,\u201d Mr. Chen continued. \u201cIt just gives you that certain feeling.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Choc has become a typographical shorthand for Asian-themed restaurants. Imagine a sushi bar adorned in Helvetica, and it may not seem as authentic, or as appetizing.\n\n\u201cHaving been used for a particular purpose,\u201d said Mr. Frere-Jones, referring to the contemporary applications of Excoffon\u2019s typefaces, \u201cit starts to take on a bit of that association, which encourages that association to be repeated, which just makes it stronger.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true. Excoffon\u2019s expressive, 60-year-old heavyweight script endures throughout all five boroughs: Ginger Root, on the Upper East Side; Sushi Q, in the Bronx; Sakura 6, in Greenpoint (and Natural Cleaners right across the street); Amy\u2019s Restaurant, in Inwood; Sumo Teriyaki & Sushi, in Williamsburg (which is set in an excess of Choc); A Sushi in Forest Hills; Genki Sushi in Staten Island; and, in the heart of Chinatown, Deluxe Food Market.\n\nHere and in countless other instances Choc can be a welcome familiarity. Consider Kami Asian, on Flatbush Avenue near Grand Army Plaza. It\u2019s nestled between a laundromat and a Mexican restaurant, and it\u2019s the more striking of the three storefronts: on one side is the Mexican restaurant\u2019s folksy aesthetic (its name is ornamented with a sombrero), and on the other the laundromat\u2019s staid sans-serif. In between is \u201cKami,\u201d set in gracefully spaced Choc capitals, which at night cast an ethereal glow."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "SABRINA TAVERNISE", "title": "Why the Announcement of a Looming White Minority Makes Demographers Nervous", "description": "\u201cPeople went crazy,\u201d said Dowell Myers, a demographer at the University of Southern California, of the 2008 projection that non-Hispanic whites would drop below half the population by 2042.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/us/white-americans-minority-population.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/us/00whiteminority-01/00whiteminority-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T18:14:19Z", "content": "I wish we didnt have to ask, she said.

So who counts as white has changed over time. In the 1910s and 1920s, the last time immigrants were such a large share of the American population, there were furious arguments over how to categorize newcomers from Europe.\n\nBut eventually, the immigrants from eastern and southern Europe came to be considered white.\n\nThat is because race is about power, not biology, said Charles King, a political science professor at Georgetown University.\n\n\u201cThe closer you get to social power, the closer you get to whiteness,\u201d said Dr. King, author of a coming book on Franz Boas, the early 20th-century anthropologist who argued against theories of racial difference. The one group that was never allowed to cross the line into whiteness was African-Americans, he said \u2014 the long-term legacy of slavery.\n\nTo Richard Alba, a sociologist at the City University of New York, the Census Bureau\u2019s projections seemed stuck in an outdated classification system. The bureau assigns a nonwhite label to most people who are reported as having both white and minority ancestry, he said. He likened this to the one-drop rule, a 19th-century system of racial classification in which having even one African ancestor meant you were black.\n\n\u201cThe census data is distorting the on-the-ground realities of ethnicity and race,\u201d Dr. Alba said. \u201cThere might never be a majority-minority society; it\u2019s unclear.\u201d\n\nAsked for a response to Dr. Alba\u2019s critique, a Census Bureau spokesman said in an email that \u201cwe constantly consult with stakeholders, and scholars, including Richard Alba and other federal agencies to improve our techniques, methodologies, and testing of population projections.\u201d\n\nWilliam Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, argued that the Census Bureau was doing the best that it could at a time when society was changing quickly. He was skeptical that today\u2019s Asians and Hispanics were analogous to the white ethnic Americans of the 20th century, and believed that a less conservative count would not do much to change the bigger picture. Besides, it is not the job of academics to protect people from demographic change, he said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "MICHAEL CORKERY", "title": "The F.A.O.

The Bahamian pirates were unlike most other pirates who\u2019ve come before or since in that they claimed to be engaged in more than simple banditry. Most, including Blackbeard, were former merchant and naval sailors who thought themselves engaged in a social revolt against shipowners and captains who\u2019d made their lives miserable. The pirate Sam Bellamy\u2019s crew referred to themselves as Robin Hood\u2019s men. \u201cThey vilify us, the scoundrels do, when there is only this difference,\u201d Bellamy told a captive. \u201cThey rob the poor under the cover of law\u201d and \u201cwe plunder the rich under the cover of our own courage.\u201d\n\nThere was also a democratic spirit aboard the pirates\u2019 ships six decades before Lexington and Yorktown, more than seven ahead of the storming of the Bastille. Upon seizing a vessel, the pirates turned its government upside down. Instead of using whips and beatings to enforce a rigid, top-down hierarchy, they elected and deposed their captains by popular vote. They shared their treasure almost equally and on most ships didn\u2019t allow the captain his own cabin. The contracts some crews drew up and signed included disability benefits: payments for lost eyes and limbs taken from the shared plunder before it was divvied up.\n\nAll this \u2014 and far better food, drink and hours \u2014 made piracy extremely attractive to merchant and naval sailors alike, who in this time period faced malnourishment, wage cheating, and brutal and sometimes sadistic officers. Typically when the pirates captured a ship, a portion of its crew would enthusiastically join their ranks, allowing the outbreak to expand from a handful of pirates in sloops to several thousand in multi-ship squadrons in just three years. Even the Royal Navy was vulnerable; when the ship H.M.S. Phoenix confronted the pirates at their Nassau lair 300 years ago this spring, a number of the frigate\u2019s sailors sneaked off in the night to serve under the black flag.\n\nRunaway slaves also joined the pirates as word spread that they allowed people of African descent to participate as equal members of their crews and sometimes as captains. At the height of the outbreak, it was not unusual for escaped or liberated slaves to account for a quarter or more of the pirates\u2019 crews. In the months after Blackbeard captured his flagship, Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge, witnesses would report as many as 70 serving aboard, and several remained in his closest circle to the day he died. Although pirates also treated many of the slaves they found on captured slave ships as cargo to be sold, not colleagues to recruit, their integrated ships still represented a threat to the slave colonies surrounding the Bahamas. Gov. Benjamin Bennett of Bermuda warned that slaves had \u201cgrown so impudent and insulting of late that we have reason to suspect their rising\u201d against us and \u201cfear their joining with the pirates.\u201d\n\nNot all pirates were downtrodden. Bellamy\u2019s sidekick Paulsgrave Williams was the son of Rhode Island\u2019s attorney general, and the \u201cgentleman pirate\u201d Stede Bonnet was the scion of an influential Barbados family.

Well, yes \u2014 and to be clear, in making that claim, I\u2019m not suggesting that the desire for continued acceptance by one\u2019s social network is a trait that afflicts only conservative judges. But the network that counts now is the one that has finally captured the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a fascinating new book titled \u201cThe Company They Keep: How Partisan Divisions Came to the Supreme Court,\u201d to be published early next year, two prominent students of judicial behavior, Neal Devins and Lawrence Baum, explore the Supreme Court\u2019s current polarization through the lens of social psychology. They take issue with the common assumption that the court responds to a broadly defined public opinion. Rather, the authors identify as the \u201cprimary influence\u201d on individual justices not the mood or expressed desires of the public at large but rather \u201cthe elite world in which the justices live both before and after they join the Supreme Court.\u201d They write, \u201cThe justices take cues primarily from the people who are closest to them and whose approval they care most about, and those people are part of political, social and professional elites.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fresh observation of an old phenomenon. It often surprises people to learn, for example, that Roe v. Wade was a 7-to-2 decision, with the majority opinion joined by three of the four appointees of President Richard Nixon. Viewed from the perspective of today\u2019s freighted abortion discourse, the court\u2019s bipartisan consensus sounds barely plausible 45 years later. Though hardly the sole explanation for the court\u2019s decision, it\u2019s significant that by the time the court ruled, the elites of the legal, public health and medical professions \u2014 the justices\u2019 professional and social peers, in other words \u2014 had been calling for abortion\u2019s decriminalization for years.\n\nAmerican elites today are sharply polarized, so it\u2019s not surprising to find both high polarization and strong group cohesion at the Supreme Court. Even Justice Anthony Kennedy, the famous \u201cswing\u201d justice, seemed to throw in the towel in the face of these forces during his final term. While in past terms he had joined the court\u2019s four liberal justices in sharply divided cases to supply a 5-to-4 majority anywhere from a quarter to half the time, that happened not a single time during the term that ended with his retirement last summer."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "Joyce Cohen", "title": "A One-Bedroom and a Sweater for the Dog", "description": "To find their first New York home, a Southerner and his four-legged roommate scour Lower Manhattan for dog-friendly abodes.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/realestate/a-one-bedroom-and-a-sweater-for-the-dog.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/realestate/25Hunt-EastVillage1/25Hunt-EastVillage1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T10:01:21Z", "content": "Josh Collins had never been to New York before last summer.

No other state has a similar active matching program.\n\nThe timing of reform may prove pivotal to what is sure to be one of next year\u2019s biggest legislative fights: renegotiation of the state\u2019s rent laws, which are set to expire in June. If Democrats close the L.L.C. loophole early, developers may lose one powerful means for making their voices heard.\n\nIn the past, real estate groups used L.L.C.s to deluge upstate Republicans, knowing that their constituents would be less likely to care about the industry\u2019s long shadow, according to Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a government reform group."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "HENRY ALFORD", "title": "Page to Screen: When Novelists Turned to TV: Everyone Was Suddenly Using \u2018Reveal\u2019 as a Noun", "description": "Sign of the times?

In the Middle Ages, a noun form emerged \u2014 \u201cinfluentia.\u201d Its meaning was, essentially, astrological: Planets were thought to pour their influences down on Earth, spreading things like benevolence (Jupiter), conflict (Mars) and madness (the moon \u2014 hence \u201clunacy\u201d). \u201cWhat euill starre/On you hath fround, and pourd his influence bad?\u201d asked the Tudor poet Edmund Spenser in 1590.\n\nAlong with this belief came a certain anxiety about its spiritual implications. The medieval Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas accepted that the planets and stars could affect our physical bodies, but he rejected the idea that they could control our minds, which would mean the end of free will. C.S. Lewis summed up medieval attitudes in his 1964 book \u201cThe Discarded Image\u201d: The belief, he wrote, was that influence \u201cgenerates, not a necessity, but only a propensity, to act thus or thus.\u201d And this propensity could be resisted: \u201cThe wise man will over-rule the stars. But more often it will not be resisted, for most men are not wise.\u201d\n\nOver time, as astrology was discarded as junk science, influence gradually became the work not of celestial bodies but of governments and advertisers. Propaganda became easier with the printing press; influence became a bona fide business with the rise of behavioral marketing. Lewis complained that this 20th-century use of \u201cinfluence\u201d had a \u201cwithered senility\u201d in comparison to its powerful original meaning. But that astrological sense of influence as a malign, opaque and distant force \u2014 something that tempts us against our characters or better wisdom \u2014 still lingers in the way people talk about the dark orbits of global power and wealth.

The first argues that Russia is a mafia state in which the main aim of the ruling elite is to steal money at home to conceal and spend abroad. The second states that Mr. Putin is a hostage of his own popularity and that whatever is done in or by Russia is done for the sake of his approval rating.\n\nThese theories provide a convenient framework for making sense of Russia; they are also tinged with moralism. For these reasons, many politicians, analysts and scholars both in Russia and in the West have embraced them. But these explanations fundamentally clash with reality. To truly understand what motivates the Kremlin, we must see how the Kremlin itself undermines those myths.\n\nThere is, indeed, much corruption among the Kremlin\u2019s associates. They profit from running the country, deposit the proceeds in offshore banking centers and the London property market and send their children to be educated in Western schools. But if the Russian elite were really just a mafia state concerned about its own well-being, it would never do anything that got in the way of its overseas investments and spending. Yet Mr. Putin\u2019s bold foreign policy adventures of the past few years \u2014 in particular in Crimea \u2014 have received the support of most of the Russian elite despite leading to stinging sanctions.\n\nAnd certainly, Mr. Putin, like most politicians \u2014 especially authoritarian populists \u2014 cares about his popularity. One of the primary goals of annexing Crimea was to boost his falling approval ratings. But that is not all he cares about. Recent events expose this: In July, Russia\u2019s Parliament voted to raise the retirement age, sparking a wave of discontent. Polls found that up to 90 percent of Russians opposed these measures and there have even been street protests against them. Yet the Kremlin pushes forward with the reforms. This isn\u2019t the only time that Mr. Putin has taken on unpopular domestic policies. He has made other cuts to entitlements and introduced other tolls and taxes that have resulted in significant protests."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "JOHN ELIGON", "title": "You Want to Feed the Hungry?

A replacement crown prince who rose to power under pressure of sanctions would be severely weakened, if not entirely illegitimate. This would serve only to validate Al Qaeda\u2019s anti-Saudi ideology, which depicts the royal family as American stooges. Would a compromised crown prince be a more reliable partner for the United States in stabilizing the Middle East?\n\nIn all likelihood, sanctions would simply embitter Prince Mohammed, who would respond by tacking toward Russia and China.
