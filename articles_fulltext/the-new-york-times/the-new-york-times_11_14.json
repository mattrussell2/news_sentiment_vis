There were collaborations between rappers and singers, devised to bridge the culture and generation gaps (think Jody Watley and Rakim). And hip-hop aggressively borrowed soul melodies via sampling, as exemplified by Bad Boy Records. But by the turn of the century, as hip-hop officially took its place at the center of pop innovation and mainstream dominance, R&B began to feel like a footnote. Young stars like Trey Songz and Ashanti aligned themselves with hip-hop, a strategy of survival but not of confidence.

He was a surfer and skateboarder as a young man. He grew up in San Francisco and worked at a store in the hippie heyday of Haight-Ashbury, selling candles and crystals, a job that allowed him to pursue his passion of music. And then tech money flooded the city, his neighborhood was gentrified, and like so many others he was priced out.\n\nHe left San Francisco a decade ago and settled down in Paradise, Calif., near the woods. By then, he was sick and bedridden and often in pain, but he never stopped thinking of San Francisco. A few months ago he sent his daughter, Angela Loo, on a mission: to go back to the city and take videos of his favorite places, so he could see how they had changed.\n\n\u201cHis San Francisco roots were very important to him,\u201d Ms. Loo said. \u201cIt\u2019s where he got into music. And did his thing and where he raised his kids. It\u2019s his hometown and he loved it very much and he missed it all the time.\u201d\n\nThose videos were some of the last glimpses of the city for Mr. Foss, who died at 63 a few days ago in the wildfire that reduced Paradise to ash. His body was found outside his home, near his minivan, in what Ms. Loo believes was a desperate attempt to escape with his stepson Andrew Burt, his caretaker, as the flames engulfed the street. Mr. Foss\u2019s dog, Bernice, a little brown mutt he had rescued from a shelter, died there too.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which tore through Paradise and its surroundings last week, has become the deadliest wildfire in modern California history, with at least 56 people confirmed dead so far. Another three people were killed in the Woolsey Fire, which raced through the mountains of Southern California near Malibu.\n\nWith so many still unaccounted for and investigators scouring the ruins of Paradise and collecting DNA samples from relatives of the missing, the identities of many more victims are expected to emerge in the coming days and weeks. On Tuesday night, the Butte County sheriff, Kory Honea, said the number of missing was in the hundreds. The department has released a list with 103 names on it, which \u201cin no way is a list of everybody,\u201d said a spokesman for the department, Megan McCann.\n\nAmong those unaccounted for, although not on the list, is Mr. Burt, Ms. Loo\u2019s stepbrother.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have confirmation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I do have confirmation of is that he was last seen trying to help, or get help, for my dad to get him into their van, and failing at it. They just didn\u2019t make it. I can\u2019t imagine that he is alive, but we have not stopped looking. We are still calling the shelters every day. We are calling the hospitals every day.\u201d\n\nImage Ernie Foss\n\nMr. Foss is among a handful of the victims whose names have been released, as authorities slowly add to the roster of the dead. Jesus Fernandez, 48, died of smoke inhalation, probably trying to rescue his dog, King. Mr. Fernandez, nicknamed Zeus, had a son who lives in Las Vegas, and was described by a friend as someone \u201cwho people counted on in rough times.\u201d\n\nAlso killed in the fire was Bill Godbout, 79, an influential figure in the early days of Silicon Valley who ran a popular electronics store. He was well-known in the hacker community, and remembered for his quirks, like his license to fly blimps. Robert Tuck, Mr. Godbout\u2019s grandson, said that Mr. Godbout had stayed behind as his wife and relatives fled, probably to save his three cats.\n\nAs his family drove away, they looked back and \u201ccould see the fire coming down on the house,\u201d Mr. Tuck said through tears. \u201cHe was listening to the radio report and thought he had a little more time.\u201d\n\nAnd while the family of 58-year-old Lolene Rios has kept her listed as missing, her stepdaughter told a reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle that they believed she had died trapped inside her home.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s just a recovery effort,\u201d said Maria Rios, whose father Rick Rios escaped and is now recovering from severe burns on his hands and face. \u201cMy dad is in a lot of pain \u2014 he keeps saying, \u2018I have no skin, no skin.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Loo spoke expansively about her father \u2014 his days as a musician in San Francisco, when he was in so many blues and rock bands that she couldn\u2019t remember any of their names but one, Raine Daze. She recalled how their living room in their cottage in the Fillmore District was turned into a music studio, for recording and teaching lessons to students; how all of his recordings had been lost in the fire; and his last painful years in Paradise with lymphedema, a condition that swells the arms and legs.\n\n\u201cYou know, whenever something like this happens we tend to focus on all the positive attributes of a person,\u201d she said. \u201cGraciously ignoring all of their faults. My dad was not a perfect person. He struggled in life and was perfectly imperfect.\u201d\n\nMuch of Mr. Foss\u2019s music is lost, and so are many old photos, but there is one memento she does have: the scarf her father wore when he played music. A few years ago he said to her, \u201cI want you to take your daddy\u2019s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll scarf.\u201d She described it as \u201clike Mick Jagger\u2019s scarf.\u201d\n\nImage Jesus Fernandez\n\nEvery few months, Ms. Loo, 43, who lives in Oregon, would travel to Paradise to clean her father\u2019s house, stock up at Costco, and fill the freezer with home-cooked meals. \u201cThey lived like men, you know, my dad and my stepbrother,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Paradise, friends dropped by when they were able, and social workers and volunteers came over to keep him company, sometimes to watch his beloved 49ers or Giants with him. But over all, it was a lonely time for Mr. Foss.\n\n\u201cHe was isolated,\u201d said Ms. Loo. \u201cHe was an extrovert. He was a people person. He has been a teacher and a mentor and a friend his whole life.\u201d\n\nHe was also constantly in physical pain, something Mr. Foss wrote about in his last Facebook post, three days before he died, in which he talked about his health, and losing a wife and son in recent years.\n\n\u201cEvery day is a challenge to me physically and emotionally,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI lost my wife six years ago and my firstborn son a little more than three years ago. I am asking for prayers and positive energy.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the lasting memories Ms. Loo has of her father, one that brought her to tears as she recounted it.\n\nMr. Foss also had melanoma, and the few times he got out of the house and out of Paradise were when he would get his cancer treatments.\n\nA few years ago, after being brought home in an ambulance, a light rain \u2014 just a mist \u2014 began falling, and he asked to be left outside, on his gurney, so he could feel the rain and look at the trees. The mist, she said, reminded him of San Francisco."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "KRISTIN WONG", "title": "There\u2019s a Stress Gap Between Men and Women.

The essay sparked a massive thread on MetaFilter, with hundreds of women speaking up about their own experience with emotional labor: the duties that are expected of you, but go unnoticed.\n\nThese invisible duties become apparent only when you don\u2019t do them. I\u2019m reminded of the time I went on an emotional labor strike. I asked my husband to manage an event we were both invited to, and when we showed up two hours late, per his mistake, all eyes were on me. \u201cWe expected you much sooner,\u201d the host said \u2014 only to me.\n\nEmotional labor has mental and physical consequences\n\nLike domestic labor, emotional labor is generally dismissed and not labeled work, but research shows it can be just as exhausting as paid work. Emotional labor can lead to insomnia and family conflict, according to a study published in Personnel Psychology. Sure, circumstantial stress, like losing a job, may lead to these same issues, but emotional labor is not circumstantial. It\u2019s an enduring responsibility based on the socialized gender role of women.\n\nLike Ms. Li, many women try to manage the added stressors to reach what Dr. Joyce said was an unattainable ideal. \u201cSome professional women aspire to do it all: reach the top of the corporate ladder and fly like supermom,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen women don\u2019t reach this ideal, they feel guilty and even more stressed. After her own bout with this, Ms. Li took a step back to regroup, then used her experience to build Sanity & Self, a self-care app and platform for overworked women. \u201cThe realizations I had in that process helped me gain insights and ultimately got me ready to incorporate self-care into my daily life,\u201d she said.\n\nThe stress problem extends beyond mental health when you consider the link between chronic stress, anxiety and heart health. Worse, most of what we know about heart disease \u2014 the leading cause of death in both men and women \u2014 comes from studies involving men, but \u201cthere are many reasons to think that it\u2019s different in women,\u201d Harvard Medical School reported.\n\nFor example, women are more likely to experience disturbed sleep, anxiety and unusual fatigue before a heart attack. Stress is so normalized, it is easy for women to shrug off those symptoms as simply the consequences of stress. Many women also do not experience chest pain before a heart attack the way men do, which leads to fewer women discovering problematic heart issues."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "DAVID M.

But overall the data tell a consistent story about what has happened to capital inflows since the ta\u2026 [+2578 chars]", "fulltext": "Now, when the U.S. reduces its corporate tax rate, this reduces the incentive to engage in such schemes: corporations don\u2019t have to go to Ireland to avoid taxes, they can do it right here in the U.S.A. So you would expect the tax cut to lead to repatriation of assets, and that\u2019s indeed what happened. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, which produces our balance of payments statistics, had a very helpful box on the effects of the TCJA in its latest report on international transactions that included a striking chart on the impact on multinational corporations (Figure 2). Following the tax law\u2019s enactment, U.S. firms had their subsidiaries pay the home company huge dividends; the counterpart of these dividends, on paper, was a sharp drop in investment overseas.\n\nImage Figure 2 Credit Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nBut what did these big numbers correspond to in reality? Quite possibly nothing.\n\nImagine a U.S. company whose overseas subsidiary has $1 billion in a London bank account. Following the enactment of the tax cut, it decides to transfer that $1 billion back to the parent company - but the parent keeps the money where it is. In that case the balance of payments statistics show a big drop in net direct investment abroad, because the parent firm is reducing its apparent stake in the subsidiary. But the reality is that the company still owns that same $1 billion in London - it has just shifted from owning it indirectly via the subsidiary to holding it directly. It\u2019s just accounting, with no real-world effect.\n\nOf course, the company could choose not to keep that $1 billion in a London bank; it might do something else with it, such as buy shares back from its stockholders. But what happens to the money then? The shareholders might themselves buy assets overseas; even if they buy stock here, whoever sells them the stock might invest the proceeds abroad.\n\nIn other words, looking at corporate financial maneuvering after the tax cut doesn\u2019t really tell us anything about whether the cut is, in fact, attracting global capital into the United States. To make that assessment, we need to look at net sales of assets to foreigners by the U.S. as a whole - or, equivalently, at our net sales of goods and services, because the balance of payments always balances: the trade balance is by definition the inverse of the net capital inflow.\n\nWhat actually happened to capital inflows?\n\nIf we\u2019re trying to assess the possible effects of the TCJA on the U.S. ability to invest, we need to know how much, if at all, it promoted true inflows of capital - resources made available to the United States that let us invest more than we ourselves are saving. These inflows can be measured two different ways. One is to look directly at the international financial account: asset transactions with foreigners, where selling assets is an inflow and buying assets an outflow. The other is to look indirectly at the difference between sales and purchases of goods and services, because the trade balance broadly defined (including investment income) - aka the balance on current account - is the flip side of capital inflows.\n\nIn principle these two methods should give the same result. In practice there is sometimes a significant \u201cstatistical discrepancy,\u201d probably because some financial transactions don\u2019t end up being properly reported. This is less of an issue for goods and services, although some of the same strategies used for tax avoidance can distort this balance too.

Cuomo went after Amazon as if he were the desperate patriarch in a 19th-century novel, ready to balloon the family dowry without limit all for the prospect of ensuring that his daughter marry up, even if, in truth, she stood at the pinnacle and could have anyone. Was it really necessary that Amazon get its own helipad when there is one right across the river? Exhausted at the injustice, I tucked into bed at the end of the day with my iPad and streamed the second segment of \u201cThe Worricker Trilogy\u201d on Amazon Prime, barely registering the contradiction.\n\n[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nWe have internalized our use of Amazon to such a degree that we have trouble recognizing our complicity in the manufacture of the company\u2019s own arrogance.

A case I handled long ago captures this. A group of women who worked for a dry cleaner came to our office because they were underpaid, working 56 hours a week for subminimum wages and no overtime.\n\nAs I investigated, I quickly learned how interrelated their problems were. The women, who were Latina, were paid less than their male co-workers. All of the Latino workers, male and female, made less than their non-Latino counterparts. No one made enough to live on, and everyone there was surely exposed to highly toxic chemicals. Over repeated meetings, another story also emerged: The boss routinely made leering comments to the women workers, told them to wear short skirts and, as I later learned, had sex with one of them in a La Guardia Airport hotel \u2014 consensually, he insisted. When I questioned him in sworn testimony about his behavior toward his female employees, he said, \u201cSpanish women like it.\u201d\n\nHow do you tease apart the sexism, racism and economic exploitation in this situation? You can\u2019t. They\u2019re inseparable. What brought the women to our office was their unlawfully low pay. But this was partly a result of discrimination against them based on their sex and national origin, and from an even broader viewpoint, it was a result of their lack of power or a voice on the job.\n\nSo why would it make sense to end forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment only? Why should any company still block people from filing in court when they\u2019re racially harassed or underpaid or paid less because of their national origin? All are offenses against human dignity, and in all of these cases, there is the same tremendous power differential that makes it so hard for people to speak up.\n\nThe workers who walked out at Google have lives very distinct from the immigrant women who spend their days pressing clothes. But at the root of sexual harassment, or any kind of workplace abuse, is abuse of power. Even a Hollywood legend like Gwyneth Paltrow didn\u2019t speak up about Harvey Weinstein because she thought she would be fired."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ALISHA HARIDASANI GUPTA", "title": "Asia and Australia Edition: Brexit, Myanmar, Komodo Dragons: Your Thursday Briefing", "description": "Here\u2019s what you need to know to start your day.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/briefing/brexit-myanmar-komodo-dragons.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/15/briefing/15ambriefing-asia-promo/15ambriefing-asia-slides-slide-V84B-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:28:48Z", "content": "Sri Lankas parliament voted to remove Mahinda Rajapaksa, above, as prime minister, weeks after President Maithripala Sirisena unilaterally fired his predecessor and appointed him, setting off a constitutional crisis.

The House version, passed in May, focused solely on \u201cback end\u201d reforms, such as improving prison conditions and easing inmates\u2019 re-entry into society. But tending to the existing prison population without tempering the draconian sentencing laws that caused that population to explode in recent decades is, as Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has put it, \u201cna\u00efve and unproductive.\u201d That\u2019s why reform advocates saw the House bill as worse than nothing, a cheap attempt by Congress to move past the issue without addressing one of its core problems.\n\nThe Senate bill aims to be more comprehensive. It would reduce mandatory sentencing guidelines for certain drug crimes, allow judges greater wiggle room in sentencing nonviolent drug offenders, do away with the \u201cstacking\u201d provision that tacks on years for the use of a firearm during the commission of a crime and, at long last, make retroactive the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the sentencing gap between crack and powder-cocaine offenses.\n\nDetails of the bill began making the rounds early this week, and the initial reviews among advocates were solid, if not entirely glowing. Most notably, some reformers expressed disappointment that the bulk of sentencing changes would not apply retroactively, leaving thousands of inmates serving excessive terms under the old guidelines. But even the skeptical agreed that the plan was a major step forward.\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice, a prominent voice in the reform movement and one that vigorously opposed the House\u2019s bill, quickly came out in support of this version. \u201cThe original First Step Act would have little effect on reducing prison populations and was a concession to Jeff Sessions \u2014 one of the only people against sentencing reform,\u201d said Inimai Chettiar , head of the center\u2019s Justice Program. \u201cWe support this week\u2019s Senate compromise bill because it includes several key sentencing reform provisions\u201d carried over from the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act.\n\nFurther fueling optimism about the legislation\u2019s future, last week the Fraternal Order of Police issued a statement in support of the bill, specifically endorsing its sentencing reforms. This is a significant shift from February, when the group sent Mr. Trump a letter opposing previous sentencing reform efforts. The bill has also been endorsed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, the National District Attorneys Association and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives.

It is the driving force behind public health policies like mandatory calorie counts on restaurant menus and food labels. Many experts say that the underlying cause of the obesity epidemic is that Americans eat too many calories of all kinds, prompted by easy access to cheap and highly palatable foods, and that they need to exercise portion control. On its website, for example, the National Institutes of Health encourages people to count calories and warns that dietary fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbs: \u201cYou need to limit fats to avoid extra calories,\u201d it states.\n\nBut experts like Dr. Ludwig argue that the obesity epidemic is driven by refined carbohydrates such as sugar, juices, bagels, white bread, pasta and heavily processed cereals. These foods tend to spike blood sugar and insulin, a hormone that promotes fat storage, and they can increase appetite. Dr. Ludwig and his colleague Dr. Cara Ebbeling have published studies suggesting that diets with different ratios of carbs and fat but identical amounts of calories have very different effects on hormones, hunger and metabolism. He has also written a best-selling book on lower-carb diets.\n\nDr. Hall and others disagree. They have published studies disputing the notion that carb-restricted diets accelerate metabolism and fat loss. Dr. Hall said that low-carb diets have many benefits: They can help people with Type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels, for example. But he argues that the carb and insulin explanation for obesity is too simplistic and has been \u201cexperimentally falsified\u201d in rigorous studies.\n\nDr. Hall published a meta-analysis of feeding studies last year that suggested that energy expenditure was actually slightly greater on low-fat diets. But Dr. Ludwig pointed out that those studies were very short, with none lasting longer than a month and most lasting a week or less. He said the process of adapting to a low-carb diet can take a month or longer.\n\n\u201cA few days, or a couple weeks, is not enough time to make any meaningful conclusion about how diets affect metabolism over the long term,\u201d he added."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ArtsJournal1", "title": "Toning Down The Asian Stereotypes In \u2018Nutcracker\u2019", "description": "Marie\u2019s tour with the Nutcracker Prince in Act II includes, of course, Spanish chocolate, Arabian coffee, and Chinese tea.

A printout of his hours showed that on May 23, the night of the killing, he had punched out at 11:01 p.m.\n\nMr. Jones had said that he and several co-workers then boarded a No. 20 Bee-Line bus near Central Park Avenue and Tuckahoe Road and rode into the Bronx, where they stopped at a check-cashing outlet, Pay-O-Matic, near Montefiore Medical Center.\n\nWhen Mr. Dowd visited Pay-O-Matic, he learned not only that it had a copy of Mr. Jones\u2019s check, but that it took photographs of customers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEverything was time stamped,\u201d Mr. Dowd recalled. A photograph shows Mr. Jones cashing his check at 11:39 p.m.\n\nMr. Dowd said Pay-O-Matic also had a photo of one of Mr. Jones\u2019s co-workers cashing a check, in which Mr. Jones was visible in the background. That further corroborated his story that he had had been with his co-workers that night.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Mr. Dowd still needed one more piece of evidence \u2014 the MetroCard.\n\nMr. Jones said that after cashing the check, he and his co-workers had walked to a friend\u2019s apartment for a drink, and that he had then entered the 205th Street station on the D Line, less than a mile from the check-cashing outlet and about five miles from the shooting scene. He rode the train to 182nd Street to visit his girlfriend, he said, stayed with her until about 2 a.m., and then took a subway home.\n\nAfter the investigator retrieved the MetroCard from the jail, Frederick H. Cohn, Mr. Jones\u2019s other lawyer, called New York City Transit and asked to have the card\u2019s history traced. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, how long is this going to take?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Cohn recalled.\n\nHe said the employee said it would take three months. \u201cShe said, \u2018We\u2019re very busy.

Using the serial number of Mr. Jones\u2019s seven-day unlimited MetroCard, the transit agency was able to report that Mr. Jones\u2019s card had been used three times that night \u2014 on the No. 20 bus (the Bee-Line, the Westchester County bus system, accepts MetroCards) at 11:12 p.m.; at the 205th Street station at 12:30 a.m.; and at the 182nd-183rd Street station at 2 a.m. \u2014 all as he had said.\n\nMr. Jones\u2019s lawyers say it would have been physically impossible for him to commit the crime and be where his MetroCard was used. They say the card was in his possession the whole time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce presented with the new information, prosecutors agreed that Mr. Jones could be released on bond.\n\nBut they objected strenuously when lawyers for his brother made a similar request. The prosecutors said that their witness might have been wrong about Jason, but had correctly identified Corey.\n\nThe judge, Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan, earlier had refused to grant bail to Corey Jones, even after several witnesses said he had been with them at the time of the shooting. But, in a hearing last month, Judge Marrero suggested the new information could not be ignored.\n\n\u201cIt seems somewhat implausible,\u201d he said, that the government\u2019s witness saw the event and was \u201cright about one and mistaken about the other.\u201d\n\nThe judge granted Corey Jones bail. Prosecutors have not dropped the charges, and said in court last month that their investigation was continuing. They declined to comment about the case outside court.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Marrero paraphrased a saying about change by the Greek philosopher Heraclitus.

Prisons exist to lower crime rates. So why not reward private prisons for doing that? Judge them on performance, as Mr. Beasley said.\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t use performance-based contracts.

Two relatively new private prisons have contracts that give them bonuses for doing better than government prisons at cutting recidivism.

In Yorkshire, even more than 400 years after the reign of Henry VIII, Catholics were a small, feared and embattled minority \u2014 as a 9-year-old I was spat upon in the street for raising money for a Catholic charity. It was confusing because to me, my family, friends and teachers (mostly nuns), Catholics were Good, the norm. Out on the street, and to our neighbors, Catholics were Bad, other. So I was aware of dueling cultural narratives, and this, perhaps, is what inoculated me against other cultural stories \u2014 though only partially.\n\nWhen I was very young \u2014 4 or 5, before I was fully sexual \u2014 I knew I was a girl who liked other girls. I didn\u2019t really think about it \u2014 it just was, utterly obvious. It seemed perfectly natural to me because no one thought to talk about sexuality to a 4-year-old, and queer people \u2014 and their treatment by society \u2014 was invisible to me. So I was free to tell my own story: that I was amazing, and that if I fancied girls, then fancying girls must be amazing, too.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was 9 or 10 that I found out that the dominant story of queerness \u2014 as told by family, church, school, neighbors and books like the tortured 1928 lesbian novel \u201cThe Well of Loneliness\u201d \u2014 was that it was Bad. But by then I also had experience of the cultural story of Catholicism being not entirely true, so it wasn\u2019t too hard to counterprogram anti-lesbian bias with my own, better story. As a result, I did not develop internalized homophobia \u2014 or thought I hadn\u2019t."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "JULIAN CASTRO", "title": "Nonfiction: What It Means to Be \u2018Latinx,\u2019 and What That Means for America", "description": "Julian Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and Obama cabinet member, reviews Ed Morales\u2019s new book on the diversity and hybridity of Latino identity.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/books/review/latinx-ed-morales.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/books/review/18castro/18castro-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T10:00:07Z", "content": "LATINX The New Force in American Politics and Culture By Ed Morales 368 pp. Verso. $24.95.

I thought back to my freshman year of college in 1992. As I sat in a computer room in my dorm working away on an early Macintosh, a red squiggly line immediately appeared underneath the word \u201cChicano\u201d after I typed it into the paper I was writing about my family\u2019s background. When I hit the spell check to see what the problem was, Microsoft Word had a suggestion: Chicago. \u201cYou don\u2019t even exist,\u201d popped into my head. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t a new experience. Years earlier, in middle school, I\u2019d been asked to fill out a form that included a question about my background. There were three options to choose from: black, white or other. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not black or white,\u201d I remember thinking, pencil in hand, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like the sound of \u2018other.\u2019\u201d I left it blank.\n\nFor many Latinos, stories like these are all too familiar. In \u201cLatinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,\u201d Ed Morales fills in that blank as well as the long, painful, complex and intersectional struggle for identity that has shaped America\u2019s Latino community. As Morales notes, Latinx is just the latest in a series of terms, from Hispanic to Latino/a and even Latin@, employed to refer to individuals of Latin American heritage in an inclusive way.\n\nReading Morales\u2019s dissection of Latinx identity formation, however, one begins to believe that the x in \u201cLatinx\u201d is more than just a means of providing gender-neutrality. As in algebra, the x is variable. How a Latino or Latina perceives himself or herself \u2014 and how he or she is perceived by others \u2014 often depends on context. Unhappy with the binary notion of race popular in the United States, Morales offers the concept of mestizaje, or hybridity, that encompasses a spectrum of identity, the result of hundreds of years of intermixing among African, European and indigenous peoples in Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean. Latinos can be black, white, brown or anything in between. Skin color, national origin, whether one lives in the mainland United States or outside of it, and one\u2019s ability to speak Spanish, not to mention gender and sexual orientation, all play a role in one\u2019s self-concept."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "SETH KUGEL", "title": "How to Up the Spontaneity Quotient on Your Next Trip", "description": "Predictable vacations are so, well, predictable.

Bury your phone in your backpack and explore a neighborhood blind or with a paper map, asking for advice along the way. In the country? Take a drive down a local road and stop whenever you see something interesting: a high school baseball game, a yak farm, a bait shop. (Don\u2019t fish? Then ask for directions.)\n\nBe on a mission\n\nTo give some structure to your adventuring, come up with a nonserious goal that will add an element of fun and nudge you off the tourist trail. Make it your mission to find the best bookstore in town, try every brand of local candy or search for the weirdest ice cream flavors. In England, declare that by the end of your trip everyone in the group must choose a Premiere League soccer team to root for when you get home. Locals will surely lobby for their club. In northeast Portugal I vowed to learn a few words of the local language, Mirandese. People were delighted to teach me \u2014 though, I imagine, not nearly so much as the English would be to talk about why their football team is superior.\n\nSay \u201cyes\u201d\n\nSometimes an opportunity for a detour or a change of plans will arise that you (or your travel companions) might think is silly or a little nerve-racking.\n\nShould we turn down that side street just to see what\u2019s there? Should we get off at a random subway stop and explore? Stop off at a supermarket to see what kinds of cereal they have? Attend that local community potluck we saw a flier for? The answers are yes, yes, yes and yes. What do you have to lose if it goes well? The second museum or third monument of the day? And what if it doesn\u2019t? You\u2019ll be set back 15 minutes? There\u2019s really only one good reason to say no to an idea: if it would put you in physical danger.\n\nDespite what you learned as a kid, \u201cyes\u201d is also the answer to: Should you talk to strangers? (At least when culturally appropriate.) I sometimes like to set a goal \u2014 to talk to five random people a day, for example. Then I ask any dumb question that comes to mind. At a restaurant in Naples, I asked the Italian family at the table next to mine how their fritti misti appetizer was. They gave me the rest of the plate. I asked a fellow customer in a South Dakota gas station if there was any difference between the pot of coffee she was pouring and the one she wasn\u2019t. It was fresher, she said. I doubt it was, and didn\u2019t care anyway, but she turned out to be a fun Estonian exchange student with great stories of her journeys across America.\n\nSeek community\n\nGreat things also happen when your family or friends or friends of friends live in your destination. So seek out your Hungarian third cousins and the Vietnamese college roommate of your high school prom date for a meal or tea or some advice. No connections? Search for clubs or groups or professional organizations in your areas of interest. Surgeons may seek to tour a local hospital; journalists a newsroom; police officers a precinct. There\u2019s no harm in trying. It just takes a quick search for accountants heading to Barbados to find an email for the I.C.A.B. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of Barbados, a real organization). The worst thing that could happen is nothing. Maybe you\u2019ll score some great tips on beaches or night life or even make a friend. You don\u2019t have to actually want to learn anything from the B.S.C. (Barcelona Sweater Club, a made-up organization) . You\u2019re just looking for a way to make a connection.\n\nSeth Kugel, a former Frugal Traveler columnist, is the author of \u201cRediscovering Travel: A Guide for the Globally Curious\u201d (Norton), published on Nov. 13.\n\nFollow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

She knew their names, and the names of their children. Jos\u00e9 spoke of his son\u2019s difficulties with school. Victoria listened and made suggestions. She knew the nurses\u2019 names and concerns as well; how long their commutes were, how they tried to balance the personal and professional demands in their lives.\n\nOver time, Victoria became increasingly grateful for the kindness and compassion of others, whether it came from her husband, Pat, who stayed with her each day (my visits provided necessary respite for him); or from her sons, Nick and Will, whose faces beamed at her from large poster-size photos they had placed in her room; or from the friends who looked after her family, feeding them every day for the eight-plus months of her continuous hospitalization.\n\nSitting with Victoria allowed me to reconnect with a part of myself I had been suppressing for years. Her courage rubbed off on me. Blood test results set the expectations for each new day. A higher white blood count would allow Victoria the freedom to step from her room into the hallway to take a few steps around her unit, albeit with a thick filtration mask covering her mouth and nose. If her counts were low, she would sit confined to her room, often for days on end, gazing longingly through a sealed window at people six stories below walking the garden paths and at the trees swaying in the breeze.\n\nI went to City of Hope to support my sister, and what I found there was gratitude: appreciation for others; reveling in small pleasures we usually take for granted, like a hot shower, sunlight, a walk outdoors.\n\nVictoria\u2019s gift was a tangible lesson, something I have been able to carry with me.

I was initially hesitant and fearful as I entered the examining room to see her one afternoon after a long day in clinic. She was going to need me to surgically place a reservoir into her brain to deliver chemotherapy. My colleagues and I also planned to perform focused radiation treatments to two tumors in her brain that were growing quickly. Meghan sat bald and proudly beautiful in my examining room, her mother there to support her.\n\nPreviously, I would have thought nothing of her shaved head, but now I understood Meghan had a story to tell.

Taking these reasons seriously opens up conversations that may help our adolescents look after themselves and their partners down the line.\n\nSo why do young people mix sex and alcohol?\n\nTeens Drink Because They\u2019re Nervous About Intimacy\n\nTeenagers may view all anxiety as problematic and drink to blunt the jitters that are a natural part of a budding romantic life. Unfortunately, anxiety, like stress, has gotten a bad rap. Nerves can get out of control, but feeling occasionally anxious is a normal and healthy part of life. And what could be more normal than feeling awkward about physical intimacy, especially when it is new and unfamiliar?\n\nWe do right by young people when we acknowledge that apprehension is to be expected in the early days of physical romance or when being intimate with a new person. As the psychologist Richard Weissbourd, the faculty director of Harvard University\u2019s Making Caring Common Project, explains, the first forays into sexual activity are bound to be anxiety-provoking because that they are often \u201coverloaded with expectations as well as worries about performance.\u201d\n\nIt helps to remind teenagers that their nerves are not only normal, but designed to keep them safe. \u201cWhen it comes to your love life,\u201d we might say, \u201chaving butterflies can be part of the fun. But if you find yourself in a situation that makes you really nervous, pay attention to that warning signal. The last thing you should do is start drinking to relax.\u201d\n\nThey Think Everybody Else Is Having Drunken Hookups\n\nThe popular media has done its part to suggest that drunken one-night stands have replaced courtship and romance among young people. According to Ms. Orenstein, \u201cThis is the script that gets handed down: You\u2019re supposed to get super wasted and have sex with somebody.\u201d When teenagers believe they should be making out with virtual strangers, \u201cthe only way to do that,\u201d notes Ms. Orenstein, is to drink \u201cto numb their anxiety and embarrassment about it.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "MANOHLA DARGIS", "title": "Women, What Did You Learn From the Movies?", "description": "Movies have been teaching us lessons for their entire history.

But analysts, historians and veterans of previous administrations said there were few comparable instances of a commander in chief warning about what he called a looming threat, only to drop it as soon as people voted.\n\nWhile the caravan has faded from television screens, the costs of Mr. Trump\u2019s response to it have not. Nearly 6,000 active-duty troops remain deployed from the Gulf Coast to Southern California, where they are putting up tents and stringing concertina wire to face a ragtag band that is still not near the border."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "MATT STEVENS and ANDREW R.

There is no denying that Mr. McCarthy, who is known for his encyclopedic knowledge of congressional districts and warm relationships with rank-and-file Republicans, has less interest in the technical details of policy than Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin, who revels in his reputation as an \u201cideas guy.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. McCarthy is not always savvy about how he approaches an issue. When he decided six weeks before the midterm contests to introduce a bill to fully fund Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall over seven years, he neither worked with the White House nor gave advance notice that it was coming, according to two people familiar with the conversations who spoke of condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.\n\nStill, for Republicans licking their wounds from this month\u2019s drubbing and looking toward a grim two years in the minority where they have little ability to influence policy, Mr. McCarthy\u2019s political talents appear to be matched to the moment.\n\nGroomed by Bill Thomas, the former House Ways and Means Committee chairman who represented his Bakersfield district, the bubbly Mr. McCarthy succeeded his more cerebral and irascible boss in 2007 and quickly worked his way up through Republican ranks, rising to the third-ranking position within four years. He was one of the \u201cYoung Guns,\u201d a triumvirate of 40-something conservatives including Mr. Ryan and Eric Cantor who styled themselves the future of the Republican Party, and published a book whose cover depicted them all, smiling and impressively coifed, on the balcony of the Capitol.\n\nMr. Cantor, then the No. 2 Republican, was defeated in a primary in 2014 by Dave Brat, a college professor who harnessed Tea Party discontent to topple him, and Mr. McCarthy slid easily into the job. (Mr. Brat is among the Republicans swept out by Democrats in last week\u2019s elections.) A year later, Mr. Boehner, facing a revolt from the Freedom Caucus, was forced out as speaker. Mr. McCarthy was the presumed heir apparent, but he stumbled over policy pronouncements and infuriated allies by blurting out that a committee investigating the Benghazi attacks was created to sink Hillary Clinton\u2019s popularity. He took himself out of the running.\n\nNow Mr. Ryan, another Young Gun, is retiring, and the lone survivor, Mr. McCarthy, is in line for the top job."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "Kate Taylor", "title": "In New Class of Young Lawmakers, a Former Girl Scout Goes to the Statehouse", "description": "Cassandra Levesque, 19, had once urged New Hampshire lawmakers to raise the age of marriage in the state.

Buffalo is the kind of place where we expect to bump into our politicians and professional athletes in the grocery store, and we see nothing rude in stopping them to talk about the game last Sunday. This is especially true on Grand Island.\n\nDespite this, Chris Collins said I should fear Nate \u2014 because he speaks Korean. A Collins campaign ad that ran just days before the election shows a video of Mr. McMurray bowing and speaking in Korean in slow motion. Beneath him runs a subtitle warning that Mr. McMurray \u201cworked to send jobs to China and Korea.\u201d In the background an image of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, flashes by. \u201cYou can take Nate McMurray at his word,\u201d warns the ad. His Korean word.\n\nYet Mr. McMurray, who is married to a Korean woman, never said anything in the video about jobs, and there is no evidence he ever \u201cworked to send\u201d American jobs overseas. He posted the video himself on YouTube in June as a gesture of international good will before President Trump\u2019s nuclear summit with Mr. Kim.\n\nMr. Collins was implicitly attacking Mr. McMurray\u2019s Korean wife and his Korean-speaking children. That\u2019s not how things normally work on Grand Island. \u201cBig island, small town\u201d goes the saying. It\u2019s Republican in a keep-my-taxes-low sort of way.

(Disclosure: my wife, Jessica Castner, while not a paid member of his staff, has been Mr. McMurray\u2019s science adviser for environmental issues.)\n\nA charismatic campaigner, Mr. McMurray crisscrossed the district and likely met many of the people who voted for him. Mr. Collins dropped out of the race after being indicted, then got back in, did almost no campaigning, spoke to only one or two friendly members of the news media, has never held a town hall and has sworn he never will. He\u2019s not around to stop at the grocery store.\n\nYet he appears to have won in this district that cast 59 percent of its votes for Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nOur country\u2019s tribalism was on full display in the 27th, with party loyalty, or Trump loyalty, apparently overcoming consideration of the quality and character of the individual candidates.

Through services like Flickr, then Facebook and Instagram, we tried to curate our images by getting others to do it for us. The best photos of you were the ones that were ranked highly in your social feed; the worst were the ones you didn\u2019t post.\n\nBut social media created another set of problems \u2014 there was a fear of missing out, a sense of performative anxiety, loneliness and an erosion of privacy. \u201cThere was a sense in which because everything was public, young people had to constantly curate the idea of themselves in public,\u201d said Mr. Hand.\n\nGoogle, too, tried to play the social photo game. The earliest incarnation of Google Photos was part of Google Plus, the search company\u2019s ill-fated, just-shuttered social network. A few years ago, after realizing that social networking was not its forte, Google went back to the drawing board with Photos.\n\nIts reimagined service would do three things: Offer nearly limitless storage for your photos essentially free (you can pay more to have your images stored in higher-resolution sizes). It put them in the cloud, so they could be accessed anywhere. And, crucially, Photos would lean on Google\u2019s famed A.I. to address what it saw as the key problem of the smartphone era \u2014 the fact that we all take photos but rarely look at them.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that you would never relive or reminisce about any of these moments,\u201d said Anil Sabharwal, the Google vice president who led the team that built Photos, and still runs it. \u201cYou would go on this beautiful vacation, you\u2019d take hundreds of beautiful photos, years would pass, and you would never look at any of them.\u201d\n\nWhen it started in 2015, Google Photos brought immediate relief. For instance, face recognition made sharing pictures automatic. Now, when I take a photo of my kids, Google recognizes them and shares those photos with my wife; her photos are shared with me. Incredibly, instantly, without thinking, we each have a complete collection of the children\u2019s photos, and any anxiety about keeping them secure has vanished."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "Julie Lasky", "title": "$1.4 Million Homes in Massachusetts, New York and Missouri", "description": "A condominium in an 1898 schoolhouse outside Boston, an 1840 Carpenter Gothic house in the Hudson Valley and a 1911 estate in St. Louis.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/realestate/1-4-million-homes-in-massachusetts-new-york-and-missouri.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/realestate/18WYG-slide-E8PS/18WYG-slide-E8PS-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:00:00Z", "content": "Size: 3,000 square feet Price per square foot: $467 Indoors: Tucked under a portico at the top of a bluestone terrace, the formal front entrance opens to a foyer with a staircase.
