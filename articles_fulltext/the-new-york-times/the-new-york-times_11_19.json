It is also central to his survival strategy: The president burnishes the swaggering, politically incorrect persona that thrills his base, even as he siphons attention away from the substance of the real outrages that his administration is perpetrating on a near-daily basis. Who has time to focus on the finer points of trade policy or prescription drug costs or the continuing assault on democratic institutions when the leader of the free world is tweeting bathroom humor?\n\nThis is how Mr. Trump rolls. And if you think he has been over-the-top while his Republican enablers have controlled all of Congress, just wait until the Democrats take over the House in January. This president has repeatedly made clear that he considers himself above the law and accountable to no one. He is unlikely to greet Democratic efforts at oversight with any sort of restraint. Expect the nicknames to get nastier and the attacks more gratuitous. Mr. Trump thrives down in the mud and is eager to drag his opposition down with him.\n\nOver the past two years, there has been much talk about the risk of the public becoming exhausted by Mr. Trump\u2019s constant outrages \u2014 of allowing him to normalize bad, dangerous behavior. That remains a risk, but only if we continue to let his potty mouth consume so much public attention.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s critics should continue fighting fiercely against his attempts \u2014 on Twitter and off \u2014 to undermine the rule of law, to rig the system in favor of himself and his cronies and to take down not only the Constitution but also quite possibly, if he gets the chance, the Ptolemaic model, Newton\u2019s Law, and maybe even the Pythagorean theorem in order to establish himself as the sole arbiter of truth."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "JEAN RUTTER and HIROKO MASUIKE", "title": "California Wildfires, Nancy Pelosi, China: Your Monday Evening Briefing", "description": "Here\u2019s what you need to know at the end of the day.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/briefing/california-wildfires-nancy-pelosi-china.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/19/briefing/111918evening-briefing-promo/111918evening-briefing-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:24:33Z", "content": "10.

Ya hab\u00eda visto ese tipo de videos producidos con inteligencia artificial \u2014los que hace Facebook del resumen de tu a\u00f1o son una desgracia recurrente\u2014, as\u00ed que no esperaba mucho. Entonces, presion\u00e9 reproducir y, en treinta segundos, estaba hecho una ruina, con la cara larga y llorosa.\n\nEl video era de mi hija de 5 a\u00f1os, Samara: casi cada momento que ha estado despierta ha sido conmemorado de forma minuciosa y permanente por m\u00ed, su padre obsesionado con las c\u00e1maras. Mi obsesi\u00f3n ha creado una pesadilla archiv\u00edstica; los videos y las fotos de Samara y su hermano mayor, Khalil, ambos nacidos en la era de los tel\u00e9fonos inteligentes, ahora abarcan varios terabytes \u2014m\u00e1s im\u00e1genes de las que un humano podr\u00eda tener el tiempo de revisar de manera exhaustiva\u2014. Alguien se podr\u00eda preguntar, \u00bfpara qu\u00e9 capturar todos esos momentos?\n\nBien, en esta simple colecci\u00f3n de dos minutos, Google Fotos me permiti\u00f3 observar un destello de la respuesta.\n\nLas computadoras de Google pueden reconocer rostros, incluso los que envejecen. Google Fotos tambi\u00e9n parece entender el tono y el valor emocional de las interacciones humanas, cosas como las sonrisas, las risitas nerviosas, fruncir el ce\u00f1o, los berrinches, los bailes de alegr\u00eda e incluso fragmentos de di\u00e1logos como \u201c\u00a1Feliz cumplea\u00f1os!\u201d o \u201c\u00a1Bien hecho!\u201d. Sincronizado con una m\u00fasica de pel\u00edcula de Hollywood, el resultado fue un montaje en el que se mezclaron eventos que eran de una importancia evidente \u2014cumplea\u00f1os, obras de teatro escolares\u2014 con decenas de momentos comunes y corrientes de dicha infantil.\n\nAh\u00ed estaba Samara de beb\u00e9 cuando le cortaron el pelo, cuando dio unos pocos pasos tambaleantes; Samara de peque\u00f1a cuando jugaba con su hermano, cuando peleaba con \u00e9l, cuando se zambull\u00eda con bravura en su clase de nataci\u00f3n; Samara ya en edad preescolar mientras com\u00eda pizza en un viaje en auto, cuando le sacaba la lengua a la c\u00e1mara. No puedo publicar el video aqu\u00ed; ser\u00eda como si mostrara su diario. Sin embargo, si Samara alguna vez se postula como presidenta de su clase en el k\u00ednder, el video de Google podr\u00eda ser equivalente al video Man From Hope de Bill Clinton y ganar\u00eda con un triunfo aplastante.\n\nA esto me refiero cuando hablo de un \u201cgolpe que me tom\u00f3 por sorpresa\u201d: \u00bfqui\u00e9n creer\u00eda que un software le har\u00eda llorar? Las im\u00e1genes en Instagram y Snapchat podr\u00e1n conmoverte en el d\u00eda a d\u00eda, pero Google Fotos no es una red social; es una red personal, un servicio que comenz\u00f3 hace tres a\u00f1os, cuyo objetivo en esencia era funcionar como una base de datos que albergara nuestras crecientes colecciones de fotos privadas, y un servicio que en su mayor\u00eda dirigen m\u00e1quinas, no otros humanos que publican cosas a las que les dan me gusta.\n\nY, a pesar de todo, de las tecnolog\u00edas que uso con regularidad, Google Fotos se ha convertido en una de las m\u00e1s relevantes en t\u00e9rminos emocionales. Es extraordinaria, no solo por el grado de utilidad que tiene, sino porque ha eliminado cualquier dolor de cabeza que provocaban el almacenamiento y la b\u00fasqueda a trav\u00e9s del tsunami de fotos que todos producimos. M\u00e1s a\u00fan: Google Fotos es extraordinaria porque presagia un posible entendimiento de nosotros mismos por medio de la fotograf\u00eda.\n\nCon su enfoque intenso en la estructuraci\u00f3n por medio de inteligencia artificial, Google Fotos sugiere el inicio de una nueva era de historiadores robot personalizados. Los billones de im\u00e1genes que tomamos todos se convertir\u00e1n en la materia prima de los algoritmos que organizar\u00e1n los recuerdos y construir\u00e1n las narrativas sobre nuestras experiencias humanas m\u00e1s \u00edntimas. En el futuro, los robots sabr\u00e1n todo de nosotros y contar\u00e1n nuestras historias.\n\nNo obstante, nos estamos adelantando. Antes de preocuparnos por la ciencia ficci\u00f3n del ma\u00f1ana, vale la pena maravillarse con la utilidad b\u00e1sica que Google Fotos tiene en la actualidad. Las empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas han intentado crear mecanismos para administrar fotos digitales desde que comenzamos a desechar los rollos de pel\u00edcula. La mayor\u00eda de los esfuerzos han fracasado; mientras nuestras c\u00e1maras mejoran, tomamos m\u00e1s fotos, y mientras m\u00e1s fotos tomamos, somos menos capaces de organizar el almacenamiento.\n\n\u201cCon la invenci\u00f3n de los m\u00f3viles, no hab\u00eda nada que hicieran los humanos, absolutamente nada, que no retrataran tambi\u00e9n en una imagen\u201d, coment\u00f3 Martin Hand, soci\u00f3logo de la Universidad Queen, en Kingston, Ontario, y autor de Ubiquitous Photography, una investigaci\u00f3n acad\u00e9mica sobre el dichoso problema de tener demasiadas fotos. \u201cPero esto gener\u00f3 sus propios problemas: se volvi\u00f3 un asunto abrumador\u201d.\n\nHace m\u00e1s de una d\u00e9cada, el mundo de la tecnolog\u00eda lleg\u00f3 a una soluci\u00f3n parcial para la sobrecarga de fotos: hacer que las im\u00e1genes se volvieran sociales. Por medio de servicios como Flickr, despu\u00e9s Facebook e Instagram, intentamos organizar nuestras im\u00e1genes haciendo que otros lo hicieran por nosotros. Las mejores fotos eran las que ten\u00edan calificaciones m\u00e1s altas en tu perfil social; las peores, las que no publicaste.\n\nSin embargo, las redes sociales crearon otra serie de problemas: hab\u00eda un temor a quedarse fuera, una sensaci\u00f3n de ansiedad performativa, de soledad y una erosi\u00f3n de la privacidad. \u201cHab\u00eda un sentimiento en el que, debido a que todo era p\u00fablico, los j\u00f3venes deb\u00edan editar constantemente la idea p\u00fablica de s\u00ed mismos\u201d, coment\u00f3 Hand.\n\nDe la misma manera, Google intent\u00f3 participar en el juego de las fotos sociales. La primera encarnaci\u00f3n de Google Fotos era parte de Google Plus, la red social de la empresa de b\u00fasquedas, la cual ten\u00eda el destino sellado y acaba de cerrar. Hace algunos a\u00f1os, despu\u00e9s de haberse percatado de que las redes sociales no eran su fuerte, Google regres\u00f3 a la mesa de dise\u00f1o con Google Fotos.\n\nSu servicio renovado hac\u00eda tres cosas: ofrec\u00eda un almacenamiento casi ilimitado y gratuito para tus fotos (se puede pagar m\u00e1s a fin de que tus im\u00e1genes est\u00e9n almacenadas en tama\u00f1os con una mejor resoluci\u00f3n). Las pon\u00eda en la nube, as\u00ed que pod\u00edas tener acceso a ellas en cualquier lugar. Y, lo m\u00e1s crucial, Fotos podr\u00eda depender de la afamada inteligencia artificial de Google para solucionar lo que la empresa percib\u00eda como el problema clave de la era de los celulares: el hecho de que todos podemos tomar fotos, pero es rara la ocasi\u00f3n en que las vemos.\n\n\u201cNos dimos cuenta de que nunca ibas a evocar o rememorar ninguno de esos momentos\u201d, coment\u00f3 Anil Sabharwal, vicepresidente de Google que dirigi\u00f3 el equipo que construy\u00f3 Fotos y a\u00fan lo encabeza. \u201cTe ibas a unas vacaciones hermosas, tomabas cientos de fotos incre\u00edbles, pasaban los a\u00f1os y nunca las volv\u00edas a ver\u201d.\n\nCuando comenz\u00f3 en 2015, Google Fotos gener\u00f3 un alivio inmediato. Por ejemplo, el reconocimiento facial hizo que se pudieran compartir fotos de forma autom\u00e1tica. Ahora, cuando tomo una foto de mis hijos, Google los reconoce y comparte esas fotos con mi esposa; sus im\u00e1genes se comparten conmigo. De una manera incre\u00edble, instant\u00e1nea y sin tener que pensarlo, cada uno tiene una colecci\u00f3n completa de las fotos de nuestros hijos, y ha desaparecido la ansiedad de mantenerlas seguras.\n\nLuego, tenemos los recordatorios diarios de Google para que rememores. Es dif\u00edcil exagerar cuando menciono qu\u00e9 tan buenas son las m\u00e1quinas de Google para escarbar en tu colecci\u00f3n y encontrar nuevas cosas que te puedan asombrar. En una serie, llamada \u201cAntes y despu\u00e9s\u201d, Google encontrar\u00e1 fotos de la misma persona, o grupos de personas, en poses similares en dos periodos diferentes: tus hijos en el primer d\u00eda de escuela de este a\u00f1o y el mismo d\u00eda del a\u00f1o pasado, o la foto que tomaste frente al edificio Empire State hace diez a\u00f1os y la de hoy.\n\nEl mes pasado, Google lanz\u00f3 un nuevo dispositivo para el hogar, el Home Hub, un aparato activado por voz que tiene una pantalla donde muestra una interminable presentaci\u00f3n de diapositivas con este tipo de carnada nost\u00e1lgica. Es m\u00e1gico. Llevo m\u00e1s de una semana con el Home Hub y ha alterado de manera profunda la experiencia que tengo con mis fotos. Han adquirido vida propia.\n\nQu\u00e9 tanto los recuerdos organizados por medio de la inteligencia artificial est\u00e1n dando forma a nuestras narrativas sobre nosotros mismos.\n\nY, a pesar de lo que me cuesta dejar de usar Google Fotos, tambi\u00e9n estoy un poco aterrorizado por lo que promete para el futuro. Hay un mont\u00f3n de investigaci\u00f3n de ciencias sociales que muestra c\u00f3mo las fotos alteran nuestros recuerdos de una forma significativa. Un estudio prob\u00f3 que cuando tomamos fotos sin pensar se reduce nuestra capacidad de recordar eventos en el mundo que nos rodea. Las fotos tambi\u00e9n dan forma a la percepci\u00f3n que tenemos de nosotros mismos, hasta el punto de crear nuevos recuerdos: una foto falsa te puede convencer de que algo te pas\u00f3 aunque nunca haya sucedido.\n\nAl tomar todo esto en cuenta, me preocupa qu\u00e9 tanto los recuerdos organizados por medio de la inteligencia artificial est\u00e1n dando forma a nuestras narrativas sobre nosotros mismos. Pienso en Samara \u2014y los ni\u00f1os como ella\u2014: c\u00f3mo un d\u00eda ver\u00e1 videos como el que Google produjo sobre ella, y sacar\u00e1 ciertas conclusiones sobre su ni\u00f1ez solo porque unas m\u00e1quinas de empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas con fines de lucro que reciben financiamiento de la publicidad tomaron decisiones sobre qu\u00e9 tipo de escenas iban a mostrar y cu\u00e1les iban a ocultar.\n\nEn este momento, a\u00fan no hay ninguna calamidad: los videos de Google Fotos son alegres y brillantes. No obstante, si la historia depende de qui\u00e9n cuenta tu historia, Google Fotos nos lleva a un nuevo terreno.\n\nEn la actualidad, las m\u00e1quinas est\u00e1n entendiendo cada vez m\u00e1s nuestro mundo humano y dan forma a nuestra realidad de la manera m\u00e1s profunda posible y, como las mismas c\u00e1maras, son inevitables."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ROBERT D.

After an hour, he found the Pendleton\u2019s stern. Mr. Fitzgerald, manning the searchlight, picked out the shattered walls, shredded wires and dangling plates of a half-ship. It lurched dangerously, and the lifeboat made a cautious approach, Capt. W. Russell Webster said in an official Coast Guard account.\n\n\u2018Cacophony of Eerie Groans\u2019\n\n\u201cThe searchlight soon revealed a pitch black mass of twisted metal, which heaved high in the air upon the massive waves and then settled back down in a frothing mass of foam,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEach movement of the giant hulk produced a cacophony of eerie groans as the broken ship twisted and strained in the 60-foot seas. No lights were apparent as coxswain Webber maneuvered the small boat aft along the port side of the Pendleton\u2019s stern section.\u201d\n\nThe enormous stern and the tiny lifeboat fell into an ungainly dance, rising and falling in tandem, then drawing apart to soar and plunge randomly. As the lifeboat rounded the stern, its searchlight caught the name Pendleton. Lights on the starboard deck high overhead suddenly glowed. A man frantically waving his arms appeared and disappeared. Seamen in orange life jackets then lined up along the starboard rail, shouting unintelligibly down into the wind and crashing seas.\n\nThe lifeboat crew had no idea how to get the stranded men off. Suddenly, a Jacob\u2019s ladder, a seamen\u2019s device of ropes and wood slats, was thrown over the rail and unrolled down the hull. Seamen climbed onto the wildly swinging ladder and began to descend. The first to reach bottom leapt onto the lifeboat\u2019s bow and was pulled in by the crew as Mr. Webber struggled to hold his boat steady.\n\nA line of descending men overhead clung to the rope ladder as it swayed perilously out and slammed back into the hull. With every roll of the stern, Mr. Webber tried to maneuver his boat close to let another seaman leap aboard. It was not always possible. Many fell into the freezing sea but struggled to the surface and grabbed a safety line rigged around the lifeboat\u2019s shell."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "MELISSA CLARK", "title": "Melissa Clark\u2019s Menu for Your Best Thanksgiving Yet", "description": "Melissa Clark\u2019s childhood Thanksgivings included her father\u2019s quest to make the perfect turkey.

And now, they want to direct the nation\u2019s talent and tech acumen toward an even loftier end: building an innovation-driven economy, one that produces world-leading companies.\n\nNot long ago, Chinese tech firms were best known for copying Silicon Valley.\n\nGoogle Baidu YouTube Youku Instagram Douyin Uber Didi\n\nBut the flow of inspiration now runs both ways. American social media executives look to Tencent and ByteDance for the latest tricks for keeping users glued to their phones.\n\nTencent\u2019s WeChat app, an all-in-one hub for socializing, playing games, paying bills, booking train tickets and more, paved the way for the increasingly feature-stuffed chat apps made by Facebook and Apple. Facebook recently took a page from TikTok, a Chinese service that is a sensation among Western tweens, by releasing its own highly similar app for creating goofy short videos.\n\nIf people in the West didn\u2019t see this coming, it was because they mistook China\u2019s authoritarianism for hostility toward technology.\n\nBut in some ways Chinese tech firms are less fettered than American ones. Witness the backlash against Big Data in the United States, the calls to break up giants like Facebook and the anxiety about digital addiction. None of those are big problems for Chinese companies.\n\nIn China, there is pretty much only one rule, and it is simple: Don\u2019t undermine the state.\n\nSo titans like Weibo and Baidu heed censorship orders. Unwanted beliefs and ideologies are kept out.\n\nBeyond that, everything is fair game. Start-ups can achieve mammoth scale with astonishing speed; they can also crash brutally. Thanks to weak intellectual property protections, they can rip one another off with abandon \u2014 not great for rewarding innovation, but O.K. for consumers, who get lots of choices.\n\nAnd the money just keeps flowing in.\n\n$25 billion United States 20 15 China 10 5 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 \u201918 $25 billion United States 20 15 China 10 5 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 $25 billion United States 20 15 China 10 5 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 \u201918 Venture capital invested each quarter.

That has allowed internet champions like Alibaba and Tencent to sew themselves into these businesses with ease.\n\nWith their mobile payment platforms, the two giants have built sprawling ecosystems in which vast amounts of commercial activity now take place. Little remains of daily life that has not been transformed. Shopping. Getting a loan. Renting a bike. Even going to the doctor.\n\nThis level of clout hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by China\u2019s leaders. Never in the Communist era have private entities wielded such influence over people\u2019s lives.\n\nTo keep tech in its place, the government is demanding stakes in companies and influence over management. Regulators have reprimanded online platforms for hosting content they deem distasteful \u2014 too raunchy, too flirty, too creepy or just too weird.\n\nThat\u2019s why the best way for tech companies to thrive in China is to make themselves useful to the state. Nearly everyone in China uses WeChat, making the social network a great way for the authorities to police what people say and do.

Different perspectives collide and breed tension, even within households. In this cross section of humanity, few things are considered too bizarre to be off limits, and the mundane parts of daily life can intersect with the insane.\n\nCase in point: A friend told me about her colleague, whose family was living with a rooster as their pet in a tiny apartment in the heart of the city. Even by Mumbai standards, it seemed absurd. I had to find out more.\n\nI grew up in a city, in a meat-eating family, where we ate chicken at least three times a week. For us, chickens were food. But for the family I profile in this documentary, it was more complicated. The father grew up in a village where they raised the chickens they slaughtered and ate, and his children grew up more like me. Each of their unflinching pragmatism toward their new roommate drew me in. Who would have thought that the chicken, a staple food for the millions of households and restaurants in a country of a billion people, could become an agonizing inconvenience for an ordinary family in this city. And yet, problematic as his presence was, he became part of their household, as a pet.\n\nThis is less a story about a chicken than it is about the people around him, because we use animals as reflections of human consciousness. We see that play out in this film; through their pet chicken, each family member must probe the nature of affection, loyalty and even the ethics of eating another creature. When it comes to animals, where do we draw the line between food and family? Can you eat your own pet?

The court culture of the Heian era, which ran from the eighth through the 12th centuries, was one in which other Chinese developments \u2014 notably, bureaucracy \u2014 stimulated the demand for paper for record-keeping and bookmaking. As the importance of the court declined, and the feudal, polycentric system of warrior potentates rose, so too did the manufacture of paper decentralize and proliferate. It was at this point that paper began to be used in architecture, for sliding doors and screens, and so the need for more, and longer-lasting, variations became imperative. This is how washi-making became a household tradition: By the 1800s, when capitalist industrial techniques were introduced, over 100,000 ordinary families were known to be making their own paper by hand for various domestic uses. But those same hyper-exploitative industrial techniques \u2014 including the mass production of cement and, a little later, warships \u2014 would gradually put an end to this era.\n\nToday, though, the remnants of these traditions can be seen in the Modernist buildings that still stand in major cities, including Tokyo\u2019s International House of Japan, one of the country\u2019s most famous hotels, designed in 1952 by Japanese acolytes of Le Corbusier, which makes use of shoji screens. The architectural roots of paper are even clearer in more recent works by Shigeru Ban, whose emergency shelters following the 2011 Fukushima earthquake were made mostly of paper \u2014 in particular, recycled cardboard tubes \u2014 or by Kengo Kuma, whose buildings continuously riff on Japanese craftsmanship.\n\nTokyo itself remains a paradise of art and manga and stationery stores \u2014 all monuments to a persistent if perhaps anachronistic print culture. At one of these stores, Ozu Washi, which has occupied the same location in the Nihonbashi business district since 1653, I learned how washi is made. Washi is one of the strongest papers in the world, and to produce it, one has to cultivate the kozo, a shrublike tree that is related to the mulberry (gampi and mitsumata trees are also used). Unlike with Western-style paper, the bark of the tree is crushed and retained in the production. The resulting fibers must be beaten and bleached and mixed with water and neri, a slime that comes from the roots of the Tororo-aoi. This mix is then layered over a screen, at which point colors can be added and the thickness of the paper augmented with more layers. At the end, the pulp is pressed and dried. The result is paper that is difficult to tear, palely lucent and incredibly durable. Bright patterning \u2014 of natural flora or geometric trompe l\u2019oeil effects \u2014 is often woodblock-printed on it, or watermarks are threaded in, on pages lined vertically for calligraphy. The product is more than just a surface on which to transmit thoughts or ideas; it is a sculptural, tactile object, and its very physical presence helps account for its endurance. Paper, then, is not just a vehicle for text or images but an object unto itself \u2014 not something to be merely experienced by sight, it demands to be touched as well. Washi is more like an active metaphor for Japanese craft writ large \u2014 luxurious, laborious, useful and maintaining a rough-edged, pastoral simplicity.\n\nTHE GREAT PARADOX of Japan\u2019s paper culture is that the country was also one of the earliest producers of global technology, particularly with the founding in 1946 of Sony (originally called the Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corp.), a company that could reasonably claim the mantle as one of the original tech supergiants. Having once been a papermaking innovator, the country also became the site of other crucial advancements. The first consumer tape recorders and transistor radios emerged here in the 1950s, and in 1966, the Sony Building in Ginza, Tokyo\u2019s old business district, further transformed the look of the modern city by becoming the first example of \u201cmedia architecture,\u201d with a facade that displayed video images, a development for screens that was perhaps inevitable in a country that pioneered this technology back when it was still analog."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": null, "title": "letter: Grueling Schedules and the Pursuit of Happiness", "description": "A reader recalls her father\u2019s insight.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/opinion/letters/grueling-schedules.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/business/06NEWWORLDprint/merlin_143227311_5d10f4e5-87c8-4207-8ea1-5f6101d6c6c1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:27:25Z", "content": "To the Editor: Re The New New World (Business Day, Nov. 6): Reading about the punishing work schedules of Chinese technology executives reminded me of how, during my 1950s Brooklyn childhood, my father, a high school French teacher as well as an immigrant fro\u2026 [+281 chars]", "fulltext": "To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cThe New New World\u201d (Business Day, Nov. 6):\n\nReading about the \u201cpunishing work schedules\u201d of Chinese technology executives reminded me of how, during my 1950s Brooklyn childhood, my father, a high school French teacher as well as an immigrant from Eastern Europe, regaled me with descriptions of the grueling amount of homework French children my age were expected to do.\n\nHe added that American children were spared this dire fate because \u201cwe Americans believe in the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\n\nFelicia Nimue Ackerman\n\nProvidence, R.I."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "BROOKS BARNES", "title": "Disney Wins Chinese Approval for Fox Deal, Clearing Major Hurdle", "description": "Disney\u2019s takeover of most of 21st Century Fox was initially expected to be completed by June 2019 but Robert A.

Except for these passages, everything we\u2019ll learn about him arrives obliquely and in fragments, stories told to that invisible narrator by seven invented characters. Ranging from an Army intelligence officer tailing Oppenheimer in 1943, to a journalist assigned to write a last profile of the dying physicist in 1966, these characters are insinuated into the world of Oppenheimer\u2019s real-life friends, family and colleagues, playing roles (secretary, old friend, curious neighbor) similar to their historical analogues. This is not in itself an unusual strategy: Think of all the historical fiction involving the great man\u2019s butler, the queen\u2019s housekeeper, the overlooked minor bystander speaking at last. But these figures seem designed, in a way I haven\u2019t seen before, to mirror the ambiguous tensions of Oppenheimer\u2019s personality.\n\nThey lie, as Oppenheimer famously did during the many investigations preceding his horrifying 1954 security hearing. They have secrets, as Oppenheimer did, and are deeply conflicted about the necessity of keeping them.

He noted that Florida had recently experienced extreme drought, record high temperatures and wildfires \u2014 and also Hurricane Michael, the powerful Category 4 storm that slammed into the Panhandle last month. Similarly, California is suffering through the worst wildfires the state has ever seen, as well as drought, extreme heat waves and degraded air quality that threatens the health of residents.\n\nThings will get worse, the authors wrote. The paper projects future trends and suggests that, by 2100, unless humanity takes forceful action to curb the greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change, some tropical coastal areas of the planet, like the Atlantic coast of South and Central America, could be hit by as many as six crises at a time."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "CLARA FERREIRA-MARQUES", "title": "Breakingviews: Consolidation Might Solve Some of Asia\u2019s Big Airline Issues", "description": "Too many carriers, with too many planes, offering cheap fares have left the industry on its knees.

Of course it isn\u2019t as a literary figure that he\u2019s most remembered, but rather as a screenwriter, best known for \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d and \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d He was also a wily truth-teller about the ways of Hollywood, the author of many memorable lines in and about movies.

Moore was assigned female at birth and was raised as a girl. \u201cShe said one of the reasons she was breaking up with me is because she wanted to be with a woman,\u201d Moore told me. The exchange was deeply emotional. \u201cShe could barely finish the sentence.\u201d The observation clarified a feeling that had been nagging at Moore, who was 30 at the time. \u201cI always felt that I have a boy inside me who needs to share space with this woman-facing identity,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know how to bring that to the surface.\u201d\n\nShortly after that conversation, Moore said, \u201cI started exploring my gender variants and what they meant.\u201d At first, Moore considered transitioning genders. Moore researched hormone therapy and surgery, but something about that didn\u2019t feel quite right. \u201cI realized that wasn\u2019t me, either,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI came to this understanding for myself that gender was projected onto my body, and I don\u2019t need to alter my body to affirm my gender or align with one gender or another.\u201d\n\nAt that time, around 2013, Moore, who is black, was living in Tucson and had few friends of color \u2014 and even fewer who were gender-nonconforming. But Moore worked in the African-American student-affairs office at the University of Arizona and often attended conferences focused on social justice and organizing, where many of the participants and attendees embodied the gender spectrum. It was the first time Moore was surrounded by nonbinary people. Gender-neutral pronouns like \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d were much more common in these spaces. By the summer of 2014, Moore began using them, too, and going by their middle name, Matice, which felt more androgynous than their birth name, Maria. Moore continued to interact with people from the conferences on Facebook and other forms of social media using the new name and pronouns. Online, Moore said, \u201cI felt the availability to identify in that way.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, Moore became aware of a performance-and-poetry group (now disbanded) called Dark Matter. Moore became transfixed by videos of one of its members, Alok Vaid-Menon, who was able to eloquently dismiss conventional notions of gender, particularly the idea that there are only two. Seeing people like Vaid-Menon online gave Moore the courage to reconsider how they approached gender. Moore began experimenting with their outward appearance. Before Moore changed the pronoun they used, Moore had favored a more masculine, dandy-like aesthetic \u2014 close-cropped hair, button-down shirts and bow ties \u2014 in large part to fit in at work. Moore began wearing their hair longer and often chose less gender-specific clothing, like T-shirts or boxy tops, which felt more natural and comfortable to them. Vaid-Menon\u2019s assuredness, Moore said, \u201cboosted my confidence in terms of defining and asserting my own identity in public spaces.\u201d\n\nA shift in technology emboldened Moore, too. In 2014, Facebook updated its site to include nonbinary gender identities and pronouns, adding more than 50 options for users who don\u2019t identify as male or female, including agender, gender-questioning and intersex. It was a profound moment for Moore. \u201cThey had options I didn\u2019t even know about,\u201d Moore told me. That summer, Moore selected \u201cnonbinary,\u201d alerting their wider social spheres, including childhood friends and family members who also used the site. For Moore, it saved them some of the energy of having to explain their name and pronoun shift. Moore also clarified their gender pronouns on Instagram. \u201cI wrote it into my profile to make it more explicit.\u201d To some, the act might seem small, but for Moore, their identity \u201cfelt crystallized, and important.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor many gender-nonconforming people, bullying is an everyday experience,\u201d says Alok Vaid-Menon , 27. \u201cand we don\u2019t have the luxury of growing up from it or moving away from it.\u201d Photograph from the subject.\n\nSeveral societies and cultures understand gender as more varied than just man or woman, but in the United States, a gender binary has been the norm. \u201cIn our cultural history, we\u2019ve never had anything close to a third category, or even the notion that you could be in between categories,\u201d said Barbara Risman, a sociology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Risman, who recently published a book called \u201cWhere the Millennials Will Take Us: A New Generation Wrestles With the Gender Structure,\u201d contrasted her early research with what she is seeing now. Few of the people she interviewed for the book in 2012 and 2013 were openly using nongendered pronouns, if they even knew about them. Just four years later, she began researching nonbinary young adults because the landscape had changed so radically. \u201cIt was reflexive with their friends at school, social groups. Many colleges classes start out with \u2018Name, major and preferred pronouns,\u2019 \u201d Risman told me. In Risman\u2019s experience, it used to take decades to introduce new ideas about sex, sexuality or gender, and even longer for them to trickle upstream into society. \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating is how quickly the public conversation has led to legal changes,\u201d Risman said. California and Washington, among others, now allow people to select \u201cx\u201d as their gender, instead of \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale,\u201d on identity documents. \u201cAnd I am convinced that it has to do with \u2014 like everything else in society \u2014 the rapid flow of information.\u201d\n\nHelana Darwin, a sociologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook who began researching nonbinary identities in 2014, found that the social-media community played an unparalleled role in people\u2019s lives, especially those who were geographically isolated from other nonbinary people. \u201cEither they were very confused about what was going on or just feeling crushingly lonely and without support, and their online community was the only support in their lives,\u201d Darwin told me. \u201cThey turned to the site to understand they aren\u2019t alone.\u201d Most of her subjects said social media was instrumental in deepening their understanding of their identities. \u201cA 61-year-old person in my sample told me that they lived the vast majority of their life as though they were a gay man and was mistaken often as a drag queen after coming out. They didn\u2019t discover nonbinary until they were in their 50s, and it was a freeing moment of understanding that nothing is wrong. They didn\u2019t have to force themselves into the gay-man or trans-woman box \u2014 they could just be them. They described it as transcendent.\u201d\n\nWhen Darwin began her study four years ago, she was shocked to discover that the body of research on nonbinary people was nearly nonexistent. \u201cEven as nonbinary people are becoming increasing visible and vocal, there were still only a handful of articles published in the field of sociology that were even tangentially about nonbinary people and even fewer that were explicitly about nonbinary people.\u201d What little research there was tended to lump the nonbinary experience into trans-woman and trans-man experience, even though all signs pointed to deep differences. The void in the field, she thinks, was due to society\u2019s reliance on the notion that all humans engage in some sense of gender-based identity performance, which reaffirms the idea that gender exists. \u201cThere was an academic lag that isn\u2019t keeping with the very urgent and exponentially profound gender revolution happening in our culture.\u201d\n\nHer research found that social media is a gathering place for discussing the logistics of gender \u2014 providing advice, reassurance and emotional support, as well as soliciting feedback about everything from voice modulation to hairstyles. The internet is a place where nonbinary people can learn about mixing masculine and feminine elements to the point of obscuring concrete identification as either. As one person she interviewed put it, \u201cEvery day someone can\u2019t tell what I am is a good day.\u201d\n\nNearly everyone Darwin interviewed remarked about the power of acquiring language that spoke to their identity, and they tended to find that language on the internet. But Harry Barbee, a nonbinary sociologist at Florida State University who studies sex, gender and sexuality, cautioned against treating social media as a curative. \u201cWhen the world assumes you don\u2019t exist, you\u2019re forced to define yourself into existence if you want some semblance of recognition and social viability, and so the internet and social media helps achieve this,\u201d Barbee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a dream world where we are free to be you and me, because it can also be a mechanism for social control.\u201d Barbee has been researching what it means to live as nonbinary in a binary world. Social media, Barbee said, is \u201cone realm where they do feel free to share who they are, but they\u2019re realistic about the limitations of the space. Even online, they are confronted by hostility and people who are telling them they\u2019re just confused or that makes no sense, or want to talk to them about their genitals.\u201d\n\nMatice Moore @mariamatice Photograph from the subject.

As a child, they visited doctors, multiple times. Those visits were followed by unexplained surgeries. \u201cI was growing breasts, and it was confusing,\u201d Turner told me. \u201cI felt so alone, because I didn\u2019t have any friends experiencing similar things.\u201d\n\nIntersex people don\u2019t fit neatly into a binary, in part, Turner told me, because their bodies are neither. Turner turned to the internet and came across the YouTube videos and writings of Pidgeon Pagonis, a dark-haired, charismatic intersex activist who lives in Chicago and is strikingly honest about the involuntary procedures they endured. It was the first time Turner understood what happened to them as a child.\n\nPagonis identifies as nonbinary, and the word resonated with Turner. Not long after that, Turner began searching for other nonbinary people online and found Rain Dove, a gorgeous gender-nonconforming model with an awe-inspiring jawline who proudly represents their fluidity. \u201cI\u2019ve known this was an identity before I had language for it,\u201d Turner told me. \u201cOnce I heard it, I was like, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s me.\u2019 \u201d Turner no longer felt a need to fit into other people\u2019s expectations of gender. Turner let their hair grow out to frame their soft eyes and full lips. Their Instagram posts often feature them posing in oversize T-shirts amid soft lighting. Under the banner of nonbinary, Turner told me, \u201cI can be fat; I can be thin. I can be feminine, and I can be masculine.\u201d\n\nTurner, who is black, pointed out that mainstream gender-nonconforming narratives tend to privilege white upper-class bodies. One of the most obvious examples is Taylor Mason, a nonbinary character on the Showtime drama \u201cBillions,\u201d played by the nonbinary actor Asia Kate Dillon. \u201cThe people who usually get lifted up are skinny, white and femme, as if that\u2019s the only face of people who are nonbinary, and it\u2019s very far from it,\u201d Turner said. Online, the faces can be far more varied, especially through hashtags like #NonbinaryIsntWhite, a movement on Twitter and Instagram, where people who identify as nonbinary post selfies. The result has been a kaleidoscopic board of inspiration for a multitude of gender and racial expressions, with wildly varying styles of dress, makeup and settings. To scroll through the images is to understand that there is no one way to be nonbinary. The entire point underscores the idea that there is no status quo, no \u201cnormal\u201d and no need to limit yourself based on a societal ideal. One post from a person using the handle SevaQuinn shows themselves in a black button-down with a flower in their hair and the caption, \u201cMy ethnicity is about as mixed as my gender.\u201d Another person posting under the handle AfroAutPunk shows themselves wearing a Prince shirt, headphones and lipstick, with the caption, \u201cBlack, fat, disabled, nonbinary, queer and intersex.\u201d\n\nPsychologists often posit that as children, we operate almost like scientists, experimenting and gathering information to make sense of our surroundings. Children use their available resources \u2014 generally limited to their immediate environment \u2014 to gather cues, including information about gender roles, to create a sense of self. Alison Gopnik, a renowned philosopher and child psychologist, told me that it\u2019s not enough to simply tell children that other identities or ways of being exist. \u201cThat still won\u2019t necessarily change their perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to see it.\u201d\n\n\u201ci\u2019ve known this was an identity before I had a language for it,\u201d says Ahomari Turner, 27. \u201cOnce I heard it, I was like, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s me.\u2019\u201d Photograph from the subject.\n\nIn her 2009 book, \u201cThe Philosophical Baby,\u201d Gopnik writes that \u201cwhen we travel, we return to the wide-ranging curiosity of childhood, and we discover new things about ourselves.\u201d In a new geographic area, our attention is heightened, and everything, from differently labeled condiments to streetwear, becomes riveting. \u201cThis new knowledge lets us imagine new ways that we could live ourselves,\u201d she asserts. Flying over feeds in social media can feel like viewing portholes into new dimensions and realities, so I asked Gopnick if it\u2019s possible that social media can function as a foreign country, where millions of new ideas and identities and habitats are on display \u2014 and whether that exposure can pry our calcified minds open in unexpected ways. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a wider range of possibilities to look at gives people a sense of a wider range of possibilities, and those different experiences might lead to having different identities.\u201d\n\nWhen we dive into Instagram or Facebook, we are on exploratory missions, processing large volumes of information that help us shape our understanding of ourselves and one another. And this is a country that a majority of young adults are visiting on a regular basis. A Pew study from this year found that some 88 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds report using some form of social media, and 71 percent of Americans between ages 18 and 24 use Instagram. Social media is perhaps the most influential form of media they now have. They turn to it for the profound and the mundane \u2014 to shape their views and their aesthetics. Social media is a testing ground for expression, the locus of experimentation and exploration \u2014 particularly for those who cannot yet fully inhabit themselves offline for fear of discrimination, or worse. Because of that, it has become a lifeline for many people struggling to find others just like them.\n\nDennis Norris II @dennisearlii Photograph from the subject.

Vaid-Menon, who is 27, grew up moving between two worlds in College Station, Tex., a small town about an hour outside Houston. \u201cThere was an unwelcome mat at every door,\u201d Vaid-Menon told me. At home, Vaid-Menon was part of a tight-knit Indian community, while at school, Vaid-Menon\u2019s world was predominantly white and evangelical. Bullying and racism were de rigueur there. As a young child, Vaid-Menon spent hours online on Myspace and Xanga \u2014 a blog-based social network popular in the early 2000s \u2014 sharing journal entries and poetry that were mostly about \u201cexistential loneliness.\u201d Through those interactions, Vaid-Menon met people who praised the young teenager on the beauty of their words and creativity. Vaid-Menon began to thrive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever saw anyone who looked like me, ever, even online,\u201d Vaid-Menon said, before adding with a laugh, \u201cuntil maybe Joanne the Scammer,\u201d referring to the online persona of a mischievous woman in a ratty fur coat and an even rattier blond wig, portrayed by Branden Miller. But online friends, whom Vaid-Menon described affectionately as a \u201cragtag group,\u201d were among the first to affirm the feelings and uncertainty Vaid-Menon was experiencing. There was a collective sense that everyone could share stories that were forbidden in their offline lives. \u201cSeeing visible queer people online and seeing people be vulnerable \u2014 all of that created me.\u201d In the beginning, Vaid-Menon was just trying to meet peers and get information about queer and trans identities, with the hope of finding clarity on their own feelings. \u201cBut then I started getting messages from random people in, like, Arkansas, and that taught me that strangers can be people we feel more close to than our blood family,\u201d Vaid-Menon said. \u201cThat paradox is what I do with my social media today.\u201d\n\nVaid-Menon is extremely active on Instagram, uploading daily stories and posts for their 146,000 followers. Scrolling through their page reveals an inspired bouquet of multicolored and multipatterned outfits, lips coated in blues, pinks or purples. They are constantly playing around with their presentation, seamlessly blending together suits, thigh-high boots, dresses, sweaters, hair colors, makeup, footwear and accessories to create a look that truly feels beyond any known understanding of masculine or feminine \u2014 which is exactly the point. Many of Vaid-Menon\u2019s posts feature a confident and smiling Vaid-Menon at performances or speaking engagements, often posing with trans, nonbinary and gender-nonconforming friends, including the Canadian artist Vivek Shraya, the Brazilian singer Liniker and the Stonewall activist Miss Major.\n\nTo the average scroller, the photos themselves give the impression of a celebratory postgender, postracial world. But reading the accompanying text more often than not reveals a life marked by anxiety, trauma and fear. One such post features Vaid-Menon against a pink backdrop in a striped, sequined two-piece dress. Pouting aqua lips and yellow-lidded eyes are framed by cascading curls. The entire effect is of a futuristic pinup. The text reads: \u201cIn the last year that i posted this I still receive daily hate mail from people of all genders telling me that my body hair is ugly & that I need to shave to be more \u2018real\u2019 & \u2018beautiful.\u2019 So i figured i would repost because people still don\u2019t get it! Body hair has no gender! Facial hair has no gender!\u201d Another post shows a beaming Vaid-Menon posing in front of a stone wall, wearing a marigold-yellow button-down embroidered with flowers and neon patchwork shorts that meet patent-leather boots \u2014 one hot pink, the other lime green. Vaid-Menon\u2019s blue-tinged hair is pulled into a side ponytail that flirts with bright orange pom-pom earrings. The caption reads: \u201cthe worst thing just happened!! i was trapped underground in the subway for an hour because of a train malfunction. I was dressed feminine & one of my worst fears is getting on trains & being trapped with people harassing me \u2014 you can\u2019t escape & no one defends you :/ i had to really focus on my breath & it took everything in me not to have a full blown panic attack!\u201d\n\nAlthough social media generally conditions users to share only their highlights \u2014 the success reel of their lives \u2014 Vaid-Menon thinks it\u2019s important to share the reality of living in a gender-nonconforming body; they want people to understand what the daily experience can be like. \u201cThe majority of nonbinary, gender-nonconforming cannot manifest themselves because to do so would mean violence, death, harassment and punishment,\u201d Vaid-Menon told me. But Vaid-Menon believes that more people will respond to the vulnerability Vaid-Menon expresses; it\u2019s something they learned as a young gender-questioning person growing up in a small Republican town. \u201cIt taught me that people do not have to understand in order to care, because people cared about me outside of my gender and perceptions.\u201d\n\nVaid-Menon is a gifted public speaker and lecturer and uses Instagram like an open-source pulpit, drawing from their academic background and knowledge of South Asian gender systems to challenge heteronormativity and the treatment of marginalized people. If being vulnerable is one way Vaid-Menon tries to reach people, being outspoken about gender is another. In one recent Instagram Live video, hours after the news broke that the Trump administration planned to sign an executive order that would narrow the definition of gender to an immutable, biological condition, limiting protections for transgender people under federal civil rights law, Vaid-Menon sits wearing an olive green jacket and a topknot dyed to match and delivers a searing lecture about the widely adopted binary notions of sex and gender. \u201cThere is a gender-sex distinction that has been normalized even in progressive movements,\u201d Vaid-Menon begins. \u201cThere\u2019s an idea that gender is a cultural attribute, expressed by fashion and outfits, whereas the body has to do with sex. There\u2019s a series of binaries that are created here.\u201d Vaid-Menon warms up as the talk continues, speaking in a cadence that is accelerating and tinged with anger. \u201cWhy is it that when trans people take hormones, it\u2019s seen as body modification, and if cis people take hormones for, like, a medical condition, it\u2019s not seen as body modification? That\u2019s where transphobia lives. The body is mutable. Sex is mutable. Sex is not a \u2018biological essential category.\u2019 We allow gender to be nonconforming while we stabilize sex.\u201d\n\nPersonally, Vaid-Menon doesn\u2019t identify as any gender. \u201cNonbinary is so oxymoronic,\u201d Vaid-Menon told me. \u201cWe\u2019re defining ourselves by an absence and not our abundance.\u201d When pressed, they will describe themselves as transfeminine, gender-nonconforming and nonbinary \u2014 but only reluctantly. \u201cI really try to escape having to put myself in these categories,\u201d Vaid-Menon said. \u201cI wanted to be free from boxes \u2014 not end up in a new one.\u201d Social media is one of the few outlets for that uninhibited expression.\n\nVaid-Menon views social media as strategic, and as a practice to push everyone to rethink their conception of gender. \u201cTechnology is not an obstacle to intimacy \u2014 it is a conduit for it, and it expands our capacity for it,\u201d Vaid-Menon told me. It offers a way to express emotions that are often repressed in person, especially for people who don\u2019t fit into mainstream perceptions of gender. \u201cIt\u2019s a type of intimacy we don\u2019t even get in person.\u201d\n\nHashtags and profiles are influencing an entire generation of people who now often develop their sense of selves online. As Turner told me, \u201cPeople are finding ways to articulate how they feel about themselves, and that\u2019s what happened to me too.\u201d/\u2022/"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ISABEL KERSHNER", "title": "Netanyahu\u2019s Coalition in Israel Survives, for Now", "description": "In a sharp turnaround, two hawkish ministers decided not to resign over the government\u2019s handling of the latest conflict in Gaza, staving off elections.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/world/middleeast/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-naftali-bennett.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/20/world/20Israel-Bennett1/20Israel-Bennett1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:38:01Z", "content": "After Mr. Lieberman quit, the education minister, Mr. Bennett, demanded that he be named defense minister; he was rebuffed by the prime minister on Friday.

People in poverty live at or below $1.90 a day.\n\nNot only are incomes drastically rising within families, but sons are outearning their fathers. That means expectations are rising, too, especially among China\u2019s growing middle class.\n\nLife expectancy has also soared. Chinese men born in 2013 are expected to live more than seven years longer than those born in 1990; women are expected to live nearly 10 years longer.\n\n\u201cIt feels like there are no limits to how far you can go,\u201d said Wu Haifeng, 37, a financial analyst who was born to a family of corn farmers in northern China and now earns more than $78,000 a year. \u201cIt feels like China will always be strong.\u201d\n\nChina used to make up much of the world\u2019s poor. Now it makes up much of the world\u2019s middle class. Source: World Inequality Database\n\nThere are risks, of course, and no guarantees that China\u2019s rise will continue indefinitely.\n\nA prolonged economic slump could inflict major damage. And experts warn that China could fall into the middle-income trap \u2014 in which growth and earnings plateau \u2014 if it fails to address high corporate debt levels or doesn\u2019t do more to encourage innovation. Demography is also a ticking bomb: China is racing to get rich before it gets old.\n\nYet for now, the economic arc seems ever upward.\n\nLike the United States, China still has a yawning gap between the rich and the poor \u2014 and the poorest Chinese are far poorer, with nearly 500 million people, or about 40 percent of the population, living on less than $5.50 a day, according to the World Bank.\n\nBut by some measures Chinese society has about the same level of inequality as the United States. Here are the world\u2019s major countries ordered by inequality and income mobility. Finland More mobile Denmark 20% Norway Germany Canada How much a child\u2019s income is determined by their parents\u2019 Sweden Netherlands Japan 40% Spain China Italy United Kingdom United States 60% Brazil South Africa India 80% Egypt More equal 60 50 40 30 100% Level of inequality (Gini coefficient) Finland More mobile Norway 20% How much a child\u2019s income is determined by their parents\u2019 Sweden Japan China 40% United States 60% South Africa India 80% circles scaled by population More Equal Egypt 60 50 40 30 Level of inequality (Gini) Source: The World Bank, Fair Progress, Economic Mobility Across Generations Around the World ; World Development Indicators\n\nToday, the economic output per capita in China is $12,000, compared with $3,500 a decade ago. The number is far higher in the United States, $53,000.\n\nYet few analysts doubt where the bigger increases will come. Here\u2019s how modern China\u2019s per-capita G.D.P. growth compares so far: United States $50k per capita G.D.P. $40k Japan South Korea $30k $20k China $10k 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Number of years since each country reached China\u2019s per-capita G.D.P. in 1993 United States $50k per capita G.D.P. $40k South Korea Japan $30k $20k China $10k 0 40 80 120 160 Number of years since each country reached China\u2019s per-capita G.D.P. in 1993 In 2011 U.S. dollars. | Source: Maddison Project.\n\nChina\u2019s progress is especially remarkable given how the government has used social engineering to restrict where people live and how many children they have. Loosening those constraints could accelerate income growth.\n\nThis is why many people now talk about \u201cthe Chinese Dream.\u201d\n\nXu Liya, 49, once tilled wheat fields in Zhejiang, a rural province along China\u2019s east coast. Her family ate meat only once a week, and each night she crammed into a bedroom with seven relatives.\n\nThen she attended university on a scholarship and started a clothing store. Now she owns two cars and an apartment valued at more than $300,000. Her daughter attends college in Beijing.\n\n\u201cPoverty and corruption have hurt average people in China for too long,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile today\u2019s society isn\u2019t perfect, poor people have the resources to compete with rich people, too.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "Robert Cyran", "title": "The Chip Industry Can\u2019t Seem to Escape Its Boom-and-Bust Past", "description": "As new fields demanded huge computing power, top chip manufacturers seemed invulnerable.

At the same time, chip demand continued to rise. Profits boomed, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose sixfold over the past decade.\n\nOne of the hottest areas has been graphics processors. In addition to making games more realistic, these chips are useful for machine learning, self-driving cars and mining cryptocurrencies.

They often dined at Del Pezzo\u2019s, an Italian restaurant on 34th Street, and played the card game scopa in the back. Caruso tended to win until, legend has it, the other players had a mirror placed behind his chair.\n\nIt was during that first trip to New York that Puccini attended one of the most notorious performances in opera history: the American premiere of Richard Strauss\u2019s \u201cSalome.\u201d\n\nHe liked it. Before the premiere, in a wide-ranging interview with The Times in his suite at the Hotel Astor \u2014 which was interrupted at one point by a bellboy carrying a card mistakenly addressed to \u201cMr. Rossini\u201d \u2014 Puccini proclaimed that \u201cSalome\u201d was the greatest modern opera.\n\nBased on Oscar Wilde\u2019s play of lust, violence and religion, the opera shocked conservative Met patrons with its dance of the seven veils and its heroine\u2019s climactic kiss of John the Baptist\u2019s severed head. Under pressure from its board, the Met canceled the rest of its run and did not perform \u201cSalome\u201d again until 1934. The episode left a mark on Puccini.\n\nA few months later, when he decided to abandon an opera he had been considering, \u201cConchita,\u201d based on a psychosexual drama by Pierre Lou\u00ffs, Puccini wrote to his disappointed publishers, insisting he had not been influenced by the debacle. \u201cIt was not fear (confound the word!) of the prudery of the Anglo-Saxon audiences of Europe and America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not the example of \u2018Salome\u2019 in New York.\u201d\n\nBy the time this trip ended he was ready to go home.

In interviews, she has audaciously declared herself to be a \u201cmaster legislator\u201d; issued policy statements on behalf of the Democratic caucus; and implicitly dared any challenger to make themselves known while also quelling opposition to her speakership by hinting in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in October that she was open to being a \u201ctransitional figure.\u201d When I asked Pelosi about this olive branch two weeks later, however, she abruptly walked it back: \u201cI think every leader is a transitional figure.\u201d\n\nHer torrid October schedule, spanning more than two dozen cities, involved meeting with candidates whose victories on Nov. 6 were mostly all but assured, while taking care to avoid hotly contested races where the presence of one of the least popular and most reliably demonized figures in American politics might cost a Democrat votes. Pelosi had spent the previous day in Arizona, rallying volunteers and donors on behalf of Ann Kirkpatrick \u2014 a candidate who, then seven points ahead of her Republican opponent in internal polls, didn\u2019t really need Pelosi\u2019s help.

But to the extent that it\u2019s possible, she\u2019s the one who would have the best chance. If Trump plays that game of agreeing to something and then backing off, she has the talent to unify her caucus so that they have a unified message to take to the American people \u2014 because in cases like that, only the American people can set matters straight.\u201d\n\nPelosi is something of a paradox in the world of politics. A Gallup poll five months ago found her favorability rating to be at a dismal 29 percent, and yet \u2014 unlike other unpopular political figures such as Trump and Hillary Clinton \u2014 her 31 years in public life have been free of scandal. She has been excoriated from the right as the quintessence of California limousine liberalism. But she is also a practicing Catholic whose first career was as a stay-at-home mother of five children, with little in common with \u2014 and at times little patience for \u2014 the new generation of activists in her party, to whom she sometimes refers as \u201cthe lefties.\u201d Pelosi \u2014 who with her husband, the investor Paul Pelosi, owns a large house in San Francisco\u2019s upper-crust Presidio Heights as well as a Napa Valley vineyard \u2014 is indeed rich. But 29 members of Congress, 18 of them Republicans, are richer.\n\nWhat sets her apart from other legislators of her stature is her gender. Pelosi has been known to say: \u201cNo one gives you power. You have to take it from them.\u201d The leitmotif of her three-decade ascent is that of a woman wresting power away from a male-dominated political machine, until one day the machine discovered she was its master."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ROBERT SIMONSON", "title": "Six Places in Buenos Aires Where You\u2019ll Want to Have a Drink", "description": "The locals, known as porte\u00f1os, take their drinking traditions \u2014 and the amazing variety of places where they can indulge them \u2014 very seriously.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/travel/six-best-cocktail-bars-buenos-aires.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/travel/25bacocktails-01/merlin_146398356_65542166-fd7a-4dae-b95e-b6461d30188f-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T10:00:13Z", "content": "Neighborhood: Palermo, Avenida Medrano 1475 Federico Cuco is the owner of this whimsical and warmhearted bar, which is named after the author Jules Verne.

His life story is bracketed on the one end by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and on the other by the Great War. He died, yet again under financial duress, in 1918 just months before the Armistice after suffering years of an excruciating rectal cancer.\n\nHe was a notoriously stubborn man, a perfectionist indifferent to deadlines. \u201cI write solely for myself, and other people\u2019s impatience doesn\u2019t concern me,\u201d Debussy responded when queried about delivering on time. As a youth he was unwilling to yield to the rigid orthodoxies of French musical education. His teachers scolded him for his willful bucking of the rules while still acknowledging his keen ear and his exceptional sensitivity to sound and musical gesture. A classmate described him seated at the piano when class was over \u201cproducing monstrous successions of weird, barbarous chords \u2014 that is to say, chords that were not classified in the official treatises of the Conservatoire.\u201d\n\nThese provocations turned out to be much more than mere student hubris. Rather, they were the genesis of his greatest contribution to classical music: the liberation of harmony from the straitjacket of tonic-dominant attraction. Conventional tonal music, whether it\u2019s a Bach fugue or a Beatles song, is bound together by the magnetic attraction of chords, which, reduced to their essence, function as question-and-answer, the \u201cgrammar\u201d of music, as it were. If we think of the first two phrases of the song \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d we experience the first as the \u201cquestion,\u201d and the second as the \u201canswer.\u201d Almost every familiar musical motto obeys that polarity. What Debussy did was to pull apart the epoxy-strength attachment those chords share and allow them to float, not entirely free from each other, but in a more polyvalent, even ambiguous relation to each other. The result, especially when combined with his use of whole-tone scales, produced a music that felt exceptionally free of the angst and highly charged emotionalism of most of the Romantic repertoire. No surprise, then, that so many of his signature pieces embody or evoke nature, and that, as with many of the Impressionist paintings by his contemporaries, there are often no humans in the frame. A Debussy title is more often than not an image of a natural event: a warm sirocco moving across a plain; a seascape at dawn or at noon; dead leaves rustling in the breeze; early morning mists; moonlight reflecting off the surface of an old ruin.\n\nWalsh\u2019s subtitle, \u201cA Painter in Sound,\u201d amplifies those features that Debussy\u2019s aesthetic shared with seminal 19th-century painters, not only his French countrymen, but also the American James McNeill Whistler and the Englishman J. M. W. Turner, who may have had the most in common with his painterly approach to composing. \u201cLit from behind,\u201d Debussy\u2019s description of what struck him about the scoring of \u201cParsifal,\u201d is an apt way to understand his delicately luminous treatment of the orchestra in works like \u201cLa Mer,\u201d \u201cPr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi d\u2019un faune,\u201d \u201cTrois Nocturnes\u201d and especially his enigmatic late ballet \u201cJeux,\u201d a work written in 1913 that languished in obscurity until it was championed a half-century later by Pierre Boulez, who found in it an entirely new invention of \u201cirreversible\u201d musical form.\n\nImage\n\nThe young Debussy\u2019s penchant for unorthodox harmonies was given an unexpected shock stimulant when he encountered a Javanese gamelan at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889. He described his delight with this strange and wonderful music as containing \u201cevery nuance, even those one can no longer name, in which tonic and dominant were no longer anything but empty ghosts for use on naughty little children.\u201d He responded to these exotic sounds in evocative piano pieces like \u201cPagodes,\u201d which imitate the sonorous and stately movement of that music from a faraway culture he could only imagine in his mind\u2019s eye.\n\nDebussy revitalized and radicalized almost every musical form he wrote in.

His one full-length opera, the epochal \u201cPell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande,\u201d that moody chiaroscuro drama of spiritual impotence, made him, at the age of 40, suddenly famous.

Two books of \u201cPr\u00e9ludes,\u201d each with a cryptic title affixed to the final bar, range from slow, graceful dances to sultry nocturnal serenades to images of footsteps in snow, gardens in the rain, and to the evocation of a mythic underwater cathedral.

I am searching for a very particular taste, for a mixture of corn and salt and butter that will take me instantly back to a farmhouse in Lower Alabama, the house where my people lived for generations. I want my kitchen to be filled with the same scents that came from that old kitchen when the house was full of family.\n\nThe recipe I\u2019m looking for might still turn up. In her life, my mother created inscrutable taxonomies of every kind, and the cards in her recipe box were no exception. Just because a cornbread recipe isn\u2019t in the bread section does not mean it isn\u2019t in the box somewhere else. And there are hundreds of recipe cards that aren\u2019t in the box at all anymore because Mom pulled them out and never put them back.\n\nDuring the last years of her life, she ate supper at my house every night. Her own stove was unplugged for safety\u2019s sake, and there was no reason for her to spend hours poring over recipes for dishes she was never going to cook. She left the cards in little piles all over her house anyway \u2014 on bookcase shelves, on the floor beside her bed, on every side table in every room. I gathered them up in the days after her sudden death and dumped them into various baskets and boxes. Six years later, I still can\u2019t bring myself to sort through them.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mother put a hot meal on the table every night, but she was never an enthusiastic cook \u2014 no one greeted the invention of Hamburger Helper with more gratitude. I don\u2019t know why, decades later, she kept pulling out the recipe cards. Maybe she was looking for a particular recipe, too, hoping I might be persuaded to cook a dish she remembered and suddenly missed. Or maybe she wanted only to remember her own beloved dead.\n\nFor me it is always both heartbreaking and comforting to open my mother\u2019s recipe box on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The family Thanksgiving recipes are there, of course \u2014 the squash dressing, creamed spinach and pecan pie that my children regard as holiday nonnegotiables in the same way I did when I was in my 20s and feeling both the intoxication and anxiety of independence.

I wish she had dug a bit further into the way he translated them into music. Florestan\u2019s characteristic gesture, for instance, is a surge: a crescendo with no corresponding diminuendo. (Schumann\u2019s music is full of these instructions, all in a row; if you took them literally, you would end up playing louder and louder until you or the piano fell apart.) Eusebius\u2019 gesture is the circle: a phrase that bends back on itself or oscillates around a mysterious center. The difference is not just contrast. Some of Schumann\u2019s most compelling music holds these two forces in tension \u2014 centrifugal and centripetal, reaching and enfolding. He\u2019s therefore able to tap into two veins of tenderness, one overtly adult-sensual, the second magically on both ends of the child-parent bond \u2014 young wonder plus aged reverie. In other words, the masks allow Schumann to capture love as a spectrum: He gets more of it than his fellow Romantics, even Chopin, with whom love can sometimes feel like a performance.\n\nChernaik, drawn to this supercharged story and the music, has backed up her affection with solid research. She describes the key family drama with relish: Robert\u2019s initial infatuation with his piano teacher\u2019s daughter Clara, the rage of the father once the romance is discovered, endless separation, legal wrangles and (at last) some reconciliation. (Once he is happily married, the real troubles begin: Schumann\u2019s gifts waging war with the forces tearing him apart.) She narrates plainly, staying far from Schumann\u2019s overeffusive style. It isn\u2019t a gripping book for the person who already knows Schumann\u2019s music and story, but it is perfect for the newcomer, a generous and tremendously useful resource.\n\nSchumann\u2019s elusive genius has allowed for a lot of naysayers. In a recent Wall Street Journal review of this same biography, the writer gives credit to Chernaik\u2019s narrative work but can barely find time to praise Schumann\u2019s music. He refers to Schumann\u2019s spirit as \u201cexhausting,\u201d poking fun at his ardor: \u201cToday\u2019s reader might confront such a person and ask him to calm down.\u201d He lists standard concert works but omits almost all the essential ones: the joyous, meltingly beautiful Piano Quartet; the Violin Sonata in A minor; and the surge of early piano pieces, including \u201cCarnaval,\u201d \u201cKreisleriana,\u201d the \u201cFantasie\u201d and \u2014 for many pianists the holiest of holies \u2014 the \u201cDavidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze,\u201d a piece that rewards each listening more than the last.\n\nThough I don\u2019t understand them, Schumann doubters do have rational objections. Unabashed love and rational skepticism are natural companions, even symbiotic enemies. Schumann understood this as well as anyone. The final song of \u201cDichterliebe,\u201d for instance, gives voice to the bitter, skeptical breakup phase of a relationship: \u201cI\u2019m done with it all.\u201d The music is ironic, marching, strict, pitch perfect in its adopted pose of detachment. But after the singer goes silent, Schumann uses the pianist for an astounding catharsis. First, a hint of melody, syncopated against a hidden beat, ascending to some unknown goal. Then this melody gathers itself, trying to say something in the absence of words, reaching up once, twice, and a third time reaching the top of the arc of loss (while the singer remains mute, listening to his own sorrow). This phrase arrives without arriving, as life often does; when at last it recedes through various painful notes, you get something like comfort, but with all preceding heartbreak folded in. When you contemplate these great Schumann passages, humble, vulnerable and unflinching in the face of human emotions, it feels heartless to doubt."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM", "title": "Nonfiction: A Brilliant Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin", "description": "\u201cFryderyk Chopin,\u201d a magisterial new biography by Alan Walker, offers fresh insight into the legendary pianist and composer, whose reputation thrived after a life cut short by illness.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/books/review/fyderyk-chopin-alan-walker-frederic-chopin-biography.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/books/review/25Fonseca-Wollheim2/25Fonseca-Wollheim2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T10:00:07Z", "content": "Theres romance, too or at least the suggestion of it.

Squeamish readers may blanch at the amount of blood-flecked sputum the tubercular Chopin coughs up on the page, and at the procession of doctors with their leeches and milk diets. Unintentional damage came from well-meaning women. It was Sand who organized the creative retreat on an unexpectedly rain-sodden Majorca that weakened Chopin. Years later in 1848, a wealthy amateur pianist, Jane Stirling, led Chopin on a tour of England and Scotland that so exhausted the composer \u2014 ill and weighing some 95 pounds \u2014 that servants had to carry him from room to room.\n\nThere\u2019s romance, too \u2014 or at least the suggestion of it.

I\u2019m convinced you still love me, and I am as scared of you as ever,\u201d one missive reads. And: \u201cToday you will dream that you are embracing me!

For most of its nine years their relationship was conducted in separate bedrooms, their lack of relations an open secret. Walker is probably right when he speculates that the gaunt Chopin, who erupted in coughing fits at the slightest exertion, wasn\u2019t much fun in bed. But it surely seems plausible, too, that his relationship with Sand devolved into platonic companionship because Chopin just wasn\u2019t wired that way.\n\nWhatever its physical foundation, the odd symbiosis between Sand and Chopin makes for some of the most novelistic and colorful chapters in the book. Much of the time the two artists were like ships passing in the night, Sand emerging from her writing vigils \u201clike a bat coming out of its cave blinking in the sunlight,\u201d as Balzac put it, just as Chopin had his morning cup of chocolate and prepared to get down to work. It seems as if many of their most meaningful interactions occurred in her salon in front of an audience of gossipmongers.\n\nFastidious, aloof and touchy, Chopin kept even friends at arm\u2019s length. But he was also capable of reducing them to tears with comic impersonations at the piano and his letters show up his caustic wit. Walker offers insightful comments on some of his most important compositions with their pianistic innovations and expressive elegance.

A number of studies have found a significant association between prolonged sitting time over a 24-hour period and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. A 2015 study, for instance, followed more than 150,000 older adults \u2014 all of whom were healthy at the start of the study \u2014 for almost seven years on average. Researchers found that those who sat at least 12 hours a day had significantly higher mortality than those who sat for less than five hours per day.\n\nA 2012 study in JAMA Internal Medicine followed more than 220,000 people for 2.8 years on average and found similar results. Prolonged sitting over the course of a day was associated with increased all-cause mortality across sexes, ages and body mass index. So did a smaller but longer (8.6 years on average) study published in 2015 in the Journal of Physical Activity & Health.\n\nAnother study from 2015, which followed more than 50,000 adults for more than three years, also found this relationship.

Sitting itself may not be the problem; it may be a marker for other risk factors that would be associated with higher mortality. Unemployed or poorer people, who would also be more likely to have higher mortality, may be more likely to spend large amounts of time sitting at home. For some, sedentary time is a marker, not the cause, of bad outcomes.\n\nStudies looking specifically at work don\u2019t find a causal pattern.

Their studies have found that persistent co-sleeping is associated with less happy marriages and higher stress around co-parenting, though again, this is an association; there is no way to tease out cause and effect. Mothers, he said, \u201cappear to be particularly vulnerable to losing sleep,\u201d and may accumulate chronic sleep deficits, which may affect their well-being and their functioning as parents. \u201cA lot is going to depend on how the parent is reacting or responding,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things we tell parents is pay attention to your own sleep schedules, use good sleep hygiene.\u201d\n\nSome mothers can tolerate those deficits better than others, he said. \u201cNot everyone is showing stressed co-parenting or stressed marriages.\u201d Both members of the couple need to be on board with decisions about where the baby sleeps, and how night wakings will be handled, he said, and they should make sure they are taking time to nurture their own relationship.\n\nThe new study, like many other studies of variability and temperament and the different ways to take care of children, ought to be reassuring to everyone \u2014 children develop differently and there are lots of ways to grow up and be healthy.

(Foeman used this company for a minority of her research.) So this summer, when The New York Times offered to buy Johnson ancestry tests from more mainstream companies, AncestryDNA and 23andMe, she eagerly agreed.\n\nTheir tests determine ethnicity by analyzing segments of customers\u2019 DNA that give clues to their ancient geographic origins. Five hundred to 1,000 years ago, before large-scale transcontinental migration, people who lived in the same region had similar genetics. Scientists have been able to identify distinct patterns of genetic variation among people whose ancestors hail from the same lands, which is easiest to do with populations that were geographically isolated, like Finns and Filipinos, or were insular, like Ashkenazi Jews. Ideally, ancestry-testing companies would compare customers\u2019 DNA to that of people from premigration days. But given that impossibility, the companies use an imperfect proxy: people alive today who have a deep family tree in a particular geographic area, and sometimes a paper trail to prove it. Those people\u2019s DNA becomes the company\u2019s reference data set for that geographic area. When a segment of your DNA closely matches the data for that location, the company assigns you that ancestry. The more segments on your genome that match that genetic pattern, the larger your estimated percentage will be for that ancestry.\n\nThe larger the reference data set for any particular corner of the world, the better the resolution will be: suggesting that your ancestors aren\u2019t, say, just from Europe but from Northwestern Europe, or more specifically from Ireland and Scotland. Each testing company builds its own reference data set, drawn primarily from its own customers, and each company also creates its own algorithm for assigning heritage. In other words, customers\u2019 results are based on inferences and are merely an estimate, often a very rough one \u2014 something many test takers don\u2019t realize and testing companies play down.\n\nStill, Johnson, now 65, hoped the new tests would conclude that her genes aligned with who she believed herself to be. In early August, with the kits in hand, she walked around her apartment, trying to work up enough saliva to fill the little collection tubes. Afterward, Johnson was both eager for quick results and hesitant about what they might say. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201ceven if the results are the same as they were before, I am still a black woman.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, her AncestryDNA report was posted. It marked more than a third of her ancestry as \u201clow confidence,\u201d meaning it couldn\u2019t establish its ethnicity because her DNA didn\u2019t sufficiently match the company\u2019s reference data sets. She was disappointed. It\u2019s a common experience for customers with non-European ancestry, because Africa and Asia are underrepresented in many companies\u2019 data sets, in part because most of their customers \u2014 the building blocks of their reference set \u2014 are of European descent. Many companies are trying to remedy that by seeking DNA from people in regions underrepresented in the data set."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "By WILLIAM STIXRUD and NED JOHNSON", "title": "When a College Student Comes Home to Stay", "description": "Thirty percent of freshmen won\u2019t return for their sophomore year, and the wheels can start to fall off as early as Thanksgiving.

Whereas once kids drank to have fun, as early as the 2000s researchers began seeing a trend of kids drinking to manage negative emotions. They are also increasingly using pot as a way to manage anxiety, but chronic use may actually contribute to anxiety and mood disorders, as well as to psychosis. Bill\u2019s practice has seen six college students in the last two years who were hospitalized after psychotic breaks, all of whom were heavy pot smokers. We also worry about the increase of nicotine addiction among young people, as kids turn in large numbers to vaping without necessarily recognizing its risks.\n\nThe problems start well before freshman orientation, however, and the teenagers are not the only ones to blame. For so much of these students\u2019 lives, their parents, teachers, tutors and coaches have told them what to do and when. Ned frequently will offer to schedule a follow-up tutoring session with a high school senior, only to have them say, \u201cI don\u2019t know my schedule. Check with my mom.\u201d Many have not developed the skills to run their days \u2014 filling their prescriptions on time, getting their homework done without being nagged, or turning off their phones for long enough to focus.\n\nIf you question your teenager\u2019s readiness for college at the end of high school, you cannot expect that he or she will be ready by fall. It takes time, practice and some failure to learn how to run a life. And you don\u2019t want your child to learn these lessons in an environment that is as toxic as it is expensive.\n\n[Read more about helping a teenager to be ready for college.]\n\nOptions like gap years or plain and simple work experience can help students mature so that when they do enroll, they are more likely to be successful. For highly stressed, high-achieving students, a gap year offers time to recover from high school before tackling college. Other students may benefit from starting at local or community colleges.\n\nIf you have a student who has started college, the struggle may be evident in midterm grades. Many parents, however, don\u2019t see those grades. We often recommend that parents \u2014 particularly those of vulnerable students \u2014 make signing the grade release a prerequisite of funding college. After all, you wouldn\u2019t invest in a company without being able to see its quarterly earnings.\n\nIt\u2019s tricky: We want to support student autonomy and not extend the problem of too much parental oversight in high school to college. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen many kids who rarely go to class and their parents never know. Given the expense of college, parents are well within their rights to say, \u201cI need to see that you\u2019re working hard enough in order to justify my spending this money on your future.\u201d The parents\u2019 role is to avoid disaster, not micromanage short-term performance.\n\nIt may be worthwhile to try to carve out some quiet time during the Thanksgiving break to talk to your student about how the transition is going. For some, it can help to look into support services on campus, whether in the form of tutoring or mental health counseling. But at the end of the day, what your child needs most is practice running his or her own life \u2014 and college is a risky place to do that for the first time."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "By JANE E.

The answer, my friends, is that the appendix is turning out to contain biologically useful tissue that may help prevent nasty gastrointestinal ills.\n\nAs long ago as 1913, a British surgeon pointed out that the appendix is a mass of lymphoid tissue that most likely protects against harmful infections. \u201cThe vermiform appendix of man is not solely a vestigial structure,\u201d Dr. Edred M. Corner wrote in The British Medical Journal. \u201cOn the contrary, it is a specialized part of the alimentary canal, Nature having made use of a disappearing structure and endowed it with a secondary function by giving it lymphoid tissue to protect the body against the micro-organisms in the ileo-caecal region.\u201d\n\nNow, a century later, researchers have provided evidence in support of Dr. Corner, contradicting longstanding medical dogma to remove the appendix, not only when it\u2019s infected, but whenever surgery for some other reason renders it accessible. Sixteen years ago, when I was about to be operated on for a strangulated intestine, I was asked if I wanted my appendix removed at the same time.\n\nMy response was \u201cHell no! It might be useful.\u201d Though I could cite no biological evidence at the time, I suspected evolution didn\u2019t produce and preserve the appendix for no reason. As it turns out, Heather F. Smith, an evolutionary biologist, and colleagues at Midwestern University in Glendale, Ariz., have found convincing evidence that \u201cthe appendix had apparently evolved independently more than 30 times in the course of mammalian evolution, suggesting that it provided some kind of adaptive advantage,\u201d she told me.\n\n\u201cThe appendix, with its high concentration of lymphoid tissue, stimulates and supports the immune system, especially when pathogens invade the gastrointestinal tract,\u201d she explained. Furthermore, she suggested, we could do a lot better to preserve the health-promoting potential of this tissue.\n\nDr. Smith pointed out that, although great apes, several other primates and rodents have an appendix, only humans get appendicitis, a condition that predominantly afflicts people in industrialized nations who consume a Westernized high-carbohydrate, low-fiber diet that can result in calcified carbohydrate particles becoming trapped in the opening to the appendix."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "The New York Times", "title": "A Black Driver, a Marijuana Bust and a Body Camera That Turned Off", "description": "A traffic stop in New York led to a young black man being arrested for possession of marijuana.

The bickering focused even greater scrutiny on an American election system that is straining under human and mechanical error.\n\nThe acrimony in Florida followed a contentious, weekslong fight over voter suppression in Georgia, where the Republican secretary of state was overseeing a governor\u2019s race in which he was also a participant.

In 2002, President George W.

The early advantage goes to those who hail from wealthy states, with broad networks of donors, such as California and New York, and those who will start the race with a national brand and large email lists of supporters.\n\nFive Thirty Eight last month lined up the people they said were \u201cbasically running right now\u201d even if \u201csome of them end up never launching full-blown campaigns.\u201d Names on that list were:\n\nLawyer Michael Avenatti; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Montana Gov.
