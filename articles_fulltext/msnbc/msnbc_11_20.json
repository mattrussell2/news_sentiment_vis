That information was, of course, shared with Donald Trump, who made little effort to hide his skepticism.\n\nThe president announced plans to release a statement on his position on Saudi Arabia soon. Today, the White House released that statement, which came as a surprise \u2013 not necessarily because of the details of the administration\u2019s foreign policy, but because of the way in which the statement describes that policy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in exclamation point-filled formal presidential statement, said Tuesday that his administration would stand by Saudia Arabia\u2019s rulers and take no actions against them over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In the extraordinary statement, which featured six exclamation points from the president, Trump called the \u201ccrime\u201d against Khashoggi \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cone that our country does not condone.\u201d But he again stopped well short of pointing blame at Saudi Arabia \u2013 despite NBC News and other reports last week that the CIA concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u2013 and cast questions over who killed the journalist.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit too long to republish in its entirety here, but open a tab and take a couple of minutes to read the whole thing. Often, official White House statements are issued on behalf of the president, though it\u2019s obvious that Trump played no role in writing the document.\n\nToday\u2019s statement, however, was very clearly crafted by the president himself \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean that as a compliment.\n\nIt starts with two sentences that make it seem as if the White House statement is a fourth grader\u2019s book report: \u201cAmerica First! The world is a very dangerous place!\u201d\n\nIt went downhill from there, including a reference to Trump\u2019s absurd claim about a $110 billion Saudi arms deal that doesn\u2019t really exist.\n\nAnd what of the CIA\u2019s conclusion about Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s direct role in ordering Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s execution? The Republican president\u2019s statement added, \u201cOur intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t! That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nTrump has heard the findings of American intelligence professionals, and he\u2019s heard Saudi Arabian denials. In his mind, they\u2019re roughly equivalent, and the search for truth is folly.\n\nJoe Cirincione, the president of the Ploughshares Fund and an MSNBC contributor, wrote a tweet in response to Trump\u2019s statement that said, \u201cThis is, without a doubt, the most uninformed, imbecilic, toady, poorly-written, categorically untrue statement I have ever seen from a president of the United States.

Districts that lean slightly towards Democrats might have a PVI of D+2 or D+3. Districts that are safely in Republican hands might show a PVI of R+10 or greater.\n\nIn general, competitive districts are seen as having a +5 advantage or less for either party, but out of 435 U.S. House districts, eight of them have a special designation: they\u2019re exactly \u201ceven.\u201d Neither party has any advantage at all, making these eight districts the most competitive in the nation.\n\nOne of them, California\u2019s 10th, was represented by Rep. Jeff Denham (R) of California, whose \u201cblue\u201d state is getting \u201cbluer\u201d by the day. Naturally, the five-term incumbent faced an uphill climb this year, and he didn\u2019t quite make it: Denham lost to Rep.-elect Josh Harder (D) by about three points.\n\nThe outgoing congressman spoke to the Sacramento Bee about the race, and pointed to a variety of factors.\n\nDenham said his own race, as well as those of other Republicans, were faced with trouble this year from a Democratic operation well-positioned to turn out voters, unprecedented Democratic fundraising and new California voter laws designed to register more younger voters. [\u2026] Also hurting Denham was the big Latino vote. Ethnic breakdowns of the overall vote haven\u2019t been tabulated. But early returns on Latino voter turnout indicated their participation was about the same as in presidential election years for the first time in a midterm election. Denham pointed to other factors. He said Republicans were hurt by California\u2019s motor voter law, which encourages 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote as they get their driver\u2019s licenses so they will be automatically registered at 18, and same-day registration, which allowed people to register up until Election Day and cast a provisional ballot.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite how I\u2019d recommend looking at the results. In Denham\u2019s case, the California Republican voted with Donald Trump\u2019s position the overwhelming majority of the time, including siding with his party on unpopular measures such as health care repeal and tax breaks for the wealthy.\n\nIn a district with an \u201ceven\u201d PVI, one might expect a lawmaker like Denham to have one of Capitol Hill\u2019s most centrist voting records. He didn\u2019t.\n\nBut I was struck by the congressman pointing to voting reforms as a factor contributing to Republican losses. It\u2019s true that California has taken a variety of steps to encourage voter participation and to make it easier for people to cast ballots, including automatic voter registration, a motor-voter law, and same-day registration.\n\nDenham told the Bee this hurt Republicans, and that may very well be true. But it\u2019s also a striking reminder of why we see GOP officials in so many states imposing new voting restrictions: the easier it is for voters to exercise the franchise, the more significant the hurdle for Republican candidates."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Craig\u2019s mom shares recipe for Thanksgiving dressing", "description": "Craig Melvin is joined by his mom Betty Jo to talk their favorite Thanksgiving dish.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/craig-melvin/watch/craig-s-mom-shares-recipe-for-thanksgiving-dressing-1375934531717", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/n_melvin_mom_181120_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:16:36Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "How Nixon betrayed the nation before he was even president"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "Steve Benen", "title": "Tuesday's Campaign Round-Up, 11.20.18", "description": "Today's installment of campaign-related news items from across the country.", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/tuesdays-campaign-round-112018", "urlToImage": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/maddow_campaignroundup_general.png?itok=q9pFWELg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:38:06Z", "content": "Today\u2019s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * It took a while, but in Texas\u2019s 23rd congressional district, the state\u2019s most competitive, incumbent Rep.

A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists; 2.

Otherwise [White House officials] can pull your hard pass. They can also pull your hard pass if you ask two questions instead of one.\u201d\n\nThat may sound outlandish, but that\u2019s what the White House\u2019s new \u201crules\u201d say.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t exactly been subtle about his contempt for independent journalists, condemning them as, among other things, \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d The president has also raised the prospect of American news organizations committing \u201ctreason\u201d by publishing reports he doesn\u2019t like.\n\nTo that end, Trump and his team apparently believe they can take some new steps to impose restrictions on how reporters can ask questions at White House press conferences, taking control of the process, and warning those who fail to honor the official new \u201crules\u201d that they face the threat of losing access to the building.\n\nThis isn\u2019t how the process is supposed to work in the United States.

The L.A. Times reported:\n\nU.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed the state\u2019s fires on \u201cradical environmentalists\u201d who he said have prevented forest management. [\u2026] In an interview with Breitbart News, Zinke said he agrees with Trump\u2019s comments about the fires being a result of poor forest management, and repeatedly said radical environmentalists were responsible for the destruction caused by the fires.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not time for finger-pointing,\u201d Zinke told the far-right website. \u201cWe know the problem. It\u2019s been years of neglect, and in many cases it\u2019s been these radical environmentalists that want nature to take its course\u2026. You know what? This is on them.\u201d\n\nAs serious an issue as this is, it\u2019s always amusing when people preface their remarks by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not time for finger-pointing,\u201d which is immediately followed by finger-pointing.\n\nFor the scandal-plagued Interior secretary, however, it was a familiar posture. In August, for example, Zinke wrote an op-ed for USA Today in which he twice lashed out at \u201cradical environmentalists,\u201d complaining they \u201cwould rather see forests and communities burn than see a logger in the woods.\u201d\n\nSoon after, the Republican cabinet secretary insisted that climate change has \u201cnothing to do\u201d with California fires, adding, \u201cAmerica is better than letting these radical groups control the dialogue about climate change. Extreme environmentalists have shut down public access. They talk about habitat and yet they are willing to burn it up.\u201d\n\nPutting aside Zinke\u2019s preoccupation with blaming environmentalists for fires, and delaying questions about the propriety of an Interior secretary playing a misguided blame game in the midst of an ongoing and deadly disaster, let\u2019s not overlook the fact that the evidence suggests Zinke is simply wrong. The L.A. Times\u2019 report added:\n\nExperts agree that overgrown forests in California pose a heightened wildfire threat in some parts of the Sierra Nevada. But although Paradise is near forestland, the wind-whipped Camp fire tore across areas that burned in lightning fires in 2008 and were later logged. It was not fueled by heavy timber. \u201cIt started out as a vegetation fire. When it reached the incorporated area, which is definitely a lot more urban and developed of an area,\u201d Jonathan Pangburn, a fire behavior analyst for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said in an interview last week, \u201cit turned into a building-to-building fire \u2026 no longer carrying through most of the vegetation, especially in the upper canopies in the trees. It was not a crown fire through the Paradise area.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times had a related report last week on the causes of the fire. \u201cRadical environmentalists\u201d are not among the culprits."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Art workshop helps veterans with trauma", "description": "The veterans group at Community Building Art Works helps veterans work through trauma, and actor and producer Jeffrey Wright documents the program in the new film 'We Are Not Done Yet.'

Judges have also rejected Trump\u2019s executive order on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and his efforts to deny DACA protections to Dreamers, and in September, a federal court ordered the administration to end its \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that separated migrant parents and their children.\n\nSimilarly, Trump has also lost recent court fights over the Keystone XL Pipeline, press access to the White House, and the Emoluments Clause.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Republicans have scrambled to overhaul the federal judiciary and move the courts sharply to the right: it\u2019s the branch of government that keeps preventing the Trump White House from ignoring existing laws."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Trump use of troops unconscionable: Ret.

The National Security Agency also warned White House officials that use of private email accounts created a security threat. What\u2019s more, as regular readers know, one of the reasons Trump\u2019s political operation is in power is that it spent two years telling the public that Hillary Clinton should be incarcerated for having used a private email account.\n\nAnd yet, here we are.\n\nWhite House advisor and first daughter Ivanka Trump used a personal email account to send hundreds of messages to government officials last year, according to a report published Monday in the Washington Post. Many of the messages were allegedly sent in violation of federal records rules, the Post reported, and were uncovered by White House officials reviewing Ivanka Trump\u2019s emails in response to a public records lawsuit.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s article added, \u201cSome aides were startled by the volume of Ivanka Trump\u2019s personal emails \u2013 and taken aback by her response when questioned about the practice. She said she was not familiar with some details of the rules, according to people with knowledge of her reaction.\u201d\n\nPerhaps this is one of those rare instances in which a White House official experiences selective amnesia, causing her to forget a period of time known as \u201call of 2015 and 2016.\u201d\n\nComplicating matters, Ivanka Trump is hardly alone.\n\nHer husband, Jared Kushner, also used a private email account to conduct official business. In fact, the New York Times reported last year that \u201cat least six\u201d of the president\u2019s top advisers have relied on private email accounts to send and receive messages as part of their official White House duties.\n\nAt a certain level, stories like these are inherently tricky. On the one hand, controversies about executive-branch I.T. protocols are inherently boring. But on the other hand, brazen political hypocrisy matters \u2013 and in this case, the people who claimed they were disgusted by an official using a private email account are the same people who used private email accounts.\n\nThe question about judgment isn\u2019t limited to the West Wing, either. The Washington Post\u2019s Paul Waldman had a good piece along these lines awhile back, noting that this can also serve as a gut-check moment for media professionals who spent two years telling American voters that Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices were the single most important issue facing the nation.\n\nAs we discussed at the time, the political world is going to have to collectively make up its mind: either government-mandated email protocols are an issue of immense significance or they\u2019re not. If the conclusion is, it only matters when applied to a Democratic cabinet member, but not a Republican White House, then it\u2019s time we all acknowledge how painfully misguided much of the 2016 coverage was."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Senate Dems sue over Whitaker appointment", "description": "Sixteen Democrats on Monday released a letter announcing their opposition to electing Rep.
