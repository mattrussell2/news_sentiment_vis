Trump could side with his own country\u2019s intelligence assessment, but he doesn\u2019t want to \u2013 so he doesn\u2019t.\n\nThis helps explain, at least in part, why intelligence officials seemed eager to leak the CIA\u2019s findings to major news organizations late last week: intelligence professionals are obviously aware of Trump\u2019s reluctance to accept the facts, and they probably hope getting the truth to the public will increase the political pressure on the White House.\n\nIndeed, as the president pushed back against U.S. intelligence on Saudi Arabia, the top White House official on U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia, Kirsten Fontenrose, resigned on Friday night. The New York Times reported that the reasons for her departure were \u201cmurky,\u201d though Fontenrose had \u201cpushed for tough measures against the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nBut while some of the details surrounding that resignation remain unclear, what is clear is that Trump doesn\u2019t want to listen to officials in his own administration about Saudi Arabia. The intelligence is at odds with what the president wants to believe, and in this dynamic, that means the intelligence will be ignored.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s not just a matter of belief. As Rachel explained on Friday\u2019s show, Trump is looking for ways to placate Turkey \u2013 where Khashoggi was killed \u2013 as a way of calming Turkish officials down about the murder that happened in their country.\n\nIn other words, Trump isn\u2019t just eager to ignore his own country\u2019s intelligence, he\u2019s also taking steps behind the scenes to make the whole controversy go away."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MPX", "title": "Congresswoman-elect Jennifer Wexton discusses her support for...", "description": "A key vote by the Democrats over whether to support Nancy Pelosi for Speaker is set for next week, amid a rebellion fueled mostly by young freshman pushing for a regime change - but so far they don't have a challenger willing to take on the veteran Democratic\u2026", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/congresswoman-elect-jennifer-wexton-discusses-her-support-for-pelosi-as-speaker-1374881347629", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/n_mitchell_pelosi_181119_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:54:01Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Congresswoman-elect Jennifer Wexton discusses her support for Pelosi as Speaker copied!\n\nA key vote by the Democrats over whether to support Nancy Pelosi for Speaker is set for next week, amid a rebellion fueled mostly by young freshman pushing for a regime change - but so far they don't have a challenger willing to take on the veteran Democratic leader.

Trump stressed how very simple the Q&A was \u2013 he apparently saw this as a test, which he\u2019s confident he passed \u2013 while insisting that his lawyers played no role in preparing the answers.\n\nSince we\u2019re dealing with a president who\u2019s the subject of an ongoing federal investigation, it\u2019s very difficult to believe Trump\u2019s legal defense team were passive bystanders in response to the special counsel\u2019s questionnaire, but that was Trump\u2019s line and he was proud of it.\n\nWhat was less clear from his answer, though, was whether the written responses would mark the end of his communications with Mueller\u2019s team or serve as a precursor to a sit-down interview. In his latest Fox News interview, which aired yesterday, the president made the case for the former over the latter.\n\nChris Wallace asked specifically if his \u201cfinal position\u201d is that there will be no sit-down interview with the special counsel. The president said he\u2019ll \u201cprobably\u201d refuse the invitation.\n\nTRUMP: I would say probably. Probably. I mean, I can change my mind, but probably. I think we\u2019ve \u2013 WALLACE: No interview? TRUMP: I think we\u2019ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we\u2019re finished.\n\nWhen the Fox host pressed further, asking what the odds are that he\u2019d agree to a sit-down interview with Mueller and his team, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t do odds.\u201d\n\nWallace responded, \u201cYou ran a casino, sir.\u201d\n\nAnd while that was the correct response, it\u2019s important to appreciate Trump\u2019s apparent decision not to fully cooperate with the Mueller probe.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump boasted that he was \u201clooking forward to\u201d an interview with investigators \u2013 it was something he said he\u2019d \u201clove\u201d to do \u2013 adding at the time that he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d prepared to answer questions under oath. The president suggested that the interview would happen in roughly \u201ctwo or three weeks.\u201d\n\nThat was in January. In the months that followed, Trump and his legal team explored an almost comical series of alternatives to full cooperation. Now, nearly a year after the president said he\u2019d \u201clove\u201d to participate in an interview with Team Mueller, Trump appears to have changed his mind.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of a recent quote from former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired in the hopes of derailing the investigation into the Russia scandal. \u201cIn a normal world, it would be very hard for the president of the United States not to submit to an interview in connection with an investigation that touches upon \u2026 his conduct and that of people around him,\u201d Comey told Axios in May. \u201cIn a normal world, the American people would find that very, very difficult to accept.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence to bolster the point: the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent in August flagged a CNN poll that found 70% of Americans said they want Trump to give testimony to Mueller.\n\nThe same week, the Washington Post editorial board argued, \u201cThis silly game has gone on far too long. The country was attacked. Mr. Mueller is trying to determine what happened. The president should be eager to help the country learn and move on.\u201d\n\nTrump now appears eager to do the opposite. Americans deserve an explanation as to why the president, after saying he was looking forward to cooperating, has changed his mind.\n\nPostscript: Just as an aside, in July, Trump lashed out at the FBI\u2019s Lisa Page, whining that she was \u201cdodging a Subpoena\u201d and \u201crefusing to show up and testify.\u201d The president\u2019s point at the time was that those who refuse to testify should probably be seen as guilty.\n\nDo these same standards apply to him, too?"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "Steve Benen", "title": "Monday's Campaign Round-Up, 11.19.18", "description": "Today's installment of campaign-related news items from across the country.", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/mondays-campaign-round-111918", "urlToImage": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/maddow_campaignroundup_general.png?itok=q9pFWELg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:00:07Z", "content": "Today\u2019s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * In Florida\u2019s U.S. Senate race, incumbent Sen.

And everybody tells me he\u2019s doing a fantastic job.\u201d\n\nA day later, Fox News aired its latest presidential interview, in which Chris Wallace reminded Trump of Whitaker\u2019s condemnation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Russia scandal, which Whitaker is now overseeing despite his public denunciations of the probe.\n\nWALLACE: Did you know, before you appointed him, that he had that record and was so critical of Robert Mueller? TRUMP: I did not know that. I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such. WALLACE: And when you found that out? TRUMP: I don\u2019t think it had any effect. If you look at those statements \u2013 those statements that can \u2013 they really can be viewed really either way.\n\nThe president said that if Whitaker tries to curtail the special counsel\u2019s investigation, \u201cit\u2019s going to be up to him.\u201d Trump added, \u201cI would not get involved.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that Matt Whitaker was effectively an on-air pundit, peddling pro-Trump talking points during cable news appearances. It was part of a deliberate career strategy: CNN reported last week that Sam Clovis \u201cencouraged him to get a regular commentary gig on cable television to get Trump\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nAs a pundit, Whitaker was only too pleased to frequently condemn Mueller\u2019s investigation in over-the-top ways, even referring to the special counsel\u2019s team as \u201cMueller\u2019s lynch mob.\u201d The idea that his comments \u201ccan be viewed really either way\u201d is absurd.\n\nThe Republican lawyer was then plucked from relative obscurity and given a plum job at the Justice Department \u2013 and at least for now, he\u2019s the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official.\n\nIt\u2019s implausible to think Trump had no idea what Whitaker thought of the Mueller probe. After all, Whitaker\u2019s criticisms of Mueller were effectively his audition tape for a job in the administration. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s the inconvenient fact the president blurted out last week that Whitaker\u2019s appointment was directly tied to Trump\u2019s opposition to the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nThat admission makes his comments to Chris Wallace that much more difficult to believe.\n\nAs for the idea that Trump intends to take a hands-off posture if Whitaker tries to curtail the Mueller probe, this is starting to look like a political scheme that\u2019s eating its own tail: Whitaker denounced the special counsel\u2019s investigation, so Trump tapped Whitaker to oversee the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Trump then pretends he had no idea what Whitaker\u2019s position was, vowing that the White House won\u2019t \u201cget involved\u201d in the acting AG\u2019s oversight of the probe.\n\nExcept this is ridiculous because by tapping an anti-Mueller partisan to lead the Justice Department, the president has obviously already gotten \u201cinvolved\u201d in rather dangerous ways.\n\nPostscript: If you missed Rachel\u2019s A block on Friday about Whitaker and his disqualifications for his current post, it\u2019s well worth your time."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "Steve Benen", "title": "Trump to nominate coal lobbyist Wheeler...", "description": "It may be tempting to think Andrew Wheeler's leadership of the EPA won't be much worse than Scott Pruitt's.

That exhale ended the moment they saw who\u2019d take Pruitt\u2019s place.\n\nDonald Trump announced at the time that the Environmental Protection Agency would be led, at least temporarily, by Andrew Wheeler \u2013 a former lobbyist for, among others, Murray Energy, one of the nation\u2019s largest coal companies. Wheeler also served as chief counsel for Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of the nation\u2019s preeminent climate deniers.\n\nThe New Republic\u2019s Emily Atkin recently explained, \u201cWheeler is not just the figurative embodiment of the swamp, but the literal embodiment of it. The coal industry is responsible for 72 percent of toxic water contamination in the United States, making it the nation\u2019s largest water polluter. That\u2019s according to the agency where Wheeler is about to be second in command \u2013 the agency that is charged with protecting clean water.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that the president intends to remove the word \u201cacting\u201d from Wheeler\u2019s current job title. The Washington Post reported:\n\nPresident Trump said Friday that he intends to nominate former industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler as the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s next administrator, a move that would ensure a continued deregulatory push at the agency. Trump made the impromptu announcement during a Medal of Freedom ceremony at the White House, saying that Wheeler had done a \u201cfantastic job\u201d as the agency\u2019s acting administrator in recent months. Wheeler took the helm in early July after Scott Pruitt resigned amid mounting ethics scandals.\n\nSome may be tempted to assume that Wheeler\u2019s leadership of the EPA won\u2019t be much worse than Pruitt\u2019s. I disagree.\n\nPruitt wasn\u2019t just accused of widespread corruption; he was also hopelessly incompetent. In many respects, environmentalists got lucky in this regard. I\u2019m reminded of this New York Times report from April:\n\n[L]egal experts and White House officials say that in Mr. Pruitt\u2019s haste to undo government rules and in his eagerness to hold high-profile political events promoting his agenda, he has often been less than rigorous in following important procedures, leading to poorly crafted legal efforts that risk being struck down in court. The result, they say, is that the rollbacks, intended to fulfill one of the president\u2019s central campaign pledges, may ultimately be undercut or reversed\u2026. Six of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s efforts to delay or roll back Obama-era regulations \u2013 on issues including pesticides, lead paint and renewable-fuel requirements \u2013 have been struck down by the courts. Mr. Pruitt also backed down on a proposal to delay implementing smog regulations and another to withdraw a regulation on mercury pollution. Richard Lazarus, a professor of environmental law at Harvard, told the Times, \u201cIn their rush to get things done, [Pruitt and his team are] failing to dot their i\u2019s and cross their t\u2019s. And they\u2019re starting to stumble over a lot of trip wires, They\u2019re producing a lot of short, poorly crafted rulemakings that are not likely to hold up in court.\u201d\n\nWheeler, in contrast, knows what he\u2019s doing.\n\nUnder Mr. Pruitt, who resigned July 5 under a cloud of ethics investigations, the agency pushed for ambitious but fast-paced rollbacks of environmental rules. At least a half-dozen of those have been struck down by federal courts. Mr. Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who served as Mr. Pruitt\u2019s deputy, has brought a more disciplined approach to dismantling environmental rules. It is an approach that may take longer, but it may be more effective in standing up to the inevitable legal challenges. Prof. Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University, said Mr. Wheeler was \u201ctrying to be more careful and less sloppy\u201d than his former boss. \u201cBy taking time to improve the quality of the legal justifications, Wheeler may ensure that E.P.A. won\u2019t be subject to losing on certain types of policies,\u201d Professor Revesz said.\n\nMaybe some Senate Republicans will balk before confirming a coal lobbyist to lead the EPA? Don\u2019t count on it. In the next Senate, at least four GOP senators would have to balk \u2013 and in April, when the chamber voted on Wheeler\u2019s nomination to be deputy administrator of the EPA, literally zero Republicans voted \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThat includes the ostensible \u201cmoderates\u201d \u2013 Maine\u2019s Susan Collins and Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski \u2013 both of whom backed Wheeler\u2019s confirmation."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MPX", "title": "Nat Geo's 'Mars' returns for second season", "description": "What could humanity's future on Mars actually look like?

The president was specifically excited about Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race, which ended late on Friday afternoon with Brian Kemp\u2019s (R) victory.\n\nReferring to some of Stacey Abrams\u2019 (D) high-profile supporters, Trump told Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, \u201cI won against President Obama and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama in a great state called Georgia for the governor. And it was all stacked against Brian and I was the one that went for Brian and Brian won.\u201d\n\nI can appreciate at some level why the president is eager to boast about the results, but the idea that \u201cit was all stacked against\u201d Brian Kemp is demonstrably ridiculous. In fact, the exact opposite is true: it was all stacked in Kemp\u2019s favor, thanks to Kemp\u2019s own efforts to ensure his own success. Mother Jones\u2019 Ari Berman summarized this nicely:\n\nThere were a multitude of voting problems in the gubernatorial race between Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams. Eligible voters didn\u2019t show up on the registration rolls or were purged by the state. Thousands of Georgians had their registrations put on hold and weren\u2019t sure if they\u2019d be able to vote. Some voters were wrongly flagged as non-citizens; others had their ballots rejected because poll workers told them they had the wrong ID. Hundreds of polling places were shuttered before the election, and other precincts had four-hour lines. Absentee ballots were rejected because of signature mismatches or other minor errors. One Abrams adviser described it as \u201cdeath by a thousand paper cuts.\u201d [\u2026] We don\u2019t know yet \u2013 and might never know \u2013 how many people were disenfranchised or dissuaded from voting in the state. But it\u2019s clear that Kemp did everything in his power to put in place restrictive voting policies that would help his candidacy and hurt his opponent, all while overseeing his own election.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s system didn\u2019t fail as a result of neglect or incompetence. Rather, Kemp, in his capacity as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state and chief elections official, designed a process that worked exactly as intended.\n\nThere\u2019s a debate underway in some circles about whether it\u2019s fair for Democrats to use the word \u201cstolen\u201d in reference to this race, and the language certainly matters.\n\nBut let\u2019s not miss the forest for the trees: Brian Kemp really did oversee a massive purge of the voter rolls. He really did needlessly freeze thousands of voter registration applications. He really did close key polling places. He really did falsely accuse Georgia Democrats of an illegal \u201chack\u201d just days before Election Day.\n\nIn this fight over who was allowed to register, who was allowed to vote, and who was allowed to have their ballot counted, Brian Kemp wrote the rules for his own election. A cloud of illegitimacy hangs over the process, and it\u2019s likely to follow the far-right governor-elect.\n\nThere is no sane way to look at these circumstances and conclude that \u201cit was all stacked against Brian.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Orange County flips entirely blue after being a GOP stronghold for years", "description": "Democrats picked up another House seat in California\u2019s once Republican stronghold.

Take the story of Mira Ricardel, for example.\n\nIn a move without any known precedent, First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s office announced early last week that she believes Ricardel, the White House\u2019s deputy national security adviser, \u201cno longer deserves the honor\u201d of serving in that position.\n\nA day later, Ricardel was out, moved to \u201ca new role within the administration.\u201d\n\nIn a Fox News interview that aired yesterday, Chris Wallace asked about the developments.\n\nWALLACE: Your deputy national security advisor was moved out after your wife did something I\u2019ve never heard of a first lady doing before publicly calling for her removal. Are you comfortable with the way that went down where it kind of looked like your wife was firing one of your advisors? TRUMP: Well, I didn\u2019t know the advisor well, really, and I know they had a lot of problems\u2026. They came to me. They wanted to go a little bit public because that\u2019s the way they felt and I thought it was fine. I met with Mira two days ago and we\u2019re going to move her around. She was with me for a long time, although I don\u2019t know her. She\u2019s really somebody I don\u2019t know very well. But we\u2019re going to move her around because she\u2019s got certain talents.\n\nSo, when Wallace said it \u201ckind of looked like\u201d Melania Trump \u201cwas firing one of your advisors,\u201d that\u2019s because the First Lady really was responsible for ousting the White House deputy national security adviser.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on this, but this is all quite bonkers.\n\nThe official responsibilities of the First Lady have always been a bit murky. It\u2019s generally a ceremonial position \u2013 voters don\u2019t give a presidential spouse any official power \u2013 though every modern First Lady has tackled specific causes and campaigns of personal interest and/or national significance. Melania Trump, for example, has taken an interest in online bullying.\n\nAs her husband refers to incoming House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) as \u201cAdam Schitt,\u201d it appears those efforts aren\u2019t going especially well.\n\nRegardless, the idea of a First Lady firing a White House deputy national security adviser is outlandish for a fairly obvious reason: there\u2019s no reason Melania Trump should have any influence over national security policy or personnel.\n\nAsked about this, the sitting president of the United States said \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 he didn\u2019t specify who \u2013 went public with his wife\u2019s position, and he \u201cthought it was fine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cfine\u201d at all."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "President Trump speaks out about Mueller and the military", "description": "Following an extensive interview with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, President Trump spoke out about the Mueller investigation and attacked a veteran who has spoken out against him.

Jerry Brown (D) and incoming Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), a reporter asked Trump about preventing future fire catastrophes. The president responded:\n\n\u201cWe have been talking about that on the ride over. I think we\u2019re all on the same path. We have to do management, maintenance, and we will be working also with environmental groups. I think everybody has seen the light. [\u2026] \u201cWe have to take care of the floors, the floors of the forest. It is very important. You look at other countries, they do it definitely and it is a whole different story. I was with the president of Finland and he said, \u2018We\u2019re a forest nation.\u2019 He called it a \u2018forest nation.\u2019 And they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don\u2019t have any problem. And when it is, it is a very small problem.\u201d\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinisto said he didn\u2019t know what Trump was referring to. Many in Finland, meanwhile, took the opportunity to mock the confused American president.\n\nIn case that weren\u2019t quite enough, speaking soon after at an Incident Command Post briefing, Trump was asked, \u201cDoes seeing this devastation \u2026 change your opinion at all on climate change, Mr. President?\u201d He replied, \u201cNo. No. I have a strong opinion. I want great climate.\u201d\n\nTrump is under the mistaken impression that his \u201copinion\u201d about climate science is relevant.\n\nHe also doesn\u2019t seem at all interested in the fact that forest management isn\u2019t to blame. As the Associated Press reported last week:\n\nOne reason that scientists know that management isn\u2019t to blame is that some areas now burning had fires in 2005 and 2008, so they aren\u2019t \u201cfuel-choked closed-canopy forests,\u201d Dennison said. In those earlier fires, Paradise was threatened but escaped major damage, he said. In the current blazes, it was virtually destroyed. The other major fire, in Southern California, burned through shrub land, not forest, [University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison] said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about forest management. These aren\u2019t forests,\u201d he said. The dean of the University of Michigan\u2019s environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \u201cis much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\u201d\n\nAll he had to do was go to California, express sympathy, and pledge support. Instead we can add this to the list of crises and disasters Trump has tried, and failed, to address responsibility.\n\nPostscript: During his visit to Paradise, California, the president managed to get the community\u2019s name wrong \u2013 twice."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Joe: Trump lying about one of our great heroes", "description": "President Trump derided retired Adm.
