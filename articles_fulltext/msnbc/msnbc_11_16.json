Senate Republicans enjoyed a map so heavily tilted in their favor that some thought the GOP might be able to reach a 60-seat majority in this cycle. A month before Election Day, the National Republican Senatorial Committee expected to end up with as many as 55 seats. The party obviously fell short of both thresholds.\n\nIn fact, the standard for success keeps falling. Last week, Trump said Republicans had won 55 seats. Earlier this week, it was 54. Now, it\u2019s 53.\n\nA cynic might wonder if the president is simply pretending to be impressed with a two-seat pickup because Democrats fared so well in every other area of the election cycle.\n\nBut in terms of the public-relations offensive, Trump seems quite serious. In his interview with The Daily Caller argued:\n\n\u201cSo we picked up three or four Senate seats depending on how it all goes \u2013 it\u2019s a big pickup. In fact, they say in 80 years I think the presidential party\u2019s only picked up two Senate seats, I picked up three.\u201d\n\nHe actually picked up two, and the White House\u2019s party has now added Senate seats in midterm cycles three times in the last 56 years.\n\n\u201cYou look at some of the people that won, they wouldn\u2019t have won without my helping them. And then you look at the new senators, you look at Indiana, Donnelly was not going to happen. Nobody said Donnelly was going to lose.\u201d\n\nActually, Sen. Joe Donnell (D-Ind.) was endangered the day he took office, and everyone saw him as one of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents.\n\n\u201cTester, nobody wanted even to contest it.\u201d\n\nActually, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) was another red-state Democrat whom observers expected to face a tough fight.\n\n\u201cWell, look at what happened in North Dakota with Heidi. Heidi, they said don\u2019t contest. One year ago when we were looking, they all said don\u2019t contest Heidi, she can\u2019t be beat.\u201d\n\nLiterally no one said that about Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). For two years, she was seen as the chamber\u2019s most vulnerable Democrat.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t do those stops, I think we would\u2019ve lost 10 Senate seats, seven to 10 Senate seats.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s literally impossible: there weren\u2019t 10 Republicans up for re-election this year.\n\nI can\u2019t say with confidence whether the president actually believes any of his claims; it\u2019s possible he\u2019s just desperate to find a silver lining after his party struggled through the cycle.

Michigan voters, for example, approved sweeping election changes, including the creation of an independent redistricting commission that will be responsible for drawing congressional district lines.\n\nIn Colorado and Missouri, voters agreed to overhaul the redistricting process to end gerrymandering. (Utah may have done the same thing, but votes on the state\u2019s Proposition 4 are still being tallied.)\n\nThe bad news is, gerrymandered districts still exist across much of the country. Cleveland.com reported yesterday:\n\n[Republicans in Ohio\u2019s state legislature] scored their wins for 63 percent of the seats while collecting just over 50 percent of the total vote. This is a lot like what happened in Ohio\u2019s 16 congressional districts, where Republicans won 75 percent of the seats with just 52 percent of the overall vote. These are two fresh examples of how skillfully gerrymandered legislative districts can sway the balance of power \u2013 especially when one party is in full control of drawing the maps as was the case for the current districts.\n\nRegular readers may recall that Ohio policymakers approved some modest reforms to the redistricting process in May, but those changes won\u2019t be implemented until after the 2020 Census.\n\nOf course, the Buckeye State isn\u2019t the only one where gerrymandering was an issue. Mother Jones\u2019 Ari Berman reported yesterday that in Wisconsin, Democratic candidates managed to win a majority of the state Assembly votes, but thanks to the lines drawn by Republicans, it\u2019s the GOP that will hold a majority of the seats.\n\nThe Washington Post also reported this week, \u201cMajorities of voters in at least three battleground states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina \u2013 chose a Democrat to represent them in the state\u2019s House of Representatives. Yet in all three states, Republicans maintained majority control over the chamber despite winning only a minority of votes.\u201d\n\nA separate Washington Post piece highlighted a similar imbalance in North Carolina at the congressional level.\n\nThese fights, however, are far from over. Not only are more and more Americans souring on gerrymandered maps, but reform advocates are turning to the judiciary with renewed optimism about court-imposed changes. There\u2019s a new lawsuit in North Carolina, for example, that appears likely to reach the state Supreme Court, and as a Slate piece explained this week, \u201cThe case could give Democrats a real shot at retaking the legislature in 2020, or at least contesting it on an even playing field.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "Steve Benen", "title": "Friday's Campaign Round-Up, 11.16.18", "description": "Today's installment of campaign-related news items from across the country.", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fridays-campaign-round-111618", "urlToImage": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/maddow_campaignroundup_general.png?itok=q9pFWELg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:40:29Z", "content": "Today\u2019s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * Democratic continue to rack up wins in U.S. House races in California, with several news outlets last night calling the 45th district for Katie Porter (D), who appears to have defea\u2026 [+1411 chars]", "fulltext": "Today\u2019s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country.\n\n* Democrats continue to rack up wins in U.S. House races in California, with several news outlets last night calling the 45th district for Katie Porter (D), who appears to have defeated incumbent Rep.

Trump\u2019s evidence is abundant: he has military flags in the Oval Office; he\u2019s lobbied for a massive military parade; he\u2019s increased military spending; and he likes talking about his support for the military.\n\nBut the New York Times had a great piece today looking at the issue in a way the president won\u2019t appreciate.\n\nHe canceled a trip to a cemetery in France where American soldiers from World War I are buried. He did not go to the observance at Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day. He has not visited American troops in Iraq or Afghanistan. And shortly after becoming commander in chief, President Trump asked so few questions in a briefing at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., that top military commanders cut the number of prepared PowerPoint slides to three from 18, said two officials with knowledge of the visit. The commanders had slotted two hours for the meeting, but it lasted less than one. Rhetorically, Mr. Trump has embraced the United States\u2019 1.3 million active-duty troops as \u201cmy military\u201d and \u201cmy generals\u201d and has posted on Twitter that under his leadership, the American armed forces will be \u201cthe finest that our Country has ever had.\u201d But top Defense Department officials say that Mr. Trump has not fully grasped the role of the troops he commands, nor the responsibility that he has to lead them and protect them from politics.\n\nThere were hints along these lines before Trump took office. Ahead of the 2016 election, the then-Republican candidate mocked prisoners of war \u2013 he likes soldiers \u201cwho weren\u2019t captured\u201d \u2013 lied about his financial support for veterans\u2019 charities, claimed more than once that he understood counter-terrorism better than American generals, and publicly feuded with a Gold Star family.\n\nBut as president, the problem has become more acute.\n\nIndeed, Trump hasn\u2019t just been careless in his deployments, he\u2019s even tried to avoid responsibility after approving failed missions. Soon after taking office, Trump authorized a mission in Yemen, which claimed the life of Navy SEAL William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, and when pressed for answers on what transpired, the president said the buck stopped somewhere else.\n\n\u201cThis was something that was, you know, just, they wanted to do,\u201d the president said, referring to U.S. generals. \u201cThey came to see me they explained what they wanted to do, the generals \u2026 and they lost Ryan.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press asked Trump last month why he hasn\u2019t yet visited a military base in a combat zone like in Iraq and Afghanistan. The president said he would eventually, though he didn\u2019t see it as \u201coverly necessary.\u201d\n\nTrump added, \u201cI\u2019ve been very busy with everything that\u2019s taking place here\u2026. I\u2019m doing a lot of things. I\u2019m doing a lot of things.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 report went on to note, \u201cOne reason he has not visited troops in war zones, according to his aides, is that he does not really want American troops there in the first place. To visit, they said, would validate missions he does not truly believe in.\u201d\n\nThis is not the perspective of a president who fully appreciates what it means to be commander in chief.\n\nCol. David Lapan, a retired Marine who served in the Trump administration in 2017 as a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, told the Times, \u201cThere was the belief that over time, he would better understand, but I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the case. I don\u2019t think that he understands the proper use and role of the military and what we can, and can\u2019t, do.\u201d\n\nPresumably, Trump could take the time to learn, but there\u2019s a lot of television to watch and he\u2019s \u201cdoing a lot of things.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Book on US history looks at spirit of compromise", "description": "Author and professor H.W.

No one in Congress had any idea what the president was talking about, and even White House officials quietly conceded they were \u201cmystified.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t care. The plan, which appeared to exist only in his imagination, quickly became a major applause line at the president\u2019s campaign rallies. Pressed by reporters for details, Trump boasted that he and his team had came up with a way to make his new tax plan \u201crevenue neutral based on certain things.\u201d\n\nThe Nov. 1 deadline came and went, and the plan the president promised to present never materialized. Yesterday, Politico published a report suggesting the policy, which never really existed in any meaningful way, is dead.\n\nWhite House officials are not counting on a big infrastructure package or a deal on the kind of middle-class tax cut Trump promised at the end of the campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve been noodling more on this middle-class tax cut, how to structure it, and even pay for it,\u201d National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said in a recent interview in his West Wing office. \u201cI don\u2019t think the chances of that are very high, because the Democrats are going to go after the corporate tax and all that stuff.\u201d\n\nFor those who\u2019ve watched Trump and his operation closely in recent years, the fact that Trump made up a fictional policy, and peddled it as if it were real, is hardly shocking. Indeed, it\u2019s one of the key takeaways from his farcical little story: the president simply says stuff, without any meaningful concerns about whether his stuff reflects reality in any way.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only lesson. The fact that Trump made up a tax policy just weeks ahead of Election Day \u2013 it was exclusively for the \u201cmiddle class,\u201d he said \u2013 was also emblematic of the fact that even the president realized that the actual Republican tax package was a political failure.\n\nIndeed, the rest of the GOP\u2019s pitch wasn\u2019t much better. With time running out before the midterms, after nearly two years of attempts at governing, Trump came up with an entirely new vision, consisting of a made-up tax plan, fears of an imaginary \u201cinvasion,\u201d a health care \u201cplan\u201d that didn\u2019t exist, and chatter of an executive order the president hoped to issue \u2013 but could not legally expect to implement \u2013 that would\u2019ve negated part of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nNow that the elections are nearly over, that agenda has suddenly disappeared.

If you want to look for it, I will look for it.\u201d\n\nTo unpack this a bit, Graham is describing a handful of interconnected conspiracy theories, including his belief that the Justice Department overlooked Hillary Clinton\u2019s crimes \u2013 a rather ridiculous idea already discredited by the DOJ\u2019s inspector general \u2013 coupled with similarly odd ideas about the \u201cSteele dossier\u201d and surveillance of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nGraham, evidently, is prepared to use the Senate Judiciary Committee to scrutinize all of this, for reasons that only appear to have merit with the most rabid of partisans.\n\nBut what struck me as especially notable about this was the way in which Graham presented this agenda as something of a threat.\n\nNote, the GOP senator \u2013 who seems to be enjoying his status as a partisan celebrity a bit too much \u2013 didn\u2019t just talk about his Clinton-related conspiracy theories in their own right; he did so as a message to his \u201cDemocratic friends.\u201d\n\nIf they \u201cwant to look backwards\u201d \u2013 which is to say, if they\u2019re prepared to examine Russia\u2019s attack on our election in order to help the Kremlin\u2019s preferred candidate \u2013 then Lindsey Graham will do the same. If those rascally Dems \u201care going to keep plowing everything up,\u201d then the South Carolinian wants them to know he\u2019s prepared to scrutinize recent history, too.\n\nThe implication seems to be that if Democrats don\u2019t \u201clook backwards,\u201d and they don\u2019t investigate matters such as Putin\u2019s efforts to put Trump in power, Lindsey Graham will be less eager to investigate Clinton-related conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cIf you want to look for it,\u201d Graham said in his message to Democrats, referring to 2016, \u201cI will look for it.\u201d\n\nThe larger question is, why is the senator \u2013 who\u2019s become one of Donald Trump\u2019s more sycophantic allies \u2013 so worried about Democrats examining the Russia scandal?\n\n* Update: This morning, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) announced he\u2019s stepping down as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, clearing the way for Graham to claim the gavel.

As is usually the case with Trump, his answer meandered for a while, and eventually arrived at the Republican\u2019s concerns about losing New Hampshire in the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what happened in New Hampshire, where thousands of people came up and voted from a very liberal part of Massachusetts and they came up in buses and they voted. \u201cI said, \u2018What\u2019s going on over here?\u2019 My people said, \u2018You won New Hampshire easily except they have tremendous numbers of buses coming up.\u2019 They\u2019re pouring up by the hundreds, buses of people getting out, voting.\u201d\n\nTrump added, \u201cSo what do you do? Recall the election. Recall the election. I mean, there, you should be able to recall the election.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t the foggiest idea what he means by \u201crecall the election,\u201d but the president\u2019s preoccupation with this conspiracy theory \u2013 about an election in which he won \u2013 offers a peek into Trump\u2019s misguided perspective on voter fraud that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nCircling back to our previous coverage, this is one of those odd beliefs he just can\u2019t shake. Just weeks into his presidency, Trump met with a group of senators to discuss Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination. The president, for reasons that weren\u2019t altogether clear, insisted at the meeting that he would\u2019ve won New Hampshire had it not been for widespread voter fraud.\n\nAccording to a Politico report, after Trump insisted illegal votes were cast by people \u201cbrought in on buses,\u201d there was \u201can uncomfortable silence\u201d in the room.\n\nA year later, in February 2018, the president spoke at a Republican National Committee dinner, and again claimed that the only reason he narrowly lost New Hampshire in 2016 was voter fraud.\n\nGiven his intense and ongoing interest in the subject, someone probably ought to alert him to this report from WMUR, published in May.\n\nAn exhaustive review by state election officials, including a first-time comparison of voter information shared with 27 other states, has turned up virtually no evidence of possible voter fraud in New Hampshire, those officials said Tuesday. Secretary of State William Gardner, other officials from his office and a top election law attorney from the attorney general\u2019s office made a more than two-hour presentation to the state Ballot Law Commission, which is charged with resolving disputes related to election laws. The review consumed 817 work hours by members of the attorney general\u2019s office with help from the Department of Safety.\n\nThe review process was actually pretty interesting. New Hampshire officials started with the highly dubious Crosscheck system, which pointed to more than 94,000 possible examples of people casting more than one ballot. Secretary of State Bill Gardner was able to quickly narrow that list down to 4,579. After accounting for middle names and initials, the list shrunk again to 3,624.\n\nUsing a variety of related methods, the state continued to gradually narrow the list from 955 to 142 to 91 to five. Does that mean New Hampshire found five real-world examples of actual voter fraud?\n\nNot exactly. As Slate\u2019s Mark Joseph Stern explained a while back, \u201cOne college student voted in the wrong location on the faulty instruction of an election official. An elderly woman appears to have filled out her recently deceased husband\u2019s absentee ballot. Two people cast a ballot in Dixville Notch\u2019s famous midnight primary without establishing domicile there. Just one person actually voted twice; he was fined $2,500 and threatened with criminal prosecution if he ever did it again.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s all the evidence showed. There was literally nothing to suggest out-of-state voters \u2013 with or without the benefit of buses \u2013 cast any ballots in New Hampshire at all.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t that the results are surprising. They were actually quite predictable. Rather, the point is that Trump and his team peddled a ridiculous conspiracy theory and not only expected the public to believe it, but also hoped their bogus claims could help create a demand for new voting restrictions across the country.\n\nAnd six months after the comprehensive report on the New Hampshire elections, Trump is still pointing to the same conspiracy theory, insisting that he won New Hampshire \u201ceasily,\u201d despite losing in the state.\n\nThe more the president points to anecdotes like these to justify new voter-suppression policies, the more important it is to remember that he doesn\u2019t appear to have any idea what he\u2019s talking about."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "Steve Benen", "title": "Republican senator's provocative 'jokes'...", "description": "First it was a \"joke\" about public hangings.

It\u2019s a state where Donald Trump won his election by 18 points, and where Republicans tend to dominate.\n\nBut in this year\u2019s final major contest, election watchers suddenly have a reason to keep an eye on the Magnolia State.\n\nIt was earlier this week that we learned about comments from incumbent Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R), who recently joked about attending \u201ca public hanging.\u201d Given the state\u2019s history, and the fact that she\u2019s running against Mike Espy (D), an African American former congressman, the Republican\u2019s comments struck a dissonant note.\n\nYesterday, the story took another unsettling turn.\n\nA video surfaced Thursday of Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi saying it might be a \u201cgreat idea\u201d to make it harder for some people to vote, and her campaign quickly responded that she was \u201cobviously\u201d joking. Hyde-Smith, who is in a runoff against Democrat Mike Espy on Nov. 27, made the remark at a campaign stop in Starkville, Mississippi, on Nov. 3. It was posted to Twitter on Thursday by Lamar White Jr., publisher of The Bayou Brief. Smith earlier this week posted video of Hyde-Smith making a comment on Nov. 2 about a \u201cpublic hanging\u201d that started a controversy. \u201cAnd then they remind me that there\u2019s a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who \u2026 maybe we don\u2019t want to vote,\u201d Hyde-Smith is heard saying. \u201cMaybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter message posted late yesterday, the GOP senator wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s ok to still have a sense of humor in America isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nOf course, while having a sense of humor is a good idea, it\u2019s also a good idea for political leaders in a state with a troubled history on race to avoid \u201cjokes\u201d about public hangings and deliberately making it harder for certain people to vote.\n\nA spokesperson for Mike Espy\u2019s campaign called Hyde-Smith a \u201cwalking stereotype who embarrasses our state,\u201d adding, \u201cFor a state like Mississippi, where voting rights were obtained through sweat and blood, everyone should appreciate that this is not a laughing matter.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to local experts to say whether, and to what degree, this might affect the upcoming election, but at a distance, there\u2019s reason to believe the race may be more competitive than many first assumed.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee launched a television ad campaign in the state this week, and if Hyde-Smith was a shoo-in, the party probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered. The White House, meanwhile, is reportedly weighing a possible presidential pre-election visit to Mississippi.\n\nThe Republican senator launched a new ad of her own this week, and one of the first names mentioned in the commercial is financier George Soros \u2013 which is hardly evidence of a candidate confident about her chances of success.\n\nLast week, in a multi-candidate field, Hyde-Smith finished with 41.5% of the vote, to Espy\u2019s 40.6%. Because neither candidate reached the 50% threshold, there will be a special election on Nov. 27, which is just 11 days away.\n\nThe two candidates are also scheduled to participate in a debate on Nov. 20."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MPX", "title": "Republicans lose 'Reagan Country' in Orange County", "description": "Democrat Katie Porter captured a Republican-held U.S. House seat Thursday in the heart of what once was Reagan country in Orange County.
