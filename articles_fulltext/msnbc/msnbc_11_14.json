Whitaker as acting attorney general \u2013 rejecting criticism from some lawyers that the move violates the Constitution.\u201d\n\n* Remember, Trump hates Amazon because of some weird theory about the Washington Post: \u201cPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday that Virginia and New York are \u201dpaying a very big price\u2019 to house Amazon\u2019s next headquarters, adding that \u2018time will tell\u2019 on the merits of the deals.\u201d\n\n* Still not fired: \u201cOne day after first lady Melania Trump\u2019s office called for the ouster of deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel, a White House official confirmed Wednesday that Ricardel is still employed there.\u201d\n\n* A Brexit step forward: \u201cBritain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, faced down her hard-line critics on Wednesday and won the support of a jittery cabinet for a plan to quit the European Union, keeping on track her push to avert an economically damaging rupture with the bloc in March.\u201d\n\n* Another discouraging Facebook story: \u201cWhile Mr. Zuckerberg conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros.\u201d\n\n* Yemen: \u201cThe United States has waged a drone war in Yemen for 16 years, trying to suppress al-Qaida\u2019s branch here. But the campaign has had a hidden cost: civilians cut down by the drones\u2019 missiles. There is no comprehensive count of civilian deaths because of the difficulty of confirming identities and allegiances of those killed. But in an examination of drone strikes this year alone, The Associated Press found that at least 30 of the dead likely did not belong to al-Qaida.\u201d\n\n* Nearly two years later, there\u2019s finally a nominee: \u201cPresident Trump announced Tuesday that he will nominate retired Army Gen. John Abizaid to become the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, filling a vacancy that was spotlighted by the difficult diplomacy between the United States and Riyadh over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nAnything to add?

As the American president mocked our French allies yesterday \u2013 complete with an all-caps missive that read, \u201cMake France Great Again!\u201d \u2013 France was recognizing the three-year anniversary of an ISIS terrorist attack in Paris that killed 130 people.\n\nTrump may not have realized the significance of the date, but he didn\u2019t bother to check, either. Reuters reports that this did not go unnoticed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who attacked his French counterpart in a series of tweets on Tuesday, should have shown \u201ccommon decency\u201d instead since the country was mourning the anniversary of deadly attacks in Paris, a French government spokesman said. In five posts sent on the same day France marked the anniversary of the 2015 attacks that killed 130 people, Trump blasted the key U.S. ally over its near defeat to Germany in two world wars, its wine industry and President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s approval ratings.\n\n\u201cYesterday was November 13, we were marking the murder of 130 of our people,\u201d French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told Reuters. \u201cSo I\u2019ll reply in English: \u2018common decency\u2019 would have been appropriate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult sentiment to disagree with.\n\nTrump\u2019s offensive was misguided anyway, given that it was rooted in confusion. Emmanuel Macron recently spoke about Europe taking responsibility for its own security, and not looking to the United States for protection, which is a sentiment the Republican White House should agree with. The American president, however, decided it was \u201cvery insulting\u201d \u2013 because in Trump\u2019s mind, Macron recommended building an army to protect Europe from Americans.\n\nThe larger context, of course, is every bit as important as the Republican\u2019s misplaced assumptions. After Macron took office, he seemed to have a strategy in mind: Trump may have alienated many of the United States\u2019 allies, but the young French president seemed determined to forge a partnership with the American leader.\n\nHe even threw Trump a parade, which the Republican seemed to thoroughly enjoy.\n\nBut the relationship now appears to be unraveling. I\u2019m reminded of something Politico reported over the summer, \u201cForeign leaders are learning that hand-holding, golf games, military parades and other efforts to personally woo President Donald Trump do not guarantee that Trump won\u2019t burn them.\u201d\n\nThe article quoted one former White House official saying, \u201cTrump is very selfish and I think he views flattery as a one-way street where he gets flattered and then there\u2019s no real reciprocal benefit going back the other direction. If you\u2019re a foreign leader you have to realize if you try to butter up Trump it doesn\u2019t really matter, it\u2019s a one-way street.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s likely Emmanuel Macron is now well aware of this unfortunate dynamic."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "What does the Clinton scandal tell us about the Mueller investigation?", "description": "Leon Neyfakh, staff writer at Slate and co-producer and host of their hit podcast \"Slow Burn,\" and Yahoo News Chief Investigative Correspondent Michael Isikoff join Craig Melvin to discuss why we keep revisiting the Clinton scandal two decades later.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/craig-melvin/watch/what-does-the-clinton-scandal-tell-us-about-the-mueller-investigation-1370437699562", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/n_melvin_slowburn_181114_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:39:05Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "49ers host Paradise High School football team in wake of wildfires", "description": "As wildfires continue to ravage California, the San Francisco 49ers gave the Paradise High School football team something to smile about.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/craig-melvin/watch/49ers-host-paradise-high-school-football-team-in-wake-of-wildfires-1370422339980", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/n_melvin_smile_181114_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:27:36Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "49ers host Paradise High School football team in wake of wildfires copied!\n\nAs wildfires continue to ravage California, the San Francisco 49ers gave the Paradise High School football team something to smile about.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Jenna Bush-Hager sits down with Michelle Obama to discuss new book", "description": "Former First Lady Michelle Obama is setting the record straight, as she promotes her new book \"Becoming.\" Today she spoke to NBC's Jenna Bush Hager, who joined Craig Melvin to talk about the special bond between their two families.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/craig-melvin/watch/jenna-bush-hager-sits-down-with-michelle-obama-to-discuss-new-book-1370419267907", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/n_melvin_michelle_181114_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:21:16Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Jenna Bush-Hager sits down with Michelle Obama to discuss new book copied!\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama is setting the record straight, as she promotes her new book \"Becoming.\" Today she spoke to NBC's Jenna Bush Hager, who joined Craig Melvin to talk about the special bond between their two families.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Omarosa talks potential White House staffing shake up", "description": "Omarosa Manigault Newman, former director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison at the White House, joins Craig Melvin to discuss possible staffing changes in the White House and the new reporting on President Trump\u2019s mood after the midterms.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/craig-melvin/watch/omarosa-manigault-newman-talks-potential-white-house-staffing-shake-up-1370417731770", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/n_melvin_omarosa_181114_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:17:49Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Omarosa Manigault Newman talks potential White House staffing shake up copied!\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman, former director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison at the White House, joins Craig Melvin to discuss possible staffing changes in the White House and the new reporting on President Trump\u2019s mood after the midterms.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MPX", "title": "First lady calls for firing of national security aide", "description": "Melania Trump\u2019s office on Tuesday publicly called for the firing of senior National Security Council official, Mira Ricardel.

As things stand, it\u2019s the only state that can make that boast.\n\n* As of this morning, the Democratic lead in the U.S. House popular vote stood at 7.1%, though it may yet inch higher.

The party\u2019s term-limits policy prevented Cornyn from keeping his post.\n\n* Orientation is currently underway for new senators, and Florida\u2019s Rick Scott (R) is participating, despite the fact that the votes in his race are still being counted.

In the days leading up to Election Day, the chatter in GOP circles was that the party might be able to eke out a narrow House majority. As recently as Nov. 3, Vice President Mike Pence declared, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hold our Republican majority in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nWhere exactly were those intra-party expectations about Republicans suffering their largest losses since the Watergate era?\n\nBut even putting this aside, the idea that the GOP\u2019s tax breaks for the wealthy \u201cmade a huge difference\u201d for Republicans is an even stranger argument.\n\nWe can say with quantifiable certainty that the party\u2019s tax plan was woefully unpopular among voters, prompting Republican officials and candidates to run away from the issue before voters headed to the polls.\n\nBrady\u2019s larger point seems to be that the policy was politically important in less obvious ways: tax breaks boosted the economy, the argument goes, which meant many voters were less eager for change, which in turn boosted Republican incumbents who might\u2019ve otherwise been defeated.\n\nIt\u2019s tough thing to prove either way. That said, the economy isn\u2019t much different than it was in 2015 \u2013 in fact, job growth is actually slower now than it was three years ago \u2013 so the idea that tax cuts for the wealthy served as rocket fuel for the economy is dubious, at best.\n\nThe fact that Brady is pushing these talking points isn\u2019t too surprising. After all, it\u2019s not realistic to think one of the key architects of the Republican tax plan would stand before reporters and declare, \u201cI guess we did the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nBut if there\u2019s evidence of the tax plan helping the GOP in the midterms, it\u2019s hiding well."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "On stage each night, Cranston is 'mad as hell'", "description": "What is it like for actor Bryan Cranston to portray each night in front of a live audience a television anchor who's been fired from his job?

That deficit was the fifth largest in modern American history \u2013 in non-inflation adjusted terms \u2013 and stood at 3.9% of GDP, up from 3.5% a year prior.\n\nFor those concerned with the ballooning budget shortfall, the new fiscal year isn\u2019t off to a good start. Bloomberg News reported yesterday:\n\nThe U.S. recorded a $100.5 billion budget deficit in October, an increase of about 60 percent from a year earlier, as spending grew twice as fast as revenue. The deficit widened from $63.2 billion in the same month last year, the department said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. October marks the start of the U.S. fiscal year.\n\nAs a rule, it\u2019s best not to overreact to monthly deficit numbers, which can bounce around a bit. The fact that the deficit was $100 billion in the first month of the fiscal year, for example, does not necessarily mean that it will be $1.2 trillion when the fiscal year ends.\n\nThat said, the $100 billion deficit in October doesn\u2019t do any favors for the Republicans who assured Americans that massive tax breaks for the wealthy will pay for themselves.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as Democrats prepare to reclaim their majority in the House of Representatives, the monthly shortfall also serves as a fitting coda to the Tea Party era.\n\nIn 2010, Republicans rode a wave into a House majority, fueled by Tea Party activism and a focus on \u201cfiscal responsibility.\u201d GOP officials and candidates said at the time that they were deeply concerned about the deficit \u201ccrisis,\u201d which would impose crippling burdens on future generations.\n\nEight years later, in the month before the midterm elections that would push them into minority status, House Republicans saw the deficit reach $100 billion, fueled in part by tax breaks they didn\u2019t even try to pay for.\n\nThe \u201cmovement,\u201d such as it was, failed.\n\nPostscript: Every time we discuss the deficit, I feel compelled to point out again that I\u2019m not a deficit hawk, and I firmly believe that larger deficits, under some circumstances, are absolutely worthwhile and necessary.\n\nThese are not, however, those circumstances. When the economy is in trouble, it makes sense for the United States to borrow more, invest more, cushion the blow, and help strengthen the economy.\n\nThe Trump White House and the Republican-led Congress, however, decided to approve massive tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations when the economy was already healthy \u2013 not because they were addressing a policy need, but because they were fulfilling an ideological goal.\n\nAnd now that the deficit is spiraling, those same Republicans have decided that what the nation really needs is more tax breaks \u2013 none of which will be paid for \u2013 and cuts to Medicare and Social Security."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "Steve Benen", "title": "Iowa governor discovers her Steve King concerns at a convenient time", "description": "Last week, King was Kim Reynolds' campaign co-chair, whom she campaigned alongside just days before Election Day.

Kim Reynolds (R) recently found herself in an awkward position. As Election Day approached, polls showed the Republican governor narrowly behind her Democratic challenger in a year where Dems appeared likely to make gains in this Midwestern swing state.\n\nComplicating matters, Reynolds\u2019 campaign co-chair was right-wing Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), whose racist antics were drawing fire from within their party. If the governor denounced her ally, she risked alienating parts of the GOP base. If Reynolds voiced support for King, she risked alienating mainstream voters offended by the congressman\u2019s conduct.\n\nThe Iowa governor\u2019s solution? She tried to avoid King\u2019s mess and hoped voters would back her anyway. The strategy may have ruined Kim Reynolds\u2019 chances of ever winning a Profile in Courage Award, but it was enough to win the election: the governor prevailed by three points over Fred Hubbell (D).\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, now that the race is over, Reynolds feels empowered to show the kind of courage she was afraid to show before Iowans cast their ballots. The Des Moines Register reported yesterday:\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signaled Tuesday she\u2019s lost her patience with U.S. Rep. Steve King, who narrowly won a ninth term in the U.S. House last week despite a firestorm of criticism for aligning himself with far-right European politicians and repeatedly making remarks many have deemed racist. Reynolds, a Republican who defeated Democrat Fred Hubbell in a close race to win a full four-year term, offered a bluntly worded response when asked by a reporter if she had visited with King about a series of controversies he has been facing. Reynolds said she hasn\u2019t talked with the Iowa congressman because she has been busy since the election. But, she added, \u201cI think that Steve King needs to make a decision if he wants to represent the people and the values of the 4th District or do something else, and I think he needs to take a look at that.\u201d\n\nThis was apparently the most forceful Reynolds has been to date in her criticisms of the right-wing congressman. And while King\u2019s detractors will likely welcome the governor\u2019s comments, her timing is extraordinarily convenient.\n\nLast week, Steve King was Reynolds\u2019 campaign co-chair, whom she campaigned alongside just days before Election Day. This week, Reynolds isn\u2019t sure Steve King properly represents the values of his constituents in western Iowa.\n\nRemember, the week before Election Day, some GOP leaders were prepared to effectively cut King loose. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) publicly denounced the Iowan\u2019s \u201cracist\u201d antics, adding, \u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior.\u201d\n\nKim Reynolds could\u2019ve said something similar at the time. Instead, the governor waited until her criticisms couldn\u2019t hurt her own ambitions."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "De Blasio: NYC drove a hard bargain with Amazon", "description": "This week, Amazon announced its second headquarters would be located in the Long Island City area of Queens in New York City and in Virginia.

After skipping a ceremony honoring fallen American soldiers who served in World War I, he blamed his aides \u201cfor not counseling him that skipping the cemetery visit would be a public-relations nightmare.\u201d\n\nBut to fully appreciate the level of dysfunction in this White House, consider the fact that First Lady Melania Trump is getting involved in national security personnel decisions.\n\nIn an extraordinary move for a first lady, Melania Trump\u2019s office on Tuesday publicly called for the firing of a senior National Security Council official. Stephanie Grisham, the first lady\u2019s communications director issued a statement around 2:30 p.m. saying the official, Mira Ricardel, should no longer serve as the NSC\u2019s No. 2. \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nThat was weird, though the story got a little weirder.\n\nAfter Melania Trump\u2019s office publicly called for the ouster of the deputy national security adviser, a variety of news organizations reported that Mira Ricardel had, in fact, been fired. The West Wing soon after pushed back, insisting Ricardel was still in her position, working at her desk.\n\nWhile the back and forth was confusing, we weren\u2019t just dealing with rumors and off-the-record leaks: the First Lady really did issue an official statement calling for Ricardel\u2019s firing \u2013 a statement that, as of last night, the White House hadn\u2019t acted upon.\n\nIn case this isn\u2019t obvious, it\u2019s extraordinarily unusual for a president\u2019s spouse to try to exert influence over national security personnel decisions. It\u2019s nearly as odd for a First Lady to call for an aide\u2019s ouster, only to have nothing happen.\n\nLet\u2019s also note for context that Ricardel is the top deputy for National Security Adviser John Bolton \u2013 who, it just so happens, was out of the country yesterday when Melania Trump issued her statement.\n\nI can\u2019t say with any confidence how much longer Ricardel\u2019s career in the Trump administration will last \u2013 according to multiple accounts, she has more than a few detractors on Team Trump \u2013 but the fact that this drama is happening at all is indicative of a presidential operation that appears hopelessly lost."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Ex-CIA officer pens 'How to Get Rid of a President'", "description": "David Priess is a former CIA officer, and he joins Morning Joe to discuss his new book 'How to Get Rid of a President' and what he learned from briefing Robert Mueller.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/ex-cia-officer-pens-how-to-get-rid-of-a-president-1370240067763", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/n_mj_priess_181114_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:14:54Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Ex-CIA officer pens 'How to Get Rid of a President' copied!\n\nDavid Priess is a former CIA officer, and he joins Morning Joe to discuss his new book 'How to Get Rid of a President' and what he learned from briefing Robert Mueller.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "Steve Benen", "title": "In non-satirical piece, McConnell stresses virtues of bipartisanship", "description": "McConnell believes Dems are \"more interested in fanning the flames of division.\" If he doesn't want to be laughed at, he should try a less ridiculous message.", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/non-satirical-piece-mcconnell-stresses-virtues-bipartisanship", "urlToImage": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/gettyimages-482926760.jpg?itok=QLwu369h", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:00:16Z", "content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), reflecting on the results of the midterm elections, apparently thought it\u2019d be a good idea to write an op-ed on his perspective.

[\u2026] And looking ahead to the coming year, there will be no shortage of opportunities to continue this impressive record of cooperation across the aisle and across the Capitol. What we can make of those opportunities will depend on our Democratic colleagues. Will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? Or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference? [\u2026] After years of rhetoric, it\u2019s hardly news that some are more interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle.\n\nFor the record, McConnell didn\u2019t appear to be kidding.\n\nTaken at face value, stripped of any context or history, the Senate majority leader\u2019s rhetoric may seem like an olive branch of sorts. The week after Americans elected a Democratic-led House and a Republican-led Senate, there was Mitch McConnell stressing the virtues of \u201cbipartisanship,\u201d \u201cworking together,\u201d and \u201creaching across the aisle.\u201d What could possibly be wrong with that?\n\nThe answer lies in everything we know about the senior senator from Kentucky.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of a column the Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank wrote last year, describing McConnell as the politician who effectively \u201cbroke America.\u201d\n\nNo man has done more in recent years to undermine the functioning of U.S. government. His has been the epitome of unprincipled leadership, the triumph of tactics in service of short-term power. [\u2026] McConnell is no idiot. He is a clever man who does what works for him in the moment, consequences be damned.\n\nAs we discussed in detail at the time, whether one finds McConnell\u2019s work outrageous is a matter of perspective. If you\u2019re a myopic Republican partisan, the GOP\u2019s Senate leader has simply taken every possible opportunity to maximize his party\u2019s interests, using the levers of power at his disposal. McConnell, to the best of my knowledge, hasn\u2019t committed any crimes in his partisan pursuits, so much as he\u2019s pushed the limits in ways without precedent in the American tradition, ignoring any sense of norms or institutional limits.\n\nAnd to that end, McConnell has been quite successful.\n\nBut if you\u2019re not a myopic Republican partisan, and your principal concern is with the health of the American political system, McConnell\u2019s work has earned him a role as one of this generation\u2019s most consequential villains.\n\nIt was McConnell who changed Senate norms to require 60-vote supermajorities on every piece of legislation of any significance. It was McConnell who was responsible for creating the modern judicial confirmation wars. It was McConnell who spearheaded every recent attempt to derail campaign-finance reforms.\n\nIt was McConnell who cooked up an unprecedented scorched-earth scheme to undermine Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, deliberately refusing to consider any compromises \u2013 even if it meant rejecting his own ideas \u2013 in the hopes of trying to ensure that the Democratic president only served one term.\n\nIt was McConnell who imposed the first-ever, year-long blockade on any Supreme Court nominee. It was McConnell who was warned about Russia\u2019s illegal attack on the American election last year, only to scuttle efforts to address the crisis in the hopes of putting Moscow\u2019s candidate in the Oval Office.\n\nIt was McConnell who decided to shift with the political winds in order to advance his partisan crusade. Milbank added, \u201c[M]ost characteristic of McConnell is his tendency to shift his views to suit current exigencies (on the minimum wage, withdrawal from Iraq, earmarks, abortion, labor and civil rights) and his adroitness at gumming up the works: forcing clerks to spend hours reading a bill aloud on the floor; opposing immigration legislation he\u2019d encouraged; asking for a vote on a debt-ceiling proposal and then trying to filibuster it; urging the Obama administration to support a bipartisan debt commission and then voting against it.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t about issues or ideology, per se. My point isn\u2019t that McConnell is on the right, and I\u2019m on the left, so I\u2019m opposed to his vision and preferred policies. Rather, we\u2019re talking about politics on an institutional level. We can evaluate the Kentucky Republican\u2019s views on given issues on a case-by-case basis, but what makes McConnell so destructive is how he\u2019s pursued his priorities, not the priorities themselves.\n\nI don\u2019t blame McConnell for considering partisan advantage important; I blame him for prioritizing partisan advantage above literally every other consideration, including the health and sustainability of our political system. I\u2019m not bothered by his victories; I\u2019m bothered by what those victories have cost.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that McConnell took his pitch to Fox News, arguing that he believes Democrats are \u201cmore interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle.\u201d\n\nIf the Senate majority leader doesn\u2019t want to be laughed at, perhaps he should try a less ridiculous message."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Troops deployed to border is a 'stunt', says Sen.
