The president said he \u201cmay be\u201d willing to do exactly that. His answer then meandered to complaining about Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, the Clinton Foundation, and his success in \u201cterminating a lot of the Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBut Trump then added this gem:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget, I didn\u2019t really have a majority. I had one senator. And I had a few Republicans in the House. You know, a very small number.\u201d\n\nThe week after Election Day 2016, when it became clear that Republicans would control all of the levers of federal power for a while, the Washington Post published a piece documenting \u201cjust how dominant Republicans are in America\u201d heading into 2017.\n\nA few days later, Real Clear Politics declared that the Republican Party was, in the wake of Trump\u2019s election, \u201cthe strongest it\u2019s been in 80 years.\u201d\n\nThat was two years ago this week. Now, Trump reflects on the landscape, and thinks Republicans \u201cdidn\u2019t really have a majority.\u201d\n\nIn reality, they did. It was a modest majority in the Senate \u2013 the GOP started 2017 with 52 seats \u2013 but it was a more robust majority in the House. To hear the president tell it, the Republican majority in the lower chamber was \u201ca few\u201d seats. As this Congress got underway, the House GOP majority stood at 241 seats \u2013 which is a 23-seat majority.\n\nWhat I think Trump is looking for is an excuse. When he runs for re-election, some are likely to ask him why he has so few accomplishments, especially given the fact that his party controlled the House and Senate for the first two years of his presidency.\n\nTrump\u2019s explanation may seem ridiculous, but he\u2019s repeating it anyway: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I didn\u2019t really have a majority.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Trump blames fire deaths on 'gross mismanagement'", "description": "Donald Trump blamed and threatened Californians as they deal with record-breaking wildfires, tweeting in part, \"so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.\"", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/trump-blames-fire-deaths-on-gross-mismanagement-1371701315521", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/n_hayes_gtrumpfire_181115_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:37:32Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Trump blames fire deaths on 'gross mismanagement' copied!\n\nDonald Trump blamed and threatened Californians as they deal with record-breaking wildfires, tweeting in part, \"so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.\"\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Betrayal: The Plot That Won the White House", "description": "A bitter race for the White House.

So the United States deployed thousands of troops for an operation that will cost taxpayers \u201cat least $220 million\u201d by the end of the year.

Asked about possible nominees, Trump immediately insisted that his acting A.G., Matthew Whitaker, is \u201ca very respected man.\u201d\n\nBut as the president\u2019s answer continued to unfold, Trump ended up accidentally telling the truth about what was on his mind.\n\n\u201cI knew [Matt Whitaker] only as he pertained, you know, as he was with Jeff Sessions. And, you know, look, as far as I\u2019m concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had. \u201cIt\u2019s something that should have never been brought. It\u2019s an illegal investigation. And you know, it\u2019s very interesting because when you talk about not Senate confirmed, well, Mueller\u2019s not Senate confirmed. \u201cHe\u2019s heading this whole big thing, he\u2019s not Senate confirmed. So anyway\u2026.\u201d\n\nIn case there\u2019s any ambiguity, when Trump referenced the \u201cinvestigation,\u201d he was referring to the investigation into the Russia scandal. Mueller, of course, referred to Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe Daily Caller\u2019s question, however, had nothing to do with the scandal or the ongoing probe. The reporter asked about Whitaker and the search for a new attorney general nominee.\n\nIt was Trump who heard that question and immediately started connecting Whitaker\u2019s appointment to the president\u2019s belief that the Mueller investigation is \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nIn other words, some of the White House\u2019s critics have spent the last week making the case that Trump chose Whitaker because both Republicans oppose the special counsel\u2019s probe. And yesterday, the president suggested that his critics are right, and that Whitaker\u2019s appointment is about Mueller.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Trump has incriminated himself the same way before. In an interview with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt last year, the president famously connected James Comey\u2019s firing to the investigation into the Russia scandal.\n\nMore recently, Trump admitted to Fox News that the pre-election hush money in 2016 came directly from him.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think professional interviewers got the president to admit something he didn\u2019t intend to say, but in each of these instances, Trump simply blurted out incriminating thoughts that happened to be on his mind.\n\nIf his critics are lucky, the president will keep doing interviews like these."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MPX", "title": "All In 11/14/18", "description": "Chris Hayes discusses the day's top political news.", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/all/episodes/watch/all-in-11-14-18-episode", "urlToImage": "https://tve-static-msnbc.akamaized.net/j/image/897/587/181109_3827607_All_In_11_14_18_anvver_1_800x450_1371450435684.video_1067x600.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:21:00Z", "content": "All In with Chris Hayes 11/14/18 Chris Hayes discusses the day's top political news. descriptionLimit\"&gt;... more Duration: {{video.duration.momentjs}} Up next in: All In full episodes", "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "Steve Benen", "title": "Why the arguments against Nancy Pelosi fall short", "description": "Nancy Pelosi's Democratic detractors are trying to argue she shouldn't be Speaker.

Some of those assumptions, however, may have been premature.\n\nThe Washington Post reported overnight:\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday faced solid opposition from at least 17 Democrats and encountered a significant bloc of undecided women in her bid for speaker, setting the stage for an intense battle over who will ascend to one of the most powerful positions in Washington. After a campaign in which some Democrats prevailed in competitive districts by promising to oppose her, a coalition of incumbents and newly elected members have denied her a smooth path to the speakership.\n\nPelosi and her allies are confident that she\u2019ll prevail. The Californian\u2019s Democratic detractors are confident they\u2019ll block her path. They can\u2019t both be right.\n\nThe drama is likely to intensify between now and the official vote on Jan. 3, but in the meantime, it\u2019s worth pausing to question why in the world Pelosi\u2019s ascension isn\u2019t automatic.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on his, but Pelosi is one of the most skilled and accomplished legislators in a generation. We tend to name buildings after congressional leaders with her kind of record. The list of Barack Obama\u2019s accomplishments is long, but for those who watch Capitol Hill closely, it\u2019s no secret that many of the former president\u2019s successes would not have happened were it not for the efficacy of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s leadership \u2013 on issues ranging from health care to civil rights to the economy.\n\nOrdinarily, when a party looks to make dramatic changes to its congressional leadership, there\u2019s an easily identifiable reason. Maybe a party leader gets caught up in a scandal. Maybe he or she suffered an embarrassing series of failures. Maybe, under his or her leadership, the party just suffered a brutal electoral setback, prompting rank-and-file members to look for a major directional shift.\n\nNone of this applies to Pelosi. She\u2019s had no scandals. She\u2019s made no major legislative mistakes. She\u2019s led a House Democratic caucus that just saw its greatest gains since the immediate aftermath of the Watergate scandal nearly a half-century ago.\n\nAll of which leads to the question of what\u2019s motivating her intra-party critics. Some have stuck to the line, for example, that it\u2019s \u201ctime for a change.\u201d That may or may not be true, but it\u2019s not really an argument, per se. It\u2019s incumbent on proponents to explain why there should be a change, who would lead the change, and how it would be better than the alternative. So far, on this front, anti-Pelosi Dems have fallen short.\n\nAnother line from this contingent is that Republicans have succeeded in making Pelosi \u201ctoxic,\u201d making it necessary to find a new Democratic leader who\u2019d enjoy stronger public support. But this, too, is unpersuasive. For one thing, whomever House Dems chose would be the target of GOP attacks, and replacing Democratic leaders because Republicans don\u2019t like them is folly.\n\nFor another, the popularity of congressional leaders doesn\u2019t seem to have any real practical significance. Mitch McConnell is unpopular, too, but the Senate Republican majority is poised to grow. The right went after Nancy Pelosi with a vengeance throughout 2018 and House Dems added nearly 40 seats anyway.\n\nSo who cares what her approval rating is?\n\nFinally, I\u2019ve heard many Pelosi detractors point out that she\u2019s not a powerful media presence, and she\u2019s stronger as a behind-the-scenes legislative leader and negotiator than as a public spokesperson. There\u2019s some truth to this. But again, Paul Ryan has long been a media darling \u2013 whose list of legislative accomplishments fits comfortably on a bar napkin and whose party just lost its House majority.\n\nPelosi is good at this job. We know this to be true because we\u2019ve seen her succeed at it. Common sense suggests House Democrats should be urging her to seek the Speaker\u2019s gavel, not looking for ways to keep it out of her hands.\n\nPostscript: As the process unfolds, keep an eye on some of the procedural tactics. The next big step will be members of the House Democratic caucus formally choosing a nominee for Speaker on Nov. 28. If Pelosi enjoys the overwhelming support of Democratic members, and the faction opposing her withers soon after, that will be that.\n\nBut as I understand it, part of the push from anti-Pelosi Dems is the threat of a rebellion on the House floor. The next Speaker will need 218 votes, and her detractors are making it clear that they\u2019re prepared to oppose her, not just at the caucus meeting when the party chooses a nominee, but also during the floor vote.\n\nThe obvious analogy is a presidential nominating process: the anti-Pelosi Dems are effectively saying they\u2019re prepared to oppose their party\u2019s nominee during the \u201cprimary\u201d process, and if they don\u2019t get their way, they\u2019ll help defeat their party\u2019s choice in the \u201cgeneral election,\u201d too.\n\nWatch this space."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "#GoodNewsRUHLES: Welcome to the world, Baby O\u2019Neill!", "description": "Our MSNBC family just keeps growing!

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who leads the far-right House Freedom Caucus, on a regressive plan that gutted protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.\n\nPolitico soon after described MacArthur as the lawmaker who \u201csinglehandedly saved the Obamacare repeal effort.\u201d When the Republican bill passed the House, it was MacArthur who spoke at the (premature) White House celebration.\n\nThe fun didn\u2019t last. The Senate rejected the plan MacArthur helped negotiate; the president denounced the legislation as \u201cmean\u201d; MacArthur found it necessary to step down as chairman of the Tuesday Group for GOP moderates; and the backlash from people in New Jersey was intense.\n\nIn effect, the Republican congressman gambled his career on a radical health care plan that would\u2019ve hurt a lot of people.\n\nWe now know just how bad a bet that was."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "Steve Benen", "title": "Trump claims to know about 'the inner workings' of Mueller's probe", "description": "Last week, Mueller stopped reporting to Rod Rosenstein and started reporting to Matt Whitaker.

But in a pair of presidential tweets, Trump said something today that broke new ground.\n\n\u201cThe inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don\u2019t care how many lives the ruin. \u201cThese are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won\u2019t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\u201d\n\nAt this point, there are all sorts of things we could focus on. We could note the irony of this president, whose White House is beset by chaos, accusing others of running a messy operation. We could explain that Robert Mueller, in reality, has no meaningful conflicts of interest. We could note that Mueller actually served as FBI director for eight years under George W. Bush, and stayed on for four more years under Barack Obama.\n\nBut as interesting as those tidbits may be, let\u2019s not miss the forest for the trees. According to Trump, he now has knowledge about the \u201cinner workings\u201d of the special counsel\u2019s team and their probe.\n\nAnd how, pray tell, does the president know anything about the inner workings of the Mueller investigation?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the president has been having direct conversations \u2013 of dubious propriety \u2013 with witnesses who\u2019ve spoken to investigators. It\u2019s also possible that Trump himself is one of the people who feels as if he\u2019s been \u201cthreatened\u201d by Team Mueller, so Trump can speak with first-hand knowledge about investigators\u2019 \u201canger.\u201d\n\nWe also shouldn\u2019t discount the possibility that Trump has simply made all of this up; he doesn\u2019t know anything about the \u201cinner workings\u201d of the investigation; and his tweets were based solely on details cooked up in the president\u2019s odd imagination.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the other possibility: Trump appointed Matt Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general last week, and in that capacity, Whitaker \u2013 a Republican loyalist and staunch critic of Mueller\u2019s probe \u2013 has direct oversight authority over the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nIn other words, last week, Mueller stopped reporting to Rod Rosenstein and started reporting to Matt Whitaker. Eight days later, for the first time, Trump told the public he has new insights into the \u201cinner workings\u201d of the special counsel\u2019s efforts.\n\nMaybe the timing is coincidental. Then again, maybe it\u2019s not."}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Piers Morgan: Trump could've shown empathy for California", "description": "British PM Theresa May said on Wednesday evening that her cabinet had agreed to accept a fragile draft Brexit deal with the European Union.

Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It\u2019s really a disgrace what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to say there\u2019s \u201cno evidence\u201d to support such nonsense, but in this case, that won\u2019t cut it. Even Republicans who peddle absurd voter-fraud claims don\u2019t believe illegal ballots are being cast by people in disguises. For the president to say out loud that this is \u201cwhat\u2019s going on\u201d is plainly bonkers, even by 2018 standards.\n\nBut it\u2019s Trump\u2019s remedy that stood out.\n\nIn another part of the Daily Caller interview, Trump made a case for a national voter ID law that would purportedly solve the problem of voter impersonation. \u201cIf you buy a box of cereal \u2013 you have a voter ID,\u201d he said. \u201cThey try to shame everybody by calling them racist, or calling them something, anything they can think of, when you say you want voter ID. But voter ID is a very important thing.\u201d\n\nOh good, the president has made the transition from \u201cserial liar\u201d to \u201ccereal liar.\u201d\n\nAs anyone who\u2019s ever bought cereal probably knows, the purchases do not require photo ID. It is, however, not the first time Trump has made this mistake.\n\nAt a rally in Florida in July, the Republican declared, \u201cYou know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card, you need ID.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, this generated a fair amount of mockery \u2013 and yet, here we are again.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s dismissal of claims that voter-ID laws are inherently racist, the president may find the evidence inconvenient, but the truth matters. As the Washington Post noted, \u201cVoter ID laws disproportionately make it more difficult for people of color to vote. The laws are usually passed by Republican legislatures in part because they tamp down a voting base assumed to support Democrats. In the past, courts have explicitly called voter ID laws in Texas and North Carolina discriminatory.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "msnbc", "name": "MSNBC"}, "author": "MSNBC.com", "title": "Richard Ojeda slams border 'stunt,' plots 2020 bid", "description": "After losing his Democratic congressional bid in West Virginia, Richard Ojeda, a retired Army major, announces run for presidency.

That\u2019s when Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) did something interesting\n\nAs Rachel explained on the show last night, Flake\u2019s gambit puts at risk 21 Trump judicial nominees currently pending in the Judiciary Committee \u2013 where Republicans have an 11-to-10 majority \u2013 and an additional 32 judicial nominees awaiting confirmation on the Senate floor.\n\nThere are very few things Mitch McConnell and his leadership team care more about than confirming the White House\u2019s far-right judges, which means Flake no doubt captured the GOP leadership\u2019s attention yesterday afternoon.\n\nThe question, of course, is what happens now.\n\nMcConnell has a few options. He could, for example, simply wait until January: Flake is retiring; his congressional career will wrap up in a couple of months; and an even-larger Senate GOP majority can get right back to work stacking the federal judiciary in the new Congress. With Democrats reclaiming the House majority, Republicans in the upper chamber won\u2019t have that much to do anyway.\n\nThe Senate majority leader could also placate Flake in an inconsequential way. The Arizonan didn\u2019t threaten to block judicial nominees until the Mueller bill became law, but rather, until it received a vote in the Senate. It\u2019s not hard to imagine McConnell meeting Flake\u2019s demand, holding a vote, and letting it die soon after in the House.\n\nOr McConnell could simply help the bill become law. This strikes me as the least likely of the options.\n\nIf Flake\u2019s gambit sounds at all familiar, it\u2019s because he did something similar in July, announcing plans to block judicial nominees until his concerns over Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs were addressed. The Arizonan was placated rather easily \u2013 the Senate passed a largely symbolic resolution \u2013 and Flake folded soon after.\n\nWill he be a little more assertive playing hardball this time around?
