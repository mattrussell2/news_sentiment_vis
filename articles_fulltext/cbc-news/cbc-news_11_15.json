Ninety per cent of those get jobs in under a year and nearly that amount end up staying in Manitoba permanently. A ceremony Thursday at the legislature celebrated two decades of the program.\n\nRecently, the PC government added a $500 fee to the program to clear a backlog of thousands of applicants and enhance the service.\n\nHipolito Alibin, or JR as he likes to be called, is an accountant by trade and is the family member responsible for the financial side of the restaurant expanding to Winnipeg. He says the steady growth of the Filipino community in Manitoba made the province attractive to the Manilla-based chain.\n\n\"It has become an organic market for Max's to come here, really. It was just natural and our family recognized it a few years ago,\" Alibin told CBC News in the parking lot next to the restaurant's location on St. James Street.\n\nMax's Restaurant location will employ more than 50 people and open early in 2019. (Lyzaville Sale/CBC) A population of over 80,000 Filipinos in the city wasn't quite enough to close the deal though, says Alibin.\n\nSeveral years ago executives at Max's Restaurant (one of the oldest and most successful in the Philippines) had expanded to cities in Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia and then ran into a snag. The federal government had clawed back foreign work permits, and it became difficult to attract Filipinos to work in the restaurants.\n\nA key to the success of the chain outside the Philippines was to have expatriate staff cook and serve the traditional meals.\n\nFormer Manitoba premier Gary Filmon launched a seven-year effort for a Manitoba immigration program after realizing the federal government didn't understand the province's labour needs. (Justin Fraser/CBC) The Alibin family, however, had an ace in their pocket when they made their pitch to Max's people.\n\nManitoba had a highly successful, long-standing nominee program that was bringing thousands of Filipinos to the province every year.\n\n\"For Max's company, that has been a big factor. And that's why they said, 'Yes, let's go ahead. Let's go to Winnipeg,'\" Alibin said.\n\nNow, the Alibin family has leased a brand-new building in the Polo Park area and will hire at least 50 staff in anticipation of opening in early 2019.\n\nMPNP's journey didn't start in Manitoba: Filmon\n\nAt the Manitoba legislature Thursday, the provincial government held a celebration to mark the 20th year of the program and invited former premier Gary Filmon to speak at the event.\n\nFor the one-time Progressive Conservative premier an eye-opener came while touring overseas on trade missions.\n\nInvariably when speaking to trade representatives and economic development staff at Canadian embassies all over the world Filmon discovered a complete lack of knowledge about Manitoba's economy.\n\nThe pervasive impression of this province was it was an agriculturally-based economy and it forced Filmon to explain that financial services, manufacturing and other industries led the way. And led Filmon to conclude Manitoba needed its own way of attracting immigrants to feed the growth.\n\n\"They didn't know what our needs were,\" Filmon told a packed audience at the Rotunda of the legislature.\n\nAn opening to wiggle some control on immigration from Ottawa came after Quebec had been awarded similar powers after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord. The federal government gave that province the right to select immigrants based on their knowledge of French.\n\nFilmon had other ideas in mind. Immigrants who could have a direct impact on Manitoba's labour needs, but Ottawa wasn't of a mind to give Manitoba similar powers.\n\nFilmon says it was tantamount to federal bureaucrats and politicians throwing \"gravel into the workings of government\" and a seven-year-long skirmish began, involving ministers from his PC government and subsequently two from NDP regimes.\n\nUltimately, Manitoba prevailed and in 1998 the deal was signed, allowing the province to develop a path that 65 per cent of immigrants coming here now chose to take.\n\nFilmon, whose ancestors on both sides of his family are immigrants, is pleased to see the program so successful and gratified it continues.\n\n\"We can go around this room and find the stories of everyone. They are the children and grandchildren and great grandchildren of immigrants, and they have changed and transformed our province and made it strong for the future,\" Filmon told the audience.\n\nWe can go around this room and find the stories of everyone. They are the children and grandchildren and great grandchildren of immigrants, and they have changed and transformed our province and made it strong for the future. - Former Manitoba premier Gary Filmon\n\nThey are words the Alibin family seem to embrace.\n\nFrank Alibin, in charge of IT and marketing for the Max's Restaurant, has children he's proud to say have grown up in Winnipeg. The whole family's arrival in the province starts from an aunt who arrived in the city in the late 60s to work in the garment industry.\n\nNow, the family's restaurant venture is a chance to link their new roots in Manitoba to a country they once called home.\n\n\"The kids, they are born and raised here. I want them to have and keep that Filipino culture in them. They love Winnipeg, and they love Canada, but I don't want my kids to forget where they came from,\" Alibin said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Coast guard en route to help carrier in distress off Newfoundland coast", "description": "The Centennial Harmony was experiencing flooding in 20-metre swells, but the crew has since gained control of the ship and is awaiting help from rescue teams.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/centennial-harmony-distress-1.4908039", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2035864.1381643574!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/li-sir-wilfred-grenfell-460.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:49:37Z", "content": "A bulk carrier stranded 250 nautical miles southeast of St. John's is safe for now after battling power outages and flooding earlier this afternoon.

The fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized, therefore we thought it was best to move on as any other outcome would have been unfair to him.\"\n\nAnthony was traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Atlanta Hawks in July before the Hawks released him to clear the way for him to sign with the Rockets.\n\nHouston thought he could be the piece it needed to finally get past Golden State and win its first championship since back-to-back titles in 1994-95. Instead the Rockets limped out to a 6-7 start and the emergence of undrafted rookie Gary Clark made it appear that Anthony would have to take a reduced role.\n\nIn the end the Rockets decided it would be better to move on than to force Anthony to do that.\n\n\"We just had to see how things worked out,\" D'Antoni said. \"And the way we play probably wasn't conducive to his game and he was trying to make the necessary sacrifices and it wasn't fair to him as a Hall of Fame player to play in a way that wasn't good for him, wasn't good for us. It just wasn't a fit.\"\n\nReserve role doesn't fit\n\nThe 34-year-old Anthony is a 10-time All-Star who has had a tough time over the last two seasons. He averaged a career-low 16.2 points in 78 starts in a tumultuous season for the Thunder last season before coming to Houston \u2014 and accepting a reserve role for the first time in his 16-year career.\n\nEight of Anthony's 10 appearances for the Rockets came off the bench after he had started all 1,054 games he'd played in his first 15 NBA seasons.\n\nD'Antoni said he feels for Anthony that things ended this way and made it clear that it wasn't a matter of Anthony not having the right attitude in Houston.\n\n\"In the summer we tried to hit a home run and it didn't work out,\" D'Antoni said. \"He tried everything he could. He was great while he was here. It just didn't work out for whatever reason. I just thank him for his professionalism. It was good. He tried everything he could to make it work and it just didn't work out.\"\n\nThe third overall pick in the 2003 draft has averaged 24 points, 6.5 rebounds and 3 assists in a career that also included stints with the Denver Nuggets and the New York Knicks.\n\nAnthony sat out Houston's last three games with what the team called an illness. His last appearance for Houston came in a blowout loss to Oklahoma City on Nov. 8 when he had two points and five rebounds.\n\nD'Antoni expects the rest of the Rockets to handle this professionally, but knows that the move will be tough on them.\n\n\"I'm sure they hate it,\" D'Antoni said. \"There's some good friends in there and there will be friendships. But above all this is a business.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Dave Dormer", "title": "Wind warnings issued for Calgary and surrounding area", "description": "\u201cThe wind will increase to 50 [km/hr] gusting 70 km/h shortly after midnight, however, at times gusts could be as strong as 90 km/h,\u201d reads a warning from Environment Canada.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-wind-warning-snowfall-1.4907998", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4908019.1542323370!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/calgary-wind-warning.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:28:20Z", "content": "A strong cold front is expected to move from north to south across the province Thursday night, bringing high winds along with freezing temperatures. \"The wind will increase to 50 [km/hr] gusting 70 km/h shortly after midnight, however, at times gusts could b\u2026 [+853 chars]", "fulltext": "A strong cold front is expected to move from north to south across the province Thursday night, bringing high winds along with freezing temperatures.\n\n\"The wind will increase to 50 [km/hr] gusting 70 km/h shortly after midnight, however, at times gusts could be as strong as 90 km/h,\" reads a warning from Environment Canada.\n\n\"The system will exit the province Friday morning and the wind will diminish.\"\n\nAs of 4 p.m., wind warnings are in place for the area of:\n\nAirdrie, Cochrane Olds.\n\nBrooks, Strathmore, Vulcan.\n\nCalgary.\n\nDrumheller, Three Hills.\n\nOkotoks, High River, Claresholm.\n\nSnowfall warnings were also issued for parts of western and central Alberta earlier in the day.\n\nCommunities from Grande Prairie to Rocky Mountain House, Hinton to Whitecourt, are being told to brace for a big winter storm.\n\nBetween 10 and 15 centimetres of snow are expected to fall before Friday morning, although some areas may get 20 centimetres.\n\nDrivers who do take to the highway are reminded to prepare for winter conditions, including reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces, and adjust their driving habits accordingly."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Man dies boating on Bow River near Okotoks", "description": "STARS Air Ambulance was dispatched to airlift the man to Foothills hospital in Calgary, where he was pronounced dead.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/missing-boater-bow-river-1.4907970", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4823257.1536975851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rcmp.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:27:44Z", "content": "A man died Thursday while boating on the Bow River near Okotoks.

The boy was a friend of one of his other victims.\n\nL.P. visited Coulombe's house several times to play video games. The teenager needed a new cell phone. Coulombe bought one for him, but then made L.P. feel indebted.

Many were duplicated and stored in different locations on hard drives. The total number of distinct images was 8,490.\n\nPolice also found 4,219 videos of recorded child sexual exploitation.

(CBC)\n\nThe Sartors say they were never told they were signing over title of their home and never agreed to sell the home.\n\nUltimately, and unbeknownst to the Sartors, the transfer was not allowed when the land registry office found the sale amount to be \"materially lower than the fair market value of the property.\"\n\nAfter paying approximately $14,400 to Boon for the next two years the couple say they received a bill totalling just over $8,000 for unpaid property taxes and a warning from the city that their home was about to be sold at a tax sale.\n\nWhen the Sartors paid the bill they learned about the offer to purchase and that Boon had registered a transfer of their title.\n\nThe couple stopped paying their monthly payments to Boon in 2008 after they filed their suit, arguing he had breached their agreement by not paying the property taxes.\n\nA Winnipeg woman is warning people who get behind on their mortgages and property taxes to be careful of anyone approaching them and offering help. 2:50\n\nThey have continued to live in the home during the years of court proceedings.\n\nBoon's counter-suit, launched in 2014, asked for a judgment of $71,316.44 from the Sartors and possession of the property, claiming the Sartors defaulted by stopping their payments.\n\nIn her decision Suche ordered the Sartors to pay Boon's numbered company the $27,830 remaining on their mortgage plus simple interest at 9.25 per cent.\n\n\"Admittedly, the Sartors were not entitled to stop making mortgage payments and self-help remedies are not to be encouraged,\" she wrote.\n\nNeither Boon nor the Sartors agreed to speak to CBC News.\n\nA history with the courts\n\nThe case is among several disputed real estate deals that have seen Boon and his Daylight Capital Corporation taken to court over the years.\n\nDozens of Winnipeg homeowners have transferred title of their homes to Boon and his associated companies for more than a decade. His business involves searching public land and tax registries to find people on the verge of losing their homes, then offering to lend them money.\n\nWhile it's not illegal for Boon to operate in this way, many of his clients, like the Sartors, have taken him to court to regain ownership of their homes.\n\nIn 2004, Gerhard and Lydia Storm were struggling to keep up with some mortgage payments \u2014 they had fallen behind on $4,000 in arrears \u2014 when they say they received a call from Richard Boon saying he could help. 5:38\n\nIn 2006 Manitoba's land registry office told CBC News Boon had talked 69 people into transferring ownership of their homes over to him in exchange for help paying their mortgages over the six previous years.\n\nThat year the land registry office simply stopped processing Boon's land transfers \u2014 preventing him from taking ownership \u2014 after determining many of Boon's clients didn't understand what they were doing.\n\nIn her decision Suche said she ordered Boon to pay damages in part to dissuade him and others from making similar deals in the future.\n\n\"The Sartors were very vulnerable and they were directly targeted by (Boon's) actions,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Nothing in the evidence suggests that Boon will face any other consequences for his actions, and he and others who might choose to engage in this kind of business practice need to be deterred.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Tim Reynolds", "title": "Brooke Henderson 10 shots back at Tour Championship", "description": "Amy Olson had a simple explanation for her brilliant start at the CME Group Tour Championship, while Brooke Henderson shot a 73 on Thursday and is 10 shots off the lead after the first round of LPGA Tour Championship in Naples, Fla.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/golf/lpga-tour-championship-first-round-brooke-henderson-1.4907844", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4907913.1542320306!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/henderson-brooke-lpga-111518-620.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:26:24Z", "content": "Amy Olson had a simple explanation for her brilliant start at the CME Group Tour Championship. \"I don't have any bad memories,\" she said.

If the order of finish Sunday were the same as it was when Thursday's play ended, Hataoka would walk off with the Globe.\n\nShe already has an idea how she wound spend the bonus.\n\n\"Seeing all the houses on the golf course really inspires me to want one of those,\" Hataoka said.\n\nThompson won the Globe last season \u2014 she's not in the group of 12 women with a mathematical chance of doing so this year \u2014 but has a pair of top-four finishes at the season finale in the last three years.

(National Energy Board)\n\nThe line is already under construction on the American side of the border. All told, it's expected to cost roughly $453 million and increase the province's electricity export capacity to 3185 MW from 2300 MW.\n\nHydro made its initial application for the project in December 2016. At the time, the Crown corporation expected to have approval by the end of August 2017 and to begin construction on the line in December 2017, in order to have the line in operation by May or June 2020.\n\nManitoba Hydro spokesperson Scott Powell said Thursday the utility is still working toward that goal, but completion is dependent on when it can secure licences.\n\nPowell said Hydro is happy with the NEB's recommendation.\n\nThat's a real positive step forward and we're pleased about that. - Manitoba Hydro spokesperson Scott Powell\n\n\"That's a real positive step forward and we're pleased about that.\"\n\nApproval subject to 28 conditions\n\nIn July, Ottawa officials accepted a board recommendation that the project go through the certificate process, meaning additional public hearings.\n\nHearings on the project wrapped up in June with cross examinations and final arguments from Manitoba Hydro and intervenor groups. The board heard from 17 intervenors and two letter-of-comment writers.\n\nThe approval is subject to 28 conditions related to consultation with Indigenous people, the environment, engineering standards and safety.\n\nBefore construction can begin, Manitoba Hydro needs to meet those conditions and secure the federal certificate \u2014 which may come with additional conditions \u2014 as well as a provincial licence and permits.\n\nRoughly 31 per cent of electricity generated in Manitoba is sold out-of-province, with the majority of it being exported to the United States, the board noted in its decision. Revenue from the project is expected to help lower the cost of electricity in the province, the board wrote, and its construction will enhance grid reliability for residents.\n\nGroup disappointed with decision\n\nThe board's conditions include a requirement for Hydro to file a plan to create a Landowner Advisory Committee, including a summary of how potentially-affected landowners and their representative organizations were consulted, as well as a summary of the consultations.\n\nThe project has been subject to criticism by property owners in southern Manitoba who protested the proposed route.\n\nKevin Toyne, lawyer for the Southeast Landowners Coalition, a group of landowners opposing the project, said he's not happy with the NEB's decision, which he characterized as prioritizing American interests over Manitobans.\n\nReally disappointed that the National Energy Board concluded that a project that will require hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize Minnesota's climate change plan as being in the public interest of Canada. - Kevin Toyne, lawyer for the Southeast Landowners Coalition\n\n\"Really disappointed that the National Energy Board concluded that a project that will require hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize Minnesota's climate change plan as being in the public interest of Canada,\" Toyne said. \"It's a real head scratcher.\"\n\nThe group still has opportunities to protest the project, he said.

Gallant argued that the \"new approach\" had worked out after all.\n\n\"This new approach helped us as a government make substantive changes to improve transparency and strengthen our economy,\" he said.\n\nBrian Gallant announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party. Now we look back at his time as leader. 0:55\n\nNever mind that the first example he cited \u2014 a ban on corporation and union donations to political parties \u2014 actually came to pass as a result of a Progressive Conservative amendment to a Liberal bill.\n\nIt seemed fair to ask: precisely how did he became more jaded as premier and fall into the adversarial ways of politics? How would he advise future party leaders to avoid that trap?\n\n\"I'll get all theoretical with you on what I think happens to a lot of people, not just myself,\" he answered.\n\nBut first, he took credit for less heckling in the legislature, a rule he imposed on his Liberal MLAs.\n\n\"That's improved a lot on the side of our caucus, and that's helped the tone,\" he said.\n\nPointing the finger\n\nThen, he indeed talked about \"a lot of people, not just myself\" \u2014 by blaming others for the cynicism that took hold of him.\n\nHe faulted the Progressive Conservatives, for example, for not going along with his \"new approach\" to be less partisan.\n\n\"When you try, if you're the only one, it's a bit difficult,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed to his first day in the house in 2013 as Opposition leader. He told the Liberal caucus that they would approach question period differently \u2014 not by attacking the PC government but by asking what they could do to help.\n\nHis MLAs were against the idea, Gallant said.\n\n\"They said we would just get 'thumped,' as they called it,\" he said. \"I said, 'No, no, it'll change the tone.' And we did that, and all the government of the day did was get up and start criticizing us.\"\n\nGallant also blamed the media for conflict-centric political coverage that rewards those who behave badly.\n\n\"Sometimes when there's an important issue, politicians feel they have to take on those adversarial ways to get a bit of attention,\" he said.\n\n\"That certainly fuels that cycle a little bit, but it's not an excuse. We all have to be mature about the roles we've been asked to play here.\"\n\nGallant's farewell address struck a different tone from his speech at the closure of the throne speech debate. (James West/The Canadian Press)\n\nNot having explained his own role in becoming jaded, Gallant committed himself to being a more collaborative leader of the Official Opposition while the Liberals seek a new leader.\n\nHe said he would speak around the province about official bilingualism, a subject he admitted he didn't address enough as language issues grew in importance and toxicity over his four years in power.\n\n\"We can strengthen our social fabric and be more united than ever if we talk about this issue in a fact-based and respectful way,\" he said.\n\nA bit of advice for Higgs\n\nOn Ottawa's plan to impose a carbon tax on New Brunswick \u2014 because his own plan failed to comply with the national standard \u2014 Gallant offered Higgs what felt like sincere advice.\n\nDon't fight it in court, he said: the Liberal government's own legal advice had concluded it was a losing battle. Instead, negotiate with Ottawa to develop a regime that works here while complying with federal requirements.\n\nHe even tossed out Prince Edward Island's model as one Higgs might like.\n\nAfter his government was defeated in the legislature, Gallant shook hands with Progressive Conservative Leader Blaine Higgs, who is now premier. (James West/Canadian Press)\n\nBut on other issues Gallant was decidedly, well, adversarial. He said Higgs \u2014 with 32 per cent of the popular vote in September's election \u2014 has \"no mandate\" to undo a Liberal moratorium on shale gas fracking.\n\nAnd he said he hopes the PCs won't \"sell their souls\" by letting the three-member People's Alliance caucus dictate government policy.\n\nAnd what about in the legislature \u2014 the place Gallant's \"new approach\" went to die?\n\n\"The caucus is completely resolved to do what we can to be more collaborative,\" Gallant said.\n\nBut that question period strategy from his first day 2013, when Gallant and his MLAs offered to help the PC government \u2014 only to be spurned? Will he try it again?\n\nThe new spirit of collaboration doesn't extend to showing your hand.\n\n\"I won't say anything now,\" Gallant said. \"It might be a good strategy and I don't want them to be ready for it.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Inmate confesses to 90 killings; investigators corroborate 30", "description": "A man convicted of three California murders and long suspected in numerous other deaths now claims he was involved in about 90 killings nationwide spanning nearly four decades.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/samuel-little-90-deaths-1.4907743", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4907825.1542318743!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/serial-strangling.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:02:10Z", "content": "A man convicted of three California murders and long suspected in numerous other deaths now claims he was involved in about 90 killings nationwide spanning nearly four decades, and investigators already have corroborated about a third of those, a Texas prosec\u2026 [+3513 chars]", "fulltext": "A man convicted of three California murders and long suspected in numerous other deaths now claims he was involved in about 90 killings nationwide spanning nearly four decades, and investigators already have corroborated about a third of those, a Texas prosecutor said Thursday.\n\nEctor County District Attorney Bobby Bland said 78-year-old Samuel Little was booked into jail this week following his indictment in the 1994 death of a Texas woman. Investigations are ongoing, but Little has provided details in more than 90 deaths dating to about 1970, Bland said.\n\nLittle was brought to Texas in September, and investigators with law enforcement agencies in several states travelled to speak with him about unsolved homicides.\n\n\"They're able to match up over 30 cases so far,\" Bland said. \"So far, we don't have any false information coming from him.\"\n\n8 other states\n\nIf the number of killings Little claims to have committed proves true, it would make him one of the most prolific killers in U.S. history. Ted Bundy confessed to 30 homicides from about 1974 to 1978. John Wayne Gacy killed at least 33 boys and young men in the 1970s.\n\nArguably one of the deadliest globally was an English general practitioner named Harold Shipman, who an investigative panel determined was responsible for the deaths of 250 people. He was convicted in 2000 in the deaths of 15.\n\nA more recent photo of Little provided by the Ector County Texas Sheriff's Office. (Ector County Texas Sheriff's Office via AP)\n\nDuring his 2014 trial in Los Angeles, prosecutors said Little was likely responsible for at least 40 killings since 1980. Authorities at the time were looking for possible links to deaths in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Texas.\n\nBland said Little recently provided details to Texas Ranger James Holland that showed Little was in Odessa, Texas, when Denise Christie Brothers was last seen in 1994. Her body was found about a month later in a vacant lot. Holland eventually elicited a confession from Little and admissions to dozens of other killings from about 1970 to 2005, Bland said.\n\nThe rangers are an elite team of investigators within the Texas Department of Public Safety. DPS did not respond to requests Thursday to speak with Holland.\n\nArrested at 16\n\nLittle was being held without bond Thursday in the Ector County jail on a murder charge relating to Brothers' death. Jail records don't indicate whether he has an attorney. He has a court appearance scheduled for Nov. 26.\n\nLittle was brought to Texas for questioning in the case from California, where he was convicted in 2014 in the deaths years earlier of the three women in Los Angeles County. DNA evidence collected from old crime scenes was used to match samples of his stored in a criminal database.\n\nLos Angeles cold-case detectives at the time suspected Little was a serial killer, a transient and former boxer who travelled the country preying on drug addicts, troubled women and others.\n\nThose detectives determined that Little often delivered a knockout punch to women and then proceeded to strangle them while masturbating, dumping the bodies and soon after leaving town.\n\nLittle, who often went by the name Samuel McDowell, grew up with his grandmother in Lorain, Ohio. His criminal history includes offences committed in 24 states spread over 56 years \u2014 mostly assault, burglary, armed robbery, shoplifting and drug violations. His first arrest came at age 16 on burglary charges.\n\nFor years he had denied to investigators in different states that he was responsible for any killings. Bland speculates that he finally confessed after the appeals to his life sentence in California were ultimately rejected and he no longer had any reason to hide his role.\n\n\"People for years have been trying to get a confession out of him, and James Holland is the one who finally got him to give that information,\" Bland said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Ian Bickis", "title": "Dividing lines between credit unions, banks blurring but key differences remain", "description": "Credit unions that are expanding their services nationally, such as Surrey-based Coast Capital Savings, are creating new competition in the financial services sector.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/dividing-lines-between-credit-unions-banks-blurring-but-key-differences-remain-1.4906844", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4109108.1542301666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/coast-capital-credit-union-head-office.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:00:00Z", "content": "Distinctions between credit unions and private banks are fading as online banking, changing regulations, and competition have changed the retail banking landscape, but a few fundamental differences remain for those undecided between the two.

However, both sides have recently pushed deeper into the other's turf, said Tom Drake, founder of financial advice website MapleMoney.\n\n'Lines are getting blurred'\n\n\"I think the lines are getting blurred quite a bit now. It used to be that credit unions were sort of the one place to get what you can count on being a good deal, but with offers like Tangerine and Simplii Financial and even EQ Bank, it's getting a little harder to see that difference.\"\n\nWhile Scotiabank's Tangerine and CIBC's Simplii now offer pared down no-fee chequing and savings accounts pioneered by credit unions, financial co-operatives have countered by expanding their collective no-fee ATM network in 2015 to become the second largest in Canada.\n\nCredit unions are also in the early days of eroding one of the remaining differentiators \u2014 that they're provincially-based.\n\nSurrey, B.C.-based Coast Capital Savings, which boasts of being Canada's largest credit union by membership (outside of the Desjardins network of Caisse de depots in Quebec), recently announced it had secured approval to become a national credit union under legislation passed in 2012.\n\nThe credit union, the second in the country to get approval to go national after New Brunswick-based UNI credit union, has not announced details of its expansion but says it presents a new front of competition in the financial services space.\n\n\"It's never been an option at the national level,\" said Dave Cunningham, head of public affairs for the credit union.\n\n\"Right now, because we're confined to our own province, like every other provincial credit union, if our members move to another province, they have to leave us.\"\n\nWe are excited that Coast Capital Savings has received approval from the federal government to become a federal credit union, as of November 1, 2018.

Credit unions maintain that because they're owned by their customers, they're motivated to offer better service and more community investments.\n\n\"The whole objective is different. They serve their members,\" said Martha Durdin, CEO of the Canadian Credit Union Association\n\nCredit unions have won the Ipsos overall customer service award 13 years in a row, Durdin points out. They also give away a much bigger share of earnings, though it amounts to less because banks are just so much bigger.\n\n\"Banks give what, one per cent of pre-tax profits? Credit unions give five per cent on average. That's a huge difference,\" said Durdin.\n\nCanadian Credit Union Association CEO Martha Durdin says credit unions give back a larger percentage of their profits to members than banks do. (Canadian Credit Union Association)\n\nThe generosity is possible because credit unions aren't solely focused on profit, she said.\n\n\"Profit is good in the sense you want enough profit to be stable, and to be able to have enough capital so you can lend to your members, but it's not an endless drive for increased profits.\"\n\nMaking financial decisions based on values can make sense, but Drake warns not to get too far away from the bottom line.\n\n\"If it's important to someone, then sure, a credit union's a better choice. I wouldn't necessarily make a big financial decision on it. If the mortgage rate's a per cent higher, then you should probably be looking somewhere else.\"\n\nBig banks have big tech advantage\n\nAnd while credit unions have been tech pioneers in areas such as mobile cheque deposits, banks have more resources to invest in innovation.\n\nTechnology is a big advantage offered by banks, including investments in artificial intelligence and secure online services, said Marina Mandal, vice president of banking transformation and strategy at the Canadian Bankers Association.\n\n\"There's a lot of effort by the banks to be ahead of the curve in how they use technology to provide a seamless and integrated experience.\"\n\nDrake said that overall credit unions seem generally caught up, but banks still lead on new automated offerings like robo-advisors.\n\n\"Banks like BMO and RBC have launched them recently too. It could be an example of where they're behind again. But in general, I feel like they're caught up.\"\n\nDrake, who has accounts with Tangerine, Simplii as well as a more conventional accounts with major banks, says the free offerings have made it hard to bother switching, even though credit unions are probably more on your side.\n\n\"It's hard to quantify for sure, but just the idea that there's things like profit share and you are an owner, and they're not really looking to make a profit, it gives you probably a better chance that they're in your corner.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "CBC Nova Scotia News November 15, 2018", "description": "The only daily TV news package to focus on Nova Scotians and their stories", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cbc-nova-scotia-news-november-15-2018-1.4908022", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4908022.1542351607!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/image.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:00:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nCBC Nova Scotia News November 15, 2018\n\nThe only daily TV news package to focus on Nova Scotians and their stories"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "B.C. moves to close polluting Tulsequah Chief mine site", "description": "The mine, about 80 kilometres south of Atlin, B.C., has been inactive and leaking acid runoff for years.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/tulsequah-chief-mine-closure-bc-1.4907645", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4051099.1491013672!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tulsequah-chief-mine.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:58:46Z", "content": "A notorious mine site in northern B.C. that's been leaking acid runoff for years may finally be cleaned up.

But since 2011, Green Standards said its efforts have diverted 46,000 tons of what would otherwise have been waste, and redistributed them to community agencies in need \u2014 for no added cost to the companies with stuff they want to get rid of.\n\n\"Throwing out your furniture in the landfill is not free or cheap,\" Langdon said. \"You have to pay for movers and trucks and then tipping fees,\" he notes, which is why his sales pitch most often focuses on how their services can save money \u2014 if not the planet.\n\n\"For a very similar cost [to throw it out] we are able to manage it for them, save them time and money and achieve a result much more in line with what they are trying to do,\" he said\n\nHe cites the example of Adobe Inc., the California-based technology company that was renovating its headquarters in 2012. Green Standards worked with the company to find new homes for several floors worth of office furniture that would have otherwise been bound for the landfill.\n\nFor less than what it would have cost to throw out, Adobe ended up donating the equivalent of $444,678 US to local community groups. \"It's a great way to walk the talk when it comes to sustainability,\" Langdon said.\n\nBack in Ikea's showroom, consumers who spoke to CBC News could also see the upside.\n\nWhile perusing a sampling of gently used furniture at a Toronto-area store, shopper Alex Ketchum said he would consider it. \"If it's in good condition, yeah why not,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's pretty genius,\" he said. \"It's kind of like recycling.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jonathon Gatehouse", "title": "Brexit omnishambles throws British government into chaos", "description": "A closer look at the day's most notable stories with The National's Jonathon Gatehouse: Britain's future is far from clear as Brexit draft deal draws intense criticism; small northern Ontario mining town of Cobalt may soon become extremely important to the in\u2026", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/national-today-newsletter-brexit-nationalism-cobalt-1.4902716", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4906925.1542300043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/afp-1av1we.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:11:57Z", "content": "Welcome to The National Today newsletter, which takes a closer look at what's happening around some of the day's most notable stories.

Watch it here.\n\nBrexit breakdown\n\nOnce upon a time, it seemed like a smart political move.\n\nAt the beginning of 2013, then-Prime Minister David Cameron promised a simple \"in/out vote\" on Britain's membership in the European Union, if only to quiet the Brussels-haters on his own backbench.\n\nThe pledge helped unite his party while blunting a right-wing challenge from the U.K. Independence Party. And two years later, the Conservatives coasted to victory in the general election, transforming their minority government into a majority.\n\nThe Brexit referendum in June 2016 was supposed to solidify the status quo. But the \"Remain\" campaign was lacklustre, and the opinion polls that predicted a pro-EU win proved to be wrong. The \"Leave\" forces carried the day with a narrow 51.9 per cent to 48.1 per cent victory. And 10 hours later, Cameron quit his job.\n\nThe task of extracting Britain from its 45-year relationship with Europe while trying to hold a fractured Tory party together was always going to be a thankless one. And when none of the Brexit agitators could build sufficient support, it ultimately fell to someone who had campaigned for the Remain side, Theresa May.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street in London to give a statement on the draft Brexit deal in the House of Commons on Thursday. (Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBut now as the clock ticks down to next year's March 29 divorce date, an already chaotic process has become what the Brits call an \"omnishambles.\"\n\nYesterday, May finally unveiled her draft exit deal with the EU after 17 months of fraught negotiations with Brussels. A special meeting to sell her cabinet colleagues on the agreement dragged on for five hours, and when the prime minister finally emerged from 10 Downing Street to address reporters, she stood by herself in the darkness.\n\nBy this morning, all pretence of party unity was gone. So far, four of her ministers have quit in protest of the compromise deal, including Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, citing \"fatal flaws.\"\n\nA screen shows the drop in the value of the British pound following the resignation of Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, Dominic Raab, on Thursday. The pound dived as a string of British government resignations appeared to put a draft Brexit deal in serious jeopardy, dealers said. (Ben Fathers/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn the House of Commons, May's vow that the draft treaty will lead to a \"smooth and orderly\" exit from the EU was met with derisive laughter from both her own and opposition benches.\n\nAnd shortly afterwards, on the lawn outside Westminster, one of her hardline Brexit MPs, Jacob Rees-Mogg, launched the campaign for a vote of non-confidence in his boss, struggling to make himself heard over the amplified shouts of a protestor wearing a Stop-Brexit top hat and a Union Jack cape.\n\nEarly indications are that there isn't much public support for May's deal, which will avoid a hard border in Ireland, but keep the U.K. at least tenuously tied to Europe and still subject to many EU regulations.\n\nAn overnight YouGov poll found 75 per cent of respondents saying that May has failed to achieve what she promised in the negotiations, and 85 per cent saying the process is a \"mess.\" The survey placed support for leaving the EU at 46 per cent, versus 54 per cent for remaining. And calls for a redo referendum are growing.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> has collided with reality and now the cowardly bastards who plotted its course scramble for the lifeboats squealing \u2018it\u2019s all her fault!

So it's a perfect time to sit back and think about some of these bigger ideas.\n\nIt's what Andrew Coyne did very eloquently in his column this week, making the case for the good kind of nationalism. \"Difficult as it may be to believe amid the narrowness and nastiness of so much of today's nationalism, there is a another kind of nationalism, one that is about inclusiveness, rather than exclusion; co-operation with other nations, rather than conflict.\"\n\nWe'll try to unpack some of that, lay out what the risks are to countries and to people \u2014 and whether any of it is just \"elitism\" as Harper seems to think.\n\nAndrew, Chantal H\u00e9bert and Andray Domise join us tonight on At Issue.\n\nSee you later!\n\n- Rosemary Barton\n\nWATCH: At Issue tonight on The National on CBC Television and streamed online\n\nLike this newsletter?

But for all the minutes and hours a day you spend staring at that bright-lit screen, how much time have you spent thinking about the batteries that power your phone? The likely answer is not much, unless you happen to be running low on juice.\n\nBut it's a timely question, because battery makers are bracing for a global shortage of cobalt.\n\nThe metallic element is a key component of batteries. Grams of cobalt go into a phone battery, but pounds of the stuff go into a car battery. And as electric car sales increase, there's growing concern about sourcing enough cobalt to meet demand.\n\nPlus, most of the world's cobalt supply comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The industry in that country is rife with human rights abuses, child labour and environmental concerns.\n\nSo prospectors have turned to an old mining town in northern Ontario that, as fate would have it, happens to be called \u2026 Cobalt.\n\nA crew from First Cobalt drills in the hills outside the town of Cobalt, Ont., searching for the metal that's needed for batteries to power things like phones and electric cars. (Carly Thomas/CBC)\n\nCobalt, the town, was built on silver mines in the early 1900s. Cobalt, the metal, wasn't worth anything back then. It was just an indicator, a sign that something of actual value was nearby.\n\nRetired miners tell stories about the good old days decades ago when the mines produced silver \u2014 there was an opera here, a professional hockey team and a streetcar. When the mines closed down the community fell on hard times, and now it feels like a ghost town.\n\nBut while the silver mines have been picked clean, a ghostly pink hue runs through the rock in many of the old, abandoned shafts. All that pink is cobalt.\n\nCobalt is one of the best-performing commodities of the past few years. The price per pound fluctuated around $12 US for several years, but started to climb in 2017. It spiked to more than $40 earlier this year, and currently sits around $20 per pound.\n\nSo, prospectors have begun digging and drilling in Cobalt, Ont., hoping to prove the silver mines have enough cobalt left behind to warrant a new mining operation.\n\nWe met Frank Basa, CEO of Canada Cobalt Works, at the bottom of the old Castle Mine where water now runs knee-deep in parts. Basa's a story-teller, a natural promoter who shines a flashlight on thick pink veins of cobalt running along the mineshaft.\n\nFrank Basa, CEO of Canada Cobalt Works, outside the 100-year-old Castle Mine.

Peters said she feels Kirkness's story is important for Canadians to know.\n\nVerna Kirkness has dedicated her life to improving education for Indigenous students. Listen to her story told by her nephew, Doug Beyer. 6:49\n\nKirkness was born and raised in Fisher River Cree Nation, Man., about 200 km north of Winnipeg. When she was four, she would go knock on the school's door to try and get in.\n\n\"I wanted to be a teacher but I never really expressed that because I never had a Native teacher,\" said Kirkness.\n\n\"I didn't know that our people could be teachers.\"\n\nAfter Grade 8, she was separated from her peers because she was a non-status Indian. While her all her friends were sent to residential school, Kirkness went to high school with non-Indigenous students in Teulon, Man.\n\n\"It was the first time I was among non-Indigenous people,\" said Kirkness.\n\nIn the 1950s she earned a teaching diploma and went back home to teach in Fisher River. In 1959, she wanted a first-hand experience of being at a residential school. She went to work at Birtle Indian Residential School, and was saddened by what she saw.\n\n\"They didn't want the children to get to be with me,\" said Kirkness.\n\nKirkness said the administration at the school didn't want her to return after her first year, but she went back for a second to show them that she wouldn't back down.\n\nQ. What is your favourite accomplishment as an educator?\n\nVK: Being a part of the policy [paper] of \"Indian Control of Indian Education\" back in 1972. It's still a landmark policy and document that all of the progress since then has been based on for First Nations people. Before that, our people had no say at all in their children's education.\n\nKirkness with former student Harold Cochrane. (As It Happened Productions)\n\nOnce that policy came out, things changed, even though it's been a constant struggle to have it our way. When we first thought about it, we certainly had our thoughts on bringing in indigenous curriculum, history, languages and everything. Since then, a lot has happened, but more could have happened if we had the co-operation of the government when we were moving forward. However, I still think it is a landmark document and policy that set us on track for where we are today.\n\nQ: What are you up to these days?\n\nVK: I'm helping with the Kirkness Science and Engineering program. This is the 10th year of the program. We started small in Winnipeg. Now we have nine centres across the country. In a nutshell, we bring in and try to encourage more Indigenous students to go into the science and engineering fields, because we don't have too many that enter that field.\n\nAt the University of Manitoba I'm the one that started the program to get more Indigenous PhDs at the school. At least a dozen have graduated with their PhDs since the program started.\n\nQ. What message would you have for young Indigenous students?\n\nVK: I just love to see them believe in themselves and look to the future and follow their dreams. I was so excited this last June when I was invited to my reserve. I saw 22 graduates, almost an even split between males and females. We tend to see more of our females going through than males, so this was nice to see. I noticed that they were all 18 and 19 years old, and right on age/grade par.\n\nFisher River Cree Nation is about 200 km north of Winnipeg. (As It Happened Productions)\n\nMost importantly, they all had their plans for September for what they we're going to do in post-secondary. That's the kind of thing that I like to see. That really touched my heart to see how far we've come in my own reserve.\n\nOne thing I've noticed over the years, as soon as we could get more Indigenous studies into these post-secondary institutions, our students when they graduate, they really want to get out there and help to advance our Indigenous Peoples' lives, whether it's in health or in business or education, whatever.\n\nWhen I started teaching, I think there were 20 of us Indigenous teachers across Canada. And now we've got thousands just in the field of education. Now there is much more influence toward making lives better for our people, our students, our children.\n\nQ. What message would you have for Indigenous educators getting into the field?\n\nVK: I feel that most of them, they know what works. I remember when we first started talking about changing the curriculum and including Indian culture, they thought all we were going to do was beadwork. It's a far cry from what we had in mind. We need a true history out there.\n\nI've talked to a lot of young educators. They are already inspired to go out there and do a good job. Our universities now, thankfully, have a number of Indigenous people also that are professors that are teaching them. That's where all of the difference begins to happen."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jesse Campigotto", "title": "Quarterbacks got (a bit) safer today", "description": "The Buzzer is CBC Sports' daily newsletter.

Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox every weekday.\n\nHere's what you need to know right now from the world of sports:\n\nIt just got (a little) safer to be a CFL quarterback\n\nThe league made a pretty big on-the-fly move today, adding an extra official whose only job is to watch for hits to the head and neck of QBs. They'll start right away. There will be one on the field for both of this Sunday's playoff games, which will decide who plays in the Grey Cup. The hope is that the extra ref acts as a deterrent to dangerous hits, since those hits are now more likely to be penalized.\n\nThis is partly a response to a controversial hit late in last week's playoff game between Saskatchewan and Winnipeg. Roughriders QB Brandon Bridge was knocked out of the game by a vicious high hit that went unflagged (Jackson Jeffcoat, who delivered the blow, later received the max fine from the league). A replay showed the referee in position to make the call had his view blocked by a player. The Riders weren't happy, and you can't blame them. Bridge, the backup, was only playing because No. 1 QB Zach Collaros was laid low by another high hit in their regular-season finale. No flag was thrown on that one either.\n\nHead injuries to quarterbacks have been a problem for the CFL this year. There's a concussion spotter at every game, but they're missing things. Commissioner Randy Ambrosie admitted that Collaros shouldn't have been allowed to keep playing after his hit, and Montreal's Johnny Manziel stayed in a game after getting crushed at the goal-line (he later went into the league's concussion protocol and sat out a few games).\n\nSince taking over as CFL commissioner in 2017, Ambrosie has tried to improve safety. The former player banned full-contact practices and added an extra bye week for every team. He says he's \"committed to removing reckless and dangerous play from our game\" and his actions mostly back that up. But Ambrosie, like his predecessors, still hasn't admitted a link between football-related concussions and degenerative brain disease \u2014 even though studies have suggested one exists.\n\nIn pro football, quarterbacks are the most protected players on the field. For good reason: it's hard to protect your body from an onrushing 300-pounder when you're trying to chuck a ball 40 yards downfield. And great QBs make the game go 'round. It's important to keep them healthy. That's why both the CFL and NFL have altered their rules in recent years to make it harder to hit them. It's paid off in the NFL, where scoring is up this year and fans are embracing the flashier product.\n\nUsain Bolt might be done with soccer already\n\nThe greatest sprinter of all time spent two months trying to win a spot on a team in Australia's top league. That ended when he rejected a contract offer a couple of weeks ago. The team reportedly offered Bolt about $150,000 US, but he wanted more. Both sides tried to find a sponsor to fatten the deal, but it didn't work out.\n\nNow Bolt says he'll decide by the end of the month whether he'll keep pursuing a soccer career. He scored two goals in a friendly but was generally considered not good enough for the Australian league, which is far from elite.\n\nCould Bolt make a track comeback? He'd be the story of the 2020 Olympics if he decided to go for his fourth (!) consecutive titles in the 100, 200 and 4x100, or any combination of those. It's not out of the question. Bolt will still be only 33 for the Tokyo Games. The runner-up to him in 2016, Justin Gatlin, was 34.\n\nSure, this was fun. But it would be nice to see him back on the track. (Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nQuickly\u2026\n\nDwane Casey got his revenge. The former Raptors coach, who was fired last spring after leading the team to its best-ever regular season, returned to Toronto last night as coach of the Pistons. His new guys came through for him as Blake Griffin dropped 30 points and Reggie Bullock hit a buzzer beater for a 106-104 win. It was Toronto's second straight loss at home after starting 7-0. \"I'm not happy for him,\" Raps guard Kyle Lowry said with his typical grace. \"We should have won the game.\"\n\nLeBron James is coming for Michael Jordan. The Lakers star (still feels weird to say that) scored 44 points last night to pass Wilt Chamberlain for fifth place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. Next up is Jordan. LeBron should pass him sometime early in the new year if he maintains his career scoring average of about 27 points per game and doesn't get hurt (he's pretty much indestructible, so count on that). When that happens, get ready for another round of \"Who's the greatest ever?\" takes... OK, you twisted my arm. For me it's still MJ. For now. LeBron is only 33, so by the time he's done there's a good chance he'll be the No. 1 all-time scorer. And he could even win three more rings to match Jordan's six. Then you'd have to go LeBron.\n\nThis year's NL Cy Young winner is another example of how baseball thinking has changed. Back in the Stone Age (before Moneyball) a pitcher needed a lot of wins to be named the best in his league. Now nobody cares about that. It's a deeply flawed stat \u2014 it's possible to give up, say, 20 runs and still get a win. Jacob deGrom won the National League Cy Young yesterday with only 10 wins \u2014 lowering the bar from the previous low of 13. Voters see more nuance these days, and they took into account the poor run support deGrom got from his Mets teammates, as well as his high strikeout total and low earned-run average. In another sign of the times, Tampa Bay's Blake Snell won the AL Cy Young with just 180 innings pitched, the fewest ever for a starter winning the award. Starters aren't expected to work as long anymore in the modern game.\n\nChild kickboxing in Thailand is under the microscope after a 13-year-old boy died following a fight. Anucha Tasako was knocked out during a Muay Thai bout in a Bangkok suburb and reportedly suffered a brain hemorrhage. Muay Thai is a form of boxing that allows punching, kicking, elbow and knee strikes and standup grappling. It's fairly common for children in Thailand to fight for money, especially in rural areas, and proponents say it's a way for them to help support their families and rise out of poverty. Thai lawmakers are considering legislation banning anyone under 12 from fighting competitively. But Muay Thai supporters say that could kill the sport because it's essential to start young in order to master it.\n\nYou're up to speed.

(Submitted by Yana Eglit)\n\nThe hemimastigotes analyzed by the Dalhousie team were found by Eglit during a spring hike with some other students along the Bluff Wilderness Trail outside Halifax a couple of years ago. She often has empty sample vials in her pockets or bags, and scooped a few tablespoons of dirt into one of them from the side of the trail.\n\nBack at the lab, she soaked the soil in water, which often revives microbes that have gone dormant, waiting for the next big rainstorm. Over the next few weeks, she checked on the dish through a microscope to see what might be swimming around.\n\nStrange movements\n\nThen, one day, about three weeks later, she saw something that caught her eye \u2014 something shaped like the partially opened shell of a pistachio. It had lots of hairs, called flagella, sticking out. Most known microbes with lots of flagella move them in co-ordinated waves, but not this one, which waved them in a more random fashion.\n\n\"It's as if these cells never really learned that they have many flagella,\" Eglit said with a laugh. She had seen something with that strange motion once before, a few years ago, and recognized it as a rare hemimastigote.\n\nHemimastigotes were first seen and described in the 19th century. But at that time, no one could figure out how they fit into the evolutionary tree of life. Consequently, they've been \"a tantalizing mystery\" to microbiologists for quite a long time, Eglit said.\n\nLight microscopes show the two hemimastigotes, Spironema, left, and Hemimastix kukwesjijk, found in the same dish. (Yana Eglit/Nature)\n\nLike animals, plants, fungi and ameobas \u2014 but unlike bacteria \u2014 hemimastigotes have complex cells that have mini-organs called organelles including a nucleus that holds chromosomes of DNA, making them part of the \"domain\" of organisms called eukaryotes rather than bacteria or archaea.\n\nAbout 10 species of hemimastigotes have been described over more than 100 years. But up until now, no one had been able to do a genetic analysis to see how they were related to other living things.\n\nRealizing that she had something very rare and special, Eglit flagged another graduate student Gordon Lax, who specializes in genetic analyses of individual microbes \u2014 a new and tricky technique \u2014 to see where they fit in the evolutionary tree. The pair dropped everything to analyze the new microbe.\n\nThe co-authors of the new study include, left to right, Dalhousie University postdoctoral researcher Laura Eme, Eglit and fellow graduate student Gordon Lax. (Michelle L\u00e9ger)\n\nNew species\n\nEglit wanted to see if she could find more of the creatures in the dish, and, as she was looking, she spotted another kind of hemimastigote.\n\n\"To our tremendous surprise, two of these extremely rarely seen organisms ended up in one dish.\"\n\nThere were more of the second kind, which turned out to be a new species.\n\nThe researchers named itHemimastix kukwesjijk after Kukwes, a greedy, hairy ogre from the mythology of the local Mi'kmaq people. (The suffix \"jijk\" means \"little.\")\n\nEglit watched carefully as it hunted. Hemimastix shoots little harpoons called extrusomes to attack prey such as Spumella, a relative of aquatic microbes called diatoms. It grasps its prey by curling its flagella around it, bringing it to a \"mouth\" on one end of the cell called a capitulum \"as it presumably sucks its cytoplasm out,\" Eglit said.\n\nHemimastix kukwesjijk feeds on its prey in this microscope image. It attacks the prey with harpoon-like organs, then uses its flagella to bring the prey to its mouth, called a capitulum, and sucks out the juices or cytoplasm. (Yana Eglit/Nature)\n\nOnce she knew what it ate, she reared its prey in captivity so she could also feed and breed captive Hemimastix: \"We were able to domesticate it, in a way.\"\n\nThat means scientists can now give captive specimens to other scientists to study, and their rarity is not the issue it was before.\n\nBased on the genetic analysis they've done so far, the Dalhousie team has determined that hemimastigotes are unique and different enough from other organisms to form their own \"supra-kingdom\" \u2014 a grouping so big that animals and fungi, which have their own kingdoms, are considered similar enough to be part of the same supra-kingdom.\n\nThey are now doing a more complete genetic analysis of Hemimastix.

(Terry Roberts/CBC)\n\nAccording to this report, Nalcor told the PUB it did not include a strategic reserve because of savings associated with the federal loan guarantee, and the use of conventional technology for the Labrador-Island transmission link.\n\n\"This document was disclosed and available to anyone in government,\" Simmons said.\n\nThompson acknowledged that, but added, \"We would have expected as well from Nalcor in the course of meetings \u2026 that if this is a key decision variable that needed the attention of the shareholder, that it would have been brought up.\"\n\nWe would have expected as well from Nalcor in the course of meetings ... that if this is a key decision variable that needed the attention of the shareholder, that it would have been brought up. - Robert Thompson\n\nFormer Nalcor CEO Ed Martin routinely briefed government on issues related to risk, Thompson explained, but he could not recall any briefings related to tactical or strategic risk, or any reference to the allowance.\n\n\"My only surprise would have been that as a key decision variable, we hadn't talked about it and been briefed about it in these terms. So when I read this it seemed like new information to me,\" Thompson said.\n\nMeanwhile, Martin and other key figures in the planning and execution of Muskrat will provide testimony on this and a multitude of other critical issues when they appear before the inquiry.\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Laurie Fagan", "title": "Prosecutors reject son's plea in double-murder trial", "description": "Crown prosecutors have rejected a plea of manslaughter by an Ottawa man on trial for two counts of first-degree murder in the violent deaths of his parents.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/prosecutors-reject-plea-murder-trial-starts-1.4907345", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3874732.1480530727!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cameron-rogers.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:03:15Z", "content": "Crown prosecutors have rejected a plea of manslaughter by an Ottawa man on trial for two counts of first-degree murder in the violent deaths of his parents.

Quebec saw the same decline a day earlier. In New Brunswick, P.E.I. and Nova Scotia the drop was 3.2 cents, on average.\n\nOut West, the decline is even more pronounced in some places.\n\n\"Western Canada will see a two cent a litre decrease,\" said Dan McTeague, senior petroleum analyst for the price-comparing site. \"That's everything except for Vancouver and the Lower Mainland [because] in Vancouver they are waking up to a six cent a litre decrease.\"\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data, across the country, the average price for a litre of gasoline was 114.82 cents on Thursday. That's the lowest it's been since February.\n\nOther fuel blends are feeling the pinch even more than West Texas Intermediate. Much of the gasoline used in Eastern Canada is priced off of Brent crude, which has recently fallen to just over $65 US a barrel, its lowest level since April. But virtually all types of oil are seeing price declines, and none more so than the type that comes from Western Canada.\n\nThe heavier blend of oil extracted from Alberta's oilsands is known as Western Canada Select (WCS), and a barrel of that was going for near its lowest level on record Thursday \u2014 less than $14 US a barrel.\n\nThe reason is a lack of pipeline capacity \u2014 a problem the industry has complained about for years but is becoming more acute. Oil producers can't find ways of moving their product out of Alberta to refineries, which has created a glut that's led to record-low prices for WCS.\n\nThe Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says the price gap between U.S. and Canadian oil is so dramatic, it has cost the Canadian economy $13 billion so far this year \u2014 or roughly $50 million a day.\n\nThe CEO of oilsands producer Cenovus Energy said this week the situation is an \"emergency\" that warrants government intervention.\n\nOne of the ideas being floated would be for the government to implement OPEC-style production quotas, where individual companies are limited to only producing a certain amount of oil in an attempt to get prices up.\n\nIt's an idea that's drawing a lot of criticism, but it's not unprecedented. Peter Lougheed's Alberta government briefly attempted something similar in the 1980s.\n\n\"The government has tools to deal with this,\" Cenovus CEO Alex Pourbaix said. \"It's temporary but a very acute situation.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jamie-Lee McKenzie", "title": "1,000s of acres of potatoes still unharvested in farmers' frozen fields", "description": "There are 5,200 acres of potatoes in Manitoba farmers' fields that won't make it to people's tables.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/frozen-potatoes-crops-harvest-1.4906564", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4834831.1537639326!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/potatoes-hay-river.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:28:47Z", "content": "There are 5,200 acres of potatoes in Manitoba farmers' fields that won't make it to people's tables.

Yet a new survey reveals many are struggling, often in isolation, trying to fulfil a critical role with not enough support from the health-care system.\n\nResults of the Ontario-based survey of 800 caregivers aged 16 and older, released Thursday by the Change Foundation, paints a picture of people often thrown unexpectedly into a role for which they typically aren't trained and one that has major effects on their physical and mental health, relationships and career paths.\n\n\"Family caregivers provide the vast majority of care that happens in between appointments with physicians or in between hospital stays or different interactions with the health-care system,\" said Christa Haanstra of the Change Foundation, an independent health policy think-tank dedicated to enhancing patient and caregiver experiences.\n\n\"There's a lot more health care happening in the home, provided in large part by family caregivers,\" said Haanstra, noting that caregivers are often invisible in the health-care system, with their contributions going unrecognized as well as unrewarded.\n\n\"We really think about them as the glue that keeps the health-care system together.\"\n\nFinancial and emotional toll\n\nThe online survey, conducted in May by the polling firm Pollara Strategic Insights, found that caregivers overall appreciated the time spent with their loved ones and believed they were improving their lives.\n\nBut 61 per cent admitted they took on the role because they believed they had no choice, with many at times feeling trapped, helpless, frustrated and overwhelmed.\n\nThe survey found 36 per cent of caregivers felt depressed and 33 per cent were resentful of their role, with almost half overall saying caregiving had negatively affected their ability to have personal time, engage in travel or enjoy a social life.\n\nOne-third said they had experienced financial costs due to caregiving, including out-of-pocket expenses, time off work and turning down career opportunities. Eight per cent lost their jobs due to caregiving responsibilities.\n\n\"Family caregivers are providing care to almost everyone \u2014 siblings, parents, children \u2014 and they cover diseases across the spectrum,\" said Haanstra, who has a young child and also helps care for both her aging parents and a relative with a chronic illness.\n\n\"Obviously, the largest group is caring for people with health-care issues related to aging, Alzheimer's being one of them, frailty being another.\n\n\"But we are also talking about providing care to people with cancer, with disabilities, mental illness, chronic diseases of many varieties and acute illness, post-injury or accident,\" she said, noting that an estimated 28 per cent of Canadians over 15 have taken on a family caregiver role.\n\n'Completely dependent'\n\nOne of those people is 25-year-old Stephane Alexis of Ottawa, Ont., who helps his parents care for his younger brother Torence, who has cerebral palsy and is non-verbal.\n\n\"He's completely dependent, he needs help with feeding, changing, even turning in bed,\" Alexis said of Torence, 22. \"He's a pretty heavy dude, so there's a good amount of lifting involved.\"\n\nAlexis, who attends a private photographic arts college, helps out after school and on weekends attending to his brother's needs, but their relationship goes far beyond that.\n\n\"He's completely dependent, he needs help with feeding, changing, even turning in bed,\" Alexis said of Torence, 22. \"He's a pretty heavy dude, so there's a good amount of lifting involved.\" (Justin Tang/Canadian Press)\n\n\"I love my brother a lot. I love spending time with him. He's funny, he makes me laugh.\"\n\nBut Alexis admitted that even being a part-time caregiver comes at a cost. He's often exhausted, has little time to socialize with friends, and has had to put some life goals on hold.\n\n\"I was planning on moving out [of the family home] relatively soon, but I feel like I can't do that. I can't leave and just let my parents fend for themselves.\"\n\nHe's frustrated there's so little support from the health-care system: the family receives only 15 hours a week of help from two social services agencies.\n\n\"It doesn't seem like there's really any funding for home care. They kind of just leave you out there,\" said Alexis, who believes his brother's quality of life is \"better at home\" than it would be in a publicly funded residence for people with special needs.\n\n\"Why not use some of that money that you would be investing in a residence and use some of that money for home care?\"\n\n'I was worn to a frazzle'\n\nFor Don Mahood, frustration with the health-care system began when he was trying to get a diagnosis for his wife Mary Charlotte, who had been experiencing worsening memory problems for some years, forcing the registered nurse to give up her job.\n\n\"I tried to get her diagnosed with the doctor with difficulty,\" Mahood, 76, said from London, Ont.\n\n\"You'd get to the doctor and say my wife has some dementia. He would give her a test and talk to her for maybe 10 or 15 minutes and tell me she's perfectly fine. Anyone with Alzheimer's, especially in the early stages, can really mask it.\"\n\nMahood finally got a referral \u2014 a year later \u2014 to the Aging Memory Clinic in London, where doctors in 2012 confirmed his wife had Alzheimer's.\n\nFor the next six years, Mahood was Mary Charlotte's 24-7 caregiver, until his wife of more than 50 years was moved to a long-term care facility about a year ago.\n\n\"At the end, I had to dress her, bathe her. I had to do everything, she couldn't brush her teeth,\" he said. \"When I look back, I don't even know how I did it myself.\n\n\"I was worn to a frazzle.\"\n\nThough caring for his wife was a labour of love, the disease put an end to their plans to spend part of their retirement years in Florida. Mahood also had to give up activities such as playing hockey, and his social life faltered as long-time friends dropped by the wayside.\n\n\"So my friends became others that were going through it ... I would never have survived if I hadn't belonged to support groups. That really saved my life in a sense.\"\n\nHaanstra said such stories, along with the survey results, demonstrate that the health-care system must do more to support caregivers and make it easier for them to access existing services.\n\n\"They're willing to do it, but we can't just send them home with no support and no information and expect that they're going to succeed.\"\n\nMargin of error was not applicable to the survey findings because of its online methodology, the researchers said. But the margin of error on a representative sample of 800 people would be +/- 3.5%, 19 times out of 20."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Ryan Snoddon", "title": "Winter driving season begins Friday in the Maritimes", "description": "CBC meteorologist Ryan Snoddon says Friday will bring a wintery mix of snow, ice pellets and then rain to the Maritimes.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-weather-forecast-november-15-2018-1.4907023", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4907102.1542303676!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/snowy-friday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:59:40Z", "content": "It's the most wonderful time of year... winter driving season!

It's true that gasoline use is an important area to target to reduce carbon emissions, she said, but the province's new gasoline taxes will replace ones that already existed, meaning the price difference will be minimal.\n\n\"Under the federal plan that was allocated,\" Jones said of a gasoline tax, \"but the provincial government was able to reduce taxes on fuel that they had implemented during budget restraints, and as a result I guess it's kind of balancing out.\"\n\nJones estimated that fuel costs in Newfoundland and Labrador will go up by a cent or a cent and a half per litre in the new year, well below the increases expected for other provinces.\n\nAnnouncement next week\n\nThe carbon pricing won't have a significant financial cost for consumers in the short term, Jones said, but affected businesses will notice a change come Jan. 1.\n\nThe Iron Ore Company of Canada, said Jones as an example, is one of the highest carbon producers in the country, and they will have to pay a price on pollution.\n\nCommunities like Black Tickle are a great place for alternative energy projects, says Jones. (Submitted by Tara Keefe)\n\nAt the same time, she added, the IOC has begun to do things like install new technology and upgrade its systems to reduce its carbon impact, which will mitigate some of those costs.\n\n\"We are going to be there to work with companies like that under our clean energy programs and help them adapt to other modules and new innovative techniques that will allow them to reduce carbon,\" she said.\n\nThe government also wants to work with communities that want to cut their carbon footprint, she said. Incentive programs will be provided for communities working on projects like alternate energy sources, and the three Indigenous communities in Labrador are engaged in this work, she said.\n\nBlack Tickle, for example, is dealing with a reported diesel fuel shortage. It's a small, contained community with a low energy requirement, so in the future it may be possible for it or similar communities to switch to lower-carbon energy, Jones said.\n\n\"It is a perfect example of where we could be doing alternate energy projects.\"\n\nNext week, Jones will announce several programs led by Indigenous governments to support climate action in Labrador.\n\nWith files from Labrador Morning\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Officer breaks hand during struggle with car thief", "description": "A Winnipeg police officer suffered a broken hand while struggling to arrest an alleged car thief on Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/car-thief-officer-breaks-hand-winnipeg-1.4907134", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3949513.1485262773!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/police-car-in-winnipeg.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:49:47Z", "content": "A Winnipeg police officer suffered a broken hand while struggling to arrest an alleged car thief on Wednesday.

According to the government, a full-time minimum wage worker would pay no provincial income tax and save as much as $850 each year for a single person or $1,250 for households with two eligible workers. Approximately 1.1 million people will see the benefit, the government said. It is set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2019.\n\nExempting new rental units from rent control, which the government says will encourage developers to build more affordable housing.\n\nCutting the number of legislative officers from nine to six. CBC Toronto previously reported that would include the environmental commissioner, child and youth advocate and French language services commissioner positions.\n\nCancelling a planned surtax on some of the highest earning Ontarians proposed by the previous Liberal government in its last budget that would have generated $275 million in revenue.\n\nCancelling a proposed French-language university, on top of three other cancelled university satellite campuses in the Toronto area.\n\nSome critics of the PCs move to freeze minimum wage at $14 per hour have said low-income workers would benefit more financially from a wage boost than a tax cut. An independent financial analysis also came to a similar conclusion. Criticisms were amplified by the province's promise and subsequent effort to rollback a suite of labour reforms enacted by the previous regime.\n\nAs for the legislative watchdog positions to be cut, their mandates will now be folded into other departments. The attorney general's office and the Ontario ombudsman's office will be granted expanded mandates and more resources to carry them out.\n\nThe current environmental commissioner, Dianne Saxe, has been a vocal critic of the PCs actions on climate change, particularly their vow to fight a federal carbon tax, pulling out of more than 700 renewable energy contracts and moving to end the Ontario Green Energy Act.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli in the Legislature as Fedeli tabled the annual fall economic outlook for the province. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press)\n\nFurthermore, the current youth and child advocate, Irwin Elman, has published a number of landmark reports that have had considerable impact on child welfare policies in the province. Elman said in a statement issued Thursday afternoon that he only learned of the impending change through media reports.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the legislature, Official Opposition and NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said scrapping the oversight positions is a means of suppressing criticism of the government and premier.\n\n\"It seems to me that Mr. Ford doesn't want to be accountable to the environmental commissioner,\" she said, adding that Premier Doug Ford has been \"vindictive\" to critics and rivals in the past.\n\nGreen Party Leader and MPP Mike Schreiner echoed that sentiment, saying Ford is laying the groundwork for increasingly little oversight of his government.\n\n\"They are undermining the checks and balances in a democracy that hold a government accountable.\"\n\nOntario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Thursday that the PCs do not appreciate how much average families are already struggling to make ends meet. (Christopher Katsarov/Canadian Press)\n\nPopulist bent\n\nThe economic outlook also indicates that the PCs want to increase the threshold to maintain official party status in Ontario's legislature from eight to 12. In a similar vein, the province plans to end public subsidies for political parties by 2022 \u2014 a move that could have financial consequences for parties with only a small presence at Queen's Park.\n\nThe PC's economic outlook also included several signature populist commitments.\n\nThe government intends to extend hours of LCBO stores, allowing them to sell alcohol between 9 a.m. and 11 p.m. every day of the week. It also committed to developing a plan to bring beer and wine sales to convenience and big box stores.\n\nAccording to the PCs, Ontario currently faces a $14.5-billion deficit, a figure considerably larger than that reported by the previous Liberal government in its spring budget. The government said it has made progress on cutting the deficit by finding $3.2 billion in efficiencies in operations, including a hiring freeze across the public service.\n\nLiberal Leader and MPP John Fraser alleged in comments to reporters that the PCs are \"intentionally inflating\" budget numbers to justify steep cuts in the forthcoming spring budget.\n\n\"The numbers just don't add up. They don't add up at all,\" he said.\n\nThough it is spending less, the government said it is also taking in $2.7 billion less in revenue in the fiscal year \u2014 including $1.5 billion attributed to the cancellation of the province's cap-and-trade program.\n\nThe outlook did not include a projected timeline for a return to a balanced budget.\n\nFocus on Toronto\n\nFord has spent considerable energy on Toronto-centric initiatives during his time as premier, and the economic preview expanded on that theme.\n\nLegislation tabled alongside Thursday's outlook, Bill 57, includes clauses that dissolve the corporation and public board that currently oversee management of Ontario Place, an underused entertainment venue that sits on prime waterfront real estate. The act would transfer all assets to the Crown.\n\n\"Ontario Place has the potential to become a spectacular world-class, year-round destination,\" the government wrote in the economic preview document.\n\nHorwath, however, said the move could be the first-step toward selling Ontario Place to private interests.\n\nThe Tory plan will transfer Ontario Place, an underused entertainment venue on prime lakefront real estate, to the Crown.\n\n\"It will be easier to sell if it is entirely owned by the Crown,\" she said, adding that the current public board would present an obstacle to doing just that.\n\nBill 57 also expands the jurisdiction of Metrolinx, the Toronto-area's transportation agency, to include a host of new regions. Further, it eliminates the existing requirement that development plans from Metrolinx must consider all forms of transportation.\n\nThe legislation would ultimately give the minister of transportation more control of Metrolinx's governance, and would also allow the minister to appoint a representative to the organization's board of directors.\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Former Hawkesbury teacher charged with sexual assault", "description": "A former high school teacher in Hawkesbury, Ont., has been charged with sexual assault after allegations of abuse dating back to the early 1980s surfaced.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/adrien-asselin-hawkesbury-charge-1.4906981", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1550313.1380774675!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hi-opp-logo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:32:57Z", "content": "A former high school teacher in Hawkesbury, Ont., has been charged with sexual assault after allegations of abuse dating back to the early 1980s surfaced.

Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, joined other lawmakers and representatives of the Urban Indian Health Institute to review the report's findings at a news conference in Washington.\n\nIts release comes as multiple bills at the state and federal level have been proposed to address the issue and improve data collection, including Savanna's Act, which the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs voted Wednesday to send to the full chamber for consideration.\n\nThe bill would expand tribal access to some federal crime databases, establish protocols for handling cases of missing and murdered Native Americans, and require annual reports on the number of missing and murdered Native American women.\n\n\"We simply don't have a grasp of the extent of the problem we're dealing with,\" Murkowski said. \"Making sure that we do not have these gaps in reporting is going to be a critical and important first step.\"\n\n500 cases identified\n\nThe authors of the Seattle nonprofit's report said they identified some 500 missing persons and homicide cases involving Native American women in 71 cities after reviewing data obtained through media reports and public records requests sent to police departments.\n\nThey reviewed cases dating back to the 1940s, though roughly two-thirds were from the past eight years, according to Annita Lucchesi, a cartographer and descendant of the Southern Cheyenne whose database of missing and murdered Indigenous women in the U.S. and Canada was the basis for the research.\n\nIn total, she has a list of some 2,700 names. Of the cases included in the report on U.S. cities, a quarter represented missing persons cases, and just more than half were homicides.\n\nResearchers said they expect their figures represent an undercount, in part, because some police departments in cities with substantial Native American populations \u2014 such as Albuquerque, N.M., and Billings, Mont. \u2014 did not provide figures in response to records requests, or because Native American victims may have been identified as belonging to another race.\n\nPolice in Albuquerque and Billings did not immediately respond to The Associated Press's requests for comment.\n\n\"What it does show is, yes, this is happening,\" said Abigail Echo-Hawk, who is the director of the Urban Indian Health Institute. \"But there has to be major changes to the way data is collected.\"\n\nCalls for annual reports\n\nSome efforts to improve data collection at different levels of government are already underway.\n\nIn Washington state, for example, a law was enacted in June that requires the State Patrol to conduct a study to examine how to improve the collection and sharing of information about missing Native American women. The study also will develop an estimate of how many Native women are missing in the state. A report to the Legislature is expected in June.\n\nPeople holding banners march for Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind in St. Paul, Minn., in August 2017.

Savanna's Act is among several proposals drafted to address cases involving missing and murdered Native American and Alaska Native women. (Leila Navidi/Star Tribune via The Associated Press)\n\nIn Congress, meanwhile, Savanna's Act is among several proposals drafted to address cases involving missing and murdered Native American and Alaska Native women.\n\nA proposal for reauthorizing the Violence Against Women's Act also calls for annual reports on the number of missing and murdered Native Americans.\n\nSavanna's Act was introduced last year by North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat who lost her bid for re-election last week. She named the bill Savanna's Act in honour of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a 22-year-old who was brutally killed in Fargo, N.D., in 2017 while eight months pregnant.\n\nMore accurate statistics could show patterns\n\nHer neighbour Brooke Crews admitted to the killing and was sentenced to life in prison without parole earlier. Her boyfriend William Hoehn was sentenced last month to life in prison with a chance at parole for conspiring to kidnap the baby and lying to police about it.\n\nThe child survived and lives with her father.\n\nHeitkamp has said that if authorities had more accurate statistics, they might be able to detect patterns to help solve more cases. The authors of the nonprofit's report share that opinion, but also point out that the legislation's data collection mandates likely would not include LaFontaine-Greywind herself.\n\nThat's because the bill would largely set mandates for federal law enforcement, which has some jurisdiction over crimes on reservations and other tribal lands but not municipalities, like Fargo.\n\nThe report underscores U.S. Census figures showing that a majority of Native Americans now live in urban areas. The study said that shows the need for including consideration of cases stemming from cities in reforms."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Cocaine, cash, crossbow and rifle seized in northern Manitoba raids", "description": "Six people are behind bars in Thompson, Man., after police raids at two homes turned up cocaine, cash and weapons.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/cocaine-cash-weapons-thompson-manitoba-1.4906963", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4906994.1542302768!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/guns-drugs-seized-by-rcmp.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:38:37Z", "content": "Six people are behind bars in Thompson, Man., after police raids at two homes turned up cocaine, cash and weapons.

Whatever fell, fell.\"\n\nIf the report, which is expected in a couple days, says the building must come down, the city will move to demolish it and try to recoup the costs from the owner. Sbrissa could challenge such a move in court.\n\nOn Thursday, city officials assured committee members that the building is inspected on a daily basis and poses no imminent danger to the public.\n\nThe sidewalk in front of Magee House on Wellington Street W. has been closed since late July.

Scott Moffatt appeared frustrated during Thursday's meeting, asking why Sbrissa was getting the benefit of the doubt. \"He doesn't deserve any,\" he said.\n\nThe owner is standing in the way of that, and the city should be able to do what we have to do to remedy the situation. - Coun . Scott Moffatt\n\n\"It's a public safety issue,\" Moffatt said after the meeting. \"You have a sidewalk closed. You have businesses impacted. You have residents impacted. It's wrong. The building should be down by now. The owner is standing in the way of that, and the city should be able to do what we have to do to remedy the situation.\"\n\nCoun. Jeff Leiper, who represents the area where Magee House is located, said he's heard complaints from residents and businesspeople concerned about safety and walkability near the damaged building.\n\n\"I think that it is obvious to residents that the weather is not going to do that building any favours. We're in for a big dump of snow this evening,\" Leiper said.\n\n\"It's not a light matter for a government to go in and demolish somebody's private property,\" he said.

(Rafferty Baker/CBC)\n\nThe drug supply is poisoned with fentanyl. Should the federal government be pushing for decriminalization or legalization of all illicit drugs so that it can control the drugs being consumed?\n\nDecriminalization would be a good first step because it would address the stigma associated with drug use. But decriminalization alone will not change the toxic drug supply.\n\nThe only way to do that is to have a legal regulatory approach to all illegal substances.\n\nIf this was something different than addiction and illicit drugs \u2014 if this was another disease altogether and it was killing more than 100 people per month \u2014 how would the response to it be different?\n\nIf we had people getting sick and dying because there was a toxic substance in the food supply, we would take immediate action. We would take that food off the shelf and replace it with something that wasn't causing illness.\n\nThe problem is the fact that this is occurring because of changes to the illegal drug supply. And it's what's made it so challenging to take the kind of steps needed to make a difference.\n\nWhat role does stigma continue to play in the approach to this crisis?\n\nIt plays a huge role.\n\nWe know that 90 per cent of people who are dying are dying indoors. Most of those people are consuming alone. That may be associated with the stigma associated with drug use. They don't want to admit to their family, to their friends, that they have a problem. They may not want to come to an overdose prevention site where they can consume their drugs under observation.\n\nPart of it is having a better understanding of opioid use disorder as a medical condition. We can't blame them for this. We can't blame them when they relapse. It's a part of the treatment.\n\nWe need to get past that.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the impact this is having on the frontline workers?\n\nThe crisis was declared three years ago, so there has been burn out.\n\nWe shouldn't forget the peer workforce who have been instrumental in the response. They have been working in many of the overdose prevention sites, so they see the impact of the crisis every day and, in addition, they're losing their friends or relatives to overdose deaths.\n\nWe need to recognize, as a community, that this is all our problem.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.

They are changing the course of evolutionary history for all species on the planet. - Sarah Otto, biologist\n\n\"It's a reshaping of the tree of life,\" said Sarah Otto, a University of British Columbia researcher, whose paper was published Wednesday by the London-based Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\nOtto, a much-awarded and highly regarded theoretical biologist, says the activities and presence of human beings have become one of the largest drivers of evolutionary change everywhere on the planet.\n\n\"Human impacts on the world are not just local,\" she said. \"They are changing the course of evolutionary history for all species on the planet, and that's a remarkable concept to ponder.\"\n\nSwallows are evolving smaller, more manoeuvrable wings to help them dodge buildings and vehicles, the study says. (Don Ryan/Canadian Press/AP)\n\nEarth scientists have long discussed the idea of the Anthropocene \u2014 a period of Earth's history defined by geological markers of human impact. Otto, after reviewing dozens of research papers, concludes the planet's biology is becoming similarly marked as plants and animals respond to human pressure.\n\nHer paper is replete with examples from bird species slowly forgetting to migrate to mosquito breeds adapted specifically to underground subway tunnels.\n\nBackyard bird feeders are behind changes in the beak shape and strength of house finches. Different mammals are becoming nocturnal as a way to avoid human conflict. Introduced species change the ground rules for native plants and animals.\n\nIt's a mistake to think evolution requires millennia, said Otto.\n\n\"Evolution happens really fast if the selection regimes are strong. We can see sometimes in plant populations evolutionary change in the course of years.\"\n\nIf the changes come too fast for evolution to keep up, there's always extinction.\n\nRates of species loss are now estimated to be 1,000 times higher than they were before human domination. More than one in five of all plant and animal species are considered at risk.\n\nExtinctions have always happened. But Otto said they're happening at such a pace and in response to such similar pressures that they are reducing the ability of evolution to respond to change.\n\n\"We're losing the ability for evolution to bounce back.\"\n\nIrreversible changes\n\nForcing species into a human-formed box reduces variability, leaving evolution less to work with in response to future changes. And wiping species out removes them forever.\n\n\"If we're eliminating the large-bodied mammals, even if humans went extinct on the planet, we're not going to see an immediate return of ecosystems to have the right balance of small, medium and large species,\" Otto said.\n\n\"We're cutting off options. We're cutting off options both within species by eliminating variability, and we're also cutting off options at the tree of life level by cutting off species.\"\n\nSpecies that are doing well as a result of human influence are animals as coyotes or rats that are less fussy about where they live and what they eat. (Getty Images)\n\nSpecies that are doing well are generalists \u2014 crows, coyotes, dandelions.\n\n\"The ones that can both tolerate and thrive in human-altered environments,\" said Otto. \"The pigeons and the rats.\"\n\nThe biggest single human-caused evolutionary pressure, Otto said, is climate change.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing we have to do is tackle climate change.

Manitoba took a step further and required pot to be in a secure compartment, such as the trunk.\n\nPassengers ticketed\n\nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, there have been at least six charges related to open or accessible cannabis in vehicles, RCMP said.\n\nObviously drivers can't consume weed, but many provinces, including British Columbia and Ontario, have banned passengers from toking as well.

That's compared to 60 incidents of drug impairment in drivers and 1,154 instances of alcohol impairment in all of 2017.\n\nIn Halifax and the Northwest Territories, there were no cannabis-impaired driving arrests in the three weeks before or after legalization, while in Nunavut, there were five general impaired-driving charges during both periods.\n\nSgt.

The department said it would also let inmates have visitation and greater access to programming.\n\nThe review of administrative segregation is still being review, Parsons said.\n\nAsked if it's possible to fully eliminate segregation at HMP, Parsons said the answer is likely no.\n\n\"That's a difficult question, and one that's probably better answered by our administrator there, Mr. Don Roche and all the people who work there,\" Parsons said.\n\n\"I'd bet the answer would probably be no. The complete elimination is not possible. Would we like to? Of course.

Retailers previously had to constantly monitor the AGLC's website.\n\nAs soon as something was restocked, whichever retailer was online and watching could place their order, often depleting stock almost instantly.\n\nIt worked similarly to Ticketmaster \u2014 some pot shops may have missed out on ordering the extremely limited amounts of cannabis if they didn't have the resources to constantly monitor the website.\n\nThe new system evens the playing field, AGLC spokesperson Chara Goodings said.\n\nSmaller stores will have as much of an opportunity to buy cannabis as the bigger ones, and stock will be distributed more evenly.\n\n\"Everyone will have an opportunity to have product. It may not be as much as they want or the SKUs (stock keeping unit) that they want, but at least everyone will have something,\" she said.\n\n\"That's why we're doing it, is to make sure that everyone has a fair opportunity to get product.\"\n\n'Definitely good for us private guys'\n\nThere are currently 65 licensed retail cannabis stores in Alberta, but not all of them have been able to open due to extreme shortages of cannabis available from the AGLC, the province's only wholesaler.\n\nSupply issues have plagued the province \u2014 and the entire country \u2014 since legalization last month.\n\nGoodings could not confirm exactly how much cannabis or which strains were available as of Wednesday for retailers to order, but said the supply remains very limited.\n\nFor Albertans wanting to buy cannabis for themselves, only eight of 85 strains of dried flower were in stock Wednesday on albertacannabis.org.\n\nGoodings said the AGLC ordered enough cannabis from licensed producers to last an estimated six months but it received \"significantly\" less.\n\n\"We have contacted every single licensed producer in Canada to see if we can secure even a minimal amount of product. And there is really just nothing extra to be had,\" she said.\n\nNick McGahey opened Bud Runners Cannabis in Peace River on Tuesday.\n\nHe got lucky with ordering on the previous system, he said. He opened his doors with 30 different products on shelves.\n\nI think it's a good thing. It'll definitely help even it out, because now we know how much inventory is in AGLC's warehouse and we're able to order based on that and then they divide that up. - Nick McGahey, cannabis store owner\n\nTo get that product, his business partner, Cody Gerk, was glued to his computer screen.\n\n\"It was just being diligent online there and being on every hour, every day and just checking the product inventory,\" McGahey said.\n\n\"Once he saw it was available, he'd pick it up and get as much as he could. It was just good timing.\"\n\nThey sold out of one product their first day open and are running low on others already.\n\nMcGahey said the new ordering system benefits smaller stores like his, even if they might not be able to get everything they ask for.\n\n\"It's definitely good for us private guys that aren't the big chains, like Fire and Flower and Nova. We don't have the man power to be as diligent as they are and we don't have the supply agreements with the producers,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's a good thing. It'll definitely help even it out, because now we know how much inventory is in AGLC's warehouse and we're able to order based on that and then they divide that up.\n\n\"What we order we might not get, but it just makes it a little more fair, a little more even.\"\n\nGoodings said this system will remain in place for the coming weeks or months until a significantly greater amount of stock becomes available.\n\nIn the meantime, the AGLC continues to issue licences for retail cannabis stores. Goodings said this doesn't mean there will be enough product to stock them, but retailers are aware of that.\n\n\"If there are more producers that get licensed through Health Canada that we are able to get product from, we might be able to revert back to the original process a lot sooner,\" she said.\n\n\"If we continue in this state of this supply shortage, we don't know how long it will last for.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC Sports", "title": "Watch World Cup speed skating from Japan", "description": "Watch live action from the speed skating World Cup stop in Obihiro, Japan, including Canadian stars Ivanie Blondin and Ted-Jan Bloemen.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/speedskating/world-cup-speed-skating-obihiro-1.4905028", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4905040.1542214649!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ted-jan-bloemen.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:14:13Z", "content": "To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

The funding will roll out over seven years.\n\nThe federal government will launch a bidding process to assess First Nation and Inuit police service facilities, which will help guide the selection of phase two infrastructure projects.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the First Nations Policing Program serves about 400,000 people in 450 communities through \"culturally relevant\" policing.\n\n\"Building on our government's major investments in new officers, salaries and equipment, we are making new investments in policing facilities so officers can do their jobs properly and keep their communities safe,\" he said in a statement.\n\nIndigenous forces complain of underfunding\n\nThe money announced today comes on top of the $291 million over five years Goodale announced earlier this year for First Nations policing operations. That announcement came after years of complaints and legal challenges from Indigenous police forces that claim they've been chronically underfunded.\n\nAt the time, Goodale said the figure nearly triples the basic amount earmarked in 2017, representing the largest federal financial commitment since 1991.\n\nThe money will go toward improving salaries, hiring new officers and buying new equipment.

Tania Vaughan said community constables are meant to enhance, not replace, existing RCMP services in a community.\n\n\"At this time, the community constable program remains a pilot program, and no final decision on its future has been made,\" she said in an email. \"The purpose of the evaluation was to provide senior management with a neutral, timely and evidence-based assessment of the pilot program to help inform decision-making on its permanency. The RCMP is now better informed in order to enhance the CC Program, and make changes to it that will better serve our communities.\"\n\nVaughan said the RCMP is responding to the evaluation by responding to questions and concerns from the community constables and developing a clearly defined program mandate.

Forbes has mastered the gentle technique of frying battered fish.\n\nScott Forbes, the owner of Hammerhead's in Hamilton. (Suresh Doss)\n\n\"In my opinion, the way to tell that you have good fish and chips is that the batter should be slightly translucent. You should be able to see the skin of the fish with a gentle coating of batter around it. You want to taste fish, not batter,\" Forbes said.\n\nThe other key to making good fried fish is the heat of the oil. If it's not hot enough the oil will cling to the batter, giving the diner an unpleasant eating experience.\n\nNearly everything in Forbes's kitchen is gluten-free except for the malt vinegar. His third technique is to dunk each chunk of fish through house-made batter and then coat it in flour before \"taking it for one last swim\" through hot oil.\n\nForbes will slowly drag the fish across the hot oil a few times before he gently drops it into the fryer. This helps form a thin crust without disrupting the batter shell.\n\nEvery plate of fish and chips I have had at Hammerhead's has restored my faith in the the classic pub meal. If it's your first time, go for the pickerel. While its not as fatty as halibut, I find it incredibly juicy with a slight hint of sweetness tucked under a crisp batter envelope.\n\nHammerhead's calamari is chunks of squid soaked in buttermilk overnight. It's coated in a spicy chili sauce and served with coleslaw. (Suresh Doss)\n\nVenturing beyond the traditional pub fare, there are two other dishes that are notable at Hammerhead's. Forbes has calamari on the menu. He soaks chunks of squid in buttermilk overnight. The squid pieces are bathed and fried similar to the fish. The buttermilk makes the squid tender. He coats the finished product in a spicy chili sauce.\n\n\"It's my east meets west treatment,\" he said.\n\nLook close enough on the menu and you'll notice a corner dedicated to curries. Forbes wanted to highlight his time spent in Toronto kitchens by honouring the Sri Lankan cooks he worked with. There's a Jaffna-style fish curry where he cooks chunks of fish with a darkened masala and some coconut milk.\n\nHammerhead's serves up a Jaffna-style fish curry. (Suresh Doss)\n\nIf you want some fish curry, but with less heat, go for the masala curry made in an Indian manner with more coconut milk to soften the blow of the peppers and spices.\n\nWe have an abundance of fish and chips places throughout the GTA, but for consistency and a memorable plate that brings me back to my childhood, I will happily drive out to The Hammer."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC Sports", "title": "Hockey Night in Canada podcast: Jayna Hefford, Brian Burke on everything Hall of Fame", "description": "In this week's episode of the Hockey Night in Canada podcast we take a look at the 2018 HHOF induction class.

Last week, the wind chill was brutal -- minus 26 degrees.But the animals weren't bothered by the cold -- they were focused on their meal. Looking at the animals, you'd never know that they have only lived together for a couple of weeks. Festus the donkey was desperately lonely and Peggy the horse was set to be euthanized.But a chance meeting in October saved them both. 6:56\n\nPam Johnson's niece had packed up her horses and moved them to Ontario on Oct. 11.

Grant and her husband Larry were downsizing from a farm to a home in town. They had two horses. One had to be euthanized because he was old, arthritic and in poor health, but Peggy was still very healthy.\n\nGrant wasn't willing to sell Peggy for fear of her ending up on a slaughter line.\n\nThat's when Grant and Johnson say fate intervened.\n\nDeLee Grant was losing hope that she's find a new home for her 24-year-old horse, Peggy. She had booked an appointment to euthanize Peggy when she met Pam Johnson. (Sam Maciag/CBC Saskatchewan)\n\nPart of the downsizing for Grant included a big move. Grant ended up breaking a vertebra in her back during the process and had to have surgery. After about a week she was feeling good enough to tag along with her husband into Regina one afternoon. They stopped at the Dollar Store and bumped into a woman named Yvonne Schalk.\n\nThe whole move has been very stressful and this is the happiest moment of my entire life to find a home for Peggy. - DeLee Grant\n\n\"I told her that I was feeling pretty bad because I was going to have to put my horse down,\" Grant said.\n\nSchalk told Grant about Johnson and Festus.

Festus is no longer depressed and Peggy was saved from being euthanized.

Of those cases, 56 per cent were already metastatic at diagnosis.\n\n'We know it's not a one-size-fits-all'\n\nIn order to make a change for pancreatic cancer patients across North America, they're taking a page out of the book of breast cancer advocates through their PanGen project.\n\n\"The goal is to better understand what drives the pancreatic cancer so they can start characterizing the cancer to find new treatments,\" she said.\n\nCapobianco said that with breast cancer there has been targeted therapy for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and for bracket two sub-types and beyond.\n\n\"That's what we want to do for pancreatic cancer, start sub-typing so we can find the right cure for each person.

(Vanessa Blanch/CBC)\n\nLeBlanc said \"people are very desperate,\" but it's important to keep them out of these properties for their own safety, and the safety of others in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe CBC's Vanessa Blanch goes out with Moncton fire marshal Charles LeBlanc, who shows her some of the boarded up rooming houses that are targets for homeless people in the city desperate for shelter. 9:59\n\n\"We do have some homeless people that would like to get in \u2026 they will use all sorts of different things to try to keep warm, from starting fires inside to a number of different things that are very dangerous.\"\n\n\"Sometimes yes, we're here... 10, 15 times a week but it's well worth it to ensure the safety of the public.\"\n\nNeighbours feel 'threatened'\n\nAt another large old home on King Street that's been boarded up, LeBlanc checks to make sure it is still secure.\n\nLeBlanc inspects a vacant rooming house near Mountain Road. He would like to work with property owners to bring these abandoned homes up to an 'acceptable standard' but said many aren't willing to do the work. (Vanessa Blanch/CBC)\n\nNeighbour Lina LeBlanc, who was on her way back from the grocery store, stops to tell him that three people, who looked like they had spent the night in the backyard, walked out an hour earlier, as she passed by.\n\n\"We're now at a point that we'll likely be looking at having this building demolished because it is that dangerous,\" Charles LeBlanc said.\n\n\"This particular property was used for drugs and also prostitution,\" he said. \"This is a property, unfortunately, that we had to evict a number of tenants due to a lot of extremely dangerous situations inside.\"\n\nAmong the nine people evicted when the fire department closed the building were a mother and her daughter.\n\n\"On that day it was very, very difficult for them,\" LeBlanc said. \"It was difficult for myself and my officers that were here but by the end of the day they did find a much better place for her daughter and for herself.\"\n\nThe homes in this neighbourhood are close together, and LeBlanc is concerned that a fire in the abandoned fourplex could easily lead to the loss of the entire block.\n\nLina LeBlanc lives next to a vacant rooming house and there is one behind her downtown home. She said her shed was broken into four times over the summer, and she is hoping the city can do something to help people who are homeless. (Vanessa Blanch/CBC)\n\nLina LeBlanc, who lives with her elderly mother, is worried too. She said the abandoned houses in the area are becoming \"more and more of an issue.\"\n\nWith one next door to her home, and another across the street, she has felt threatened by the people who break into the boarded up buildings nearby.\n\n\"Last summer every time they would break into the house next door, they'd break into my baby barn. So my baby barn got broken into four times last summer.\"\n\nI'm choking up a little bit. It's like this every day. - Charles LeBlanc , Moncton Fire Prevention\n\n\"At the end I just wanted to say, 'You can break in but you've taken everything that there is to be taken.'\"\n\nLina LeBlanc said all of her tools were stolen, along with her ladder and recyclables. Her brother lost a box of Boston Red Sox memorabilia he had been storing there.\n\nThe backyards of vacant buildings attract people without homes. Charles LeBlanc said the debris and garbage left behind only add to the fire risk. (Vanessa Blanch/CBC)\n\n\"Not a good feeling \u2026 always kind of walking on eggshells, keeping an eye out on the properties and not wanting to say that I am putting my nose in other people's business.\"\n\n'It's like this every day'\n\nAs Charles LeBlanc pulled into the driveway of another boarded up home on Botsford, a shopping cart, some clothes and a homemade tent, camouflaged with branches, were visible in the brush between the backyard and the train tracks.\n\nThis is where Donald Morel, who is in a great deal of pain from bone cancer, has been living for the past two weeks.\n\nDonald Morel survived outside in homemade tents like this one for the better part of the past three years. He has bone cancer and lost his job as a roofer after he passed out at work. He recently got into a special care home. (Vanessa Blanch/CBC)\n\nMorel has been on the streets for most of the past three years. He lost his job as a roofer after he passed out, and emergency responders had to be called in to get him down.\n\n\"I'm not allowed to work anymore so that's why I'm finding it hard to survive. You don't want to die under a pile of snow.\"\n\nMorel built his tent from a rubber tarp he found in the street, some house wrap that blew off the old Moncton High School and some scavenged wood and branches.\n\nHe has been staying warm with an old propane barbecue that he keeps in a metal bucket.\n\nLast week, Morel was placed in a special care home and said he is \"so happy.\"\n\nEven though LeBlanc sees poor people in bad situations every day, it's still hard for him to see someone like Morel trying to survive.\n\n\"You see a gentleman like Don \u2014 it's heartbreaking,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter how many times you do it \u2026 I'm choking up a little bit. It's like this every day.\"\n\nCharles LeBlanc and members of the Moncton FIre Department keep an eye on homeless people in the city, like Donald Morel. (Vanessa Blanch/CBC)\n\n\"Every person and every tenant that I deal with, I try to deal with them the way I would want to be dealt with if I was ever in that situation or any of my relatives.\"\n\nLeBlanc gives credit to all of the non-profit organizations in Moncton that are working to help homeless citizens but said it is clear more must be done.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the answer is \u2026 whether it's different levels of government, but as a community and on the humanity side of things, I think we definitely can do better.\"\n\nImprovements possible\n\nWith 27 vacant buildings in the city, LeBlanc said the goal is always to work with the property owners to make improvements.\n\nMany of them think that the buildings must be brought up to current building codes, but that is not the case.\n\n\"We understand that these are older buildings and we never ask for these buildings to come back to today's code,\" he said. \"We will work with them to bring it back to an acceptable standard.\"\n\nThis duplex is an example of a home that is being improved by the owner after the Fire Department evicted the tenants. LeBlanc says when his team was called in, there were 22 people living inside the building, which was being used for prostitution. (Vanessa Blanch/CBC)\n\nAn acceptable standard is typically achieved by resolving structural issues, ensuring there are safe exits and \"a few improvements such as smoke detectors,\" which are \"relatively inexpensive.\"\n\nLeBlanc said his ultimate goal is to have buildings open and available for rent.\n\n\"If, for example, this is a duplex, it's for this building to be a duplex again and that people can live here. As long as this building is vacant it takes occupancy away from citizens of Moncton.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Joel Ballard", "title": "Hundreds of noisy, smelly sea lions fill Cowichan Bay \u2014 to the delight of many", "description": "Hundreds of sea lions descended upon the waters of Cowichan Bay on Vancouver Island this fall.

He said his deed proves he also owns the white triangle with the blue line beside it. (Mark Crosby/CBC)\n\nCraig bought his home in 1981 on a half hectare piece of land in Northwest Cove currently assessed at $124,000. At the time of the purchase, his title searcher discovered the property's deed was incorrect and was missing a boundary line. Instead of a rectangle, the property was a triangle. So the deed was amended and the missing boundary line restored.\n\nCraig said he was unaware of any problems until he applied to have a septic system installed in 2016. The Department of Environment rejected his request, saying he didn't own some of the land where he planned to place the system.\n\nIt turns out his neighbour, whose land surrounds much of Craig's property, had surveyed their property in 1974. That survey, based on the old deed and missing a property line, was registered with the province. It shows half Craig's deeded property belongs to the neighbour.\n\nEven the executive director of the Nova Scotia Association of Land Surveyors thinks the survey is questionable.\n\n\"It would appear that the survey was based on that deed and that there was an omission of one particular course,\" Fred Hutchinson said in an interview.\n\nCraig recently had a surveyor retrace his boundaries in an effort to prove he owns the land described in his deed. (Mark Crosby/CBC)\n\nBut Craig's request to have the mapping changed to reflect his deed and remove the incorrect survey was rejected by Peter Craig (no relation), a senior mapper with the Lunenburg County Land Registration Office.\n\nIn an email, Dennis Craig was informed it is \"accepted practice\" to use the survey to map the property online \"as it would have more weight in this instance than the description of the property.\"\n\n\"Although your description appears to possibly describe the property in a different configuration than we have mapped, we have a registered survey plan on file which appears to show the configuration as we have it mapped,\" Peter Craig wrote.\n\nThe surveyor who Dennis Craig says produced the inaccurate survey has died, so there is no opportunity to present him with evidence to amend his work.\n\nInstead, Norman Hill, the executive director of the province's registries, told Craig in an email to do his own survey and get a boundary line agreement from the neighbour so the mapping can be corrected. Hill told Craig his land is mapped the way it is \"because his neighbour's survey is the best evidence we have of where the boundaries are.\"\n\nThe Miller family, which owns the neighbouring land, say they sympathize with Craig, but disagree with his position. Lawson Miller said his family feels the 1974 survey is an accurate representation.\n\nCraig has hired a surveyor and plans to register the work so the land will be shown as \"disputed.\" His only other option is to take his neighbour to Nova Scotia Supreme Court and ask a judge to set the boundary, something that could take years and cost thousands of dollars.\n\nN.B. has process to resolve disputes\n\nCraig's lawyer wrote to the Association of Nova Scotia Land Surveyors alleging \"negligence\" by the surveyor who left out the boundary line, and questioning who was going to pay Craig's legal bills and the cost of a new survey.\n\nThe association responded by pointing out there is a 15-year statute of limitations on such claims, but acknowledged there is \"absolutely\" a problem with how the land titles office deals with discrepancies.\n\n\"It's very, very important that we are able to determine where properties are and the accuracy of the mapping,\" Hutchinson said in an interview.\n\nHe cites what New Brunswick is doing as a possible solution. That province has a system where the registrar general of land titles will hear from owners locked in a property dispute and then rule on where the boundary should be. The aim is to avoid the expense of going to court and to resolve situations more quickly.\n\nCraig wants to see Nova Scotia adopt something similar. His only recourse right now it to go to court, and he feels like he's \"kind of dead in the water.\"\n\nHutchinson said information on the New Brunswick initiative was sent to the Nova Scotia government a year-and-a-half to two years ago, but so far \"there's been no response, really.\"\n\nSystem needs support\n\nHe calls Nova Scotia's land registration system \"one of the best in the country,\" but said it has not had the financial or staffing support it should have over the past several years.\n\nHe also points out there is no land surveyor on staff at the land registry, someone who could \"review survey plans or have any kind of authority to ferret out issues that could be resolved.\"\n\n\"That would be nice if the registrar general, with the support of a land surveyor, had the authority to make a decision on which plan supersedes the other,\" he said.\n\nCatherine Walker, a lawyer who specializes in property law, feels an alternative to court would be useful for property disputes.\n\n\"The more dispute resolution mechanisms we have outside court, the better for everyone,\" she said in an interview.\n\nService Nova Scotia Minister Geoff MacLellan doesn't seem convinced. He said last week there are no plans to change the way the land registration system operates \"from a policy or a law perspective.\"\n\nHe maintains boundary disputes need to be ironed out by the courts, leaving Craig and his neighbour in limbo."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Michael Gorman", "title": "Nova Scotia now publicly reporting number of abuse allegations in care homes", "description": "There were 20 founded cases of abuse at special care facilities licensed by Nova Scotia's Department of Community Services in 2017-18, according to data the province is now publicly releasing.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/special-needs-community-services-government-1.4904570", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4905148.1542216766!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/abuse-stock.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:00:00Z", "content": "There were 20 founded cases of abuse at special care facilities licensed by Nova Scotia's Department of Community Services in 2017-18.

I wondered if it would still be the same cast of characters rising to the top when the ISU decided to press the reset button on the world records or if there is room for rising stars to leave their mark.\n\nIn the men's event, the numbers tell the tale. Two-time Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan leads the way in highest overall, short and free program scores. With one Grand Prix gold already under his belt, Hanyu is assured a spot at the Grand Prix Final in Vancouver if he finishes no lower than second. Truthfully, I predict he will come no lower than first.\n\nHanyu puts on masterful performance in Helsinki:\n\nThe two-time reigning Olympic champion landed four quadruple jumps, and won by almost 40 points with a total score of 297.12 at the ISU Grand Prix in Helsinki. 7:12\n\nWhat does this mean for the rest of the field? Canada's Keegan Messing is up to the podium challenge. Messing has been nothing if not consistent and strong in this early part of the season \u2014 finishing with a silver medal at Skate Canada \u2014 and has a reputation that puts him in the mix with the world's elite skaters.\n\nA couple of names jump off the page that are worth keeping an eye on, and one in particular has piqued my interest. Julian Zhi Jie Yee from Malaysia had the short program of his life at Skate America to sit third place headed into the free. Nerves seemed to get the better of Yee as he finished seventh overall. He has the potential to head to the podium if his mental game can hold up.\n\nSpeaking of holding up, Olympic champion Alina Zagitova is looking to add another Grand Prix gold medal in Russia and clinch a spot for the Vancouver final. It would take extraordinary circumstances, like an illness, or extraordinary performances on the part of another skater, the likes of which is hard to imagine, for this to not happen.\n\nMessing claims silver at Skate Canada:\n\nCanada's Keegan Messing earned silver in the men's event at Skate Canada International in Laval, Que. 0:30\n\nMako Yamashita from Japan has a silver from Skate Canada, Russia's Sofia Samodurova has a bronze from Skate America and American Gracie Gold has a silver from the only time that she competed in the Rostelecom Cup in 2012. In other words, there are talented skaters headed to Moscow, but who will rise to the challenge remains to be seen.\n\nWhat is interesting about the pairs event is the top two teams have left themselves lots of room to grow and improve coming into the Russian Grand Prix. If I had to choose, my vote would be for the elegant Russian team of Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov who already have a gold medal from Skate America.\n\nThis doesn't mean Italian rivals Monica Della Monica and Matteo Guarise aren't up to the challenge. They are, and have the silver medal from the Grand Prix in Finland to prove it. Neither team has been perfect in competition. Moscow would be a good place to change that.\n\nOlympic champ Zagitova wins Helsinki Grand Prix:\n\nThe Russian and reigning Olympic champion Alina Zagitova finished with a total score of 215.29 points to win the women's competition at the ISU Grand Prix in Helsinki. 7:58\n\nEuropean bronze medallists from Russia, Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin, are the most well-known dancers in the field headed to Moscow. Stepanova and Bukin won bronze in their only other appearance at the Grand Prix of Russia a year ago and will presumably move up to take gold this year. If Stepanova and Bukin do take gold, that will mean a trip to the Grand Prix final for them by adding to the gold they already won in Helsinki.\n\nKeep your eye on the young American team of Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponamarenko. They are former two-time world junior medallists, silver Junior Grand Prix final medallists and two-time Challenger Series medallists so far this season.\n\nIn other words, I think this is a team on the move. It shouldn't surprise me, as Ponomarenko's parents are Marina Klimova and Sergei Ponomarenko, the 1992 Olympic ice dance champions, 1988 Olympic silver and 1984 Olympic bronze medallists.

There was the added challenge of trying to please multiple sides. Now that a draft compromise is on the table, most of those sides in Britain are up in arms.\n\n\"We're in the Brexs*it,\" screamed the Sun newspaper. \"May's soft Brexit deal blasted by all sides.\"\n\nFraught road ahead for May\n\nAt this late stage in a negotiation process that's lasted more than two years, May had hoped an ultimatum would save her and the draft she painstakingly reached with the EU: it's either this deal or chaos.\n\nBeyond walking away, it was the only tactic she had left.\n\nShe managed to get the 585-page compromise past her divided cabinet on Wednesday, clearing just one of several hurdles before it can be approved.\n\nWatch May's full statement after meeting with her cabinet Wednesday:\n\nU.K. prime minister tells reporters she has won the support of her cabinet for the agreement. She now faces the greater challenge of getting it approved by Parliament. 2:25\n\nBoth Wednesday and Thursday, May outlined the choices available: a deal \"which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our union; or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nThe deal as it stands sets out the terms of the divorce, which is set to happen on March 29: the $67-billion bill, and the protection of the rights of each other's citizens once the breakup happens. It would end free movement that is possible under the current relationship.\n\nThe most controversial are provisions that would temporarily keep the United Kingdom aligned with EU rules as long as necessary to avoid border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The deal also allows for the extension of the transition period as the two sides work out a new trading arrangement. The transition period is currently set for 21 months.\n\nThe Government has now published 3 key documents on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> deal: a draft Withdrawal Agreement <a href=\"https://t.co/OQ5elj9P8e\">https://t.co/OQ5elj9P8e</a>, an outline of the political declaration <a href=\"https://t.co/qdStEHrodt\">https://t.co/qdStEHrodt</a>, and an explainer on the Northern Ireland Protocol <a href=\"https://t.co/seb4IajHNF\">https://t.co/seb4IajHNF</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DNqIutZzel\">pic.twitter.com/DNqIutZzel</a> \u2014@commonslibrary\n\nIn the Commons on Thursday, she warned of the consequences of voting against the deal.\n\n\"Voting against a deal would take us all back to square one,\" she said. \"It would mean more uncertainty, more division, and a failure to deliver on the decision of the British people that we should leave the EU.\"\n\nLabour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party \"will not accept a false choice between this bad deal and no deal.\"\n\nIn an ominous sign for May, Nigel Dodds, an MP from the Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is propping up May's government, called on MPs to vote against the deal that amounts to a \"vassal state.\"\n\nSome suggested it was time to plan in earnest for a no-deal scenario.\n\nSuch arguments were heard on all sides of the House, strongly indicating Britain could be heading toward yet another political correction, one that the prime minister and her government may not survive.\n\nWith both the Labour Party and the DUP unhappy with the deal, an eventual vote in the Commons \u2014 if it even comes to that \u2014 could bring the entire thing down, taking May's premiership with it.\n\nEarlier, a former May chief of staff outlined his concerns in the Daily Telegraph.\n\n\"British compromises were inevitable,\" Nick Timothy wrote. \"But the proposal presented to cabinet is a capitulation \u2026 not only to Brussels, but to the fears of the British negotiators themselves.\"\n\nThe threat remained that more of her cabinet members will walk in protest, jeopardizing her government. Then the resignations started, first with Vara, who argued the deal puts the U.K. in a \"halfway house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation.\"\n\nBut Downing Street appears to be hoping that the looming uncertainty from a leadership contest or a general election this far down the Brexit road might persuade just enough MPs on all sides to accept the deal and move on.\n\nWith opposition among both remainers and Brexiteers, the math suggests otherwise.\n\nMeanwhile, a date has been set for an EU summit to consider the deal: Nov. 25. The U.K. House of Commons would then have to ratify it.\n\nAs the great unravelling continues, this is a union far more disunited over Brexit than the one it seeks to leave."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Rob Antle", "title": "NLESD wants friend of convicted employee ordered to return property from fraud case", "description": "The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District wants a judge to issue a recovery order for a shed and trailer it says has been \"unlawfully detained.\"", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nlesd-shed-trailer-court-application-unlawfully-detained-1.4904775", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4519854.1517834891!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/supreme-court-trial.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:30:00Z", "content": "Newfoundland and Labrador's largest school board wants to get back a shed and a trailer that are linked to a corruption case involving a former employee.

But down there in the flickering light, a once worthless metal known as cobalt has sat idle for decades. Now it's one of the most sought after metals in the world and that has many in this town in northern Ontario dreaming of boom times once again.\n\nA century ago, prospectors came to Cobalt, Ont., in search of silver. They found it, and the town boomed. Amid all the silver, miners also found cobalt. So much that they named the town after it. Back then though, it was a mere indicator, a sign that something of actual value was nearby.\n\nNow, all that ignored and discarded cobalt is the town's best hope.\n\n\"The potential here is huge,\" says Frank Basa, chief executive officer of Canada Cobalt Works.\n\nCobalt the metal has had a spectacular run over the past few years. And now Cobalt the town is poised to cash in.\n\nFrank Basa, chief executive of Canada Cobalt Works, poses outside the 100-year-old Castle Mine.

(Carly Thomas/CBC)\n\nThe metal has become a key component in the electric batteries that power our phones and our cars. Almost all of it is currently mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa.

Nobody wanted cobalt you see.\"\n\nBasa believes mining the mineral can return this region to its former glory.\n\nAn archival photo of an old mine during the silver rush in Cobalt. (\u00a9Cobalt Mining Museum)\n\nBack in the 1920s and '30s, this small town on the shores of Lake Timiskaming saw a silver mining rush. It became the economic hub of Ontario.\n\n\"They actually had an opera here,\" says Basa. \"They had a ballet, they had streetcars. The hockey team [the Cobalt Silver Kings] started here. The provincial police started here.\"\n\nVeterans of the silver rush remember those good times. They remember seeing lots of cobalt down in the silver mines, too.\n\nBill Montgomery made 58 cents an hour when he started working in the mines in the 1940s.\n\n\"Everybody was working. Everybody had a dollar in their pocket,\" he says of the town back then. \"Now we have nothing.\"\n\nThere hasn't been an operating mine here since the 1980s. Montgomery has heard a lifetime of promises from promoters and prospectors. After a career of tough work down in the mines, it would take a lot more than talk to get him excited. He just shrugs when asked if there's enough cobalt here to warrant a mine. \"It's hard to say, really.\"\n\nIt's not the retired miners' job to say, anyway. That task falls to people like Trent Mell. He's CEO of First Cobalt, another company scouring these old mines and the hills outside town.\n\nPeople in Cobalt pose behind a ton of pure silver drawn from a local mine. (\u00a9 Cobalt Mining Museum)\n\nMell has a map of the region on the wall of his office. Little red dots indicate drill sites where they've poked through the Canadian Shield looking for cobalt. He says there's no question it's out there. They named the town Cobalt, after all. The question is whether they can prove there's enough and that it's concentrated in a way that makes it profitable to dig it up and get it to market.\n\nHe says the drill results are encouraging.\n\n\"A lot of smoke, as they say. Now we have to find fire.\"\n\nMell knows the clock is ticking. The smartphone you have in your pocket likely has a few grams of cobalt in its battery. But pounds of the stuff are needed for an electric car. And with electric car sales soaring, demand for cobalt has spiked as well.\n\nTrent Mell, chief executive of First Cobalt, holds a sample of the metal in a northern Ontario shed. (Carly Thomas/CBC)\n\n\"As an industry, and as a cobalt explorer, we're playing catch-up,\" Mell says. \"You and I can decide tomorrow to go out and buy an electric vehicle. But as miners we can't respond quickly enough.\"\n\nThat potential shortage has driven up the price of cobalt. It was the best performing commodity in 2017. That means more money for exploration, and more companies competing to see if they can strike it rich.\n\nSo, First Cobalt is drilling 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They've searched through the old mines and have plotted a grid on Mell's map where they hope to find something where the first generation of miners didn't bother to look.\n\nDrillers extract a core sample while searching for traces of cobalt. (Carly Thomas/CBC)\n\nThe drill rig is hauled into a muddy opening. The crew performs like clockwork, feeding the drill bit into a hole, drilling down and pulling up core samples for testing. These core samples are pored over on site, sent back to town where they're cut up, and pieces are sent off to the lab. A new one is hauled out every 20 minutes or so.\n\nFirst Cobalt's vice-president, Frank Santaguida, pulls one dark piece of rock out of the tray. He reads the chunks of minerals like a coded language, looking for a sign. This one comes up empty, but each sample fills out the picture. Each piece tells him something about the search.\n\nAnd while miners are a skeptical lot, prospectors live on hope.\n\n\"It may be in the next drill hole,\" he says.\n\nA core sample is pulled out of the hills for testing near Cobalt. (Carly Thomas/CBC)\n\nEveryone in this region knows there's cobalt here, but its mere presence isn't enough. Opening a mine would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. So, there has to be just the right amount, in just the right concentration that would allow someone to come in and carve out a profit.\n\nIf the retired miners are skeptical by nature, the prospectors are the optimists, the enthusiastic believers that Cobalt can rise again. But for now, even as they dig through these hills, even as they see thick veins of cobalt running through old mines, they can only say \"maybe\" when asked if it will be enough."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Joe Vipond", "title": "The federal government's carbon pricing plan will eliminate Alberta's hard-earned climate gains", "description": "Climate and health will once again be jeopardized by coal combustion, at a time when cheap, emission-free alternatives exist.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/federal-carbon-pricing-1.4905481", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3547831.1522466958!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/air-pollution.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:00:00Z", "content": "Back in October, Justin Wheler, Executive Director of Regulatory and Compliance at Alberta Climate Change, told a symposium at the University of Alberta that if year to date trends hold, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity generation in the provin\u2026 [+4852 chars]", "fulltext": "Back in October, Justin Wheler, Executive Director of Regulatory and Compliance at Alberta Climate Change, told a symposium at the University of Alberta that if year to date trends hold, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity generation in the province are expected to decline by a net eight megatonnes for this calendar year. To put this in perspective, that is a three per cent reduction for the province, and an incredible one per cent for the entire nation \u2013 from one pricing policy, in one industry, in one province.\n\nShortly thereafter, the federal government announced its new pricing policy for the electricity sector, a backstop measure for those jurisdictions that do not adopt their own policy. The feds propose to use a complex economic device for large industries called an output based pricing system (OBPS), which is designed for emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\n\nLow-carbon transition\n\nThe policy, well explained by Canada's Ecofiscal Commission, means that emitters pay the full carbon price on their emissions, but then get a rebate back on emissions below a certain threshold, generally the average or best in class for the industry.\n\nThis has been shown to be equally effective as a flat carbon price as far as incenting reductions, while it also does not penalize emitters to the extent that they might move to a non-carbon pricing jurisdiction. It incentivizes low emitting plants while discouraging high emitting ones, supporting a low-carbon transition.\n\nIt is essentially the same system that Alberta implemented on Jan. 1, which has been so remarkably effective in reducing emissions. But the federal government is adding a twist by applying the benchmark for credits differently to different fuel sources (800 tonnes of CO2/MWh for coal, 370 tonnes of CO2/MWh for gas), meaning that gas has a much stricter limit applied to it than coal, despite being a much cleaner fuel. Renewable energy gets no added incentives (unlike the current Alberta pricing scheme) despite being emissions-free.\n\nThis seemingly small change will make a heck of a difference. It has been calculated by economist Blake Shaffer that the cleanest coal plants, despite being much much dirtier than gas, and much, much, much dirtier than renewables, will only pay the equivalent of $1 per tonne. In contrast, you and I, average Canadian citizens, will be paying a rate of $20 per tonne starting in 2019. With this thumb on the scale, coal plants will be incented to run before cleaner gas plants. And why rush to build new renewable energy when coal plants are going to be cheap enough to stay in the game for the long haul?\n\nWhy the discrepancy? Well, there's an election coming up, and surely there's concern about jurisdictions that continue to rely on coal as a fuel source paying so much in carbon pricing that their electricity prices would rise too high. So the federal government has opted to essentially subsidize coal burning instead.\n\nExcept, a long-term rise in electricity prices probably wouldn't happen. The whole point of pricing carbon is to motivate behavioural change, and that applies to big utilities as well as individuals. With recent wind prices being as low as 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, and solar prices plummeting below the cost of gas and even coal-fired electricity, it wouldn't be long before Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Alberta transition to a cleaner, and cheaper, electricity grid.\n\n'Climate change is real, people expect their governments to take action,' says the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 8:56\n\nBut what does this have to do with Alberta? Both the governing NDP and the poll-leading United Conservative Party leaders have vowed to cancel our own pricing regime, thus triggering the federal backstop (Rachel Notley in 2021 and Jason Kenney after the provincial election). Reverting to federal policy is projected to increase emissions from the sector by five to eight megatonnes per year, or an additional 100 megatonnes in total until the last coal plant closes in 2029. Added to this is the incredible uncertainty transmitted to our utility industry at a time when investments for the future must be planned.\n\nWith the production of GHGs from coal comes the production of other air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and particulate matter. As a physician, I have spent years fighting coal pollution from coal plants, which has been linked to at least 100 premature deaths in Alberta each year. Finally, this year I can celebrate our utilities. Thanks to the invisible hand of carbon pricing, they are doing the right thing, and the plummeting use of coal in our province is cleaning Alberta's air, and saving lives.\n\nSadly, the current federal pricing plan will eliminate many of these gains, and likely make things even worse. Climate and health will once again be jeopardized by coal combustion, at a time when cheap, emission-free alternatives exist. We need to embrace the future of climate action, not cling desperately to the past.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

He appealed and lost.\n\nHe appealed again. This time he admitted to the crime, but presented evidence that he was suffering from sexsomnia and argued that he was sleeping when he raped the woman.\n\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal granted him a new trial, which began in April 2017.\n\nOn Monday, a Brockville judge will decide if the original conviction should stand or if Hartman is not criminally responsible because of a sleep disorder.\n\nSince being raped in 2011, the 30-year-old woman, whose identity is protected by a court order, has gone through two trials and two appeals. She says the delay has plunged her into depression and anxiety, and she's battled alcohol and drug abuse, endured toxic relationships and wrestled with suicidal thoughts.\n\nShe says she is afraid of breaking down if Hartman is found not criminally responsible.\n\n\"How will I move on? How will I get past it?\" she said. \"If he was found NCR, I don't know how I will continue with my life.\"\n\nHouse party\n\nBefore she was sexually assaulted in 2011, the woman was two months away from graduating from a community justice program at Algonquin College.\n\nOn a February evening during reading week, she and her boyfriend were invited to a house party in Spencerville, Ont.\n\nAfter drinking too much, the couple decided to sleep off the booze before they drove home and crashed on an air mattress. The victim set her cellphone alarm for 6:30 a.m., wrapped her arms around her boyfriend and dozed off.\n\nJust a few minutes before her alarm beeped, she says that she felt a strong pain in her buttocks. Her jeans were pulled down and her belt was loose and someone was penetrating her anally. Her boyfriend remained asleep.\n\nThe victim says she was in shock.\n\n\"The next thing I knew, I woke up in pain and I put my hand behind me to feel where the pain was coming from, and that's when I realized that I was being assaulted.\"\n\nAn Ottawa-area woman who was sexually assaulted in 2011 fears her attacker will be found not criminally responsible for his actions because of a sleep disorder. 1:21\n\nPrior to the attack, she had only had one interaction with Hartman at the party when she had asked him for a cigarette.\n\nShe says Hartman said nothing as he got off the mattress and walked out of the house. As the couple drove away from the home, she saw Hartman sitting at a picnic table in the garage looking \"wide awake.\"\n\n\"He does not have sexsomnia \u2026 and he sexually assaulted me. He is criminally responsible.\"\n\nSexsomnia 'not easily faked'\n\nDeep sleep as a criminal defence has only been used 13 times in Canada in sexual assault cases, said Blair Crew, a University of Ottawa professor who teaches sexual assault law.\n\nCrew said a 2003 Toronto case set the precedent for the sexsomnia defence. In that case, Jan Luedecke was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a party. He was found not criminally responsible.\n\nCrew said that since the Luedecke decision, sexsomnia has resulted in an NCR ruling five times.\n\nAn Ottawa woman fell asleep at a house party and woke up when she was sexually assaulted. Now her attacker is appealing his conviction on the grounds that he did it in his sleep. 6:31\n\nCrew worries sexsomnia cases may embolden potential offenders to think they can assault someone and claim the mental disorder to cast off responsibility. But in reality, he said, proving sexsomnia is difficult, because it requires a lot of medical evidence.\n\n\"Most people who rely on this defence can demonstrate a history of sleepwalking before. Often there is a family history. And the Supreme Court has been very clear that expert testimony will be required,\" Crew said.\n\n\"These are situations that are not easily faked.\"\n\nIf Hartman is found not criminally responsible, he will be treated as a mentally ill patient, and if his mental health improves, he could be discharged completely.\n\nUniversity of Ottawa law professor Blair Crew worries sexsomnia cases may embolden potential offenders to think they can assault someone and claim the mental disorder to cast off responsibility.

She plans to arrive in the courtroom early as she gets anxious when things run late. The stress makes her flash back to her rape.\n\n\"If I had set my alarm an hour earlier or even 15 minutes earlier, the assault may never have happened. So I live my life counting minutes, watching the clock.\"\n\nShe currently works as an office administrator, but before the assault, she hoped to become a parole officer. She once dreamed of rehabilitating offenders, but now she doubts if she can listen to their stories with sympathy.\n\nShe says she's acutely aware that she's not the woman she was meant to be.\n\nHer voice cracks, then steadies as she breathes in and pulls up her sleeve to reveal a tattoo on her wrist: Survivor.\n\n\"I'm not a victim, I'm a survivor.\"\n\nThe woman got this tattoo, which reads 'survivor,' prior to her attacker's second trial.

With more than one million hours of footage in the CBC vaults, the big question for the team was: where do we start?\n\n\"It was a combination of leaning on people that knew ... a lot more than we did and also just going down into the archives and spending hours and hours and hours watching old film reels,\" Dunn said.\n\nNot only did the team immerse themselves in footage but they also called up music experts to pick their brains about the musical performances on Canadian television that have been forever immortalized in their memory.\n\nA 14-year-old Shania Twain, then known as Eilleen Twain, performs on CBC's The Tommy Hunter Show in 1980. (CBC)\n\nOne of those performances \u2014 and a favourite of producers \u2014 was Sammy Davis Jr.'s musical special on CBC's Parade in 1959.\n\n\"It's got some of the most incredible performance footage you'll ever see of any music genre,\" Dunn said.\n\nBut what makes this performance significant, he said, is it was recorded at a time when a black entertainer hosting his own hour of television was unheard of.\n\n\"At that time there was sort of an informal racist policy in the U.S. around how many black artists could appear on American television. A lot of major corporations controlled advertisement and controlled basically what people were going to be watching.\"\n\nIn this video, Paul Anka applauds Sammy Davis Jr.'s 1959 performance on CBC\n\nSammy Davis Jr. hosted his own musical hour in Canada on CBC because of the lack of opportunities for African-Americans on U.S. television networks. 1:35\n\nDespite Davis's celebrity status and the fact he performed alongside Frank Sinatra, advertisers in the U.S. wouldn't co-sign an African-American hosting his own show. The civil rights movement was afoot but there was still a long way to go.\n\nDunn credits two CBC producers who opened doors by sending an invitation to Davis to perform on CBC. Backed by a 30-piece orchestra, Davis's appearance on Parade was the first time the legendary performer would host his very own musical special.\n\n\"Those are the kinds of stories we wanted to tell,\" Dunn said. \"Where it wasn't just, here's an amazing performance, but let's tell a story that says something about the time, that says something about Canada and that says something about the artist.\"\n\nDunn says they chose artists who had a lot to say about the world they were living in.\n\n\"Music was a vehicle for them to get a message out there.\"\n\nWatch pioneering drag performer Craig Russell singing on CBC\n\nCraig Russell, a pioneering drag performer, sings on CBC's late night talk show Canada After Dark in 1978. 0:59\n\nCraig Russell was a Toronto performer who helped bring the underground world of drag into the mainstream during the 1970s.

And that is only a snippet of what is available in the CBC archives.\n\nThe CBC Archives\n\nThe archive libraries at CBC/Radio Canada in Toronto and Montreal hold hundreds of thousands of hours of legacy video and audio, all of which will be transferred to digital formats as part of an ongoing digitization project.\n\n\"I know everybody who works on the team with me is super excited. This is like the crowning glory of their careers to be able to digitize the entire CBC in a very short time,\" said Russ McMillen, who is a co-ordinator for the project.\n\nMcMillen has worked in the archives department at CBC for the past 20 years and has seen first hand the evolution from film recordings to digital files. In the Toronto headquarters, the archive stretches across 10,000 square feet in the basement. One storage vault is equipped with air purifiers and set at 7 C to help preserve the oldest film reels.\n\n\"The colder and drier it is, the longer the film lasts,\" he said.\n\nIt's a delicate process preserving reels of Canadian history, but in these precise storage conditions it will be hundreds of years before they will be unusable. \"Film never stops deteriorating, but we've slowed it down so we have enough time left to transfer them.\"\n\nHere's a look at the CBC archives in Toronto:\n\nArts reporter Tashauna Reid gets a tour inside the CBC archives library at the Toronto Broadcast Centre. 3:08\n\nMcMillen has favourites in the archives, too.\n\n\"We have every single episode of The Beachcombers.

Both agencies are headed by independent officers who report to the legislature, rather than to the government, giving them an independent status similar to the auditor general.\n\nThree sources say the position of child advocate will be scrapped. The child advocate has a mandate to investigate ill-treatment of children in the foster care and Children's Aid Society systems and to review government policy and practice around services to children.\n\nThe child advocate has frequently produced critical reports that triggered changes in provincial policy. The post is held by Irwin Elman, who was appointed in 2008. He has been an outspoken critic of the child welfare system and has called for automatic inquests into every death of a child in care.\n\nOne source indicated the child advocate's duties could be shifted to the provincial ombudsman's office.\n\nOntario Environmental Commissioner Dianne Saxe was appointed to the position in 2015. (Office of the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario)\n\nThree sources also tell CBC News that the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario is facing cuts. Two of those officials said the position of environmental commissioner will be eliminated, while the third government source said that is not entirely accurate.\n\nThe environmental commissioner has a mandate to monitor the government's compliance with provincial environmental laws, including Ontario's Environmental Bill of Rights, and to report annually on the government's progress toward its greenhouse gas reduction targets. The current commissioner is Dianne Saxe, a former environmental lawyer, appointed in 2015.\n\nA spokesperson for Ford's office did not respond Wednesday to a request to confirm or deny the positions will be eliminated.\n\nFord and Fedeli began setting the stage for budget cuts in September, when Fedeli announced that a government-appointed panel pegged this year's deficit at $15 billion, some $8 billion more than Kathleen Wynne's Liberal government forecast in its budget in March. \"The hole is deep and it will require everyone to make sacrifices without exception,\" Fedeli said at the time.\n\nFedeli's economic statement is expected to reveal what some of those sacrifices will be. On Wednesday night, Ford tweeted about one way he will try to make the cuts easier for Ontarians to swallow: extended hours for buying alcohol.\n\nHey Ontario!

At the same time, he pledged frequently during the campaign that no provincial workers would lose their jobs with him as premier. Rather, he promised to find unspecified \"efficiencies\" that would save up to $6 billion annually. His party published a list of spending and tax cut promises during the campaign, but no detailed fiscal plan.\n\nSo far the main efficiencies identified by the Ford government are eliminating landlines in ministerial offices (saving $14,000 annually in Fedeli's office) and going paperless (saving $26,000 at the Treasury Board secretariat.)\n\nAdded together, those savings total about 1/375,000th of the deficit.\n\nFedeli faced sexual misconduct allegation\n\nFedeli is scheduled to deliver the economic statement in the Ontario Legislature shortly after 1 p.m ET.

The allegation has never been tested in court.\n\n'\"These accusations from Patrick Brown are categorically false and without any merit,\" Fedeli said in a statement.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Ford issued a statement declaring Fedeli has his full support.

Her apartment was fully furnished and included utilities and wifi.\n\n\"He was really nice and smiling,\" said Ouellet-Quenneville, who lives on the first floor of her four-unit building on the Plateau Mont-Royal.\n\nShe didn't do a background check on Calder.\n\nNigel Calder rented an apartment in this Plateau Mont-Royal building from Marie-\u00c8ve Ouellet-Quenneville. She allowed him to sign the lease before collecting a first month's rent. (CBC)\n\nNormally, she'd ask for the first month's rent up front before signing the lease and handing over the keys.\n\nBut Calder told her he was heading to the bank and would drop off the money later.\n\n\"I figured it was no big deal. He's going to go and come back,\" said Ouellet-Quenneville.\n\nShe quickly came to regret that decision. He never paid her.\n\n\"He ended up living there three months for free,\" said Ouellet-Quenneville.\n\nRepeat offender\n\nOuellet-Quenneville isn't the only one Calder has done this to.\n\nCBC News discovered the R\u00e9gie du Logement, Quebec's rental board, has ruled against Calder four times in the last three years for failing to pay his rent.\n\nIn each case, the landlord was granted an eviction order, and Calder was ordered to pay what he owed in back rent \u2014 a combined total of $17,000.\n\nMarie-\u00c8ve Ouellet-Quenneville was duped by a tenant who never paid his rent. It took her three months to evict him, and although he was ordered to pay her the money he owed, she never saw a cent. (CBC)\n\nPerhaps to avoid detection, Calder rented apartments in a different neighbourhood each time. Ouellet-Quenneville's apartment is on the Plateau, but the rental board documents show Calder also rented apartments in Rosemont, Griffintown and Pointe\u2013\u200bSaint-Charles.\n\nLandlord Olivier Tremblay said initially, he also thought Calder was a good fit for the apartment Tremblay rented to him in Rosemont in October 2015.\n\n\"He appeared nice, clean and responsible,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Tremblay didn't do any background checks on Calder, either.\n\nCalder paid the first couple months' rent, but for the seven months that followed, Tremblay says he was constantly chasing his tenant for money.\n\nHe had various excuses: the bank was holding his funds, or he was having difficulty accessing his account, said Tremblay.\n\nFed up and forced to dip into his own RRSPs to cover the missing rent money, Tremblay finally went to the rental board in July 2016 to evict Calder.\n\nLandlord Olivier Tremblay said he had to dip into his RRSPs to cover the rent money his former tenant, Nigel Calder, never paid. (CBC)\n\n\"As soon as I got a date to get in front of a judge, it was like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders,\" said Tremblay. \"I would finally see an end to this.\"\n\nA few days before the hearing, Calder gave Tremblay a cheque for the full amount he owed. The cheque still hadn't cleared by the time the case went before the rental board.\n\nThe following week, the cheque bounced, identified by Tremblay's bank as counterfeit. Tremblay followed through with the eviction.\n\nCalder never paid back the money Tremblay was owed.\n\nAnother landlord, who CBC News has agreed not to name, said he, too, never saw a cent of the money Calder owed him in unpaid rent.\n\nHe believes Calder is taking advantage of the system the government put in place to protect tenants.\n\n\"This is not an apologetic tenant who is late on an occasional payment or lost a job and could use a little extra time,\" he said. \"This is an egregious repeat offender.\"\n\nCBC News was unable to reach Calder by phone or email.\n\nBackground checks a must\n\nTo avoid problem tenants, landlords need to do their homework, said Hans Brouillette, public affairs director for CORPIQ, which represents 25,000 Quebec property owners and managers.\n\nProspective tenants should be properly screened, said Brouillette.\n\nThat means checking photo identification, credit and employment history, as well as references from past landlords.\n\nLandlords can also check past rental board decisions.\n\nBrouillette acknowledges some landlords are uncomfortable asking for this type of information, instead relying on a gut feeling or instinct about who they rent to.\n\nFollowing a favourable judgment from the Quebec rental board, only six per cent of property owners are able to get the money they are owed back, said Hans Brouillette, director of public affairs for CORPIQ, a landlords association. (CBC)\n\n\"They need to understand they are in a business, and they must do these checks very carefully,\" Brouillette said.\n\nAlthough there are situations in which a tenant legitimately has problems making a rent payment, Brouillette said there are some tenants who purposely seek out vulnerable, inexperienced landlords to exploit.\n\nIn these cases, he said, the person may give the landlord a fake name and wrong information, knowing they likely won't be checked.\n\n\"Most experienced fraudsters are able to build up stories that would convince the majority of landlords in Quebec,\" said Brouillette.\n\nEviction process not immediate\n\nIt can be hard to get rid of tenants who don't pay their rent.\n\nBy law, landlords have to wait three weeks without being paid before they can apply to the rental board to evict a tenant.\n\nNearly 60 per cent of all the cases before the rental board \u2014 about 27,000 judgments a year \u2014 are linked to unpaid rent.\n\nAccording to documents from Quebec's rental board, Nigel Calder rented an apartment in this Griffintown high-rise in 2017. He was evicted and ordered to pay more than $6,000 he owed in rent. (CBC)\n\nOn average, it can take about a month and a half to get an eviction hearing.\n\nOnce the landlord is granted an eviction notice, tenants have 30 days to appeal the decision, which can drag out the process even longer.\n\n\"We have seen up to one year without paying,\" said Brouillette.\n\nTo make the process fairer, CORPIQ wants the government to reduce the wait time for a hearing.\n\nAlthough tenants are ordered to pay the rent they owe, CORPIQ's statistics show only six per cent of landlords are able to recover their money after a favourable decision.\n\nTo improve the odds and deter non-payment, the association would also like the province to pass legislation allowing landlords to ask for a damage or security deposit.\n\nThat way, if the tenant doesn't pay the rent, the landlord can recover a portion of the money owed, Brouillette said.\n\nNo new legislation\n\nDenis Miron, a spokesperson for the Quebec rental board, said a plan is in place to try and cut the wait for hearings.\n\nCBC News contacted the government to find out if any legislative changes are planned which would allow Quebec landlords to collect a security deposit but did not get an answer.\n\nIn at least two of the Quebec rental board decisions against Calder, seen here, the landlord hired a bailiff to try and find him. Neither ever saw the money he owed them. (Facebook)\n\nThat's unfortunate, said Ouellet-Quenneville, who said she felt powerless as Calder lived rent-free in her apartment building.\n\n\"Each day, I was losing money,\" said Ouellet-Quenneville, who was out $4,100 in rent. \"It was really stressful.\"\n\nCalder never showed up for the rental board hearing. He was ordered to pay what he owed her, but by then, he had disappeared.\n\nShe hired a bailiff to track him down, but realized it was probably hopeless when someone else to whom Calder owed money showed up at her apartment building looking for him a week after his eviction.\n\nThe bailiff never found Calder, and Ouellet-Quenneville never got her money back.\n\n\"It's just sad seeing someone out there profiting off people,\" said Ouellet-Quenneville.\n\nShe hopes she'll never have a tenant like Calder again."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Chris Arsenault", "title": "Canada experimenting with new approach to foreign aid: Giving cash directly to poor people", "description": "Canada has been experimenting with a new method for spending tens of millions of dollars worth of foreign aid: handing cash directly to people in poverty-stricken or war-torn countries, according to two senior officials with Global Affairs Canada.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-aid-cash-transfer-global-affairs-1.4900918", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4900955.1541890049!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/oxfam.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:00:00Z", "content": "Canada is experimenting with a new method for spending millions of dollars in foreign aid: handing cash directly to people in poverty-stricken or war-torn countries, two senior officials with Global Affairs Canada said.

There is no middleman to decide what the needs are. In humanitarian projects, it is being considered the default approach now.\"\n\nEfficiency questions\n\nThe officials said the money is being spent in around three dozen countries, although they could not provide a full breakdown, as direct cash transfers are usually intertwined with other aid programs.\n\nRefugees in Jordan and Ethiopia are some of the people receiving cash aid from Canadians, officials said.\n\nSupporters of giving cash directly to poor people overseas said the transfers help reduce overhead expenses by cutting out high-priced foreign aid consultants, shipping costs and some of the bureaucracy.\n\nA Syrian refugee, right, in Lebanon signs documents after she received a new bank card through which all aid agencies transfer their aid. (Karin Laub/Associated Press)\n\nSupporters of this type of aid said that recipients, especially women, know what they need more than outside experts. And giving people \u2014 particularly refugees \u2014 cash to buy their own food, clothing and other essentials helps stimulate local economies in host countries. It also has the potential to reduce local animus toward the new arrivals.\n\n'Kickstart'\n\nCritics said there isn't enough data on this strategy to properly gauge its long-term effectiveness in reducing poverty and helping poor countries to develop.\n\n\"This type of a thing is good as a kickstart, almost like a jump, but not as a ladder to fundamentally lift people out of poverty,\" said Aniket Bhushan, a Carleton University professor who leads the Canadian International Development Platform, a research group focused on aid policy.\n\n\"The real question is sustainability: What happens after the fact?\"\n\nAs for reduced bureaucracy and overhead, Bhushan said, governments and large aid agencies still need to send their experts to set up, administer and evaluate the programs.\n\nCash transfers don't \"offer enough of a short-circuit to drive up efficiency,\" said Bhushan.\n\nWhat was the most sold food item in WFP-contracted shops across <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jordan?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Jordan</a> this month? <br><br>Vegetables. \ud83c\udf45\ud83e\udd55 Thanks to cash transfers provided by WFP, Syrian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/refugees?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#refugees</a> can choose the food they need & have purchased a total of 130 metric tons of fresh vegetables. <a href=\"https://t.co/F6VIV94fw0\">pic.twitter.com/F6VIV94fw0</a> \u2014@WFP\n\nOthers question whether more Canadian tax dollars should be given away overseas. According to an Angus-Reid poll released in March, 72 per cent of Canadians believe the country is spending either the right amount or too much on foreign aid. Only 28 per cent support an increase.\n\nStill, aid groups said the new tactic has been well received.\n\n\"I haven't come across any political blowback over cash disbursements,\" said Gregory Queyranne, manager of Oxfam Canada's humanitarian unit.\n\n\"If you are dispersing cash, you save on the overhead \u2026 The reality is if you want impact, you need to include cash in your approaches.\"\n\nRefugee investments\n\nNyatlak Nyiet, 30, a South Sudanese refugee living in a camp in western Ethiopia, is one of the people receiving direct cash transfers under a program run by Oxfam and partially financed by the Canadian government.\n\nNyiet ran a tea shop in South Sudan before she was forced to flee last year amid civil conflict.\n\nWhen she arrived in the camp, Nyiet, a widow, gave birth to her sixth child, who was severely malnourished.\n\n\"It was not possible for me to breastfeed. I had only [a] small [amount of] milk, so the baby kept crying,\" she told Oxfam researchers in June, in an interview shared with CBC.\n\nYoung women learn skills, such as food preparation, at Centre D'Apprentissage Feminin in Bamako, Mali, in 2018.

After a major earthquake, for example, there often isn't food or medicine available for purchase amid the rubble.\n\n\"Giving people money to procure health services in the absence of health services doesn't help too much,\" a Global Affairs official said.\n\nThe same is true for conflict zones. In northern Mali, where Canadian troops are working on a UN peacekeeping mission, \"markets often don't exist,\" the official said, so cash transfers wouldn't be effective. There, the government is delivering traditional aid.\n\nResidents reach for sacks of rice during food distribution by the World Food Program after Hurricane Matthew in Jeremie, Haiti, in 2016.

For the few cases where long-term data exists, the impact of the transfers on poverty reduction is \"sanguine,\" he said, citing a study from Uganda that compared two groups over nine years.\n\nMembers of one cohort initially received $400 in unconditional cash transfers, and the others didn't.\n\nAt first, savings and consumption rose markedly for the beneficiaries. But within a decade, the two groups had mostly levelled out in terms of employment income and overall economic well-being.\n\nBack at the refugee camp, Nyiet and other women told researchers that they're thankful for the cold, hard cash, regardless of the broader economic theory behind the program.\n\n\"Now, we cook and eat three times a day,\" Nyiet said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Relatively mild Thursday, but the snow is on its way", "description": "It won't be as windy as yesterday, which will help, and it will turn out to be a bit milder by afternoon.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-weather-november-15-2018-1.4906390", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3464027.1456423508!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ottawa-weather-20160220.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:00:00Z", "content": "Another unseasonably cold morning will start your Thursday.

The province increased monthly support for these youth by up to $250, to a new maximum of $1,250.\n\nCohen says it's a start. \"I'm skeptical but I'm optimistic that the system will look different in a few years and I know that these changes are expensive and time consuming but they are in the child's best interest,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Joel Ballard", "title": "'We want to make sure we have a community that's safe': Dawson Creek mayor responds to violent crimes", "description": "The city of Dawson Creek, in northeastern B.C., has been hit with a string of crimes.

(Travis Golby/CBC)\n\nMcHale, a Winnipeg trainer and goaltending coach for the U of M women's team, said he was just wrapping up a practice with the team Wednesday afternoon when he glanced at his phone and saw a stack of missed calls from Jets assistant general manager Craig Heisinger and a Pennsylvania phone number.\n\nThat was at 5:15 p.m. The puck was set to drop at 7 p.m.\n\n\"I got here as fast as I could, basically \u2014 told everyone I knew and got here as fast as I could,\" McHale said.\n\n\"I was coming from the south end so I had to fight a bit of traffic but I was weaving my way in and out.\"\n\nGavin McHale walks with the Capitals back to the locker room after the team played the Jets Wednesday. (Travis Golby/CBC)\n\nHe didn't get a chance to eat dinner before facing a shot from Ovechkin in the warmup.\n\n\"I was hoping no one saw that \u2014 pretty star-struck,\" said McHale.\n\n\"And then star-struck for the next three or four after that until I kind of settled in and the guys said a couple things to me. So it was good.\"\n\n'It just made me feel really welcomed'\n\nMcHale is one of a few emergency goalies the Jets have recruited to suit up in just such a circumstance \u2014 rare though it is.\n\n\"I think every single person in this room introduced themselves to me,\" McHale said of the Capitals' locker room. \"It just made me feel a lot more calm, and they just kind of let me do my thing.

(Travis Golby/CBC)\n\nWashington Capitals head coach Todd Reirden said it's a unique situation to have to call on emergency backups. The NHL adjusted its rules last summer to require that teams have emergency goalies present for all home games ready to fill in for either team.\n\n\"He was great coming into the room and talking to our guys. I liked having him around,\" Reirden said.\n\n\"There's a lot up in the air and hopefully we weren't going to have to use him \u2014 but at the same time he has to be ready.\"\n\nBlackhawks beat Jets with emergency backup last year\n\nThe Jets also came up against an emergency backup goalie last year, when the Chicago Blackhawks lost goalies Anton Forsberg and Collin Delia to injuries and called 36-year-old accountant Scott Foster.\n\nThe former college goalie stopped all seven shots he faced over the final 14 minutes of the game, and the Blackhawks skated to a 6-2 victory over the Jets.\n\n\"The initial shock happened when I had to dress.

Ads peppered the airwaves, stars from the '88 Games, including Eddie the Eagle, soared into town, there were even last-minute robocalls featuring Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi.\n\nBut it wasn't enough.\n\nCalgarians wanted to focus on local priorities, particularly with an austerity municipal budget scheduled for debate the next day.\n\nSome might have been cranky with stalled pipelines, the NDP government, Nenshi or the federal Liberals.\n\nUnemployment runs high and over 25 per cent of the office space in Calgary's downtown towers sit empty.\n\n\"It looks to me like Calgarians put their head before their hearts on this decision,\" is how Matti Siemiatycki from the Munk School of Business in Toronto put it.\n\nHe studies infrastructure mega-projects and funding models and said those projects often go over budget.\n\n\"I think that's what's so interesting about mega-projects is that there's something about the way that mega-projects come about and the way they're conceptualized and sold to their sponsors, whether in the private sector or the public sector, that endemically leads to underestimated costs and overestimated benefits,\" he said.\n\n\"And we've seen this over and over and over again.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the Olympics, cost overruns are a recurring event. One recent study out of Oxford showed every single Games since 1968 has come in over budget, often costing more than twice as much as expected.\n\nCounter-intuitively, it might have been a lack of promises that helped sink the Calgary vote.\n\nMount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt said it's a distinct possibility.\n\n\"I think you could make a counter argument that one of the problems is there weren't enough legacy items after 2026,\" he said.\n\nA new NHL arena to replace the aging Saddledome he thinks could have sealed the deal.\n\nThe pitch\n\nIf the vision for Calgary's bid could be summed up in one word, it would be: frugal.\n\nIt's not the kind of thing you hang from banners or use to fire up emotions. Calgary's bid had the feel of a cocktail party at the local Value Village that had to be wrapped up by 10 p.m.\n\nBut it would still cost $3 billion in public funds.\n\nThere would be improvements to existing facilities like McMahon Stadium and the Saddledome and a couple of new ones \u2014 a fieldhouse and mid-sized arena \u2014 but sometimes you need a new gown.\n\nThere was hype when it came to the economic benefits of hosting, but the bid corporation, Calgary 2026, couldn't present a clear vision of its accounting.\n\nCity councillors tripped over the numbers and economist Trevor Tombe called some of the claims \"demonstrably\" wrong.\n\nThere were more doubts than facts, more confusion than clarity. A last-minute funding deal provided no comfort \u2014 not even for Coun. Evan Woolley, who chaired the Olympic Assessment Committee and then decided to flee from the sinking ship. The good deal, he said, wasn't there.\n\nThe lack of a vision for what the Games would be and what they would mean for Calgary long-term was a fatal flaw, according to Brent Toderian.\n\nThis rendering shows what Calgary 2026 thought McMahon Stadium could look like for the Olympics. (Calgary 2026)\n\nHe was at the helm of Vancouver's planning department during the 2010 Games and has advised Olympic and would-be Olympic cities on the pros and cons of hosting.\n\nToderian said the reason to host the Olympics and to invest all that money has nothing to do with sports and everything to do with leveraging the money for great city-building initiatives that benefit citizens long-term.\n\n\"What I actually say to cities contemplating bids \u2026 they need to come at that consideration from a position of confidence and clarity around their vision, their aspirations as a city, not from a position of desperation,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the cities that are desperate to make something happen that are at great risk of bankrupting themselves.\"\n\nFrugality might not have been the best vision, and a lack of clarity was endemic, but it's not as though Calgary is without ambitions, dreams and wishlists.\n\nCity building\n\nThere are plenty of lofty words in planning documents and plans that, at least theoretically, guide decisions at city hall. Imagine Calgary, the Centre City Plan, the Complete Streets Guide among them. They are blueprints for a how a bigger, denser, multi-modal city could work.\n\nThey paint a picture of what the city could and should be.\n\nThere are also tangible examples of a place that has moved beyond the concept of four walls and a roof to embrace standout buildings that pump up civic pride. Some are private, some public \u2014 the new Central Library, the National Music Centre, Telus Sky, The Bow, the Peace Bridge.\n\nA view inside Calgary's new central library, which opened almost two weeks before the Olympic plebiscite.

There's the East Village, and the dreams of an entertainment district hugging the Stampede grounds in East Victoria Park.\n\nCoun. Druh Farrell, an outspoken critic of the Games since Day One, repeatedly pointed to other needs, including Calgary's struggling art sector, and wondered why we'd buy into the Olympics.\n\nThe city's chief financial officer warned there was only so much money to go around.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't always problems and debates and the vicious politicking that comes with a city of a certain size. It's just to say there's fodder and a foundation for a different vision of the city.\n\nAnd in an effort to sell the Games, and sell them quickly to a city facing an austerity budget, Calgary 2026 chose to not include any of the long-lasting city infrastructure that could come with the Olympics.\n\nIt didn't build upon existing visions and dreams.\n\nIt chose cheap \u2014 what it would call responsible \u2014 while still racking up a $3 billion public tab.\n\nMembers of the No Calgary Olympics campaign celebrate after the result of the plebiscite was announced in Calgary Tuesday evening.

The city's contribution was leaked on a Saturday. Ottawa's initial offer was revealed the same way.\n\nWhen a final deal was reached, it came through Calgary 2026 in a late night news release the day before council was to vote on killing the bid.\n\n\"For an infrastructure project of this size involving multiple orders of government, why weren't they all on the stage at the same time?\" said Bratt.\n\nThe people saw pain, and risks, with little gain. There was no combination of Calgary's shrewd reputed fiscal management combined with something more. There was no energy.\n\nSo what? Where now?\n\nThe future\n\nIn the wake of Tuesday's vote, some of its biggest supporters were angry. George Brookman, a bonafide civic booster and flag-waving Yes man, called the No side \"losers\" and wondered where their vision for the future was.\n\nIt was a common refrain on social media. A suggestion that if you're opposed to the Olympics, provide another vision for the city or get out of the way.\n\nBut there was also a sense that the debate \u2014 albeit too polarized, too often \u2014 is the start of a bigger discussion about this place and where we're going. It focused minds and set priorities in thousands of disparate brains in all corners of the city.\n\nEven in the course of it, there were ideas about where else to spend and why. The arts, transit, tax relief.\n\nANALYSIS | What a win looks like for Yes and No sides of Calgary 2026 Olympic debate\n\nKate Jacobson is with Better Spent 2026, a group that wanted to talk about exactly that \u2014 where and why we should spend Olympic-size budgets elsewhere.\n\n\"Our take on it was really that it's great when the government spends money, but only when it spends money on public programs and services that actually improve the lives of Calgarians,\" she said.\n\nSnow-clearing, food bank funding, social housing\n\n\"There's things like fully electrified public transit, public snow-clearing services, food bank funding, social housing, expanded cycle-track infrastructure. There are so many projects that are unfulfilled in Calgary that would be such a better use of this money than throwing a mega event in eight years for the International Olympic Committee.\"\n\nJacobson calls budgets \"moral documents\" that reveal what a government really cares about. Look at the numbers, look where the money goes and you find the heart and soul of a place.\n\nAnd with Calgary debating an austerity budget that envisions $100 million in cuts, one day after the plebiscite, she thinks it's a perfect time to have those hard number conversations that show more than just dollars and cents.\n\nA flame is lit atop the Calgary Tower at 8:26 p.m. (20:26), days before a Nov. 13 plebiscite vote ended Calgary's Olympic bid. Now, the city will have to look ahead to other visions for its future.

The right-hander had just 10 victories, the fewest ever by a Cy Young-winning starter.\n\nThe AL prize also reflected a change in voters' values, with Blake Snell of the Tampa Bay Rays narrowly beating out past winners Justin Verlander and Corey Kluber for his first Cy Young. Snell pitched just 180 2/3 innings, fewest ever by a Cy Young-winning starter. Over full seasons, Snell is the second starter to win the award with fewer than 200 innings after Clayton Kershaw logged 198 1/3 in 2014.\n\n\"I definitely think the game has changed in that aspect,\" deGrom said.\n\n\"I feel like it's just turning more into quality of work and what did you accomplish in those innings,\" Snell said. \"I think that's just the way it's going.\"\n\nNo hair, don't care\n\nDeGrom easily beat out Washington's Max Scherzer, who was seeking a third straight Cy Young and fourth overall. DeGrom got 29 first-place votes and 207 points from members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Scherzer had the other first-place vote.\n\nIn his first season after chopping off his distinctive long hair, deGrom cut down hitters from start to finish despite little help from teammates. He had a 1.70 ERA, the lowest in the NL since Zack Greinke's 1.66 mark in 2015. Yet the 30-year-old right-hander went 10-9, eclipsing the low bar among starters of 13 victories set by the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela in 1981 and matched by Seattle's Felix Hernandez in 2010.\n\nJacob deGrom and Blake Snell were just untouchable all season long. <a href=\"https://t.co/MmPRrPqj7i\">pic.twitter.com/MmPRrPqj7i</a> \u2014@MLBONFOX\n\nDeGrom allowed three runs or fewer in 29 consecutive starts to close the season, breaking Leslie \"King\" Cole's 108-year-old record of 26 such outings. Yet the Mets were 11-18 in those games and 14-18 overall with deGrom on the mound.\n\n\"My thought process was, `Hey, take the ball every fifth day and continue to try to put this team in position to win and control what you can control,\"' deGrom said.\n\nHernandez's Cy Young victory signaled a major shift from voters, who once prioritized pitcher wins. The push toward advanced analytics made deGrom's candidacy possible, and by September there was little debate deGrom was worthy, even as the Mets regularly wasted his dominance.\n\n\"This was one of my goals,\" deGrom said. \"The team didn't end up where we wanted to be this past season, but you kind of set personal goals, and I think being able to accomplish something that has been a dream of yours is just something special. To be a Cy Young Award winner, you're in great company, and it truly is an honor.\"\n\nHard luck loser\n\nPerhaps no pitcher had ever been such a hard-luck loser. New York averaged 3.5 runs in games started by deGrom, second only to Cole Hamels for worst support in the majors among qualified pitchers. During one stretch late in the season, the Mets totaled 10 runs over seven of deGrom's outings, and four of those were driven in by the pitcher himself.\n\nDeGrom nearly produced more wins above replacement than actual wins \u2014 an unfortunate sabermetric feat that has only been accomplished once, when the Philadelphia Athletics' Eddie Smith went 4-17 with 4.1 WAR in 1937. Baseball-Reference calculated deGrom for 9.6 WAR.\n\nThe 2014 NL Rookie of the Year, he became the seventh rookie winner voted a Cy Young, joining fellow Mets Tom Seaver and Dwight Gooden. R.A. Dickey was the only other Met to win a Cy Young.\n\nThe Mets unveiled a deGrom bobblehead featuring the Cy Young Award shortly after deGrom was crowned. They will give away 25,000 prior to a home game April 7 against Scherzer's Nationals.\n\nSnell got 17 first-place votes and 169 points to 13 first-place votes and 154 points for Verlander. Kluber had 71 points, followed by Boston's Chris Sale and Houston's Gerrit Cole.\n\nSnell had a 1.89 ERA, third best in the AL since the DH was introduced, trailing only Ron Guidry (1.74) in 1978 and Pedro Martinez (1.74) in 2000. The 25-year-old pitched had 33 1/3 fewer innings than Verlander, but his dominance was enough to sway the electorate.\n\nSnellzilla\n\nThe lefty nicknamed Snellzilla wreaked havoc against the AL's top lineups. He was 3-0 with a 1.08 ERA in four starts against the World Series champion Red Sox, and 2-0 in two starts each against the Astros and Indians. The Yankees roughed Snell up twice, but he got threw five scoreless innings in a victory Aug. 16. That came during a late-season run of nine consecutive wins for Snell, including a victory against every team in the AL East. He also made five starts against former Cy Young winners and went 3-0 with an 0.59 ERA.\n\nSnell was the first player 25-or-younger to win 21 games since Barry Zito in 2002. He was highly regarded as a minor leaguer for his electric arsenal, but subpar control led to struggles during his first two major league seasons. He was even demoted to Triple-A for a month in 2017.\n\nIt all came together this year. Snell was a stalwart for a most unusual pitching staff, taking the ball every fifth day while manager Kevin Cash successfully experimented with reliever \"openers\" to start games in between. Snell led the Rays with 31 starts, and no other traditional starter had more than 17. After longtime franchise ace Chris Archer was traded to the Pirates on July 31, Snell went 9-0 with a 1.17 ERA.\n\n\"I felt with the opener, I had a bigger role on the team,\" Snell said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Sarah Rieger", "title": "Uncertified worker lied about testing Alberta town's drinking water for 7 years", "description": "A former employee of the Town of Oyen in southern Alberta has been fined $1,000 for not monitoring the town's drinking water over a seven-year period.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/oyen-drinking-water-tests-1.4906064", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3434480.1463430108!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/164330967.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:01:37Z", "content": "A former employee of the Town of Oyen in southern Alberta has been fined $1,000 for not monitoring the town's drinking water over a seven-year period.

People send him stories about their loved ones and he selects one for a portrait.\n\nThomas relaxes in his Fort McMurray studio.

She didn't know it was coming,\" he said. Weeks later, he received \"the most touching letter.\"\n\n\"She said she and her sister talk to it when it's hanging up on the wall, and it's like he's there with them again. So it's such an honour to be able to play that role and help people get closer to the loved ones they've lost.\"\n\nThis year, Thomas painted Pte. Beaton Tulk, who served in WW II, but died of a massive heart attack at the age of 44, after he had returned home. He left behind a wife and five children.\n\nThe portrait is now in the mail, headed to Gander, N.L., where Tulk's widow lives.\n\nJustin Trudeau drops by\n\nThomas's introduction as an artist began with a bang when his portrait of Yanick earned a visit from then federal opposition leader Justin Trudeau.\n\nThomas had met Yanick at community events where the elder would pray and was inspired by her kind spirit and generous mentorship.\n\nA few weeks after Thomas painted the mural, Trudeau came to town to canvas with the local Liberal candidate. Thomas playfully invited him to take a #selfiewithelsie in front of the mural \u2014 and Trudeau agreed.\n\nJustin Trudeau, as leader of the opposition in 2014, poses with Thomas, his wife and son, along with local Liberal candidate Kyle Harrietha.

I never tried to re-create something based on what it's actual colour is; it was more about the colour I wanted to give it although, I don't know if I'm as wild as when I first started.\"\n\nRussell has donated works to many, including the families of the four people who died in a 2016 shooting in La Loche, Sask.\n\nHe still corresponds with the mother of the two boys gunned down. She was one of the first people to send him a message when he was evacuating Fort McMurray during the wildfire two years ago.\n\n\"You get those connections with people that are really beautiful,\" he said."}]
