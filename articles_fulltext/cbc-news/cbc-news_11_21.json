(Jane Adey/CBC)\n\nThe Department of Fisheries and Oceans is meeting with crab harvesters across the province this week to discuss a precautionary approach for the troubled snow crab stock.\n\nRecent science shows the abundance of snow crab is at its lowest level in 25 years, and new biological information shows crabs aren't growing to a fishable size.\n\nThe precautionary approach is a management strategy that differentiates stock status into healthy, cautious and critical levels. DFO scientists haven't completed their assessment of the 2018 crab season but examples used by DFO show that if the approach had been applied to the 2017 season, it would have meant an 80-per-cent cut to the largest group of crab fishers in the province in an area known as 3L.\n\n\"I understand the concerns of fishermen but we are trying to have a sustainable fishery so that fishermen can have a fishery in future years,\" said Annette Rumbolt, regional manager for resource management for DFO.\n\nHarvester concerns about DFO science\n\nSome 200 harvesters and their representatives attended the DFO meeting in St. John's Monday.

They're calling for more and better science and improved communication with fishers.\n\n\"This can't be just based on what one group sees based on crab in their survey. There's other factors at play,\" said Doyle\n\n\"We are the best science that are out there ... we've seen things in the past that maybe they haven't seen, or if they have they're not communicating with us that they have. So yes, we need more science,\" he said\n\nDFO said it will establish a working group on the precautionary approach for snow crab management.\n\nThe snow crab stock assessment for the 2019 season will be held in March.\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Scott Dippel", "title": "Calgarians give their city high marks in latest citizen satisfaction survey", "description": "City's annual citizen satisfaction survey finds Calgarians still give their city high marks.

Former public works minister Judy Foote said it would be a faster, cheaper solution.\n\nUnlike its two competitors, the Type 26 has yet to enter service with the Royal Navy and competitors have privately knocked it as \"paper ship.\"\n\nNavantia, a Spanish-based company, was the other failed bidder.

That move was met with a chorus of criticism from the Conservatives, New Democrats, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Greens, who demanded that votes also be called to fill the vacancies in the ridings of Outremont, York\u2013Simcoe and Burnaby South.\n\nAs first reported by The Hill Times and confirmed to CBC News by a Liberal source, the Liberals intend to call the byelections early in the new year, with the date to be set for some point in February.\n\nSingh announced he would be the NDP's candidate in Burnaby South in early August, before former NDP MP Kennedy Stewart had officially vacated the seat. Stewart announced earlier in the year that he would be resigning to mount what would turn out to be a successful bid for the mayor's office in Vancouver. The seat has only been officially vacant since mid-September.\n\nThe NDP leader is likely to have a tough fight on his hands. While the Greens have decided they will extend the \"leader's courtesy\" to Singh by not putting up a candidate against him, both the Liberals and Conservatives will contest the seat.\n\nA recent poll by Mainstreet Research suggested the New Democrats were running third in the riding, though the poll showed a considerable number of undecideds and had a relatively high margin of error.\n\nThe Montreal riding of Outremont, vacated by former NDP leader Tom Mulcair over the summer, is also expected to be difficult for the New Democrats to hold: the Liberals are riding high in the polls in Quebec and the NDP has suffered a significant drop in support there.\n\nThe Liberals have yet to nominate a candidate in Outremont. The New Democrats have nominated Julia Sanchez to try to retain the seat for the party.\n\nThe Conservatives have nominated businessman Scot Davidson to hold the Ontario riding of York\u2013Simcoe for the party, after the resignation of former Conservative cabinet minister Peter Van Loan in September. The riding is not expected to change colours.\n\nThe only opposition party leader that did not criticize the Liberal decision to hold off on calling the three byelections until next year was Maxime Bernier of the People's Party of Canada. As a newly-formed party, the PPC was not eligible to run candidates in any byelection called within 60 days of his application for registration with Elections Canada in October.\n\nOnce the byelections are called and the PPC nominates candidates \u2014 as Bernier has said he will do in all three ridings \u2014 his party will fulfill the final step to become an officially registered party, allowing the PPC to award tax receipts to its donors.\n\nBy law, the Liberals have until Jan. 30 to call the byelection in Outremont.

The new formula raised the income threshold.\n\nThe poverty line for one parent with one child is $28,884. In 2017, the poverty line for one parent with one child was $25,498.\n\nThe child poverty rate was 24.7 per cent in 2015.\n\nRandy Hatfield, executive director of the Saint John Human Development Council, said many of the young people living in poverty are children of single-parents or newcomers to New Brunswick.\n\nAbout 1,200 of the 7,600 Muslim children and teenagers in New Brunswick, from infants to 17-years-olds, are living in poverty, he said.\n\n\"Many of these children are coming with families in refugee situations, and if you're coming as a refugee to New Brunswick, you're entitled to a level of support that those on welfare would receive, so it's not surprising really,\" Hatfield told Information Morning Saint John.\n\nRandy Hatfield, executive director of the Human Development Council in Saint John, said political will is needed to improve the lives of people who are living in poverty.

It goes to participation, belonging, social cohesion, but the only thing we can measure really is income, it's very crude and a proxy measure, but it's one that you can look at over time.\"\n\nPoverty has 'deleterious effects'\n\nThe report also says that one in three people accessing a food bank in New Brunswick is a child.\n\n\"There's a lot of trauma that's associated with poverty and youth poverty and that's why we want to catch them when they're young,\" Hatfield said.\n\n\"Over the life cycle, poverty has a lot of deleterious effects.\"\n\nAccording to 2016 numbers, the most recent data, New Brunswick has the fourth highest child poverty rate of Canada's 10 provinces.

More money would allow for more preparation in advance of competition and more support on the ground at the Games.\n\nBut just meeting the shortfall is Job 1.\n\nIf things don't change, a third of the 2022 athletes will have to pay to play. And the Canadian governing body would exhaust its reserve fund, meaning that every athlete and coach would have to pay to take part in the 2026 Games.\n\n\"If that happens, you can bet that there'll be less athletes and coaches on the team,\" MacPherson said.\n\nAnd likely fewer medals.\n\nCanada won 82 medals at the Gold Coast Games, earning 15 gold, 40 silver and 27 bronze.

The government is allocating $25 million over the next five years to \"enhance federal capacity to address situations where Canadian agricultural producers may be prevented from selling goods in international markets.\"\n\nThe Liberal government's trade agenda touts the economic growth potential of opening up new markets for Canadian goods and services. While Canada has negotiated preferential trade deals with every G7 country, its exports of non-energy goods \u2014 which represent about two-thirds of total export volumes \u2014 have remained largely unchanged over the last decade.\n\nThe economic statement notes that 99 per cent of Canada's oil is exported to the U.S., creating a \"near-total reliance\" on the U.S. market. Canada will face pipeline transportation constraints until the TransMountain pipeline extension, now owned by the federal government, is built.\n\nA recent analysis of import and export data for the first months following the implementation of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union found that Canadian exports weren't significantly up, or weren't growing as fast as EU exports to Canada, under the terms of the new deal.\n\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau's fall economic statement accelerates funding for marine port, rail and highway infrastructure to make it easier for non-energy goods to reach markets beyond the United States. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\n\nCanada's share of goods exported to emerging economies (developing countries) is also lower than the share claimed by the countries it wants to compete with internationally. The Department of Finance attributes this to a reliance on the U.S. market \u2014 but given the protectionist measures implemented by Donald Trump's administration, too much focus on American customers is risky.\n\nMorneau's statement Wednesday announced that, out of the $597 million collected so far through Canada's recent retaliatory tariffs (introduced in response to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs), $250 million will be put into an existing strategic innovation fund to pay for new investments in the sector.\n\nNew transportation infrastructure funding\n\nWhile relying on the American market has drawbacks, taking advantage of new market opportunities presented by American trade policy decisions can be equally difficult. Take soybeans, for example: retaliatory tariffs put in place by the world's biggest soybean buyer, China, have all but shut U.S. farmers out of a key market as other countries have moved in. But Canadian soybean exporters were prevented by limited rail transport and port capacity from moving significantly more of their crop to Asia.\n\nMorneau's fall economic statement takes nearly $774 million from infrastructure spending announced in the 2016 budget \u2014 intended to be spent over ten years \u2014 and moves it up to fund investments in marine ports, rail infrastructure and highways over the next five years.\n\nAn additional $13.6 million over the next three years will be spent to improve rail passenger and freight data, to help Canadian supply chains operate more predictably and efficiently.\n\nThe Canadian Trade Commissioner Service will get $184 million over the next five years, boosting its ability to provide advice and services in areas like digital technology, e-commerce and intellectual property.\n\nIts Can Export program, which helps Canadian businesses find new markets, will be tripled in size. Its technology accelerator program, which has helped Canadian firms raise capital in Boston, Philadelphia, New York City and Silicon Valley, will receive an additional $17 million to expand to Delhi, Hong Kong and Tokyo.\n\nOther measures in the update meant to help Canadian exporters include:\n\nAn expansion of a program to help small and medium-sized businesses in the steel, aluminum and manufacturing sectors explore new export markets created by recent trade deals with the EU and Pacific Rim trading partners. A $50 million investment was announced last June, and this economic statement provides $100 million more over six years.\n\n$13.5 million for a 'mentors' program for \"high-potential exporting firms.\"\n\n$10 million for partnerships with other levels of governments and business organizations to help small- and medium-sized businesses compete internationally.\n\nNo clear amounts for dairy compensation\n\nAnyone hoping to find specifics about compensation for Canada's supply-managed agriculture sectors in Wednesday's statement came away disappointed.\n\nThe Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership will take effect on Dec.30, opening up new slices of Canada's protected dairy, egg and poultry markets to foreign competition. This market access was a concession Canadian negotiators deemed necessary in order for Canada to receive other benefits from the new deal.\n\nAt the time the original Trans-Pacific Partnership was negotiated, the former Conservative government proposed a large compensation package for these industries, worth up to several billion dollars. The Trudeau government has not yet committed to any specific measures, but has formed two working groups to discuss the future of these industries generally, and compensation specifically.\n\nA table included in Wednesday's documents includes a line for \"non-announced measures\" \u2014 which could include whatever the federal cabinet eventually settles on as a compensation package \u2014 but it's not known what percentage of these figures could be spent on compensation.\n\nScant progress on interprovincial trade barriers\n\nMorneau's statement also re-tells an old story about how the Canadian economy would be more competitive if internal trade barriers were reduced between jurisdictions in Canada.\n\nPremiers like Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil and Ontario Premier Doug Ford last met as a group in July. They'll meet Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Dec. 7 for talks focused on economic and trade issues. (Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press) Canada has had an internal trade agreement in place since July 1, 2017. Public procurement was opened up across provinces, and discriminatory treatment of businesses from other jurisdictions is now not allowed. A new dispute resolution process is also being implemented.\n\nBut it's not clear how many regulatory barriers have been addressed in the months since.\n\nIt's an issue Canada's premiers have been wrestling with for years. The next meeting of Canada's First Ministers, scheduled for Dec. 7, will revisit the subject again.\n\nWednesday's statement includes a list of 23 items in a \"work plan,\" prioritized in four categories: goods transportation (including trucking), food inspection, construction services and alcohol liberalization.\n\nWhile the federal government participates in the federal-provincial committee on internal trade, most of these action items fall under provincial jurisdiction. The federal government has addressed just two of them: by eliminating restrictions on organic labelling for aquaculture products and by repealing inspection requirements for some agricultural products.\n\nWednesday's statement announced some new funding for the National Research Council to make access to national building codes free \u2014 to help small businesses and to provide a boost to the construction sector. Ottawa is working with provinces and territories to encourage them to adopt the national codes, so the industry isn't dealing with different rules across Canadian provinces."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "U.S. Supreme Court chief justice calls out Trump for his 'Obama judge' remark", "description": "U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is pushing back against President Donald Trump for his description of a judge who ruled against Trump's migrant asylum policy as an \"Obama judge.\"", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-roberts-judge-asylum-1.4915095", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915134.1542831804!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/96277812.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:18:09Z", "content": "U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is pushing back against President Donald Trump for his description of a judge who ruled against Trump's migrant asylum policy as an \"Obama judge.\" It's the first time the Republican-appointed leader of the federal\u2026 [+3729 chars]", "fulltext": "U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is pushing back against President Donald Trump for his description of a judge who ruled against Trump's migrant asylum policy as an \"Obama judge.\"\n\nIt's the first time the Republican-appointed leader of the federal judiciary has offered even a hint of criticism of Trump, who has previously blasted federal judges who ruled against him.\n\nRoberts said Wednesday the U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.\" He commented in a statement released by the Supreme Court after a query by The Associated Press.\n\nOn the day before American Thanksgiving, Roberts said that an \"independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nTrump hit back on Twitter.\n\nSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u201cObama judges,\u201d and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country.

During the presidential campaign, Trump criticized Roberts himself for the chief justice's decisive vote in 2012 to preserve the Obama health care overhaul.\n\nTrump also referred to a judge who was presiding over a fraud lawsuit against Trump University as a Mexican who would be unable to rule fairly because of Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nIn the wake of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, several justices have spoken out about judicial independence and the danger of having the court viewed as a political institution that is divided between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nThe president's latest remarks come as the Supreme Court is enmeshed in controversy over his appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Several justices have spoken out about judicial independence and the danger of having the court viewed as a political institution that is divided between five conservative Republicans and four liberal Democrats. Roberts is widely seen as the justice closest to the middle and likely to determine the outcome of high-profile cases that split the court.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump criticized the California judge while speaking to reporters Tuesday. (Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nTrump made the latest comments Tuesday after a reporter asked for his reaction to a ruling by U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco that put the administration's asylum policy on hold.\n\nThe president complained that his opponents file lawsuits in courts that are part of the liberal-leaning 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Before he took office, conservative groups tended to bring challenges to Obama-era policies in Texas, part of the conservative-leaning 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n'Not going to happen like this anymore'\n\n\"Every case that gets filed in the 9th Circuit, we get beaten. And then we end up having to go to the Supreme Court, like the travel ban, and we won,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president went on to say about the asylum ruling: \"This was an Obama judge. And I'll tell you what, it's not going to happen like this anymore. \"\n\nBut the initial travel ban ruling in 2017 was issued by U.S. District Judge James Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush. Roberts also was appointed by Bush.\n\nIt was unclear what Trump meant when he said things would change. The 9th Circuit is by far the largest of the federal appellate courts, covering Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Some Republicans in 9th Circuit states have proposed splitting the circuit in two, but legislation has not advanced.\n\nThe court has long had a majority of judges appointed by Democratic presidents, with the current breakdown at 16-7. But Trump has the opportunity to narrow that edge significantly because there are six vacancies, and he already has nominated candidates for five of them."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Lack of Romaine lettuce recall leaves grocers in a lurch", "description": "Grocery chains across Canada moved quickly to take possibly E. coli contaminated Romaine lettuce off their shelves on Wednesday, but the lack of a formal recall notice for the product has made things more difficult for them by muddying the waters of who will \u2026", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/romaine-lettuce-grocery-wednesday-1.4914877", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915105.1542831386!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/romaine-lettuce-farm.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:16:13Z", "content": "Grocery chains across Canada moved quickly to take Romaine lettuce that could be contaminated with E. coli off their shelves on Wednesday.

But the lack of a formal recall notice for the product has made things more difficult by muddying the waters of who will pay for all that wasted food.\n\nHealth authorities in the U.S. and Canada issued expanded warnings this week about romaine lettuce that has so far been blamed for sickening 18 people in Ontario and Quebec, one in New Brunswick and 32 Americans across 11 states.\n\nA particularly virulent strain \u2014 E. coli O157 \u2014 is the suspected culprit, and officials believe the source of the outbreak may be a single source of the vegetable that has yet to be isolated, coming in contact with infected animal feces at some point during the farming process.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada issued a public notice on Tuesday advising Canadians to avoid the vegetable until further notice, and the U.S. Centres for Disease Control is giving similar advice.\n\nBoth warnings fall short of a formal recall mandating the removal of the product, but some of Canada's largest grocery chains have pulled it from their shelves anyway.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution,\" grocery giant Loblaw told CBC News in a statement Wednesday, \"Loblaw Companies Limited is recalling and removing from store shelves across the country all romaine lettuce products.\"\n\nIn addition to pulling the product from its shelves so new customers can't buy it, on Wednesday the grocery chain started contacting customers of its loyalty program, PC Optimum, instructing them that they can return the product to any store for a full refund. Loblaw knows those customers bought the lettuce because their purchases are tracked every time they collect points.\n\nMontreal-based chain Metro Inc. echoed that sentiment, noting that all the chain's Canadian stores \"have preventatively and temporarily removed from our shelves all romaine lettuce.\"\n\nRomaine lettuce is included in more than 300 different products sold by Nova Scotia-based Sobey's Inc., and it too has acted swiftly to get all of them off the shelves across the country.\n\n\"It's complex, but it shouldn't stop you from doing the right thing,\" said Lyne Castonguay, the chains' executive vice-president of customer experience in an interview.\n\nBut that poses a logistical problem for retailers. Unlike safety issues with consumer goods like automobiles and other products, the complicated series of rules about who covers the cost of disposal and replacement doesn't come into effect until a recall notice has been issued.\n\nSince that doesn't exist in this case, grocery chains must bear that cost until the supplier responsible for the problem can be identified.\n\nWhile Sobey's declined to offer specifics on what removing the lettuce has cost so far, in the meantime \"it is on us and it's millions of dollars,\" Castonguay said. \"There's no amount of money that's worth having somebody sick or having a fatality.\"\n\nA similar outbreak last year sickened people and it, too, wasn't met with an immediate recall. (Mark J. Terrill/Associated Press)\n\nJason McLinton, the vice-president of the grocery division and regulatory affairs with the Retail Council of Canada, said his organization has noticed a marked increase of these situations in recent years, where a food item may be unsafe, but no formal recall order has been issued by authorities.\n\n\"We are seeing more and more of these 'do not consume' advisories being issued and it's new to consumers and people don't know quite know what to make of it,\" he said in an interview.\n\n\"That puts members in a very challenging situation [and] it's causing quite a bit of confusion in the marketplace.\"\n\nWith millions of products on their shelves, grocery chains rely on agreements with thousands of suppliers for what to do when they are found to be defective. \"This territory is not well known as compared with something like a recall,\" McLinton says, \"where things like that tend to be built in directly into the contractual arrangements that retailers get into with their vendors and producers.\"\n\nThe industry found itself in the same situation last year, when a similar strain of E. coli linked to infected lettuce sickened dozens across the continent. Then, too, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency warned Canadians not to consume the product, but fell short of issuing a formal recall notice.\n\n\"It's the same playbook [as last year],\" Prof. Keith Warriner, a microbiologist specializing in food safety at the University of Guelph told CBC News this week. \"They seem to be saying, 'We're not going to recall it, but we advise you not to eat it.' which I think is a bad thing because it gives confusion.\"\n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency told CBC News in a statement Wednesday why the bar for an official recall has yet to be hit. \"If a specific brand and/or source of romaine lettuce or other product is identified in the investigation, CFIA will take appropriate action,\" the agency said. \"If a food recall warning is issued, CFIA would verify that the food industry and retailers remove the recalled products from the marketplace.\"\n\nNeither the Canadian or American food safety investigation have been able to identify a specific product of concern in the Canadian or American market place. All products tested as part of the investigation have been negative so far.\"\n\nFor its part, the federal government would say only that is is monitoring the situation to get more information.\n\n\"It's certainly a complex situation,\" Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said. \"I encourage all Canadians to follow the warnings that are put out there.\n\n\"I have confidence in the staff [that] they're doing the investigations and will do all they can to get to the bottom of this.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Highlights of Bill Morneau's 2018 fiscal update", "description": "Finance Minister Bill Morneau delivered his fall economic statement Wednesday.

But if they want the candy, they're going to have to increase productivity by spending money on new equipment here in Canada.\" So I'd say that's the narrative. Yes, you can condemn us on Bay Street for going into deficit, but try to condemn us while you're taking the cash.\n\nVK: It is important to realize that during the campaign the Liberals were not peddling the same narrative. They were saying that deficits should be modest, and what we mean by modest is a maximum of $10 billion. That narrative is now gone, so the Conservatives are not surprisingly jumping on it.\n\nCH: Will Canadian voters jump on it too?\n\nVK: I don't know if that's something that people are going to care about in the election. I think the idea of debt, adding to the debt and the interest we pay on it, is something that resonates, but I don't know if the messaging has gone through the way the Conservatives hope. I'm not sure it's a slam dunk for either side.\n\nRR: I think Vassy's right, because Canadians themselves have taken on more debt than ever before. We are more indebted than ever before. So are Canadians more comfortable with debt now than they were, say, 25 years ago? I think they are. But those of us who were around in the 80s remember how one-third of every dollar the government spent went to servicing the debt.\n\nWe are nowhere near that rate now, but some Canadians do remember how difficult it was to get service out of the government because of high interest rates. They do remember how difficult it was to get a mortgage. People of a certain era are scarred by that, and scared by that.\n\nCH: Did Finance Minister Bill Morneau have any choice but to respond to Trump's steep corporate tax rate cuts and 100 per cent write-offs?\n\nRR: He probably didn't have a choice in terms of the corporate side. He certainly couldn't match the Trump tax cuts. Did the Liberals have a choice, though, on the rate in increase on social spending? They certainly did. Because that's running far and above the rate of inflation.\n\nI do think it's very clever politics, though, to say, \"Yes we're going into deficits longer and deeper than we thought and I blame Donald Trump.\" It's going to be hard for people to say, \"You should have done what Trump did.\" That's a tough line of attack for anyone trying to go after the Liberals.\n\nCH: Is Morneau showing with this fiscal update that the Liberals are not afraid to continue to spend over this next year, ahead of the 2019 election?\n\nVK: I think they signalled that yesterday very clearly. I think it was to move them out of the way so you can present a budget later next year that is full of goodies for all the others. Now you've dealt with this big elephant in the room, the cries from the business community, and you're moving it out of the way so you can focus your budget on pharmarcare, social spending. There's no indication from Bill Morneau that there are any plans to tighten anything up in the foreseeable future.\n\nCH: Where does this leave the NDP?\n\nRR: There's no oxygen for them. [The Liberals] are consciously, deliberately eating their lunch and it shows in the polls. There's not a lot of room for the NDP and there really won't be for them or the Conservatives on this, unless there's a downturn.\n\nI've learned that the way things look a year out from an election look very, very different than how they look on election day. The Liberals have to hope there isn't a downturn in the economy. A downturn for the Liberals would be bad news for them and, of course, good news for the Opposition.\n\nInterview has been edited and condensed.

But acco\u2026 [+4730 chars]", "fulltext": "The Public Health Agency of Canada is once again telling Canadians not to eat romaine lettuce, specifically in Ontario, Quebec and now New Brunswick, while health officials in the U.S. and Canada try to confirm the source of a new E. coli O157 outbreak.\n\nBut according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the caesar salad staple is suspected, and not for the first time.\n\nThis is the third outbreak in North America suspected to be linked to romaine in the past year. According to the Microbiology Society, 20 to 30 per cent of outbreaks of E. coli poisoning are caused by people eating contaminated vegetables. Lettuce and other leafy greens are often the culprits. Here's why:\n\nHow it's grown\n\nLettuce needs a lot of irrigation water during cultivation. And sometimes the root of the problem is as simple as cross-contamination on the farm where it's being grown.\n\n\"You can get contamination from animal production facilities, it gets into the sediment, it gets into the water, which gets irrigated onto the crops, which are then harvested within 40 to 80 days,\" says Keith Warriner, a microbiologist specializing in food safety at the University of Guelph.\n\nThe way lettuce is grown contributes to its susceptibility to contamination. (Ted S. Warren/Associated Press)\n\nThe bacteria can also come from birds flying overhead or other wild animals walking through fields. And, short of moving all production into greenhouses, it's just very difficult to avoid that kind of contamination. It's equally hard to pinpoint the source.\n\n\"By the time public health officials are notified, people have been sickened for a long time,\" said Lawrence Goodridge, professor of food safety at McGill University.\" And he said, since the shelf life of lettuce is quite short \u2014 about five weeks \u2014 it may not even be in circulation any longer.\n\nRaw versus cooked\n\nBut it's not just lettuce and leafy greens. There is currently a salmonella outbreak in western Canada linked to cucumbers. What do these all have in common? Consider this: when was the last time you cooked your lettuce or cucumbers?\n\nThat's another basic reason why people more often get sick from eating contaminated lettuce and other salad greens. Unlike many other vegetables, they are rarely cooked before being consumed. Cooking kills E. coli O157 and other bacteria. So other vegetables may be getting contaminated just as lettuce is, but because the vegetables are mostly being cooked, there is no widespread outbreak of illness.\n\nWhat about washing?\n\nWashing the produce at home is not a reliable way to remove bacteria.\n\n\"The bacteria can be stuck on the surface of the lettuce, it can even get inside the lettuce,\" Goodridge says. \"So if you wash it, you might remove some of the bacteria, but you're not removing 100 per cent. And we know in some cases, when we look at historical outbreaks of E. coli, even ingesting one single bacterial cell was enough to cause illness.\"\n\nWhat about pre-washed packaged lettuce?\n\nIf you tend to reach for the convenience of pre-washed, pre-cut greens, you've probably seen on the packaging that it says they've been double- or even triple-washed. But Goodridge says, again, when it comes to E. coli, that means nothing.\n\n\"It's washed to remove dirt, and chlorinated water is used, but really, that doesn't do much. In fact, studies have shown it tends to spread the contamination around.\" And what's worse, he suggests, when the lettuce is cut in the processing plant, the leaf releases sugars that the bacteria like to grow on. So the bacteria can multiply even faster.\n\nConsider, too, he says, that to get to that bag or box, the lettuce has gone through a lot of hands and a lot of machinery, all of which could be harbouring bacteria, too.\n\nA microscopic image shows colonies of E. coli bacteria grown on an agar plate. (U.S. Centers for Disease Control via Reuters)\n\nWhy is lettuce contamination so hard to prevent?\n\nIt's a question being asked by many scientists.\n\n\"Those of us who work in this area, we have much work to do to try to figure out why this apparently seems to keep happening,\" Goodridge says. \"Is there something specific about romaine lettuce that perhaps now suddenly in the past year has elevated it, or is it just a coincidence?\"\n\nAt the University of Guelph, there may be the beginnings of some answers to that.\n\n'We've actually got some current research going on here that suggests, of all the different lettuce types, E. coli O157 likes romaine lettuce,\" Warriner says, \"especially if it is breaking out of its dormant state. So there is an association with leafy greens and E. coli O157. People suggest it's a pathogen-vegetable interaction going on, where they're actually adapted to living on lettuce.\"\n\nMinus any conclusive findings, though, both scientists agree it's not worth the risk to eat romaine lettuce right now. If you have it, they say, throw it out. And don't buy any or order it in a restaurant for the time being.\n\nThe National's health panel talked about the latest lettuce contamination this week:"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Canadian Press", "title": "Ontario considers alternative options for high-speed rail", "description": "Ontario is considering alternatives to a planned multibillion-dollar high-speed rail corridor between Toronto and Windsor, with the government saying it wants to ensure the region gets served by a mode of transportation best suited to its needs.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/high-speed-rail-1.4915058", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3440731.1495160732!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/file-photo-of-tgv-train.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:16:38Z", "content": "Ontario is considering alternatives to a planned multibillion-dollar high-speed rail corridor between Toronto and Windsor, with the government saying it wants to ensure the region gets served by a mode of transportation best suited to its needs.

They committed $11 billion to high-speed rail in their final budget, delivered in March, but gave no final pricetag for the project.\n\nConcerns over farm land slowed project plans\n\nThe Liberals promised that trains would travel up to 250 kilometres per hour, cutting travel times between Toronto and Windsor from four hours to two. Former premier Kathleen Wynne said the project would serve as an economic driver along a corridor home to more than seven million people and over 60 per cent of Ontario's economic activity.\n\nBut critics of the plan expressed concern about the large swaths of prime farm land the project could eat up.\n\nThe Ontario Federation of Agriculture said the line would have to be built on expropriated farmland, creating a permanent division across the province and disrupting wildlife corridors and natural drainage patterns.\n\nYurek said the previous government ignored the concerns of farmers, and said the Tories would consult with members of the agricultural sector.\n\nAn advisory board on the project, headed by former federal transportation minister David Collenette, has been disbanded, Yurek added.\n\n\"Mr. Collenette and his board were only looking at the high speed rail option,\" he said. \"We want to make sure we cover all the bases.\"\n\nCollenette, who was the government's special adviser on high-speed rail, had concluded in a report released last year that there was a business case for the project. He wrote that it would alleviate pressure on the heavily-travelled Highway 401, free up air travel capacity by lessening the need for short-haul flights and spur regional development.\n\n'It's going backwards' Windsor MPP\n\nThe Tory government's move to look at alternatives to high-speed rail for the project has raised concerns in some quarters.\n\nNDP legislator Lisa Gretzky, who represents a riding in Windsor, said her community will be disappointed at a delay in moving ahead with the project.\n\n\"On the surface they say they're supportive of high-speed rail but now they're possibly looking at ways get out of their commitment,\" she said of the government. \"It's definitely going backwards.\"\n\nLiberal legislator Marie-France Lalonde said the high-speed rail corridor has the potential to be a \"game changer\" for the region.\n\n\"We have not yet heard if this project will go forward. We only know the team assigned to this project has been dismantled, and we have no timeline for their review,\" she said. \"We hope that this government takes a long-term approach, instead of relying on short-sighted cuts.\"\n\nThe mayor of Sarnia, Ont., which would stand to benefit from project, said indications that the Tory government might be backing away from high-speed rail were disappointing but he noted that his community needed more short-term transportation options as well.\n\n\"Sarnia has one train in and out a day,\" said Mike Bradley. \"High speed rail is a nice lofty dream and I'm a supporter of high speed rail. I'm just trying to be realistic about what can happen now. I did not sense before, during or after the election that the new government was committed to it.\"\n\nGreen party Leader Mike Schreiner said the Tory government needs to prioritize the foundational elements of transit, like better bus service throughout the province, while continuing work on high-speed rail.\n\n\"My fear with the Liberal government was that they were using high speed rail to distract from the fact that they actually weren't delivering on the solutions that are short and medium-term,\" he said. \"My fear with the new government is they're not going to do any of those \u2014 the short, medium or long-term solutions.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Amherst police arrest 2 men in dump truck heist", "description": "The men face charges of possession of a stolen vehicle after a dump truck, reported stolen in New Brunswick, wound up in Amherst, N.S.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/amherst-police-stolen-dump-truck-1.4914992", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144452.1542830204!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/amherst-police.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:09:04Z", "content": "Amherst police arrested two men in a coffee shop parking lot in the town Wednesday after a stolen dump truck showed up in the area.

It is sweet and funny and poignant on so many levels.\n\nSeverance, by Ling Ma\n\nThis book is a fascinating exploration of the millennial condition.\n\nA young woman continues working at her meaningless job despite the fact that the entire population is dying of a flu pandemic. Her job has literally no purpose anymore, but she continues to do paperwork, believing her immigrant parents' conviction that work in itself has meaning.\n\nThe flu has the odd effects of trapping people in a paralytic state of nostalgia, which also reflects the existential state of millennials who negotiate the reality of living in a post-internet world and replicate reality into nostalgic moments as they happen.\n\nFever Dream, by Samanta Schweblin\n\nThis is one of the most brilliant books I have read in years.

It begs such questions as: What is it that we see in the eyes of animals, and how are we able to deal with their innocence in the face of our own corrupt self-awareness? Why are writers so sensitive and hateful all at once? What does it mean to be a stray human being? And it is also, in the end, a beautiful story about a woman who puts everything aside to make sure a dog is safe and happy.\n\nSplit Tooth, by Tanya Tagaq\n\nTanya Tagaq is a famous Inuit throat singer. This is her first novel, and it does not disappoint.\n\nSplit Tooth paints a brutally honest portrait of what it is like to grow up in Nunavut, where the sun stays up for days on end before the moon takes its place.\n\nTagaq's book almost feels like it should be read out loud so that every word can be properly appreciated.\n\nThe raw realism of the storytelling slowly starts to morph into surreal Inuit folk tales. The main character, who at first feels a disconnect from her ancestry, has a love affair with the Northern Lights and is impregnated with twins.\n\nThe boy twin holds death and darkness within him, while his sister contains life and joy, and together they are one. The narrative is interlaced with prose, poems, and illustrations.\n\nI am so happy that Tagaq took us on this ride with her. What a work of art.\n\nThe Emissary, by Yoko Tawada\n\nAn absolutely marvellous and mysterious book by the author of Memoirs of a Polar Bear. I have loved Japanese writer's Yoko Tawada's previous writings, but this one knocks it out of the park with its sheer sublime investigation of caring and time and what it means to be present in the world.\n\nThe Emissary takes place in a dystopic Japan that is cordoned off from the rest of the world. The elderly have been bestowed with a strange gift of immortality and grow feisty and more active the older they become, whereas the new generation of children are weak \u2014 feeble and confined to wheelchairs \u2014 teetering on the brink of mortality their whole lives.\n\nBy swapping the roles of the old and the young, Tawada explores what it means to have a knowledge of one's finite passage in the world. The children have such profound sense of wisdom about what is important and what is not worth holding onto. It is sweet and funny and poignant on so many levels.\n\nSeverance, by Ling Ma\n\nThis book is a fascinating exploration of the millennial condition.\n\nA young woman continues working at her meaningless job despite the fact that the entire population is dying of a flu pandemic. Her job has literally no purpose anymore, but she continues to do paperwork, believing her immigrant parents' conviction that work in itself has meaning.\n\nThe flu has the odd effects of trapping people in a paralytic state of nostalgia, which also reflects the existential state of millennials who negotiate the reality of living in a post-internet world and replicate reality into nostalgic moments as they happen.\n\nFever Dream, by Samanta Schweblin\n\nThis is one of the most brilliant books I have read in years. It is almost written though it were a play.\n\nAt the beginning of the Fever Dream, we find a woman in a hospital bed and a small boy at her side. The boy asks cryptic questions, guiding the woman through her examination of past events that have led her to be in this sick, debilitated state.\n\nWe begin in absolute darkness and the narrative begins to create an odd story filled with sick animals, shape-shifting children and a neighbour in a gold bikini who may or may not be a foe.\n\nIt is terrifying and beautiful and profoundly strange. Everyone I know who has touched this book, has read it in one sitting.\n\nI cannot promise you will understand the ending \u2014 I didn't \u2014 but you will be moved by the startling details and the sense of unease that only a mysterious child narrator can command.

Clarence Prince.\n\n\"In reality, in my opinion, I think we're going to be approving the project for the one-third funding, because let's face it, if the other levels of government put in the one-third funding, we're going to be saying, 'Well, we'll put in our one-third.'\"\n\nPrince echoed Bruckschwaiger's concern and argued council should consider borrowing for a \"once in a lifetime\" project like the library in order to fund regular infrastructure needs.\n\nMayor Cecil Clarke reminded council that applying for grants is not the same as committing to spending.\n\nMayor Cecil Clarke says CBRM will not be going with a public-private partnership model to build a new library in Sydney.

If we don't apply, they can't make a decision for us to make a final approval.\"\n\nThe proposed library is being included in a private waterfront development project from Harbour Royale Development that is expected to include an apartment and commercial building, public amenities, an expanded hotel and relocation of the casino from George Street to the waterfront area where the former Royal Cape Breton Yacht Club was located.\n\nPublic-private partnership shot down\n\nCoun. Kendra Coombes asked about the wording of the staff request, noting it mentioned the possibility of a public-private partnership to build the library.\n\nHowever, Clarke and Phalen said the library project would not follow the public-private partnership model because the municipality would own the land and building from the start.\n\nThe model was mentioned as an option in a study done a couple of years ago, but it was not the preferred option, said Phalen."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Edmonton focuses on goal of bare pavement in snow removal", "description": "Edmonton is looking to get ahead of snow and ice on city streets rather than reacting when hit with a snowfall, Andrew Grant, infrastructure operations supervisor with the city said Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/snow-removal-edmonton-city-andrew-grant-1.4914847", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4012051.1488827416!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/snow-plow-edmonton.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:50:16Z", "content": "Edmonton is looking to get ahead of snow and ice on city streets rather than reacting when hit with a snowfall, Andrew Grant, infrastructure operations supervisor with the city said Wednesday.

They aren't technically plants, but they aren't moss either. They're a strange hybrid of fungus and algae that grow on trees or in water.\n\nFrances Anderson, a lichenologist, said lichen are vitally important to the health of Nova Scotia's ecosystems and provides a place for birds to nest and insects to hide from predators.\n\n\"So forest harvesting, of course, can take away the tree that they're on and it can also change tremendously the amount of moisture in the habitat that they're growing in,\" she said.\n\nLichen on trees provides shelter for tiny insects and material for nests. (Submitted by Frances Anderson)\n\nAnderson is the co-author of a book about lichens and spends her days up close and personal with the more than 900 species that grow in Nova Scotia.\n\nSeven species of lichen are listed as at risk. Some, like the boreal felt lichen, have protective regulations in place that restrict activity near them.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the other ones don't have the same legislative power, so although they're at risk, their habitat isn't as well known, it's not as mapped,\" she said.\n\nForest harvesting can take away the tree that lichen live on and also drastically change the amount of moisture in the habitat. (Submitted by Frances Anderson)\n\nBearded lichen and black ash may not be as cute as the piping plover and mainland moose, but Anderson and Blaney say ecosystems wouldn't exist without them.\n\nSome species of plants can only be found in this region of Canada and a handful of other locations around the world.\n\n\"Plants are of course the base level of all of our ecosystems. They're working in converting the sun's energy to food that's useable by all other organisms, ourselves included,\" said Blaney.\n\nSean Blaney said plants are the basis for all ecosystems. (Sean Basquill/Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources )\n\nAnd while plants may taste good and offer medicinal value, Blaney said that's not why they're worth protecting.\n\n\"I think we should value species for their intrinsic value as well.

Sign up here and it will be delivered directly to your inbox Monday to Friday.\n\nTODAY:\n\nTransportation technology entrepreneur Elon Musk got some bad news this week, but he's been tasting some success as well.\n\nResearchers are developing some new treatments for severe depression.\n\nMissed The National last night? Watch it here.\n\nElon Musk's lows and highs\n\nNASA doesn't like potheads.\n\nThat, apparently, is the not-so-hidden message being sent to Silicon Valley bad boy Elon Musk via a newly announced safety review of his private rocket company SpaceX.\n\nThe probe, first reported yesterday in the Washington Post, will also look at Boeing \u2014 the other firm that's been hired to eventually ferry U.S. astronauts to and from space \u2014 examining \"anything and everything\" that could potentially affect safety.\n\nBut sources within the space agency have told the paper that the review has been ordered because of the billionaire inventor's sometimes erratic behaviour, and particularly Musk's recent appearance on a podcast where he was filmed hauling on a large blunt.\n\nElon Musk smokes a joint during a Joe Rogan podcast livestreamed on the internet on Sept. 6. (Joe Rogan/YouTube)\n\nNASA won't officially confirm that, but its statement on the reasons for the review seems to make it clear enough, referencing requirements for workplace safety, \"including the adherence to a drug-free environment.\"\n\nOddly, the safety review won't actually examine SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket system, which has launched successfully 18 times so far this year.\n\nAnd there is no suggestion of any delay for the crewless SpaceX test flight to the International Space Station in January, nor the first test with astronauts aboard that's expected sometime next spring.\n\nHowever, the review will involve hundreds of interviews with SpaceX employees, and will be disruptive in terms of time and production.\n\nThe first SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket takes off from Cape Kennedy in Florida on Feb. 6. carrying Musk's cherry red Roadster from Tesla, his electric car company. (Cristobal Herrera/EPA-EFE)\n\nIt marks yet another controversy for Musk.\n\nTwo months ago, the entrepreneur was forced to step down as chair of Tesla, his electric car company, and pay a total of $40 million US in fines to the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of a settlement over a stock manipulation investigation stemming from a tweet.\n\nAnd the mercurial behaviour that has caused some colleagues and investors to express concerns about his health and mental well-being is still on display.\n\nJust this week, Musk has taken to Twitter to rename his planned Mars passenger spacecraft from BFR, the Big Falcon \u2014 or F**king \u2014 Rocket (depending on which source you believe), to the weirdly bland Starship.\n\nMusk talks to his workforce at the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., on Sept. 17 as he announces the world\u2019s first private passenger scheduled to fly around the Moon aboard SpaceX\u2019s BFR launch vehicle, (Gene Blevins/Reuters)\n\nHe revealed a whole new set of priorities for Tesla yesterday, suggesting that a still-conceptual pickup truck will now take priority over a previously announced semi-truck and a new version of the roadster.\n\nThe inventor is also locked in a fight with \"Big Tequila\" \u2014 Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council, to be precise \u2014 over his plans to market a Teslaquila brand of the agave-based spirit that may not meet the country's origin and quality requirements.\n\nYet Musk is tasting success as well.\n\nThis week, another Musk venture called the Boring Company completed a 3.2-kilometre test tunnel for the futuristic hyperloop transportation system it intends to build beneath Los Angeles.\n\nMore importantly, the Model 3 production problems that have dogged Tesla for the better part of a year seem to be easing. The company is currently making around 4,500 of its new mid-range electric cars a week, not far off the long-sought target of 5,000.\n\nThere are plans to crank up the line to 7,000 cars per week by end of this month. Musk is even guaranteeing delivery by the end of the year for all U.S. orders made by Nov. 30.\n\nTesla's showroom at the Sherway Gardens mall in Toronto. The company is currently producing around 4,500 of its new mid-range electric cars a week, nearing its target of 5,000. (Don Pittis/CBC)\n\nThe hedge funds that have been shorting Tesla stock, expecting the Model 3 to fail and the stock value to fall below $100 US, appear to be losing their bets. One major short-seller threw in the towel last month, and another is teetering on the edge. (As of early this afternoon, Tesla stock was trading at around $341 US a share, up almost $100 from early October.)\n\nAnd Musk has received an important vote of confidence from another science celebrity. In an interview with CNBC, Neil deGrasse Tyson predicted that Musk will be the tech entrepreneur who will end up having the biggest effect on the world.\n\n\"Elon Musk is trying to invent a future,\" said the famed astrophysicist and television host.\n\n\"He will transform civilization as we know it.\"\n\nAnd unlike NASA, deGrasse said he doesn't care if Musk occasionally gets \"high\" in the process.\n\nLike this newsletter?

Better known as shock treatment.\n\nOver the years, it's gotten a bad rap.\n\nWho can forget the controversial scene in One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, where Jack Nicholson gets a current of electricity through his head?\n\nYet despite the common side effect of memory loss, shock treatment is still considered the go-to treatment for severe depression when medication or therapy hasn't worked.\n\nSky Zazlov is prepped to receive MRI focused ultrasound therapy. She has suffered from treatment-resistant depression since 2011. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people suffer from depression, and it's the leading cause of disability worldwide. In Canada, almost a million people live with treatment-resistant depression.\n\nSo researchers have been looking at other non-invasive approaches to treat this illness.\n\nThey've come up with some new technology so precise it can pinpoint the exact location in the brain where the source of a person's depression lurks.\n\nIt's called MRI-guided focused ultrasound. Doctors use ultrasound beams to heat and disrupt the area of the brain affected by depression. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is currently in phase one of a clinical trial involving up to 10 patients who will undergo the procedure.\n\nKas Roussy is shown one of the promising therapies being studied in Canada for treatment-resistant depression. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nAnother treatment dispenses with electricity \u2014 instead, it uses magnets to stimulate the brain to induce a seizure. It's called magnetic seizure therapy, and unlike ECT, treatments with MST come with minimal memory loss.\n\n\"The amount of information about the brain is amplifying year to year,\" says Dr. Anthony Levitt, the chief of the Hurvitz Brain Sciences Program at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto.\n\n\"90 per cent of what we've learned about the brain, we've learned in the last 10 to 15 years.\"\n\nSome of what researchers have learned recently is the subject of tonight's story on The National.\n\n- Kas Roussy\n\nWATCH: Kas Roussy's story about different therapies now being used on patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, tonight on The National on CBC Television and streamed online\n\nA few words on ...\n\nA lunchtime blast from the past.\n\nQuote of the moment\n\n\"We see a risk of the country sleepwalking into instability.\"\n\n- Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president of the European Commission, after Brussels again rejected Italy's budget over debt and deficit concerns.\n\nEuropean Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis addresses a news conference in Brussels, Belgium, on Wednesday.

He testified for two-and-a-half days at the Muskrat Falls inquiry this week. (Terry Roberts/CBC)\n\nNalcor initially pursued a development of the larger Gull Island option, with the hope of selling electricity to Quebec, Ontario and elsewhere, and attracting the aluminum smelting industry to Labrador.\n\nVardy described this as \"grandiose notions of megaprojects that would transform the province through export revenues or through industrialization in Labrador.\"\n\nBut by 2010, Gull Island floundered because of opposition in Quebec and an inability to provide power cheap enough to entice industry to Labrador.\n\n'Disaster from the beginning'\n\nSo the focus shifted to the smaller Muskrat option, and the argument that it would be the least-cost option for Newfoundland's future electricity needs.\n\n\"The only thing that's constant throughout all of this is the Lower Churchill. We wanted to build a megaproject on the Lower Churchill,\" said Vardy, adding that other, less risky options were rejected before sufficient research could be completed.\n\nAnd despite requests for proposals from outside the province, documents suggest former premier Danny Williams favoured the so-called go-it-alone approach as early as 2006, with Harrington referencing Williams' \"strong preference\" for this in one of his first reports.\n\nThat's exactly what happened. Muskrat was sanctioned in late 2012, with the provincial government agreeing to pay any cost overruns, and electricity consumers in the province having to cover the cost of building the project.\n\nVardy said Muskrat was a \"disaster from the beginning.\"\n\nWe were building a project far bigger than anything we needed for a province of 500,000 people, with demographic projections showing a decline. - David Vardy\n\nAll-in costs have ballooned by more than $5 billion to nearly $13 billion (Vardy believes it will eventually go billions higher), and first power is not expected until 2019, two years behind schedule.\n\n\"We were building a project far bigger than anything we needed for a province of 500,000 people, with demographic projections showing a decline,\" Vardy said.\n\nAn onslaught of questions\n\nHarrington, meanwhile, joined what's called the Lower Churchill Project in late 2005, and was hand-picked by former Nalcor CEO Ed Martin.\n\nFormer Nalcor Energy CEO Ed Martin remains steadfast that the Muskrat Falls project, despite a stinging audit, was the best option for Newfoundland and Labrador. (Terry Roberts/CBC)\n\nHe served as overall project director for about a decade, earning just under $1,700 daily as a contractor. His role changed in 2016 after incoming CEO Stan Marshall, Martin's replacement, restructured things and put Harrington in charge of electricity generation at Muskrat Falls. His day-rate has since increased to just under $2,000, though Vardy has no issue with Harrington's rate of pay.\n\n\"In my opinion that rate of pay is not unreasonable for a project leader of a $12.7 billion project. I don't think this is a big issue,\" Vardy said.\n\nA group of oil men running a hydro project\n\nLike many in the project's inner circle, Harrington's background is in oil and gas. Muskrat was the first time he was tapped to direct a major project, with the responsibility to ensure schedule and cost estimates were delivered on time and on budget.\n\nThe project director for Muskrat Falls, Paul Harrington, exits the witness stand at the public inquiry Wednesday following two-and-a-half days of testimony. (Terry Roberts/CBC)\n\nHarrington faced a steady onslaught of questions about his experience and his role in the project, with considerable scrutiny on whether or not he did enough to highlight the risks, considering hydro projects are notorious for cost and schedule overruns.\n\nBut Harrington defended his work in the period leading up to project sanctioning, saying he followed industry practices and apprised Martin and Gilbert Bennett, another senior Nalcor executive, of the risks.\n\nAll I can do is identify what I believe to be the residual strategic risks. - Paul Harrington\n\n\"It's not my decision to decide that,\" Harrington said of the controversial decision to exclude any strategic risk allowance from the final cost estimates.\n\n\"All I can do is identify what I believe to be the residual strategic risks.\"\n\nVardy, meanwhile, said Harrington's testimony is further evidence that oversight and critical reviews were sorely lacking.\n\nVardy said a revelation that an independent review team was given just two weeks to scrutinize the project in 2012, several months prior to sanctioning, was \"absurd.\"\n\n\"Things were too pre-determined. Not enough latitude there for a free-ranging inquiry,\" he said.\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Stephanie Dubois", "title": "An accountant's search for halal food in Edmonton has started a new social media foodie community", "description": "One Edmonton man created social media accounts to help people find restaurants and grocery stores offering halal food in the city.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/yeghalal-food-edmonton-1.4913782", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4913897.1542756742!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/paul-shufelt-and-sabeeh-farooqui.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:00:00Z", "content": "Finding an Edmonton restaurant serving halal food was always a challenge for Sabeeh Farooqui.

There were smaller, mom and pop type restaurants but as many of his family members and friends discovered, there were still limited options.\n\nHe decided he had to do something.\n\nIn 2014, he created YegHalal, a Twitter account where he would post photos of halal food or names of restaurants selling halal dishes.\n\nAt first, it was just his family and friends who would monitor the account. But what he quickly discovered was that there was a hunger for a listing of Edmonton restaurants for the halal conscious.\n\nHalal is an Arabic term that means \"permitted\" or \"lawful\" in Islam. For religious reasons, Muslims are allowed to consume only halal meat, said Farooqui.\n\nAccording to Alberta Agriculture and Forestry's website, halal \"is both an umbrella term used in relationship to all food products, and a term that refers to a method of livestock slaughter consistent with Islamic rites.\"\n\nSharing halal options\n\nFour years since its creation, the YegHalal Twitter account now earns more than 30,000 impressions on tweets per month and the Facebook page has a growing audience province-wide.\n\n\"When people find out they have halal options, a light bulb goes off.

(Stephanie Dubois/CBC Edmonton)\n\nHe also takes the time to find halal-certified meat producers in the province. What he found is that many of the beef and chicken producers were already halal certified.\n\nTo Farooqui's delight, many of those producers were also already selling their products to restaurants in Edmonton. But the restaurants weren't advertising their meals as halal on their menus.\n\nHe began reaching out to those establishments and encouraged them to let customers know about their halal dishes.\n\n\"The response has been really positive.

(Stephanie Dubois/CBC Edmonton)\n\nShufelt said the food industry is changing, as customers become more knowledgeable about where their food comes from and how it is processed.\n\nIt's a movement that translates into the products they use in their dishes and how they prepare their food.\n\n\"I think over my career, I might have been asked once or twice a month [about halal dishes] 10 years ago. Now, we get a lot of phone calls asking if our beef is halal,\" he said.\n\nGrowing industry\n\nThe growth in the halal food industry isn't unique to Edmonton. In Canada, halal food sales exceeded $1 billion in 2017 and \"that will likely continue to grow rapidly,\" according to Alberta's Agriculture and Forestry department website.\n\nThe provincial website on halal meat partially attributes this increase in demand to consumers demanding more when it comes to food options, including \"curious millennials [who] are exploring food options, including halal.\"\n\nMany beef and poultry producers in Alberta already cater to a growing international market, said Farooqui.\n\nA seal from the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of Canada certifying that the product conforms to the requirements of halal. (CBC/Radio-Canada)\n\nHalal meat isn't just for Muslims, said Farooqui. Respectful slaughter and animal welfare make halal meat attractive to many for non-religious reasons, said Farooqui.\n\n\"The features of halal meat are becoming synonymous with where the beef industry, poultry industry is going towards anyways,\" he said. \"It's about sustainable food, organic food, healthy and local. The benefit for us is those options are halal already. Now it's about getting the word out there, getting other restaurants to use those options and have a new customer base.\"\n\nFarooqui hopes to capitalize on the growing demand for halal and plans to offer a detailed directory of restaurants and grocery stores in Edmonton, with the possibility of going province-wide.\n\n\"Doesn't matter what cultural background we have, what religion it is.

The system may be used to propel small drones and even lightweight aircraft, as an alternative to fossil fuel propulsion. (MIT Electric Aircraft Initiative)\n\nIt's not clear whether the technology could work at such a large scale, he said in a telephone interview. And even if it can, it would take a few decades to develop such planes, he said.\n\nBefore that, the approach might be used in airplane-like drones that perform tasks like environmental monitoring and surveillance, he said. As drones become more common in urban skies, the lack of noise would be an advantage in making them less bothersome to people on the ground, he said.\n\nThe Nature paper reports the results of 10 test flights inside an MIT athletic building. With a wingspan of about five metres (16 feet), the 2.45-kilogram) plane sailed along at about 17 kilometres per hour (11 miles per hour). Each flight covered about 55 metres (60 yards).\n\nBarrett, 35, said he was inspired as a child by watching Star Trek television episodes and movies, where he was struck by the shuttles that flew with no moving parts in their propulsion systems. He recalled thinking, \"There should be a way things should fly without having propellers and (jet) turbines.\"\n\nAs an adult, he focused on that and came across a concept called \"ionic wind.\"\n\nFor the MIT airplane, that involves a series of thin wires at the front of the plane that generate a powerful electric field. The field strips electrons from air molecules, turning the molecules into positively charged particles called ions. Those ions flow toward negatively charged parts of plane, colliding with ordinary air molecules and transferring energy to them. That produces a wind that provides thrust for the plane, Barrett explained.\n\nSimilar to spacecraft propulsion\n\nA similar process has long been used in outer space to propel some spacecraft, he said.\n\nA new MIT plane is propelled via ionic wind. Batteries in the fuselage (tan compartment in front of plane) supply voltage to electrodes (blue/white horizontal lines) strung along the length of the plane, generating a wind of ions that propels the plane forward. (Christine Y. He)\n\nBarrett said he hopes to find a way to eliminate the \"very slight buzz\" one can hear.\n\n\"I think they're onto something here,\" said Pat Anderson, a professor of aerospace engineering at the Daytona Beach, Florida, campus of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He had no role in the research.\n\nHe called the results impressive. But the experimental aircraft lacks the range and endurance to serve as a useful drone, and it's not clear whether the technology could be scaled up to fix that or become useful for propelling a passenger plane, he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Andrea Huncar", "title": "Young man's death prompts call from family to shut down Edmonton bar", "description": "Family and friends of a young Edmonton man who died after he was kicked out of The Ranch Roadhouse on a freezing Friday night are calling for the bar to be closed.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/ranch-roadhouse-mohamed-abdi-edmonton-bar-fatality-1.4914336", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4914587.1542819216!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mohamed-abdi.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:43:40Z", "content": "Family and friends of a young Edmonton man who died after he was kicked out of The Ranch Roadhouse on a freezing Friday night are calling for the bar to be closed.

The shock proved to be the impetus for her to co-found the Donor Conceived Alliance of Canada.\n\n\"For many people, the feeling of genetic bewilderment is very real and can be very damaging,\" says Splawinski about finding out her biological father, an American, was legally compensated for donating his sperm in the United States.\n\n\"To know that there was a monetary exchange in order to create you, for me is a little bit disgusting.\"\n\nHer organization wants:\n\nCriminal penalties for unlawful financial compensation maintained.\n\nBirth certificates to have information about donor ancestry and biological parents.\n\nA national donor conception registry.\n\nA ban on donor anonymity.\n\nA limit on the number of human beings created through donor conception.\n\nAthena Reich, 42, is a Canadian-American single mother and lesbian living in Toronto. She previously resided in New York City for some 16 years. She strongly supports Bill C-404.\n\nReich carried and gave birth to a son conceived through American sperm and egg donation. She now hopes to conceive a second child using the same American sperm donor, but this time with a Canadian egg donor. Her children will share a biological father.\n\nReich believes that compensation would make donation more competitive, in turn attracting more educated, fertile young women. Further, she argues that payment would make women more accountable in fulfilling their side of the bargain.\n\nLucky or buying a service?\n\nAs someone who has spent a significant amount of money and time to become a mother, Reich recounts the emotional turmoil of the possibility of losing an egg donor at the last minute because the donor simply changed her mind.\n\n\"The whole framework here [in Canada] is 'Oh, I'm so lucky and I should just be so grateful that they're donating.' Well actually, I'm shelling out tens of thousands of dollars, so am I lucky or am I really buying a service? Whether you call it that or not \u2014 if I'm buying a service, don't I deserve quality and don't I deserve somebody who's committed, who's not going to flake out on me?\" says Reich.\n\nHousefather and intended parents like Reich believe that legalizing financial compensation for donors and surrogates would make assisted reproduction safer, more affordable and easier.\n\nBut some donor-conceived adults like Martin and Splawinski, however, think it will result in more people facing the psychological turmoil of wondering where they came from and possibly open the door to a new form of child trafficking."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jane Van-Koeverden", "title": "3 N.L. authors among 13 Canadians nominated for \u20ac100,000 International Dublin Literary Award", "description": "141 books based on nominations from libraries worldwide are on the longlist.

A mediator has been appointed by the federal labour minister to settle the dispute. (Frank Gunn/Canadian Press)\n\nBy 2011, the Canada Post Group of Companies, which includes subsidiary Purolator Holdings Ltd., and others, was handling about 10 billion pieces of mail a year for a 1.8-billion drop from 2007.\n\nLast year, total volume came in at 8.4 billion as the service has sustained a steady drop in its core business of transaction mail made of up letters, bills, statements, invoices and other paperwork that's now gone digital.\n\nIn response, the company switched emphasis to its parcel service, which for years had stayed at a fairly stable level.\n\nBut the transition hasn't been easy, said Lee, since unlike letter mail, parcel services have stiff competition from major international players like UPS and Fed Ex.\n\n\"People say, OK, well great, you lost one product line, you get another product line. It's not that simple \u2026 this is a very competitive space; there is no monopoly.\"\n\nStill, a rapid rise in overall parcels being sent out to consumers has helped Canada Post record significant gains in the space.\n\nLast year, parcel revenue came in at $2.1 billion, or about 33 per cent of Canada Post revenue, up from about $1.3 billion or 21 per cent of revenue in 2011.\n\nParcel volume has climbed from about 143 million packages in 2011 to 242 million last year for an almost 70 per cent increase.\n\nIn a 2016 annual report, Canada Post said it delivered nearly two-thirds of online orders by Canadians.\n\nCanada Post, which for over 200 years was a protected monopoly of the state, is dying before our eyes, but the culture hasn't caught up. - Ian Lee, business prof, Carleton University\n\nLee said the service has been competitive, offering somewhat cheaper rates than private operators, but it's been saddled with labour costs, a large pension obligation, and a culture slow to change.\n\n\"Canada Post, which for over 200 years was a protected monopoly of the state, is dying before our eyes, but the culture hasn't caught up,\" he said.\n\nIdle Canada Post trucks sit in the parking lot of the Saint-Laurent sorting facility in Montreal, on Nov. 15.

Parcel deliveries is a way to offset some of its costly obligations, said Bird.\n\n\"Canada Post, in raw political terms, it provides mail and package delivery services to rural and small town Canada, and the North, places where private companies provide limited service, if at all.\"\n\nA striking Canada Post worker walks the picket line in front of the Saint-Laurent facility, on Nov. 15. Companies have been using the strikes to encourage customers to switch to online billing. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)\n\nThe requirements of delivery are what pushed the service into the community mailbox program and away from door-to-door delivery, a move that was expected to save about $400 million a year before the Trudeau government shelved the plan.\n\nDespite steady declines of between four and eight per cent per year, letter mail still provides the bulk of Canada Post's revenues. Last year, transactional mail pulled in $2.9 billion to make up 45 per cent of revenue, down from $3.2 billion or 54 per cent in 2011. Advertising, or direct marketing mail, makes up the other main segment for the service at $1.1 billion in revenue last year.\n\nThe strike threatens its core business further, since companies have been using it to encourage more people to switch to digital, said Bird.\n\n\"Every single company that still provides paper letters, paper bills to people, is trying to use these rotating strikes to make even more people go on to electronic bills and get rid of paper.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Totem pole represents new health-care relationship between government and First Nations, artist says", "description": "First Nations leaders and politicians were on hand for the dedication of the Crossing Cultures and Healing totem pole on Blanshard Street on Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-totem-pole-first-nations-government-health-care-1.4914294", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4914363.1542812677!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/totem-pole-victoria-health-ministry.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:05:58Z", "content": "A new totem pole designed to further reconciliation and to honour the carvers' own mother has been unveiled next to the provincial health ministry building in Victoria.

The body of the 69-year-old multimillionaire was discovered face down in a pool of blood in his Saint John office on the morning of July 7, 2011. He had suffered 45 blows to his head, neck and hands.\n\nIn December 2015, the jury at Dennis Oland's first trial found him guilty of second-degree murder, but the New Brunswick Court of Appeal overturned his conviction in October 2016, citing an error in the judge's instructions to the jury.\n\nRetrial underway\n\nThe retrial started in Saint John's Court of Queen's Bench on Wednesday, with Justice Terrence Morrison presiding.\n\nIt was supposed to be a judge and jury trial, but Morrison declared a mistrial Tuesday and discharged the 16 jurors after learning a Saint John police officer conducted \"improper\" background checks on prospective jurors during last month's jury selection.\n\n\"I have determined that it's in the best interest of justice that a mistrial be declared thereby ensuring that any further trial of this matter will not be tainted,\" he told the jurors before sending them home.\n\nBecause the trial is proceeding by judge alone, the publication ban on pre-trial hearings held over the past year about various motions and the admissibility of evidence is now lifted.\n\nJuries normally hear murder cases\n\nThe records show Oland's defence lawyers advised the court last fall that they intended to apply to have the retrial heard by a judge alone or, in the alternative, for a change of venue, to safeguard his Charter right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\n\nNormally, all homicide trials in Canada are heard by a judge and jury, as stipulated by the Criminal Code. An accused can request to be tried without a jury, but the attorney general must consent.\n\nIn July 2017 \u2014 as soon as the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed requests by both parties to review the Oland case \u2014 the defence asked lead Crown prosecutor P.J. Veniot to consent to a judge-alone trial. He refused \"without explanation,\" they said.\n\nAttorney general wouldn't explain\n\nOver the next three months, the defence took the request to the assistant deputy attorney general, deputy attorney general and attorney general, citing the pre-trial publicity. None agreed and no reasons were given, the defence said.\n\nThe New Brunswick Public Prosecution Operational Manual states the Crown shall consent to a defence request for the trial of a murder charge by judge alone \"unless there are exceptional circumstances,\" Oland's lawyers pointed out.\n\nAnd when consent is withheld, the Crown is supposed to note the reason in the file.\n\n\"In the absence of reasons \u2026 the refusal decision has the appearance of being arbitrary, capricious, and/or based on some oblique or improper motive,\" the defence argued.\n\nThe Crown later said an incorrect version of policy revisions was published in error and the decision to refuse consent is prosecutorial discretion.\n\nCited books, TV coverage\n\nOland's lawyers wanted Morrison to overrule the Crown's refusal. They cited \"thousands\" of media reports, social media postings and reader comments, two national bestseller books, The Fifth Estate documentary The Richard Oland Case: Murder in the Family, and CBC's online publication of Dennis Oland's full videotaped statement to police on July 7, 2011, the day his father's body was discovered.\n\nMuch of the publicity \"demonstrates bias\" against Oland or \"is otherwise prejudicial,\" his lawyers said.\n\nOther reasons a judge-alone trial was preferable, they said, included the \"onerous\" jury selection procedures and the nature of the evidence, which involves \"complicated and challenging legal and factual issues requiring disciplined consideration and reasoning \u2026 [that] would necessitate lengthy and complex jury instructions.\"\n\nThere is a strong societal interest in having an accused tried by a jury of his peers which reflects the values and concerns of the community where the offence occurred. -Terrence Morrison, Court of Queen's Bench\n\nThe defence sought permission to survey prospective jurors from Oland's 2015 trial who were not selected or jury panel members from other trials held in Saint John, Moncton and Fredericton this year.\n\n\"This would limit the poll to the type of persons who would respond to a jury duty summons\" and \"enhance the reliability\" of conclusions,\" Oland's former defence lawyer Gary Miller explained in a letter to the judge.\n\nIt would also avoid polling people who were either ineligible for jury service or qualified for an exemption, he said.\n\nHired polling company\n\nMorrison denied the application. He ruled contacting people who reported for jury duty at Oland's first trial would violate the Jury Act.\n\n\"In my view, jurors have a right to expect that they will not be identified, contacted or asked to participate in a poll simply because they have fulfilled their civic and statutory duty,\" Morrison wrote.\n\nThe defence instead had MQO Research conduct a telephone poll of jury-eligible residents of Saint John, Moncton and Fredericton.\n\nThe 24-question survey was \"designed to measure familiarity with Dennis Oland and the criminal matter \u2026 to measure community sentiment regarding Dennis Oland, the presumption of innocence, willingness to serve on a jury, and other related variables,\" the survey report says.\n\nIt was designed with input from the Crown, the courtroom heard.\n\nA total of 1,203 surveys were completed using landline and cellphone numbers between April 11 and May 19 \u2014 401 people in each city, resulting in an overall margin of error of roughly plus or minus five per cent.\n\nBased on the results, the defence abandoned its request for a change of venue.\n\nSlight differences among cities\n\n\"The polling evidence does not support any real difference in the jurisdictions,\" lead defence lawyer Alan Gold told the court.\n\nIn fact, the percentage of people who said they believed Oland was guilty was slightly higher in both Moncton and Fredericton at 28 per cent each, compared with 27 per cent in Saint John, the survey report shows.\n\nAlan Gold, Dennis Oland's defence lawyer, told the court the poll didn't reveal much difference in opinion among respondents in the three cities. (CBC)\n\nAt a two-week hearing in June, the defence also presented the supplemental report that looked at the relationship between respondents wanting to serve on the Oland jury and the belief he is guilty.\n\nAbout 45 per cent of respondents who said they \"very much\" wanted to serve believed Oland was guilty.\n\nThe defence suggested there was a significant risk of selecting a jury consisting of several persons with pre-existing opinions of guilt.\n\nTrusts jurors to have open minds\n\nThe judge said he had difficulty with the defence's premise that those who demonstrated a willingness to serve on a jury were a better proxy for the subject jury population than the general population, and the defence proposition that almost half of those who would likely form the jury believe that Oland is guilty.\n\n\"The mere fact that any individual may wish to serve (or not to serve) on a jury is not determinative of jury service,\" said Morrison.\n\nWhile he agreed there was a greater chance a willing person may not try to be excused, he disagreed a significant number would tailor their responses during the selection process to get a place on the jury.\n\nMorrison said the three experts called to testify at the hearing \u2014 two for the defence and one for the Crown \u2014 all agreed that how the data is presented is \"determined by what 'story' one wants to tell.\"\n\n\"In short, the data \u2026 is subject to a great deal of interpretation. I therefore believe that I must exercise a great degree of caution.\"\n\nThe survey suggested a \"meaningful segment\" of the Saint John population holds a preconceived opinion of guilt, he said, but 70 per cent of respondents said they could keep an open mind.\n\nSome areas not polled\n\nThe judge also expressed concerns about some elements of the polling. For example, a portion of the Saint John judicial district from which the jury panel would be drawn was inadvertently omitted from the survey.\n\n\"As a result, the sample is not truly a representative one,\" he said.\n\nOland lives just outside Saint John in the town of Rothesay.\n\nIn addition, the survey did not screen for all jury ineligibility criteria, as set out in the provincial Jury Act.\n\nIn the end, Morrison said, he wasn't convinced a fair and impartial jury could not be empanelled, and he dismissed the defence application.\n\nJury brings 'common sense' to trial\n\n\"A jury trial has long been recognized as a cornerstone of our democracy,\" he wrote in his 64-page decision.\n\n\"There is a strong societal interest in having an accused tried by a jury of his peers which reflects the values and concerns of the community where the offence occurred.\n\n\"The very strength of the jury lies in the determination of guilt or innocence by ordinary citizens who, although not legal experts, bring a healthy measure of common sense to the trial process.\"\n\nJury selection ended up going much faster than expected.

It's the latest development of a pledge by the global television powerhouse to spend $500 million over five years on Canadian productions, a number Netflix recently said it will exceed.\n\nBoon, or bust?\n\nWelcomed by some as a boon to a subsidy-dependent film industry, the announcement in September 2017 was not without controversy, particularly in Quebec.\n\nThen-federal heritage minister Melanie Joly drew criticism for opting not to require the California-based company to charge sales tax on its subscriptions, as its domestic competitors are required to do.\n\nNetflix also sidestepped the rules that apply to the country's broadcasting companies, landing outside regulations to funnel a portion of their revenues to the creation of Canadian programming.\n\nIt did agree to shell out $25 million on a strategy to develop the francophone and cultural minority market, but avoided any contractual obligations to do so.\n\n\"Netflix is a particularly puzzling and difficult company in terms of adapting Canadian policy to actually capturing this new business mode,'' said Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst at the C.D. Howe Institute.\n\nCanadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission regulations require broadcasters to air a certain percentage of Canadian content. Netflix, however, doesn't control the amount of content that gets streamed \u2014 its subscribers determine that daily.\n\nWhether Netflix should pay into the Canadian Media Fund, as the country's cable and satellite distributors are required to do, is similarly fuzzy, Wyonch said, since the company has claimed it would not have access to the fruits of that fund.\n\nOttawa launched an expert panel last June to review broadcasting and telecommunications laws, with an eye to including Netflix in cultural funding requirements. An interim report is due in June 2019.\n\nCurrent rules also allow streaming services that do not maintain a physical presence in Canada to avoid collecting or remitting federal or provincial sales taxes.\n\nThe European Union, Australia and Japan have all levelled the playing field among foreign and domestic digital service providers, taxing them similarly. Quebec is on track to do likewise in January, slapping a provincial sales tax on any purchases from Netflix, Amazon, iTunes, Spotify and other online services based abroad.\n\n\"The key question is, would this movie have been made anyway, without the no-tax deal with Ottawa?'' Wyonch said. \"Netflix is a global company. French is not exactly a small language.''\n\nNetflix produces films and television shows in more than 20 countries, dubbing and subtitling them as part of a content budget of between $12 billion and $13 billion, Wyonch said. That beats HBO's expenditures several times over.\n\n'Refreshing' alternative\n\nHelene Messier, head of an association that represents 150 independent Quebec production companies in film, television and online, called the Quebec announcement \"excellent news,'' with a qualifier.\n\n\"I hope it's an indication of many more contributions. I think that we won't know until a few years from now,'' she said. \"But I think that they understand our market and what our creative people have to offer.''\n\nFor Lalibert\u00e9 and the six-year-old Couronne Nord \u2014 a Montreal production house whose name refers to the off-island suburbs where he and his two-colleagues grew up \u2014 the arrival of Netflix offers a \"really refreshing'' alternative to the go-to sources of funding in Quebec, primarily the SODEC funding agency and Telefilm Canada.\n\n\"It's a game-changer in Montreal,'' said Guillaume Laurin, the film's 28-year-old content producer.\n\n\"Private funding doesn't exist; it's not in the cultural mindset.

I had no idea this was all going to happen.\"\n\n'One Hitter Wonders'\n\nNot thinking it would catch on, Short began signing his pieces with the alias \"One Hitter Wonders\" \u2014 a play on words inspired by the device he uses to smoke the medical cannabis prescribed to help ease the symptoms associated with MS.\n\n\"Every time I used to do it my father would make fun of me and say I had a 'vision' and that's why I wanted to do something with art,\" said Short.\n\n\"So I'd say 'well, it's a one hitter wonder'. I thought it was hilarious at the time and lo and behold, it caught on and I mean, you can't change it now.\"\n\nOriginally from Burgeo, Short said a lot of his work is inspired by his love of Newfoundland.\n\nMost of Short's pieces have a nature theme \u2014 something he says comes from his love of Newfoundland and his hometown of Burgeo. He makes a point, however, of ensuring that each piece of unique in its own way.\n\nHis friends and family help him find reclaimed wood from all over the island \u2014 whether it's from a demolished playground or an old car \u2014 so no two pieces of art are identical.\n\nIt doesn't compare to the rush of working in the hospital emergency department, but Short said he's found satisfaction in creating art for others to love and enjoy.\n\n\"I don't want to be left alone with thoughts all day, I know that much, because eventually you start thinking about the past,\" he said from his workshop.\n\n\"I think that's what led me to come out here. It saved me big time. It must be a therapy.\"\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "'Much ado about nothing': Edmonton ER evacuated over replica handgun", "description": "The emergency room at a southeast Edmonton hospital was evacuated Wednesday morning after a man with a replica handgun took a seat in the emergency room.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-police-grey-nuns-hospital-replica-handgun-1.4914350", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1916597.1515447806!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/li-nurses-hospital-bed.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:16:34Z", "content": "The emergency room at a southeast Edmonton hospital was evacuated Wednesday morning after a man with a replica handgun took a seat in the waiting room. \"We're just dealing with this individual right now,\" Staff Sgt.

Visits to the island are heavily restricted by the government.\n\nThe Sentinelese people live on the small forested island and are known to resist all contact with outsiders, often attacking anyone who comes near.\n\nPathak identified the American as John Allen Chau and said he was believed to be 26 years old and from Alabama. He was apparently killed by arrows, but the cause of death could not be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak said told The Associated Press.\n\nPolice have approached anthropologists with contacts on the island in an effort to visit and recover the body, Pathak said.\n\nHe said Chau arrived in the region on Oct. 16 and stayed in a hotel while he prepared to visit the prohibited island. He had earlier visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2015 and 2016,\u200b Pathak said. North Sentinel is in the Andaman Islands where the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea meet.\n\nDeadly case of 'misdirected adventure'\n\nHe said Chau organized his visit to the island through a friend who hired seven fishermen for $325 US to take him there on a boat, which also towed his kayak.\n\nChau went ashore in his kayak on Nov. 15 and sent the boat with the fishermen out to sea to avoid detection, Pathak said. He interacted with some members of the tribe, giving them gifts he had prepared such as a football and fish. But the tribes members became angry and shot an arrow at him which apparently hit a book he was carrying, Pathak said.\n\nThe American's kayak became damaged, so he swam to the fishermen's boat, which was waiting at a prearranged location. There he spent the night and wrote out his experiences on pages of paper which he gave to the fishermen, Pathak said. He set out again to meet the tribes members on Nov. 16.\n\nBut on the morning of the following day, the waiting fishermen saw from a distance his body being dragged by tribesmen. They left for Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where they informed Chau's friend, who notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nHe said the family got in touch with Indian police and U.S. consular officials.\n\n\"It was a case of misdirected adventure,\" he said.\n\nPolice arrested the seven fishermen and charged them with endangering the life of the American by taking him to a prohibited area, Pathak said.\n\nTourists banned from area\n\nKathleen Hosie, spokesperson for the U.S. Consulate in Chennai, the capital of southern Tamil Nadu state, said it was aware of reports concerning an American in the islands.\n\n\"When a U.S. citizen is missing, we work closely with local authorities as they carry out their search efforts,\" Hosie said. She said she could not comment further due to privacy considerations.\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said the killing of the American should prompt Indian authorities to properly protect the lands of the Sentinelese and other Andaman tribes.\n\n\"The British colonial occupation of the Andaman Islands decimated the tribes living there, wiping out thousands of tribespeople, and only a fraction of the original population now survives. So the Sentinelese fear of outsiders is very understandable,\" Stephen Corry, the group's director, said in a statement.\n\nShiv Viswanathan, a social scientist and a professor at Jindal Global Law School, said North Sentinel Island was a protected area and not open to tourists.\n\n\"The exact population of the tribe is not known, but it is declining. The government has to protect them,\" Viswanathan said.\n\nPoachers are known to fish illegally in the waters around the island, catching turtles and diving for lobsters and sea cucumbers.\u200b Tribe members killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Two injured after fall from cliff in Edworthy Park", "description": "A woman in her late teens and a man in his early 20s were taken to Foothills hospital in serious condition after falling in the area known as Dead Man's Cliff.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-edworthy-park-cliff-fall-dead-man-s-cliff-1.4914327", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4604658.1522857749!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/calgary-6155-ems-emergency-medical-services-paramedic-ambulance.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:03:45Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Two people are in hospital after falling off a cliff in Edworthy Park, in southwest Calgary.\n\nEMS says they responded early Wednesday morning after two people were injured in an area known as Dead Man's Cliff.\n\nA woman in her late teens and a man in his early 20s were taken to Foothills hospital in serious but stable condition.\n\nEMS said getting to the people was a challenge."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Nola Keeler", "title": "Free Fun: What you need to know about the Grey Cup Festival today", "description": "With more than 50 events at the Grey Cup Festival in downtown Edmonton, deciding what to do can be overwhelming.

The victory has Edmonton sitting one point back of the winless-in-six Vancouver Canucks for the final playoff spot in the Pacific Division with two games in hand.\n\nIf you think Chiarelli pushed the panic button in making his move, you're right. After all, haven't the Oilers changed the coaching position enough with this being their eight such moves in 11 seasons?\n\nWatch the Oilers upend the Sharks:\n\nEdmonton edges San Jose 4-3 in overtime, Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl 3 points each. 2:09\n\nWith U.S. Thanksgiving fast approaching, which coincides with the first-quarter mark of the season, difficult decisions for NHL teams are contemplated and made at this time of the year.\n\nThe Oilers, who had dropped six of their previous seven games before Tuesday, were the fourth team this fall to fire their coach, following St. Louis (Mike Yeo), Chicago (Joel Quenneville) and Los Angeles (John Stevens). But coaching changes this early in the season shouldn't be a surprise.\n\nMore startling is the fact no team made an in-season head-coaching change last season.\n\nHowever, the Calgary Flames, Carolina Hurricanes, Dallas Stars, New York Islanders, New York Rangers and Washington Capitals made moves behind the bench in the off-season.\n\nTime for a turnaround\n\nNot all coaching changes are effective. If a GM or ownership group wants to make a coaching change, often the opening 20 games can work with ample time for a turnaround.\n\nTake last year \u2014 without any coaching changes. Of the 16 teams in playoff position at U.S. Thanksgiving, 11 kept their spot to advance to the Stanley Cup tournament in April.\n\nIn the East, the Boston Bruins and Philadelphia Flyers were one and four points, respectively, out of the playoffs at this time last year. But, in the end, they were able to rally and displace the Detroit Red Wings and Islanders.\n\nIn the West, the Colorado Avalanche, Minnesota Wild and Anaheim Ducks were in a logjam, tied for the final playoff position, but didn't have the tiebreaker. They made the playoffs, however, beating out the teams they were tied with at U.S. Thanksgiving in the Calgary, St. Louis and Vancouver.\n\nChange of address\n\nHere are four other interesting first-quarter developments:\n\nIt was a given the off-season additions of Erik Karlsson and John Tavares would improve the San Jose Sharks and Toronto Maple Leafs, respectively. While Karlsson has yet to find his form, Tavares has produced and found a prolific early season partnership with Mitch Marner.\n\nBut not to be overlooked has been the play of newcomers Jeff Skinner with the Buffalo Sabres, Mike Hoffman of the Florida Panthers, Max Domi with the Montreal Canadiens and Ryan O'Reilly in St. Louis.\n\nThe 27-year-old O'Reilly never has scored more than 28 goals in his first nine seasons, but he's on pace for 40-plus this year.\n\nO'Reilly's absence in Buffalo allowed the Sabres to land Jeff Skinner. His 14 goals in 21 games have him among the league leaders and on his way to surpassing the career-high 37 goals he scored in Carolina two years ago. His offence has helped the Sabres win six games in a row.\n\nDomi has a 10-game points streak (five goals, 14 points) going and already has scored 10 times this fall, one better than his goal totals in each of the previous two seasons.\n\nHoffman is riding a franchise-record 16-game points streak (nine goals, 19 points) and scored a goal in his return to his old team, the Ottawa Senators, on Monday.\n\nChange of address II\n\nAs mentioned, six teams made head coaching changes in the off-season: Calgary (Bill Peters), Carolina (Rod Brind'Amour), Dallas (Jim Montgomery), Islanders (Barry Trotz), Rangers (David Quinn) and Washington (Todd Reirden). Each club has benefited from its change behind the bench.\n\nThe Flames and Stars are in playoff position in the West as are the Rangers and Capitals in the East. Trotz has the Islanders only a point out of the playoff spot in the Metropolitan Division and the Hurricanes are a point behind the Islanders.\n\nCross-Canada checkup\n\nThe Jets and Maple Leafs, the only two Canadian-based NHL teams to make the 2017-18 playoffs, were expected to perform as well as they have so far this season. But the Flames, Canadiens, Canucks and Senators have exceeded expectations in the first quarter. The Oilers are about right where I thought they would be.\n\nThe Flames have benefited from the arrival of new coach Peters, and three players who joined him from the Hurricanes, Elias Lindholm, Noah Hanifin and Derek Ryan.\n\nThe Habs currently are in a playoff position. They have done it with a relentless forecheck and speed, and without a return to form from goalie Carey Price. He ranks 44th in save percentage at .900. If Price gets going and his teammates keep up their diligent play, maybe they sneak into the playoffs.\n\nThe Canucks and Senators unlikely will be in the post-season. Most felt they would be battling it out for the basement. Who thought they would be challenging for a playoff spot?\n\nBoth teams have struggled lately. The Canucks have lost five in a row. But they're still fun to watch with super rookie Elias Pettersson and his 12 goals in 17 games. Ditto for the Senators, who have lost eight of their last 12, but have exciting young defenceman Thomas Chabot. The 21-year-old from Saint-Marie, Que. has five goals and 24 points, double the production of Karlsson's goal and 12 points in San Jose.\n\nStanley Cup final preview?\n\nThe first-quarter has allowed several Stanley Cup contenders to skate into the forefront, like the Maple Leafs, Jets, Sharks, Columbus Blue Jackets, Tampa Bay Lightning and Nashville Predators. But, if you had to choose, which two teams that have stood out and look to be Stanley Cup-Final bound?\n\nHow about the Predators and Lightning? The two teams just happened to clash in Music City on Monday with the home team defeating the Andrei Vasilevskiy-less Lightning 3-2. Tampa Bay's prized goalie is out with a broken foot.\n\nThe Predators and Lightning are playoff-hardened teams. The Predators went to the final in 2017. The Lightning was there in 2015 as well as two trips to the East final in 2016 and again last spring. If these two clubs stay healthy, I like a Nashville-Tampa Bay final in June, judging from what both teams have exhibited in the first quarter."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Officers who shot and killed man won't be charged, police watchdog says", "description": "Bradley Thomas Clattenburg, 24, died after a confrontation with police in Westphal, N.S., in the early morning hours of May 26.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/sirt-decision-police-shooting-bradley-clattenburg-1.4914289", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4679433.1527343409!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/many-emergency-services-vehicles-are-on-the-scene.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:50:22Z", "content": "No charges will be laid against RCMP officers who shot and killed a man in Westphal, N.S., in May, the province's police watchdog has concluded.

He also pointed the loaded shotgun at other members of the family.\n\nHe said he wanted to go to the hospital to have the listening device removed from his head. The man convinced Clattenburg that the microchip, and the audio he was hearing, was intended for someone else.\n\nAfter an 18-minute confrontation, Clattenburg left the house, but said he would return in two hours, and if his girlfriend was not there, he would kill the whole family.\n\nInto the woods\n\nClattenburg then ran into woods with the gun and was tracked by a police dog and officer for about 25 minutes. Officers found four live shotgun shells, a white rubber glove, a black baseball cap and the stock of a firearm in the woods.\n\nWhen he emerged, Clattenburg walked out between two buildings on Broom Road.\n\nOne officer told him to drop his weapon, but Clattenburg didn't comply. As he walked along, he held the loaded and operable sawed-off shotgun pointed at his chin, with his hand near the trigger, according to the report.\n\nTwo other officers arrived and also commanded Clattenburg to drop his gun, but he refused to do so. Eventually, Clattenburg got \"boxed in\" by a rock wall and stopped walking.\n\n\"The male turned his head, and, looking at the officers, placed his gun level to his waist and pointed it in the direction of the officers,\" a news release from SIRT said.\n\nFearing for the safety of themselves and others, the three officers fired a total of four shots in less than two seconds, three of which hit Clattenburg \u2014 two in the abdomen and one in the leg. He died shortly afterwards.\n\nSIRT's director, Felix Cacchione, said the officers \"were forced to make a split-second decision when faced with the threat posed by [Clattenburg],\" and that RCMP officers may discharge a gun at a person to protect someone from grievous bodily harm or death.\n\nIn investigating the case, SIRT obtained statements from all officers who responded to the call, 12 civilians and five paramedics.\n\nSIRT investigates any serious incidents involving police in Nova Scotia and is responsible for making decisions about charges."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "B.C.'s ride-hailing restrictions will stall service, critics say", "description": "Drivers for services like Uber and Lyft will need to have Class 4 licences to operate in the province, which means they'll have to undergo criminal record checks and medical fitness checks every five years.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ride-hailing-restrictions-stall-service-1.4914074", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4703478.1528842256!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/uber-surcharge-proposal.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:45:16Z", "content": "The fanfare surrounding the B.C. government's announcement about ride-hailing legislation has sounded a disappointing note for many, who say what's being promised is a watered down version of the service.

It's a grief reaction,\" he said.\n\nRhonda McMeekin, who delivered her daughter Everlee Rose stillborn in 2013, said it's clear how little thought is put into the mental health of women who have experienced loss.\n\n\"The psychologist that is responsible for dealing with women who've gone through loss, the women's health psychologist, her office is directly across from the case room,\" McMeekin said in an interview with CBC News.\n\n\"When you sit and wait for your appointment, you're sitting looking in through the window where families are waiting for babies to be born. And I'm six years out from my loss, and when I go to my appointments there I still have panic attacks because that is a trigger for me.\"\n\nSince CBC first aired the story on Tuesday, several other men and women have spoken about their own troubling experiences in the health care system.\n\nAfter having a life-saving hysterectomy I was also placed in a room with a new mom and her baby. My dream of having another child was gone and I was devastated. The nurses were fantastic to me and moved the other woman to a different room. I was fortunate that it was an option. \u2014@rowsell_darlene\n\nI was a mom of a new baby in the room w/ a mom whose baby was stillborn. I sobbed/desperately begged my newborn to stop crying all night. Knowing that mother had to hear my daughter cry was unbearable for me. I can't imagine how unbearable it was for her. This needs to change. \u2014@sarahflemingNL\n\nHaggie acknowledges that the health care system as a whole needs to find a better way to integrate mental health and emotional support into physical care.\n\n\"To be perfectly honest it's very difficult to shelter people from these kind of things.

He also received $15,000 from CNN as a legal commentator, according to the documents released Tuesday by the Justice Department, in addition to a salary just over $100,000 from his work at an Iowa law firm.\n\nThe nonprofit group, known as FACT, styles itself as a nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group is supposed to serve the public interest without supporting or opposing specific candidates for office. However, its challenges and its website have focused largely, though not exclusively, on Democrats and their party.\n\nWhitaker used his role as president and executive director of FACT in 2016 as a platform to question the ethics of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nSeveral news outlets, including The Associated Press, and outside groups had requested the documents after President Donald Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions and elevated Whitaker to the top Justice Department post on Nov. 7.\n\nThe documents show that Whitaker began revising his public disclosures the day he was appointed acting attorney general. He revised the forms four more times, including on Tuesday.\n\nIn a disclosure form Whitaker completed when he joined the Justice Department in September 2017, he reported receiving $1,875 in legal fees from a company called World Patent Marketing. Whitaker has come under scrutiny for his involvement with the company, which was accused of misleading consumers and is under investigation by the FBI.\n\nNot required to list their donors\n\nWhitaker also disclosed his partial interest in a family farm in Ely, Iowa, that he valued at between $100,000 and $250,000. The forms also included disclosures of $20,000 to $30,000 in credit card debt in 2017.\n\nFACT drew its funds from 2014-2016 mainly from Donor's Trust, another nonprofit designed to provide anonymity to conservative and libertarian donors. Though such tax-exempt groups can legally withhold the identity of their contributors and generally do so, there may be a distinct irony when a group dedicated to transparency keeps its funding sources in the shadows.\n\nWhitaker's appointment has been criticized by Democrats who have challenged its constitutionality and are concerned that he will interfere with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Senate's top Democrat asked the Justice Department's watchdog to investigate communications between Whitaker and the White House.\n\nSen. Charles Schumer asked the inspector general to look into whether Whitaker had access to confidential grand jury information in Mueller's probe. Schumer also wants investigators to examine whether Whitaker shared information with Trump or others in the administration.\n\nJohn Lavinsky, a spokesperson for the inspector general, declined to comment on Schumer's request.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, had been overseeing the special counsel's Russia investigation until Whitaker's appointment. Whitaker is now overseeing the investigation.\n\nSchumer and other Democrats have said they are concerned about Whitaker's past criticism of the Mueller probe, which is looking at Russian interference in the 2016 election and ties to Trump's campaign.\n\nAfter Whitaker's appointment, Schumer called for Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation and said he would seek to tie a measure protecting Mueller to must-pass legislation if he refuses to do so.\n\nSenators file lawsuit\n\nWhitaker's past public statements have included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump's family finances. In a talk radio interview he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nOn Monday, three other Senate Democrats \u2014 Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island \u2014 filed a lawsuit arguing that Whitaker's appointment was unconstitutional because he has not been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe Justice Department issued a statement Monday defending Whitaker's appointment as \"lawful.\"\n\nIn addition to the criticisms about potential conflict of interest and lack of Senate confirmation, others have argued it goes against the line of succession for filling vacancies.\n\nAlberto Gonzalez told CBC News the line of succession within the Justice Department usually does not include a chief of staff, what he deemed a \"very odd\" choice to fill the role of top law enforcement officials.\n\n\"I think if you were to ask anyone with DOJ experience they would say 'Huh? Why choose this person?'\" said Gonzalez, a former attorney general in the Republican administration of George W. Bush.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on Schumer's request on Tuesday."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Trial of auto shop owner charged in mechanic's death continues", "description": "Elie Hoyeck is the first Nova Scotian to be prosecuted under the so-called Westray law.

He is the first Nova Scotian prosecuted under the so-called Westray law, a Criminal Code amendment aimed at making it easier to hold employers accountable for deaths or injuries in the workplace.\n\nIn opening statements Tuesday, the Crown said Hoyeck was responsible for the death because he failed to adequately provide for Kempton's safety. Hoyeck has pleaded not guilty and is being tried by a judge and jury.\n\nPeter Kempton was a licensed mechanic at Your Mechanic Auto Corner when he died in September 2013.

He told a Halifax courtroom that he worked there for two years and received no formal training from Hoyeck, and doesn't believe any other employees did either.\n\n\"It was a mess,\" he said of the business. \"Vehicles every which way, boats every which way, parts all over the place, almost like a maze.\"\n\nThat day, Spence said Hoyeck told him to remove the battery, oil and tires from an old minivan. He said Kempton was told to remove the catalytic converter and gas tank using an acetylene torch.\n\nSpence said he was standing close by when Hoyeck gave the instructions and that Hoyeck did not say to bleed the gas line or look for hazards before using the torch.\n\n'It just blew up'\n\nSpence said what sticks out to him is that Kempton did not want to get underneath the minivan. Spence said he suggested to Kempton that he just reach under the vehicle with his arm so he'd have \"room to flee\" if something went wrong. However, Kempton did get under the vehicle.\n\n\"From that point it just seemed that everything went really quick,\" Spence testified. \"It just ignited. It just blew up.\"\n\nSpence said he ran into the garage to grab a fire extinguisher, but when he went to use it no fire suppressant came out. He grabbed two or three extinguishers, but \"nothing worked.\"\n\nAs Spence ran next door to call 911, he screamed at Hoyeck to call 911. Spence said he was put on hold, then ran back to the garage where he heard Kempton's screams.\n\nThe heat of the fire prevented him from getting close to Kempton. He said he didn't see Hoyeck nearby.\n\nSpence said he grabbed a raincoat and tried to beat out the flames on Kempton. He said Hoyeck came up and the two of them picked up Kempton.\n\n\"He was declothed but still had his boots on,\" Spence testified. He covered Kempton, whose skin was peeling, with the shirt off his back.\n\nHospital visit\n\nKempton was conscious and asked for water. Spence got a garden hose. As a crowd gathered around, Spence shouted for help and a nurse stepped forward.\n\nAs the ambulance arrived, Spence asked Kempton if there was anything he could do for him. Kempton asked that Spence contact his daughters.\n\nSpence followed the ambulance to hospital but wasn't given any information since he wasn't family. The next day he returned to check on Kempton and bring him a card and a coffee, but hospital staff told him there was no one by the name of Peter there so he went home.\n\nWhen it was Hoyeck's lawyer's turn to question Spence, he pointed out Spence had a criminal record and a history of drug use. One of the convictions was for public mischief for lying to police.\n\nCBC's Blair Rhodes live blogged from the courtroom."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "Angela Merkel defends UN migration pact, rejects 'nationalism in its purest form'", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended a United Nations agreement on migration in a passionate speech to parliament on Wednesday, accusing its opponents of \"nationalism in its purest form.\"", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/merkel-bundestag-un-migration-1.4914192", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4914216.1542805067!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/germany-budget.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:12:53Z", "content": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended a United Nations agreement on migration in a passionate speech to parliament on Wednesday, accusing its opponents of \"nationalism in its purest form.\" The UN pact, to regulate the treatment of migrants worldwide, was a\u2026 [+4118 chars]", "fulltext": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended a United Nations agreement on migration in a passionate speech to parliament on Wednesday, accusing its opponents of \"nationalism in its purest form.\"\n\nThe UN pact, to regulate the treatment of migrants worldwide, was approved in July by all 193 member states except the United States and is to be signed in Morocco next month.\n\nBut Australia on Wednesday said it would not sign up to the pact, joining nations including Israel, Hungary and Austria who have said it would compromise immigration policy.\n\nIn an appeal to embrace a multilateral approach to the migrant issue, Merkel made a thinly veiled attack on U.S. President Donald Trump and her far-right opponents at home.\n\n\"There are people who say they can solve everything themselves and don't have to think about anyone else, that is nationalism in its purest form,\" she told the Bundestag lower house of parliament in an unusually passionate address.\n\nMerkel, whose 13-year chancellorship has been marked by her open-door migrant policy, said the UN pact was in Germany's interests and would not infringe on national sovereignty.\n\nThe Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is a framework for co-operation and aims to reduce illegal migration, help integrate migrants and return them to their home countries.

There are no simple solutions here. And shock therapy with massive immediate changes is not the way to go.\n\nRather, Alberta must consider more gradual approaches.\n\nSpending restraint \u2014 even aggressive restraint \u2014 is not enough on its own. Consider if we restricted spending to rise only with inflation and population growth. This in itself is a tall order, but would solve only about half the long-run challenge.\n\nAnd so, we must slow the growth rate of government spending (especially in health), and introduce modest new taxes. Yes, I'm talking about a sales tax.\n\nAt the same time, instead of either cancelling the carbon tax, as the opposition proposes, or spending its proceeds, as the government is, we could put the revenue toward the deficit.\n\nOf course, other options are available.\n\nWe could and perhaps should seek higher federal transfers \u2014 something other provinces would echo. And we should conduct a detailed review of our health-care spending and cut what can be cut.\n\nMost if not all of the above will cause anger, resentment and pain. But the time has come to have an honest conversation about where our money comes from today, where it will come from tomorrow, and how best it should be spent.\n\nThe right thing to do\n\nThere are many paths forward. All involve trade-offs. To ensure we make the best decisions possible, long-term planning is necessary.\n\nTo quote the former Auditor General Merwan Saber's final report: \"considering the impact of today's decisions on future generations of Albertans is not just important but without question the right thing to do.\"\n\nHe goes on to note that \"risks and opportunities are likely to be missed in absence of putting pen to paper and projecting a fiscal path.\"\n\nAlberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci delivers the provincial budget in Edmonton in March 2018. (Jason Franson/The Canadian Press)\n\nSo let's put pen to paper. Let's recognize and prepare for the long-run challenges ahead.\n\nGovernment \u2014 any government \u2014 should lead the way with regular analysis and clear, consistent goals. Forecasts shouldn't be aspirational, but rather be an honest, hard headed reflection of our fiscal reality.\n\nIn turn, we Albertans must understand challenges ahead, be open to them, and be aware that at this point only painful options are available.\n\nWe did little long-term planning when times were good.

This in itself is a tall order, but would solve only about half the long-run challenge.\n\nAnd so, we must slow the growth rate of government spending (especially in health), and introduce modest new taxes. Yes, I'm talking about a sales tax.\n\nAt the same time, instead of either cancelling the carbon tax, as the opposition proposes, or spending its proceeds, as the government is, we could put the revenue toward the deficit.\n\nOf course, other options are available.\n\nWe could and perhaps should seek higher federal transfers \u2014 something other provinces would echo. And we should conduct a detailed review of our health-care spending and cut what can be cut.\n\nMost if not all of the above will cause anger, resentment and pain. But the time has come to have an honest conversation about where our money comes from today, where it will come from tomorrow, and how best it should be spent.\n\nThe right thing to do\n\nThere are many paths forward. All involve trade-offs. To ensure we make the best decisions possible, long-term planning is necessary.\n\nTo quote the former Auditor General Merwan Saber's final report: \"considering the impact of today's decisions on future generations of Albertans is not just important but without question the right thing to do.\"\n\nHe goes on to note that \"risks and opportunities are likely to be missed in absence of putting pen to paper and projecting a fiscal path.\"\n\nAlberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci delivers the provincial budget in Edmonton in March 2018. (Jason Franson/The Canadian Press)\n\nSo let's put pen to paper. Let's recognize and prepare for the long-run challenges ahead.\n\nGovernment \u2014 any government \u2014 should lead the way with regular analysis and clear, consistent goals. Forecasts shouldn't be aspirational, but rather be an honest, hard headed reflection of our fiscal reality.\n\nIn turn, we Albertans must understand challenges ahead, be open to them, and be aware that at this point only painful options are available.\n\nWe did little long-term planning when times were good. We did little when times were bad.\n\nIt's time we do something different.\n\nThis column is an opinion.

To get a sense of just how expansive their collection is, they have 16 bins of Bach CDs alone, and 13 of Beethoven. They also have an impressive jazz collection.\n\nThe shop wasn't only a place to buy records; it was also a focal point for the classical community, and in addition to the many regulars, Sikora's drew classical-loving travelers from around the world, as well as artists from Ben Heppner to Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin to Elton John.\n\nThe weekend after the owners broke the news, they hit new sales records. (Facebook)\n\nBut in today's music landscape, online monoliths such as Spotify and Amazon rule, and now even the small independent retailers who have managed to stay afloat through two decades of change are vanishing.\n\nCo-owner Ed Savenye became a clerk at the store 20 years ago, and worked his way up to manager and eventually joint owner. He's deeply saddened by the closure, but is also feeling a certain level of frustration.\n\n\"I'm feeling a sense of loss, sadness, and from a personal point of view, maybe some relief because the work is done \u2014 but also a touch of anger. I'll be honest about that,\" says Savenye in a telephone interview with q.\n\n\"Customers have every right to choose how and where and when you shop. We accept it. That's the reality of things. But the downside of that reality is that for a couple of bucks here, a couple of bucks there, and sometimes even spending more than they would have spent here, they decided to shopping online was more convenient. And so there has been a real sense of abandonment there.\"\n\nSavenye put the sentiment even more bluntly in an interview with CBC News: \"For the sake of a couple of bucks, they deserted us.\"\n\nIn a Facebook announcement, Savenye blamed what he calls \"the five dirty D's\": digitization (downloading and streaming), downsizing (people no longer have room for record collections), distribution (getting access to imports is increasingly challenging), desertion (people leaving for Amazon and other online sellers), and the saddest, demise \u2014 that is, the deaths of classical music lovers who continued to buy CDs and LPs.\n\nSikora's Classical Records opened at 432 West Hastings Street in 1979. It will shut its doors for good Feb. 28, 2019, the date of its 40th anniversary. (Karin Larsen/CBC)\n\n\"Sorry to see this happen. I'm also sorry I haven't shopped there as much as I should have,\" said one commenter on the store's Facebook page, echoing Savenye's sentiment. \"In an era of music shops closing down, it was so great to see you hang on, and a classical specialty store at that!\"\n\n\"Sad thing is I have been avoiding buying CDs as my Vancouver apartment sizes have gotten smaller and smaller... 450 sq ft now,\" added another. \"It's all tied in together.\"\n\nWhat's more, other classical retailers are undercutting each other, adds Savenye, with large online retailers like Britain's Presto Classical selling albums for less than he pays wholesale.\n\nEven though many diehard collectors moved online, Sikora's never followed suit, opting to stick with locals and visitors who came to the store looking for a specific title or simply browsing the seemingly endless bins of records and CDs. To create and administer an online database was simply too onerous, and too costly, say Savenye.\n\n\"We would have invested thousands getting stuff up there, and the first thing that people would have said? 'Oh wow, I'm looking at Sikora's and the album is $19.99, and Amazon is selling it for $13.68. I won't be pointing and clicking on Sikora's.' And we still wouldn't have sold the stuff,\" he explains. \"So what can you do? Independents in any industry will never be able to compete with huge online retailers like that \u2014 whether you're in gardening or shoes or classical records. It's really hopeless.\"\n\nEd Savenye first encountered Sikora's in 1991 as a customer. He became co-owner 10 years later. (Karin Larsen/CBC)\n\nAccording to CBC classical music executive director Denise Ball, the closure marks a great loss, because Sikora's was a place where classical music lovers gathered and learned from the knowledgeable staff.\n\n\"It's the only remaining outlet for people who want to get classical music on an artifact, and as we all know, artifacts are going away,\" said Ball in an interview with CBC News. \"What we are losing is that curatorial oversight, and we are left to Spotify to tell us what to listen to. But Spotify doesn't know anything about classical music.\"\n\nSavenye agrees. He says that everyone knows some classical music, even if it's only through cartoons, movies or TV commercials, and many newbies \u2014 as well as more seasoned classical lovers \u2014 regularly come in looking for recommendations from the expert staff.\n\n\"That will be lost as well. I had a woman come in saying, 'I've tried to buy opera online and all I get is Andrea Bocelli and Charlotte Church,'\" recounts Savenye. \"She said, 'I'm sick and tired of trying to figure out what's opera and what's not and who's a good singer and who's not. What can you do for me?' And I said, 'Oh Decca, Operamania, five CDs for $29.99. That will expose you to everything you really need to know to get started in opera.' She bought that and was completely happy.\"\n\nNow Savenye is breaking the news to other stalwart businesses in the area, as well as to the shop's fiercely loyal customers. Word spread quickly through Vancouver's music community which, ironically, led to a record-breaking level of business over the weekend.\n\n\"I'm only speaking in the time that Roger [Scobie] and I have owned the store, but we set the record for one-day total, and we've had the store since 2001,\" said Savenye. \"So the largest single-day total in effectively 18 years. We blew it out of the water by about 30 percent on Saturday. It was impressive.\"\n\nFor a couple of bucks here, a couple of bucks there, and sometimes even spending more than they would have spent here, they decided to shopping online was more convenient.

I did not kill my father. I did not do this cruel, horrible attack on my father,'\" Gold said.\n\nIt's what Oland told police on July 7, 2011, the day his father's body was discovered, it's what he testified to at his first trial in 2015, and it's what he maintains today, Gold said.\n\nRichard Oland, 69, was found dead in his Saint John office on July 7, 2011.

His bank account was overdrawn and credit maxed out, she said. He was spending more than he earned and his latest monthly loan payment to his father \u2014 worth more than $30 million at the time of his death \u2014 of $1,666.67 had bounced.\n\n\"This was the financial burden carried by Dennis Oland when he went to visit his father,\" Knee said. \"A burden he created by living well beyond his means.\"\n\nShe also painted a picture of a strained relationship between father and son. Oland did not approve of an extramarital affair his father was having with Diana Sedlacek, said Knee.\n\nThe younger Oland had referred to the affair as a \"family concern\" and had asked his father's business associate, Robert McFadden, to talk to him and \"tell him it should stop,\" she said.\n\nKnee noted the brutality of the attack. The victim suffered more than 40 blows to his head, neck and hands, the autopsy showed. No weapon was ever found.\n\n'Crime of passion'\n\n\"This was a crime of passion, way beyond what was required to cause his death,\" said Knee.\n\nThe evidence will show it wasn't a robbery, she said. There was no sign of forced entry and the only thing that went missing from Richard Oland's office was his iPhone, despite there being other items of value, such as his Rolex watch, wallet, the keys to his BMW parked outside and cash.\n\nIt's unclear why the iPhone was taken, said Knee, but during the day, while the victim was working, his phone connected with an uptown cell tower near his office.\n\nWould even a professional killer be so calm and normal after such a brutal, bloody, bashing murder? - Alan Gold, defence lawyer\n\nAt 6:44 p.m. \u2014 approximately eight minutes after Dennis Oland told police he had left his father's office and headed home to Rothesay \u2014 the victim's missing iPhone pinged off a cell tower in that community when his mistress sent him a text message.\n\nThe tower was located near the wharf where Oland told police he had stopped to see if his children were there swimming. That text was the last message the missing iPhone received.\n\nA radio frequency engineer will testify cellular devices usually connect with the tower that provides the strongest signal, which, as a general rule, is the closest one, said Knee.\n\nBlood, DNA on jacket\n\nThe blood stains on Dennis Oland's jacket were '\"miniscule,' the defence said, contrasting them with graphic photos of the bloody crime scene. (Court exhibit)\n\nOland told police he was wearing a navy blazer when he visited his father. But his father's secretary said he was wearing a brown sports jacket, confirmed by video surveillance of him earlier in the day.\n\nThe brown jacket was taken to the dry cleaners the following morning and still had the tag attached when it was seized from his home by police on July 14, 2011, during the execution of a search warrant.\n\nForensic testing found four areas of blood on the jacket and the DNA found in each of those areas matched the profile of Richard Oland, said Knee.\n\nOland's lawyer described those blood stains as \"miniscule,\" and \"barely visible to the human eye.\" By contrast, the crime scene was extremely bloody with spatter radiating 360 degrees around Richard Oland's body for a considerable distance, said Gold, putting a photo montage of the crime scene and the jacket on large screen for the courtroom.\n\n\"The Crown has to convince you that jacket was worn by a killer doing that bludgeoning, creating that scene, and that's how [the] jacket looked afterward,\" he told the judge.\n\nThere was no evidence of any cleanup at the scene, yet no blood was found on Oland's shirt, pants, shoes, or in his car or on the cellphone he used to call his wife after he left the office, said Gold.\n\nAlan Gold gave an opening statement on behalf of Dennis Oland's defence team on Wednesday. (CBC)\n\nHe noted the forensic testing cannot age the bloodstains on the jacket or indicate how they originated. They could have predated the murder, he argued, suggesting they were the result of \"innocent transfer.\"\n\nHaving the jacket dry cleaned was consistent with Oland needing clothing for his father's upcoming visitation and funeral, Gold said.\n\nNo bloodstains were pointed out to the dry cleaners, none were noticed and no bloodstain remover was used. The jacket still had the dry cleaning tag attached to it when it was seized by police and the receipt was nearby, he said, suggesting that was inconsistent with Oland being the killer.\n\nCase is circumstantial 'jigsaw puzzle'\n\nHe argued the Crown's case is a circumstantial one, which he compared to a jigsaw puzzle\n\n\"With circumstantial evidence all the pieces have to fit the Crown's puzzle and not another, reasonable puzzle,\" he said. \"It's not whether you can see a picture or think you know what the puzzle will show once some of the pieces are put together, it's that all the pieces fit.\"\n\nHe showed the court security video footage of Oland and his wife shopping in Rothesay and chatting with his aunt \u2014 \"what appears to be casual, good-natured banter\" with the victim's sister \u2014 around 7:40 p.m., just an hour after the murder, according to the Crown's theory.\n\n\"Would even a professional killer be so calm and normal after such a brutal, bloody, bashing murder?\" Gold asked.\n\nIn addition, two witnesses told police they heard thumping noises coming from the victim's office around 8 p.m. \u2014 when Oland was about a 20-minute drive away.\n\n\"Could these sounds have been anything other than the horrible beating of Richard Oland?\"\n\nOn mobile? Follow the live blog here\n\nThe legal burden of proof is on the Crown to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, Gold stressed.\n\n\"It is only through a rigorous application of the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence that the proper questions can be identified and answered without risking a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nMaureen Adamson, Richard Oland's secretary, testified Wednesday that when she left work on July 6, 2011, around 5:45 p.m., her boss and his son were alone together. (CBC)\n\nThe court heard from the Crown's first witness, the victim's secretary, Maureen Adamson, who discovered his body in his second-storey office on Canterbury Street.\n\nShe described being struck by a \"vile odour\" and seeing legs splayed on the floor before she rushed back out to get help.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to resume Thursday at 9:30 a.m. AT with continued testimony from Adamson.\n\nJustice Terrence Morrison is presiding over the new trial without a jury after he dismissed the 16 jurors chosen for the initial retrial on Tuesday over concerns the jury selection was tainted.\n\nAfter jury selection last month, it was discovered that a Saint John police officer who sat with the Crown during jury selection had screened potential jurors using a police force database that shows any interactions people have had with city police.\n\nThat could be seen as \"juror shopping,\" Oland's legal team argued, and call into question the jury's eventual verdict.\n\nMorrison agreed and granted the defence's request for a mistrial.\n\nThe retrial is scheduled to last four months."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Helen Pike", "title": "Alberta law will compel unwed parents to share financial burden of disabled adult children", "description": "Ex-common-law parents caring for their adult children with disabilities won't have to face the financial burden alone anymore.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-family-law-children-disabilities-adult-dependents-new-law-1.4913898", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4195299.1499455690!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/christina-ryan-emily.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:00:00Z", "content": "Ex-common-law parents caring for their adult children with disabilities won't have to face the financial burden alone anymore.

She's emotional and overjoyed that the rules are final set to change after a gruelling year.\n\n\"It's an amazing feeling, it vindicated everything that we have been through,\" she said.\n\nRyan was living with Emily's father for more than 10 years. They never married and split when their daughter was two-years-old.\n\nShe argued that if they had been married, there wouldn't be an issue, saying the province's current laws are unfair and unreasonable.\n\nCurrent law violates rights\n\nIn B.C., Saskatchewan and Manitoba the law already treated divorced couples and separated common-law partners equally, giving both the right to continued financial support after their child reaches adulthood.\n\nAnd last year, Ontario's law was challenged by a single mother of a 22-year-old disabled man. Justice William Sullivan ruled in favour of the woman stating that the Ontario law violated both the mother's and son's equality rights under section 15(1) of the charter.\n\nRyan's case also went forward with a charter challenge in 2017, and her court case was heard in Alberta. A judge ruled, like in Ontario, that the current law was violating both Ryan's and Emily's charter rights.\n\n\"Yes it's unconstitutional. And yes we should change it for those legal reasons, but I think there's also an impetus on us to change it because it is unfair,\" said Ganley.\n\nRyan's lawyer Janet Russell said while this doesn't guarantee that all disabled adults are eligible for continued financial support through their parents, it does bring common-law partners under the same rules that divorced parents face.\n\n\"This is wonderful because this means that there's equality for everyone, regardless of your disability or if your parents were married or not married,\" she said.\n\n\"This is a legacy that my daughter is leaving behind her.\"\n\nRyan gets emotional when she talks about the difference her and her daughter's stories have made in the province.\n\n\"It's so important because my daughter is nonverbal \u2014 and for her to be able to change legislation is remarkable.

Take a look at provincial class-size data in the interactive charts below\n\nAt the Calgary Catholic School District, the numbers are similar, with 63 per cent of classes exceeding the guidelines in the last academic year, up from 53 per cent a decade ago.\n\nJanet Hawkins, a Calgary mom, says her daughter is struggling to learn at school because her Grade 3 class is overcrowded with 28 students. She had about 30 classmates in each of the previous two years, despite the fact that the guidelines call for a maximum of 17 students per class in kindergarten to Grade 3.\n\n\"With so many kids in the class, they get so little face time with the teachers,\" Hawkins said.\n\nThe mom said she and her husband hired tutors for both their daughters \u2014 their eldest is in Grade 6 \u2014 and spend hours each day going over workbooks to ensure they're getting the help they need.\n\n\"It's a huge amount of work for even just learning the basics,\" Hawkins said. \"It's just not happening in the classroom.\"\n\nA closer look at the data\n\nThe CBC News analysis, based on a massive swath of class-size data from Alberta Education, shows Calgary's two largest school authorities have among the highest proportion of overcrowded classrooms in the province.\n\nThe analysis isn't perfect, because blended classrooms that may have three grades in a single room are counted once. But it shows Calgary teachers are contending with greater workloads and, in many cases, have a dozen more students than what's recommended\n\nSo, how do Calgary classrooms stack up, exactly?\n\nBelow is an interactive chart including data for all the schools within both the CBE and CCSD. You can click or tap on the drop-down menu to look at data for each school.\n\n(Can't see the chart?

Again, it includes schools in both the CBE and CCSD.\n\nGreen dots indicate schools with 50 per cent or fewer classes exceeding the class-size targets. Yellow are those with 50 to 75 per cent exceeding the targets. And red indicates schools with more than 75 per cent of classes above the target levels.\n\n(Can't see the map? Click here for a version that should work on your mobile device.)\n\nSchool board officials say class sizes are only one factor they consider when weighing the quality of education, however.\n\nThey say the provincial data fails to account for additional staff in schools, such as educational assistants and speech language aides.\n\n\"It's about meeting the individual needs of those students and what works best with the resources that we have to make sure that we meet all of those needs,\" said CCSD board chair Cheryl Low.\n\n\"It's best reflected in the results.\u2026 We consistently see high academic performance in our district.\"\n\nWhere the guidelines come from\n\nThe provincial government adopted its class size guidelines from a 2003 report by Alberta's Commission on Learning.\n\nAside from calling for a maximum of 17 students in kindergarten to Grade 3, it also recommended class sizes of no more than 23 students in Grades 4 to 6, 25 students in junior high and 27 in high school.\n\nThe report's authors drew a link between smaller classes and better academic results, but they stressed that having engaged students and well-prepared teachers is also critical.\n\nThey based their guidelines on studies, such as international standardized test reports that tracked student scores against class sizes, though they noted the research wasn't perfect.\n\nThe province followed the commission's recommendation not to set legislated limits on class sizes, but to allow some flexibility. The goal was for school boards to meet the guidelines on average, which meant not every class would meet them.\n\nBillions spent\n\nTo reach these goals, the government transferred more than $2.7 billion to school districts since 2004 to hire more teachers, according a report from the auditor general earlier this year.\n\nDespite all this expense, fewer school boards met the guidelines last year than when the funding program started.\n\nThe report found the province hasn't had a plan to achieve its targets for more than a decade. It also criticized using class averages as the target, noting it \"obscures\" the number of classes that fail to meet the guidelines.\n\nThe interactive chart below shows how class sizes looked across all school authorities last year, compared to a decade ago.\n\n(Can't see the map? Click here for a version that should work on your mobile device.)\n\nThe Calgary Board of Education said it spends all of the $51 million it receives each year from the class-size fund to hire teachers in kindergarten to Grade 3, given those students are learning critical skills, such as reading and writing.\n\nStill, the CBE continues to fall short of the guidelines.\n\nThe provincial data shows 88 per cent of the school board's kindergarten-to-Grade 3 classes are too big. A dozen or so schools have classes in this age range with at least 27 students \u2014 10 more than what's recommended.\n\n\"I believe that is primarily due to the fact that the costs of providing public education have exceeded the rate at which overall funding has flown into public education in Alberta,\" said Brad Grundy, the CBE's chief financial officer.\n\nEducation Minister David Eggen could not be reached for an interview. Instead, the province issued a written statement saying it's taken steps to address the problem, such as requiring school boards to show where they're spending the class size funding, a requirement that was scrapped about nine years ago.\n\n'Class sizes have gotten worse'\n\nThe province has also built 31 new schools in Calgary since 2014, with eight more on the way.\n\n\"While we recognize there's clearly more to do, we're pleased that \u2014 on average \u2014 kids in Alberta continue to learn in reasonably small classrooms,\" the government said in its statement.\n\nThe average kindergarten-to-Grade 3 classroom had just over 20 students while all other grades had an average of fewer than 24 students, according to the statement.\n\n(Can't see the map? Click here for a version that should work on your mobile device.)\n\nThe CBC News analysis shows, however, that looking at the total number of classes province-wide, 57 per cent of them fail to meet the guidelines. And about 81 per cent of kindergarten-to-Grade 3 classes fall short of the standard.\n\nBarbara Silva, with Support our Students Alberta, said the numbers come as no surprise and show Alberta governments have long failed to address bulging classrooms.\n\n\"The daily lived realities of Alberta children in Alberta public schools has not changed, not just in four years, but in decades,\" Silva said.\n\n\"Class sizes have gotten worse.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Amy Hadley", "title": "Ontario wolves to be trapped, transferred in effort to restore population on Michigan island", "description": "Wolves from Ontario will soon be moved across the border to try to help restore the dwindling population in Michigan's Isle Royale National Park.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/ontario-wolves-isle-royale-1.4913527", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4847490.1538505763!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/isle-royale-wolves.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T12:30:00Z", "content": "Wolves from Ontario will soon be moved across the border to try to help restore the dwindling population in Michigan's Isle Royale National Park.

That plan has now been given the green light, said park superintendent Phyllis Green.\n\n\"Actually we were fortunate that Michigan's Governor [Rick] Snyder had a conversation with [Ontario's] Premier [Doug] Ford and talked about the importance of the project,\" she said.\n\n\"And so after that conversation we were able to have further conversations and we're definitely going to be \u2014 weather providing \u2014 receiving wolves from Ontario this winter.\"\n\nThe wolves will come from Michipicoten Island in northeastern Lake Superior, where a very different wildlife management problem has made headlines.

(National Park Service/John Pepin)\n\n'Robust' Canadian wolves desirable for genetic strength\n\nThe Ontario wolves are desirable for several reasons, said Green, including the fact that the animals on Michipicoten are well-studied by Ontario researchers who will be able to identify alpha males and females that might be well suited to the trip.\n\n\"And also we actually know that they're actually pretty prolific on pups, and that's certainly what you would hope to see when you start a new population.\"\n\n\"And the other positive is that they're very robust genetically,\" Green added.\n\n\"On the U.S. side, we've had situations where the wolf population has dropped and then there's some incursion of coyote or dog genetics into the population.\"\n\nA trail camera photo shows one of the female wolves transferred to Michigan's Isle Royale National Park this fall, as part of a multi-year effort to restore the population and balance the ecosystem. (U.S. National Park Service)\n\nTwo wolf fatalities so far\n\nThe wolf transfer is not without risks. During the first phase of the project this fall, a wolf that had been cleared for transfer died before it could be moved to Isle Royale, prompting changes to protocols in an effort to reduce stress on the animals.\n\nOne male and three females were successfully moved to the island, but in November, the National Park Service confirmed that the male wolf had been found dead. The cause of death is not known, Green said, but necropsy results expected in December should yield more information.\n\nSome natural mortality is to be expected, Green said.\n\n\"It's unfortunate but in the wild population about 25 to 30 per cent of the wolves die annually,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a tough life out there for them.\"\n\nThe transferred wolves are being monitored using GPS technology and the other three are doing well, Green said.\n\nThe Isle Royale wolf relocation effort is expected to take three to five years, with the eventual goal of moving up to 30 animals."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Canadian Press", "title": "Drunk driver who killed 3 siblings, grandfather lacks insight into drinking issues: parole board", "description": "A drunk driver who killed three children and their grandfather revealed a lack of insight into his drinking habits and the risk they pose to others, the Parole Board of Canada said Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/marco-muzzo-parole-board-ruling-1.4914174", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4878006.1540484052!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/vaughan-fatal-accident-lawsuit-20160920.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T12:21:32Z", "content": "In trying to paint himself as a responsible drinker who made a deadly mistake, a drunk driver who killed three children and their grandfather revealed a lack of insight into his drinking habits and the risk they pose to others, the Parole Board of Canada said\u2026 [+3913 chars]", "fulltext": "In trying to paint himself as a responsible drinker who made a deadly mistake, a drunk driver who killed three children and their grandfather revealed a lack of insight into his drinking habits and the risk they pose to others, the Parole Board of Canada said Tuesday.\n\nIn a document laying out its reasons for denying Marco Muzzo day and full parole earlier this month, the board said the 32-year-old's reluctance to acknowledge a history of binge drinking and his admission that he does not know what contributed to his alcohol misuse raised red flags.\n\n\"You have maintained from the very outset that you are not addicted to alcohol and while this may be true, your continued rigidity and lack of insight as to what that definition may mean has prevented you from recognizing that an actual problem exists,\" the board wrote.\n\n\"During the hearing, for the first time since you were arrested, you outlined a significant history of binge drinking and this, coupled with your lack of understanding on the issue of impairment, leads the board to conclude your risk remains undue.\"\n\nMuzzo pleaded guilty in 2016 to four counts of impaired driving causing death and two of impaired driving causing bodily harm and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nThe collision in Vaughan, Ont., claimed the lives of nine-year-old Daniel Neville-Lake, his five-year-old brother Harrison, their two-year-old sister Milly and the children's 65-year-old grandfather, Gary Neville. The children's grandmother and great-grandmother were also seriously injured.\n\nThe case continues to capture widespread attention, with thousands signing a petition to oppose Muzzo's potential release.\n\nEarlier drunken incident revealed\n\nMuzzo's parole hearing in early November took place at the Beaver Creek Institution in Gravenhurst, Ont., where he is held as a minimum security offender. He has a two-month window to appeal the ruling or he must wait a year to reapply for parole.\n\nAt the hearing, the board pressed Muzzo on an incident that took place in 2012, three years before the fatal crash, but that did not come to light during his court proceedings. Nor was it brought to the attention of his case management team until weeks before the hearing.\n\nIn that incident, Muzzo and a friend became belligerent and threatening after being barred from a strip club, then tried to kick out the windows of a police cruiser after his arrest. The parole board heard he was charged with public intoxication and held until he sobered up.\n\nWhile Muzzo initially said he had forgotten the incident, in fact, he was \"hoping that the incident would never be discussed,\" the board wrote in its decision.\n\n\"It would seem you were trying to trying to present yourself as a modest and responsible drinker who had simply made a terrible mistake on the day of the fatal collision,\" it said.\n\n\"In the board's view, you intentionally failed to disclose key information as you were hoping to paint yourself in a better light. In reality, you were simply impeding the progress you might have otherwise made.\"\n\n'You continue to minimize the severity'\n\nThe crash took place in September 2015 after Muzzo returned from a trip to Florida for his bachelor party. His group had travelled on a private plane and Muzzo said at the hearing he had up to four drinks during the flight and had been drinking until 3 a.m. the night before.\n\nHe picked up his car at Toronto's Pearson International Airport and drove through a stop sign while speeding, T-boning the minivan carrying the Neville-Lake family, his court case heard.\n\nMuzzo initially insisted during the hearing that he did not feel impaired at the time but later acknowledged that he should have known better. The board said in its decision he still did not appear to recognize how drunk he was.\n\n\"While you now accept you were impaired at the time of the collision, you continue to minimize the severity by indicating that many of your behaviours and responses were the result of shock as much as they were due to alcohol consumption,\" it wrote.\n\nThe Neville-Lake family has said it questions Muzzo's remorse in light of his statements and the fact that he sought parole at the first opportunity."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Colleen Underwood", "title": "Calgary's 1st female police chief says same problems plague force 23 years later", "description": "Retired police chief Christine Silverberg says when she walked onto the job in July 1995, she was handed a service in turmoil.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/christine-silverberg-calgary-police-1.4914068", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4914076.1542771921!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/christine-silverberg.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T12:15:00Z", "content": "Retired police chief Christine Silverberg said when she walked into the job in October 1995, she took over a service in turmoil with leadership problems, disenfranchisement and diversity issues.

forward\u2026\n\nSilverberg, a native Ontarian, was appointed Calgary's police chief in 1995, serving for five years until 2000 when she stepped down to pursue a law career.\n\nShe made history when she became the first woman in the country to head a major city police force.\n\nShe said as she went through her policing career in the '70s and '80s, and saw issues around discrimination and the way police interacted with their communities, she knew she wanted to rise to a position of power where she could affect change.\n\nWhen she took the top policing job in Calgary, she said it wasn't easy being that agent of change, remembering the time someone drew a pink outline of a body outside police headquarters.\n\nShe was also the target of threats.\n\nFormer police chief Christine Silverberg speaks to CBC in 1997:\n\nCalgary police force names its first female chief. 3:53\n\nBut she stood determined to push through the pushback.\n\nShe got rid of the superintendent level, to minimize the clutter, as she saw it, within the ranks.\n\nShe put a direct phone line in her office to give officers, or anyone within the service, direct access her if they needed to talk confidentially.\n\nAnd she put a civilian in charge of CPS' professional standards section, which is responsible for investigating police complaints and misconduct.\n\nShe said she also spent a lot of time listening to everyone within the service, from the mechanic at the shop to the highest ranked officers when she first stepped into the role, to learn their perceptions of the systemic problems and potential solutions.\n\nShe even relied on front-line members to tackle organizational problems, such as the way promotions were handled.\n\n\"So that you couldn't then say I wasn't consulted or the voice of the frontline isn't being heard or all of these things because they were the ones developing it.\"\n\nYet, she said, for all the advances she might have made, she is concerned to see the service still dealing with many of the same issues.\n\nNo debrief with former chiefs\n\nThe head of the police commission's search committee for a new chief, Richard Sigurdson, disagrees that there's been a lack of continuity with successive chiefs.\n\n\"I don't think things change on a 360 every time a new police chief comes in, there will be some continuity,\" said Sigurdson.\n\nHe said the commission helped design CPS' HR reforms and established the policies around community policing in consultation with the senior leadership team within the service.\n\nSo they will inform the incoming chief about the current priorities.\n\nIn recent weeks, the commission has been asking for input from Calgarians, through an online survey, officers, both in person and in a recent employee survey, as well as from the police association and city council.\n\nThat feedback is being used to determine the next chief's position profile, or job description, which will be posted this week.\n\n\"We're making no bones about the fact that we have heard from the membership that there is concern about the low level of morale.\"\n\n\"There is a sense among many members that decisions have been made that aren't communicated very effectively and or are not based on what it is the members are saying or in their own best interests.\"\n\nThe commission has also heard the need for someone who can understand where the rank-and-file members are coming from and where the organization as a whole needs to go.\n\nBut Sigurdson said the current search process that began in August has not included one-on-one conversations with the former police chief Roger Chaffin, or any other previous police chiefs.\n\n'Fresh eyes'\n\nSilverberg said that's too bad because she knows those who have sat in that job could pass on some valuable experience based on their successes and failures.\n\nAnd she said it would be especially important given the fact the service is in the midst of implementing HR reforms to address bullying, harassment and morale issues.\n\nShe said her door is always open if the commission or the next chief would like to sit down with her.\n\nAs for whether she would suggest an internal or external candidate take on the next top constable job, she said it's about the best candidate, although she said, it can be tougher for internal candidates to implement sweeping changes.\n\n\"For the very reason that they have been embedded in the system and may have been even put down in the system.\n\n\"So sometimes you need fresh eyes.\"\n\nThe commission has said it remains open to both internal or external candidates."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Matthew Kupfer", "title": "Talk at Dunrobin tornado meeting swirls around winter worries",

We already have a number of companies that I've seen, in their boardrooms, cut their spending for the winter.\"\n\nIt's no wonder then that Premier Rachel Notley is looking for some kind of rapid solution. Finding one? That's something that will test both the industry and her government.\n\nThis week, Notley charged three envoys with the task of working with experts and executives on finding a salve. She's expecting updates every couple of days for the next two to four weeks.\n\nPeter Tertzakian, executive director of ARC Energy Research Institute, says collaboration between all the stakeholders is needed to address Canada's oil price woes. (Monty Kruger/CBC)\n\n\"We're absolutely treating this as a short-term process,\" Notley said Monday.\n\nThe problem is that simple fixes that could staunch the bleeding quickly have proven elusive so far.\n\nMore crude shipments on rail will help, analysts say. Improving efficiency of the pipeline network \u2014 ensuring users don't book space they don't need \u2014 could be another potential tool.\n\nLonger term, it's hoped more pipelines will help, but the closest one to completion is Enbridge's Line 3, which isn't expected to be ready until about this time next year.\n\nSo Notley's envoys will perhaps hope someone is sitting on a clever solution that will please everyone \u2014 and fast.\n\nOf course, they already know one way to address the problem and it's the opposite of an \"easy\" fix.\n\nFor the past few weeks, several oil executives have been urging Notley to impose temporary production cuts on the industry to clear the oil glut and pipeline bottlenecks that have weighed heavily on prices.\n\nThe price of Western Canada Select has been tracking roughly $40 US below the American benchmark price, West Texas Intermediate, for weeks. Typically, it might track $12 to $15 below WTI.\n\nEnbridge workers weld pipe on the Line 3 pipeline project earlier this year. It is the closest major pipeline project to completion but isn't expected to be ready until late next year. (John Woods/Canadian Press)\n\nInitially a problem for heavy oil, the battle for pipeline space is dampening prices for other grades of oil.\n\nMandated cuts is an idea that has the backing of at least two big oilsands players, Cenovus Energy and Canadian Natural Resources, both of which are already pulling back on production.\n\nIt's an extraordinary request from an industry with a reputation for eschewing government intervention.\n\nBut supporters of the output strategy blame political setbacks for the failure to build new pipelines and say government must step in to correct the resultant market failure.\n\nThe oilpatch is not a monolith, however. There are competing interests, goals and strategies.\n\nOn the other side of the debate are Canada's three largest integrated oil producers: Suncor, Imperial Oil and Husky Energy. And they're not interested in hearing about mandatory cuts.\n\n\"The market is working,\" Husky spokeswoman Kim Guttormson said in an email.\n\n\"Pipelines and other transportation solutions are required to clear the market and eliminate bottlenecks, and we believe the best option is to advance pipeline solutions.\n\n\"Market intervention comes with an unacceptably high level of economic and trade risk.\"\n\nCertainly, the government would have to consider what signal it would send to the broader market if it did step in.\n\nSo far, as Tertzakian notes, the debate has largely been a capitalistic one: Does government intervene?\n\nBut there is another party to this issue: the resource owner.\n\nUCP Leader Jason Kenney lauded firms that reduced production voluntarily, saying they have acted \"commendably.\" (The Canadian Press)\n\nThis includes the provinces, their citizens and, more broadly, Canadians, who benefit indirectly through taxation. Billions of dollars are at stake in the form of taxes and royalties.\n\n\"So it requires collaboration between all the stakeholders,\" Tertzakian said. \"Oilsands companies \u2014 and the parties within the oilsands companies that are sort of duking it out \u2014 the non-oilsands companies, the provincial governments and the federal government.\"\n\nSome will ask whether oil companies, and their investors, can be reasonably expected to take one for the good of the team. Building consensus among such a group sounds like a monumental task.\n\nYet, you can add Alberta conservatives to those hoping companies across the sector can be persuaded to make voluntary production cuts.\n\nUCP Leader Jason Kenney lauded firms that reduced production voluntarily, saying they acted \"commendably.\"\n\n\"These efforts should be matched by all producers,\" he wrote in an open letter to Notley on Monday.\n\n\"The resource that they are developing belongs to all Albertans, who have a right to expect that producers will not act in a way that makes Alberta poorer.\"\n\nBut there's no whiff of consensus for such a quick fix and Canada's crude price woes carry on."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Bethany Lindsay", "title": "Grocery store worker denies 'spurious and vindictive' defamation claims from his union", "description": "A Vancouver grocery store employee whose union has accused him of unlawfully breaching a membership database and defaming union leaders says he \"denies each and every allegation.\"", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grocery-store-worker-denies-spurious-and-vindictive-defamation-claims-from-his-union-1.4913849", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4381382.1513196556!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/watchdog-raids-offices-of-grocery-retailers.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T12:00:00Z", "content": "A Vancouver grocery store employee whose union has accused him of unlawfully breaching a membership database and defaming union leaders says he \"denies each and every allegation.\" Jason Buckle filed a response last week to a lawsuit from the United Food and C\u2026 [+2231 chars]", "fulltext": "A Vancouver grocery store employee whose union has accused him of unlawfully breaching a membership database and defaming union leaders says he \"denies each and every allegation.\"\n\nJason Buckle filed a response last week to a lawsuit from the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 1518 (UFCW), vigorously contesting the union's accusations.\n\n\"The allegations against Buckle contained in the notice of claim are wholly unsupported by fact, spurious and vindictive,\" the response says.\n\nBuckle, who works at Urban Fare in Yaletown, says he will be asking for repayment of his legal costs for defending himself.\n\nUFCW filed a lawsuit against Buckle and 10 unnamed John Does in B.C.

The letter came days after police charged Const. Craig Houle for allegedly stealing from other officers and selling their items on Kijiji.\n\nIIU executive director Zane Tessler has raised concerns with the WPS over a series of issues that are hindering the ability of his office to conduct their investigations. (CBC)\n\n\"I am concerned that there may be internal criminal investigations of WPS members that are not brought to the attention of the IIU, as required by law,\" wrote Tessler.\n\n\"This matter needs an immediate and clear resolution.\"\n\nIn another email exchange in the fall of 2016, Tessler wrote to newly appointed police Chief Danny Smyth to express his dismay over learning through local media, including the CBC, that the WPS forwarded a case involving use of force during an arrest to the IIU \u2014 except that never happened, Tessler said.\n\nThe incident involved a man being handcuffed and punched by a Winnipeg police officer during an arrest in the North End. The incident was widely viewed online as it was captured on video by a bystander.\n\n\"The more disconcerting comment attributed to [police spokesperson Const. Rob Carver] was that he confirmed that WPS has reported this incident to the IIU,\" Tessler wrote.\n\n\"If a notification was intended for the IIU, why did it not occur?\" he asked.\n\nIn both cases, it is unclear based on the email chains how the chiefs responded, if at all, to the emails.\n\n'I have pushed back'\n\nSome of the tension between WPS and the police watchdog appear to be the result of differences of opinion over what necessitates IIU involvement based on the wording of the Police Services Act.\n\nIn August 2017, Tessler emailed Smyth after learning an officer was shot in the leg after his gun went off spontaneously and demanded that his team take over the investigation.\n\nChief Danny Smyth says he has pushed back against what he views as the IIU over-stepping their bounds. (Lyzaville Sale/CBC)\n\nChief Smyth responded the next day saying that this had been a serious workplace accident and was therefore reported to Manitoba Workplace Health and Safety instead.\n\nIn an internal memo sent Tuesday to all WPS staff, obtained by CBC News, Smyth explained the incident in question involved the accidental discharge of a police sidearm, which seriously injured an officer.\n\nSmyth also said in the memo he has resisted requests from the IIU when he feels their bounds are being overstepped.\n\n\"Indeed I have pushed back where I believe IIU lacks jurisdiction and is not entitled to copies of files involving our members,\" he wrote.\n\nDefinition of 'police officer'\n\nPart of the chief's concerns involve cases where the IIU sought interviews with civilian members of the police service.\n\nIn a February 2017 email, Tessler sent a notification that he was seeking an interview with a cadet who was considered a witness to an incident.\n\nHowever, Smyth refused to release the cadet to the IIU since he was of the opinion that the agency lacked legislative authority to compel him to testify.\n\n\"Section 1 of the Act define police officers as 'a person appointed to serve as a police officer in a police service \u2026.' Cadets are not police officers, but have peace officer appointments,\" Smyth wrote back.\n\nCadets increasingly perform police-related tasks in Winnipeg. The police chief says they are not police officers and so the IIU has no jurisdiction over them. (CBC)\n\nIn Tuesday's memo circulated to staff, the chief said he encourages legislative amendments to clarify who should fall under the purview of the IIU's mandate.\n\n\"IIU is not entitled to designate non-police officers as either witness or subject officers and I have resisted disclosure in those situations because they have no legislative authority,\" he wrote.\n\nOfficers share notes\n\nUnder IIU regulations, the police chief is responsible for ensuring officers involved in a serious incident are separated as soon as possible and remain separated until IIU investigators have completed their work. The purpose is to avoid situations where officers corroborate and agree on a single version of events.\n\nHowever on at least one occasion, Tessler flagged a case where an officer admitted to discussing an incident with other police on scene.\n\nIn another case, the IIU interviewed a cadet who admitted to having read the notes of the officer being investigated \u2014 that officer declined to meet with the IIU \u2014 and described events that could not have been witnessed since the cadet had already gone home.\n\n\"In the present investigation, this issue should be brought to the attention of the cadet and to your training branch,\" Tessler wrote.\n\n'Growing pains'\n\nThe Winnipeg Police Service declined the opportunity for an interview to discuss the matter. However, in a written statement, the chief said he maintains a positive relationship with the IIU.\n\n\"Civilian director Zane Tessler and I communicate and meet with one another routinely. As with any new protocol, there were what I would characterize as 'growing pains' at the beginning of its mandate,\" Smyth wrote.\n\n\"At times, we have disagreed on the interpretation of regulations as they pertain to officer involved conduct. We have worked through those matters when they arose. The Winnipeg Police Service is committed to ensuring the success of civilian oversight as it pertains to police governance, and more specifically independent investigation of officer involved incidents that fall within the jurisdiction of the IIU as prescribed under the Police Services Act,\" he said.\n\nImprovement to process, laws\n\nMayor Brian Bowman said any opportunity to clarify lines of responsibility would help improve the relationship between the IIU and the WPS.\n\n\"The chief of police and the men and women of the Winnipeg Police Service have my support, in the context of the checks and balances that are, I think, necessary in the administration of justice, and specifically the IIU's efforts. If there are improvements to that process that can involve greater openness and transparency, that's something I think everyone would benefit from,\" Bowman said.\n\nJustice Minister Cliff Cullen, who ultimately oversees the IIU, said his government is in the early stages of reviewing the Police Services Act.\n\n\"That's the intent of reviewing any legislation, to see if there's an avenue to strengthen legislation or see where there's areas that it's weak or flawed, and certainly we'll engage Manitobans,\" he said.\n\nThe IIU was not immediately available to respond to questions provided by the CBC.\n\nWith files from Kristin Annable, Ian Froese\n\n\n\nPrivate email sent from Zane Tessler to Chief Clunis"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Montreal police investigate gunshots in city's east end", "description": "Montreal police are investigating after gunshots were heard in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough at about 10:00 p.m. Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/shooting-mercier-hochelaga-maisonneuve-1.4914142", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4914144.1542796363!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/shots-fired.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:46:01Z", "content": "Montreal police are investigating after gunshots were heard in the Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough at about 10:00 p.m. Tuesday.

Adults haven't stopped innovating.\n\nThe diaper breakdown\n\nDisposable diapers have come a long way since they were first invented in the late 1940s, and the modern-day product is \"actually quite an interesting and complex concoction,\" said Schwarcz.\n\nIts outer layer is typically a plastic \u2014 polypropylene or polyethylene \u2014 while its inner layers often contain an absorbent fibre derived from wood pulp. But the real star of the show, according to Schwarcz, is what's mixed in with that fibre: a polymer called sodium polyacrylate, \"which just has an amazing ability to absorb moisture.\"\n\nBecause of a lack of oxygen, even the fibrous parts of these disposables stand little chance of biodegrading in a landfill. (Lindsay Bird/CBC)\n\nExact formulations of these plastics and polymers are tightly guarded trade secrets in a competitive and lucrative industry, but they share a common fate: once disposables are sent to the landfill, they stay there.\n\n\"In theory, there are biodegradable parts [of diapers],\" said Schwarcz. \"But the fact is that biodegradation takes place only under perfect conditions, not in a landfill.\"\n\nBuilding a better diaper\n\nTo the diaper industry's credit, companies have worked to reduce the amount of non-perishable material they use.\n\nOne study \u2014 conducted by Procter & Gamble, the makers of Pampers, but verified by what they called \"external experts\" \u2014 stated that the company's average American diaper in 2010 weighed 45 per cent less than its 1992 version.\n\nBut that same study found innovation slowed from 2007 onward, saying \"it is hard to make a small diaper smaller.\"\n\nFor all their efforts to reduce their products' environmental footprints, the Pampers study and others concluded the majority of a disposable's environmental footprint comes from its creation rather than its landfill afterlife, as is commonly believed.\n\n\"Used diaper waste causes caregivers concern because they see much of it,\" stated the Pampers study.\n\nDisposables 'a kick in the teeth'\n\nThat's a concern Heather Osmond can relate to.\n\nThe cost savings initially attracted the Corner Brook, N.L., mom and her husband to try cloth diapering their son Nolan, after using disposables when he was born and realizing the legacy that would leave behind.\n\nNolan Osmond wore nothing but cloth diapers from the time he was about 10 weeks to age 3\u00bd. (Submitted by Heather Osmond)\n\n\"My child's diapers would literally be here longer than my great-great-grandchildren,\" said Osmond. \"It was almost a kick in the teeth to realize how long our garbage was going to be sitting around.\"\n\nOsmond threw herself into reusables, using them exclusively until Nolan was fully toilet trained at around 3\u00bd years old.\n\n\"His diapers that started at the very, very beginning with him being 10 weeks old lasted him right up until potty training. That was amazing,\" she said.\n\nCloth pros and cons\n\nOsmond diverted thousands of diapers from landfill.\n\nElsewhere in Canada there are efforts to promote reusables: several Quebec municipalities now offer cloth diaper subsidies, aiming to win over more parents.\n\nBut that doesn't mean cloth is the clear environmental winner overall in the diaper debate.\n\nCotton, the most popular source material for cloth diapers, requires immense amounts of water and chemicals to produce. Schwarcz estimated cotton soaks up 25 per cent of the world's insecticide use despite being grown on just three per cent of its arable land.\n\nThen there is the laundry issue. It can take a lot to get a cloth diaper clean \u2014 hot water cycles, sometimes in duplicate for the heaviest soiled loads \u2014 not to mention the amount of time the absorbent pads require in a dryer.\n\nHow caregivers clean their cloth diapers can make the difference to its environmental impact. (Nati Harnik/Associated Press)\n\nOne exhaustive study by the British government considered all those concerns and concluded that disposables diapers (or nappies, in British parlance) beat out cloth by a hair.\n\nBut that conclusion comes with a big asterisk.\n\n\"It is consumers' behaviour after purchase that determines most of the impacts from reusable nappies,\" the study stated, adding cloth can trump disposables if they are washed in water temperature at 60 C or less, are air dried and are used on a second child.\n\nSchwarcz said by laundering mindfully, cloth beats disposable, \"but it's not a landslide victory.\"\n\n\"If I were to put all of this together, my answer would be to use the cloth at home and disposables when travelling.\"\n\nCompost and recycling\n\nBut there is another way, one Schwarcz sees as better suited to the hygienic standards required in daycare centres and nursing homes: recycling disposables.\n\nThe industry is in its infancy in Canada, but the City of Toronto has been turning parts of disposable diapers into compost since 2002.\n\nDirty disposables are collected curbside with other organic waste and brought to a processing facility, where all the organics are put into \"basically a giant washing machine,\" said Nadine Kerr, a manager with the city's solid waste management services.\n\nThat washing machine separates plastics from organics; the plastics float to the top and are raked off then sent to landfill, while the organic materials \u2014 including baby poop \u2014 are sent on to anaerobic digesters, which create compost.\n\nTorontonians compost 12,000 tonnes diapers and sanitary products each year through the city's green bin service. (Getty Images)\n\nEach year, the city's facilities \u2014 which Kerr confirmed \"definitely\" smell inside \u2014 process 12,000 tonnes of baby and adult diapers, along with used menstrual products.\n\n\"The idea was to get as much diverted from landfill as we could,\" said Kerr.\n\nToronto may be doing more with disposables than most other Canadian municipalities \u2014 although check out these Calgary dads offering a similar service \u2014 but some overseas innovators are taking it a notch further.\n\nPrivate companies in the U.K., like Knowaste and NappiCycle, now recycle all parts of disposables, even the plastics.\n\n\"Certainly it's doable,\" said Schwarcz. \"The question is whether or not it is economically feasible.\"\n\nBut as Canadian demographics continue to skew older, Schwarcz said that economic question may soon become moot.\n\n\"There is a driving force for this because, of course the, population is increasing, especially the older population \u2014 and they use a lot of these incontinence products,\" he said.\n\n\"The best thing would be if these recycling facilities become commonplace.\"\n\nJoin the discussion on the CBC Waves of Change Facebook group, or email us: wavesofchange@cbc.ca.\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Pam Berman", "title": "Lawsuit launched after senior dies from alleged prescription error can proceed", "description": "Lawyers for the defendants argued the case should be stopped because it wasn't filed in time under the Pharmacy Act.

Fraser said he is the only gastroenterologist qualified to do it in Atlantic Canada.\n\n\"Basically, we're measuring bowel wall thickness,\" said Fraser. \"We're measuring how thick is the gut, how inflamed is the gut. And that helps us differentiate irritable bowel syndrome from inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n\nA non-invasive approach\n\nWhile it's not appropriate for every patient, Fraser said ultrasound can be a good way to diagnose or rule out inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's, and track the health of patients who have the condition.\n\nGastroenterologists are doctors specially trained in diagnosing and treating diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and liver.\n\nFor Fraser, who first learned about intestinal ultrasounds during his residency at the University of Calgary, a particular draw is that it's non-invasive, allows immediate results and better communication with patients, particularly when compared to more traditional tests such as colonoscopy or CT scans.\n\nIt doesn't replace other tests, but it provides a far more detailed picture than if Fraser were doing a more traditional exam using only his hands on a patient's abdomen.\n\nDr. Hughie Fraser is specially trained to do intestinal ultrasonography. (CBC)\n\n\"I think you're getting a much fuller history while you're examining them,\" he said. \"There's a better connection between the patient and the physician while you're doing this.\"\n\nFraser said the ability for patients to see what's going on inside them in real time and talk with the doctor about what's happening improves patient engagement.\n\n\"In a lot of disease aspects we're trying to bring the patient on board and say, 'Take your disease into control for yourself.'\"\n\nEmily Oickle appreciates all those aspects of the practice.\n\nThe Liverpool resident had a perforation of the bowel during a colonoscopy, which led to surgery to remove part of her bowel. Ultrasound, however, would have shown colonoscopy wasn't a good option for her.\n\nA community steps up\n\nBeing able to have access to the device at her doctor's office during an exam and not have to wait for test results is a big deal, said Oickle.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" she said. \"You just instantly see.\"\n\nGetting the technology to Fraser's office wasn't cheap.\n\nAt $117,000, it's unlikely doctors are going to be rushing out to buy their own ultrasound machine. That's where the community stepped up.\n\nBig picture system benefits\n\nFraser made a pitch to the South Shore Regional Hospital Auxiliary, which fully funded the purchase. The auxiliary's mandate is patient comfort and care, and Sharon Ritcey said the group was immediately swayed by Fraser's presentation.\n\n\"It's the fact that the auxiliary could be a part of something as innovative as this is,\" she said. \"We're very proud to play a part in that.\"\n\nFraser now has his own dedicated ultrasound machine for patients who visit him at his office off hospital grounds in Bridgewater.\n\nBesides what it means for patients, Fraser also sees the effort as a way to help the health-care system.\n\nInterest in training\n\nFinancially, ultrasound is a far cheaper and faster option than the more common tests and procedures he might use. There are educational and potential recruiting benefits, too.\n\nAlready he's getting calls from doctors who would like to do training and, as someone who regularly takes medical residents, Fraser is exposing future gastroenterologists to the technique early in their careers.\n\n\"For them to see this technology and use this technology and have hands-on experience, it really plants the seed with them and piques their interest.\"\n\nRead more articles from CBC Nova Scotia"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Talia Ricci", "title": "How formerly homeless people are helping those in need... and helping themselves", "description": "Ve'ahavta's, a Jewish humanitarian organization, is running meal box program for the homeless that employs people who've experienced poverty themselves.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/north-york-program-delivers-meals-winter-clothing-to-the-homeless-1.4912433", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4912445.1542737189!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ryan.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:00:00Z", "content": "There's something special about preparing and receiving a homemade meal.

But that's what Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz did just as bitcoin was reaching a peak over $18,000 US.\n\n\"There is no intrinsic value for something like bitcoin, so it's not really an asset one can analyze,\" Canada's chief central banker said almost a year ago.\n\n\"It's just essentially speculative or gambling.\"\n\nConjured from thin air\n\n\"You're better off in Vegas; the food is better,\" joked cryptocurrency critic Jeffrey Robinson in his own attack on cryptos, which he insisted were neither investments nor currencies.\n\nThis week, people who once turned their Canadian dollars into bitcoin may be wishing they had listened to Poloz and Robinson as the digital token plunged again to below $5,000 US.\n\nIt may not be hard to see money paid for bitcoin, a relatively recent invention conjured out of ones and zeros, going back to the thin air from whence it came.\n\nDigital currencies are relatively easy to write off as a foolish gamble. But in an era of casino capitalism, the fact is that losing money in Vegas may actually be better for the economy than losing on speculative investments of any kind, whether crypto, stocks or oil.\n\nAfter peaking in late 2017, the price of bitcoin has fallen precipitously since.\n\nAt least the money you lose at the card table or roulette wheel flows out of your pockets straight into someone else's. In casino capitalism, especially when asset values go through a synchronized decline, money can simply disappear from the economy altogether \u2014 not to return until some future day when those asset prices rise again.\n\nSpeaking on U.S. business network CNBC, Robinson, author of BitCon: The Naked Truth About Bitcoin warned that anyone interested in bitcoin should Google the greater fool theory, \"because that's what they are all about.\"\n\nFinding someone more foolish\n\nGreater fool theory is the concept that it may very well be wise to buy an asset that you know is foolishly overvalued, so long as you are confident you can sell it on at a higher price to a greater fool. But that only works if you find that greater fool before asset prices decline.\n\nAnd the concept is by no means limited to cryptocurrencies.\u200b\n\nThe hard fact is that assets with intrinsic value are also subject to the theory, something that occurred to me in a much earlier bitcoin era in 2013 when both gold and bitcoin were falling at around the same time.\n\nJust how long ago that is in bitcoin valuation terms can be seen from the fact that it had just \"plummeted to about $50 after hitting a Wednesday high of about $260.\"\n\nThe Nasdaq had a strong 2018 until a sell-off that started in October. (CBC)\n\nMy conclusion in that case was not exactly original in that there is an ancient maxim in Roman law that says \"Res tantum valet quantum vendi potest\" which translates as \"a good's only value is the amount you can sell it for.\"\n\nLooked at individually, there are rational reasons why someone might want to pay less for bitcoin, stocks and oil.\n\nBitcoin is being investigated for price rigging. In the case of stocks, flat demand for Apple products and some bad financial results from retailers are offered as a reason for the decline. In the case of oil, high inventories are among the factors getting the blame for prices falling to their lowest levels in a year.\n\nThe curse of Harry Potter\n\nBut the fact that they are all happening at the same time may be a sign of something else \u2014 a general and synchronized gloom about assets that is the flip side to the recent excess of euphoria.\n\nLike the slap of a beaver tail, a warning in one market sector can act as signal to traders in other parts of the pond. And despite repeated reminders that the market and the economy are two different things, a widespread loss of asset value from the economy can have an economic impact.\n\nThe bitcoin chart \"looks like the left-hand side of the Eiffel Tower, doesn't it?\" said Poloz a year ago, allowing us to imagine the other side of the tower.\n\nDepending on how you construct your graph, you could have found similar Eiffel towers in various other stocks and markets.\n\nThink back to the happy man with the goatee and the hat who celebrated the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing to 20,000 and through to 25,000 in the months after Donald Trump was elected president.\n\nTrader Peter Tuchman celebrates as stock market heads for a new record in December 2016.

(Lincoln Ho)\n\nWalmart wouldn't detail why the concept didn't take off, except to say that it's currently testing improvements to the technology, including finding ways to let customers use their own phones. In Walmart's case, shoppers had to use an in-store mobile device to scan items.\n\n\"We are frequently testing and trying out new things in our business,\" said Walmart Canada spokesperson Anika Malik in an email.\n\nWith Walmart Canada's scan-and-go system, shoppers used an in-store mobile device to scan items. (Walmart Canada)\n\nIn the U.S., Walmart stores abandoned scan and go earlier this year. It blamed customer \"friction points,\" such as having to weigh their own produce and facing receipt-checks at the door to combat theft.\n\n\"That's why you have to test these things, because if inadvertently you're adding friction instead of taking away friction, that's when the technology fails,\" said Winder, a co-founder of the Retail Advisors Network.\n\nWhen asked about theft, Loblaws suggested it wasn't a concern. \"Canadians have been responsibly checking out their own products for decades,\" said Thomas.\n\nScan and go lives on\n\nDespite its setbacks, Walmart in the U.S. hasn't completely dropped scan and go.\n\nThe retailer reports that at its big-box membership store, Sam's Club, shoppers have actually embraced it.\n\nAs a result, Walmart opened its first Sam's Club Now last week in Texas, a cashierless store where shoppers can only purchase items using the scan-and-go app on their mobile phones.\n\nThe store still has employees, called \"member hosts,\" who offer in-store assistance.\n\n\"As shopping preferences evolve, we'll give members and customers options to shop in new ways,\" said U.S.-based Walmart spokesperson Carrie McKnight in an email.\n\nBut ultimately, shoppers will get to decide if what retailers are offering will be part of their shopping experience of the future."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Mike Crawley", "title": "What will Doug Ford's climate change plan look like?

A key reason why: the Australian authorities have raised the limits on GHG emissions for many heavy industrial polluters, neutralizing the emission reductions that the government (and taxpayers) paid to achieve.\n\n\"When you hear the Ford government say that they're going to have an Australia plan, translate those words in your head \u2014 what it means is they have a plan to increase emissions,\" said Amir Attaran, senior lawyer for the group Ecojustice, which is fighting Ontario's recent environmental moves in court.\n\n\"If they follow Australia's model, there is no chance in hell that emissions will go down,\" Attaran said Tuesday in an interview from Ottawa.\n\nMark Cameron, executive director of Canadians for Clean Prosperity, a pro-business group that supports carbon pricing, says there is some evidence that the Australian type of system can actually work to reduce emissions. However, he says it is not as efficient as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade.\n\nIn August, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, left, and Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg abandoned plans to legislate to limit greenhouse gas emissions to head off a revolt by conservative lawmakers in the House of Representatives, where Turnbull's conservative coalition held only a single-seat majority. (Rod McGuirk/Associated Press)\n\n\"It essentially involves government paying directly instead of the market encouraging people to reduce emissions on their own,\" said Cameron in an interview Tuesday from Ottawa.\n\nGiven that the Ford government says it's cash strapped, where would it come up with the money for such a fund to pay companies? It turns out there's nearly $1 billion sitting unspent that was raised through the previous Liberal government's cap-and-trade program \u2014 money that must, by law, be spent on initiatives to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nBy threatening to \"come down hard\" on what he calls \"polluters,\" Ford himself has hinted that the climate change plan will in some way target large industrial emitters such as steel and cement plants. That could involve setting an annual limit on each factory's carbon emissions and charging a fee for every tonne it emits above that amount.\n\nIt's a system that gets support from Ford's fellow anti-carbon-tax crusader Jason Kenney, the leader of Alberta's opposition United Conservative Party. But Ontario's Green Party is not as enthusiastic.\n\n\"If this government wants to come in with the heavy hand of regulation to drive down emissions, that would achieve it,\" Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said in an interview at Queen's Park this week.\n\n\"But it would do it at a higher cost and that cost will eventually get passed on to people.\"\n\nThe shortcoming of that model is that heavy industry is only responsible for about one-quarter of Ontario's carbon footprint. Driving our vehicles and heating our homes and workplaces each account for more greenhouse gases. It's not clear what the Ford government will do to try to bring down emissions in those sectors.\n\nOntario is already two-thirds of the way toward meeting Ottawa's 2030 target (reducing emissions by 30 per cent from the baseline of 2005). The bulk of those reductions came from shutting down all of the province's coal-fired power plants"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "\u00c9ric Grenier", "title": "The NDP is in trouble - and that's bad news for the Conservatives", "description": "As the next federal election approaches, Andrew Scheer's Conservatives might be asking themselves whether they can win without a strong NDP.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservatives-ndp-1.4912981", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4913581.1542746376!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/conservatives-caucus-20181107.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T09:00:00Z", "content": "As the next federal election approaches, Andrew Scheer's Conservatives might be asking themselves whether they can win without a strong NDP.

The party sits at 15.8 per cent support in the CBC's Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data. That number would put it on track for its worst performance since 2004. At that level of support, the New Democrats likely would win around 20 seats \u2014 less than half of the party's current standing in the House of Commons.\n\nSingh hasn't been able to make a very strong impression on Canadians so far. The impression that he has left is trending negative. The latest survey from Abacus Data found just 19 per cent of Canadians holding a positive view of the NDP leader, a number that has slid consistently from the 24 per cent Singh scored at the beginning of the year.\n\nNanos Research finds that just eight per cent of Canadians pick Singh as the best person to be prime minister, putting him only two points ahead of Elizabeth May, leader of the single-seat Greens, and six points ahead of Maxime Bernier, who formed the People's Party of Canada only a few months ago. Singh's numbers have been wobbling back and forth in Nanos's weekly tracking.\n\nFundraising is also going slowly for the party: it raised just $5.2 million in the year following Singh's leadership victory in October 2017. That's only marginally better than the party's performance in the preceding 12 months, when Tom Mulcair was at the helm as caretaker and members' fundraising was being diverted in part to the leadership contest to replace him. (The Conservatives have raised $22.7 million and the Liberals $15.3 million in the last year.)\n\nAn anemic NDP is part of the reason the Liberals still lead in the Poll Tracker with 37.8 per cent support \u2014 but the Conservatives are playing a role in that as well.\n\nThe Conservative Party has 32.2 per cent support, a figure virtually unchanged since the 2015 federal election. Certainly, Scheer would be trailing the Liberals by a smaller amount if the NDP was eating away at Liberal support \u2014 but he'd also be doing better if he was flipping swing voters over to his own party as well.\n\nThat's why a struggling NDP is a bad omen for the Conservatives. A strong NDP can be a cause of a weak Liberal Party. It can also be a symptom.\n\nConservatives don't need a strong NDP - but it helps\n\nIt's no secret that Conservatives tend to welcome strong New Democrat polling. A robust NDP was cited as a necessity by Jenni Byrne, Stephen Harper's campaign manager, after the party was defeated in the 2015 federal election. The historical record shows why.\n\nIn the 18 elections held since the New Democrats' first contested an election in 1962, the party has averaged 14.8 per cent of the vote whenever the Liberals have formed government. They have averaged 19.6 per cent of the vote in the elections that ended in victory for the Conservatives (or their predecessors, the Progressive Conservatives).\n\nThe tipping point for the Conservatives seems to be around 17 per cent support for the NDP. New Democrats have managed 17 per cent of the vote or less in eight elections. The Liberals won seven of those; in the eighth election, in 1962, John Diefenbaker's PCs were reduced from a record-breaking majority government to a slim minority.\n\nOf the elections that saw the NDP receive more than 17 per cent support, however, six ended in victory for the Conservatives and four left the Liberals in power (in two of those four Liberal wins, however, the party was kept to a minority).\n\nTwo of the three majority governments the Conservatives have secured since 1962 coincided with the NDP's best ever results \u2014 in 1988 (20.4 per cent) and in 2011 (30.6 per cent). The Conservatives' third majority, in 1984, happened as the NDP took 18.8 per cent of the vote \u2014 its fifth-best result.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has not seen his party's support increase in the polls and his own personal popularity has been trending negative. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nIt's a small sample size, but it does suggest a pattern. When the NDP is struggling, the Liberals have a high likelihood of winning. When the NDP is doing well, the Conservatives tend to have the edge. With the New Democrats currently under 16 per cent, the Poll Tracker accordingly gives the Conservatives less than a one-in-eight chance of winning the most seats in an election held today.\n\nIt isn't, however, a simple matter of vote-splitting between Liberals and New Democrats. For example, the PC landslide majority government in 1984, when Brian Mulroney captured 50 per cent of the vote, had nothing to do with a split centre-left vote.\n\nInstead, the NDP's score was a reflection of the weakness of the Liberals at the time: in that election, the Liberals lost votes to the PCs as well as the NDP.\n\nDecisive seats at stake\n\nThere isn't a strong regional character to this pattern. In elections the Conservatives win, the New Democrats have tended to perform six percentage points higher in British Columbia and Quebec than they do when the Liberals win. In Ontario, the NDP tends to perform four points higher in elections the Conservatives win. A boom in NDP support in any one region isn't enough to push the Conservatives over the top: they need New Democrats to be doing well pretty much everywhere.\n\nA large part of the reason the Liberals are looking good for the 2019 election right now is the drop in NDP poll numbers Quebec \u2014 the party is down nine points there from the last election. The Poll Tracker suggests that the Liberals are in a position to pick up about 14 seats in Quebec at the NDP's expense.\n\n(One wild card to consider for 2019 is the performance of the Greens, currently sitting at 7.5 per cent in the Poll Tracker, their highest level of support since before the last election. If the party's support increases significantly, as it did in the last provincial elections in B.C. and New Brunswick, it could have an unpredictable effect on the results. Or, the party's support could deflate by election day, as has happened in the past.)\n\nThe Conservatives can take advantage of the NDP's slide in a few areas of the country, particularly in the Prairies. But the Liberals have potential for gains in B.C.'s Lower Mainland as well, making it a bit of a wash. The Conservatives have little to gain directly from a weaker NDP.\n\nBut they have much to gain (indirectly) from a stronger NDP. There could be dozens of ridings around the country (in the Greater Toronto Area, especially) where Liberals and Conservatives are looking at close contests next year, and where the NDP has little historical support. In those ridings, even small shifts in the New Democrat vote could have large effects on the results.\n\nSo Scheer might spend the next 11 months looking at two sets of numbers in the polls to get a sense of his chances in 2019 \u2014 his own and Singh's."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Matthew Braga", "title": "Harmless viral Facebook post is another reminder how easy it is to make online fakes", "description": "Social media platforms continue to help amplify false posts and misinformation, and the onus has largely shifted, unfairly or not, onto users to sort out what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/viral-facebook-post-misinformation-trust-1.4913930", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898441.1541728045!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/facebook-results.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T09:00:00Z", "content": "At first glance it looked like your typical viral Facebook post.

There was the small boy, posing for what appeared to be his school's photo day \u2014 his face contorted in raw anger, directed straight to the camera. A man claiming to be the boy's dad offered some context: He said he ate his son's Pop Tart before the photos were taken, and his furious son swore never to smile again.\n\nIt was the sort of mildly funny, saccharine post that's easy catnip on the internet \u2014 and by Tuesday morning, it had racked up 300,000 shares on Facebook, three days after it was first posted.\n\nBut almost immediately, it became clear that not everything was as it appeared. Commenters turned on the poster, claiming the child wasn't actually his. Elsewhere on Facebook, the boy's actual mom posted a message calling out the viral poster for trying to pass off her son as his own. Unsurprisingly, her post garnered far fewer shares than the one that went viral in the first place.\n\nThe whole saga, brief as it was, is a good reminder of how easy it has become online to pass misinformation off as authentic \u2014 both how social media platforms continue to help amplify false posts and misinformation, and how the onus has largely shifted, unfairly or not, onto users to sort out what's real and what's not.\n\nSome of this can be blamed on the design of social platforms themselves. Facebook in particular operates on the premise that everyone is playing by the same rules and presenting their most authentic selves. But in practice, this positioning has just made it harder to distinguish the people and pages who are truly authentic versus those just pretending.\n\nPut another way, when something becomes popular on Facebook, the majority of users tend to believe, in good faith, that the person posting it is doing so authentically \u2014 because that's what Facebook has taught us to expect. If you've ever wondered why Facebook is so keen on referring to misinformation and foreign influence operations using the clunky phrase \"inauthentic behaviour,\" this is it.\n\nYou can see this tension at play elsewhere across Facebook and beyond. There are entire communities of people on Instagram, for example, that pretend to pass off other people's children as their own. What some have called \"digital kidnapping\" is basically a form of online roleplay. Users pretend to be parents of the children whose photos they've stolen from other accounts, while others pretend to be the children themselves. Were it not for the roleplay-related hashtags identifying the accounts as such, it would be easy, at a glance, not to realize the photos had been taken from somewhere else.\n\nIn the bigger picture it's why \u2014 for all of the hand-wringing about deep fakes and artificially created images, voices, and videos \u2014 real media that has merely been misrepresented or distorted is arguably just as much of a threat \u2014 if not a more realistic one. It's why Russian influence operations on Facebook and Twitter have more recently found success by pushing legitimate partisan causes, rather than outright fake news.\n\nIt's why it's harder than ever to take the things we see online at face value now (though it's debatable whether we ever should have in the first place). It's also a reminder of how the onus has shifted on consumers to think more critically about what they engage with online \u2014 a feat that becomes harder and harder as convincing fakes and misinformation become easier to pull off. As a result, even innocuous viral Facebook posts are a reminder of how easy it has become to game the system, making it harder to know who to trust.\n\nIt might not be such a big deal when you're dealing with a harmless meme, but when the same tactics can be applied to foreign-backed misinformation campaigns intent on disrupting democracy and sowing division, the stakes are high."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Matt Kwong", "title": "What Trump surrendered by giving Saudi crown prince a pass in Khashoggi's killing", "description": "He promised to be the \"law and order\" president.

To suddenly force them to switch to Chinese or Russian weapons would interrupt supply chains, interfere with weapons compatibility, and require major retraining.\n\n\"When you mix stuff up, it's a real problem [over the long-term],\" Jervis said.\n\nGiving power to Riyadh\n\nHe also said some regional experts believe the alleged 2017 kidnapping and suspected forced resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri by the Saudis only served to strengthen the position of Iran, Riyadh's regional rival in the Middle East.\n\nThe leader of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed faction, blasted Hariri's temporary resignation \u2014 he rescinded a month later \u2014 as \"a Saudi decision.\"\n\nIn that way, Jervis said, the reliance on Saudi Arabia \"is not an effective anti-Iran strategy.\"\n\nBeyond strategic alliances in the region, there's a personal affinity that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner appears to hold for MbS.

We really got on the grind.\"\n\nWatch the Oilers upend the Sharks:\n\nEdmonton edges San Jose 4-3 in overtime, Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl 3 points each. 2:09\n\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins added a short-handed goal and Mikko Koskinen made 22 saves.\n\nJoe Thornton assisted on Marcus Sorensen's goal in the first period to tie Mario Lemieux for 11th place all-time with his 1,033rd helper. Joonas Donskoi and Logan Couture also scored for San Jose.\n\n\"Tonight's a disappointing one because I thought if we had gotten a little bit better effort from everybody, from 20 guys, we should have gotten two points,\" coach Peter DeBoer said. \"We didn't have enough participants tonight. We didn't play well enough for long enough stretches. It wasn't one or two guys, it was almost everybody.\"\n\nThe Sharks took a 3-2 lead in the final minute of the second period when Couture deked Adam Larsson on the rush and beat Koskinen for his first goal in 11 games.\n\nBut the Oilers responded early in the third when McDavid set up Caggiula on an odd-man rush for the equalizer less than four minutes into the period.\n\nSomeone on that bench is particularly happy. \ud83d\ude0f <a href=\"https://t.co/jlRUpEygdV\">pic.twitter.com/jlRUpEygdV</a> \u2014@NHL\n\n\"There are too many odd-man rushes,\" Couture said. \"It wasn't horrible tonight. It was better than it has been, but still too many. Especially when you are out there against Connor. You can't give them that many chances. He's their best player.\"\n\nThe Hitchcock era got off to a rough start for the Oilers, who allowed a goal in the opening minute when Donskoi was left alone in front of the net after a faceoff win by San Jose. Brent Burns' shot from the point was stopped by Koskinen, but Donskoi was able to backhand the rebound in.\n\nMcDavid got the equalizer midway through the period when he beat Burns down the slot to take a feed from Draisaitl and knocked it in for his milestone goal. McDavid reached the mark in his 230th game. Only Wayne Gretzky (145 games), Glenn Anderson (183) and Jari Kurri (214) got there faster for the Oilers.\n\nThornton then reached his milestone later in the period when he fed Sorensen from behind the goal line for a one-timer that beat Koskinen.\n\nEdmonton tied the game early in the second when Nugent-Hopkins converted a 2-on-1 off a feed from Kyle Brodziak after the Sharks turned the puck over in the offensive zone on a power play.\n\n\"Obviously it says something about your team, that you need to start playing better,\" Nugent-Hopkins said. \"We need to make a push here now. Our last eight or so games haven't been good enough. I felt tonight we responded well, so we just have to keep that going.\"\n\nNotes: McDavid has 31 points, becoming the first Oilers player to reach 30 in 21 or fewer games since Mark Messier did it in 19 games in 1989-90. ...

You want to sleep but can't fall asleep.\n\nYou get some downtime to process things on your own but just spiral into memories and what-ifs and loneliness.\n\nNothing you had planned for the weekend happens or matters.\n\nYou then realize that he, and everyone else in the world, never plans for someone to root through their phone without them there.\n\nEveryone in the family just wanders around like zombies from place to place and no one else minds. You constantly police your own behaviour and emotional displays for the first few hours and then you completely let go and don't care about how anyone sees you.\n\nYou start to hear about everyone who was better off for knowing your dad. All the people he coached, worked with, helped out, and showed kindness to.\n\nAnd then you realize that to you he was Dad, but he had other names: brother, uncle, son, partner, friend. And the community that is grieving gets a bit bigger.\n\nYou see your Christmas tree from the corner of your eye and remember that you're only six weeks until Christmas and it's going to be such a bad one.\n\nYou hear from people you haven't talked to in years, and almost feel bad that THEY are wishing YOU condolences because they also knew my dad and have their own right to feel grief too.\n\nYou scroll to your most recent non-death post from yesterday and are shocked at how far away it seems. Time moves so slowly.\n\nYou start looking into paperwork for death certificates and bank accounts and get immediately frustrated, put it to the side until you're ready for the headache it will bring.\n\nYou realize that because he died at work, you also have to deal with WCB, which just feels like extra punishment.\n\nEvery cliche you hear about sudden deaths comes true. You always think you have more time. You question that last encounter, those calls you chose to miss, what you wanted to say that you never can now.\n\nYou stand at Arrivals in the airport with everyone waiting for a family member and when he gets in you feel a bit more unified as a family but there is still something missing that will never come back.\n\nEven though it's past 2 a.m., you'll still be a while from being able to sleep, and it won't be for more than a few hours.\n\nYou start to catch yourself unconsciously using past tense to refer to him, and it makes you sad that your brain understood so quickly that he isn't coming back.\n\nTrying to figure out the code to their safe is really, really frustrating.\n\nYou meet friends of friends of your parent, people you haven't seen since you were a baby (if at all), and they show you so much love and kindness and tell you how much you look like them.\n\nYou spend an evening with your siblings and their partners and for the first time in two days you start talking about things other than your parent's death.

Glazer said in January his client has always maintained his innocence.\n\nIn a decision delivered on Monday, three Appeal Court justices dismissed Hall's appeal.\n\nWriting for the court, Justice Christopher J. Mainella said that many of the 12 grounds argued in the appeal were \"repetitive or of no merit.\" He found the trial judge had efficiently and succinctly instructed the jury on how to approach the DNA evidence.\n\nJust after 3 a.m. on Sept. 27, 2012, Lau and five friends were sitting in a restaurant booth when a shooter with his shirt pulled over his face came into the building and opened fire.\n\nLau was shot five times and died a short time later, while another man was shot and survived.\n\nDNA expert finds a match\n\nDuring the trial, an officer testified that a total of 19 rounds had been fired by the gunman, seven through the window from outside the restaurant, another 12 from inside.\n\nSeventy-two exhibits were documented as part of the crime scene, including samples of clothing worn by the shooter and recovered by police shortly afterward. An RCMP expert told court she found a match to Hall's DNA in the seven clothing samples that were adequate for such testing.\n\nThe appeal called that evidence \"meaningless\" because the clothing had a mixed DNA profile, but Mainella disputed some of its arguments.\n\n\"The accused went so far as to argue that it is impossible for a properly instructed jury to ever convict when there is a mixed DNA profile because one cannot tell which of the contributors may have perpetrated the crime,\" Mainella wrote in the court's decision. \"This logic is faulty.\"\n\nThe jury also heard videotaped police interviews with Justin Latinecz, one of the men who was at the table with Lau during the shooting. Latinecz was slain in 2013, almost to the exact day when Lau was killed the year before, so Glazer wasn't able to cross-examine him. Glazer also argued Latinecz was intoxicated while making his statement to police.\n\nHowever, Justice Mainella wrote, it was \"not a situation of gross intoxication,\" and found the trial judge had not erred in his decision to allow the jury to consider Latinecz's statements.\n\n\"In conclusion, I reject the accused's submission that the verdicts are unreasonable.

It's fascinating, to get a bird's eye view of a diving duck looking straight down through clear water, seeing how their feet are located so far back on their bodies and how they manoeuvre around.\n\nAlthough smaller than the common merganser, the hooded merganser is one of three different mergansers that's been sighted recently in southern Alberta. (Copyright free photo)\n\nQ: What do they look like?\n\nA: They've got a long red bill, narrow red bill \u2014 a serrated bill, if you get close enough to look at \u2014 which readily distinguishes the merganser from all the other ducks.\n\nThe legs and feet are also a deep red in colour.\n\nThe males are big \u2014 up to about 1.5 kilograms (3.5 pounds) in size, so they're among the largest ducks. They're quite a bit less stocky than the other one you might confuse it with, which is the goldeneye on the river.\n\nWhen they fly, they look elongated \u2014 almost like they've been stretched \u2014 and they fly in long trailing lines. If there's a number of them flying together, they'll fly one after the other and usually low over the water.\n\nRight now, the males have a beautiful greenish-black crest on their black head, on their upper neck, and below that, a creamy white underside, and they've got black backs, so they're very boldly coloured.\n\nWhen you see them on the river, you can't mistake them for anything else.\n\nThe females have a red tufted head \u2014 in fact, it looks like they have a Phyllis Diller hairdo. Their hair is swept straight back. Just imagine heading into the wind at high speeds and all the hair going straight back.\n\nThe red-breasted merganser is one of three different mergansers that's been sighted recently in Calgary. (Abi Warner Photography)\n\nQ: Why is this a good time to see them?\n\nA: They're migrating through. I suspect a lot of their areas are freezing up with that cold spell we had last week, so they're coming in, and our Bow River is excellent for good fish, and these guys are professional fish catchers.\n\nThey don't eat just fish, but they also go after crustaceans.\n\nAlso, they're at their greatest number right now. They average about 12 eggs per clutch and they've actually found up to 17 eggs in a nest.\n\nAnd it's not unusual to see 20 or 30 babies following one female, because [their perspective is] as long as that bird looks like mom, I'm going to hang out with her. I don't care if she's my real mom. The female doesn't feed the babies. She just leads them from one good feeding place to another.\n\nOnly two days after they're born, baby mergansers are already capable of diving.\n\nFor the first 12 days of their life, they're after insects \u2014 and then they turn onto fish.\n\nQ: Where do they nest?\n\nA: They actually find old woodpecker holes, or natural large cavities in trees \u2014 so in association with old growth forests.\n\nThey're a northern bird. You find them throughout the boreal forest, in those clean lakes up there and even, of course, right here along the Bow River, but because of the rarity of these holes, sometimes they have to nest a long way away from water, and sometimes, up to 30 metres up above the ground.\n\nQ: Is the common merganser the only kind spotted in Calgary?\n\nA: No, we've got three species in North America and all of them are found in Alberta. I've seen all three in Alberta. Just this past spring, I was down at Frank Lake and saw a hooded merganser, which is a much smaller merganser but is stunning, actually, with its big white crest and its oversized head \u2014 and it does a wonderful little mating dance when its courting the females.\n\nAnd then there's the red-breasted merganser, which is actually the furthest northern nesting merganser, just south of the tundra landscape in the boreal forest.\n\nAnd then of course there's the common merganser.\n\nThe next few days are going to be fairly mild for Calgary at the end of November and the ducks who like to hang out on the Bow River are loving every minute of it. Brian Keating is our Homestretch naturalist, and he's just 'ducky' right now. He joined host Doug Dirks in studio to talk about our ducky friends. 8:00\n\nQ: Do they sound like a duck?\n\nA: Maybe a mallard with a head cold. Not really very duck-like.\n\nThey're usually quiet out and there being pretty\u2014 and when you look as good as a merganser, you don't have to quack.\n\nWith files from The Homestretch"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jennie Russell", "title": "Concerns over Covenant Health assisted-dying policy 'addressed,' Alberta health minister says", "description": "Health Minister Sarah Hoffman says her government has \u201caddressed\u201d issues with Covenant Health\u2019s assisted-dying policy, despite lingering concerns from academics, patient advocacy groups and families of patients.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/covenant-health-assisted-dying-policy-address-hoffman-1.4913895", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4913916.1542757317!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/sarah-hoffman.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:36:48Z", "content": "Alberta Health Minister Sarah Hoffman says her government has \"addressed\" issues with Covenant Health's assisted-dying policy, despite lingering concerns from academics, patient advocacy groups and families of patients who say forcing patients to go off-site \u2026 [+4429 chars]", "fulltext": "Alberta Health Minister Sarah Hoffman says her government has \"addressed\" issues with Covenant Health's assisted-dying policy, despite lingering concerns from academics, patient advocacy groups and families of patients who say forcing patients to go off-site to access the services has traumatized them.\n\n\"We have addressed those concerns and we have made sure that the new [assisted-dying] model continues to work in a way that respects patients and their choices,\" Hoffman told the legislature Tuesday in response to a question from an opposition MLA during question period.\n\nAlberta Party MLA Rick Fraser, a paramedic, had asked why the minister has allowed Covenant Health's policy for more than two years, despite knowing some patients had struggled to exercise their legal right to an assisted death because of it.\n\nHoffman, as she has previously, refused to answer that question.\n\nOver the past month, CBC News has revealed how some terminally ill patients have suffered under Covenant Health's policy on medical assistance in dying (MAID) and have been forced to leave their publicly funded health facilities \u2014 some, taking to the streets outside \u2014 just to access services.\n\nIn 2016, the NDP government under Hoffman exempted the Catholic health provider from having to provide access to MAID services on its properties.\n\nCovenant Health's default position is that patients cannot even sign the form requesting an assisted death, or receive assessments by Alberta Health Services (AHS) staff, on its property. Patients are always transferred elsewhere for the assisted death itself.\n\nFollowing publication of CBC News reports on the issue and the ensuing public backlash, Covenant Health said it is reviewing its policy on assisted dying.\n\nHoffman, who is overseeing that review, told the legislature she expects Covenant Health's new policy will allow all patients to undergo MAID assessments without leaving their Covenant beds.\n\n\"This fiscal year nobody has had to be removed for an assessment to be done,\" Hoffman said.\n\n\"I have asked (Covenant Health) to make sure that they update their policy to reflect that that will be the expectation moving forward,\" she continued. \"And if it doesn't do so, I will act myself.\"\n\nBut in a Monday interview with the CBC program Alberta at Noon, Covenant Health CEO Patrick Dumelie signalled the health provider's review will not be comprehensive.\n\n\"While the individual has a legal right to terminate their life in certain circumstances, we believe that our beliefs and our rights have to be equally respected,\" he said.\n\nDumelie twice refused to directly answer the question of whether Covenant's new policy will allow, as a default, patients to undergo their AHS assessments on site.\n\nMinister has refused to confront issue, professor says\n\nAs individuals, health-care practitioners have a Charter-protected legal right to refrain from facilitating assisted dying. It is not, however, established in Canadian law that health institutions like Covenant Health have that same legal right.\n\nEthics and legal experts, and patient advocacy groups, have called Covenant Health's policy inhumane and said it infringes on the rights of patients.\n\n66-year-old Doreen Nowicki had to have her assisted-dying assessment on the sidewalk in May 2017 because of Covenant Health's actions. (Nowicki family) Those patients include Doreen Nowicki, a 66-year-old ALS patient who in May 2017 was forced to have her assisted-dying assessment on an Edmonton sidewalk because of a last-minute Covenant decision. Nowicki could not walk or speak, and had to be wheeled outside as she sobbed.\n\nBob Hergott, 72 years old and effectively paralyzed, signed his assisted-dying request in a bus shelter because his Covenant hospital of five years would not allow him to do so on site.\n\nAnd in July 2016 \u2014 less than two months after MAID became legal in Canada \u2014 an AHS doctor complained to Hoffman that a rural Alberta patient nearly bled out and died of natural causes after Covenant initially prevented him from accessing MAID services.\n\nIn the legislature Tuesday, Hoffman said she recognized Covenant's actions created \"some situations that were very difficult for families.\" She thanked Nowicki's family for meeting with her earlier this month to discuss their concerns.\n\nNowicki's family told CBC News they were disappointed by that meeting. The family, which wants Covenant patients to access all MAID services on site, said Hoffman appeared unwilling to bring about any sort of meaningful change to Covenant's policy.\n\nSpeaking Monday on Alberta at Noon, health-law professor Ubaka Ogbogu said he is also disappointed in Hoffman's response so far.\n\n\"I think the real problem here is that the minister has failed to acknowledge that Covenant Health is doing something that is incredibly, incredibly wrong and shows a lack of compassion and understanding of its role in the health-care system,\" Ogbogu said.\n\n\"And until there is a frank acknowledgment of that issue, I don't think we are going to come to a compromise that is acceptable to everyone involved.\"\n\nIf you have information about this story, please contact us in confidence at cbcinvestigates@cbc.ca.\n\n\n\n@jennierussell_"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Woman struck and killed by TTC bus at Lawrence West station", "description": "A woman is dead after she was struck by a TTC bus at Lawrence West subway station Tuesday evening.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/woman-killed-ttc-bus-lawrence-west-station-1.4913931", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4500165.1531870249!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/stock-crime-scene-police-tape-do-not-cross-yellow-tape-forensics-investigation-generic.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:21:18Z", "content": "A woman has been pronounced dead after she was struck by a TTC bus at Lawrence West subway station Tuesday evening.

Nadeau found that the child's rights were violated and that her \"dignity, integrity and autonomy\" were compromised.\n\nThe child was under the care of Batshaw Youth and Family Centres, the agency that serves English-speaking Montrealers.\n\nShe was just nine when the first of the incidents occurred.\n\nExcerpts of staff reports included in the ruling reveal in detail how the girl and different boys who were also in Batshaw's care engaged in sexual activity, ranging from touching genitals to vaginal penetration \u2014 often against the girl's stated wishes.\n\n\"X and the boy are clear that she told him to stop, but he did not,\" a youth protection staff member notes in an evaluation report about one of the incidents in 2017.\n\nThat incident took place in a bathroom in the group home. The boy involved was 10 at the time.\n\n\"He proceeded to remove their clothing, touched her vaginal area, and tried to insert his penis in her vagina. He was also coercive in promising her an MP3 player and a fidget spinner to keep quiet,\" the report reads.\n\nAll three incidents occurred at the same group home between November 2016 and August 2017.\n\nThe names of the social workers of the children involved were all withheld in the Oct. 4, 2018 court decision, which was made public Tuesday. The ruling was leaked to La Presse last week.\n\nThe girl's social workers flagged their concerns to their superiors at Batshaw on numerous occasions, according to Nadeau's ruling.\n\nOne social worker said that she was \"appalled, angry and sad after being advised of what happened and that it never should have happened.\"\n\n'Chaotic' home life\n\nThe girl was first placed in the care of youth protection in 2013, at the age of six, after living in a \"chaotic,\" sexualized and drug-filled environment in which her \"basic physical needs\" and \"health care\" were neglected.\n\nA year later, a staff evaluation noted that she \"continued to demonstrate signs of trauma, avoiding sleep and becoming hypervigilant and disruptive in the evening or at bedtimes.\"\n\nHer mother was ultimately sentenced to 18 months in jail for the abuse of her daughter.\n\nThe girl spent time in foster homes and rehabilitation centres before being placed in the group home due to the \"higher level of structure required by the child.\"\n\nThe group home was intended for children between the ages of 10 and 14, often for stays of six to 12 months, and staff there were faced with formidable challenges.\n\nAccording to a social worker cited in the ruling, the children placed there could \"exhibit highly aggressive and sexualized behaviours, as well as psychiatric disorders.\"\n\nStaff turnover, poor clinical model to blame\n\nBatshaw Youth and Family Centres serves English-speaking Montrealers. (CBC)\n\nIn his judgment, Nadeau said the \"Director of Youth Protection admits that there was a lack of appropriate supervision, as well as a lack of understanding of safety plans during all three incidents.\"\n\nNadeau concluded that the incidents were the result of a \"high level of staff turnover\" and an \"inappropriate clinical program model\" lacking in oversight.\n\nA total of 33 social workers are cited in the ruling, suggesting challenges in ensuring continuity of the child's care.\n\nHe noted that improvements were made last year to the group home's clinical program. It now involves a more \"individualized approach,\" he said.\n\nAs part of the ruling, Nadeau ordered that a \"qualified person acting as a shadow be appointed to the child at all times while she is under the care\" of the rehabilitation centre chosen by the youth protection agency.\n\nChanges made, agency says\n\nCIUSSS de l'Ouest-de-l'\u00cele-de-Montr\u00e9al, the regional health agency which oversees Batshaw, refused a request for an interview, citing the Youth Protection Act, which guarantees client confidentiality.\n\nIn a statement, the agency said \"measures were taken immediately following the incidents and those measures ordered by the court were put in place.\"\n\n\"The program in question has undergone a complete review and has now been implemented in its new form,\" the statement said."}]
