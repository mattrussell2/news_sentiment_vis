All reports have so far been limited to the \"B.E.C\" Lot 4B2L3 packaged in 3.5 gram bottles, the company said.\n\nThe company said it has also received a report that RedeCan products may contain bugs, but said this report is mistaken.\n\nJames Scott, with the University of Toronto's school of public health, says he thinks the mould came from having too much moisture in the product when it was sealed. (Submitted)\n\nJames Scott, who studies mould with the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said the health impacts of smoking mouldy weed depends on a person's overall health.\n\nThose with reduced immunity are most at risk, and could wind up with a lung infection, he said. People with asthma \u2014about 12 per cent of the adult population, Scott said \u2014 and those with allergies could also experience asthma attacks and symptoms like watery eyes and a runny nose.\n\n\"A small exposure is innocuous, a larger exposure can cause harm,\" Scott said.\n\nWhere'd it come from?\n\nRedeCan said they have not yet determined how the mould appeared, and are working with the OCS to find the source.\n\nIn Scott's opinion, it's most likely that the batch simply had too much water in it when it was packaged.\n\n\"There's no shortage of fungal spores so once you put those things together in a sealed container, within a few days the mould can simply take over,\" he said, adding that it's unlikely postal delays had anything to do with it.\n\n\"This is not a Canada Post problem. This is a problem where the material was packaged prior to establishing appropriate water condition for it.\"\n\nA 34-year-old London, Ont., woman said found mould growing inside a nugget of cannabis she ordered from the Ontario Cannabis Store. (Paula Duhatschek/CBC)\n\nIn their statement to media, RedeCan said they are requesting a return of all units of the B.E.C. brand, and are working with OCS to figure out logistics of the return.\n\n\"With the cooperation of Health Canada, all batch samples of B.E.C. will be tested and verified by an independent third party,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Not only do we accept that we have a responsibility to comply with industry standards relating to the production and distribution of cannabis products, but we strive actively to exceed expectations in this regard.\"\n\nFor Scott, although the overall risk to the public is not \"the highest level,\" he hopes with cannabis being legal, the government will now be able to track contaminated batches and improve the system.\n\nThat idea was echoed by the woman who ordered the contaminated batch, who said she hopes situations like this one will spur producers to do better.\n\n\"It's these kinds of checks and balances and reports that are going to impact those companies and force them to adhere to more strict regulations,\" she said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Canadian Press", "title": "TRC heard concerns about coerced sterilization of Indigenous women, says Murray Sinclair", "description": "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission heard concerns about coerced sterilization of Indigenous women during its years-long examination of Canada's residential school legacy, Sen.

He asked for Canada to examine specific criminal provisions related to forced sterilization, whether it is perpetrated by a public agent or private individual.\n\nWhen NDP MP Niki Ashton commented on the rapporteur's concerns in question period on Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called coerced sterilization of some Indigenous people a serious violation of human rights.\n\n\"We know that Indigenous patients can face systemic barriers in accessing services, including discrimination and racism,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\"We will continue working with partners to ensure all Indigenous Peoples have access to culturally safe health services no matter where they live in Canada.\"\n\nCourt action in Sask.\n\nForced sterilization is also at the centre of a proposed class-action lawsuit in Saskatchewan.\n\nAlisa Lombard, an associate with a law firm leading a proposed class action on forced sterilization of Indigenous women, said Thursday that immediate action is required to prevent the practice and protect Indigenous women.\n\nAny national investigation into the issue should not prevent authorities from moving ahead on action, she added, including outlawing forced sterilization in the Criminal Code.\n\nLombard's firm, Maurice Law, has listed the Saskatoon Health Authority, the provincial government, the federal government and medical professionals as defendants in its statement of claim for the lawsuit.\n\nThe court action was launched in 2017 by two of the affected women, who each claimed $7 million in damages.

He wrote a book called The Encyclopedia of Money and says George Washington ($1 bill), Alexander Hamilton ($10 bill) and Benjamin Franklin ($100 bill) will likely hold their place on America's currency for years to come.\n\n\"They are called Founding Fathers,\" said Allen, \"They're considered very important figures in the history of this country. They accomplished something many people [thought] could not have been done. So, short of deification, they are definitely put on a pedestal.\"\n\nAmerica also continues to circulate the penny, even though it's worth less than the cost of minting it.

He has been the face of the bill for over 100 years.

But while the brand may be strong, the technology is lacking.\n\n\"Technologically, they are behind the world because polymer is the form of choice for currency and they're still well behind that with no apparent plans to switch to polymer,\" said Olmstead.\n\nThe U.S. is 'politically paralyzed' when it comes to currency changes\n\nIt's an interesting contrast to the rapid pace of technological change in other areas of American life, says Olmstead. After all, Apple, Tesla and Amazon are all U.S. companies reshaping the fabric of society.\n\nBut that kind of change happens in the economic sphere and Olmstead says altering the face of the currency falls more on the political side.\n\n\"They just sit still. That's why they still have the penny; they still use the paper dollar bill instead of the coin,\" said Olmstead. \"They're politically paralyzed when there are simple, logical solutions and everyone is doing them.\"\n\nOlmstead says the outcry about removing a Founding Father would be far more pronounced, compared to the rather muted reaction Canadians had to losing Sir John A.

He missed the podium by 1-10th of a second.\n\nA lack of success on the world's biggest stage may have dimmed his potential star power, but it never seemed to bother him.\n\n\"A lot of times we show up at these Olympics and it's supposed to be the greatest event on Earth, but in reality, it's a little bit of a Mickey Mouse show,\" he said in a 2017 interview.\n\nErik Guay retires: 'it doesn't make any sense to risk it'\n\nCBC Sports' Brenda Irving profiles the Canadian world champion downhill and super-G skier who announced his retirement on Thursday. 2:27\n\nHeading into retirement, his opinion hasn't changed.\n\n\"I have so many great memories, and you know, I think I'm leaving the sport with really a positive vibe.\"\n\nGuay was always about winning, whatever the race, and leaving everything out on the hill.\n\n\"I want to be competitive, but I'm also not here to waste my time. I don't want to finish 20th the whole year. I want to be on the podium,\" Guay says\n\nBut his legacy is about more than podiums or medals.\n\nErik Guay: 'When Manny crashed, I thought I should just take the lift down'\n\nCanadian alpine skier Erik Guay walks reporters through his sudden decision to retire. 1:33\n\n\"For myself personally, I think it started, really, with the Crazy Canucks. I think [they] set the bar for Canadian ski racing. That was inspirational for me,\" Guay says.\n\n\"And I just hope that I can return the favour. I hope I inspired some young racers out there to be better, and to continue to pursue their goals of being in the World Cup, and winning the World Cup and representing our country all over the globe.

They're telling the tribunal that Lockheed Martin's design will need substantial changes to meet the federal government's requirements, which would mean higher costs and more delays.\n\nThe company last week separately asked the Federal Court for a judicial review and an order quashing the decision, which saw Public Services and Procurement Canada select Lockheed Martin Canada as the preferred bidder on the $60 billion program.\n\nAlion pitched the De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn Air Defence and Command (LCF) frigate, a Dutch-designed warship that is already in service in other countries.\n\nMore delays?\n\nDepending upon how they play out, said defence procurement expert Dave Perry, both challenges have the potential to further delay the frigate program. Federal procurement officials had hoped to nail down a fully fledged design contract with Lockheed Martin by the winter.\n\nPerry, who works with the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said he expects those negotiations to continue \u2014 unless the Federal Court orders them to halt.\n\n\"Unless there is a compelling reason to stop, they are going to keep going,\" he said. \"There is a recognition of the urgency across the board.\"\n\nThat urgency is partly due to the program's legacy of delays, which have stretched the design competition out for almost two years.\n\nPublic Services and Procurement Canada would not comment on the matter because it is before the courts, but a senior official, speaking on background Thursday, said the federal government has up to 20 days to respond to the court challenge.\n\nThe official \u2014 who was not authorized to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the file \u2014 said there is flexibility built into the timeline and the government is optimistic it can meet its goal of an early 2019 contract signing.\n\nPerry said there are aspects of both the court challenge and the application to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal that he finds puzzling.\n\nAlion claimed in its court filing that the winning bid was \"incapable of meeting three critical mandatory requirements\" of the design tender.\n\nSpeed bump\n\nThe company said, for instance, that the Type 26 cannot meet the mandatory speed requirements set out by the navy and that both Public Services and Procurement Canada and Irving Shipbuilding, the yard overseeing the construction, should have rejected the bid outright.\n\nPerry said the criteria cited by Alion were among the first the federal government evaluated.\n\n\"The rest of Lockheed Martin's bid wouldn't have been looked at if the Crown and Irving was not satisfied that the bid met each of those [initial] criteria,\" he said. \"It's a weird dynamic.\"\n\nAlion's trade tribunal application argues in considerable detail that in order for the Type 26 to meet Ottawa's speed requirement, it will have to undergo considerable redesign.\n\nThe court application also cites the fact that the design tender was amended 88 times and those changes \"effectively diluted the [warship] requirements\" and allowed the government and Irving to select \"an unproven design platform.\"\n\nUnlike its two competitors, the Type 26 has yet to enter service with the Royal Navy. Competitors have privately knocked it as \"paper ship.\"\n\nNavantia, a Spanish-based company, was the other bidder in the competition."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Canadian Press", "title": "Vancouver-born animator brings the web to life in Ralph Breaks the Internet", "description": "Animating Ralph Breaks the Internet not only entailed summoning bold imagination to bring the World Wide Web to life \u2014 it also meant tapping into fond memories to recreate beloved Disney characters.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/ralph-canadian-animator-shum-1.4916818", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4916898.1542917574!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ralph-breaks-the-internet.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T20:35:58Z", "content": "Animating Ralph Breaks the Internet not only entailed summoning bold imagination to bring the World Wide Web to life it also meant tapping into fond memories to recreate beloved Disney characters.

I was like, 'Yes.' I bolted downstairs to the recording room. ... She was just so kind.\"\n\nThe movie, a sequel to 2012 hit Wreck-It Ralph, follows the title character voiced by John C. Reilly as he and his best friend Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) venture into the internet. The web is a chaotic, colourful city filled with incessant pop-up ads and skyscrapers bearing brand names, and the duo meet familiar characters and new friends.\n\nIn the standout princess sequence, Vanellope stumbles upon a gathering of iconic female characters including Mulan, Cinderella, Rapunzel, Snow White and Ariel. The group is skeptical that hoodie-clad Vanellope could be a princess, and the scene cleverly sends up the gender dynamics of Disney films past.\n\nA highlight of the new film is a sequence in which Sarah Silverman's Vanellope meets Disney's famed princesses, most of whom were voiced by the original actors. (Disney/Canadian Press)\n\nWatching Wen deliver her lines informed how Shum drew Mulan, a rare non-princess in the Disney canon. Animators try to figure out what voice actors are thinking, he said.\n\n\"What is going through their mind while they're saying this line? We try to animate that, and I think that's what gives the character a lot of layers and makes them feel like they're breathing and real.\"\n\nThe importance of drawing\n\nShum grew up in east Vancouver but now lives in sunny southern California as an animator for Walt Disney Animation Studios. His journey to his dream job took time: he wasn't accepted, initially, to his chosen college program, and his career bounced back and forth between animation and live-action visual effects.\n\nHis advice to those hoping to break into the industry is simple: just keep drawing.\n\n\"I think that's still a very important thing to do, even though a lot of stuff we do now is on the computer,\" he said.\n\nI love to see that my hometown is growing. ... There are a lot of amazing artists here. - Benson Shum\n\n\"Drawing will teach you about design, about how to pose a character and see things three-dimensionally.\"\n\nThough Shum left Vancouver, there's no shortage of opportunities in the city. It has come into its own as a graphics hotspot with about 60 animation and visual effects studios.\n\n\"Growing up, the industry wasn't really here. We had a few studios,\" he said, speaking in a Vancouver hotel during a recent visit. \"I love to see that my hometown is growing. ... There are a lot of amazing artists here.\"\n\nBenson Shum grew up in east Vancouver, but now lives in southern California as an animator for Walt Disney Animation Studios. (Alex Kang/Disney/CP)\n\nHis other credits at the studio include the original Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen and the upcoming and highly anticipated Frozen 2. Working on the Frozen franchise has been exciting because he grew up watching similar animated musicals, he said.\n\nSome 70 animators worked on Ralph Breaks the Internet. Shum was among six or seven who created a sequence in which Ralph plays an iPad game that involves swiping left and right to feed pancakes to a bunny and milkshakes to a cat. In typical Ralph style, he gets over-excited and stuffs the bunny with too many pancakes, with comically disastrous results.\n\nA two-second shot in that sequence took two weeks to animate, so the work can be painstaking. But the finished product makes it all worthwhile, Shum said.\n\n\"When you see the character come to life, I think that really makes you excited again. It's no longer a static object,\" he said.\n\n\"That always energizes you again to keep going.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jacques Poitras", "title": "Liberals test PC minority with push to bring shale gas issue to a vote", "description": "Liberal Leader Brian Gallant has introduced an amendment to the Progressive Conservative government\u2019s throne speech motion calling on the PCs \u201cto continue the moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in all parts of the province.\u201d", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/liberal-shale-gas-motion-pc-throne-speech-1.4916658", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4889222.1541173378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/blaine-higgs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T20:35:51Z", "content": "The Opposition Liberals have moved to force a vote in the legislature next Friday on the contentious issue of shale gas development.

He had picked up the gig during his time at the University of Ottawa as a way to help pay some bills.\n\n\"I was on the field. I was so close to the action,\" Ward said. \"I saw the interception by Toronto at the end of the game. I saw the fumble get returned back. I was actually on that sideline. I got to experience that as close as anyone could be.\"\n\nHe watched the players in warmup. He dreamt about what it would be like to be preparing for the game like they all were.\n\nNow one year later, Ward is getting ready for the game, and will be back on the sidelines at a Grey Cup \u2014 this time though, he'll be doing what he does best, kicking field goals for the Ottawa Redblacks in the biggest game of his life.\n\n\"I still have to pinch myself to believe this is all really happening,\" Ward said in preparation for Sunday's game against the Calgary Stampeders.\n\nFrom 2013 until the end of the 2017 season, Ward was the field goal kicker at the University of Ottawa. He finished his career with the Gee-Gees having made 89 consecutive field goals - the most in program and conference history and second-most in USports history.\n\nDespite his success, Ward went undrafted in the 2017 CFL draft. He went back to school for a fifth and final year before the Redblacks came knocking at the end of that football season.\n\n\"We had watched his draft film and I had him graded as the highest-rated kicker,\" special teams coach Bob Dyce said. \"We had worked him out. He did a great job. When we needed a new kicker, we brought him in.\"\n\nOttawa's kicker Brett Maher headed south to the NFL, at the end of the 2017 season, opening up the door for Ward to shine.

Ward was perfect on field goals in the pre-season and has never looked back.\n\n\"I had that confidence that I was going to be successful if I got a shot,\" Ward said. \"I consider myself a cool, calm, collected guy. I try not to let things faze me.\"\n\nWard, right, entered the CFL as one of the most accurate kickers in university history. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nSetting records along the way\n\nSince making the move from university kicker to security guard, and now pro kicker, Ward has been nothing short of sensational. His rookie year in the CFL has been remarkable.\n\nHis record-setting in the 2018 CFL season started early. During a game in late July, Ward tied an Ottawa football team record by kicking seven field goals in a game.\n\nA couple of weeks later in August, he set a new CFL rookie record by kicking 22 consecutive field goals. Then in September, that streak continued when he set the all-time CFL single-season record by kicking his 33rd consecutive field goal.\n\nBut the big record was still looming.\n\nOn Oct. 19 against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Ward broke the professional football record, breaking Adam Vinatieri's record from the NFL with his 45th straight field goal.\n\n\"I honestly had no idea until it happened,\" Ward said with a grin. \"My parents were in the crowd that day too. It was pretty special.\"\n\nWard finished the season making 51 of 52 field goals.\n\nOn Thursday night, Ward won both the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie Award and Most Outstanding Special Teams Player Award.\n\nWard made history against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in October. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nSoccer roots\n\nWard was born and raised in England. He grew up there until his family moved to Kingston, Ont., just before he was beginning high school.\n\nFooty has always been a part of his family.\n\nWard is a Liverpool fan while his dad roots for Birmingham \u2014 they have lively discussion over it.\n\nWard played soccer growing up, naturally.\n\n\"Since I was little, my dad said I could kick a soccer ball anywhere on the field and do what I wanted with it,\" Ward said. \"I guess it's kind of paying off now.\"\n\nWard says his parents are huge football fans now, attending nearly every home game in Ottawa and making some road trips for games throughout the season as well. They'll be at the game Sunday in Edmonton.\n\nThe 26-year-old kicker is back on the sidelines, ready to run out on the field this time. He says should the game come down to a last-second field goal, he's prepared.\n\n\"I would wish we were clearly winning the game but if that were the opportunity, then I need to take it.

Justice in the end will appear.\"\n\nTrump, in a statement on Tuesday, argued that punishing Saudi Arabia by \"foolishly cancelling\" Saudi arms deals worth billions of dollars to the U.S. would only benefit Russia and China.\n\nThe statement again pit Trump against U.S. intelligence, as has happened with the subject of Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election.

Watch it here.\n\nPutin's popularity\n\nVladimir Putin's popularity is plummeting as Russian voters rage over government pension reforms.\n\nA new poll, published today by the independent Levada Center, finds the Russian president's approval rating at 56 per cent, a five-year low. And the survey makes it clear that the public is increasingly unhappy with the direction the country is heading in.\n\nSixty-one per cent of respondents told Levada that they hold Putin \"fully\" responsible for Russia's problems, with another 22 per cent saying the president is \"somewhat\" to blame.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a reception in Moscow on Nov. 4 to mark National Unity Day. A poll released Thursday says that if an election were held today, just 40 per cent of Russians would vote for him. (Akexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIf an election were held today, just 40 per cent said they would cast a ballot for the man who has led them since 1999.\n\nPutin doesn't have to go to the polls until 2024, but the level of dissatisfaction is notable given that he won 77 per cent of the vote \u2014 his biggest-ever victory \u2014 in the March election.\n\nThe last time Putin's popularity fell below 60 per cent was in 2013, when the Russian economy began to stall as oligarchs moved their money offshore and oil prices declined.\n\nThis time, however, it is all his own doing, as voters lash out over his reforms to the country's crumbling pension system which have added five years to the retirement age.\n\nRussian police officers block demonstrators in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Sept. 9 during a rally protesting retirement age hikes. The poster reads: 'Putin's plan is genocide of people.' Nearly 300 people were reported arrested in protests across the country that day. (Roman Pimenov/Associated Press)\n\nIt hasn't been a good week for Putin on several fronts.\n\nAlexander Prokopchuk, the Kremlin's nominee for the presidency of Interpol, suffered a surprise election defeat yesterday as other nations threw their support behind Kim Jong Yang, the South Korean candidate.\n\nMaria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, placed the blame squarely on the United States this morning.\n\n\"The pre-election period was accompanied by an unprecedented campaign of misinformation, pressure and defamation,\" she said, referring to fears that Prokopchuk would use the powers of the international police body to punish Putin's critics. \"Unfortunately, it was launched against the candidate for this position from Russia at the United States' instigation.\"\n\nNow comes news that the head of the secretive GRU, the Russian military intelligence group that has been implicated in the British Novichok poisonings, has died.\n\nIgor Korobov, 62, reportedly passed away last night after a \"lengthy and grave illness.\"\n\nHe took over the job in early 2016, after his predecessor Igor Segun died suddenly at 58.\n\nGen. Col. Igor Korobov, head of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, speaks during a news conference in Moscow in August 2017. The Defense Ministry says the 62-year-old died Wednesday of 'a lengthy and grave illness.' (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP)\n\nBut at least Putin can still count on the state media to put a positive spin on things.\n\nTASS, the official Russian news agency, doesn't have a story on today's Levada Center survey, but it is covering another new poll.\n\nThe government-run All-Russia Public Opinion Research Centre reports that the level of happiness among Russians is still high, with 84 per cent of people reporting that they are \"content,\" and even 66 per cent of those in \"dire\" fiscal trouble saying they are \"optimistic.\"\n\nAt Issue\n\nTonight's At Issue panel looks at the fallout from Canada's fiscal plan to give tax breaks to businesses, writes Rosemary Barton.\n\nTurns out deficits aren't really so bad after all.\n\nAt least not for the Liberal government, and not when you're using them to respond to Trump's corporate tax rate cut.\n\nIt was clear Canada could not afford to reduce taxes as drastically as the Americans, so it decided instead to find ways to encourage investment by Canadian businesses by allowing them to write off pieces of equipment or what are called capital costs.\n\nIt's a big deal for businesses looking to buy new things. And it's a big deal for government expenditures, given that the plan is expected to cost more than $16 billion over the next six years.\n\nThe issue is that they are doing it by going deeper into the red. That is not what the government promised taxpayers.\n\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau speaks to the media about the fall economic update in Ottawa on Wednesday. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\n\nBut the Finance Minister told me that it's worth it. Canada leads G7 nations in economic growth, so the government believes it can afford to make an investment to see if it sparks more growth.\n\nOf course, that's just his take.\n\nFind out what At Issue has to say about that and tax credits for journalism later tonight.

He's upset by the behaviour of some of the newly arrived migrants who've been massing in the town along the U.S. border. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)\n\nHis friend Francisco Juarez disagrees.\n\n\"It's not only them, in Tijuana there's plenty of drugs anyway,\" Juarez says. \"They're not doing anything they're not supposed to. They've come here because they have needs, that's it.\"\n\nThis encapsulates the debate raging across Tijuana, as thousands of migrants have arrived in several large \"caravans\" \u2014 with many more on the way.\n\nI'd seen reports of rock-throwing Tijuana residents yelling at the migrants to go home, but I wanted to see for myself: just how widespread and how deep is the hostility?\n\nI was surprised at the number of people who told me they were angry that the migrants had showed up at their doorstep.\n\nPeople are always coming and going through Tijuana, like the thousands of Haitians who began arriving a year or so ago, Garcia says. But the sheer number right now seems to bother many, as does their conduct.\n\n\"The Haitians came quietly,\" Garcia says. \"These guys didn't.\"\n\nTijuana police say they have arrested a few dozen migrants for various offences.\n\nEven so, I didn't see any virulent hatred in the community. Indeed, one well-known anti-migrant activist called for protesters to show up at the toll booth leading into Tijuana where the next caravan was supposed to enter the city, but I waited there at the appointed time and no-one beyond a few other journalists showed up.\n\nAnd there's plenty of goodwill on display from Tijuana residents as well.\n\nOutside the baseball stadium that more than 1,000 recently arrived migrants now call home, a woman was handing out coffee and cups of frozen rice treats to migrants lined up along the street.\n\n\"There are only a few bad apples,\" she says.\n\nInside the stadium at the makeshift camp, it seems about half of the inhabitants are men under the age of 40 seeking work. The other half are families, many led by young mothers seeking a better life.\n\nSome members of migrant caravans that have arrived in Tijuana recently are being housed in tents and makeshift shelters at the community's baseball stadium. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)\n\nMost of those with whom I spoke weren't escaping any specific persecution, but were spurred north by the general poverty, unrest and violence endemic in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Few were able to articulate why the U.S. should let them in beyond the fact that, as many told me, they weren't troublemakers but rather \"hard workers.\"\n\nMigrant Wilmer Ramirez, however, had an interesting answer. He maintains the U.S. has a duty of care to Central American migrants because of environmental exploitation by the West.\n\n\"There are only African palm trees, palm trees, palm trees, palm trees\u2026,\" in Latin America, he says, which are used to make palm oil that's sent overseas by multinational corporations. \"And the palm trees are drying the earth.\"\n\nAnd then, he says, there is the issue of past neo-colonial wrongs inflicted on Latin America by previous Cold War-era American governments, which have supported various brutal regimes and have led to the current instability.\n\n\"It's the problem of the United States, because the U.S. brought this on our country. We don't own any of our land. They've invaded our land and now own it all.\"\n\nWilmer Ramirez, part of a migrant caravan that arrived recently in Tijuana, says the U.S. has a responsibility to help Latin Americans who seek asylum due to the damage its political and corporate activities have done to the region and its people. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)\n\nIt's not clear either of those arguments will sway U.S. border officials tasked with assessing their asylum claims.\n\nMany migrants I spoke with are still hoping U.S. president Donald Trump, who has gone to unprecedented and \u2014 according to a recent ruling, illegal \u2014 lengths to prevent the migrants from entering and claiming asylum status, will have a spontaneous and miraculous conversion.\n\n\"All of us here who walked here, [we] walked hoping that God would touch the heart of stone of Donald Trump,\" says migrant Nolvia Navarro.\n\nAnd if their asylum claims are denied?\n\nNo-one would tell me on the record that they'd try to cross illegally. But neither did any of them rule it out.\n\nWatch Kim Brunhuber's story on the migrants in Tijuana from The National:\n\nMigrants camped in Tijuana, Mexico, after travelling in a caravan to reach the U.S. are weighing their options after a California court blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's asylum ban Monday for people who cross the border illegally. 2:54\n\nBuyer beware\n\nSome funeral industry practices have changed but others haven't in the wake of a CBC News investigation, reporter David Common writes.\n\nWe'd heard enough complaints to know something was going on.\n\nCanadians who'd arranged a funeral and who were left feeling taken advantage of. People who'd paid way more than they had planned to and ended up buying things they neither wanted nor needed.\n\nWe first took our hidden cameras into the largest Canadian-owned funeral chain two years ago. What we found would disappoint Ontario's funeral regulator \u2014 and lead to new rules.\n\nThe commission-earning sales staff would push to upsell, and insisted that optional items \u2014 like embalming \u2014 were actually required. Caskets were marked up by as much as 400 per cent, but try to buy one cheaper at Costco or Amazon and the funeral chain would charge a $600 handling fee. Salespeople also refused to sell inexpensive caskets to our undercover producers, deeming them inappropriate.\n\nOntario's regulator was shocked when he saw the video. He asked for the outside handling fee to end and insisted all funeral homes sell any casket in their showroom to a customer.\n\nCBC News visited funeral homes in Ontario earlier this year with hidden cameras to see if changes had been made to sales operations in the wake of a 2017 investigation. (CBC)\n\nWe took our hidden cameras back inside five Arbor Memorial funeral homes in the Toronto area recently to see whether the new rules were being followed.\n\nAll five homes welcomed outside caskets. But at one, the salesperson repeatedly refused to sell a cheaper casket, even when the undercover team asked for a simple service with immediate cremation.\n\nSo we went back to the same regulator. And again, he was disappointed and promised action.\n\nArbor Memorial also responded to us saying it has significantly enhanced the training programs for its staff over the past year, and that its priority now is to listen to customers.\n\nAcross Canada, some funeral homes are using a business model where they charge a professional fee but don't make money from the products they sell. Want a gold plated oak casket, it's yours, and some homes will make no more than if they had sold you a plain pine box.\n\nBut at others, selling products as well as service is how they make a profit.\n\nThe lesson in all of this: arranging a funeral may be an unusual buying experience, but it's still a transaction between a customer and a business. And as a customer, you should be aware of how the salesperson is making money.\n\n- David Common\n\nWATCH: David Common's story about business practices at funeral homes tonight on The National on CBC Television and The National on CBC Television and streamed online\n\nA few words on ...\n\nA global cyber-vigil for a 95-year-old refugee advocate from Canada.\n\nQuote of the moment\n\n\"The conditions were terrible and that makes it a challenge to get good estimates of how many seabirds might be killed.

It's quick, hearty, inexpensive and a staple of kitchen tables around the world.\n\nYou may have grown up on old-old-fashioned, steel-cut oatmeal or those little packets of instant oats, congee, Cream of Wheat, Sunny Boy or Red River, which is a combination of wheat, rye and flax. A lot of us either love it or hate it now, as a result.\n\nWhile the term porridge may conjure images of oatmeal, it can refer to any number of grains: wheat, rye, barley, millet, rice or buckwheat. It's simmered and served soft or firm, sweet or savoury.\n\nFor more of Julie Van Rosendaal's tasty dishes, bookmark cbc.ca/juliesrecipes\n\nCongee, an Asian dish of rice boiled in stock, is savoury and comforting, with added ingredients ranging from shredded chicken or ground pork to scallions or crispy onions, fish sauce, sesame oil, soy sauce, chilies and the like.\n\nGame-changing recipe\n\nWhen it comes to oats, simmered on the stove with some cinnamon, I come from the camp that prefers a less stodgy bowl with more distinct, chewy grains.\n\nRobin, a Calgary Eyeopener listener, recently enlightened me to his oatmeal-making process, which was a game-changer.\n\nHe starts by browning the grains, seeds and nuts in a saucepan. He uses a blend of rolled oats and rolled barley, which has the same texture and flavour as oats, and adds any combination of nuts and seeds. He typically uses walnuts, sunflower and pumpkin seeds.\n\nWhen everything is sufficiently browned, he adds the water, a dab of butter, a little salt, spices. Robin suggests thinly sliced ginger and a cinnamon stick, chopped apple and/or raisins.\n\nBrowning oats in a cast iron pan with various nuts and seeds before boiling adds flavour and texture, says Calgary Eyeopener food columnist Julie van Rosendaal. (Julie Van Rosendaal/CBC)\n\nCover and simmer until it's done, about 10 minutes. Do this without stirring, just as you would a pot of rice.\n\nIt's done when the grains are soft and have absorbed all the water.\n\nWhen I did mine, I made it in the cast iron skillet that lives on my stovetop. By the time the grains, nuts and seeds had browned, which was quick with the large surface area of a skillet versus a saucepan, the heat of the pan made the added water come to a rollicking boil immediately.\n\nThe oats cooked through quickly and wound up like a soft, not sweet, granola that was delicious with milk and a drizzle of maple syrup. Robin's daughter upped the ante with saut\u00e9ed apples, added at the end.\n\nOur food guide shares some recipe ideas for sweet and savoury porridge. 9:00\n\nCongee\n\nTo make a bowl of savoury congee, aim for about \u00bd cup of short or medium-short grained rice added to six to eight cups of chicken stock. Simmer them together for a good hour or so, stirring often.\n\nCongee is a type of porridge typically prepared in an array of savoury flavours. (Julie Van Rosendaal/CBC)\n\nIt will thicken as the rice softens and starts to split and fall apart. The texture is even softer and soupier than risotto. It can be seasoned in much the same way you might spice up an Asian-flavoured chicken soup: with ginger, spring onion, chilies, cilantro, shredded chicken or cooked ground pork, fish sauce \u2014\u200b anything goes.\n\nPorridge in all its forms is a quick, affordable and comforting way to stay warm this winter.\n\nHear more from Julie Van Rosendaal and her adventures making porridge:\n\n\u200bWith files from the Calgary Eyeopener."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "B.C.

I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them,\" Staver said.\n\nStaver said Chau's last notes to his family on Nov. 16 told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School.

He also touted tax changes introduced in the fiscal update.\n\nTrudeau told Albertans he understands they are hurting, including from the price gap between West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian Select, which averaged around $45 US per barrel last month.\n\n\"There is no question that folks in Alberta, folks here in Calgary, are living through extremely difficult times.

The federal government bought Trans Mountain and its expansion project for $4.5 billion last summer only to have the Federal Court of Appeal strike down its approval, citing inadequate Indigenous consultation and failure to consider impacts on marine ecosystems.\n\nTrudeau said Alberta's economic challenges stem from a \"horrific confluence of events.\"\n\n\"There are many things that are beyond our control here, whether it's the refineries down for maintenance or whether it's what's happening overseas around oil prices or whether it's the fact that we are constrained and have been for a long time to sell 99 per cent of our oil to the U.S,\" he said.\n\n\"We are working very hard to change that.\"\n\n'Competitive edge'\n\nSpeaking at a Calgary Chamber of Commerce luncheon, Trudeau pointed to Wednesday's fiscal update, which included a measure that lets companies write off capital expenditures more quickly.\n\nThat, combined with another tax benefit related to asset depreciation, will help businesses, he said.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to the Chamber of Commerce in Calgary, Alta., on Thursday.

Since then, she has been transported on a near-daily basis by ambulance to the Victoria General's Dickson centre for radiation treatments.\n\nIn the last week, she has also suffered a fractured rib. Her daughter, Lovessa Johnson, blames the ambulance trips for the injury and the resulting pain her mother has suffered.\n\n\u200b\"If she was over there, this fractured rib may not have happened,\" said Lovessa, the eldest of Mildred's three daughters, in an emotional interview on the sidewalk outside Dartmouth General on Wednesday.\n\n\"It's drained so much energy and strength out of her that she needs to fight back against this disease,\" Lovessa said.\n\n'A very fragile state'\n\nBefore she broke her rib, Mildred was having increasing difficulty breathing and a chest tube was required to drain fluid from her lung.\n\nLovessa said her mother has been in so much pain after the rib injury, and her condition was so unstable that her radiation treatment was cancelled on Wednesday. She has been transferred to the intensive care unit at Dartmouth General.\n\n\"That trip has put my mother in a very fragile state,\" Lovessa said.\n\nShe has nothing but praise for the doctors and nurses at Dartmouth General, but said her mother needs to be in Halifax under the same roof as cancer specialists.\n\nThe Nova Scotia Health Authority is unable to confirm patient details due to confidentiality.\n\nMildred Johnson retired from her job as a public servant in New Glasgow, N.S., just last year. (Submitted by Lovessa Johnson)\n\nFamily told no beds available\n\nLovessa said her mother should have been moved to a bed at the Victoria General last Friday after her first transfer there for an MRI test. She said doctors at Dartmouth General tried to make that arrangement because cancer treatments and follow-up tests were to be done in Halifax, but doctors told her no beds were available.\n\nLovessa said she spoke to a worker in the patient relations office on Tuesday who again informed her that no beds were available at the Victoria General. But she was told her mother would be moved after two biopsies pinpointed her exact form of what is suspected to be a blood cancer. The first biopsy is scheduled for this Friday.\n\nShe said that explanation makes no sense.\n\n\"If they don't have a bed available now, how are they going make a bed available once the diagnosis is here?\" Lovessa said.\n\n1 empty bed in radiation oncology\n\nThe medical director of Nova Scotia's cancer care program, Dr. Drew Bethune, could not comment on the specifics of Mildred Johnson's case.\n\nBut he said there are five beds in the radiation oncology unit \u2014 and there is currently one available bed.\n\nDr. Drew Bethune is a thoracic surgeon and has been the medical director of the Nova Scotia Cancer Care Program since 2016. (Elizabeth Chiu/CBC)\n\nBethune said in the past there were an additional five beds for patients who had other health problems and for whom radiation was \"not their major problem.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that it is not ideal to shuttle cancer patients with other health problems back and forth from the Victoria General for treatment.\n\nHowever, Bethune said patients who do not have a \"dominant, simple radiotherapy problem\" are best cared for in a setting where there are various different experts, and where there is a lead responsible for their clinical care.\n\nHe added caring for cancer patients with more complex needs is currently under review.\n\n\"I believe that revising how we're looking at this patient group is very important for quality of care and safety of patients,\" he said.\n\nHe said it's a very urgent concern, and that hearing from patients will inform the design of the new cancer centre that will eventually replace the Dickson Centre as part of the QEII redevelopment project.\n\n\"We will be able to plan for all the services to be together on one site. It will make a big difference,\" Bethune said.\n\n'We've had no support whatsoever'\n\nWith that new cancer centre still several years away from becoming reality, the Johnson family is frustrated with the support their mother has received in the past week.\n\nLovessa Johnson said her mother needs to be moved to the Victoria General now \u2014 and is speaking out, in part, because there's no cancer patient navigator in the city to assist patients. They exist in rural zones of the Nova Scotia Health Authority.\n\nAccording to the NSHA website, cancer patient navigators guide patients and families through the cancer care system, provide support, and work with members of the health care team to coordinate tests and visits for cancer treatment.\n\n\"There's no cancer patient navigator here, she's had no one come from social work to talk to her about her diagnosis. We've had no support whatsoever,\" said Lovessa.\n\nLovessa Johnson called her mother, Mildred, 'our rock' and she and her sisters are hoping for a bed at the Victoria General Hospital so Mildred won't have to endure more ambulance trips.

It does take two to tango.\n\nSo if there has been an unresolvable issue in the partnership, then it's likely not completely one-sided.\n\n'Committed' to vision\n\nStill, look at how Melnyk has talked about this project in the past year.\n\nLast December, before the outdoor game in Ottawa, Melnyk angered fans by taking a shot at them for not buying tickets and saying that \"it wouldn't be a disaster for us at all if LeBreton didn't happen.\"\n\nMelnyk can say, as he did in a statement sent out late Thursday afternoon, that he's \"championed a downtown sports and entertainment arena, and this important civic project, since initiating our proposal in 2014.\"\n\nBut the news clips say otherwise.\n\nHis statement this week says that the Senators continue \"to be committed to making our vision a reality.\"\n\nAnd yet in April, at a Senators town hall, he said that the team had \"stabilized\" in Kanata and mused that perhaps they didn't need a downtown rink after all.\n\n\"Why are we moving? Are we moving to be closer to the very people that cannot get tickets, or won't buy tickets?\" he asked.\n\nIf this is the sort of thing Melnyk will say in public about a project he's supposed to be championing, then how is he behaving behind closed doors?\n\nConstant mediation\n\nThat outburst led Mayor Jim Watson to tell reporters that he was going to demand to know whether Melnyk was serious about the project.\n\nThe mayor also alluded Thursday to having had to play referee between Melnyk and Ruddy.\n\nMayor Jim Watson and Senators owner Eugene Melnyk held a confidential meeting in August to discuss next steps in the process to develop LeBreton Flats. (Laura Osman, CBC)\n\nWatson said a \"challenging relationship\" existed between the two and that he hoped they could get to a place where it wasn't necessary to be \"constantly mediating between the two partners.\"\n\nAccording to sources, negotiations took a turn for the worse after Melnyk fired well-respected Cyril Leeder as president of the franchise in early 2017.\n\nEven the NCC's CEO appeared to confirm this theory, when he talked about the \"changing cast of characters in this project,\" and mentioned how the process started with Leeder, \"who we admire and who was a great leader.\"\n\nKristmanson offered no glowing descriptions \u2014 or descriptions of any kind \u2014 on other folks in the negotiations.\n\nThe National Capital Commission laid down an ultimatum yesterday to the two men leading the group to re-develop Lebreton Flats. Interview with the CEO of the NCC Mark Kristmanson followed by our municipal panel. 15:25\n\nFailed deal could be for the best\n\nThis isn't over.\n\nThe NCC vows to move forward with a new vision for LeBreton Flats.\n\nAnd Rendezvous LeBreton has two months to fix this.\n\nBut given that Melnyk and Ruddy have been partners for a few years, it's hard to see how a few more weeks will help them.\n\nIf the deal falls apart, it'll be a major disappointment for thousands of Ottawans.\n\nBut it also may be for the best.\n\nThis was supposed to a transformative project, estimated to be worth $4 billion.\n\nSure, there was supposed to be a downtown arena, but there was also a plan for 4,000 residential units \u2014 including affordable housing \u2014 a Sensplex, community centre for people with disabilities, a French public school, shopping and vast, creative public spaces, all on a 21-hectare downtown site served by two LRT stations.\n\nThis process is the closest we've been to creating a new downtown community, more than 50 years after the federal government razed the community that existed on the flat.\n\nBut are these the people to bring us this new vision?\n\nThe mayor was right when he said that, as a city, \"we cannot have a dysfunctional partnership construct and build this site over the next 10 to 20 years.\"\n\nIf the partners of Rendezvous LeBreton can't get along with each other, trusting them with this special piece of Ottawa looks like a bad bet.\n\nMaybe their own dysfunction will mean this is one gamble we won't be called upon to make."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Matthew Low", "title": "Haven't voted in the electoral reform referendum yet?

The National Energy Board reported Wednesday exports reached about 270,000 bpd in September.\n\nFederal finance \u200bMinister Bill Morneau told reporters Thursday in Ottawa that the Liberal government has no plans to introduce new measures to boost oil-by-rail shipments.\n\nNotley added her government is close to finalizing investment deals on six projects for partial upgrading of oilsands bitumen that will be worth nearly $5 billion of new private sector investment and create hundreds of long-term jobs.\n\n\"For decades, Albertans have been talking about getting more for our oil by upgrading more here at home. We're taking action to make that a reality,\" Notley said in a release, shortly before repeating the message in Calgary Thursday at a meeting of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors (CAODC).\n\n\"By supercharging energy upgrading in Alberta, we can create more jobs and open more markets to finally get top dollar for our resources,\" said Notley, a day after Morneau released a fiscal update that the Alberta government said contained no specific measures to address the impact the oil price differential is having on the national economy.\n\nThe projects are being pursued under the Energy Diversification Act, introduced in March 2018, which earmarked up to $1 billion in incentives to help leverage billions more in private investment to build partial upgrading facilities.\n\nThe government says it's still reviewing the short list of proposed projects for their economic viability.\n\n\"We'll be sitting down with those companies very shortly and expect big investment decisions soon,\" Notley said.\n\nPartial upgrading reduces the thickness of oilsands bitumen so it flows through pipelines more easily, without having to be blended with diluent.\n\nIt can increase pipeline capacity by up to 30 per cent, the province says.\n\nCarbon levy exemption for drilling\n\nNotley also announced \u2014 to one of the biggest rounds of applause in the room \u2014 that drillers will be exempt from the provincial carbon levy for clear fuel usage for on-site drilling. She said they would be also be eligible for rebates going back to when the carbon levy began at the start of 2017.\n\nThe premier's office says the government estimates the rebates to drillers will add up to between $775,000 and $1.5 million a year.\n\nThe Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors released its drilling forecast for 2019 just ahead of the premier's speech.\n\nThe association is projecting that 6,962 wells will be drilled, an increase of just 51 from this year \u2014 a relatively flat year-over-year uptick, the association says.\n\nThe industry drilled about 13,000 wells in 2014 before global oil prices crashed.\n\nThe CAODC predicts the overall rig fleet to decrease by 58 next year, down to 522 actively drilling from 580.\n\n\"The lack of activity is not hard to understand,\" said CAODC president Mark Scholz. \"The Canadian oil and gas industry is simply too dysfunctional to anticipate any kind of quick recovery.\"\n\nNotley has been busy making announcements this week as part of her government's so-called made-in-Alberta strategy to get more value for the province's energy resources.\n\nThe price of Western Canadian Select crashed in September due, in part, to a backlog of oil in Alberta.\n\nAs oilsands production ramped up throughout the year, export pipelines reached full capacity. Making matters worse, several refineries in the U.S. that process heavy oil from Alberta shut down for maintenance.\n\nThe differential between West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian Select averaged around $45 US per barrel last month. One estimate pegged the cost of the price differential to Alberta's energy sector at $100 million a day.\n\nPipelines preferred over rail shipments\n\nAsked about the rail request, Morneau said pipelines are his preference, vowing to continue to push to build the Trans Mountain expansion.\n\nHowever, a government official speaking on background said if there were industry and government consensus on a new approach, Morneau would assess how to move forward.\n\nNotley said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would likely hear a great deal of frustration as he visited Calgary on Thursday to give a speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce and meet with oil and gas company CEOs.\n\n\"There are a lot of folks here who would be forgiven for saying, 'Gee, if there were this kind of economic crisis going on in the manufacturing sector in Ontario, we're pretty sure it would make its way into the first two paragraphs of the fiscal update.' Yet it didn't find its way into the first two paragraphs,\" she told reporters.\n\n\"I think that Ottawa needs to be seized of the matter and I suspect they will be by the end of the prime minister's day here today.\"\n\nCenovus CEO calls for production cuts\n\nAlex Pourbaix, president and CEO of Cenovus Energy, told CBC News Network's Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos that ramping up oil-by-rail is an important part of the solution to the crisis, but it's more complicated than some people realize.\n\n\"The cars are a bottleneck, but it's not just cars. It's crews, it's locomotives, it's the upgrades that CN and CP need to do to their tracks in order to accommodate these increased freight movements,\" he said Thursday.\n\nCenovus has been urging the Alberta government to implement \"temporary\" production cuts across the oil sector as Canadian crude prices continue to struggle.\n\nCenovus says there is a strong case for the government to temporarily mandate reduced production for the industry since the market can't fix a problem that is \"inherently political.\"\n\n\"By any measure, this has become an extraordinarily serious situation. And we, our industry, Albertans and Canadians, are losing money or value every day that this issue is not resolved.\"\n\nBut he said the government seems to be moving with \"pretty good speed\" to address the crisis.\n\nPourbaix said that, assuming that the Enbridge Line 3 project comes about next year, and that rail ramps up, the current crisis will be alleviated and the government wouldn't need to curtail production for very long.\n\nNew provincial investments\n\nOn Tuesday, Notley unveiled a plan to boost its investment in two petrochemical upgrading programs by $1.1 billion, for a total of $2.1 billion.\n\nShe also announced a new \"energy upgrading unit\" in her office to prioritize the upgrading and refining of more of Alberta's energy resources within the province, and said funding announcements were expected within days.\n\nOn Monday, the premier said she has appointed three special envoys to work with energy sector experts and CEOs to find solutions for closing the oil-price differential.\n\nThe envoys are Robert Skinner from the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy, Brian Topp, Notley's former chief of staff, and deputy energy minister Coleen Volk."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "After years of financial struggle, Avalanche Canada gets $25M boost from Ottawa", "description": "The federal money, a one-time endowment for 2018-2019, was announced during Finance Minister Bill Morneau's fall update.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/avalanche-canada-25m-boost-ottawa-1.4915864", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4480121.1515540074!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/alavanche-death.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T14:46:13Z", "content": "Avalanche Canada, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving avalanche awareness and safety, has been promised $25 million in funding from the federal government, ending years of financial struggle.

Pam, who does not want to use her last name for fear of further harming her family, said her daughter did not. She died by suicide 10 months after a tubal ligation at a Winnipeg hospital in 2009.\n\nPam said her daughter believed having the procedure would result in getting her other children back, out of foster care.\n\n\"I guess I can say she was bullied to death,\" Pam said. She's obtained medical records to learn more about the circumstances surrounding the procedure and the involvement of child-welfare workers.\n\nThere could have been a different outcome for Pam's daughter, said Cora Morgan, a family advocate with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs.\n\n'Blackmailing women'\n\nPeople who've allowed these procedures, or carried them out, must be held accountable, and future instances prevented, she said.\n\nMorgan said she's heard several stories from Indigenous women who also say they were encouraged to abort pregnancies because they had other children in foster care.\n\n\"Their social worker is giving them instructions to abort their baby in exchange for being able to get their children back or get more access to their children,\" Morgan said.\n\n\"They're basically blackmailing women into having abortions.\"\n\nMorgan believes more Indigenous women would come forward to share their stories if they had a formal outlet, a place to tell them.\n\nFor her part, Mercredi said she repressed her own story for four decades until she heard a radio broadcast featuring women from the Saskatoon Health Region who said they had been coerced into sterilizations.\n\nAbout 60 women have now joined a proposed class action lawsuit led by Maurice Law, an Indigenous-owned national law firm, that lists the government of Saskatchewan, the Saskatoon Health Authority, the federal government and medical professionals as defendants in its statement of claim.\n\nAlisa Lombard, an associate with the firm, said that since The Canadian Press published a story about the issue last week, her practice has heard from more than 32 women who also say they were sterilized without their consent.\n\n\"I think that it is troubling that everyone would not be as concerned as some of us are and committed to making sure that vulnerable women, at their most vulnerable, wouldn't have the very basic, standard protection that most people take for granted,\" Lombard said Wednesday.\n\nAt 55, Mercredi said, she's now strong enough to fight for her 14-year-old self who had no one.\n\nShe also hopes Indigenous women who have endured the trauma of sterilization will not isolate themselves in anguish.\n\n\"Put your tobacco down,\" she said. \"The ancestors are with us. Grandmothers are with us and it is time for us now.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "British intelligence 'moved too slowly' on tracking Manchester bomber, report says", "description": "A major British parliamentary report found that security services shortcomings led to missed opportunities to possibly prevent last year's lethal extremist attack at Manchester Arena.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/british-report-abedi-manchester-1.4915929", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915994.1542894900!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/britain-manchester-arena-terrorist-attack-aftermath.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T14:28:21Z", "content": "A major British parliamentary report found Thursday that shortcomings by security services led to missed opportunities to possibly prevent last year's lethal extremist attack at Manchester Arena.

The Jets were 12-5-3 after 20 games a year ago.\n\nWinnipeg Jets' Brandon Tanev, right, celebrates his goal with teammate Adam Lowry, 15 seconds into the first period. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)\n\nUnless you're Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins, who won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2015-16 and 2016-17, it's not easy to follow up a good playoff run with another.\n\nOf the final four teams that advanced to the conference finals six months ago, only the Tampa Bay Lightning at 15-6-1 has a better record than the Jets at this point. The Stanley Cup-champion Washington Capitals are at 11-7-3 and the Vegas Golden Knights, the team that defeated the Jets in the West final, have struggled at 10-12-1.\n\nPlenty to like\n\nThere has been plenty to like about the Jets' first quarter. The young core of Mark Scheifele, Patrik Laine, Kyle Connor and Josh Morrissey continues to develop.\n\nA capable backup has been found in Laurent Brossoit. Adam Lowry has become one of the top faceoff men in the league.\n\nThe Jets have strong leadership with captain Blake Wheeler. Their league-leading power play continues to hum.\n\nThey also are third in goals against at 2.47 per game, but a middling 14th in goals scored per game at 3.21 and 14th in penalty-killing efficiency.\n\nMaurice would like to see his team's defensive play tighten up somewhat before the playoffs roll around and taking too many penalties continues to be a problem. But the Jets have time on their side to work out the kinks.\n\nThe pressing matter is whether general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff can make a move or two to improve his team's depth in the next few months.\n\nEven though the Jets have a young team, the window to win is small in the NHL these days, especially with second contracts for young stars becoming so steep.\n\nThe Jets will have several players in this situation in the summer, including Laine, Connor, Jacob Trouba and Andrew Copp. Also slated to become unrestricted free agents are Tyler Myers, Ben Chiarot and Tanev.\n\nU.S. Thanksgiving Day marks a time in the season when general managers take stock of their roster. With Finnish rookie Kristian Vesalainen on his way home to complete the season with Jokerit, the roster is close to the one that advanced to the West final last spring.\n\nThe key absentee is centre Paul Stastny, whom Cheveldayoff pulled off a trade for with the St. Louis Blues at the deadline last February. He gave up a first-round draft pick and 2020 conditional fourth-round selection as well as prospect Erik Foley, who suffered a concussion at the Blues rookie tournament and has yet to play this fall.\n\nEven though Laine has found his groove on the second line alongside Bryan Little and Connor, presumably Cheveldayoff would like to add more depth down the middle.\n\nThe Jets have salary cap space to add another top-shelf centre. Like a lot of teams, they will touch base with the Ottawa Senators about the asking price for centre Matt Duchene, eligible to become an unrestricted free agent in the summer.\n\nDuchene is having a bountiful season with Ottawa and the price will be high to pry him away.\n\nBut as Edmonton Oilers GM Peter Chiarelli stated earlier this week, when he decided to make a coaching change, there still is plenty \"of runway left in this year.\"\n\nThere still is plenty of runway for the Jets to work on their game and plan potential moves for their roster."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Western University kit could have stopped E. coli-contaminated lettuce from hitting store shelves - CBC.ca", "description": "CBC.ca Western University kit could have stopped E. coli-contaminated lettuce from hitting store shelves CBC.ca A new rapid testing kit developed by researchers at Western University on London, Ont. could have detected E. coli in romaine lettuce long before s\u2026", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/western-university-e-coli-rapid-testing-kit-1.4915923", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4914779.1542894824!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ont-lettuce-outbreak-20181121.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T14:00:53Z", "content": "A new rapid testing kit developed by researchers at Western University on London, Ont. could have detected E. coli in romaine lettuce long before shipments hit grocery shelves.

In addition, the Alberta Energy Regulator in 2017 did not meet the deadline for reporting damages to the assets it oversees, meaning hundreds of strikes were not counted. There were more than 4,000 recorded instances in Alberta in 2016.\n\nThose numbers \u2014 and the increasing reliance on Internet connectivity \u2014 are driving a push for provincial legislation that would make it mandatory for anyone digging near utilities to call for an underground line location service, and for utility owners to register their assets with the Alberta One Call corporation.\n\n\"From a political point of view, our people were just up and arms,\" Castle said about service disruptions to his town.

Our crews are on-site working as quickly & safely as possible to repair the line. \u2014@ATCOGas In Edmonton last week, some Mill Woods residents were evacuated from their homes after a gas leak near 37th Avenue and Mill Woods Road. ATCO has confirmed the incident was related to a contractor who hit a gas line while doing directional drilling in the area.\n\nIn that same neighbourhood, 40 years ago, a serious hit to a high-pressure pipeline line forced 18,000 people from their homes. An excavator nicked a pipeline, then sparks from a delivery truck ignited propane vapour, causing an explosion, according to a local newspaper article at the time.\n\nWatch: The original news report on the explosion from March 2, 1979\n\nOn March 2, 1979, a gas explosion causes more than 15,000 people to be evacuated from the Edmonton neighbourhood. 1:42\n\nThat kick-started the formation of Alberta One Call, the non-profit organization that collects line location data from almost 800 members, said Mike Sullivan, who heads the non-profit corporation.\n\n\"Back 20 years ago, we weren't relying anywhere near the amount on the telecommunications that we are today,\" he said. \"Before it was pipelines and things that go boom in the night [that made people worried].\"\n\nLegislative changes have made it mandatory for nationally and provincially monitored pipelines to register with Alberta One Call, meaning their line locations are on file. These days, telecommunications lines get hit almost as often as natural gas lines.\n\n\"There's so much reliance on telecommunications for banking, financial interactions, services like 911 ... it's not Mrs. Jones not catching her soaps in the afternoon anymore. People can be dramatically affected, or even die.\"\n\nAlberta One Call is meant to be the first point of contact for people who want to dig. The organization maps line location information provided by members, then alerts the utilities that might be affected by a dig. Those companies then mark their buried infrastructure before digging starts. Almost two-thirds of utilities in Alberta are registered with the organization.\n\nWatch: Adam Grossberndt explains the difficulties in line locating\n\nAdam Grossberndt advocates for new legislation in Alberta that would require builders to notify a registry before they dig. 1:27\n\nBut the Canadian Common Ground Alliance found that in 51 per cent of cases where damage was recorded, diggers didn't call for line information in the first place.\n\n\"There has been millions and millions of dollars spent on public awareness and education,\" Sullivan said.\n\n\"I think we've gotten as far as we possibly can after 34 years of One Call in Alberta, and all of the effort we've made to ensure people do the right thing. Legislation is going to take us to the end zone.\"\n\nOntario is the only province with what Sullivan calls \"comprehensive legislation,\" which mandates both utility owners to register with Ontario One Call and builders to call to request \"line locates\" before they dig. He said pressure has been mounting on the Alberta government in the past few years to implement something similar, with organizations such as the Rural Municipalities of Alberta also calling for the change.\n\n'Records are not always accurate'\n\nMeanwhile, others are calling for better training for line locators, based on the increasing complexity of the underground network.\n\nAdam Grossberndt, regional manager for Alberta Hotline, wants to see improved training for line locators. (Trevor Wilson/CBC)\n\n\"Locating is an art and a science and, in my opinion, it's not for everyone,\" said Adam Grossberndt, regional manager for Alberta Hot Line, a line location company.\n\n\"Records are not always accurate; they're not always up to date. There are many years of infrastructure in Edmonton \u2014probably close to 100 \u2014 where there's a lot of things that never made it to records, that people don't know about it.\"\n\nHe thinks line locating needs to be a recognized trade in the province, and that those providing the service need more training.\n\nGrossberndt's company has been called to do line location work during construction of the Valley LRT line. On that project, according to Trans Ed, there have been some buried utilities that were not as deep as records indicated.\n\n\"We proceed cautiously at all times because we are not permitted to rely on past records,\" said Trans Ed spokeswoman Sue Hueman. \"We recognize that Edmonton has been in existence for many years and some of the buried utilities were installed during times when construction standards and record keeping was not as advanced as it is today.\"\n\nGrossberndt thinks people need to recognize the potential danger of any strike to an underground utility.\n\n\"Yes, gas is very imminently dangerous, and a high enough voltage of power is instant death for somebody.

So where will we put everyone?\n\nCalgary's Municipal Development Plan (MDP) has set an ambitious target that 50 per cent of all population growth between 2009 and 2069 should happen in established communities, rather than new suburbs.\n\nYikes. That means adding 650,000 people to our existing neighbourhoods.\n\nA noble goal. But it will be very difficult.\n\nThis isn't some academic exercise, either. We all have skin in this game. The MDP is our roadmap for shaping the kind of city we want to live in. It affects roads and transit planning. It affects your taxes. It determines what gets built in your neighbourhood. It impacts our collective carbon footprint.\n\nSome say you have to set stretch goals if you want to make significant changes. But city planners admit progress in achieving the MDP goals has been mixed. While infill development has been on the rise, it hasn't been enough to offset population loss in some communities. Other communities that were once on the decline, however, are now seeing positive population growth.\n\nBut demographic trends still generally tend to favour population growth in the suburbs.\n\nSo hitting those targets \u2014 and limiting Calgary's sprawl \u2014 will be a herculean task.\n\n10,000 more people each year\n\nConsider what needs to happen for Calgary to accommodate 650,000 new people in established communities.\n\nVia infill, new build, rebuild and other projects, we'd need to make room for about 10,000 more residents per year, every year, for six straight decades.\n\nThink about that.\n\nCalgary's East Village community is expected to have about 10,000 residents by the time it's fully built. So we're talking about adding one East Village \u2014 every year \u2014 to our already-developed neighbourhoods.\n\nThis was the path Calgary set itself upon when the MDP was adopted back in 2009. That was a different time for our city \u2014 pre-downturn \u2014 but still, it's the vision we're using as we move forward.\n\nThe city's mid-term target is for 33 per cent of the cumulative population growth by 2039 to happen in established communities.\n\nThis would mark a radical change from the past decade or so, when more than 90 per cent of Calgary's growth happened in suburbs, and only 9.7 per cent in what the city calls the \"developed area,\" which is no small chunk of the city.\n\nThe \"developed area\" encompasses most of Calgary's existing footprint. And still, the vast majority of growth has come at the peripheries.\n\nThe 'developed area,' indicated in dark grey, actually lost population between 2006 and 2011. By 2017 it accounted for 9.7% of cumulative growth since 2006. The city's goal is for that to reach 33% by 2039 and 50% by as early as 2069. (City of Calgary)\n\nTo see the developed area's share of population growth go from 9.7 per cent now to 33 per cent by 2039 \u2014 and 50 per cent by 2069 \u2014 is going to mean a paradigm shift in how Calgarians live.\n\nThe city would need to devote considerably more time and tax dollars to making the inner-city communities a more attractive and affordable place to \"live, work and play\" than it has ever done before.\n\nThis will mean new, mid-rise condos along major transit routes and the conversion of old shopping centres, churches and schools into mixed-use developments. Think Stadium Shopping Centre, the new Kensington Legion or Westbrook Village (on the old Ernest Manning High School site) happening in almost every inner-city community.\n\nA rendering of the future vision for Westbrook Village from the city's redevelopment plan for the area. (City of Calgary)\n\nThis will require huge investments in things like bus rapid transit, bike lanes, public spaces, parks and recreational facilities.\n\nIt will also mean finding land, conducting complex public engagements and gaining community approvals to complete infrastructure upgrades and build 250,000 new homes.\n\nHow this mega-makeover would happen is complicated. There are many factors at play.\n\nWhere people are born and where they die\n\nBack to that 9.7-per-cent figure.\n\nDespite thousands of infill homes and hundreds of new condo buildings that have gone up in developed neighbourhoods over the past decade, these existing communities still only account for that small fraction of Calgary's recent growth.\n\nHow is this possible? Get ready for some math.\n\nIt probably shouldn't surprise anyone, but the older suburbs are where the older Calgarians live. A quick check of the City of Calgary's community profiles reveals, for example, that 22 per cent of the population in Lake Bonavista is over the age 65. In Lakeview, it's 20 per cent. In Acadia and Silver Springs, 17 per cent.\n\nNew communities like Aspen Woods, Bridlewood, Evanston and Auburn Bay, meanwhile, have five per cent (or less) of their population over 65.\n\nSo, you'll find more grey hair, like mine, in the middle-ring suburbs. Those are communities typically built between 1950 and 2000.\n\nNow, for the morbid part.\n\nOn average, Calgary sees about 7,500 of its residents die each year. Unfortunately, the city doesn't track deaths by community. However, it's reasonable to expect that more deaths occur in the developed areas than the developing ones.\n\nLikewise, we can expect different birth rates in Calgary's established communities versus the new ones.\n\nAgain, there's no precise record of how the roughly 17,000 babies born each year are distributed throughout the city. But those same community profiles that show a greater share of older residents in older communities also show significantly more young children in the new communities at the edges of the city.\n\nIn addition, established communities are more likely to have older teens and young adults who will be moving out of the house.\n\nSo, when it comes to population growth, it's not a fair fight.\n\nThe playing field is tilted toward the new suburbs, making it an uphill battle for the already-developed communities.\n\nTwo steps forward, one step back\n\nCalgary's new suburbs have seen population growth each and every year since 2006 but, in the existing communities, it's been more like two steps forward, one step back.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2009 there was virtually no net change in population. In 2010, the population declined in the wake of the global financial crisis. That was followed by a period of strong growth from 2011 to 2015. But then it was back to declines again in 2016 and 2017.\n\nDeveloped communities have gone through periods of population loss, especially during economic downturns, while new suburbs have seen more and more people arrive every year for the past decade. (Andrew Lupton/CBC)\n\nThis back-and-forth has put the city off track for hitting its medium-term goal for growth.\n\nDespite some \"positive growth in strategic areas,\" senior city planner Denise Carbol says \"it is not yet at the level the plans intended.\"\n\nA city report quantifies the challenge, noting that to reach the cumulative growth target of 33 per cent by 2039, approximately 47 per cent the growth between now and then will need to be captured annually in the developed areas.\n\nIn other words, we're already off pace \u2014 and the pace will only accelerate in the coming years.\n\nIf that's not enough, there's yet another hurdle standing in the way.\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nRemember: most land in established communities is, by definition, already built on.\n\nSo, how does the city expect developers to go about amassing sufficient land to construct the 250,000 or so new homes that will be needed to accommodate the 650,000 more people the city expects to live there by 2069?\n\nOne option, of course, is to go up.\n\nBuild tall towers on small plots of land.\n\nIf the past is any guide, however, developers and city planners are going to face stiff opposition to large-scale projects in established communities, given the increasing complications of community engagement and infrastructure upgrades that are required.\n\nThe controversy and delays surrounding the Highland Park Golf Course and Kensington Legion developments are good examples of how messy this process can be.\n\nBut let's say we do build up.\n\nThat, too, presents financial challenges.\n\nSome people assume infill projects are \"free\" for the city, as they don't require new roads, LRT lines or police and fire stations to be built. This is not exactly true.\n\nMore people means more pressure on old infrastructure, which comes with a cost.\n\nFor example, the city is spending $44 million on upgrades along 17th Avenue S.W. to make it more attractive for future business and residential development. To accommodate future development in Forest Lawn, the city is devoting $96 million to bus rapid transit to better connect the communities along International Avenue (17th Avenue S.E.) to the city centre, as well as to create a more pedestrian-friendly experience.\n\nAnd then there's East Village, where the city has invested mega-millions on new infrastructure, a new library, museum, public art, community garden, dog park and the redevelopment of St. Patrick's Island Park.\n\nCalgarians lined up to take in the newly opened Central Library on Nov. 1, 2018. (Dave Dormer/CBC)\n\nIf we are going to put 650,000 more people into our existing communities, they are going to want more amenities. Plunking down 10,000 new residents next to a small library or an old community centre will come with increased demands for better \"stuff.\"\n\nBut even if there is a commitment to redeveloping older neighbourhoods \u2014 and we come up with the money for the amenities \u2014 there's another cost that will make growth in established communities difficult.\n\nThe cost of the actual homes, themselves.\n\nAffordability issues\n\nMost Calgarians today simply can't afford homes in established communities.\n\nThink of it this way. In the suburbs, a nice single-family home can easily cost $500,000, but that's to buy it lock, stock and barrel. In developed communities \u2014 especially in the inner city \u2014 the lot, alone, can cost $500,000.\n\nYes, we could try to focus on replacing houses with condos when redeveloping older neighbourhoods, but the cost of a condo can still be twice as much in the inner city compared to the suburbs, especially if you're looking at a concrete building with underground parking.\n\nEven for more affordable housing types such as row houses and apartment-style condos, prices in the inner city tend to be higher than in the suburbs. (Zoocasa)\n\nIt will also take a huge shift in thinking to get Calgary families to adopt condos as a preferred way of living.\n\nSo, until the city and developers can find a way to build more affordable, high-density, infill housing, Calgarians will continue to gravitate to the city's new suburbs or even surrounding municipalities like Airdrie and Cochrane.\n\nBut there is some progress on that front.\n\nMore and more niche developers are building small row-housing projects or condo complexes that replace two or three mid-century homes. Many of our inner-city communities are now bustling with infills. The city centre is also full of cranes building high-rise residential towers.\n\nThe 2018 census showed a significant population increase in the downtown area and the communities that surround it.\n\nHowever, there was a decline in the older suburbs (between the inner-city ring and the new suburbs) that offset most of the growth in and around the city centre.\n\nThe evolution of mid-to-late-20th century communities from almost exclusively single-family homes to a substantial mix of housing types will take more than two generations, or roughly 60 years.\n\nInner-city communities like West Hillhurst, Bridgeland and Altadore have been experiencing infill development for more than 30 years, now, and only recently have their populations begun to grow beyond what they were in the 1960s.\n\nSo we're heading in the right direction, but we have a long, long way to go.\n\nAnd a lot to think about, in the meantime.\n\nLinking vision with reality\n\nAs we chart a path forward, it helps to have a plan that's in line with the realities we face.\n\nRhetoric and aspirational thinking can be dangerous While they can inspire, inform, encourage and energize us, they can also have the opposite effect when targets are not met.\n\nThat can jade the community and ultimately erode the power of words to motivate change. We must be careful of not setting impossible targets in the name of \"doing something\" about sprawl, environmentalism and economic development.\n\nThe intents of the MDP are good. There are lots of smart ideas and policies. But the targets need to be achievable.\n\nWe need to rethink the target of having 33 per cent of Calgary's population growth between 2009 and 2039 in established communities, and 50 per cent by 2069.\n\nA better target, perhaps, would be to achieve continuous improvement from the 9.7-per-cent growth we've seen to date. Or to split up the massive \"developed area\" and establish different goals for the city centre and older inner-city communities versus the the mid-to-late-20th century neighbourhoods \u2014 recognizing each has its own inherent opportunities for (and barriers to) diversification and densification.\n\nGood plans are not static.\n\nThe city recognizes this. Plans are afoot to review both the Municipal Development Plan and other planning documents in the next two years, and to update them with new initiatives and targets based on what we've learned over the past decade.\n\nAnd, yes, there will be an opportunity for community input.\n\nSo, let's all work together \u2014 politicians and planners, developers and the general public \u2014 to help the city manage Calgary's growth in a realistic manner that will curb our urban sprawl, once and for all.\n\nThis column is an opinion.

Dough is rolled out, layered and folded with butter.\n\nAfter frying it on a pan, the hot roti is quickly slapped together by hand to soften the roti and aerate the flaky roti. The texture is somewhat reminiscent of a French croissant, denser, but with pronounced buttery notes.\n\nAnother station was responsible for curries; there was a bone-in chicken curry with a deep layering of spices, and a shrimp curry made with coconut milk to give it a creamier texture.\n\nA shrimp curry made with coconut milk.

A publication ban has since been lifted, so the government has put out its version of events.\n\nBut the file itself is still sealed, meaning the public has no way to independently gauge a situation that has the makings of a major scandal. Remember \u2014 dozens of children.\n\nOr how about another case involving a bid by the Public Guardian and Trustee to take over the affairs of a young man who won a multi-million dollar settlement for abuse in the foster care system?\n\nAs the former representative for children and youth pointed out last week to CBC, court orders and publication bans are there to protect individuals. But we have to make sure they don't inadvertently shield authority from scrutiny.\n\nNo one wants to see an innocent person tried in the media. Just as no one wants to further victimize children who have already been let down by the system.\n\nThe right to be presumed innocent is sacrosanct. As is the need for the proper administration of justice.\n\nOne of the prosecutors in charge of the legislature investigation urged patience yesterday. The matter is being taken seriously.\n\nBut as Holman says, when it comes to the upholding of their rights, some people like proof \u2014 not just reassurance."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Katie Nicholson,Joanne Levasseur", "title": "'We dragged our heels' after sexual abuse allegations, foster care service director says in secret recording", "description": "A director with a for-profit Manitoba foster care company said he failed to act quickly enough after allegations of sexual abuse emerged in a home it oversees, according to a secret recording obtained by CBC News.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/b-and-l-foster-care-sexual-abuse-allegations-1.4915065", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915227.1542833575!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/child-s-drawing.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T11:00:00Z", "content": "A director with a for-profit Manitoba foster care company said he failed to act quickly enough after allegations of sexual abuse emerged in a home it oversees, according to a secret recording obtained by CBC News. \"We dragged our heels big time,\" the director\u2026 [+9094 chars]", "fulltext": "A director with a for-profit Manitoba foster care company said he failed to act quickly enough after allegations of sexual abuse emerged in a home it oversees, according to a secret recording obtained by CBC News.\n\n\"We dragged our heels big time,\" the director of foster care services for B & L Resources for Children, Youth and Families says in the 2017 recording.\n\n\"The damage is done and it has been ongoing for probably as long as the kids have been there,\" the director is heard saying in the recording.\n\nThey've failed to protect my family. - Parent of alleged victims\n\nAllegations emerged in 2016 that children were being sexually abused by a minor in one of the homes B & L oversees.\n\nThe company is paid millions each year by the province of Manitoba to provide foster care services.

(Submitted by Lindsay Martin)\n\nDelaney Coelho would be very happy to shut down the Manitoba organization she founded.\n\nBut for now, she says, there's a distinct need for Equal Voice Manitoba. It's the provincial chapter of a multi-partisan national network focused on supporting the participation of women in politics.\n\n\"There's a study out there \u2026 that says if things continue to go as they are, it's going to be another 50 years before we see anything remotely close to [gender] parity,\" in politics, Coelho said.\n\n\"I'm far too impatient for that. So the hope is that Equal Voice and organizations like Equal Voice can speed that up. I don't want to be 70 or 80 before parity is achieved.\"\n\nTo that end, Coelho, 30, founded Equal Voice Manitoba in 2016. It offers a range of programming for women interested in politics \u2014 either running as candidates themselves or working in roles such as campaign management. That includes full-day \"campaign schools\" that focus on tangible skills as well as networking.\n\nThe idea is to counter the under-representation of women in all levels of politics \u2014 something Coelho saw herself when she worked as a staffer for Manitoba's previous NDP government.\n\n\"In my experience, I'd often be \u2026 the only woman in the room, or be at events with ministers from across the country where there were no women or people of colour represented,\" said Coelho, who now works with Manitoba's Human Rights Commission.\n\nIt's completely unacceptable to have an environment where \u2026 51 per cent of the population is made to feel that they don't belong. - Delaney Coelho\n\n\"It definitely feels isolating \u2014 like maybe your perspective isn't being presented or if it is [kind of the burden is on your shoulders to be the only one to speak for all women.\"\n\nThat's a problem, she says, when \"obviously, women are pretty diverse in their perspectives and ideas, and if you're kind of the spokesperson for all women, that's maybe not the greatest fit.\"\n\nEqual Voice, she says, also has a role to play in fighting the harassment of women in politics \u2014 many instances of which have come to light in the wake of the #MeToo movement.\n\n\"One of the things we've tried to do is create a community in Manitoba, and more broadly, where people can speak up about these situations that are happening, and bring them \u2026 to the forefront. They've always been happening and continue to happen, but they maybe haven't been talked about,\" she said.\n\n\"And then also just creating a greater conversation about how, as the electorate, we're just not going to accept that any more. It's completely unacceptable to have an environment where \u2026 51 per cent of the population is made to feel that they don't belong.\"\n\nThe 2017 Daughters of the Vote event, organized by Equal Voice Canada, which brought together 338 young women from across Canada to represent their communities in the House of Commons for a day. 'Political institutions have been \u2026 male-dominated for a long time, and they're slow to change,' says Equal Voice Manitoba founder Delaney Coelho. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nThere are some signs of progress. In the most recent Manitoba municipal elections, for example, the number of female elected officials grew three per cent over 2014. Nevertheless, women fill just one-fifth of roles in Manitoba's municipal governments.\n\n\"The political institution was created without thinking of women's participation, because women could not run at that time,\" Coelho said.\n\n\"So there needs to kind of be a change in the system, but also just around the general conversation.\"\n\nThat can take time \u2014 but she hopes Equal Voice will help spur those conversations and speed the progress.\n\n\"Ideally, in five to 10 years, I would love to be able to dissolve Equal Voice because our mandate has been achieved,\" she said.\n\n\"But political institutions have been \u2026 male-dominated for a long time and they're slow to change, so it's obviously important that we stick around and kind of push to speed change up a little bit.\"\n\nFuture 40 finalist biographies and photos below were submitted by nominators.

That officer didn't serve any jail time because of a botched investigation.\n\nHer husband Robert Taman helped draw up the mandate for the IIU but later resigned because he felt there lacked civilian oversight.\n\n\"There's been a lot of time and effort and a lot of sweat and a lot of tears to make something work that is going to be to bring transparency to all of this and it just isn't happening and that's where the disappointment lies,\" he said.\n\nTaman said before he left a Winnipeg police officer had been hired to work for the police watchdog before he had even retired from the service.\n\n\"I thought that it was resembling what was currently in place, meaning police investigating police, and when I went into this whole thing my plan or agenda was to try and make sure there was more civilians doing investigations rather than police investigating police because it's been proven that doesn't work,\" said Taman.\n\nJustice Minister Cliff Cullen says the Police Services Act is currently under review and if there are calls for changes to the IIU, his government will consider them. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)\n\nJustice Minister Cliff Cullen says his government is prepared to make changes to the law if they are needed.\n\n\"We've indicated we're going to have a comprehensive review of that particular legislation. We're certainly open to looking at all aspects of that legislation as well. Obviously we want to make sure there is an effective, an efficient review process in place,\" said Cullen.\n\nOverall good co-operation, Smyth\n\nSmyth says the email exchanges between himself and the IIU's civilian director Zane Tessler might give the wrong impression of a breakdown in the relationship.\n\n\"What [the public doesn't] see is all the co-operation that goes on, on the dozens and dozens of other files that have gone on,\" he said.\n\nHe also said critical incidents, such as severe injuries or fatalities, always trigger automatic IIU investigations regardless of the circumstances and so the fact the agency is launching an investigation is not a gauge of misconduct.\n\n\"I think maybe people are assuming because IIU is there somebody's done something wrong and that's not the case. They're there to make sure that things were done appropriately,\" said Smyth.\n\nThe IIU did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Janani Whitfield", "title": "What happens when a digital writer tries a digital detox?

But I know attention wanes and within seconds, some of you will jump to something shinier, newer, prettier.\n\nYou and I, we share this in common \u2014 we live in this digital space together. We read, we scroll, we consume. We carry the world in our back pocket, and there's always something to demand our attention.\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm tired. I'm overwhelmed, and I need a break.\n\nAvoiding the cat-video rabbit hole\n\nI decide to take a page out of the book of University of Regina professor David Gerhard and his family. They'd been talking about tackling about what some call a \"no-screen November.\"\n\n\"We do spend a lot of time on our phones. We'd all be sitting around at dinner and poking around our screens,\" he tells me.\n\nOver the course of two weeks, I know for sure [my family has] had conversations that we wouldn't have if we were staring at a phone, instead of staring at each other. - David Gerhard\n\nGerhard pointed out it's a tough task to divorce ourselves completely from smartphones, when we use them for just about everything.\n\nThe challenge is to be intentional, to use the phone for what we need and then put it away rather than falling into a rabbit hole of funny cat videos.\n\n\"Over the course of two weeks, I know for sure [my family has] had conversations that we wouldn't have if we were staring at a phone, instead of staring at each other,\" Gerhard told me.\n\nWhat might my family learn from doing the same, I wondered. I joke that my husband's phone is a mistress that's impossible to compete with: she's sleek, infinitely knowledgeable and always gives him the latest sports scores and analysis. I often want to break her in half.\n\nThe first thing you might do in the morning and the last thing you may do at night is to check your phone. (Shutterstock)\n\n'The algorithm is us'\n\nMy family grumbled a bit about it at first, but they agreed to go along with the experiment \u2014 one week of \"intentional\" smartphone use, meaning for the entire week, we'd only turn to our phones when absolutely necessary. No cat videos and Candy Crush for us.\n\nThe irony is not lost on me. I'm a digital writer who depends on the web and an \"attention economy\" for a living.\n\nBut Gerhard points out that it's not content itself that is bad. It's how we engage with content. Social posts and news that are tension-filled or that drive conversation \u2014 but that also aggravate us \u2014 tend to get shared and commented on. Then we end up seeing more of it.\n\n\"We blame the algorithm, but the algorithm is us,\" said Gerhard.\n\nMaybe if we changed how we consumed social media and news \u2014 purposefully and intentionally, rather than constantly and voraciously \u2014we wouldn't feel so bombarded and we would get more out of it.\n\nIt's not always easy to give up screens. Playing board games at a bistro instead of watching TV backfired, with one or two sore losers. (Submitted photo)\n\nAnd what about friendships? My husband says he depends on his phone to maintain relationships with people who are far away.\n\nBut strangely, if your phone is good for maintaining relationships, why has its use been linked to sleep disruption, loneliness, anxiety, depression and even increased risk of suicide?\n\nThere are probably multiple reasons for this, but let's just take the example of a birthday.\n\nGerhard and I both had birthdays in November. I took five minutes to respond to messages on my phone, but Gerhard unapologetically tells me he simply ignored them, breezing right by without even making an obligatory Facebook post to say, \"Thank you for all the birthday messages!\"\n\nAn e-card sums up the lack of connection many feel in generic Facebook birthday wishes. 'If we're not careful, that connection becomes really surface,' David Gerhard says. (Someecards)\n\n\"It relates to how we feel the need to be connected,\" he said of these posts.\n\nBut does it, really? Can a 10-second throwaway birthday wish substitute for face-to-face interaction over overpriced coffee, or a phone call, or even a more heartfelt, personalized message?\n\nIt's not even close.\n\n\"If we're not careful, that connection becomes really surface,\" Gerhard points out.\n\nHow to go beyond surface\n\nIn a week of reducing phone use, I tried to go beyond the surface and forge personal, meaningful connections.\n\nMy husband and I survived without his mistress. We held hands and had honest conversations late into the night. My kids survived without gaming apps. And when we watched a movie, we enjoyed it together, laughing and crying together at the appropriate bits instead of watching with one eye on a social media feed or crushing virtual candies.\n\nAt the end of a busy, active weekend, my youngest lay on my lap and drifted off to sleep. My mind was in a different space. I didn't feel anxiety or that hyperactive need to look at my phone to see what was new or what I should do next.\n\nI just sat there, aware of her warmth, of every shade of gold in her hair, of her delicate features and her eyelashes fluttering to a close.\n\nI didn't feel the need to reach for a phone and capture the moment, or hashtag it, #Adorable #MyWorld #Love.\n\nThe moment was fleeting but I was present.

This will be their one and only appearance in a Grand Prix this year. As a result, they won't qualify for the Final because of the required two Grand Prix events needed to qualify.\n\nNo matter. What will have me glued to the competition is the departure of sorts from their free dance program. It starts with the choice of contemporary American folk singer Rachel Yamagata's music. I am intrigued and looking forward to seeing a refreshed version of this wonderful team on its way to \u2013 presumably \u2013 the top step of the podium.\n\nFor Canadian ice dancers Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier, their coaches and fans, this event is a bit of a nail-biter. A disastrous sixth place skate in their rhythm dance at Skate Canada set the stage for a remarkable recovery but disappointing bronze medal at that event. Their Vincent program is one of the best free dances I have ever seen. Ever. That alone is worth seeing Gilles and Poirier in competition; whatever the result.\n\nGilles and Poirier remain Canada's strongest (and last remaining) hope to qualify an entry for the Final. In order to secure their spot, they need to finish no lower than second. A silver medal will trigger a tie-breaker with two other Russian dance teams and they will need a score of 177.47 or better to win the tie. In their sub-par Skate Canada outing, they finished with a score of 187, so if they get to second (and that is the key), clinching their spot shouldn't be a problem.\n\nChen in good shape\n\nFor American Nathan Chen, the road to Vancouver is a little less strenuous. If Chen finishes in fourth or better, he is on his way to the Final. His programs this year speak to his maturity and ongoing evolution as a skater. His full complement of amazing jumps is another reason I am confident he will take gold in France.\n\nI am also really looking forward to seeing French pair champions Vanessa James and Morgan Cipres. Over the last couple of years, James and Cipres have gone from being able to be competitive on the world stage to becoming the ones to beat. I fully expect them to take gold in France.\n\nFor the rest of the field and the Russian pair team in particular, who else fills out the podium has enormous significance. The results of the first five Grand Prix events mean that the 2017 world junior silver medallists Aleksandra Boikova and Dmitrii Kozlovksii have a chance to make the Final with a silver medal in Grenoble.\n\nUnpredictable. That's the way I would describe the women's event with a mixed bag of results from the skaters to this point. The standout to me is Japan's Rika Kihira, fresh from a win at the NHK Trophy. Her poise and execution in a beautiful free program earned her enough points to be able to climb out of a fifth-place finish in the short program to claim the title in Hiroshima.\n\nA similar thing happened to Olympic silver medallist Evgenia Medvedeva, who won the free program at Skate Canada. With a seventh-place finish in the short, it was remarkable that she got to within six points of gold and claimed a bronze medal.\n\nFor both women, the truth is that they need to improve on both segments of the competition regardless of result.

The latest projection is that ambulance crews will log a total of 16.5 million kilometres this year.\n\nJeff Fraser, director of provincial operations for EHS, is worried about the wear and tear on an increasingly fragile system and said he believes it's time for an overhaul.\n\n\"The safety net is getting thin,\" he said.\n\n\"Our EHS system model is really difficult to marry up with what's happening currently within our system and so in order to be sustainable, we really have to look at the way that we operate.\"\n\nJeff Fraser is the director of Emergency Health Services in Nova Scotia. (Jean Laroche/CBC)\n\nFraser points to the fact ambulance crews are sometimes spending entire shifts waiting with patients in hospital corridors, rather than on emergency calls, because emergency rooms are overcrowded.\n\nThis inability to hand over patients in a timely manner has been a benefit to Halifax-area taxi companies that are ferrying paramedics to and from hospitals at the beginning and end of their shifts.\n\nIn the past six months, EHS has spent $10,000 in cab fares to do just that.\n\nFraser is hoping a review commissioned by the province will lay out the need for major changes.\n\n\"Certainly status quo is not an option for us,\" he said. \"We're going to need to begin to change the way we deliver service over the next few years.\"\n\nFirm hired to review system\n\nA month ago, the province hired Fitch and Associates, a U.S.-based consulting firm to review the current EHS model and provide recommendations \"for the most efficient, effective and sustainable EMS system in Nova Scotia for the next 10 to 15 years.\"\n\nThe $145,000 contract calls for a final report by Dec. 28, 2018.\n\nThe time frame has been designed to give provincial authorities plenty of time to act on the recommendations before the ambulance service contract runs out with EHS in 2020.\n\nFraser is convinced the slow transfer times at hospitals will figure prominently in that final report.\n\n\"There's no way that the offload issue won't be apparent in the report,\" he said. \"It impedes our ability to operate our system each and every day.\"\n\nThe union representing paramedics says morale is at an all-time low. (Robert Short/CBC)\n\nIt's a problem that dates back more than a decade. In fact, a June 2007 auditor general's report noted \"that ambulance redeployment due to delays in Halifax emergency departments affected communities as far as Bridgewater, Oxford, and Yarmouth.\"\n\n\"We concluded that [the ambulance service] is subject to an increased risk of not being able to respond effectively to emergency situations due to unavailability of ambulances during these time periods,\" the report said.\n\nThat's when the service was responding to about 90,000 calls. It is now dealing with 170,000.\n\nAdd to that ER closures, service disruptions and an increase in the number of non-emergency transfers, and you have a system stretched to capacity, said Fraser.\n\n\"We've had a demand increase of about four per cent over the last number of years and some of these other operational impedance like the inability to offload patients at the hospital and the longer time on task, if that was to continue the EHS system would be stretched beyond what would be reasonable.\"\n\nA newly expanded and renovated EHS dispatch centre opened Wednesday in Halifax.

(Gerald Herbert/Associated Press)\n\nWhile the personnel size of any standalone Space Force would be comparable to the Coast Guard, its budget would double the maritime service's, according to the CSIS paper. A Space Corps department \u2014 kept within the Air Force in much the way the Marine Corps currently exists within the Navy \u2014 would require about 1,700 new staff for a total workforce of 27,300. This additional department would cost $11.3 billion a year in fiscal year 2019.\n\n\"If you're comparing the different Space Corps or Space Force options, the closest military service we have just in terms of size budget is going to be the Coast Guard,\" Harrison said during a phone briefing.\n\nEven so, a space combat unit within the Air Force likely won't cut it for this president. Trump wants an entirely new branch of the Armed Services that Harrison says would have an annual budget of up to $21.5 billion. Of that amount, only an estimated $550 million a year would be new funding, all of which still sounds manageable to Harrison, who publicly backs the Space Force idea.\n\nThe additional funding would be as much as \"a handful of F-35\" fighter jets, Harrison said. (The unit price of an F-35 in fiscal 2020 is about $80 million.) Extra costs involve line items like changing emblems, creating a new flag for the service, designing uniforms and administrative tasks including updating regulations.\n\nA dedicated Space Force building wouldn't necessarily need to be constructed either, if existing facilities are used instead.\n\n(CBC)\n\nU.S. Vice-President Mike Pence said in August that Trump will call on Congress to allocate $8 billion over five years to create a Space Force.\n\nHarrison doesn't think cost \"should be that big of a factor\" in decisions to create the service. \"I think a bigger factor is whether or not people think it's needed, quite frankly.\"\n\nNational security consultant Dan Hill agrees that getting public buy-in is more important than wrangling over budgets.\n\n\"When you start talking about a few billion versus $8 billion, the public doesn't distinguish between those that much,\" said Hill, who runs the D.C. branding firm Hill Impact. \"In Washington parlance, a billion is a rounding error. But to most people, a billion is a lot.\"\n\n(CBC)\n\nHill doubts the Trump administration has effectively sold the idea.\n\n\"We've had a lot of broad statements about the importance of having a consolidated effort, as it pertains to space. But what is NASA's role? What is the Department of Defense doing today, and not doing today that a Space Force would address?\" he asked.\n\n\"Is it simply just giving it equal footing to the other services? Is it really just a symbolic gesture to say, 'This is important, we'll put it under one umbrella?'\"\n\nHill expects a major challenge will be convincing Americans a Space Force is necessary right now, while reassuring them the government hasn't neglected to protect them thus far.\n\n\"You want to be able to say, 'We've got this, we're already doing this. But this will make it even better or address a future issue,'\" Hill said.\n\nHill isn't convinced those questions have been answered. The Trump administration's rationale is that a Space Force will defend the nation's satellite systems from foreign adversaries. Skeptics point out that the U.S already has an Air Force Space Command, based in Colorado.\n\n'Not a crazy idea'\n\nSenior Pentagon officials have bristled at the Space Force idea, too. Former Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James told CNBC in July that in her conversations with Pentagon brass, \"none of them are in favour of a Space Force.\"\n\nBillionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk endorsed the concept, noting that the formation of the Air Force was once \"wildly panned as a ridiculous thing\" because the Army managed aircraft during the Second World War. Renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson also remarked that a Space Force is \"not a crazy idea.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s Space Force would cost billions of taxpayer dollars in redundant spending to satisfy an ego. My take on why it\u2019s a dumb idea. <a href=\"https://t.co/vIdNMvGMbb\">pic.twitter.com/vIdNMvGMbb</a> \u2014@ShuttleCDRKelly\n\nBut how much a Space Force might cost to launch, what its full scope might be and who might staff its headquarters has yet to have been decided. The Trump administration is expected to put forward a budget request in February.\n\nBy Harrison's accounting, an expansive \"heavy\" option for an independent Space Force would cost taxpayers about $21.5 billion a year, and include the transfer of about 18,300 active duty, 2,800 guard and reserve and 24,300 civilian personnel from other military services such as the Air Force, Army and Navy.\n\nMore than 96 per cent of that funding would come from existing Department of Defense budgets, he noted.\n\n\"We already have space forces. This would just be a reorganization of them,\" Harrison said. \"It's much less cool than it sounds at first.\"\n\nCSIS's budget analysis aligns with Deputy Secretary of Defence Patrick Shanahan's estimate that the costs would be in the \"single digit\" billions. It also looks like a bargain compared to numbers leaked in September for the Air Force's $13-billion estimate for the first five years to run a standalone Space Force.\n\nA Trump campaign email from Aug. 9, 2018, from which this screen grab is taken, asked subscribers to vote for their favourite logo for Space Force.

There, the government has built up culinary tourism partly by mandating a high national minimum wage, along with standard service charges on restaurant bills.

(Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nCanada is exploring a potential trade agreement with the ASEAN bloc, consisting of ten countries in Southeast Asia with a combined GDP of $3 trillion US, about double that of Canada. This dynamic region has a young and rapidly growing population, with an ever-expanding consumer base. It is also home to the world's fourth most populous country, Indonesia.\n\nThe snag is that Canada is late to the game. Very late, some would say.\n\nASEAN is the part of the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), led by China and includes countries such as Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India. The member countries are close to sealing a deal, which aims to cut tariff and non-tariff barriers among them. RCEP notably excludes the U.S., as part of China's strategy of keeping its strategic competitor out of Asia.\n\nWith the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) now defunct after the U.S. withdrawal from it last year, RCEP is now the only game in town. With a combined GDP of nearly $50 trillion US, the member countries account for 40 per cent of the world's economic output.\n\nCanada is not in RCEP. Demand for Canada's exports that will do well in Southeast Asia, such as agricultural products, foodstuff and transport equipment, have been met to a large extent by countries with similar comparative advantage, such as Australia and New Zealand. Those countries will not want to see Canada having closer relationship with the region. Hence, Canada needs to double, or even triple, its efforts in courting the Southeast Asian nations.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau tells students at the National University of Singapore about his nineteenth century family connection to the city. 1:21\n\nThe other no-less-important objective of Trudeau's trip to Asia was to assure China that Canada is still very keen on deepening their economic ties, though their relationship is now complicated by the new free trade agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nChina was the elephant in the room during the final phase of the USMCA negotiations. The addition of Article 32.10 , which allows a member to terminate the agreement if a party enters into a free trade agreement with a \"non-market country\" (meaning China), is a shrewd U.S. strategy to keep its trading partners away from China. With the full throttle U.S.-China trade war in the backdrop, Article 32.10 is another weapon in the arsenal that the U.S. can deploy against its competitor.\n\nAll of this means that Canada needs to diversify its trading partners desperately. About three-quarters of our exports are destined to one single country: the U.S. Another 10 per cent goes to Europe and other developed economies. However, advanced nations are mature economies with slow and steady growth rates. They are not as dynamic as the developing countries with rapid growth rates and increasing purchasing power.\n\nYet, only one-tenth of our trade is with emerging economies such as China, Mexico, India and Brazil. This put us significantly behind our peers in this respect. About 40 per cent of Australia's trade is with the emerging economies; about 30 per cent for the U.S. and Japan; and 20 per cent for Germany.\n\nWhy does Canada like doing business with the advanced nations? The reason is simple. They have the democratic institutions, rule of law and secure property rights that are akin to ours here in Canada. It is much easier to do negotiate a contract, set up a factory and hire workers in the U.S. than it is in China, India or Indonesia. We don't need to hire an interpreter, learn a new language, culture or social norms. We can expect business partners to live up to their end of deals, and the public institutions in host countries to step in when things go wrong.\n\nWe also live next to the largest developed economy in the world. It has been simply easy, perhaps too easy, for Canadian businesses. So much so that we have become complacent and oblivious of the fact that the world's economic centre has now shifted to the developing economies of Asia, which many Canadian businesses continue to ignore at our own peril. With the U.S. getting more insular and pandering to populist demands, the need for Canada to play catch-up and diversify has never been as pressing as it is now.\n\nCanadian businesses will need to venture out of their comfort zone. To learn about economic and political risks of operating in those unstable business environments, and how best to cope with them. It will not be easy; our learning curve is steep, and our government has come to it late. But in today's competitive globalized world, no pain no gain.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

(Tijana Martin/Canadian Press)\n\nIn Ontario, the Ministry of Eduction requires public school boards to develop protocols with the police, that include incidents in which school principals have a mandatory obligation to contact police. Suspected sexual assault is among those incidents.\n\nHowever, many of the standards that govern public schools do not apply to private schools, including the duty to report suspected sexual assault to police, said Schuman. This means, in the case at St. Michael's, Reeves would not have been obligated to report the alleged abuse to the police, he said.\n\n\"Private schools were exempted from almost everything under the Education Act,\" Schuman said.\n\nYet it's a little less clear what responsibilities Reeves may have had under the province's Child, Youth and Family Services Act (CYFSA). Section 125 of that act states that a person who performs professional or official duties with respect to children, and has reasonable grounds to suspect abuse must immediately report that abuse to a Children's Aid Society.\n\nReeves has acknowledged the legal obligations the school abides by in reporting such incidents fall under that act. He has also said he is not aware of Children's Aid Services being notified about any incident.\n\nBut Schuman said private schools have interpreted Section 125 of CYFSA to mean that principals are only required to immediately contact Children's Aid Societies in cases of suspected abuse at the hands of a parent or guardian.\n\nAnd because the video does not show a parent or guardian abusing a child, private schools might conclude they don't have to report it to Children's Aid.\n\n\"I think that there are arguments to be made on both sides of how that section is worded,\" said Erin Ellis, a Toronto-based lawyer who specializes in civil cases involving sexual abuse. \"It is a grey area there because the abuse was student-on-student versus a teacher on student or somebody else who had charge of the child.\"\n\nSchuman said Reeves could also argue that that he didn't have a duty to report immediately because there was no time necessity, as the child was out of immediate danger.\n\nHowever, Schuman believes that Reeves and private schools legally and ethically do have an obligation to report immediately to Children's Aid.\n\nSt. Michael's alumni held an emergency meeting about the issue Tuesday night. Annual mandatory education about bullying and hazing was suggested.

They drafted that for a reason and they drafted that even though \u2026 the victim may not want it reported to the Children's Aid or to the police.\"\n\nAs for legal ramifications for not reporting such abuse, a person convicted under Section 125 of the CYFSA faces fines of up to $5,000.\n\nSchuman said a Crown counsel could try to prosecute Reeves, but it's rare that people are charged with this offence\n\n\"There hasn't been a lot of interest in prosecuting these things. But if you got a Crown who was thinking, 'Yeah, this needs to be sorted out' or 'I'm really angry that he didn't [report] in this circumstances,' than absolutely a Crown could try to prosecute him.\"\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Darren Haynes", "title": "Flames use 5-goal 1st period to fly past Jets", "description": "Sam Bennett scored the go-ahead goal and added an assist as the Calgary Flames erupted for five first-period goals, then hung on for a 6-3 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday night.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/winnipeg-jets-calgary-flames-recap-1.4915475", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915862.1542865202!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bennett-sam-112118.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T06:00:11Z", "content": "Sam Bennett scored the go-ahead goal and added an assist as the Calgary Flames erupted for five first-period goals, then hung on for a 6-3 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday night.

But something unusual turned up on their motion-activated cameras.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2017, the team documented 401 visits from all three of Canada's bear species.\n\nMost of those visits \u2014 366 \u2014 were from polar bears. But 25 were from black bears and 10 were from grizzlies.\n\nThis isn't just science catching up to what's been going on forever, Clark said. Researchers have been busy on that particular piece of ground since the 1960s without ever observing the three species mingling regularly, although Clark recalls spotting a grizzly in the area in the late '90s.\n\n\"Back then it was unheard of,\" he said. \"But something has definitely changed in that part of the world and they are regulars now.\n\n\"We have been picking them up every year in our cameras. There's some pretty strong indications that at least one [grizzly] bear is denning not too far away.\"\n\nScientists have guessed the three species may have used the same habitat in Beaufort Delta in the top corner of the Northwest Territories. But it's never been confirmed, despite the presence of polar-grizzly hybrids.\n\nNew bear on the block\n\nIn Wapusk, it seems grizzlies are the new bear on the block.\n\nBlack bears and polar bears have long used the area. The boreal forest \u2014 good black bear habitat \u2014 goes almost to the shore in many places and the coastline gives polar bears access to sea ice where they can hunt seals.\n\nBut grizzlies are currently spreading out, probably from the Thelon Game Sanctuary northeast of Great Slave Lake, local elders say. Clark said that's likely to be what is happening in the park.\n\n\"[Grizzlies] have undergone a very significant range expansion in the past couple decades. They have expanded their range out to the Hudson Bay coast and down into Manitoba and possibly even into Ontario.\"\n\nBerry abundance has increased over the last decades and Clark suggests that's encouraging young grizzlies looking for their own turf to settle down.\n\nA black bear is seen in Wapusk National Park in a May 16, 2016, handout photo taken by a camera trap.

Clark said climate change, which is both affecting sea ice and changing the plants that grow locally, is likely a factor.\n\n\"The place is warming like crazy.\"\n\nThere's no evidence yet of the three bear species coming in contact with each other. But the cameras did record a black bear and a polar bear crossing paths within three hours of each other.\n\n\"No question, they knew each other were in the area and they likely had an idea what each other was,\" Clark said.\n\n\"How they interact is a really big question. There's all kinds of things that could go on.\"\n\nA polar bear is seen in Wapusk National Park in an Oct. 6, 2014, handout photo taken by a camera trap.

So what are you seeing your schools?\n\nA. We have 60 per cent [English Language Learners] students in Brooks. In High River, we have 40 per cent, in Canmore we have 25 per cent, and in Okotoks we have seven to 10 per cent depending on the schools.\n\nQ. How many English Language Learners are we talking about in total?\n\nA. In the province about 10 years ago there were 60,000. As of late 2017, there were 110,000 in the province. So it doubled in less than a decade. This represents about 15 to 16 per cent of the total number of students.\n\nQ. What kind of teaching or support does a child learning English receive in your schools?\n\nA. Currently there's a couple of ways that they receive the support. One is when they're within the classroom in the inclusive environment, the teachers are trained in a methodology that is designed to provide the greatest potential for learning for the student.\n\nThe one we use is called the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol. The teachers in these very high-needs areas are all trained in this and as well there is the existence of aides.\n\nAlso there are standalone courses that are made up of only the ELL students and often they're grouped with the same proficiency levels so that they can be taught grammar and the language itself apart from all the rest of the curriculum that they need to know just so they can actually gain a mastery of the English language.\n\nQ. Just how well-prepared are these teachers to teach English as a second language?\n\nA. Not all divisions do it the identical way. Some divisions may not use the same methods that we use, but we do try our best to prepare the Professional Development (PD) for our teachers. We also share this PD with other divisions as well.\n\nQ. Do you feel like your teachers are well-prepared to teach these students?\n\nA. Ideally every teacher everywhere should be trained in English Language Learning protocol, and in our case the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol. The reason being that in the high-needs areas where they are trained very well, they are very capable and they're dealing with it within a very difficult situation, but very very successfully.\n\nIf you look at our results for our students there, they are very good. My concern, I guess, is where there's only one or two ELL students in a class and perhaps if the teacher isn't trained there, then these children could slip through the cracks.\n\nIt's very important that everybody every school division, rural and urban alike, get the support that they need. And through the Alberta School Boards Association general meeting a motion was passed to urge Alberta Education to take on this task in a better, more efficient fashion.\n\nQ. What does that translate to in terms of dollars?\n\nA. Now as far as our motion that we put forward, we were asking for Albert Education to dedicate more attention and personnel to the areas as the English Language Learning curriculum development, and implementation instruction, and assessment as requested by boards.\n\nSo this could potentially be a rededication of existing dollars or it could be new dollars coming in.\n\nSo I really don't know a dollar cost because we thought this could be realized in a couple of different ways, so there is no hard dollar value assigned to it at this time.\n\nQ. What are you hearing from the province in terms of response?\n\nA. This is a lobby point that the Alberta School Boards Association will take forward. Now Alberta Education has always been very cooperative with the boards where the boards are expressing need, they respond.\n\nSo we're expecting a positive response for certain, we really are.\n\nWith files from The Homestretch\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Emily Chung", "title": "Want it tomorrow?

Or returned an item of clothing using the free return shipping label because you weren't sure which size to buy, so you bought more than one?\n\nWhat you may not have realized is those convenient perks can drastically expand the carbon footprint of an online sale. And think of that multiplied by millions of shoppers across Canada and billions around the world.\n\n\"I think everyone should care about it,\" said Sharon Cullinane, a researcher at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who has been studying the environmental impact of online shopping for nearly a decade.\n\nBlack Friday, Cyber Monday and the weeks leading to and following them mark a pre-Christmas online shopping frenzy across North America, culminating in a parcel baby boom a week or so later.\n\nOn Dec. 4, 2017, Canada Post broke a record for most parcels delivered in a day \u2014 1.83 million. Despite the current rotating strikes, the Crown corporation's parcel delivery revenue has been growing more than 20 per cent a year with the exploding popularity of online shopping.\n\nA comparison of greenhouse gas emissions from in-store and online shopping, with and without rush delivery, of a toy in an urban area. This doesn't include the research step. Emissions are in kilograms of CO2 equivalents.\n\nIn theory, buying online could be greener than going to a store.\n\nA 2013 study from MIT's Center for Transportation and Logistics calculated that the carbon footprint of a traditional shopper purchasing a toy in a store is higher that that of someone who buys the same thing online with regular shipping (more about that later).\n\nThat's because parcel carriers use a more efficient delivery system than you driving to the mall, and the carbon footprint of a website is smaller than that of a brick-and-mortar store.\n\nA 2013 study calculated that the carbon footprint of a traditional shopper is double that of someone who buys the same thing online. But fast shipping and no-charge returns are among the many factors that can change that. (Andrew Kelly/Reuters)\n\nBut Cullinane has found it isn't clear whether online or traditional shopping is greener because so many factors come into play. Here's a look at some, many of which shoppers have some control over.\n\n'Colossal' stress on the logistics system\n\n\"Want it today?\" Online retail giant Amazon routinely tempts customers with that question. And it offers free two-day shipping to customers who subscribe to its Amazon Prime service.\n\nThat's set up some high expectations. A recent UPS study found 63 per cent of Canadians expect orders placed by noon to qualify for same-day delivery and 61 per cent expect orders placed by 5 p.m. to arrive the next day.\n\n\"The stress that puts on the logistics system and therefore the impacts on the environment \u2026 is quite colossal,\" said Cullinane.\n\nFaster shipping completely changes what's needed to get your order to you, and that drastically increases the carbon emissions generated in the process \u2014 the MIT study found online shopping with rush delivery was less environmentally friendly than going to the store.\n\nA UPS survey found 40 per cent of Canadian consumers shop online and and at a brick-and-mortar store for the same purchase. 'Either do one or the other,' advises Miguel Jaller, a researcher at the University of California Davis. (Kite_rin/Shutterstock)\n\nWith normal shipping, retailers consolidate orders into as few boxes as possible, pack trucks as full as possible and choose the most efficient routes to make as many deliveries as possible over the shortest distance.\n\nWith faster shipping, all that becomes difficult or impossible, said Miguel Jaller, a researcher at the University of California Davis who studies sustainable transportation and logistics.\n\nEmptier trucks have to deliver to fewer customers who are farther apart in order to meet deadlines. That means more trucks driving longer distances per delivery, and often multiple deliveries for the same order, generating a lot more emissions and traffic. In some cases, retailers may even have to use planes to move products from one warehouse to another to speed things up.\n\nJaller recommends not choosing faster shipping unless you need it, even if it's free or you've already paid for the option.\n\nBuy 3 sizes, return 2\n\nMaybe you bought three sizes of the same shoes because you weren't sure which would fit. Or added an item you didn't really want to meet the free-shipping threshold. Or just impulse-bought something that was on sale and then thought better of it.\n\nChances are, you've taken advantage of free online returns.\n\nThey make people more willing to buy items they've never seen. But they come at a high environmental cost, says Cullinane, who's been studying returns in detail.\n\nHer recent study found people tend to over-order online and have a return rate of about 25 to 30 per cent, compared to six to 10 per cent when they deal with physical shops.\n\nAnd it's worst at this time of year. Canada Post said return volumes increased 17 per cent during Cyber Week last year compared to a week prior.\n\nReturned items don't just go back to the local store \u2014 they often feed into a global logistics system that may take them to be processed in a country where wages are lower.\n\n\"The returned goods make journeys of thousands of miles,\" Cullinane said, adding that to make matters worse, retailers often expedite shipping to make an item available to another customer as quickly as possible.\n\nDiscouraging unnecessary returns and the carbon emissions that go with them is one reason Toronto sustainable clothing retailer Miik doesn't offer free return shipping, says company president Susan Cadman. (Emily Chung/CBC)\n\nDiscouraging unnecessary returns and the carbon emissions that go with them is one reason Toronto sustainable clothing retailer Miik doesn't offer free return shipping, says company president Susan Cadman.\n\nMiik is also trying other methods to discourage returns, like putting better sizing information online and getting customer service to help customers find the right size.\n\nBut customers can also make a difference by choosing to order less and minimize returns, or returning items to a store if they were making that trip anyway, instead of shipping them.\n\nCullinane suggests, \"If you send something back, think about what happens to it.\"\n\nWe're No. 1 in cross-border online shopping\n\nAccording to the recent UPS survey, Canadians are the biggest international online shoppers in the world. Among Canadian respondents, 83 per cent had bought from an international retailer, most commonly in the U.S. or China. Most said it was because the brands or products they like were not available in Canada or were cheaper elsewhere.\n\nAmazon offers free two-day shipping to subscribers of its Amazon Prime service. Researchers say customers should only use it when they need it, as shorter delivery times reduce efficiency and increase greenhouse gas emissions. (Mark Lennihan/Associated Press)\n\nOf course, buying from far away generates more emissions.\n\nWhen you buy an international product from a local store, it probably came by boat and truck in a very full, efficient load. If you purchase something similar online, it makes a faster, sometimes complicated journey that generally involves air travel.\n\nCullinane recommends thinking about that before you buy something from overseas because it's a little cheaper.\n\n\"If one has come from Asia, and one has come from a more local place, think about what that actually means in terms of [the] environment,\" she said.\n\nAnd what if you have to return it? Her recent study notes that returns from Asia often go by air, \"thus magnifying the adverse environmental impacts.\"\n\nNobody's home\n\nSometimes when a delivery truck takes an online order to a customer's home, no one is there to accept it.\n\nThat means the truck needs to go back, perhaps multiple times, generating extra emissions, before dropping off the order or taking it to a post office or courier outlet where the customer has to retrieve it.\n\nCullinane has experienced 11 delivery attempts on an online order, even though she texted the delivery company every day to tell them she wouldn't be there.\n\nCanada Post said return volumes increased 17 per cent during Cyber Week last year compared to a week prior. (Carlos Osorio/Reuters)\n\nOne way to prevent this is for orders to be delivered to a nearby pickup point such as a store or post office. That can also allow delivery companies to consolidate many orders more efficiently, making that greener, provided it doesn't result in an extra long car trip for the customer.\n\nSuch delivery locations are common in Sweden, Cullinane said.\n\nBut in Canada, UPS found survey respondents had orders shipped somewhere other than their home only 38 per cent of the time. Only U.S. customers did that less often.\n\nCullinane suggests alternate delivery points might work better if governments got involved in making them public infrastructure like bus stops.\n\nHow about just buying less?\n\nIt goes without saying that the most effective way to reduce your online shopping carbon footprint is by buying less.\n\nUnfortunately, Jaller's research shows that in fact, people are buying more, both online and offline.\n\nThis is an online shopping pickup point in Hong Kong. In some countries, they're popular, but in Canada, online shoppers get items shipped to a point other than their home only 38 per cent of the time. (Bobby Yip/Reuters)\n\nIn fact, the recent UPS survey found 40 per cent of Canadian might make part of the same purchase both online and offline, generating carbon emissions from both. They might visit a store to look at something, then order it online, or order most of their groceries for delivery, but pick up a few fruits and veggies in-store.\n\nJaller advises shoppers: \"Either do one or the other.\"\n\nHe and Cullinane urge shoppers to be more mindful of what they buy, and plan ahead when they can.\n\nJaller suggests that if you need something regularly, it's better to get a subscription so retailers and logistics and delivery companies can plan for a more efficient delivery.\n\n\"We are not paying for fast shipping, we are not paying for returns, but there's a cost to society,\" says Jaller. \"It is our duty to have sustainable choices in our shopping behaviour.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Bethany Lindsay", "title": "Manufacturer says no B.C. customers received mislabelled cannabis spray", "description": "The manufacturer of a cannabis spray suspected of being sold with incorrect labels says no B.C. customers actually received the mislabelled product.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/manufacturer-says-no-b-c-customers-received-mislabelled-cannabis-spray-1.4915596", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4902189.1542052384!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/aphria-cannabis-greehouse-leamington-on.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T01:19:34Z", "content": "The manufacturer of a cannabis spray suspected of being sold with incorrect labels says no B.C. customers actually received the mislabelled product.

That stressed the need to get Alberta crude to markets besides the U.S., he said.\n\n\"Ottawa is living on a different economic planet. We must get our product to tidewater and nothing today moves us closer to doing that. This update does not address one of the biggest concerns Albertans have: getting fair value for our non-renewable resource,\" Ceci told media Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe provincial finance minister said he was disappointed that, despite a strong focus on exports in the federal government's fall fiscal update, there was no line item for oil-by-rail \u2014 or any other specific action to address the impact the oil price differential has had on Canada's economy.\n\nPremier Rachel Notley's government has been pushing Ottawa for increased rail capacity in the absence of new pipelines.\n\nThe fiscal update outlines $17.6 billion in new spending over six years, $16.5 billion of which is measures aimed at boosting business productivity.\n\nThat includes an allocation of $1.1 billion toward infrastructure and resources for exports, with the goal of boosting the country's overseas exports to focus on markets beyond the U.S.\n\nThe update points out that 99 per cent of Canada's oil is exported to its southern neighbours, creating a \"near-total reliance\" on the U.S. market.\n\nOver the next three years, the federal government is allocating $13.6 million to improve rail passenger and freight data to help supply chains operate more efficiently.\n\nBut Ceci said while he's happy with other items in the fiscal update, specific action needs to be taken to address the impact the oil price differential has had on Canada's economy.\n\n\"The crisis in this province affects the whole country \u2026 we have, this week in Parliament Hill a ticker that's showing the amount of revenue that's not coming into this country as a result of oil glut,\" said Ceci.\n\n\u200bNot a 'realistic expectation'\n\nHowever Bev Dahlby, research director at the University of Calgary's school of public policy, said while the update didn't specifically take Alberta into account, perhaps that shouldn't be a surprise, given Ottawa's $4.5-billion purchase of the stalled Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.\n\n\"I don't think there was any more that they could do,\" Dahlby said. \"In this fiscal update I don't think that was a realistic expectation.\"\n\nBen Brunnen of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said he'd like to see more done to help the oil industry's competitiveness. (Anis Heydari/CBC)\n\nIn an interview on CBC's Power & Politics, Canada's Finance Minister Bill Morneau was asked if there was anything in his plan to immediately address the effects of the differential.\n\n\"First of all, let me just say, this is a really big challenge. This has been a challenge that's been coming for a while; it's the reason that we stepped forward with the Trans Mountain pipeline purchase,\" Morneau said. \"It's one that we're committed to working through in the right way. So I really understand how people are feeling.\"\n\nAs for what he meant by the \"right way,\" he said the federal government's goal was to respond to the Federal Court, which levied criticism over how the approval of the pipeline expansion was handled.\n\nSpecifically, Morneau said the focus will be on considering issues on the West Coast and holding meaningful consultations with Indigenous peoples, in order to move forward to have the oil and gas sector and the economy be successful.\n\nListen to Finance Minister Bill Morneau's full interview on Power & Politics:\n\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau joined Power & Politics Wednesday to explain the government's fall economic update and why there's no plan to return to a balanced budget. 8:22\n\nThe finance minister also said he believed items in the plan would have \"an immediate impact\" on the oil and gas sector, along with the rest of Canadian industry, despite not being specifically geared to address the differential.\n\n\"I don't want to suggest that we've found a solution for that problem. That is a really difficult, long-term problem, and I think it's something that clearly the sector's working together with the Alberta government on,\" Morneau told host Vassy Kapelos.\n\n\"We're going to continue to be resolute in our goal of assuring that we can get the cleanest resources in the world to international markets. We think that's important so we're on it.\"\n\nCAPP VP says more help needed\n\nBen Brunnen \u2014 vice-president of fiscal and oilsands at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers \u2014 said the fiscal update included one boon for oil companies: allowing them the ability to write off capital expenditures more quickly.\n\nBusinesses will be able to write off the full cost of machinery and equipment used for the manufacturing or processing of goods, as well as the cost of some clean energy equipment.\n\n\"These changes actually help Canada's oil and gas industry in that they can recover their costs faster which is helpful for competitiveness,\" Brunnen said.\n\nCosting $80M each day\n\nBut, he said, it won't be enough to solve the problems the industry is facing.\n\n\"Overall I would say this is a positive first step but more work needs to be done to improve the competitiveness of the oil and gas sector.\"\n\nThat message was echoed by the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, which gave the federal government credit for its business-friendly initiatives but said without addressing market access, its measures fall short.\n\n\"We continue to urge the federal government to take actions to remove regulatory barriers,\" said chamber president Sandip Lalli in an emailed statement.\n\n\"We are disillusioned the economic update did not meaningfully address the issues that are costing the Canadian economy as much as $80 million a day.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Bryan Eneas", "title": "Agribition panelists encourage Sask.

The province said at the time that the wage gap between women and men ranged between 12 per cent to 29 per cent depending on the workplace.\n\nThe legislation requires all publicly advertised job postings to include a salary rate or range, bars employers from asking about past compensation and prohibits reprisal against employees who do discuss or disclose compensation.\n\nIt also creates a system that requires large employers to track and report compensation gaps based on gender and other diversity characteristics, and share the information with the province.
