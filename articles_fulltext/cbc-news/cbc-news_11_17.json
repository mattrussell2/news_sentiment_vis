Michael Turner, the committee's acting chairman, asked whether Canada intends to table a plan for meeting the two per cent of GDP standard for defence spending that was agreed to by alliance members at a summit in Wales in 2014.\n\n\"Many of the nations that are here are either meeting their two per cent or have in place a plan to reach the two per cent,\" said Turner. \"Canada is one of those countries who has not yet put forward a commitment to reach the two per cent although that is a commitment that Canada joined in making at Wales.\"\n\nThomas stuck to the Liberal government's line, saying Canada intends to increase its defence budget by 1.46 per cent by the end of 2024.\n\n\"Canada's defence budget is growing by 70 per cent as a result of Strong, Secure, Engaged (Canada's defence policy),\" said Thomas. \"We also on the ground are leading a significant number of operations, and we have never not participated in a NATO commitment or operation.\"\n\nShe also reiterated that Canada believes it contributes to the alliance in a \"qualitative\" way through an active participation in the alliance.\n\n\"The defence budget is a significant increase in funding for national defence and our prime minister is very satisfied with that contribution,\" Thomas said.\n\n'It's not enough'\n\nBut Bob Stewart, a member of the United Kingdom delegation, reminded Thomas that Canada agreed to the commitment, adding that it's \"crucial\" it be honoured.\n\nStewart, a Conservative MP, then questioned Canada's current defence spending commitment.\n\nDelegates and reporters attend the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday.

We're desperate for answers,\" said sister Brittany Boucher.\n\nMountain had just moved to the home in Lac La Biche with his wife and three children just a few weeks before the shooting.

We can respond in the event deterrence fails,\" Dunford says.\n\nThe threat vectors facing Canada\n\nCanada is facing similar challenges in responding to the ever-changing nature of security threats.\n\nGen. Jonathan Vance, chief of the defence staff, told CBC's The House this weekend that the Trudeau government's defence policy requires armed forces to take a more holistic approach to security issues. That includes working with the Americans to modernize NORAD to deter incursions by Russian submarines in Canada's Arctic, and to address the continued nuclear posturing of North Korea.\n\n\"We have to think about new ways to deal with these threats. Not everything is a shoot-down type of scenario,\" he said. \"We have to watch technology and those things that, at a strategic level, could cause potential harm to our countries.\"\n\nVital trade routes in South China Sea\n\nThe policy also led Canada to contribute a warship to U.S. naval exercises in the South China Sea, to deter China from unilaterally laying claim to international waters.\n\n\"Exercising freedom of navigation through the vital trade routes in the South China Sea is simply a continuation of the international norms that the world needs to be prosperous and safe,\" Vance said.\n\nPublic Policy Forum's Edward Greenspon and former Clerk of the Privy Council Kevin Lynch, discuss the Public Policy Forum's new report which calls for increased trade with China. 9:31\n\nBoth military leaders also spoke in Halifax about the military's role in dealing with potential threats posed by mass human migration around the world, as people seek safer havens to escape poverty and violence.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered more than 5,000 U.S. troops to the border with Mexico to stop the so-called caravan of migrants heading north from Central America.\n\nThe military and Central American migrants\n\nDunford told the forum that the role of soldiers is to support the work of police and border patrol officers with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"Nothing we are doing is illegal. I can tell you we looked at that very carefully,\" he said. \"We are not coming in contact with the migrants. Our job is not to deny access to migrants to the United States. I think it's important people understand that.\"\n\nVance told The House that mass migration is a problem, but the answer is not to thwart migrants, but to address the reasons they are on the move.\n\n\"And these things tend to be tied together. We must understand that problems are not in and of themselves for the military to solve or to define. More and more the security threats we face, the defence threats that we face, can be seen through so many lenses that we have to tie it all together.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the Trudeau government unveiled a campaign to inform Canadians of the benefits of immigration. The campaign followed weeks of pressure from the opposition Conservatives who've called the influx of asylum-seekers from the U.S. a crisis.\n\nAt the same time, Canada Border Services Agency is stepping up efforts to deport failed refugee complainants.

(Mindy Johnson)\n\nThe other side of the story\n\nJohnson first became inspired by the women of Disney while working behind the scenes at the Walt Disney company.\n\nYears later, she realized that very little had been told about about the contributions of Disney's female animators.\n\n\"I thought it was going to be a charming little book, but then I realized, this was the other half of the animation process that we've been looking past...for almost a century,\" she said.\n\nWhen she thinks back to classic films like Alice in Wonderland and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, she can't help but see women's contributions.\n\n\"It's their artistry that we are seeing on screen through colour and brushwork and ink pen lines. It's masterful artistry,\" said Johnson.\n\nThrough her research, she found that women's roles in the industry gradually began to grow. They moved beyond inking and painting \u2014 where they would take an artist's sketch and draw it in ink on a sheet of celluloid, then colour it in by hand \u2014 into careers in animating, editing, camera work and writing.\n\nMindy Johnson says women have always been involved in animation, but were often overlooked. (Mindy Johnson)\n\nThe mother of animation\n\nWhile Walt Disney is often referred to as the grandfather of animation, Margaret Winkler is the mother, says Johnson.\n\nWinkler was one of the earliest female producers of animation, with international hits like the cartoon, Felix the Cat.\n\nIn 1922, Winkler's production company, Winkler Pictures, signed an unknown animator to produce the Alice comedies, an animated cartoon starring a live action girl based on the Lewis Carroll novel, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\n\nThat animator's name was Walt Disney and that contract marked the creation of the Disney Brothers Studio\u200d \u2014 later named the Walt Disney company.\n\nJohnson says Winkler worked with Disney to make his animation better and more relatable to audiences, but noted Winkler's contributions have been widely forgotten.\n\nJohnson hopes her work as an author and educator will inspire women to consider a career in animation.\n\n\"If we know this past, we can move forward with a whole new beginning in terms of trailblazing...where women have been and what their contributions have been and can be.\"\n\nYou can listen to the full interview below;"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Canadian Press", "title": "Blue Jays deal Aledmys Diaz to Astros for triple-A starter", "description": "The Toronto Blue Jays traded utility infielder Aledmys Diaz to the Houston Astros on Saturday for starting pitcher Trent Thornton.

It's an annual event \u2014 a mass extermination of broadleaf trees mandated by the province.\n\nThe eradication of trees like aspen and birch on regenerating forest stands is meant to make room for more commercially valuable conifer species like pine and Douglas fir.\n\nBut experts say it also removes one of the best natural defences we have against wildfire, at a time when our warming climate is helping make large, destructive fires more and more common.\n\n\"It blows my mind that nobody is talking about this,\" said James Steidle, a member of the anti-glyphosate group Stop the Spray B.C.\n\n\"The experts know this stuff. They've known about this stuff for decades, but it's just not being translated into reality.\"\n\nWhen aspen and other broadleaves are allowed to flourish, they form \"natural fuel breaks\" if their leaves are out, according to Lori Daniels, a professor of forest ecology at the University of B.C. That's why aspen stands are often referred to as \"asbestos forests\" in wildfire science circles.\n\nA forests ministry spokesperson said the government recognizes that aspen and other deciduous trees can help reduce the wildfire threat to communities, and that in the future, more thought will be put into planting broadleaf trees near homes and businesses.\n\nNonetheless, the rules about aspen in managed forest stands remain largely unchanged.\n\nThe province's Forest Planning and Practices Regulation states that when a block of forest is regrowing after a wildfire or logging, broadleaves can't make up more than five per cent of trees, or two hectares \u2014 whichever total is smaller. The concern is that trees like aspen will out-compete conifer species, which are the lifeblood of the timber industry.\n\nIf there's too much aspen, the block must be sprayed with glyphosate, a chemical known more familiarly as the active ingredient in Roundup. Over the last three years, 42,531 hectares of B.C. forest have been treated with the herbicide.\n\n'That's just nuts'\n\n\"At the end of the day, we have rules that make fire-resistant trees illegal in our forests. That's just nuts,\" Steidle said.\n\nAspen naturally thrives after a forest has been cleared by logging or wildfire. Their root systems can survive for thousands of years underground, and they're capable of sprouting new clone trees as soon as there's enough sunshine and moisture.\n\nGlyphosate doesn't just kill aspen trees \u2014 it can also destroy the root system.\n\n\"When you spray a forest, that's going to last for the lifetime of the forest,\" Steidle said.\n\nThe Shovel Lake wildfire burns through a coniferous forest in the summer of 2018. (B.C. Wildfire Service)\n\nAccording to Daniels, that's a major loss in a province that struggling with how to prepare for wildfires after two record-setting seasons in a row.\n\n\"When fire is burning through needle leaf forest, it tends to be very vigorous and very fast-moving,\" Daniels said. \"When fire comes into a forest that has broadleaf trees in it, the conditions change so the fire behaviour is less vigorous and the rate of spread slows down.\"\n\nTrees like aspen naturally have a higher water content and don't usually contain the volatile chemical compounds that can make trees like pine so flammable. They also provide more shade, which creates a cooler, more humid environment in the understory, Daniels explained.\n\nOften, a \"candling\" wildfire that's engulfed the crowns of a conifer forest will fall back down to ground level when it hits a clump of aspen.\n\n\"If a fire is spreading toward a community and we know that there's a band of aspen trees that it's going to have to cross before it approaches that community, the firefighters can use that band of aspen trees to make a stand and try to stop the fire,\" Daniels said.\n\nSpraying causes 'irreparable harm'\n\nThe research backs that up. One 2010 study conducted by a fire behaviour specialist with the federal government tested the fire-resistance of aspen by doing experimental burns of a forest that was split between conifers and trembling aspen.\n\nEven when there was a \"high-intensity flame front\" in the conifers \u2014 with flames leaping into the crowns of the trees \u2014 the fire \"failed to sustain itself upon entering the leafed-out hardwood portion of the plot,\" the study says.\n\nA test burn conducted by a federal fire behaviour specialist shows, at bottom right, how aspen can resist a wildfire spreading through jack pine and black spruce. (The Forestry Chronicle)\n\nDaniels believes B.C. needs to immediately change its forest management strategies to prioritize growth of aspen and other broadleaves.\n\n\"We're still stuck in the vortex where we're trying to maximize timber production from conifers, and that is causing irreparable harm in our forests, given climate change and the types of changes in forests and insects and fire that we're witnessing,\" she said.\n\nThe province has promised it's updating forest practices as new research becomes available. That includes some recent adjustments to the rules on aspens in the Cariboo-Chilcotin. Because the region is so dry and few aspen can survive anyway, they're not considered a threat to local conifers and don't need to be sprayed, a ministry spokesperson said.\n\nCalls for glyphosate ban\n\nBut critics like Steidle would like to see a complete end to the use of glyphosate in forests across the province.\n\n\"We need to ban glyphosate. There's no question,\" he said.\n\nOn a recent visit to the area of northern B.C. burned by the Shovel Lake wildfire this summer, James Steidle documented aspen trees that were left standing even though surrounding conifers were incinerated. (James Steidle)\n\nThe idea has some political support. Last week, Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver raised the issue during question period in the B.C. legislature, and asked how the province could justify spraying growing forests.\n\n\"The result is reduced plant diversity, leading to monocropped forests that are vulnerable to more frequent and destructive wildfires and beetle infestations,\" Weaver said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Why the White Cross Christmas campaign means so much for Islanders with mental health issues", "description": "Donations are being accepted for the annual White Cross Christmas campaign, which provides gifts to people on P.E.I. who have mental health issues.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-white-cross-christmas-campaign-1.4909806", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4909822.1542406956!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/sharon-claybourne.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T16:00:00Z", "content": "For some people on P.E.I., the gift they receive through White Cross Christmas campaign might be the only one under their tree on Dec. 25.

(The latency period for botulism can be longer in children.)\n\nShe was flown to the nearest hospital, in the Nunavik community of Puvirnituq (often referred to as POV), about 180 kilometres away, but then she was sent home before she had fully recovered.\n\n\"Janice's doctor from Montreal General [Hospital] actually had to request that this little girl has to be medevaced [back] to POV and kept there until she's better,\" Jobie Kasudluak testified.\n\nCoroner never contacted family\n\nThe coroner's office, whose mandate is to find the cause of death and determine if it could have been prevented, issued a report on Eva Kullula-Ookpik's death in April 2018.\n\nCoroner Steeve Poisson wrote that when she consulted the health clinic the two days before she died, food poisoning had been suspected. Her lab results, as well as her daughter and granddaughters' results, confirmed the presence of Clostridium Botulinum. Poisson confirmed the dried beluga had been the source of the bacterial contamination.\n\nHe concluded Kullula-Ookpik had died \"a natural death,\" and he made no recommendations.\n\nThe coroner's office never contacted anyone in the Kasudluak family to share its findings.\n\nAsked by the Viens commission's lawyer, Edith-Farah Elassal, whether he believes he and his wife would have been treated differently had they been white, Kasudluak didn't hesitate.\n\n\"She would have been on a medevac in an hour,\" he said, matter of factly. \"I've seen it with teachers and other white people in town \u2014 getting medevaced and coming back on a scheduled flight the next day.\"\n\nKasudluak said before his wife's sudden illness, he'd seen very ill Inuit people turned away from the clinic, only to die a day or two later, and he's seen it happen since.\n\n\"There's people still being sent home when they should have been sent to a hospital for observation,\" he said.\n\n\"I just hope that nobody ever goes through what we went through.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Dave Dormer", "title": "Beet brine again used to keep Calgary streets clear of snow and ice", "description": "As part of an ongoing pilot project, beet brine is being sprayed on city streets and pathways to prevent ice from forming.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-beet-brine-snow-ice-control-1.4909615", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4909669.1542402209!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/beet-brine-calgary.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:00:00Z", "content": "With the white stuff now blanketing the city, roads crews are again adding a shade of brown to some Calgary streets.

Sav Dhaliwal was chosen to head the regional government, which oversees water and waste issues, various parks and housing initiatives and an annual budget of over $700 million. For his services, he'll make an extra $77,474 per year on top of his council salary.\n\nDhaliwal defeated Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie and Delta Coun. (and former mayor) Lois Jackson in a secret ballot. Which means there's no public record of who voted for Dhaliwal or what their reasons were.\n\nBut there is a backstory.\n\nNewly elected Metro Vancouver chair Sav Dhaliwal has formerly served as president of the Union of B.C. Municipalities and Lower Mainland Local Government Association. (Justin McElroy/CBC)\n\nDhaliwal as vice-chair\n\nWith former chair Greg Moore and vice-chair Raymond Louie gone from municipal politics, the last month has seen plenty of intrigue around who would fill those positions, both open for the first time since 2011.\n\nAs late as Wednesday evening, informed sources had been telling multiple reporters that Brodie would be nominated as chair and Dhaliwal as vice-chair.\n\nThe pairing had a certain logic to it: after a municipal election season with so much turnover of mayors, Brodie was the longest-standing leader left in Metro Vancouver (running Richmond since 2001), and is generally seen as a steady presence.\n\nMeanwhile, Dhaliwal has been a Burnaby councillor since 2002, but had stints as president of the Lower Mainland Local Government Association and Union of B.C. Municipalities \u2014 important regional experience some councillors don't get.\n\nWhen asked whether plans for his nomination had changed, Dhaliwal was somewhat evasive.\n\n\"I was ready for either one of them, but I had decided a couple of days ago to pursue it [position of chair] really vigorously and talk to people and feedback was good,\" he said, portraying his win as merely good fortune.\n\nThe turning point, however, was just 24 hours before the vote.\n\nDelta Mayor George Harvie casts his secret vote for vice-chair of Metro Vancouver. (Justin McElroy/CBC)\n\nContentious Mayors' Council\n\nThe day before was the first meeting of the Mayors' Council, where the big item on the agenda was Surrey's request to cancel light rapid transit in Surrey and prioritize a SkyTrain extension to Langley.\n\nIn the end, the mayors mostly agreed, but language around the timeline for design, consultation and procurement work \u2014 and therefore, ultimate approval \u2014 was softened, after concerted criticism by Brodie.\n\n\"I have to say that I think this approach is setting a very, very dangerous precedent,\" he said at one point.\n\n\"Surely, we're going to have the same depth of analysis to change this decision to SkyTrain as we had to make it the LRT for Surrey Newton Guildford.\"\n\nIn his response, McCallum's annoyance at SkyTrain to Langley being slowed down by procedural amendments was made clear. And multiple mayors told CBC News that in the hours after that meeting, conversations began to pick up about someone other than just Brodie being nominated for chair.\n\nSurrey Mayor Doug McCallum, left, and Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart, right, have made it a priority early in their terms to work together. (Justin McElroy/CBC)\n\n(Surrey + Vancouver) > everything else\n\nBecause of the secret ballot, we can't say for sure where the votes went.\n\nBut we can say Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart has been very open about his desire to have a strong political alliance with Surrey Mayor Doug McCallum.\n\n\"As the mayors of the two biggest cities in the region, it's our job to try and speak to the region as well as we can,\" said Stewart, in a joint media scrum with McCallum after the Mayors' Council meeting.\n\nVotes on regional boards are weighted by population of each municipality, so by voting as a block, Surrey and Vancouver hold close to a majority on Metro Vancouver and the Mayors' Council.\n\nAnd by nominating Dhaliwal as chair, Burnaby Mayor Mike Hurley gains some political capital with Dhaliwal and his party \u2014 the Burnaby Citizens Association \u2014 which holds seven of eight seats on council.\n\nWhatever the reasons \u2014 and whatever the voting \u2014 Dhaliwal is now the chair of Metro Vancouver. And Malcolm Brodie is on the outside looking in.\n\nIt may not be the most altruistic way of choosing a chair.\n\nBut altruism is a word rarely heard in politics."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Diana Swain", "title": "Fighting fake news from within: The Houston Chronicle investigates one of its own former reporters", "description": "When a veteran reporter was accused of making up dozens of sources used in his articles, the Houston Chronicle set about investigating itself.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/theinvestigators/houston-chronicle-journalism-1.4909037", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4909356.1542404773!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/texas-generic.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:00:00Z", "content": "Mike Ward was no rookie.

In effect, one reporter was alleging another was deliberately reporting fake news.\n\n\"We immediately started within our newsroom to check a limited number of stories to see if that indeed were the case,\" said acting executive editor Steve Riley.

But, given extensive online and database searches, no trace of them could be found. In a story and an editor's note published last week, the newspaper said it had fully retracted eight stories and posted corrections for more than 60 others.\n\nThe editor's note said in part: \"These are challenging times for our country, and for journalism. That makes it all the more important that readers trust that we will ferret out the truth, even if it concerns ourselves.\"\n\nPast examples fake reporting\n\nIt's certainly not the first time a reporter has been accused of making up quotes. It's not even the first time this month. On Wednesday, Playboy Magazine in Germany fully retracted an article written by freelance journalist Marcel Anders about composer Ennio Morricone.\n\nThe magazine unreservedly apologized to its readers \"for failing to save you from this farce of an interview.\"\n\nThe made-up quotes apparently included criticisms of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. Morricone won an Oscar for the musical score he created for Tarantino's film, The Hateful Eight. He was quoted referring to the director as a \"cretin\" who makes \"derivative movies.\" Morricone claims he said no such thing.\n\nThe most famous example of journalists inventing material must be that of Jason Blair, the New York Times reporter found to have made up not only quotes but extraordinary details in his 2003 reporting on a string of sniper shootings in the Washington, D.C. area. He was fired and later wrote a book about substance abuse and a diagnosis of bipolar disease he believes contributed to his actions.\n\nVeteran reporter and former Austin bureau chief Mike Ward joined the paper in 2014. (The Houston Chronicle)\n\nRiley said Ward has refused to respond to the newspaper's questions about why so many people he quoted don't appear to exist and said it's simply not a question anyone would have thought to ask him in the past.\n\n\"It's just not an average ordinary thing for us to look at a reporter and say, give me the phone number and the email of this person you quoted from Tomball, Texas because we're going to make sure they exist,\" Riley said.\n\nAt a time when journalists are fighting both allegations of fake news and the spectre of those who try to hoax the media into printing false information, Riley admits it's been hard on the Chronicle's staff to discover the fake material was coming from inside the newsroom.\n\nHe said restoring trust between the newspaper and its readers started with being transparent about what was learned. Restoring trust among colleagues may be a lengthier process.\n\n\"We're still having discussions about what we want to do going forward,\" the editor said. \"But it's safe to say that we will be making sure that reporters collect and keep the contact information for everybody they use as sources in their news reporting.\"\n\nAlso this week on The Investigators with Diana Swain, Anu Singh and Makda Ghebreslassie talk about their discovery for CBC News: Marketplace that food couriers for home delivery apps often don't have equal protection under workplace compensation coverage.

The Redblacks shocked the Stampeders two years ago in Toronto to claim the championship. Calgary has played in back-to-back Grey Cup games, only to lose both in dramatic fashion. The Stampeders did win the Grey Cup in 2014, however.\n\nQB battle key in East\n\nThis final showdown of the season between Hamilton and Ottawa at 1 p.m. ET has all sorts of drama surrounding it. The two teams have met three times this year, with the Redblacks always victorious.\n\nBut clear the slate in the playoffs \u2014 it's a one-game showdown in the nation's capital.\n\nOttawa is hosting the East Final for the third time in the last four years. Since returning to the league five years ago, the team has been nothing short of sensational. Should the Redblacks beat Hamilton on Sunday, it will be their third Grey Cup appearance.\n\nIt's hard not to mention what happened the last time these two teams met in the East Final in Ottawa during the 2015 season. With time ticking down and the Redblacks pinned deep in their own end, Henry Burris connected with Greg Ellingson for a 93-yard touchdown that sent Ottawa to the Grey Cup.\n\nIf Ottawa is going to make it back to the championship, quarterback Trevor Harris must repeat his stellar regular-season play. He was the backup quarterback when the team won in 2016 behind Burris.\n\nBut it's Harris's team now and he has a massive opportunity on Sunday.\n\nFor, as poised and confident as Ottawa seems going into the East Final, Hamilton has all sorts of swagger right now after a beatdown of the B.C. Lions at home in the East semifinal by 40 points.\n\nQuarterback Jeremiah Masoli threw for three first-half touchdowns and helped his team cruise to the victory. He threw the second most yards of all quarterbacks during the season and was given the division's most outstanding player nod.\n\nThis marks Hamilton's third appearance in the East Final in the last six years \u2014 made even more remarkable considering the team was 0-8 to begin last season and has turned things around in a hurry with head coach June Jones at the helm.\n\nThe Ticats are looking to get back to the Grey Cup for the first time since 2014 when the team thought it had beaten Calgary, only to have a late Brandon Banks punt return touchdown called back on a penalty. They also lost the championship game in 2013 to the Saskatchewan Roughriders.\n\nPressure on Stamps\n\nCalgary has been in this exact same situation so many times before. In fact, the Stamps have hosted a home playoff game and made the West Final seven consecutive years.\n\nThey've been dominant.\n\nBut then there's the Grey Cup. The past two seasons have ending in bitter disappointment. An overtime loss to Ottawa two years ago, and a late interception against Toronto last year, ended Grey Cup dreams for the Stampeders.\n\nCan this third time be the charm? The Stamps have to make it past Winnipeg first. There's no denying the capability of the Stamps' Bo Levi Mitchell. In a one-game showdown, there aren't many other quarterbacks in the league a coach would prefer to lead their team.\n\nWinter wonderland in Ottawa....

But in its final game of the season and needing a win to secure a berth in the West Final against B.C., the Stampeders were brilliant. Perhaps the mini-slide to end the season was the wake-up call Calgary needed going into the biggest game of the year this Sunday at 4:30 p.m. ET.\n\nMeanwhile, Winnipeg is on a roll.\n\nThe Bombers have won six out of their last seven games, including a tough playoff win on the road in Regina last Sunday.\n\nAndrew Harris ran wild and Matt Nichols avoided mistakes \u2014 a clean football game for a Winnipeg team playing its best football at exactly the right time.\n\nThis is the first time the two teams will meet in the playoffs since the 2001 Grey Cup in Montreal \u2014 Calgary won that game 27-19. This marks Winnipeg's first West Final appearance since 2002 when they played the Edmonton Eskimos. The Bombers have a playoff road record of 22-32 all time.\n\nFor the Bombers, this season is about snapping that nasty Grey Cup drought of 28 years. For the Stamps, this season is about salvaging a competitive window that's yet to yield the ultimate prize.\n\nThe Grey Cup will be played Nov. 25 in Edmonton."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Angela Bosse", "title": "New resource development minister sets sights on turkey hunt", "description": "Wild turkey numbers have been growing slowly for years, and it may not be long before New Brunswickers are able to hunt them.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-resource-development-minister-wild-turkey-hunt-1.4907486", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4907557.1542313409!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/wildturkey.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T13:00:00Z", "content": "Wild turkey numbers have been growing slowly for years, and it may not be long before New Brunswickers are able to hunt them.

Those are places where it's easiest for the birds to find food all year long.\n\n\"It's pretty easy to find wild turkeys in Charlotte county and also certain areas of Carleton county.\"\n\nWhile Wilson hasn't tracked the numbers himself, he said the species does seem to be doing better in certain areas than it ever has.\n\nMike Holland, the new energy and resource development minister, is a former board member of the Canadian Wild Turkey Federation.

(Submitted by Jim Wilson)\n\n\"They have become habituated to the wild, they seem to be more hardy and able to cope with some of the conditions that we have,\" Wilson said.\n\nTurkeys don't migrate like other birds, Wilson said, but they do expand their range by walking, which could explain their slow growth in New Brunswick.\n\n\"It may be that they've made their way through some of the coniferous forests that don't have a lot of food for them by walking along hydro lines or even pipelines, gas pipelines, that would have deciduous foliage and deciduous shrubbery and be kind of be almost a roadway that would bring them in the direction of New Brunswick.\"\n\nWilson said he isn't a biologist, so he doesn't know for sure what effect the growing turkey population might have on the ecology of the province, but the fact that they've been able to survive suggests they've filled a niche in the environment.\n\n\"If it's a gradual thing and they are doing it on a natural basis \u2026 I would think it wouldn't necessarily be negative for other forms of wildlife.\"\n\nHolland said it's his department's responsibility to gather data and manage any wildlife species in the province, including turkeys.\n\n\"What we've got is a species that is unchecked, unmanaged and basically we're not following through on that.

About 15,500 people are part of the Mali mission now, which began after a rebellion in the north and a coup in the capital in 2012 resulted in a surge of violence.\n\nCanadian peacekeepers have so far conducted four emergency evacuations in Mali.

It's about supporting our communities up there. We're looking at this from a whole-of-government approach.\"\n\nSajjan pointed to investments in Arctic offshore patrol vessels and satellites with greater coverage as two examples of government efforts to \"sustain our ability to respond in the North.\"\n\nThe Canadian military has had increased presence in the Arctic over the past several years.

But Canada's Chief of the Defence Staff General Jonathan Vance says there's no need to panic \u2014 at least, any more than we used to.\n\n\"I don't think we should be more worried than we have been before,\" he said Friday. \"The world is technically more at peace by some metrics than it has been in the 20th century.\"\n\nWhew. But wait ...\n\nVance didn't sugarcoat the threats Canada is facing, telling Chris Hall that NORAD \u2014 the U.S./Canada bi-national organization charged with monitoring continental airspace and maritime warning and control \u2014 needs to be modernized in order to counter what he called \"threat vectors.\"\n\n\"Weapons are being modernized by potential adversaries, the rate of activity is increasing, the nature of Russian activity, their intent. It means that we must be able to protect Canada first,\" Vance said.\n\nVance said the updating of NORAD is ongoing, with both the U.S. and Canada \"convening to begin the process of determining what a modernized NORAD is.\" But the process will take time.\n\nUntil then, Vance said, the military is continuing to look \"holistically\" at the larger security issue.\n\n\"We have to think about new ways to deal with these threats. Not everything is a shoot-down type of scenario. We have to watch technology, those things that at a strategic level could cause potential harm to our countries,\" he said.\n\n\"There continues to be an absolute certainty that conventional warfare remains a potential threat, so we must exercise and be trained to respond to that, but just doing that alone isn't sufficient.\"\n\nThat's not quite the reassuring message Canadians are hoping to hear. But Vance said he remains confident in the direction of the country's armed forces.\n\n\"I'm confident that executing the [defence] policy, the spirit and intent of that policy, will put us in a position to approach mid-century as a credible force,\" he said.\n\nAnd he remains committed to the job.\n\n\"It's hard, it can be dangerous. What we do is important for the country and the nature of the preservation of our values. That job is a good one to do. It's an honourable thing to do.\"\n\nCanada's Chief of the Defence Staff doesn't pull any punches in this interview with Chris, discussing the 'threat vectors' currently facing Canada, from challenges for NORAD to mass migration and Chinese posturing in the South China Sea. 9:09\n\n'We see conflict and challenge everywhere'\n\nUS soldiers from the 2d Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion are pictured in a LAV-25, an eight-wheeled amphibious armored reconnaissance vehicle, during the Trident Juncture 2018, a NATO-led military exercise, on October 30, 2018 in Byneset near Trondheim, Norway. - Trident Juncture 2018, is a NATO-led military exercise held in Norway from 25 October to 7 November 2018.

The construction of the landfill was a Saint John YMCA-YWCA employee's justification for telling a co-worker to 'f--k right off' in 1996.

You've been on my f--kin' case all day and I'm f--kin' sick and tired of it.\"\n\nHenry then dared Graham to go ahead and \"fire him,\" a request Graham instantly obliged.\n\nWhen a court allowed the firing, Henry appealed.\n\nHeat of the moment\n\n\"Vulgarities exchanged between co-workers may be tolerated in one work environment, but not in another,\" wrote Justice J.T.

A third judge, Justice Wallace S. Turnbull, dissented.\n\nIn that case, VanBuskirk said, there was evidence that the employee and his boss made \"use of some hard language toward each other.\"\n\n\"It appears that the Court of Appeal, or at least the majority of the Court of Appeal, feels that the behaviour was reprehensible but not sufficient to justify dismissal for just cause.\"\n\nA third judge, Justice Margaret Larlee, allowed the appeal and directed the dealership to pay Henry $14,200, plus interest and costs.\n\nRisks greater than reward\n\nFolks with a swearing problem, however, increasingly need to check themselves if they don't want to run afoul of coming anti-harassment legislation in the province.\n\nWe live in rude times VanBuskirk said \u2014 and \"each person has to elevate our game, so that we're behaving in a way that's more respectful to each other.\"\n\nWhat is it with politicians and one-finger salutes?

The worker filed an unfair labour practice claim with the Manitoba Labour Board.\n\nMcGuire organized weekly protests outside the Osborne location during the Sunday brunch rush in an effort to get the worker rehired.

(Ron Boileau/CBC)\n\nThat lack of protection is one of the reasons why labour activists support unionization among restaurant workers, but it's also one of the reasons why organizing restaurant workers into a union is so difficult.\n\nHigh turnover rates and odd shift schedules, which make it difficult for workers to communicate and build solidarity, also hamper the ability of restaurant workers to organize, says Emily Leedham, an organizer with the Manitoba chapter of Fight for $15 and Fairness, which advocates for a $15 minimum wage.\n\n\"It's an injustice because workers should have a union in any workplace, because your employer ultimately controls your life,\" she said.\n\nUnions decertified\n\nPast efforts to unionize restaurants in Winnipeg have met with mixed results.\n\nTwo Taco Bell/KFC locations on Regent Avenue West and on Portage Avenue near Unicity received union certification in September and October 2016, respectively. However, the certificate for the Portage Avenue locationwas revoked in June 2018.\n\nA Tim Hortons location on Portage Avenue near Wall Street was certified in June 2015, followed by two other Tim Hortons locations on Lombard Place and Graham Avenue in August and September 2017, respectively. The certificate for the Portage Avenue location was revoked in November 2017.\n\nIn order to decertify a union, at least 50 per cent of employees in the bargaining unit must sign a petition and submit an application to the Manitoba Labour Board. If the board is satisfied that the application hasn't been instigated by the employer, it then holds a vote on whether to decertify the union.\n\nThe small size of many restaurants also presents a challenge for unions, which often look for workplaces with 100 employees or more in order to justify the effort and expense involved in holding a union drive, Leedham says.\n\nWorkers 'content'\n\nJonathan Alward, director of provincial affairs for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, challenges the notion that restaurants don't organize into unions because workers are in a precarious situation.\n\n\"Our research has shown in the past that generally, employees, especially in those smaller business, like many restaurants, are the most content,\" he said.\n\nThe fact that many restaurants are small and close-knit means employees have better relationships with their employers and communicate better than in larger workplaces, Alward says. Many of the people working in restaurants, especially younger workers, choose to do so because it offers flexibility.\n\n\"Contrary to popular belief, a lot of these people in these workplaces are paid well, they enjoy the work that they're doing, they don't necessarily feel like it's a precarious workplace and I think that's reflective of the fact that we don't have a lot of unionized restaurants across the province.\"\n\nSecret ballots\n\nIf employees feel they don't have a good relationship with their employers or are unhappy with their working conditions, they have an option to form a union, Alward says.

It was an inescapable issue for her because she has a life-threatening allergy to dairy and a sensitivity to eggs.\n\n\n\n\"When I was younger I'd have birthday cakes that I could cut \u2014 and not eat,\" she said.\n\nSo when Littlejohn-Myers was 12, she started to take her grandmother's recipes and experiment, modifying it by omitting eggs and swapping out other ingredients to try to re-create what she was missing out on.\n\nA 'huge response'\n\nWith time, she refined her baking skills. At work she would bring in her dairy and egg-free creations for her co-workers and found they loved the treats. It prompted Littlejohn-Myers to start seriously looking at it from a business perspective, and in 2012 it came together as Moo-Less Morsels.\n\n\n\nAt first she attended the smaller fairs, like Claire's Craft Fair. Now her delectables can be found at the St. John's Farmers' Market, Coleman's grocery on Newfoundland Drive and the newly-opened restaurant, The Green Kitchen.\n\nThe response Moo-Less Morsels has gotten has been huge, she said. \"Last year I found, really was the turning point.\"\n\nErin Littlejohn-Myers has a dedicated room off her kitchen, complete with a refrigerator and baking supplies. (Elizabeth Whitten)\n\nHer repertoire covers a wide range: cakes, cookies, scones and bread. \"I'll try anything,\" said Littlejohn-Myers, though she hasn't had any luck replicating a cheesecake yet. Her husband will often taste-test a product before it's approved, she explained, because he knows how the original version is supposed to taste.\n\nI love Moo-Less. This is who I am, and I think that's what makes me different as well. - Erin Littlejohn-Myers\n\nMoreover, what might have been unexpected boon to her business is that a lot of her desserts are vegan-friendly, which drew in new clientele.\n\nThere have been a few challenges when it comes to creating allergy-sensitive foods.\n\nFor one thing, it can be costly. \"People say, 'Oh my god, well your products should be cheaper, there's no dairy, no egg in it.'\" said Littlejohn-Myers. However, she said it can be more expensive and harder to find dairy-free ingredients, like chocolate chips. As well, she has to take precautions to avoid cross-contamination.\n\nAllergy standpoint, cross-contamination\n\nTofutti sour cream is a common feature in her desserts, but it's hard to get at local supermarkets because a lot of vegans buy it as well.\n\nIn the end, Littlejohn-Myers worked out a deal with a supermarket to buy it in cases to ensure her own supply. \"I've really outgrown what I've started here because I need to have more,\" she said. In fact, a side room off the kitchen of her home is dedicated to her baking supplies, including its own fridge and a shelf of non-perishable food items.\n\nFrom her perspective, customers trust her because she shares their food allergies and concern over what she eats. And Littlejohn-Myers is meticulous when it comes to her products.\n\nLittlejohn-Myers worked out a deal with a local supermarket to buy Tofutti sour cream by the case, to ensure a steady supply. (Elizabeth Whitten)\n\n\"I get data sheets from companies. I research what else is in the area, what else is used on the line because where I'm coming from an allergy standpoint, I need to know for the cross- contamination risks,\" she said. \"So I can't say something is guaranteed dairy and egg-free unless I know where that ingredient is coming from.\"\n\nSince Moo-Less Morsels is a specialty bakery, Littlejohn-Myers also wants to be educational. There are times when she'll be at her booth and will be approached by a parent of a child who has been recently diagnosed with a food allergy and doesn't know the questions to ask or where to get information.\n\n\n\nIn the future, Littlejohn-Myers plans to expand the business beyond her kitchen and hire someone to help out with the baking. While a bricks-and-mortar operation isn't in the works for the moment, she is looking at getting her products into more stores across the province.\n\n\"I love Moo-Less. This is who I am, and I think that's what makes me different as well. It's my story.

If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.\n\nThe Canadian Paediatric Society is calling for a ban on flavoured e-cigarettes after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sounded the alarm on a rise in teen vaping, describing it as an \"epidemic.\"\n\nThe number of U.S. high school students who say they've used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days is 78 per cent higher this year than last year, according to the latest National Youth Tobacco Survey, a joint study by the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For younger students in middle school, the increase was almost 50 per cent.\n\nIt all adds up to more than 3.6 million American minors using e-cigarettes in 2018 \u2014 1.5 million more than in 2017, the FDA says.\n\n\"These data shock my conscience,\" said FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb in a statement, noting that a big problem appeared to be \"youth appeal and youth access to flavoured tobacco products.\"\n\nThe variety of candy, dessert and fruit flavours now available make vaping a sweet proposition for young people, says the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nLike their Canadian colleagues, American pediatricians wanted a total ban on flavoured e-cigarettes. They were disappointed when, despite Gottlieb's dramatic remarks, the FDA didn't issue one.\n\n\"Flavours are really among the most compelling reasons that kids use these things. There have been some really robust studies,\" said Dr. Rachel Boykan, a pediatrician in Stony Brook, N.Y., and member of the academy's tobacco control executive committee.\n\nAdolescents are especially susceptible to nicotine addiction through vaping, says Dr. Rachel Boykan, a pediatrician on the tobacco control executive committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics. (American Academy of Pediatrics)\n\nRather than an outright ban, the FDA said it is restricting where flavoured e-cigarettes can be sold. With the exception of mint or menthol, U.S. stores can only sell flavoured vaping products in areas where people under the age of 18 can't enter.\n\nSo will Health Canada, which previously banned menthol cigarettes in an effort to curb tobacco use among youth, heed the call from pediatricians when it comes to e-cigarette flavours?\n\nIn short, no.\n\n\"While Canada and the U.S. have both recently regulated the vaping marketplace, the situation is not the same in the two countries,\" Health Canada spokesperson Maryse Durette said in an email.\n\nHealth Canada bans \"the promotion of flavours that may be appealing to youth, such as candy and dessert flavours,\" Durette said.\n\nBut it will not ban the flavours themselves, she said. And it won't implement restrictions on where those flavours can actually be sold, as the U.S. did. In addition to dedicated vaping stores, the products are available in Canadian gas stations and convenience stores.\n\n'Less harmful alternative'\n\nRestrictions on flavours could hinder the point of approving vaping products in this country in the first place, Health Canada says \u2014 which is to reduce cigarette and cigar smoking.\n\n\"Flavours help make vaping liquids palatable to adult smokers seeking a less harmful alternative to tobacco,\" Durette said. \"Therefore, the use of flavours in vaping liquids is not prohibited under the TVPA [Tobacco and Vaping Products Act].\"\n\nThe act prohibits retailers \u2014 in stores or online \u2014 from selling any kind of vaping products to youth under 18.\n\n\"Health Canada has a rigorous compliance and enforcement program in place to monitor vaping manufacturers', importers' and sellers' compliance,\" said Durette.\n\nNot good enough, says the Canadian Paediatric Society.\n\n\"While we are pleased that several of our recommendations \u2014 specifically the bans on e-cigarette advertisements and merchandise that appeal to youth \u2014 are reflected in current Canadian laws, even stronger rules and enforcement are needed,\" the society said in a statement.\n\nRisk to teens\n\nWhatever benefits e-cigarette flavours may offer adult smokers are outweighed by the harm they can do by attracting minors, argues Boykan.\n\nAdolescents are more vulnerable than adults to addiction, Boykan said, and the e-cigarette \"pods\" that are popular now \u2014 such as those produced by vaping giant Juul Labs \u2014 have high concentrations of nicotine.\n\n\"They like this thing, they tried it, now they're addicted,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to the risk of addiction, nicotine is \"really not safe for the adolescent brain,\" Boykan said, noting that research suggests it has potential long-term effects on cognition and memory.\n\nYouth <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ECigarette?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ECigarette</a> use surged during 2017-2018, erasing a previous decline.

A spokesperson for the children's hospital CHEO said they've only seen one case since January 2015.\n\nHowever, in Colorado, where cannabis edibles are legal, health-care visits involving accidental ingestion did rise after legalization, according to a paper published by the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in the U.S.\n\nIn 2014, when recreational cannabis became legal in the state, the emergency room at the Children's Hospital Colorado saw 14 cases of accidental ingestion, according to the report.\n\nThere was even a jump in 2009, when the state expanded the legalization of medical cannabis. That year, eight children showed up to the children's hospital emergency room, while in the previous four years, the hospital had seen no cases at all.\n\nResearchers also found that cannabis-related calls to poison control centres have risen by around 30 per cent in states where cannabis is legal. As a result, the OPC is anticipating an increase in calls in Ontario as well, Hudson said.\n\nA Health Canada spokesperson said the organization is keeping tabs on any cases of accidental ingestion involving kids, and is coordinating with regional poison control centres to monitor cannabis-related calls.\n\nMy child has ingested cannabis \u2014 what do I do?\n\nIf you suspect that your child has ingested cannabis, do not induce vomiting, Hudson said. It's an ineffective way of ridding the body of contaminants, and it may cause damage to the child's airways and soft palate.\n\n\"Instead, give the child some sips of water to drink, or clear fluids,\" she said. \"Something to help flush the substance from the mouth so you're able to assess whether they can drink or swallow.\"\n\nCall the Ontario Poison Centre at 1-800-268-9017.\n\nIf your child is having difficulty breathing or appears to be in medical distress, call 911, Gopalan said.\n\n\"If you think you're having a life-threatening emergency, call 911 and then ask questions later,\" he said. \"No one is going to fault you for calling 911.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "\u00c9ric Grenier", "title": "Why Doug Ford's Franco-Ontarian cost-cutting could spell trouble for Andrew Scheer", "description": "Doug Ford has built a wedge between francophones and his government in Ontario \u2014 and it could frustrate Andrew Scheer's hopes of gaining ground in Quebec.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-scheer-ford-1.4908611", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4884898.1540936242!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ont-ford-scheer-20181030.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T09:00:00Z", "content": "What's been called a \"sad day for Franco-Ontarians\" presents a challenge for Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer not only in Ontario but in every part of the country where francophones live.

But they also have great hopes of wooing Quebec voters \u2014 hopes that could be dashed if Scheer is unable to reconcile his support for Ford with his pitch to the francophone voters now angered by Ford's actions.\n\nIn its fiscal update on Thursday, Ford's government announced it would be cancelling a project to build a long-awaited French-language university in Toronto and would be abolishing the position of the French language services commissioner.\n\nThese decisions hit Franco-Ontarians hard and the reaction has been swift and furious. The front page of Le Droit, a major Franco-Ontarian newspaper, called it a \"black day for francos.\" Francophone organizations and associations across the province have denounced the move and say they are prepared to contest it in the courts.\n\nBut French-speakers in Ontario weren't the only ones who took notice. In New Brunswick and Manitoba, concerns are being raised about what it signals for the francophone minorities in those provinces.\n\nThis is an especially sensitive issue in New Brunswick, where a new Progressive Conservative government is taking office that is dependent for survival on the People's Alliance, a party that wants to roll back some parts of the province's Official Languages Act.\n\nQuebec's French-language media \u2014 which normally would pay little attention to a provincial fiscal update in Ontario \u2014 also jumped on the news. Le Devoir reported the decision under the headline, \"Doug Ford sacrifices Ontario francophones.\" Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al, a widely-read and generally conservative-leaning paper, called it a \"sad day.\"\n\nQuebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault, a small-c conservative himself, also expressed his concerns and said he would take up the issue with his Ontario counterpart. The mayor of Quebec City \u2014 the municipality at the centre of the region where most of the Conservatives' seats in the province are located \u2014 denounced the move as mean-spirited and provocative.\n\nStuck between Ford and a hard place\n\nIt all puts Scheer in a difficult position. Ford's Progressive Conservative government in Ontario is not only ideologically aligned with the federal Conservatives, it's in lockstep with Scheer's campaign against the federal carbon tax.\n\nQuebec Conservative MPs were quick to say on Friday that their party would always stand up for francophones, though they did not go so far as to say that they would stand against the actions of the Ontario government. But if Scheer and his party don't do more to show that they are not aligned with Ford's policy toward Franco-Ontarians, that could cost them support among French Canadians across the country.\n\nQuebec isn't the only place where the francophone vote is decisive, although it is a province where the Conservatives have hopes of making gains. The party is polling in second place in Quebec and stole a seat away from the Liberals in the Chicoutimi\u2013Le Fjord byelection earlier this year.\n\nFrancophones make up at least a fifth of the population in all 78 of Quebec's ridings and a majority in 65.\n\nBut outside of Quebec, there are four ridings with majority francophone populations \u2014 three in New Brunswick and one in Ontario. There are another 14 ridings \u2014 in New Brunswick, Ontario, Nova Scotia and Manitoba \u2014 where francophones make up at least 10 per cent of the population. Half of those ridings voted Conservative the last time the party won a majority government in 2011; they would be key to any Conservative victory in 2019.\n\nOffside on the carbon tax\n\nIt's not likely that being seen as close to the Ford government will do Scheer many favours in the 96 ridings across the country with significant francophone populations.\n\nScheer has very publicly allied himself with Ford, Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney (who may become Alberta's premier after next spring's provincial election) in his fight against Trudeau's carbon tax. He may prove reluctant to take Ford to task over a separate issue that he'd prefer to avoid altogether.\n\nThat alliance could compound the potential for problems facing Conservatives in Quebec. Quebec will not be affected by the federally-imposed carbon tax; the province already has a cap-and-trade system in place.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer, centre, gives the thumbs up with Richard Lehoux, right, candidate in the Beauce riding, Saturday, November 3, 2018 in St-Elzear Que. (Jacques Boissinot/THE CANADIAN PRESS)\n\nBut voters in Quebec are worried about climate change. Polls show that it rates as an issue most highly in Quebec, putting the environment and climate change among the top issues for voters in the province.\n\nThe Liberals' plan to put a price on carbon is also more popular in Quebec than anywhere else in the country. A recent Angus Reid Institute poll put approval of the plan at 69 per cent.\n\nMainstreet Research not only found support for the plan higher in Quebec than elsewhere, it reported that 77 per cent of Quebecers told the polling firm they strongly or somewhat agreed that \"it is more important for the government to solve the issue of climate change even if that means that the economy suffers.\"\n\nThat puts Scheer at risk of being out of step with Quebecers in the next federal election on one major issue \u2014 a risk that could be amplified if francophones also sense the Conservative leader is unwilling to distance himself from Ford's approach to funding services for Franco-Ontarians."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Katharine Starr", "title": "Defence minister confirms Mali mission will not be extended", "description": "Canada's peacekeeping mission in Mali will end in July, said Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, responding to reports that the UN has asked Canada to extend its mission.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-mali-un-mission-not-extending-defence-minister-sajjan-1.4909120", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4721783.1529971594!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mali-canada-20180625.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T09:00:00Z", "content": "Canada's peacekeeping mission in Mali will end in July as planned, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has confirmed. \"The United Nations is working with other nations to look at replacing us,\" Sajjan told Chris Hall in an interview airing today on CBC Radio's The\u2026 [+4250 chars]", "fulltext": "Canada's peacekeeping mission in Mali will end in July as planned, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has confirmed.\n\n\"The United Nations is working with other nations to look at replacing us,\" Sajjan told Chris Hall in an interview airing today on CBC Radio's The House.

That's 27 per cent less than what writers made three years ago, and a whopping 78 per cent less than they made in 1998.\n\nThe report comes in stark contrast to the glossy literary awards season, where champagne flows and prizes that sound lucrative are given out, culminating with the $100,000 Giller Prize, which is handed out this Monday.\n\nEven for established authors, tales of financial hardship are increasingly common.\n\n\"As it happens, my husband has to give up work for health reasons, so it would save me from a financial emergency,\" said Kathy Page of her nomination for the $50,000 Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize.

Even then, \"it still doesn't add up to the income of a middle-tier banker for one year.\"\n\nReasons for decline\n\nThe Writers Union of Canada attributes the decline in authors' incomes to a combination of factors. John Degen, the organization's executive director, attributes the particularly steep drop-off in the last few years to the rise of free photocopying of written material by educational institutions.\n\nBefore the Copyright Modernization Act of 2012, educators had to a pay a fee for all the photocopying they would do in a year, a fee that was redistributed as royalties to authors whose work students were reading. But once the Act deemed educational copying as fair dealing, that income for writers was gone.\n\n\"This is really, really destroying an integral, crucial market for Canadian writers,\" said Degen.\n\nAdditionally, the publishing industry has contracted in recent years, with some houses folding and others, like Penguin and Random House, conglomerating into one. That means fewer venues for writers to publish their work.\n\nJohn Degen is the executive director of the Writers' Union of Canada. (CBC News)\n\nOn top of all that, there's what Degen calls a \"bestselling mentality\" among publishers. At one point, a promising writer would get a two- or three-book deal with a publisher, allowing the author to fail but still keep writing. Now, said Degen, many publishers are focused only on those books that are sure to sell well right away.\n\n\"It's really hollowed out the developmental level of writers, the middle class of writers, you either hit it big right away, or you don't stay in the industry.\"\n\nWriting as a labour of love\n\nAccording to Degen, many authors are choosing to leave the industry altogether. But many others, in spite of increasing financial hardships, are finding ways to survive.\n\nAt the Toronto Reference Library, a Writers' Union-organized talk called Get That Grant packs a room, with writers new and seasoned trying to learn how to supplement their income with grants so they can keep writing.\n\nA young science fiction author, Rebecca Diem, is there to figure out how to branch out into more literary fiction. Her background as a self-published genre author has already given her some entrepreneurial skills needed to navigate the tricky landscape.\n\nAuthor Rebecca Diem attends a grant seminar from the Writers' Union of Canada, held at the Toronto Reference Library on Nov. 13, 2018 (CBC News)\n\n\"I have a growing fan base, a lot of my income comes through e-book sales, convention appearances, and through Patreon campaigns. One of the things that authors in Canada are doing right now is trying to broaden our reach, make sure we're diversifying our streams of income,\" said Diem.\n\nTough though it is, writing is a labour of love, according to Charles Foran.\n\n\"If you need to do it, you need to do it. If it is bound up with your self-conception, with your sense of your worth, with your sense of purpose,\" said Foran. \"The rest of it is, curiously, just conditions you accept.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Martin Patriquin", "title": "Canada's rushed rollout of legal cannabis has been a gift to the illegal market", "description": "All 12 stores in Quebec have closed Monday to Wednesday as a result of supply shortages.

For the opposition Conservatives, it must be a particularly cruel joke: Trudeau flits about the world in shirtsleeves, earnestly putting the torch to Stephen Harper's populist legacy, thanks in no small part part to pot legalization.\n\nYet while legalization has been a political victory for the Liberal government, the hasty rollout of the policy has been decidedly mixed, resulting in often-conflicting laws, massive supply chokepoints and comparatively high prices for what has been a relatively cheap, ubiquitous if illegal product for decades. All of this has been manna for the black market, the very entity Trudeau sought to eliminate in the first place.\n\nExactly why the Liberal government rushed legalization is likely a political, not social, consideration. Given that legalization has met the most resistance amongst older, suburban voters \u2014 who figure heavily in the considerations of both the Liberals and opposition Conservatives \u2014 having the question on the ballot would arguably detrimental to Liberal fortunes in 2019. Hence the importance of legalizing it well before the 2019 election.\n\nDemand for illegal cannabis remains high in Quebec, in large part because the province's bricks-and-mortar outlets and online store simply can't keep up. (Graham Hughes/Canadian Press)\n\n\"Victor,\" which isn't anywhere close to his real name, is thankful for botched legalization. He has grown weed in a far-flung Montreal exurb upwards of three decades. Apart from being an immediate threat to his bottom line, legalization has meant a potentially detrimental effect on his freedom.\n\nOn Oct. 16, the day before Canada became the largest market for recreational marijuana in the world, an arrest meant a short jail sentence at worst. Today, under the enhanced laws designed to stamp out people like him, getting caught could mean 14 years in prison.\n\nYet nothing has changed for the 49-year-old father of two since legalization roughly a month ago. \"Business as usual,\" he said from a Montreal coffee shop recently, plunking a thumb-sized example of his bounty on the table as evidence.\n\nHis production yields, supply lines and clients are identical, as is the $100 price he commands for an ounce of Headbanger, Banana Punch and Mimosa, the three lines he grows, cures and clips throughout the year. He is currently and happily \"100 per cent out of stock,\" he says.\n\nHalf of N.B.\u2019s cannabis stores were closed Monday. 0:51\n\nIn Quebec, which as in many provinces is home to a government monopoly on the sale of legal marijuana, Victor has carved out a niche in the chaotic wake of legalization. Demand remains high, in large part because the province's bricks-and-mortar outlets and online store simply can't keep up.\n\nAll 12 stores have closed Monday to Wednesday as a result of supply shortages. A rotating Canada Post strike has throttled online sales deliveries. Meanwhile private storefronts, though illegal in Quebec, are as close as a Google search away.\n\nIt has only reinforced the often-well deserved stereotype that government is slow moving, bureaucratically blinkered and unconcerned about anything beyond the hovering of tax dollars.\n\nMoreover, these stores sell the mass-produced Bud Light of weed, complete with tax stamp. Blessed with low overhead and unburdened by the taxman, Victor and other smaller, patently illegal weed purveyors sell VSOP cognac at half the price. \"We also offer a money-back return policy. You don't get that in the stores,\" Victor says.\n\nIn Quebec, illegal weed also remains in demand for another reason. The province's newly-elected Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec government has vowed to increase the required age to buy legal weed to 21. The CAQ says it did so for public health reasons. Yet the restriction will essentially render the decidedly weed-hungry 18-to-20 demographic captive to the black market. The province has furthered the black market's appeal by prohibiting the growing of marijuana for personal use \u2014 a provision specifically allowed in the federal law.\n\nQuebec's differing regulations underscore another bugaboo of Canada's legalization. Each province has a different take on the federal law. For example, New Brunswick treats marijuana much like alcohol, only allowing it to be consumed on private property. In neighbouring Nova Scotia, weed is more akin to tobacco, consumable in certain public places. How to enforce cannabis-related driving laws is equally patchwork. if only because \u2014 as a top RCMP officer recently told the CBC \u2014 there isn't yet a viable roadside test available to police.\n\nVictor knows legalization will ultimately suffocate much of the illegal market. But he says the cacophony resulting from the abrupt, politically motivated legalization will allow him to eke out a very decent living for the foreseeable future. \"I sell a higher end product for a better price than the government,\" he says. \"It's that simple.\"\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

(Farrah Merali/CBC)\n\n'More and more common'\n\nSusan Lipkins, a New York-based psychologist who specializes in hazing, says it's not restricted to all-boys schools and that the practice, along with all types of bullying, can be found in different types of schools.\n\n(Just this month, for example, a video surfaced showing kids bullying a Nova Scotia teen with cerebral palsy; making him lie down in a stream as classmates walked over him).\n\nBut, based on her research, Lipkins says sexualized hazing is becoming \"more and more common\" and is spreading through the internet.\n\nA 2014 Bloomberg News report found that in the U.S., more than 40 high school boys were sodomized with objects by their teammates in over a dozen alleged incidents reported in that past year, compared with about three incidents 10 years earlier.\n\n\"I think it is becoming more the norm. It's being accepted as a norm, as a rite of passage,\" Lipkins said. \"It's becoming normalized for the kids and they are not really attending to how awful and usually how illegal these events are.\"\n\nThe whole concept of hazing, she said, is to maintain the status quo and hierarchy. And the quickest way to make a rookie or new person on a team or group feel their lack of power and status is to humiliate them as quickly as possible.\n\n\"When you humiliate somebody in the sexual arena \u2014 it's instant, and there's no way of fighting back,\" Lipkins said.\n\nGirls are also sexually hazed by teammates, but such incidents among boys are much more common, she said.\n\nNot part of 'sport ritual'\n\nMeanwhile, some former students took to social media to defend St. Mike's.\n\nThe allegations are \"not part of sport ritual at the school,\" said one, Dante Fantauzzi, on Twitter, and don't \"reflect what they teach and what goes on in a locker room.\"\n\nThe recent news \"does not in any way reflect the school community, brotherhood, rituals, or integrity of my brothers,\" tweeted Akil Thomas, another former student.\n\nDebra Pepler, a psychology professor at York University's LaMarsh Centre for Child and Youth Research, said she believes incidents such as those alleged to have occurred at St. Mike's are an anomaly.\n\n\"I do think that extreme forms of bullying and \u2014 if, in fact, pictures were taken and shared on cellphones, this is quite an unusual act.\"\n\nThis is not part of sport ritual at the school. The programs teach excellence and respect for your brothers.

It found that the rates of youth reporting bullying in 2014 were 62 per cent lower than they were in 2006.\n\n\"So, generally, there's a trend for less bullying or fewer youth being involved in bullying than 12 years ago,\" she said.\n\nHowever, boys do report that they've engaged in bullying at a higher rate than girls and report that they've sexually harassed others \u2014 both boys and girls \u2014 at a higher rate than girls do, Pepler said.\n\nWhile you may expect that an all-boys school would have a higher rate of bullying, the likelihood of such actions depends on the climate within the school that's been established by school administrators and teachers, she said.\n\n\"If it's a climate where caring for others and being socially responsible is reinforced and constantly upheld, then there would be less likely to be bullying in the school,\" Pepler said.\n\n\"If it's a climate that doesn't address inequities and exclusion and rejection and marginalization then it would be a school where you'd be more likely to see bullying.\"\n\nWith files from Ron Charles, Olivia Stefanovich and The Canadian Press"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jorge Barrera", "title": "Setbacks hit water treatment projects for Ontario First Nations", "description": "The situations in Neskantaga and Slate Falls are examples of the challenges Ottawa faces meeting its target to clear all long-term boil-water advisories in First Nations by March 2021.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/first-nations-water-treatment-setbacks-1.4909763", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4909791.1542405876!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/roy-moonias.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T09:00:00Z", "content": "The filtered water station by the motel overlooking Attawapiskat Lake is the only place Neskantaga First Nation residents can get clean water for free.

The company, commissioned by the Argentine government, began searching for the missing vessel Sept. 7.\n\nIt remained unclear what the next steps could be. In a statement to The Associated Press, Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Plunkett said authorities would have to determine how to advance. \"We would be pleased to assist with a recovery operation, but at the moment are focused on completing imaging of the debris field,\" he said.\n\nWithout adequate technological capabilities, however, Argentina would likely need to seek assistance from foreign countries or to pay Ocean Infinity or another company, potentially complicating its recent commitment to austerity. Argentina is currently facing a currency crisis and double-digit inflation that has led the government to announce sweeping measures to balance the budget and secure a financing deal with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAny move to recuperate the vessel would also be a logistically large and challenging undertaking based on the submarine's distance from the coast, its depth, and the kind of seabed upon which it is resting.\n\nVessel lost just over 1 year ago\n\nRelatives of crew members were determined to fight for the submarine to be quickly surfaced.\n\nIsabel Vilca, the half sister of crewman Daniel Alejandro Polo, told the AP that the discovery was just the beginning.

The San Juan was returning to its base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata when contact was lost.\n\nOn the anniversary Thursday, President Mauricio Macri said the families of the submariners should not feel alone and delivered an \"absolute and non-negotiable commitment\" to find \"the truth.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Aguad said that the vessel was found to be in an area that investigators had deemed \"most likely.\"\n\nOfficials showed images of the submarine, which was located on a seabed with its hull totally deformed.

(Argentina Navy via AP)\n\nThe German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in the mid-1980s and was most recently refitted between 2008 and 2014. During the $12-million US retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts said refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers, and even the tiniest mistake during the cutting phase can put the safety of the ship and crew at risk.\n\nThe navy said previously the captain reported on Nov. 15 that water entered the snorkel and caused one of the sub's batteries to short-circuit. The captain later communicated that it had been contained.\n\nSome hours later, an explosion was detected near the last-known time and place of the San Juan. The navy said the blast could have been caused by a \"concentration of hydrogen\" triggered by the battery problem reported by the captain.\n\n'Terrible tragedy'\n\nMacri promised a full investigation after the submarine was lost. Federal police raided naval bases and other buildings last January as part of the probe, soon after the government dismissed the head of the navy.\n\nArgentina gave up hope of finding survivors after an intense search aided by 18 countries, but a few navy units have continued providing logistical support to Ocean Infinity.\n\nOn Saturday, Plunkett tweeted the company's \"thoughts are with the many families affected by this terrible tragedy.\"\n\nOliver Plunkett, Ocean Infinity\u2019s CEO: \u201cOur thoughts are with the many families affected by this terrible tragedy.

The only way it could survive is if they really focus on local \u2014 local players.\"\n\nUnder-served market\n\nWhile Cyrenne acknowledged they'd be limited in terms of which players they can draft and trade for, he said Winnipeg is under-served by junior hockey.\n\nRick Brownlee, executive director of the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame, said the previous iteration of a Winnipeg WHL squad was \"almost destined to fail.\"\n\nAs Winnipeggers, we sometimes tend to be pessimistic when we get new things coming to us - Dayna Spiring, president and CEO of Economic Development Winnipeg\n\nFans didn't have time for shoddy hockey after their Jets, a dynasty in the late 1970s, was picked apart as a condition of the WHA's merger with the NHL.\n\n\"People were resentful that that's what happened to our beloved franchise, so there was not much of an appetite for a losing hockey team,\" Brownlee said. \"It showed at the NHL level and I think it trickled down.\"\n\nWith the city growing to 700,000 residents, he thinks Winnipeg can handle a WHL franchise if tickets are priced differently than the going cost for NHL and AHL games.\n\nBrownlee's concerned, though, for the future of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League's Winnipeg Blues, which have survived attendance woes for years. They are the only city team remaining in the MJHL.\n\nIf the Kootenay owners choose to uproot to Winnipeg, Hockey Manitoba's Peter Woods is confident they will know what they're getting into.\n\n\"I'm sure they've done their due diligence and they feel that there's a market there.\"\n\nHockey town\n\nDayna Spiring, president and CEO of Economic Development Winnipeg, said it'd be an interesting \"claim to fame\" if Winnipeg welcomes a NHL, AHL and a major junior team.\n\nThe last time that's happened anywhere was in Toronto in 2007, according to hockey historian Eric Zweig.\n\nSpiring said Winnipeg is clearly a hockey town, evidenced recently by the whiteout street parties during the Jets' Stanley Cup run this spring.\n\n\"As Winnipeggers, we sometimes tend to be pessimistic when we get new things coming to us,\" Spiring said. \"I think there are a lot of people that are going to do the business case and make sure the numbers make sense, but I think Winnipeggers will come behind their team.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Canadian Press", "title": "Headphones allowed: EQAO makes new resources available to students during tests", "description": "Students taking standardized tests in Ontario schools this year will be able to wear headphones and access some online calculators and language resources, Ontario's Education Quality and Accountability Office says.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/eqao-adds-resources-for-ontario-students-during-tests-1.4910120", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4910122.1542421427!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/student-headphones.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T02:42:46Z", "content": "Students taking standardized tests in Ontario schools this year will be able to wear headphones and access some online calculators and language resources, Ontario's Education Quality and Accountability Office says.

Among Grade 3 students, the EQAO says 61 per cent met the provincial standard in 2017-2018, down from 67 per cent in 2013-2014.\n\nMeanwhile, 45 per cent of Grade 9 students enrolled in the applied math course met the standard, while that figure stood at 84 per cent for those in the academic math course. Academic courses focus more on abstract applications of concepts, while applied courses focus on the practical.\n\nReid said the EQAO will continue to modernize its approach to testing, but will also ensure its assessments are rigorous.\n\n\"In the long-term, we're hoping to ... make it an environment that might be a little more fun for students and perhaps a little less stressful,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Prisoner recaptured in housing complex washroom after escaping RCMP custody in Lethbridge", "description": "A 46-year-old man is facing a new batch of charges after escaping police custody in Lethbridge and threatening officers with a knife as they tried to recapture him.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/lethbridge-escaped-prisoner-tased-1.4910107", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3987377.1530973164!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lethbridge-police.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T02:40:13Z", "content": "A 46-year-old man is facing a new batch of charges after escaping police custody in Lethbridge and threatening officers with a knife as they tried to recapture him.

During recess, educators are looking at things like student interaction and conflicts.\n\nOther Alberta educators have also been looking to Finland for inspiration.

He believes that council spends too much time in closed-door meetings beyond discussing legally permissible private sessions where personnel, land or legal matters are hashed out.\n\nMost longer closed sessions take place in the council boardroom, which is a short distance away from the council chamber.\n\nThis is the council boardroom where longer closed-door sessions happen. <a href=\"https://t.co/TK3F97dKr8\">pic.twitter.com/TK3F97dKr8</a> \u2014@CBCScott\n\nBut shorter private sessions take place in the council lounge, which is located on the other side of the wall, just behind where the mayor sits in the chamber.\n\nCushy chairs\n\nThe room features enough comfortable living room chairs for the 15 council members and additional guests. There is a desk for the clerk, a few tables, a TV monitor as well as a small kitchen and two washrooms.\n\nAn orange foot stool sits in front of one chair. Coun. Druh Farrell tweeted that it belonged to her.\n\nExcuse me but that\u2019s my footstool. \u2014@DruhFarrell\n\nThe lounge is a bit too comfortable for Farkas's liking.\n\n\"The way that the room is set up, in my mind, is it kind of encourages us to stay a little bit longer than we should,\" said Farkas, who joined council last year.\n\nOn this day, there were two paintings on the wall. One featured a pair of pandas while another was a view of Mount Allan, home of the alpine ski events for the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\nCity clerk Laura Kennedy said it's a functional meeting room but also a casual working space.\n\n\"It functions well for council, for the purpose they have designed it, and it's working well for them,\" she said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "U.S. man's confessions solve 4 long-unsolved murders", "description": "Investigators in two states say they've been able to close four unsolved murder cases because of confessions by a man being held in Texas who says he killed as many as 90 people over four decades.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/samuel-little-confessions-solve-4-cases-1.4909916", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4907825.1542318743!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/serial-strangling.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T00:07:48Z", "content": "Investigators in two U.S. states say they've been able to close four unsolved murder cases because of confessions by a man being held in Texas who said he killed as many as 90 people over four decades.

Little already was serving a life sentence in California when he was interviewed by a Texas investigator that resulted in the confessions.\n\nLittle provided details on two killings in Houma, Louisiana, \"that only the murderer would have known,\" according to an internal Louisiana State Police memo obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nDorothy Richard, 59, was found dead in 1982, and the body of Daisy McGuire, 40, was discovered in 1996. Both had been strangled.\n\nThe memo said Little has confessed to other killings in Louisiana and those claims are being investigated.\n\nIn Macon, Georgia, the Bibb County Sheriff's Office said in a statement issued Friday that Little's confessions allowed its investigators to close two murder cases, one from 1977 and another from 1982.\n\nIn the 1982 case, the body of Fredonia Smith was found in the backyard of a Macon home. She had been strangled. The 1977 victim has never been identified. Her skeletal remains were found at the edge of some woods in a local backyard.\n\nTwo Bibb County investigators travelled to Decatur, Texas, to question Little. The sheriff's office said he gave them specific details and information\" linking him to both slayings, and Smith's family was notified about the new developments."}]
