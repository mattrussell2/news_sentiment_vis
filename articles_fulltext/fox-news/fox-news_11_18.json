The manager was fired last week for refusing to make food for five black customers unless they paid in advance, saying they had failed to pay at the restaurant before. Tweets later emerged showing that at least one member of the customers had boasted about stealing and \"dining and dashing\" from restaurants in the past -- including Chipotle.\n\nSchalow sent the following statement: \"We have spent the last few days reviewing the evidence available to us regarding the incident in St. Paul, MN. Based on our review, we have offered our manager her job back. While our normal protocol was not followed serving these customers, we publicly apologize to our manager for being put in this position. We will work to continue to ensure that we support a respectful workplace for our employees and our customers alike.\n\nOur policy is to treat our customers and employees fairly and with respect at all times and under any circumstances. We will work with all our restaurant teams to ensure they are prepared to handle situations of this kind and know they have our full support. We are committed to doing the right thing and acting in a manner consistent with a thoughtful, fact-driven approach.\"\n\nOriginal story below:\n\nThe restaurant chain Chipotle announced Saturday that it had terminated one of its managers for suggesting in a viral video that five black customers were planning to order food without paying -- but on Sunday, the company acknowledged to Fox News that it was considering re-hiring the manager because her suspicions may have been well-founded.\n\nIn a series of video clips seen more than 3 million times on Twitter, a Chipotle customer in St. Paul, Minn., identifed as 21-year-old Masud Ali, and several friends are told by a manager: \"You gotta pay, because you\u2019ve never had money when you come in here.\u201d An employee adds, \"We're not gonna make food unless you guys actually have money.\"\n\nAs Ali and his friends complain about \"stereotypes,\" the videos show employees at the store claiming that the group had previously ordered food on two occasions without paying. The store manager also calls the police in the videos, which were recorded and uploaded by Ali.\n\nIn one video clip, the manager smiles and tries to ignore the men while they produce what appears to be cash, as proof that they can pay for their food. One of the employees visible in the kitchen is black.\n\n\"It sounded really racist \u2014 the way she said it was racist,\u201d Ali told Minnesota's Star Tribune newspaper on Friday. \u201cShe asked for proof of income as if I\u2019m getting a loan.\u201d On Twitter, Ali asked Chipotle: \"Can a group of young well-established African-American get a bite to eat after a long workout session?\u201d\n\nAli also posted the restaurant's phone number and address to social media. Within hours and under a deluge of criticism, Chipotle issued a statement implying that the manager had acted out of bias and announcing her termination.\n\nBut on Sunday, as tweets emerged showing that Ali had apparently made a habit of stealing from restaurants, Chipotle walked back its decision.\n\n\"Our actions were based on the facts known to us immediately after the incident, including video footage, social media posts and conversations with the customer, manager, and our employees,\" Chipotle Chief Communications Officer Laurie Schalow told Fox News on Sunday. \"We now have additional information which needs to be investigated further. We want to do the right thing, so after further investigation we will re-train and re-hire if the facts warrant it.\"\n\nDespite reports on Twitter late Sunday that the manager had received her job back, Chipotle confirmed to Fox News that \"nothing has changed from this morning. We are still investigating a few things.\"\n\n\"After further investigation we will re-train and re-hire if the facts warrant it.\" \u2014 Chipotle Chief Communications Officer Laurie Schalow\n\nIn a previous statement on Saturday, the company had said: \u201cWe are committed to treating all of our customers fairly and with respect. ... Regarding what happened at the St. Paul restaurant, the manager thought these gentlemen were the same customers from Tuesday night who weren\u2019t able to pay for their meal. Regardless, this is not how we treat our customers and as a result, the manager has been terminated and the restaurant is being re-trained to ensure something like this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nIn subsequent interviews, though, Chipotle representatives admitted that the manager might have been right in claiming that individuals in the group had ordered food just days before without paying once their order was completed. (As a matter of policy, Chipotle only provides food to customers upon payment, but store employees finish making orders before payment is requested at the register.)\n\n\u201cWe are not able to confirm that with 100 percent certainty,\u201d Schalow acknowledged in a statement to The Twin Cities Pioneer Press. \u201cWe asked Masud if he was in our restaurant on Tuesday and he said no.\u201d\n\nAnd almost immediately, it emerged that Ali had apparently spoken favorably of \"dining and dashing\" -- the practice of ordering food and not paying for it -- several times on Twitter in the past.\n\n\"aye man i think chopotle catchin up to us fam. should we change locations and yoooooo what should we do about the other thang,\" read a since-deleted post on Ali's account from 2016.\n\nIn 2015, he wrote that \"we finna goto Applebees and eat as much as we can and tip the nice lady 20cents and walk the f--- out.\"\n\nWhen another Twitter user objected, he replied that \"we're just borrowing the food for a couple hours\" as opposed to dining and dashing.\n\nLater that year, he opined that \"Dine and dash is forever interesting\" and discussed stealing Tabasco bottles from Chipotle.\n\nAnother post read: \u201cGuys we\u2019re borrowing food... that\u2019s it. And if the lady tries to stop you at the door don\u2019t hesitate to truck the sh-- out of that bi---.\u201d Ali has since deleted all of these posts.\n\n\"We finna goto Applebees and eat as much as we can and tip the nice lady 20cents and walk the f--- out.\" \u2014 Masud Ali\n\nAs those tweets surfaced over the weekend, Chipotle's media representatives, including Schalow, initially said that they had seen the tweets and would stand by their decision to fire the manager -- seemingly contradicting Schalow's statement to Fox News on Sunday.\n\nAccording to author Matt Palumbo, Schalow had previously claimed that the store's manager was justifiably terminated because she broke protocol by requiring payment before making the customers' food, regardless of her suspicions about the customers' intention to pay.\n\nPalumbo called Schalow's suggestion that Chipotle had not been aware of Ali's tweets when it fired the manager an \"absolute lie.\" (For her part, Schalow has reportedly said that other information -- and not simply Ali's tweets --was behind Chipotle's desire to reconsider the manager's fate.)\n\n\"The correct action to take would have been to make their food and not hand it over to them until they paid for it,\" Schalow had asserted as part of her justification for firing the manager, according to Palumbo.\n\nAli did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nThe episode follows several other high-profile incidents of alleged racism that have rocked the service industry. In May, Starbucks closed 8,000 of its stores for anti-bias training after two black men were arrested for trespassing in one of its Philadelphia shops. The store manager, who stopped working at Starbucks shortly after the episode, had called the police because the men remained seated in the shop without ordering anything, and refused to order something when asked.\n\nEarlier this year, a fired Chipotle manager who was accused of stealing $626 ended up winning nearly $8 million from the company in a wrongful termination suit."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tijuana protesters chant 'Out!' at migrants camped in city", "description": "Hundreds of Tijuana residents congregated around a monument in an affluent section of the city south of California on Sunday to protest the thousands of Central American migrants who have arrived via caravan in hopes of a new life in the U.S. Tensions have bu\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/tijuana-protesters-chant-out-at-migrants-camped-in-city", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-2cf85be6121e4da19320554924af3e47.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:48:26Z", "content": "TIJUANA, Mexico Hundreds of Tijuana residents congregated around a monument in an affluent section of the city south of California on Sunday to protest the thousands of Central American migrants who have arrived via caravan in hopes of a new life in the U.S. \u2026 [+4307 chars]", "fulltext": "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nHundreds of Tijuana residents congregated around a monument in an affluent section of the city south of California on Sunday to protest the thousands of Central American migrants who have arrived via caravan in hopes of a new life in the U.S.\n\nTensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road, and with many more months ahead of them while they seek asylum. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nOn Sunday, displeased Tijuana residents waved Mexican flags, sang the Mexican national anthem and chanted \"Out! Out!\" in front of a statue of the Aztec ruler Cuauhtemoc, 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from the U.S. border. They accused the migrants of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to Tijuana. They also complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an \"invasion.\" And they voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group.\n\n\"We don't want them in Tijuana,\" protesters shouted.\n\nA woman who gave her name as Paloma lambasted the migrants, who she said came to Mexico in search of handouts. \"Let their government take care of them,\" she told video reporters covering the protest.\n\nMost of the migrants who have reached Tijuana via caravan in recent days set out more than a month ago from Honduras, a country of 9 million people. Dozens of migrants in the caravan who have been interviewed by Associated Press reporters have said they left their country after death threats.\n\nBut the journey has been hard, and many have turned around.\n\nAlden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, told the AP on Saturday that 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision. \"We want them to return to Honduras,\" said Rivera.\n\nHonduras has a murder rate of 43 per 100,000 residents, similar to U.S. cities like New Orleans and Detroit. In addition to violence, migrants in the caravan have mentioned poor economic prospects as a motivator for their departures. Per capita income hovers around $120 a month in Honduras, where the World Bank says two out of three people live in poverty.\n\nThe migrants' expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million people to handle the influx.\n\nWhile many in Tijuana are sympathetic to the migrants' plight and trying to assist, some locals have shouted insults, hurled rocks and even thrown punches at them. The cold reception contrasts sharply with the warmth that accompanied the migrants in southern Mexico, where residents of small towns greeted them with hot food, campsites and even live music.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants' arrival an \"avalanche\" that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. Gastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx.\n\nMexico's Interior Ministry said Saturday that the federal government was flying in food and blankets for the migrants in Tijuana.\n\nTijuana officials converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000.\n\nSome from the caravan have diverted to other border cities, such as Mexicali, a few hours to the east of Tijuana.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S.\n\nTrump wrote that like Tijuana, \"the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\"\n\nHe followed that tweet by writing: \"Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Julie Watson contributed to this story from Tijuana."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Nicole Darrah", "title": "Kanye West donates $150G to family of black security guard killed by white officer", "description": "Rapper Kanye West donated $150,000 to the family of a black security guard who was fatally shot by a white police officer last week.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kanye-west-donates-150g-to-family-of-black-security-guard-killed-by-white-officer", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/ENT-Kanye-donation.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:39:34Z", "content": "Rapper Kanye West donated $150,000 to the family of a black security guard who was fatally shot by a white police officer in Illinois last week.

In a recent interview, the actor is opening up about the political divide in America and having to answer for his character\u2019s outspoken opinions.\n\nWhen ABC pulled the plug on the sitcom after six successful seasons, many wondered if the character of Mike Baxter\u2019s personal politics had something to do with the decision by the network to ax the right-leaning humor show. The series made its return on Fox for Season 7, where Allen and the writers pulled no punches when it came to skewering what he perceives to be an over-sensitive American left.\n\n\u201cI said there\u2019s nothing, especially in this area, that pisses people off more than a very funny conservative. A smart, funny conservative that takes shots and is certainly self-effacing. The left-wing point of view is so pervasive that they don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a point of view. It is just a point of view,\u201d Allen said in an interview with IndieWire. \u201cI think this character likes that, he likes to have another point of view. It makes him sharper and more interesting. But we don\u2019t push it. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve mentioned pro or con Trump once now.\u201d\n\nStill, despite his propensity for wanting to disrupt the general consensus of what\u2019s funny and politically correct, Allen admits that it\u2019s difficult when fans equate his personal beliefs to that of the character he plays.\n\n\u201cI did an interview and I said, \u2018Are you asking Mike Baxter this question, because you heard something about the Clintons that the writers had written?\u2019 Now, I\u2019ll put something behind it, because I think it\u2019s funny to make fun of people that are full of themselves. Liberals have a very small window of sense of humor about themselves, so I love poking at it. Two years ago, it was the conservatives, or whatever it is. But right now liberals, particularly progressives, hide behind large concepts. If you don\u2019t agree with them, if you don\u2019t agree with that position, then you hate women, and you hate gay people, and you hate pro-choice people, whatever. And I said that doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Allen has said that he wants to portray a conservative American on screen in a sitcom. However, he\u2019s also said that he also doesn\u2019t want \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d to be a completely political show, but rather a comedy about family."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Sri Lankan leaders' crucial talks fail to solve crisis", "description": "A crucial meeting among Sri Lanka's political party leaders on Sunday failed to reach a breakthrough to resolve the political turmoil that has engulfed the island nation for several weeks, opposition lawmakers say.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/sri-lankan-leaders-crucial-talks-fail-to-solve-crisis", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T18:47:11Z", "content": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka A crucial meeting among Sri Lanka's political party leaders on Sunday failed to reach a breakthrough to resolve the political turmoil that has engulfed the island nation for several weeks, opposition lawmakers say.

Wickremesinghe says he still has the support of a majority in Parliament.\n\nOn Sunday, president Sirisena chaired the meeting attended by Rajapaksa, Wickremesinghe and other political leaders. Talks came two days after the parliament passed the second no-confidence motions against Rajapaksa who has so far refused to accept the results of the motion and continues to perform as prime minister.\n\nAjith Perera, a lawmaker from Wickremesinghe's party, told reporters that Sunday's meeting failed to reach a breakthrough.\n\nHe said it is illegal for Rajapaksa and his government to stay in power after two no-confidence motions were passed against them. \"They are hanging on to power illegally.\"\n\nParliament turned violent when the no-confidence motions were taken up last week, with rival lawmakers exchanging blows, injuring several.\n\nOn Friday, lawmakers supporting Rajapaksa threw books, chairs and chili powder mixed with water to try to block the proceedings.\n\nHowever, speaker Karu Jayasuriya, using a microphone, conducted the proceedings while standing on the floor of Parliament, which for the second time passed a no-confidence motion against Rajapaksa and his government by a voice vote.\n\nJayasuriya first offered to take the vote by name but was unable to do so because of the commotion and opted for a voice vote. He then adjourned the house until Monday. Parliament passed the first motion on Wednesday, also by voice vote due to the clashes.\n\nRajapaksa says the vote should not have been done by voice. He also insisted the speaker had no authority to remove him and said he is continuing in his role as prime minister.\n\nSirisena, as the head of the government, has the power to appoint the prime minister.\n\nOn Sunday, Sirisena's office in a statement said he told the meeting of the party leaders that he would take a decision on the no-confidence motions \"only if a vote is taken by name of the Members or by electronic voting.\"\n\nSirisena has said voting on an important motion to change a government should not be done by a voice vote which he said he is not transparent.\n\nHarsha de Silva, another lawmaker Wickremesinghe's party criticized the meeting, saying Rajapaksa and his loyal lawmakers \"want to drag impasse along giving lame excuses of procedures\" as Rajapaksa does not have the majority in the 225-member house.\n\n\"Go, MR Go. For God's sake Go!,\" de Silva stated in his tweet. MR is the acronym for Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nRajapaksa, a former president, is considered a hero by some in the ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending a long civil war by crushing ethnic Tamil Tiger rebels. However, his time in power was marred by allegations of wartime atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was the health minister of Rajapaksa's government, before he crossed over to the opposition and contested the 2015 presidential election as the common opposition candidate backed by Wickmremesinghe's party. He defeated Rajapaksa and the duo have been political rivals since then.\n\nHis move to appoint Rajapaksa as prime minister astonished many."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Tyler McCarthy", "title": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs tweets public statement about ex Kim Porter's death - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Sean 'Diddy' Combs tweets public statement about ex Kim Porter's death Fox News Three days after it was confirmed that his ex, model Kim Porter, died, Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has made a public statement on the passing of the mother of his children.

Scott, a two-term governor of the state, said Nelson called him to \u201cgraciously\u201d concede and that Scott, in turn, thanked Nelson for his years of service. Scott has now won narrow victories in three statewide races since 2010.\n\n\u201cNow the campaign truly is behind us, and that\u2019s where we need to leave it,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe must do what Americans have always done: come together for the good of our state and our country.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump congratulated Scott on Twitter Sunday, saying that Scott \"was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida.\"\n\nNelson tweeted that \"things turned out a little differently than we had hoped, but I by no means feel defeated ...

Scott\u2019s lead narrowed to 12,603 votes after a statewide machine recount. The new numbers triggered an automatic hand recount under Florida law.\n\nAfter it became clear that the race between Nelson and Scott would head to a legally required recount, Nelson and Democrats filed several lawsuits that challenged everything from Scott's authority over the state's election division to deadlines for mail-in ballots.\n\nThe Nelson campaign managed to secure only one win in court. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker gave voters until 5 p.m. on Saturday to fix their ballots if they haven't been counted because of mismatched signatures. Nearly 5,700 ballots were rejected because signatures on ballot envelopes did not match signatures kept on file by election officials.\n\nWalker rejected a request by Democrats to automatically count all the ballots with mismatched signatures. He also rejected a request to waive deadlines for domestic mail-in ballots even if they had been mailed prior to Election Day. Under Florida law, ballots mailed inside the United States must be in election offices by 7 p.m. on Election Day in order to count. Overseas ballots are counted if they are received up to 10 days after the election.\n\nMarc Elias, the attorney who represented Nelson, acknowledged on Twitter that \"the margin narrowed, but did not close\" as a result of the recount.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Nelson\u2019s plans will be post-race. The 76-year-old was first elected to office in a state House district near Cape Canaveral in 1972. He\u2019s served three terms in the Florida House, six terms in Congress and was Florida\u2019s insurance commissioner after Hurricane Andrew swept the Miami area.\n\nThe recount was marred by a series of missteps, particularly in Broward and Palm Beach counties, that put Florida back in the national spotlight 18 years after the dramatic 2000 presidential election.\n\nAfter getting off to a slow start, embattled Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes boasted Thursday about making the state\u2019s deadline for machine recounts.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be at this point,\u201d she said Thursday afternoon.\n\nA few hours later, election officials were forced to admit the county had uploaded the results of the recount two minutes after the state\u2019s 3 p.m. cutoff -- making its machine recount tally void.\n\n\u201cBasically, I just worked my ass off for nothing,\u201d Joseph D\u2019Alessandro, Broward County\u2019s election planning and development director, said.\n\nD\u2019Alessandro said he had a hard time uploading the results in time because he wasn\u2019t familiar with the website used to send them to the secretary of state.\n\nWhen asked what would happen if Broward missed Sunday\u2019s deadline, county attorney Drew Myers inhaled deeply and told Fox News he couldn\u2019t even entertain the idea.\n\n\u201cThey have to make that deadline,\u201d he said.\n\nBroward\u2019s bungled recount efforts had many calling for Snipes to step down, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes failed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians\u2019 confidence in our electoral process,\u201d Bush tweeted on Monday. \u201cSupervisor Snipes should be removed from her office following the recounts.\u201d\n\nProtesters have been camped outside Broward\u2019s Lauderhill recount site since last Sunday.\n\nSome carried signs that read, \u201cCorrupt Snipes!!!

She\u2019s very competent but in a bad way.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Snipes said she\u2019s considering leaving after the recount.\n\n\u201cIt is time to move on,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t finalized that. I\u2019ll just check with my family. They\u2019ll tell me what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nLike Broward, Palm Beach County also missed its machine recount deadline.\n\nElection supervisor Susan Bucher said the county found \u201cdozens of precincts missing a significant number\u201d of votes and indicated there may be entire boxes of ballots that weren\u2019t counted, according to a report in the New York Times.\n\nShe also blamed the county\u2019s issues on mechanical errors and said the scanning machine overheated. It got so bad that she had to fly in two mechanics to fix the problem. The technicians, though, witnessed Palm Beach County workers jam a paper clip into the scanner\u2019s \u201center\u201d button to slow the high-speed scanner down. That action caused a short circuit that cut off the power.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Warner, who heard several legal challenges filed in connection to the recount, slammed state lawmakers and Palm Beach County officials for failing to anticipate election problems and said the state law on recounts appears to violate the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that decided the presidency in 2000.\n\n\u201cWe have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election, and we chose not to fix this,\u201d Walker said in court.\n\nWhile there have been no estimates yet on how much the 2018 recount will cost, past recounts have racked up a hefty bill.\n\nIn 2000, Citizens Against Government Waste released a report that estimated the costs associated with the state\u2019s recount efforts. CAGW estimated Palm Beach County blew through $25,000 a day and projected the 2000 recount cost in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties to be more than $2 million.\n\nFox News\u2019 Sarah Chakales, Ivonne Amor and Gregg Re contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Katherine Lam", "title": "Sonia Sotomayor: Brett Kavanaugh is part of Supreme Court \u2018family\u2019", "description": "Justice Sonia Sotomayor said newly appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh is part of the Supreme Court \u201cfamily\u201d who she will judge based on his work and not by what occurred during his controversial confirmation process.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sonia-sotomayor-brett-kavanaugh-is-part-of-supreme-court-family", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/rtx38jvl.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T18:19:20Z", "content": "Justice Sonia Sotomayor said newly appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh is part of the Supreme Court \u201cfamily\u201d whom she will judge based on his work and not by what occurred during his controversial confirmation process.

At the time she blamed a stomach ulcer.\n\nHere, in an exclusive extract from new autobiography Brutally Honest, Mel explains what really happened over those few dramatic days.\n\n--\n\nHere I am, 39 years of age, staring in a mirror in the en-suite bathroom of my rented house in Kensington, London, holding an open bottle of aspirin from the stash I\u2019ve stockpiled over the years, putting one pill after another into my mouth.\n\nAs each pill goes into my mouth, I ask myself: \u201cAre you sure?\u201d And I take another one. Ten, 20, 50, 100. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Thursday night. 11 December 2014. I\u2019ve come back from dinner with my husband Stephen. Tomorrow I\u2019m going to \"The X Factor.\"\n\nIt will be the red-carpet launch for the final weekend. I\u2019ll be wearing a beautiful dress, my hair and make-up will be perfect. But if you want the absolute truth, I don\u2019t care about any of it. My life is a mess and I want out.\n\nOne hundred and 20. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d 150. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\nBehind the glitter of fame, I felt emotionally battered, estranged from my family.\n\nI felt ugly and detested by the very man who once promised to love and protect me, my husband and manager Stephen.\n\nA man who after ten years of marriage now had a library of sex tapes that could \u2014 as we both well knew \u2014 ruin my career and destroy my family.\n\nI wrote frantic, disjointed notes for Phoenix, my eldest daughter, my soulmate \u2014 the girl who is little sister, friend and daughter to me.\n\nIt was going to be up to her to get my other little girls, Angel and Madison, to Leeds where they could all live with my mum.\n\nIn my head, in that moment, it was that simple.\n\nTwo hundred. \u201cNow what\u2019s going to happen, Melanie? STOP!\u201d As soon as I\u2019d swallowed that last pill, I knew I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere. \u201cMelanie! What the f--- are you doing? Get a grip!\u201d\n\nSuicide was not the answer. I had to make my life count. I had to get to a hospital. I had to get those pills out of my stomach before anything happened.\n\nMy head was spinning. All I thought was that I needed to get out of the room but for some reason, the door was jammed.\n\nI can\u2019t clearly remember what happened next but I remember throwing myself at the door, crashing my full weight against it.\n\nThose bruises on my face and shoulder everyone saw at \"The X Factor\" final three days later \u2014 most of them were caused by those moments trapped in that doorway.\n\nI can\u2019t remember the pain but I can still remember the fear, panic and absolute confusion in my head.\n\nThen everything started to go black and I collapsed to my knees. I could feel the life in me starting to drain away.\n\nAnd then nothing, silence. I lay semi-conscious on the bathroom floor and, with tears streaming down my face, drifting in and out of consciousness, waited to die.\n\nI remember getting to the hospital and calling Simon Cowell. I remember he didn\u2019t sound horrified, just calm, like he knew that\u2019s what I needed from him.\n\nI must have lost consciousness again. When I woke up, I was surrounded by doctors and nurses.\n\n\u201cMom. What the hell?\u201d Phoenix was standing by my bed. Furious, shaking, full of rage. Of all the memories from all those hours, it is the one that still floors me. \u201cWhy, Mum? Why? Why?\u201d It was the saddest moment of my life. All I ever want is for her to know how sorry I am, how lost I was and how I\u2019ll never, ever abandon her again.\n\nLooking at my daughter \u2014 distraught, devastated, angry \u2014 was the moment I knew the fightback had to start.\n\nThe situation with \"The X Factor\" was quickly sorted because it had to be \u2014 the semi-finals were going to be shown live in two days\u2019 time.\n\nTulisa Contostavlos would cover for me on Saturday night and be on standby for the Sunday final.\n\nDespite all the drugs I was being given, I was wired. The doctors kept telling me that I was in the High Dependency Unit and was seriously ill. I needed to get well.\n\nIf you think I was surrounded by friends, relatives, other concerned celebrities and flowers, you would be wrong. Thanks to my relationship with Stephen, I was pretty much on my own apart from my security, my hairdresser and Simon my publicist.\n\nEvery one of the Spice Girls tried to contact me. I couldn\u2019t speak to them. I wasn\u2019t ready, and I was too ashamed. My family also managed to track me down, but they were the last people I wanted to see.\n\nI remained trapped behind a wall of guilt, shame and worthlessness. I\u2019d been hit in the past, but bruises fade.\n\nMy doctor looked at me as if I was completely crazy when I mentioned in the very early hours of Sunday morning that I would be on \"The X Factor\" later that day.\n\n\u201cThat is not happening, Melanie,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you realise how serious your condition is. You are in intensive care. There is serious damage to your liver and kidneys.\u201d\n\nAs my doctor walked out of the room, I texted my stylist: \u201cSend me pix of all the dresses you\u2019ve got me for the final tonight.\u201d\n\nI had bruises round my eyes, my cheek was swollen, and I had massive dark welts on my arms from the constant stabbing at my weak, narrow veins with the IV drips.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got three perfect dresses with sleeves,\u201d said my stylist, nervously eyeing the welts and purple marks on my arms which were clearly showing through thick body foundation. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve picked the dress already. No sleeves.\u201d\n\nThe bruises were still visible as I put on a beautiful, long white silk dress, semi-sheer at the top then hugging every curve of my body.\n\nI would stand proud in this stunning white dress, the marks of my agony all over me. I asked for my hair to be pulled right back from my face. I needed to be seen. I needed all those bruises to be seen.\n\nMy message to the world and to my husband was going to be VERY CLEAR. I wanted people out there watching to be my witnesses. I took off my vast, square-cut diamond wedding ring. A ring I\u2019d worn on \"The X Factor\" a few weeks before to show the world what a solid couple Stephen and I were.\n\nThe next hour was a blur of adrenalin and throwing myself into the drama of the show. Simon winked.\n\nLouis covered up whatever shock he was feeling.\n\nI let go of Louis\u2019 hand and lifted my left hand into the air, directly in the centre of the camera focus, knowing the TV audience, the press and, most important of all, Stephen would see my ring-less finger. \u201cF--- you big time,\u201d I thought.\n\nAs the show played out, I focused entirely on the battle between Ben Haenow and Fleur East.\n\nThey were both fabulous, talented and committed. They were both out there singing because they wanted a whole new life to start. I was with them all the way.\n\nI joked with Simon and Louis, and tried not to ignore Cheryl\u2019s looks of concern every time the camera was off us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m OK. I\u2019m OK.\u201d As ever, on that stage \u2014 any stage \u2014 I felt fully myself. Untouchable. Melanie Brown. Wonder Woman.\n\nI get off stage, smiling at everyone, happy for Ben (who won), happy for Fleur.\n\nI\u2019m happy I didn\u2019t collapse, happy I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve sent my message to Stephen. There\u2019s no going back. I\u2019m going to leave him, get a divorce. I\u2019m going to be free.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Sun."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Gary Gastelu", "title": "2019 Ford Mustang GT Bullitt test drive: It's on target - Fox News", "description": "Fox News 2019 Ford Mustang GT Bullitt test drive: It's on target Fox News The 2019 Mustang GT Bullitt is \u201cawesome,\u201d and that has nothing to do with its connection to the Hollywood thriller it gets its name from.

He had no idea who Steve McQueen was, but boy did he flip when he saw the car. So did my son, who is literally colorblind and thought it was red. This eliminated the possibility that he\u2019d heard me talking about a dark highland green Mustang driven by a guy who dared to coordinate a navy blue turtleneck with a brown blazer and intuitively made the association.\n\nFor many of those old enough to have seen the film on the silver screen, it\u2019s an instantaneous one, and you\u2019ll find them gathering around the Bullitt like moths to a flame. It\u2019s good news for Ford that they\u2019re not alone, because they aren\u2019t getting any younger and the movie isn\u2019t anywhere near the Netflix Top 100, even though it\u2019s celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.\n\nHeck, even Steve McQueen\u2019s granddaughter Molly told me at the unveiling of the car in January that she\u2019d only seen it \u201conce or twice,\u201d and I\u2019m not so sure if she ever did because \u201conce or twice\u201d is the least believable answer to pretty much any question about things you\u2019ve done. She did say that she\u2019d watched the chase on YouTube \u201ca bunch of times,\u201d however, which sounds about right.\n\nFord got the new Bullitt very right. The visual ties to the on-screen machine go beyond the paint to the blank grille, the silver-rimmed and black-spoked wheels, and the chrome trim around the grille and side windows, none of which are available on any other Mustangs. Neither are the \u201cBullitt\u201d logos. There are six scattered around the car, which is probably five too many. Frank Bullitt was a plain-clothes detective, after all.\n\nBut the Bullitt is far from just a paint and stickers tribute. It\u2019s essentially a GT Premium \u2013 complete with a digital gauge cluster and heated/ventilated seats \u2013 that\u2019s also equipped a bunch of goodies from the Mustang\u2019s optional Performance Pack. Among them are stronger shocks, big Brembo brake calipers, wide and sticky Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires and a limited slip differential, which only comes connected to a six-speed manual transmission that\u2019s topped by a white cue ball shifter. The front end is finished with a chin splitter that adds menace, while the rear spoiler is deleted to maintain some semblance of undercover style.\n\nThe Bullitt gets its own engine, too. It\u2019s a special version of the GT\u2019s 5.0-liter Coyote V8 that\u2019s been fitted with the freer-breathing intake manifold and throttle body from the Mustang Shelby GT350\u2019s motor, which gives it a 20 hp boost to 480 hp and makes the Bullitt the most powerful GT yet.\n\nIt also has an exhaust system that's tuned to make it sound as much like the pipes on the 1968 390 GT from the movie as possible. It won\u2019t trick a cinephile, but it gives the Bullitt a unique and very loud voice. That is unless you switch it into quiet mode, which is enabled by a bypass valve, but even then it\u2019s not exactly on the hush-hush.\n\nPrices start at $47,590, which is well in line with the sum of its parts. Ford will build as many as it can sell, but it\u2019ll just be around for the next two years.\n\nThe only options available are an adjustable MagneRide suspension that you definitely want; an electronics package with things like a blind-spot warning system, an upgraded stereo and built-in navigation that you probably want; and snug, high-back Recaro sports seats that you should probably try on first.\n\nMYSTERY OF STEVE MCQUEEN'S 'BULLITT' MUSTANG FINALLY SOLVED:\n\nThey\u2019re snug and a good call if you plan to take the Bullitt to the track, but it's more of a street fighter and the standard buckets are just the thing for a double surveillance shift. Either way, it's equally quick and that engine loves to growl all the way up to its 7,400 rpm redline. If the sharp handling is any different than a regular GT\u2019s, I can\u2019t say I noticed or cared, because it\u2019s spot-on without being too rough for the road. You could cruise around comfortably in it all day, and you can bet that I did. This kind of balance is where Mustangs shine.\n\nAnd you can get an even shinier Bullitt, because Ford also offers it in black. I don\u2019t get why, but honestly, they should unlock the full color palette. The combination of that engine and the performance bits is beautiful. Ford did build one in Kona Blue for an auction to benefit the Juvenile Diabetes Association, but I'd love to see what it actually looks like in red.\n\n----------\n\n2019 Ford Mustang GT Bullitt\n\nBase price: $47,590\n\nType: 4-passenger, 2-door, rear-wheel-drive coupe\n\nEngine: 5.0-liter V8\n\nPower: 480 hp, 420 lb-ft torque\n\nTransmission: 6-speed manual\n\nMPG: 15 city/24 hwy"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Montana deer test positive for brain wasting disease - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Montana deer test positive for brain wasting disease Fox News Montana wildlife officials say three deer in Blaine County have tested positive for a brain wasting disease.

ESPN, citing a league source, reported that Dorsey was considering bringing in Rice for the spot.\n\nRice, 64, would become the first woman to ever interview for an NFL head-coaching job if the team follows through. After the report emerged, the Browns released a statement from Dorsey saying that Rice has not been discussed as a candidate.\n\n\"Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is a great leader, possesses the highest possible character and also happens to be a Browns fan,\" Dorsey said in a statement. \"I have the utmost respect and admiration for all she\u2019s accomplished and was honored to meet her for the first time earlier this season. Our coaching search will be thorough and deliberate, but we are still in the process of composing the list of candidates and Secretary Rice has not been discussed.\"\n\nRice, who served as secretary of state from 2005 to 2009, is an avid football fan and a lifelong Browns fan. In a statement posted on her Facebook page, Rice said she's not ready to coach, but \"would like to call a play or two next season if the Browns need ideas!\"\n\n\"I love my Browns -- and I know they will hire an experienced coach to take us to the next level,\" Rice said. \"On a more serious note, I do hope that the NFL will start to bring women into the coaching profession as position coaches and eventually coordinators and head coaches. One doesn't have to play the game to understand it and motivate players. But experience counts -- and it is time to develop a pool of experienced women coaches.\"\n\nA team source told ESPN that a potential interview didn't mean that Rice would ultimately get the job, but the organization was interested in talking with her about what she could bring to the team.\n\n\"She's an amazing person,\" one Browns source told ESPN.\n\nBesides being pictured wearing Browns\u2019 gear, she was also spotted on the field with owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam before Cleveland's game in Oakland on Sept. 30, ESPN reported. In 2012, she was part of a print campaign for women's NFL apparel and appeared in ads wearing a Browns jersey.\n\n\"Supporting the @NFL and showing my passion for the @OfficialBrowns! Can't wait for the season to start!\" she posted on Twitter at the time.\n\nThe Browns fired head coach Hue Jackson last month one day after a blowout loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Jackson was 3-36-1 with the Browns in fewer than three full seasons. The 2017 Browns were the second team in NFL history to finish the season winless.\n\nWhile there was previous speculation that Rice could eventually become commissioner of the NFL, Rice was a member of the inaugural College Football Playoff selection committee, where she worked from 2013 to 2016.\n\nEX-NFL PLAYER WIELDS SWORD DURING ARGUMENT AT YOUTH BASKETBALL EVENT, POLICE SAY\n\nAt the time, Rice was considered to be a surprising choice because she had never worked directly in college athletics, though when she was provost at Stanford the athletic department was under her supervision, Fox Sports reported at the time.\n\nRice called herself a \u201cstudent of the game,\" and that she \"experienced plenty of heat in my life.\"\n\n\u201cWhat I can hopefully bring to this committee is critical judgment and the willingness to work real hard \u2026 to put the best four teams on the field,\u201d she said when joining.\n\nEarlier this year, the NCAA announced it adopted a series of policy changes with the intention of cleaning up corruption in college basketball based on recommendations made by a commission led by Rice.\n\nLA RAMS RAISE MORE THAN $1 MILLION FOR CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE VICTIMS\n\nRice has voiced her opinion on NFL matters before, saying in a 2017 interview on Fox News that NFL players should voice their concerns about racial injustice without \"alienating\" people amid kneeling protests during the national anthem.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News' Dana Perino on \"The Daily Briefing,\" Rice said that players' goal should be to bring as many people to their side as possible and explain what injustices they are protesting.\n\n\"I personally believe very strongly that the American flag stands for the millions of people who have sacrificed over the years,\" she told Fox News at the time, adding that the flag is a \"symbol of the fact that we have greater freedoms.\"\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Travis Fedschun", "title": "Argentine Navy submarine may have 'imploded'; photos show wreckage on sea floor - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Argentine Navy submarine may have 'imploded'; photos show wreckage on sea floor Fox News The Argentine submarine that was lost deep in the sea with 44 crew members on board may have suffered from a partial implosion close to the seabed, a senior offi\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/argentine-navy-submarine-may-have-imploded-photos-show-wreckage-on-sea-floor", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ara-san-juan.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T16:46:52Z", "content": "The Argentine submarine that was lost deep in the sea with 44 crew members on board may have suffered from a partial implosion close to the seabed, a senior official said Sunday as officials released photos of the wreckage.

Enrique Balbi said the working theory was that the vessel had partially imploded while at sea, deep down near the seabed, Sky News reported.\n\nPhotos released on Sunday showed the wreckage of the submarine in the Atlantic Ocean, with sections of the vessel lying on the ocean floor. Parts of its propellers were buried and debris was scattered up to 230 feet away.\n\nThe pieces of the submarine, which included a propeller and the sub's bow with torpedo launching tubes, had been \"crushed inwards,\" according to Balbi.\n\nThe sub's discovery was announced just two days after families of the missing sailors held a one-year commemoration for its disappearance on Nov. 15, 2017. The San Juan was returning to its base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata when contact was lost.\n\nThe navy said previously the captain reported on November 15, 2017 that water entered the snorkel and caused one of the sub's batteries to short-circuit. The captain later communicated that it had been contained.\n\nARGENTINE NAVY SUBMARINE FOUND 2,600 FEET DEEP IN ATLANTIC ONE YEAR AFTER DISAPPEARING\n\nHours later, an explosion was detected near the time and place where the San Juan was last heard from. The navy said the blast could have been caused by a \"concentration of hydrogen\" triggered by the battery problem reported by the captain.\n\nThe German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in the mid-1980s and was most recently refitted between 2008 and 2014. During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced.\n\nAfter announcing the discovery of the submarine, Defense Minister Oscar Aguad disclosed that the country will be unable to recover the vessel because Argentina lacks \"modern technology\" capable of \"verifying the seabed.\"\n\nIt remained unclear what the next steps could be.\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press, Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Plunkett said authorities would have to determine how to advance. \"We would be pleased to assist with a recovery operation, but at the moment are focused on completing imaging of the debris field,\" he said.\n\nNavy commander Jose Luis Villan urged \"prudence,\" saying that a federal judge was overseeing the investigation and would be the one to decide whether it was possible to recover a part or the entirety of the ship.\n\nCREW IN MISSING ARGENTINA SUBMARINE REPORTED A FIRE, LEAK IN FINAL MESSAGE\n\nWithout adequate technological capabilities, Argentina would likely need to seek assistance from foreign countries or pay Ocean Infinity or another company. The country is facing a currency crisis and double-digit inflation that has led the government to announce sweeping measures to balance the budget and cement a financing deal with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBut relatives of crew members were determined to fight for it to be quickly surfaced.\n\nIsabel Vilca, the half-sister of crewman Daniel Alejandro Polo, told the AP that the discovery was just the beginning.\n\n\"We do know they can get it out because Ocean Infinity told us they can, that they have equipment,\" said Luis Antonio Niz, father of crew member Luis Niz. \"If they sent him off, I want them to bring him back to me.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Barnini Chakraborty", "title": "Bill Nelson concedes Florida Senate race to Rick Scott after manual recount", "description": "Florida\u2019s long-time Democratic Sen.

Rick Scott Sunday, drawing the hotly contested race to represent the Sunshine State to a close after 12 days of legal wrangling.\n\nAccording to the Florida Secretary of State's office, Scott led Nelson by approximately 10,000 votes after the state's 67 counties completed machine and manual recounts\n\nNelson, who served three terms in the U.S. Senate, met his match in Scott, who launched a competitive campaign for Florida votes. Scott, a two-term governor of the state, said Nelson called him to \u201cgraciously\u201d concede and that Scott, in turn, thanked Nelson for his years of service. Scott has now won narrow victories in three statewide races since 2010.\n\n\u201cNow the campaign truly is behind us, and that\u2019s where we need to leave it,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe must do what Americans have always done: come together for the good of our state and our country.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump congratulated Scott on Twitter Sunday, saying that Scott \"was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida.\"\n\nNelson tweeted that \"things turned out a little differently than we had hoped, but I by no means feel defeated ... I\u2019ve had the privilege of serving the people of Florida for most of my life. It\u2019s been a rewarding journey and a very humbling experience. No one could be more blessed.\"\n\nScott's victory also marks the first time in more than a century that Florida has two Republican senators representing them in Washington. The state is scheduled to certify results in the race on Nov. 20.\n\nElection Day results showed Nelson trailing Scott by more than 56,000 votes. Scott\u2019s lead narrowed to 12,603 votes after a statewide machine recount. The new numbers triggered an automatic hand recount under Florida law.\n\nAfter it became clear that the race between Nelson and Scott would head to a legally required recount, Nelson and Democrats filed several lawsuits that challenged everything from Scott's authority over the state's election division to deadlines for mail-in ballots.\n\nThe Nelson campaign managed to secure only one win in court. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker gave voters until 5 p.m. on Saturday to fix their ballots if they haven't been counted because of mismatched signatures. Nearly 5,700 ballots were rejected because signatures on ballot envelopes did not match signatures kept on file by election officials.\n\nWalker rejected a request by Democrats to automatically count all the ballots with mismatched signatures. He also rejected a request to waive deadlines for domestic mail-in ballots even if they had been mailed prior to Election Day. Under Florida law, ballots mailed inside the United States must be in election offices by 7 p.m. on Election Day in order to count. Overseas ballots are counted if they are received up to 10 days after the election.\n\nMarc Elias, the attorney who represented Nelson, acknowledged on Twitter that \"the margin narrowed, but did not close\" as a result of the recount.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Nelson\u2019s plans will be post-race. The 76-year-old was first elected to office in a state House district near Cape Canaveral in 1972. He\u2019s served three terms in the Florida House, six terms in Congress and was Florida\u2019s insurance commissioner after Hurricane Andrew swept the Miami area.\n\nThe recount was marred by a series of missteps, particularly in Broward and Palm Beach counties, that put Florida back in the national spotlight 18 years after the dramatic 2000 presidential election.\n\nAfter getting off to a slow start, embattled Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes boasted Thursday about making the state\u2019s deadline for machine recounts.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be at this point,\u201d she said Thursday afternoon.\n\nA few hours later, election officials were forced to admit the county had uploaded the results of the recount two minutes after the state\u2019s 3 p.m. cutoff -- making its machine recount tally void.\n\n\u201cBasically, I just worked my ass off for nothing,\u201d Joseph D\u2019Alessandro, Broward County\u2019s election planning and development director, said.\n\nD\u2019Alessandro said he had a hard time uploading the results in time because he wasn\u2019t familiar with the website used to send them to the secretary of state.\n\nWhen asked what would happen if Broward missed Sunday\u2019s deadline, county attorney Drew Myers inhaled deeply and told Fox News he couldn\u2019t even entertain the idea.\n\n\u201cThey have to make that deadline,\u201d he said.\n\nBroward\u2019s bungled recount efforts had many calling for Snipes to step down, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes failed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians\u2019 confidence in our electoral process,\u201d Bush tweeted on Monday. \u201cSupervisor Snipes should be removed from her office following the recounts.\u201d\n\nProtesters have been camped outside Broward\u2019s Lauderhill recount site since last Sunday.\n\nSome carried signs that read, \u201cCorrupt Snipes!!! Lock Her Up!\u201d \u201cBusted Brenda\u201d and \u201cI trust [Michael] Avenatti more than Brenda!\u201d while shouting at election officials, counter-protesters and the news media.\n\nPresident Trump also sounded off on Snipes, telling The Daily Caller, \u201cWhen they call this woman incompetent, they\u2019re wrong. She\u2019s very competent but in a bad way.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Snipes said she\u2019s considering leaving after the recount.\n\n\u201cIt is time to move on,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t finalized that. I\u2019ll just check with my family. They\u2019ll tell me what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nLike Broward, Palm Beach County also missed its machine recount deadline.\n\nElection supervisor Susan Bucher said the county found \u201cdozens of precincts missing a significant number\u201d of votes and indicated there may be entire boxes of ballots that weren\u2019t counted, according to a report in the New York Times.\n\nShe also blamed the county\u2019s issues on mechanical errors and said the scanning machine overheated. It got so bad that she had to fly in two mechanics to fix the problem. The technicians, though, witnessed Palm Beach County workers jam a paper clip into the scanner\u2019s \u201center\u201d button to slow the high-speed scanner down. That action caused a short circuit that cut off the power.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Warner, who heard several legal challenges filed in connection to the recount, slammed state lawmakers and Palm Beach County officials for failing to anticipate election problems and said the state law on recounts appears to violate the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that decided the presidency in 2000.\n\n\u201cWe have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election, and we chose not to fix this,\u201d Walker said in court.\n\nWhile there have been no estimates yet on how much the 2018 recount will cost, past recounts have racked up a hefty bill.\n\nIn 2000, Citizens Against Government Waste released a report that estimated the costs associated with the state\u2019s recount efforts. CAGW estimated Palm Beach County blew through $25,000 a day and projected the 2000 recount cost in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties to be more than $2 million.\n\nFox News\u2019 Sarah Chakales, Ivonne Amor and Gregg Re contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Alexandra Deabler", "title": "Texas Roadhouse apologizes for asking breastfeeding mother to cover up - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Texas Roadhouse apologizes for asking breastfeeding mother to cover up Fox News A Texas Roadhouse restaurant in Louisville, Ky., has apologized to a mother who was asked by a manager to cover up while she was breastfeeding her seven-week-old daughter\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/texas-roadhouse-apologizes-for-asking-breastfeeding-mother-to-cover-up", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/iStock-513686282.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T16:23:50Z", "content": "A Texas Roadhouse restaurant in Louisville, Ky., has apologized to a mother who was asked by a manager to cover up while she was breastfeeding her seven-week-old daughter.

Basra province generates more than 90 percent of Iraq's oil exports but suffers from contaminated drinking water and regular blackouts.\n\nBasra police say al-Ghrawi was shot and killed in front of his house in the city center by unknown assailants late Saturday.\n\nHe was filmed at a protest on Friday saying clerics would issue a fatwa within days on taking up arms. The video was shared widely on Iraqi social media.\n\nAssociates and relatives of al-Ghrawi paraded his coffin around parts of the city on Sunday, demanding the police identify the killers and bring them to justice.\n\n\"Why was Sheikh Wissam al-Ghrawi killed? Because he asked for clean water? Because he asked for jobs for the unemployed? Is this the price he paid for defending his country?\" said civic activist Mohanad al-Ghrawi, a distant relative of the deceased cleric.\n\nAl-Ghrawi is at least the second activist to be killed in what appeared to be a targeted assassination since protests swept Basra last summer. One of the organizers, Soad al-Ali, was killed by a gunman in September, after protesters began directing their ire toward Iran, which they saw as exerting undue influence over national politics.\n\nDemonstrators set fire to the Iranian consulate and attacked the headquarters of the various Iran-backed militias and parties that operate with impunity in the city. Most of the city's official government buildings were torched, as well.\n\nPolice said al-Ali's killing was over a personal matter.\n\nSuspicions again turned toward the militias, collectively known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, on Sunday.\n\n\"We say here, once again, to the Basra security and police \u2014 have you done your job to stop these militias that kill the youth and intellectuals?\" said Mohanad al-Ghrawi.\n\nThe PMF were integral to Iraq's war against the Islamic State group earlier this decade and paid salaries to hundreds of thousands of fighters, many of whom were drawn from Iraq's impoverished southern provinces.\n\nBut with the war declared won late last year, attention has turned to Iraq's high unemployment and decaying infrastructure. Demonstrations erupted in the south last summer after regular blackouts appeared to grow worse and, in Basra, murky water began flowing out of taps. Health authorities said tens of thousands of residents were hospitalized in the summer months for stomach illnesses.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Philip Issa contributed from Baghdad."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Travis Fedschun", "title": "Baby mountain lion discovered at Colorado home was fed bratwurst, became sick, officials say", "description": "Sometimes it is just better to just let nature run its course, that's the message from officials in Colorado", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/baby-mountain-lion-discovered-at-colorado-home-was-fed-bratwurst-became-sick-officials-say", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/mountainlion2.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T14:09:35Z", "content": "Sometimes it's just better to just nature run its course.

In ruling that the administration temporarily has to restore Acosta's White House access pass on Fifth Amendment due process grounds, federal judge Timothy J. Kelly noted that Trump could simply choose to ignore the combative reporter. (Kelly, in his preliminary decision, did not rule on CNN's First Amendment claim.)\n\nBut Trump, speaking to Wallace, floated another idea for handling Acosta, who frequently spars with the president at length during press conferences.\n\n\"I think one of the things we\u2019ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don\u2019t have any air time, although I\u2019ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows,\" Trump mused. \"I mean, with this stuff you never know what\u2019s going to happen.\"\n\nCalling Acosta \"unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who\u2019s a wonderful woman,\" Trump said his administration is currently formulating \"rules and regulations\" for White House reporters. \"And if he misbehaves, we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference,\" the president added.\n\nTrump also defended Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker against Democrats' calls that he should recuse himself because he has written critically of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which he said in 2017 was at risk of becoming a \"political fishing expedition.\"\n\n\"I did not know that,\" Trump said, when asked if he was aware prior to appointing him that Whitaker had argued Mueller was coming close to exceeding his authority. \"I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.\"\n\nFOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: WHITAKER TELLS SEN. GRAHAM HE SEES NO NEED TO RECUSE HIMSELF\n\nTrump added that he \"would not get involved\" in Whitaker's decisions as he oversees Mueller's probe in his new role as head of the Justice Department. The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion affirming the constitutionality of Whitaker's temporary appointment without Senate approval.\n\n\"Look he -- it\u2019s going to be up to him,\" Trump said. \"I think he\u2019s very well aware politically. I think he\u2019s astute politically. He\u2019s a very smart person. A very respected person. He\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right. I really believe he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right.\"\n\nThe president added that he has personally responded to Mueller's written questions in the Russia probe and that they would be submitted \"very soon.\" Trump said his team is \"writing what I tell them to write\" in response to the inquiries.\n\nTrump emphasized, however, that he probably would not sit for an in-person interview with Mueller, amid fears voiced by his attorneys that the could be tricked into a so-called \"perjury trap\" in which, even if the president is honest, his version of events differs from other witness accounts enough to trigger a criminal prosecution.\n\n\"We\u2019ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is, probably, that we\u2019re finished,\" Trump said.\n\nHe continued: \"We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn\u2019t have even been asked, and I think that should solve the problem. I hope it solves the problem, if it doesn\u2019t, you know, I\u2019ll be told and we\u2019ll make a decision at that time. But probably this is the end.\"\n\nSEN. FLAKE VOWS TO BOYCOTT GOP JUDICIAL NOMINEES UNLESS MUELLER PROTECTION LEGISLATION GETS A VOTE -- BUT GOP RAISES CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES\n\nTurning to another one of his frequent critics -- former President Barack Obama -- Trump took something of a victory lap, following news that some of the top candidates Obama had backed in the midterm elections had come up short.\n\n\"I won against President Obama and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama in a great state called Georgia for the governor,\" Trump said, referring to defeated Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams' top surrogates. \"And it was all stacked against Brian [Kemp], and I was the one that went for Brian, and Brian won.\" (Abrams acknowledged in a fiery speech this week that she would not win the race, but strongly suggested Republican Brian Kemp had prevailed because of voter suppression, and vowed a lawsuit.)\n\n\"Look at Florida,\" Trump continued. \"I went down to Florida. [GOP Senate candidate] Rick Scott won, and he won by a lot. I don\u2019t know what happened to all those votes that disappeared at the very end. And if I didn\u2019t put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would have lost that election, OK? In my opinion he would have lost. They would have taken that election away from him. Rick Scott won Florida.\"\n\nThe results of a manual recount in the Florida Senate were reported on Sunday, and Scott prevailed over Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, following a series of lawsuits and snafus that exposed long-running issues with ballot counting in the state. In the gubernatorial race, Democrat Andrew Gillum conceded this weekend in his close fight with Republican Ron DeSantis.\n\nFLORIDA ELECTION BOSS SAYS RACISM MAY BE REASON SHE'S CRITICIZED FOR INCOMPETENCE, POTENTIAL FRAUD\n\nBut Trump also revealed that Obama, who also campaigned against Trump in several other states, had offered him some important guidance in the White House shortly after his 2016 election.\n\n\"I think North Korea\u2019s been very tough because you know we were very close. When I took that over -- President Obama right in those two chairs, we sat and talked and he said that\u2019s by far the biggest problem that this country has,\" Trump told Wallace. \"And I think we had real decision as to which way to go on North Korea and certainly at least so far I\u2019m very happy with the way we went.\"\n\nAddressing national security matters, Trump told Wallace that he has been briefed on the audio recording of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's apparent murder in Turkey, but said he hasn't listened to it, calling it a \"suffering tape\" that he was advised not to hear.\n\n\"You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia,\" Trump said. \"But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\" He also said it \"takes two to tango\" to resolve the conflict in Yemen, where Iranian-backed insurgents are facing off in a proxy war against Saudi-backed forces, noting that \"I want Saudi to stop, but I want Iran to stop also.\"\n\nTrump went on to defend his administration's decision to pull hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Pakistan, saying the country doesn't do \"a damn thing for us\" and charging that its government helped terror leader Osama bin Laden hide there.\n\n\"They don\u2019t do a damn thing for us.\" \u2014 President Trump on Pakistan\n\n\"You know, living \u2013 think of this \u2013 living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan in what I guess they considered a nice mansion, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve seen nicer,\" Trump said, referring to bin Laden and his former compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The compound was demolished shortly after United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group forces, in a daring late-night helicopter raid, killed bin Laden there in 2011.\n\n\"But living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there,\" he added. \"And we give Pakistan $1.3 billion a year . ... [bin Laden] lived in Pakistan, we\u2019re supporting Pakistan, we\u2019re giving them $1.3 billion a year -- which we don\u2019t give them anymore, by the way. I ended it because they don\u2019t do anything for us, they don\u2019t do a damn thing for us.\"\n\nTrump also characterized Adm. William H. McRaven, who oversaw the operation to kill bin Laden, as a \"Hillary Clinton fan\" when Wallace mentioned that he has criticized Trump's harsh rhetoric on the media as a major threat to democracy. McRaven was on Clinton's shortlist for vice president in 2016 and has praised her publicly.\n\n\"Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice?\u201d Trump asked Wallace, seemingly attacking either McRaven or Pakistani officials.\n\nAnd Trump sounded a note of regret for not visiting Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C., on Veterans Day -- which Obama did several times when he was in office.\n\n\"I should have done that,\" Trump said. \"I was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling, as you know. ... I probably, you know, in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American cemetery in Paris and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state doing other things.\"\n\n'EMERGENCY' LEFT-WING NYC PROTEST AGAINST SESSIONS FIRING HEADS THROUGH UNION SQUARE -- HIGH ON ENERGY, IRONY\n\nTrump, who spent nearly an hour Thursday at the Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. -- where tables were lined with miniature pumpkin pies ahead of Thanksgiving -- said he has some plans to potentially visit U.S. troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan for the first time.\n\n\"Well, I think you will see that happen,\" the president said, after Wallace noted that Obama and former President George W. Bush had each visited soldiers in war zones. \"There are things that are being planned. We don\u2019t want to talk about it because of -- obviously because of security reasons and everything else.\"\n\nExplaining why he canceled a trip to visit a World War I memorial ceremony in Paris, Trump cited the weather and sharply criticized the media for making a \"big deal\" out of the situation. The president noted he attended an event the next day in the rain at a cemetery just outside Paris on Armistice Day.\n\n\"They said, 'Sir,' the Secret Service said, 'Sir, you cannot go. We are not prepared. You cannot go,'\" Trump said. \"Because it was supposed to be helicopter, but the helicopter couldn\u2019t fly because of zero visibility.\"\n\nCalling media reports that he is bitter and resentful following the midterm elections nothing more than \"disgusting fake news,\" Trump next addressed some potential high-level departures from his administration.\n\nOn Department of Homeland Security head Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump suggested he wants to see an improvement on border security. The first members of a large Central American migrant caravan arrived in the Mexican city of Tijuana last week and were photographed attempting to climb a border fence there.\n\n\"Well, I like her a lot. I respect her a lot,\" Trump said, referring to Nielsen. \"She\u2019s very smart. I want her to get much tougher and we\u2019ll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough. ... I like her very much, I respect her very much, I\u2019d like her to be much tougher on the border -- much tougher, period.\"\n\nHe added there's a \"chance\" that Nielsen, who was accosted in a restaurant this summer by far-left progressive activists as her security detail kept close watch, will continue in her role.\n\nTrump definitively told Wallace that Chief of Staff John Kelly will \"move on\" at some point, even as he claimed there was still some chance Kelly will stay with the administration through 2020.\n\n\"There are certain things I love what he does,\" the president said. \"And there are certain things that I don\u2019t like that he does -- that aren\u2019t his strength. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t do -- you know he works so hard. He\u2019s doing an excellent job in many ways. There are a couple of things where it\u2019s just not his strength. It\u2019s not his fault, it\u2019s not his strength. ... But John, at some point, is going to want to move on. John will move on.\"\n\nMultiple reports have suggested that Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers, will replace Kelly.\n\nAnd on Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel, whom the White House announced would depart her role this week, Trump offered a blunt assessment.\n\n\"I met with Mira two days ago, and we\u2019re going to move her around,\" Trump said. \"She was with me for a long time, although I don\u2019t know her. She\u2019s really somebody I don\u2019t know very well. But we\u2019re going to move her around because she\u2019s got certain talents. But, frankly, she is not -- she\u2019ll never be put in the United Nations, let me put it that way. ... She\u2019s not too diplomatic, but she\u2019s talented.\"\n\nTaking stock of the administration's progress after two years, amid some past and apparently pending roster changes, Trump gave himself high marks -- literally.\n\n\"I think I\u2019m doing a great job. We have the best economy we\u2019ve ever had,\" the president said. \"We\u2019re doing really well. We would have been at war with North Korea if, let\u2019s say, that administration continued forward.\"\n\nTrump continued: \"I would give myself, I would \u2013 look, I hate to do it, but I will do it, I would give myself an A+, is that enough? Can I go higher than that?\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Katherine Lam", "title": "Man dies after being stung by stingray at Australian beach - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Man dies after being stung by stingray at Australian beach Fox News A 42-year-old Australian man died Saturday after a suspected stingray attack while he was swimming at a beach, police said.

The rules also allow prosecuting those most responsible for carrying out atrocities.\n\nSar Kheng's remarks were reported Sunday.\n\nOn Friday, the tribunal sentenced Nuon Chea, 92, the main Khmer Rouge ideologist and right-hand man to its late leader Pol Pot, and Khieu Samphan, 87, who served as its head of state, to life sentences. The two had already been serving life sentences on a previous conviction.\n\nIn nine years of hearings and at a cost of more than $300 million, the tribunal has convicted only one other defendant, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nCases of four more suspects, middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, had already been processed for prosecution but have been scuttled or stalled. Without the cooperation of the Cambodian members of the tribunal, no cases can go forward.\n\nLong-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen has repeatedly declared there would be no more prosecutions, claiming they could cause unrest.

He helped cement his political control by making alliances with other former Khmer Rouge commanders.\n\nIn his remarks, Sar Kheng, sought to reassure former Khmer Rouge members that they would not face prosecution.\n\n\"Because there are some former Khmer Rouge officers living in this area, I would like to clarify that there will be no more investigations taking place (against lower-ranking Khmer Rouge members), so you don't have to worry,\" said Sar Kheng, who is also interior minister.\n\nHe acknowledged that even without more prosecutions, the tribunal still had to hear the appeals expected to be lodged by Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, but aside from that task, its work was finished."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Walt Bonner", "title": "Fire ant colonies could inspire robot swarms", "description": "Aside from the stings and ruined picnics, fire ants are famous for their ability to swarm together and self\u00ad\u2013assemble bridges, ladders, and even floating rafts.

Researchers have now figured out the statistical rules that govern how fire ants form these structures, and the new study could help scientists build swarming, tiny shape-shifting robots.\n\nA team from the University of Colorado at Boulder wanted to learn how the self\u2013made rafts, bridges, and ladders\u2013 which can take hundreds to thousands of fire ants to form\u2013 can change shape in a matter of seconds and maintain a rubber-like flexibility.\n\n\u201cFire ants are a great subject of study because they display collective intelligence and they\u2019re also macroscopic, which makes them relatively easy to observe and study,\u201d lead study author Franck Vernerey told Fox News. \u201cRecent studies have measured how fire ant [clusters] flow under stress and have opened a window into understanding these communication rules. In this paper, we proposed a statistical theory that links these rules between individuals to their collective behavior and thus paves the way to understanding the origin of swarm \u2018intelligence\u2019.\u201d\n\nFLORENCE FLOODWATERS RESULT IN 'ISLANDS' OF FLOATING FIRE ANTS\n\nVernerey and his team used another Georgia Tech University study as a starting point. That study showed that ant colonies keep flexible by constantly being on their toes (or in this case, the sticky pads on their feet). By hanging onto the ants next to them, they shift on their feet, latching onto a different neighbor every .7 seconds.\n\nBuilding from that data, the researchers used mathematical equations to break down the inner dynamics of the ants\u2019 movements. They found that as the force on the ant increases, it moves faster. And when the force on an ant\u2019s leg has to support more than eight times its body weight, the insect shifts its foot position to lessen the load, moving between its fellow ants at a faster rate.\n\n\u201cOur hypothesis was that the rate at which individual ants break their connections with neighbors increased with the force that they feel due to deformation of the [formation],\u201d Vernerey explained. \u201cIt correctly predicted the three phases observed experimentally: when deformed slowly, the ants have ample time to reconfigure themselves by breaking and reforming connections, thereby flowing like a typical fluid. When deformed faster, the ants sense the increased force in their legs and respond by detaching their legs faster from their neighbors resulting in much easier flow.\u201d\n\nISLAND OF FIRE ANTS SPOTTED ON HOUSTON FLOODWATERS\n\nThe last phase, when the forces increase with so much speed that the ants can\u2019t keep up and they no longer have time to detach from their neighbors is when the whole formation bends like solid rubber to resist from falling apart.\n\nVernerey believes the new statistical theory paves the way to understanding the origin of swarm intelligence. It also could lead to a new wave of bio-inspired robots. \u201cAs engineers, one main motivation for studying these insects is that we could potentially harness these simple rules to propose bio-inspired, synthetic materials that could be just as smart,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor instance, we found that fire ants can form clusters that flow like a fluid or stiffen up like a solid at will. Harnessing that kind of ability in our own materials would put us one step closer towards having \u2018programmable matter\u2019 with extraordinary functions.\u201d\n\nNORTH CAROLINA WOMAN SAYS FIRE ANTS 'EXPLODED' ALL OVER, DELIVERING PAINFUL STINGS THAT NEARLY KILLED HER\n\nThe new materials could be developed for robots that might be able to slim down and access tight spaces.\n\n\u201cThey could reconfigure themselves to perform complex tasks like recovering important pieces of information in reconnaissance missions, providing temporary structural supports like scaffolds or simply mimicking the shapes of other objects at the user\u2019s will\u2013 knives or screw-drivers, for example,\u201d Vernerey proposed. \u201cThe thing is, it\u2019s actually quite difficult and involved to design this kind of smart, modular matter at the length scale of ants or smaller. By learning from fire ants and other social insects, we can identify a set of very basic rules that engineers can use as a roadmap for designing such materials in the future.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "The Kim Komando Show", "title": "Best streaming boxes for getting the shows and movies you want", "description": "Limitless content.

After decades of flipping through TV channels, many of us find the promise of internet-based television too miraculous to pass up.\n\nThat's why millions of Americans prefer streaming services \u2013 the leaner, cheaper version of televised entertainment.\n\nMuch of the streaming decision is dependent on what you want to watch. You\u2019re not going to find \u201cThe Handmaiden\u2019s Tale\u201d on Netflix or FoxNews on Dish\u2019s Sling TV. It gets confusing.\n\nTo help you out, I created something that I call, \u201cThe Streaming Service Channel Lineup Chart.\u201d The whole idea is to let you find what you want to watch and then, match it to the service that offers it. Tap or click here to see the chart.\n\nNo streaming device is \u201cbest,\u201d of course, because all the leading brands have their advantages (and disadvantages). Here are some facet options and a comprehensive breakdown for each one.\n\nApple TV 4K\n\nPros: Compared to its competitors, the Apple TV 4K currently has the best hardware available in a streaming box, designed to effortlessly handle 60 fps 4K, Dolby Atmos and HDR content.\n\nIt also has the cleanest and smoothest interface among the lot, delivering a minimal but polished experience all around.\n\nSince it's an Apple product, it also works great with iPhones, iPads, and Macs, and it's compatible with Airplay content streaming, Apple Music and other HomeKit appliances.\n\nIf you're already knee-deep in the Apple ecosystem, the Apple TV is a no-brainer. The 4K resolution will ensure its longevity, whether you have a 4K TV yet or not.\n\nApp-wise, aside from your purchased iTunes movies and music, it has all the essentials like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, Hulu, Plex, HBO, DirecTV Now, AT&T Watch TV, Sling TV, plus if you own digital movies across multiple services, they can all be synced via Movies Anywhere.\n\nCons: As you would have guessed, the Apple TV is relatively expensive. For much less, you can likewise stream 4K content from Roku and Amazon Fire TV boxes. The included Siri touch\n\nremote can also be clunky and unwieldy. Additionally, if you're not into the Apple ecosystem and you don't own any other Apple gadgets, you won't be getting the most out of an Apple TV.\n\nPrice: $179 for 32GB, $199 for 64GB\n\nRoku Ultra\n\nPros: Even with increased competition from the tech giants, Roku remains to be the most popular brand in streaming players. Why? It's a service-agnostic platform, meaning it has apps from almost every content provider out there (except Apple and iTunes).\n\nRoku has apps for Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies, Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, Hulu, Plex, HBO, DirecTV Now, and Sling TV (sadly, no AT&T Watch TV app yet).\n\nPlus, it has hundreds of third-party video apps that offer free movies and TV Shows. If you want to access the most content from various services available, then the Roku is the one for you.\n\nFor the nitty-gritty specs, the Roku Ultra supports 4K, HDR, Dolby Atmos and it's even bundled with a pair of JBL earphones you can connect to its remote for wireless audio.\n\nCons: The interface can be slow, including the Roku Ultra, and the design is less attractive. Roku is clamping down on third-party apps. Since they update apps automatically, some of your installed apps can be deactivated without prior warning.\n\nPrice: $99\n\nAmazon Fire TV Cube\n\nPros: If you\u2019re building a smart home, and you\u2019re attracted to voice-controlled electronics, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the Fire TV Cube has built-in Alexa functions. This means you can dim your smart bulbs, control your smart appliances, ask questions, set timers \u2013 pretty much anything a regular Amazon Echo can do.\n\nYou can also use your voice to search, play, pause, fast-forward and handle all the things you would typically do with a remote.\n\nYou can even turn an HDMI-CEC compatible TV on or off and adjust its volume. But don't worry if you have an older TV; the Fire TV Cube also has a built-in IR transmitter so you can use it as a universal remote and voice control any TV, old and new.\n\nAs a bonus, since it\u2019s connected to a display, it can also duplicate the features of Amazon's Echo Show, the video-based version of Echo. With an Alexa voice command, the Cube can provide you with detailed weather forecasts, display lyrics to songs and show you live video feeds from Alexa-compatible security cameras.\n\nAs expected, Amazon content is front and center on all Fire TVs, but it also has the must-have apps like Netflix, Vudu, Hulu, Plex, HBO, DirecTV Now, AT&T Watch TV, and Sling TV.\n\nFor video, the Fire TV Cube has support for 4K content, HDR, Dolby Atmos. Again, even if you don't have a 4K TV yet if you're in the market for a streaming gadget, a 4K capable streaming box is worth it.\n\nCons: Like its apps, Amazon's Fire TV interface is cluttered with promoted content and is a pain to navigate through. Alexa Fire TV integration is often frustrating, and voice controlling a TV through the Fire TV Cube can be painfully slow.\n\nPrice: $119\n\nChromecast Ultra\n\nPros: If you've ever owned a Chromecast, you'll know that they can be extra useful around the house. With this unobtrusive little gadget, you can cast or stream content from your iOS or Android smartphone or Chrome browser to your TV. You can even cast your whole desktop if you want to.\n\nUltra is not a traditional streaming box like the others, because the device doesn't come with its own remote. Instead, your smartphone behaves like a remote for your Chromecast set up, and you can stream content from compatible apps like Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, Sling TV, Plex, and Vudu straight to your TV.\n\nBetter yet, you can also integrate Chromecasts with the Google Home and with HDMI-CEC compatible TVs, you can have good (but limited) hands-free voice control. At about $70, Chromecast Ultra is one of the cheapest streaming gadgets to cast both 4K and HDR content.\n\nCons: Again, no actual physical remote. You will always depend on your smartphone or tablet to operate it. Amazon Prime Video and iTunes are also unavailable, which will deprive you of a lot of content.\n\nPrice: $69\n\nBy the way, if you\u2019re looking for a step-by-step guide for how to cut the cord, tap or click here to download my ebook about it.\n\nWhat digital lifestyle questions do you have?

He said he would try to convince Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and his centrist Kulanu party to stay in the fold.\n\n\"It would be both unnecessary and incorrect to go to elections. We remember well what happened when elements inside the coalitions took down Likud governments in 1992 and in 1999,\" he said, noting the past two elections in which the Labor Party came to power.\n\n\"We need to do everything we can to prevent repeating these mistakes,\" he added.\n\nThe sudden coalition crisis was sparked by the resignation of Israel's hard-line Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who had demanded a far stronger response last week to the most massive wave of rocket attacks on Israel since the 2014 Israel-Hamas war. He alleges the truce will put southern Israel under a growing threat from Hamas, similar to that posed to northern Israel by Lebanon's heavily armed Hezbollah group.\n\nThe departure of Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu party leaves the coalition with a one-seat majority in the 120-member parliament. Netanyahu's other partners say that makes governing untenable and would leave the coalition susceptible to the extortion of any single lawmaker until elections scheduled for November 2019.\n\nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett, of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, has already threatened to bring down the government if he is not appointed defense minister. Kahlon says another year of such instability will harm the economy.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to convince them to stay, and his Likud allies are already preparing to pin the blame on them if that effort fails.\n\n\"I think that there is no reason to shorten the term of a national government, not even for one day, and at this moment it's in the hands of the education minister and the finance minister,\" said Gilad Erdan, the minister of public security.\n\nNo Israeli government has served out its full term since 1988. Since then, elections have almost always been moved up because of a coalition crisis or a strategic move by the prime minister to maximize his chances of re-election.\n\nThough Netanyahu has been reportedly flirting with the idea of moving up elections himself in recent months, the current timing is not ideal for him.\n\nHe has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the Gaza cease-fire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class, rocket-battered towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his Likud Party. But with Lieberman forcing his hand and the other coalition partners appearing eager to head to the polls he may not have a choice.\n\nMost opinion polls show Netanyahu easily securing re-election, which would secure him a place in Israeli history as the country's longest serving leader. But several factors could trip him up, including a potential corruption indictment that could knock him out of contention.\n\nPolice have recommended he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases and have questioned him at length on another. The country has long been eagerly awaiting the attorney general's decision on whether to press charges.\n\nNetanyahu has angrily dismissed the accusations against him, characterizing them as part of a media-driven witch-hunt that is obsessed with removing him from office."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Interpol meets to select new president after China's arrest", "description": "Police chiefs from around the world gathered in Dubai on Sunday for Interpol's general assembly to select a new president after the agency's former leader was detained in China.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/interpol-meets-to-select-new-president-after-chinas-arrest", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-7c08ff466a30492889b8a8c348082c78.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T09:48:24Z", "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates Police chiefs from around the world gathered in Dubai on Sunday for Interpol's general assembly to select a new president after the agency's former leader was detained in China.

It later emerged that the long-time Communist Party insider with decades of experience in China's security apparatus was detained as part of a sweeping purge against allegedly corrupt or disloyal officials under President Xi Jinping's authoritarian administration.\n\nInterpol member-states will also be deciding whether to accept Kosovo as a full member, which would allow officials there to file red notices for Serbian officials that Kosovo considers war criminals.\n\nThe red notices are alerts circulated by Interpol to all member countries that identify a person wanted for arrest by another country. Interpol says there are 57,289 active red notices around the world.\n\nInterpol acts as a clearinghouse for national police services that want to hunt down suspects outside their borders. The body, however, has faced criticism that governments have abused the \"red notice\" system to go after political enemies and dissidents, even though its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality and prohibits the use of police notices for political reasons.\n\nTwo years ago, Interpol introduced new measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice's compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out. Interpol also introduced an appeals body for those targeted with red notices.\n\nChinese authorities say Meng is being lawfully investigated for taking bribes and other crimes. China's beleaguered rights activists point out that as someone with a seat atop the country's powerful public security apparatus, Meng helped build the opaque system of largely unchecked power wielded by the ruling Communist Party to which he's now fallen victim.\n\nMeng's wife has told The Associated Press from France that the bribery accusation he faces is just an excuse for a lengthy detention and that he is being persecuted for political reasons.\n\nAs more than 1,000 delegates from 192 member-states began filling the main hall for the annual event, Interpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock explained to reporters that the agency's rules did not allow for Meng to continue acting as president. Meng had been serving as president since November 2016, and his term was due to end in 2020.\n\nHe said Interpol received Meng's resignation letter from China on Oct. 7 and that Interpol was notified by Chinese authorities that Meng is no longer a delegate to Interpol.\n\n\"It sounds a little technical but again that automatically leads to the fact, according to our rules, that he is not the president anymore,\" Stock said. \"We had to take the measures to ensure the functioning of the organization.\"\n\nMeng's representatives say Interpol accepted an unsigned resignation letter without any resistance and without evidence of his consent.\n\nIn Meng's place on Sunday, senior vice president of Interpol's executive committee, Kim Jong Yang of South Korea\u2014 who was previously named acting president \u2014 helped open the ceremony for the general assembly meeting.\n\nA little more than a week ago, Stock told reporters in France\u2014 where Interpol is headquartered\u2014 that there was no reason for him to suspect that anything about Meng's resignation \"was forced or wrong.\"\n\nHe said he \"encouraged\" Chinese authorities to provide information about Meng's location and legal status but can do no more because the role of Interpol is \"not to govern over member states.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Taliban hold talks with US envoy in Qatar", "description": "The Taliban have held three days of talks with U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in the Gulf state of Qatar, where the Afghan insurgent group has a political office, a Taliban official and another individual close to the group said Sunday.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/taliban-hold-talks-with-us-envoy-in-qatar", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/78e32243-ContentBroker_contentid-772b228ff1cf4077827ac203648a82fb.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T09:27:22Z", "content": "ISLAMABAD The Taliban have held three days of talks with U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in the Gulf state of Qatar, where the Afghan insurgent group has a political office, a Taliban official and another individual close to the group said Sunday.

Seventeen years after the U.S.-led invasion that ended Taliban rule, the militants control nearly half of Afghanistan and carry out near-daily attacks on local security forces and government officials.\n\nThe two individuals said Khairullah Khairkhwa, the former Taliban governor of Herat, and Mohammed Fazl, a former Taliban military chief, attended the marathon talks. The two individuals spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive negotiations.\n\nU.S. officials could not immediately be reached for comment. The State Department has refused to comment on reported talks with the Taliban.\n\nA third individual with knowledge of the discussions said the Taliban pressed for a postponement of next year's presidential elections and the establishment of an interim government under a neutral leadership. Abdul Sattar Sirat, an ethnic Tajik and Islamic scholar, was suggested as a candidate to lead an interim administration.\n\nThe individual, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, said Khalilzad wants to reach a settlement within six months, a timescale the Taliban said was too short. Khalilzad also proposed a cease-fire, which the Taliban rejected, the individual said, adding that there was no agreement on the release of prisoners, opening the Taliban office or lifting a Taliban travel ban.\n\nKhairkhwa and Fazel were among five senior Taliban members released from the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2014 in exchange for U.S. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was captured by the Taliban after walking off his base in Afghanistan in 2009. The five are now based in Qatar, and are seen as having enough stature to sell a peace deal to insurgents fighting on the front lines.\n\nPresident Donald Trump harshly criticized the 2014 prisoner exchange, and in a speech last August pledged to send in additional U.S. forces and redouble efforts to defeat the Taliban. But that strategy has had little if any impact on the ground, with the Taliban keeping up a steady tempo of attacks and an Islamic State affiliate carrying out massive bombings targeting minority Shiites.\n\nThe Trump administration now appears focused on reaching a political settlement with the Taliban, and has given in to a number of the group's longstanding demands, beginning with the holding of direct talks. The Taliban have long refused U.S. demands to negotiate with the Western-backed government in Kabul, which the insurgents view as a puppet regime.\n\nPakistan has meanwhile released a number of high-level Taliban prisoners, including the movement's co-founder, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. The releases are widely seen as a U.S.-directed move aimed at encouraging the Taliban to participate in talks.\n\nIn a lengthy statement issued earlier this month, the Taliban had demanded the lifting of sanctions against the group's leaders, the release of prisoners and the recognition of their office in Qatar. The Afghan government is deeply opposed to any recognition of the Qatar office, which the Taliban in the past have billed as a government in exile.\n\nKhalilzad has been touring the region in recent days, and reportedly met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Sunday. He is expected to press Ghani to cobble together his own negotiating team, which could prove difficult given the deep divisions within the government."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Fox News", "title": "Notre Dame wins big, looks ahead to possible playoff spot", "description": "After a big win Saturday in the Big Apple, Notre Dame's football team has a chance next week to lock up a berth in the College Football Playoff.

Maybe somebody recently wronged you. An unexpected expense has thrown off your budget. That new role at your job isn\u2019t as shiny as you thought it would be. Or maybe you\u2019ve been trying to do the right things, live the right way, but situations STILL aren\u2019t working out in your favor.\n\nHow do you cope? How do you resist the urge to give up? How do you continue to do good even when you\u2019re not seeing any immediate benefits from \u201cliving the right way?\" And HOW IN THE WORLD can you be thankful for all of this?\n\nI think Christians sometimes get into a bad habit of making overarching statements about this topic \u2013 saying things like, \u201cGod is in control,\u201d and \u201cGod won\u2019t give you more than you can handle.\u201d While there is truth in these statements, we have to understand them in the right context.\n\nAs sinners, there are things we do or that happen to us that God might not have intended for us. Sometimes, because He has given us free will, we make the wrong decisions and find ourselves in troubling situations. This is NOT to say that every bad thing that happens to us is because of something we\u2019ve done.\n\nThe point is, life is too complex for us to fully understand. From our viewpoint, we can only see the present struggles we\u2019re experiencing, but God can see the full picture. And He can use these situations for our benefit in ways we can\u2019t begin to comprehend.\n\nSociety tells us that when times are tough, we should grin and bear it. On the surface, that sounds like a noble goal. But if you look closely at scripture, God tells us something different. He instructs us to \u201cBe thankful in all circumstances, for this is God\u2019s will for you who belong to Christ Jesus\u201d (1 Thess. 5:18). Yes \u2013 seriously \u2013 we should be THANKFUL even when things don\u2019t go our way.\n\nI already know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cUgh please \u2013 this girl\u2019s delusional. She\u2019s young and na\u00efve and reading the Bible way too literally.\u201d I get it. This passage confused me when I first read it and at times I still struggle with the concept of gratitude in the face of adversity.\n\nOf course my life struggles don\u2019t compare to those that others have experienced. I\u2019m young and still have a long road ahead of me. But I\u2019m not too young to trust God\u2019s Word and his promises. God has helped shift my perspective on His command to rejoice in times of troubles. There\u2019s a second layer to this that might also help you to better understand.\n\nHe says, \u201cWe can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love\u201d (Romans 5:3-5).\n\nIt\u2019s a commonly held belief that \u201cwhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.\u201d We get behind this idea when we hear it in pop-culture, singing it in songs and slapping it on bumper stickers, but when God\u2019s attached to this idea, we often get angry and start asking things like, \u201cHow can a loving God let us suffer so much?\u201d\n\nBad things do happen, but Christians shouldn\u2019t be naive. We must remember that we live in a fallen world where things won\u2019t be fair or easy. BUT, God\u2019s strength is made perfect in our weakness if we stay connected to Him against our natural instincts.\n\nWe can learn to be grateful in times of trouble when we remember that God loves us too much to want us stay in our comfort zones. Our comfort zones may feel nice and cozy, but they leave little room for growth and definitely NO room for miracles.\n\nWe have to trust God as He takes us outside of our comfort zones, remembering, \u201cthat in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to this purpose\u201d (Romans 8:28).\n\nIf suffering brings us closer to the perfect joy that only Jesus can give us, we can begin to understand how we can be thankful through the tough times. Talk to God and ask Him to help you adjust your perspective. He is ready to comfort you through your pain.\n\nSo no matter what hardships you might be facing this holiday season, keep in mind that God loves you and does want the absolute best for you, which is to be closer to Him. We can all be thankful for that."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Fox News", "title": "Powerball numbers drawn for Saturday's $124M jackpot - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Powerball numbers drawn for Saturday's $124M jackpot Fox News The Powerball jackpot was on the rise again late Saturday after no winners were reported in the evening's drawing.

Saudi Arabia's top diplomat has said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had \"absolutely\" nothing to do with it.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies have concluded that the crown prince ordered the killing in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey, according to a U.S. official familiar with the assessment. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Others familiar with the case caution that while it's likely that the crown prince was involved in the death, there continue to be questions about what role he played.\n\n\"The United States government is determined to hold all those responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable,\" the State Department said in a statement. \"Recent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate. There remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"The U.S. government has taken decisive measures against the individuals responsible, including visa and sanctions actions. We will continue to explore additional measures to hold those accountable who planned, led and were connected to the murder. And, we will do that while maintaining the important strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nIntelligence officials have been providing information to Trump about the death for weeks and he was briefed again by phone Saturday by CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as he flew to California. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders provided no details of his call but said the president has confidence in the CIA.\n\nBefore his call on Air Force One, Trump told reporters that when it came to the crown prince, \"as of this moment we were told that he did not play a role. We're going to have to find out what they have to say.\" That echoed remarks by national security adviser John Bolton, who said earlier this week that people who have listened to an audio recording of the killing do not think it implicates the crown prince.\n\nAlso before leaving on his trip, Trump said Saudi Arabia was \"a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development.\"\n\n\"I have to take a lot of things into consideration\" when deciding what measures to take against the kingdom, he said.\n\nTrump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \"the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\"\n\nBut he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda.\n\nBut members of Congress are pushing Trump for a tougher response to the killing. The administration this past week penalized 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing, but American lawmakers have called on the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other harsher punitive measures.\n\nVice President Mike Pence told reporters traveling with him Saturday for a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Papua, New Guinea, that the \"murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity. It was also an affront to a free and independent press, and the United States is determined to hold all of those accountable who are responsible for that murder.\"\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States, often criticized the royal family.

More than two millennia later, an alarm system warns visitors if flood water rushes toward what has become Jordan's main tourist attraction.\n\nEarlier this month, the alarms were activated for the first time, said Hussein al-Hasanat of the Petra Development & Tourism Region Authority. Sirens blared minutes before a torrent fed by heavy rains approached the UNESCO World Heritage site carved into rose-hued rock face.\n\nHundreds of tourists were able to seek higher ground and were later evacuated, he said.\n\nAmateur video posted online at the time showed visitors running through a steep, narrow canyon leading to the Treasury, Petra's main draw, as guides urged them to hurry. Later, visitors were seen standing on a higher patch near the Treasury as knee-high water poured through the canyon.\n\nElsewhere in Jordan, such alarms are still missing. Thirty-four people were killed in flash floods in late September and early November.\n\nThe last fatal flash flood struck Petra in 1963 when 22 French tourists and a local guide were killed by rapidly rising waters. In response, Jordan's Department of Antiquities built a dam to keep water from entering the canyon leading to the Treasury.\n\nIn 2014, the alarm system was installed as added protection, with sirens set to go off when flood water rises above a certain level.\n\nOn Nov. 9, the system was triggered for the first time, through a computer in the Petra Authority's control room. The computer is connected to eight rain forecast systems and two water detection stations placed in the area, within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of Petra.\n\nThe network generates instant data allowing officials to measure possible danger and warn people by the time the water reaches Petra.\n\nOmar Dajani, a meteorologist at the Arabia Weather company, said alarms should be installed in all vulnerable areas in Jordan.\n\nHe said urban sprawl has exacerbated the flood risk, which is particularly high in dry areas.\n\n\"Now towns have spread so much and many of them were not built with respect for the geography of the region, such as valleys for example, where the water has naturally caused floods for millions of years,\" Dajani said."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "| Fox News", "title": "GOP lame ducks in House need to move fast before their wings are clipped", "description": "Congressional Republicans need to pass bills quickly before Democrats gain majority control of the House.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gop-lame-ducks-in-house-need-to-move-fast-before-their-wings-are-clipped", "urlToImage": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/13/694940094001_5966454653001_5966453676001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T06:18:45Z", "content": "In Washington, power is fleeting.

Elected and appointed officials know they better use it before they lose it.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Republicans are going to lose it Jan. 3 when they become the minority party. The change in power that GOP representatives will experience will be dramatic \u2013 like Superman turning into Clark Kent or Wonder Woman turning into Diana Prince.\n\nVoters elected a Democratic majority to the House in the Nov. 6 midterm elections, ending uninterrupted Republican control of the chamber that last began in 2011. With a few races still undecided, Democrats have flipped at least 35 seats held by Republicans. This gives the Democrats the ability to elect a new speaker of the House and install Democratic chairs to head every committee.\n\nWhile the Senate will remain under Republican control in January, legislation needs to be approved in both the Senate and House to become law. So Republicans have only a short time left to pass bills during their lame duck session and get them to President Trump so he can sign them.\n\nThis task is more complicated than it sounds, because Republicans have plenty of disagreements with each other. But they would be foolish to let their differences prevent them from making progress on important measures in the next few weeks.\n\nRepublicans need to play chess and not Russian roulette with the Democrats. There is an opportunity to horse trade or to jam Democrats if Republicans adopt the ancient advice that \u201cunited we stand, divided we fall\u201d and think strategically.\n\nI urge Republicans to work long days and into the night for the remainder of this year to pass as many measures as they can, not kicking the can down the road to the next Congress where Democrats will be empowered.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may need Republican votes to be elected speaker of the House, because some Democratic insurgents are saying they won\u2019t support her bid.\n\nThe Democratic rebels are giving Republicans leverage over Pelosi to demand that she agree to some GOP priorities \u2013 like funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as other spending measures \u2013 in return for their support.\n\nThe idea is that it is better to deal with the devil you know than what could come next.\n\nI urge Republicans to work long days and into the night for the remainder of this year to pass as many measures as they can, not kicking the can down the road to the next Congress where Democrats will be empowered.\n\nRepublicans should be able to get bipartisan support for measures like a budget resolution needed to avoid a government shutdown, permanent repeal of the medical device tax, and a multibillion-dollar program to fund infrastructure expansion and improvement projects.\n\nThen there are heavier lifts like immigration reform, border wall funding, tax cut 2.0 to target the middle class, and the Holy Grail \u2013 a full and complete repeal and replacement of ObamaCare.\n\nRepublicans should not squander the opportunity to lead \u2013 the sand is almost through the hourglass. For many representatives who lost their seats in the midterm elections, action and results could be a great legacy as they exit stage right.\n\nRepublicans should have no regrets as this year ends and not give up the fight in 2019. Democrats cannot govern alone next year.\n\nIf Democrats act in good faith and heed the electorate that is sick and tired of bitter partisanship they will get things done. Democrats would be wise to resist the temptation to get even for past grievances and the urge to engage in endless, pointless and fruitless investigations.\n\nWhat Democrats need to realize and accept is that President Trump is transactional \u2013 not an entrenched ideologue. He wants to make deals and say he is winning, but on the other hand he will not be taken advantage of.\n\nSo the choice is clear. Republicans need to lead in the lame-duck session and Democrats need to help where they can or get out of the way.\n\nThen when a new Congress arrives in January, Democrats need to reach across the aisle to advance legislation for the good of the country.\n\nDemocrats should remember that when President Clinton and President Obama suffered heavy midterm loses they still managed to get re-elected, in part because of the behavior of the opposition party and the way Republicans obstructed instead of governed.\n\nMany Democrats in Congress have tied themselves to the delusional and obsessive anti-Trump \u201cresistance\u201d movement. They need to remember that they weren\u2019t elected to come to Washington to stage protests and reflexively oppose everything the president and GOP lawmakers propose.\n\nThis is especially true for some of the young and far-left Democrats who call themselves democratic socialists and who support massive increases in government spending to fund a laundry list of expensive government programs. Voting for these measures means voting for big tax increases or unsustainable deficits that are likely to anger voters in 2020.\n\nI believe President Trump can lead Republicans to compromise with Democrats in the House and Senate for the remainder of this year and in 2019, but it will take three to tango \u2013 the House, Senate and White House.\n\nThe lame-duck session should operate under the motto of \u201cLead or get out of the way.\u201d The 2019 congressional session should operate under the motto of \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal.\u201d\n\nAnd Republicans who Pelosi turns to for support should ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for us?\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Louis Casiano", "title": "Patriot Prayer rally in Portland, Ore., leads to 6 arrests as groups clash", "description": "Dueling rallies in Portland, Ore., ended with members of the Patriot Prayer group and counter demonstrators clashing on Saturday, resulting in six arrests.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/six-arrested-in-dueling-portland-rallies-involving-patriot-prayer-group", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/pp1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T06:03:21Z", "content": "Dueling rallies in Portland, Ore., ended with members of the Patriot Prayer group and counter-demonstrators clashing on Saturday, resulting in six arrests.
