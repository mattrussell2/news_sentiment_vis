Colombia is grappling with a mass influx of Venezuelans fleeing the economic collapse in their neighboring homeland, and it's under pressure from the U.S. to reverse a boom in coca growing that has put output of the main ingredient for cocaine at record levels.\n\nDuque has seen his approval ratings slump, which could further undermine his ability to push his political and economic agenda. A recent poll said only 27 percent of Colombians approve of Duque's administration, down from 52 percent in August.\n\n\"So far he hasn't been able to keep anybody happy,\" said Sergio Guzman, a political risk consultant in Bogota. \"I think he must be realizing that governing this country is very difficult.\"\n\nThe administration has been most recently targeted by a wave of student protests that have disrupted life in Colombia's main cities and led to sporadic clashes with police. Student unions are demanding the government spend at least $1.5 billion on public universities that have seen enrollment quadruple over the past two decades.\n\nDuque has so far promised only a third of that amount, saying the government has no more resources available.\n\nTo raise more funds for education and social programs, Duque has proposed a 19 percent value added tax on staple goods such as eggs and milk. That is part of a broader tax measure that also would raise taxes on large inheritances and decrease the income tax for small businesses in a bid to generate more formal jobs.\n\nThe president's own party, the Democratic Center, has opposed the bill, saying taxing food staples could hurt the middle class. It leaves him without enough congressional support to pass the measure.\n\n\"We have to strengthen our work in congress,\" Duque said Friday during an interview with Colombia's BLU radio. He also called on politicians to avoid populist tactics and to engage in a \"reasonable\" discussion of the tax bill.\n\nDuque's administration has also been off to a rocky start in the countryside, where violence is on the rise in some areas that were formerly controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which has demobilized under a peace accord to end five decades of civil conflict.\n\nAccording to a report published Friday by the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think tank, 36 human rights leaders were killed in Colombia during the past three months, twice as many as in the same period last year. The number of people displaced by armed conflict increased by 20 percent, it said.\n\nMuch of the violence is happening in areas that are now under the influence of the National Liberation Army, a guerrilla group that hasn't made peace with Colombia's government.\n\nPeace talks with the group have been suspended under the Duque administration, which has said it will negotiate with the rebels only if they stop conducting kidnappings and staging attacks on the military.\n\nJuan Carlos Garzon, a conflict analyst at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, said Duque will have a hard time resuming the negotiations. His party is demanding tougher conditions for talks, including the withdrawal of amnesty for rebels who have been involved in drug trafficking.\n\n\"Duque was elected by people who were critical of the previous peace process with the FARC,\" Garzon said. \"But now that he is in power he has also realized that he must defend and pursue a peace process that is widely backed by the international community.\"\n\nDuque has acknowledged that many of his political proposals have been controversial. But on Friday he urged Colombians to be patient.\n\n\"I want the country to know that I will work each day to win the peoples' hearts,\" he told Blu Radio. \"And I want to prove that we are capable of transforming our realities.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Democrat Bill Nelson faces a math problem in Florida", "description": "As the hand recount of the Florida Senate race continues, incumbent Bill Nelson faces a deficit of more than 12,000 votes; Peter Doocy reports from Lauderhill, Florida.", "url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5968131767001/", "urlToImage": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/16/640/360/694940094001_5968133479001_5968131767001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:10:42Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Drivers get a break at the pump", "description": "Gas prices down for 37 straight days, the longest streak in more than three years.

It clearly is wholly or mainly due to human greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe study co-author who took responsibility for the error also made that point.\n\nTERRIFYING CLIMATE CHANGE WARNING: 12 YEARS UNTIL WE\u2019RE DOOMED\n\n\u201cThe evidence for ocean warming continues to be supported by millions of temperature readings throughout the oceans made by the international Argo network of sensors,\u201d Keeling told Fox News.\n\nThe Argo network of sensors consists of nearly 4,000 floats around the world that observe the ocean.

She missed her parents.\n\nOrbelina Orellana and Elmer Alberto Cardona were hundreds of miles and two countries away in a small town in southern Mexico, making their way toward the United States with thousands of others in a desperate caravan, leaving their loved ones behind.\n\nDespite the distance, Orellana was able to get a picture and audio recording from her daughter's birthday party in Honduras via WhatsApp and hear the little girl sob: \"I love you, Mommy,\" words that left the mother crushed.\n\n\"I didn't even want to get up,\" she said of the bittersweet moment.\n\nLike thousands of others, Orellana and her husband have relied on social media, text messages and brief cellphone calls to connect with worried loved ones back home as they traverse a country that can often be deadly for migrants.\n\nThe birthday recording gave her comfort and courage to continue the difficult journey of nearly 3,000 miles (nearly 5,000 kilometers) by foot, bus and hitchhiking as they head toward the Mexican border city of Tijuana.\n\nAt the frontier with San Diego, many in the caravan hope to ask for asylum in the United States, though it could take weeks or months as they take their places at the end of a line of thousands of others in the slow-moving application process.\n\nYears ago the migration trail north could be something of a black box. People might set out and not be heard from again until months later after reaching the U.S. and phoning from a relative's house, or suddenly showing up back home after being caught at the border and deported.\n\nTechnology has changed that.\n\nNot everyone in the caravan has a smartphone, and for those who do, coverage can be spotty in the Mexican countryside. At times it's hard to find a hotspot or a charge. But for those who do, they're precious cargo. Many share them with fellow migrants who eagerly log in to Facebook and other apps to send or receive a quick message.\n\nSome NGOs also facilitated free calls home for migrants, with the Red Cross organizing more than 4,000 of them.\n\nOrellana, 26, and Cardona, 27, have tried to call Brithani and her two siblings each evening when the caravan stops for the night, usually to sleep outdoors in public squares.\n\n\"I tell her I will always love her ... and she tells me not to miss her, that she is going to send for me,\" said Janeisy Nicolle, the couple's 5-year-old middle daughter.\n\nOften, in these brief conversations, neither side tells the whole truth for fear of causing worry.\n\nOrellana and Cardona, for example, didn't get into the fact that he had been stranded for a while on a desert highway in a dangerous part of Mexico, where migrants often fall prey to robbery, extortion, kidnapping and murder. Their loved ones didn't mention that some days they were low on rice and beans because the family's small pineapple farm wasn't producing anything to sell.\n\n\"Life is hard here,\" said Orellana's 29-year-old sister Deysi, now responsible for raising Brithani, Janeisy and their 9-year-old brother, Kenner Alberto. \"But it's hard up there too.\"\n\nMany in the caravan are traveling in family units; among them are at least 300 children below age 5, according to a count conducted when they paused for several days to rest in Mexico City. Many more children have been left with relatives so as not to expose them to the dangers of the trip.\n\nOrellana and Cardona are convinced they made the right choice in leaving their children behind and hope to reunite with their little ones if they make it to the United States and find work.\n\nViolent political protests in Honduras last year closed many of the stores where they used to buy small electronics goods to sell on the street. Ultimately they were spending almost everything they made on transportation, with little left for food.\n\nSo they borrowed money from the only people who lend to the poor in Honduras \u2014 gang members, who charge exorbitant interest. When they were unable to repay the $250, their debt suddenly became $700. Then the death threats started to come.\n\n\"If there is no way to pay it, they look for other ways,\" Orellana said. \"That's why I was afraid.\"\n\nOn top of it all, their small wooden home collapsed.\n\n\"They suffered a lot,\" said Orellana's mother, 69-year-old Evangelina Murillo.\n\nMurillo, who has cancer, lives with her daughter and son-in-law, two sons and now her three grandchildren in the two-room home donated by a local church in the rural outskirts of San Pedro Sula. It's a dangerous place: Another son was killed by a thief who was trying to steal his pig.\n\nThat kind of violence and poverty are the reasons cited again and again by migrants who joined the caravan.\n\nOrellana and Cardona had tried four years ago to emigrate from Honduras, only to be deported from Mexico. When they heard about the caravan on the TV news in October, they figured they didn't have anything to lose.\n\nThe hardest part was when Brithani held onto her mother and begged to come with them, crying, \"Don't leave me, mommy, don't leave me!\"\n\n\"I couldn't take her, the risk was too great,\" Orellana said, clutching at two Virgin of Guadalupe medals hanging around her neck, one of them engraved with the initials of her three kids.\n\nThe daily phone calls from Mexico stopped for a while when the couple's cellphone was stolen, until they started traveling with someone else who had one. During that time the only news their anxious family back home received was from the TV \u2014 scenes of tear gas and border clashes between migrants and Mexican police, and unfounded rumors that a child had died in those disturbances at a bridge between Guatemala and Mexico.\n\n\"When we see those images, we worry and I just ask God to take care of them for me,\" Murillo said.\n\nThinking about their children is the only thing that helped the couple when life got tough with the caravan. Like when they lost their IDs on the border bridge amid the clashes. Or clambering aboard foul-smelling garbage trucks to travel more quickly and keep up with the rest of the group. And the days of slogging dozens of miles (kilometers) underneath a baking sun, and falling sick when colder temperatures set in.\n\n\"Whenever I felt like returning, I told myself, 'Damn, I'd be going home to the same misery as always,'\" Orellana said. \"If I've come this far, I have to face whatever comes to provide a better life for my children.\"\n\nNearing Tijuana, the couple said they were still undecided whether they would try to cross into the United States or ask for refuge in Mexico.\n\nAnd on Sunday their thoughts will again be back home, this time with Janeisy: It's her sixth birthday."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Kids' postcards blanket Alpine glacier in eco-friendly stunt", "description": "Kids across the world expressed concerns about global warming by joining forces to create what organizers say is the world's biggest postcard on a glacier in the Swiss Alps.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/kids-postcards-blanket-alpine-glacier-in-eco-friendly-stunt", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-a1680fad802144ce9fcec12ab6d01750.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:48:40Z", "content": "ALETSCH GLACIER, Switzerland Kids across the world expressed concerns about global warming by joining forces to create what organizers say is the world's biggest postcard on a glacier in the Swiss Alps.

Last year, the league said Grabowski \"falsifies the history of Poland, proclaiming the thesis that Poles are complicit in the extermination of Jews.\"\n\n\"During World War II, due to the demoralizing circumstances and German actions, it is true that vile-acting individuals could be found among Poles and Jews alike,\" the group wrote in a statement signed by dozens of Polish academics. \"Yet, we should remember that the objective of the Germans was also to 'eradicate the Polish nation' and 'completely destroy Poland.'\"\n\nThe anti-defamation organization has been part of a broader effort under the government of the populist Law and Justice party to challenge research on Polish participation in the killing of Jews by Nazi Germany. Poland was under German occupation during World War II.\n\n\"What is important, from my point of view, is that the militant nationalists who nowadays hold sway in Poland be warned that they will be held to account, that they are wrong if they think that their outrageous statements and slanders will go unnoticed,\" Grabowski, who was born and attended university in Warsaw, told the AP.\n\nOfficial efforts under the Law and Justice government have included promoting the memory of the Polish gentiles who sheltered Jews during the war. Scholars who research Polish violence against Jews have faced censure and prosecution.\n\nThe issue came under international scrutiny earlier this year when Polish lawmakers voted to make it illegal to blame the nation for Holocaust crimes. The law has since been amended to remove prison as a possible punishment for violators, though individuals can still be tried and fined. The measure created a rift with Israel and was also condemned by the U.S.\n\nAlso Friday, the Polish ambassador to Germany, Andrzej Przylebski, accused Germans of frequently reducing World War II to the Holocaust \"as if Adolf Hitler was primarily or exclusively concerned with the murder of European Jews.\"\n\nAt a Berlin conference attended by the German foreign minister, Przylebski said Polish victims \"are almost completely forgotten or downplayed,\" according to a report from the Wirtualna Polska news portal.\n\nGrabowski's \"Hunt for the Jews: Betrayal and Murder in German-Occupied Poland\" documents the involvement of Poles in one rural area in finding and killing Jews who had escaped from ghettos and were trying to survive by hiding among gentiles. It was awarded the 2014 Yad Vashem International Book Prize for Holocaust Research.\n\nThe book also sparked heated debates, and the scholar says he received death threats after its publication. After a German newspaper reviewed the book favorably, a far-right Polish website ran an article with a photograph of the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. The headline was \"Sieg Heil, Herr Grabowski, Three Times Sieg Heil.\"\n\nGrabowski successfully sued for libel."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Are we reaching the end of the Mueller probe?", "description": "Trump says he has answered written questions from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, but they haven't been submitted yet; Former Whitewater prosecutor Robert Ray weighs in.", "url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5968098580001/", "urlToImage": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/16/640/360/694940094001_5968100373001_5968098580001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:33:37Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Madeleine Rivera", "title": "As border wall goes up in Texas, some local landowners put up a fight, others welcome it - Fox News", "description": "Fox News As border wall goes up in Texas, some local landowners put up a fight, others welcome it Fox News MISSION, Texas \u2013 Marianna Trevino-Wright, executive director of the National Butterfly Center, is preparing for the inevitable.

They\u2019re going to excavate the earth and levee, put in an 18-foot vertical concrete slab wall, and on top of that 18-foot steel bollards,\u201d said Trevino-Wright.\n\nIn the last two weeks, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, announced the construction of two additional border walls in Hidalgo County in southern Texas. One wall would stretch six miles and cut through the preserve, and the other would span eight miles.\n\nBoth contracts were awarded to Galveston-based SLSCO Ltd. The two projects, totaling $312 million, would begin in February.\n\nThe government in the beginning stages of building the border wall, recently started issuing right of entry requests, giving them the right to explore the land to figure out where to best put up the wall.\n\nThat has set up a potential battle between the government and longtime landowners in the area where the wall will go up.\n\n\u201cFor some of (the landowners), the land has been there for generations.

In October, the Trump administration waived 28 environmental and public-health laws to make way for the construction of 18 miles of border wall.\n\nWhile some local landowners here are against the wall, others are in favor of it, arguing they are fed up with migrants illegally entering the country through their land.\n\nOthal Brand, president of Hidalgo County Water Improvement District 3, also received a right of entry request \u2013 but he was happy about it.\n\n\u201cSome people say \u2018oh, you want a wall?\u2019 I believe in securing the border,\u201d Brand said. \u201cFor those that live in a city, they can have a level of security and safety. But those of use that work outside of the city and work along the river, it is a totally different environment.\u201d\n\nBrand, who has lived and worked along the river for generations, already has a border wall running through his land. He said he noticed a drop in illegal activity after it was built.\n\nConservation groups have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for the move, saying it will destroy the area\u2019s wildlife and natural habitat.\n\nBut, security experts believe there\u2019s a reason why the locations were chosen.\n\n\u201cI do understand the unfortunate nature of some of these locations. On the flip side, though, you\u2019re having these walls constructed in areas where you have heavy smuggling operations in both directions, which I think is an important aspect to remember here,\u201d said Fred Burton, chief security officer at Stratfor.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection has called the Rio Grande the busiest sector in the country. In the 2017 fiscal year, they arrested 137,000 illegal border crossers and seized 260,000 pounds of marijuana and 1,192 pounds of cocaine.\n\nCBP said they\u2019ve met with landowners not only to request access to the property for survey but to also listen to their concerns.\n\n\u201cConcerns are captured in order to incorporate them into the design of the wall,\u201d CBP officials said.\n\nOlivares is pushing for the CBP to hold an open community meeting, which he said has not been done. He said the format would allow for more productive dialogue instead of individual meetings with agents.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to tell them (the landowners) that they have rights,\u201d Olivares said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to do what the government tells them to do.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Will the Florida recount affect the GOP?", "description": "Sen.

They know that the majority of the 1,954-mile border is vulnerable and, even if caught, they can take advantage of our laws to stay in the U.S. illegally.\n\nEnough. We must secure our borders and stop migrants from abusing our immigration laws. President Trump knows this. That\u2019s why he has made border security \u2013 and a border wall \u2013 a priority.\n\nI\u2019m with President Trump. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve announced the first legislation that identifies how to fund the border wall.\n\nThe WALL Act would fully fund the $25 billion border wall by closing existing loopholes that allow illegal immigrants to receive federal benefits.\n\nFor too long, illegal immigrants have claimed refundable tax credits through Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) rather than a work-eligible Social Security number. By requiring work-authorized Social Security numbers for refundable tax credits, we\u2019ll save billions of dollars in tax credits that are only supposed to benefit American citizens or immigrants with legal status.\n\nMy bill would also ensure eligibility for federal welfare programs, like food stamps, by using E-Verify, a web-based system that allows enrolled employers to confirm the eligibility of their employees to work in the U.S. While we\u2019ve had laws on the books to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving these benefits for years, the system is vulnerable to document fraud.\n\nBy using E-Verify, we can ensure the integrity of our social safety net for the families who are lawfully entitled to it. We can also deter illegal immigration by imposing (and enforcing) a fine on illegal border crossings.\n\nI want to be clear \u2013 closing these loopholes would prevent federal benefits for illegal immigrants. Closing these loopholes would not impact the services or tax credits for citizens or legal immigrants.\n\nWe also need to reform our immigration laws, especially the asylum process, to create safeguards against fraud and abuse.\n\nI\u2019ve been to the border six times in the last five years and each time I hear the frustration from Customs and Border Patrol agents. They are inundated daily with rehearsed and scripted asylum claims. The data backs this up. Five years ago, only 1 out of 100 migrants claimed asylum. Today, it\u2019s 1 in 10.\n\nThat dramatic increase means we don\u2019t have the ability to detain families after they cross the border illegally and/or claim asylum. They are released with nothing more than an assigned court appearance, a process often known as \u201ccatch and release.\u201d\n\nIf migrants really wanted asylum, they\u2019d show up for their court dates and go through the proper legal channels. But their goal isn\u2019t really asylum; it\u2019s to circumvent our immigration laws. The proof? Approximately 75 percent of illegal immigrants have deportation orders for failure to appear in court.\n\nMy bill, the Asylum Abuse Reduction Act, would stop the abuse by requiring migrants to make an appointment with our embassies or consulates in Mexico for the screening and determination of their asylum claims. This would enable us to prevent many of the false claims of asylum that overwhelm our legal system.\n\nFor those immigrants who don\u2019t show up to court once in the United States, a criminal bench warrant would be issued for failure to appear.\n\nPresident Trump has made meaningful border security a priority and it is time for Congress to do the same by enacting my bills. It is what American families deserve \u2013 and even more, it is what the hardworking men and women who are abiding by our immigration process deserve."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Madeline Farber", "title": "Construction worker suicide rates are highest in the US, CDC study says - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Construction worker suicide rates are highest in the US, CDC study says Fox News Males working in construction have the highest suicide rates in the country, according to a recent analysis by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 war in the region and later annexed it. The move has been repeatedly condemned by the U.N.\n\nThe non-binding resolution, sponsored by countries including Cuba, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Venezuela, describes Israel's presence as an illegal occupation and calls on Israel \u201cto desist from changing the physical character, demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan and in particular to desist from the establishment of settlements.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. voted to abstain last year, but this year voted no, along with Israel, and cited the resolution\u2019s anti-Israel bias, the militarization of the Syrian Golan border, and a worsening humanitarian crisis as reasons for the change in the vote.\n\nUN'S SCATHING REPORTS STOKE US CONCERNS ABOUT ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS\n\nU.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley on Thursday called the resolution \u201cuseless\u201d and said if it ever made sense \u201cit surely does not today\u201d amid the atrocities by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\u201cThe resolution is plainly biased against Israel. Further, the atrocities the Syrian regime continues to commit prove its lack of fitness to govern anyone,\u201d she said in a statement. The destructive influence of the Iranian regime inside Syria presents major threats to international security. ISIS and other terrorist groups remain in Syria. And this resolution does nothing to bring any parties closer to a peace agreement. The United States will vote no.\u201d\n\nU.S. Political Advisor Samantha Sutton, in remarks to the committee on Friday, said that U.N. resolutions frequently blame Israel for problems in the region, without mentioning terrorist acts by Hamas. She also urged countries to focus on issues of genuine urgency in the region rather than \u201cgrandstanding against Israel.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Ambassador Danny Danon welcomed the U.S. move and called it \u201canother testament to the strong cooperation between the two countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank Ambassador Haley for her continued steadfastness with Israel and the truth. It is time for the world to distinguish between those who stabilize the region and those who sow terror,\u201d he said in a statement Thursday ahead of the vote.\n\nOn Friday, Dannon was defiant and told the committee that Israel will not withdraw from the area: \"Israel will not withdraw from the Golan Heights, it is time the international community accepts it.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. does not recognize Israel\u2019s claim to the territory but U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said in September that he could not imagine a situation where it is returned to Syria.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Friday that \u201cit\u2019s past time to acknowledge the reality of Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which should never come under the control of the Iran-backed Assad regime.\u201d\n\nSyria meanwhile hailed the vote and said the U.N. had sent a message that Israel was in \u201cviolation of the provisions of the [U.N.] Charter and of international law.\u201d\n\nISRAEL, HALEY ACCUSE UN OF IGNORING ATTACKS BY 'TERRORIST FLAMING SWASTIKA KITES'\n\nThe U.S. has been increasingly vocal at the U.N. in backing its closest ally in the Middle East, and pushing back against anti-Israel bias at the U.N.

You\u2019ll be able to see the most meteors after midnight on Nov. 17.\n\nThe shower will be visible across the country, though pollution, weather and the Moon could cloud the sky and prevent you from catching the show.\n\nSince the Leonids will \"radiate from the northeast,\" Accuweather says people in the western and southeastern part of the U.S. will have the best visibility.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nUnlike solar eclipses, which requires special equipment to view the astrological event, you don't need anything to spot this celestial event.\n\n\"Get to a dark spot, get comfortable, bring extra blankets to stay warm, and let your eyes adjust to the dark sky,\" NASA suggests. \"A cozy lounge chair makes for a great seat, as does simply lying on your back on a blanket, eyes scanning the whole sky.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Kaitlyn Schallhorn", "title": "Oprah's friend and self-help guru Marianne Williamson says she's considering a 2020 presidential bid - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Oprah's friend and self-help guru Marianne Williamson says she's considering a 2020 presidential bid Fox News Marianne Williamson, author and self-help guru, announced she's considering running for president in 2020.

She also admitted that she once got locked out of her hotel room naked in the middle of the night while searching for the bathroom.\n\n\"I was in Rome with my husband,\u201d she said, noting the hotel room was small. \"I get out of bed. I went to bed naked that night, and I had to go for a pee and I opened up the wrong door and I ended up in the hallway.\u201d\n\nBut Twain didn\u2019t just dish on her own life. She also was asked about other stars, specifically Taylor Swift\u2019s recent decision to go political. The Canadian singer received backlash after saying she would have voted for President Donald Trump, later apologizing for her comments.\n\nNICKI MINAJ PARTIES WITH SHANIA TWAIN\n\n\"This is a very personal thing. As an artist who is not a politician if you make a decision to cross that line and speak out about politics, do it at your own risk,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nShe also gushed about two unlikely celebrity pals in the music world \u2014 Nicki Minaj and Harry Styles.\n\nTwain met Minaj at Coachella, posing for an epic photo with the rapper and other stars like The Weeknd.\n\n\"She was so lovely. First of all, I\u2019m a big fan of hers, a huge fan of Nicki Minaj,\u201d she said. \"I told her I love her singing voice. She was very humble and just said, \u2018Oh, you know, I\u2019m not really a singer,\u2019 and I said, \u2018What! I love your singing voice.\u2019\u201d\n\nSHANIA TWAIN ON INFLUENCING HARRY STYLES AND A POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE WITH TAYLOR SWIFT\n\nAs for Styles, who has called Twain one of his biggest fashion inspirations, she noted, \"We have met. I love him. He\u2019s such a cutie! He\u2019s an incredible singer. He\u2019s a wonderful talent, and I want to work with him, so\u2026\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Brooke Crothers", "title": "Apple Black Friday deals: Here are some of the best iPhone, MacBook and iPad deals out there", "description": "Black Friday deals on the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook are so numerous across so many retailers that you need an Excel spread sheet to track them all.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/apple-black-friday-deals-here-are-some-of-the-best-iphone-macbook-and-ipad-deals-out-there", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/AppleIPhoneXSAPPhotoPatrickSison.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:33:01Z", "content": "Black Friday deals on Apple's iPhone, iPad and MacBook are so numerous across so many retailers that you might need a spreadsheet to track them all.

Practice, practice, practice. You just keep working it. (1:16)\n\nOn how Trump felt about having to give Acosta his press pass back: The President in his answer was very much at pains to act like this is, as he said, 'not a big deal.' Basically, they're saying we can't do it unilaterally we got to write some rules and then if you break the rules you got to give them due process. So he said we'll write some rules. I thought it was an interesting thing when he said, 'Look, if somebody acts out then I'll just end the news conference.' And as he pointed out all of the reporter's colleagues would be furious because it would mean they hadn't gotten their questions in. I did ask him, why not just don't call on Acosta. He didn't give a very good answer to that. Part of it I think is because it works for the both of them. (3:51)\n\nOn the backlash Trump got on Veterans' Day: First, it was the issue that he didn't go to the cemetery on Saturday in Paris when a lot of other leaders did and then it was the fact that when he was back in D.C. on Monday that he didn't to across the river to Arlington. Believe it or not this is the biggest news. He actually says he wishes he had a do-over. So, you'll get to hear about that, a very rare statement of regret from the President. (5:33)\n\nOn reports that Trump is isolated and stewing: It's the very first question I asked him. I said there are all these stories that you're angry, you're mad about the midterms, you're mad about the Mueller investigation, about the Paris trip, and in fact one newspaper actually said he is in a cocoon of resentment. And I said, 'So how dark is your mood?' He basically laughed and said, 'I couldn't be happier.' Again, he's a pretty good performer, but I have to say that we were there for an hour, between about 40 minutes in the Roosevelt Room and we went 10-15 minutes in the Oval Office, and he seemed in very good humor. (6:32)\n\nOn how Trump plans to deal with Democrats in the House: He says, 'Look Democrats have been in opposition. They've been able to sit back, fold their arms, and just be opposed to everything.' Now he says they're going to have a vested interest in trying to govern. So he says if they come up with some idea, not say that we're going to just accept it, but that perhaps could be the basis for negotiation between the Democratic House, The Republican Senate, and the White House. I think he's prepared to see if there are a few areas where they can agree and understanding there are going to be more areas where they can't. (9:28)\n\nOn the interview: I was surprised at how open he was, how candid he was, and there's a lot of news that will come out of this interview.

Portions of the mosaics have been revealed before, but this is the first time the artifacts have been shown in their full glory.\n\nDiscovered between 2014 and 2017 at the fifth-century synagogue in Huqoq, the panels paint a fascinating picture of life at the ancient site.\n\nSTUNNING BIBLICAL 'SPIES' MOSAIC DISCOVERED IN ISRAEL\n\n\u201cAlthough the story of Jonah was popular in early Christian art, this is the first time it has been found decorating an ancient synagogue,\u201d Excavation Director and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Professor Jodi Magness told Fox News, via email. \u201cThe Huqoq version is unusual in showing three large fish swallowing Jonah, and representing the storm winds (in the upper left corner) as Harpy-Sirens \u2013 half-female, half-bird creatures from Greek mythology.\u201d\n\nMagness also notes that the panel depicting the Tower of Babel shows different construction activities around the tower, such as the quarrying of stone, woodworking and the use of a giant pulley. The mosaic provides important evidence for ancient building techniques, she explained.\n\nAdditionally, the panel\u2019s depiction of the Tower\u2019s workers is noteworthy. \u201cThe workmen have different hairstyles, clothing, and skin colors, to represent the various peoples who participated in the tower\u2019s construction,\u201d Magness said. \u201cA fight is shown breaking out between two of them after God confounded their languages.\"\n\n'JESUS' FACE' UNCOVERED AT ANCIENT CHURCH IN THE ISRAELI DESERT\n\nEarlier this year, researchers also announced the discovery of a stunning mosaic depicting a biblical scene from Numbers 13:23. Labeled \"a pole between two,\" the panel shows two spies sent by Moses to explore the biblical land of Canaan.\n\nThe first mosaics at the site were discovered in 2012. Experts say that the wealth of mosaics show that Jewish life in the surrounding village flourished during Christian rule in the fifth century A.D. This challenges a widely held view that Jewish settlement in the area declined during that period.\n\nAnother mosaic discovered at Huqoq includes a depiction of Samson. There is also an ongoing debate about whether a mosaic uncovered in 2016 portrays Alexander the Great. The purported Alexander the Great mosaic is the first non-biblical story ever found decorating an ancient synagogue.\n\n'SHIPS IN THE DESERT': STRANGE 2,000-YEAR-OLD GRAFFITI DISCOVERED IN ISRAEL\n\nThe researchers\u2019 latest study is featured in the Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research.\n\nThe Huqoq Excavation Project involves experts from a host of universities, including Baylor University, Brigham Young University and the University of Toronto. Magness has been working with Shua Kisilevitz of the Israel Antiquities Authority and Tel Aviv University on the excavations every summer.\n\nThe mosaics are the latest in a series of fascinating archaeological finds in Israel. In a separate project, engravings of ships were found on an ancient water cistern discovered in Israel's Negev desert.\n\nANCIENT INSCRIPTION DISCOVERY THRILLS ARCHAEOLOGISTS IN ISRAEL\n\nArchaeologists also recently confirmed the first full spelling of \u201cJerusalem\u201d on an ancient stone inscription excavated in the area of Jerusalem\u2019s International Convention Center, known as Binyanei Ha'Uma.\n\nIn another project, experts discovered a site that may offer fresh insight into the ancient biblical kingdom of David and Solomon. In a separate archaeological dig, a trove of bronze coins, the last remnants of an ancient Jewish revolt against the Roman Empire, were recently discovered near the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\n\nIn February, archaeologists announced the discovery of a clay seal mark that may bear the signature of the biblical Prophet Isaiah.\n\nLOST ROMAN CITY THAT WAS HOME TO JESUS' APOSTLES FOUND, SAY ARCHAEOLOGISTS\n\nOther recent finds include the skeleton of a pregnant woman, dating back 3,200 years, in Israel\u2019s Timna Valley, at a place once called King Solomon\u2019s Mines.\n\nAt the site of an ancient city on the West Bank, archaeologists are also hunting for evidence of the tabernacle that once housed the Ark of the Covenant.\n\nSome experts also believe they have found the lost Roman city of Julias, formerly the village of Bethsaida, which was the home of Jesus' apostles Peter, Andrew and Philip.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Kathleen Joyce", "title": "Former Alabama state trooper killed after shooting district attorney in face, official says - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Former Alabama state trooper killed after shooting district attorney in face, official says Fox News A county prosecutor was shot in the face in rural western Alabama on Thursday before officers fatally wounded the suspect: a former state trooper who\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/alabama-state-trooper-killed-after-shooting-district-attorney-in-face-official-says", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Gregory-Griggers.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:10:04Z", "content": "A county prosecutor was shot in the face in rural western Alabama on Thursday before officers fatally wounded the suspect: a former state trooper who once was questioned in another shooting.

In addition to sweeping away dust and dirt, some of the released gas may have covered the surface of 'Oumuamua with a reflective coat of ice and snow - a phenomenon that's also been observed in comets in our solar system.\"\n\nThe study's abstract only adds further intrigue as to why NASA never saw it when it pointed its telescope at the object in November.\n\n\"Both our size and outgassing limits are important because 'Oumuamua's trajectory shows non-gravitational accelerations that are sensitive to size and mass and presumably caused by gas emission,\" the study's abstract reads. \"We suggest that 'Oumuamua may have experienced low-level post-perihelion volatile emission that produced a fresh, bright, icy mantle.\"\n\nNASA added that it placed limits on how much carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were expected to come from the object, but added that another gas species \u2014 \"probably H2O\" \u2014 caused the \"observed non-gravitational acceleration.\"\n\nOumuamua was discovered in October 2017 by Canadian physicist and astronomer Robert Weryk.\n\nMYSTERIOUS INTERSTELLAR OBJECT IS NOT AN ALIEN PROBE, SAYS ASTRONOMER WHO DISCOVERED IT\n\nBecause of the varying degrees of brightness emanating from Oumuamua's surface, NASA suggests it is \"highly elongated and probably less than half a mile (2,600 feet, or 800 meters) in its longest dimension.\"\n\nThe intrigue of what Oumuamua is or isn't has picked up a considerably over the past few weeks, especially as some researchers have theorized that it could be an object from an extraterrestrial civilization.\n\nA study from the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics says the object could be \"a lightsail of artificial origin\" sent from another civilization. \"Considering an artificial origin, one possibility is that \u2018Oumuamua is a lightsail, floating in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment,\" researchers Shmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb wrote in a paper.\n\nWeryk called that idea preposterous and just \"wild speculation,\" though he did note that the speed of the object was unusual.\n\n\"There's a maximum speed that you can be traveling to be bound gravitationally by the sun,\" Weryk told Canadian outlet CBC in an interview. \"When we first saw this object, it was traveling faster than that, so we know for a fact that it's from outside our solar system. We decided that it was a comet that had a bit of outgassing that wasn't visible from the ground, which is why it didn't appear to be a comet.\"\n\nHe continued: \"(The Harvard researchers) decided to focus on another aspect of that, that it's an alien spacecraft and that it has a solar sail type material that's causing the non-gravitational trajectory. But we actually believe that's not true based on the data we obtained.\"\n\nIn an email to Fox News, Loeb said his and Bialy's paper \"attempts to explain the excess force\" that acted on Oumuamua when observed and Weryk's reaction \"shows prejudice.\"\n\nCOMETS AND ASTEROIDS COULD BE FLINGING LIFE ALL OVER THE GALAXY, STUDY FINDS\n\n\"Our paper follows the standard scientific methodology: an anomaly is observed in data, the standard explanation fails to explain it and so an alternative interpretation is proposed,\" Loeb wrote in the email. \"I encourage anyone with a better explanation to write a paper about it and publish it. Any wrong interpretation can be ruled out when more data will be released on `Oumuamua or other members of its population in the future. A reaction of the type you quoted shows prejudice.\"\n\nNASA has been steadfast that it is a \"metallic or rocky object\" and is likely a comet.\n\nSo will we ever learn more about why it was so bright or why it has unusual acceleration?\n\nINTERSTELLAR VISITOR 'OUMUAMUA' NEVER SHOULD HAVE LEFT HOME, THEORIES SAY\n\n\u201cUsually, if we get a measurement from a comet that\u2019s kind of weird, we go back and measure it again until we understand what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said NASA\u2019s Davide Farnocchia, one of the study's co-authors. \u201cBut this one is gone forever; we probably know as much about it as we\u2019re ever going to know.\u201d\n\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Jason Bonewald", "title": "Florida Counts", "description": "FOX News Radio's National Correspondent Jared Halpern along with a team of FOX News reporters & contributors look at the week that was inside the beltway.

But she is facing a brewing revolt from her own members, with a number of Democrats signing a letter pledging not to support her.\n\nFox News confirmed Thursday that at least 17 House Democrats, including incumbents and incoming members, have signed on to a document saying they will not support Pelosi on the House floor for speaker. A Democrat familiar with the effort says they are trying to add more names before the letter is publicly released.\n\nIf all those Democrats vote against Pelosi on the floor, Pelosi would not have the votes for speaker. To get the gavel, Pelosi will first need to pick up a majority of the Democratic caucus in internal leadership elections, then go on to win an absolute majority of the House.\n\n'NEVER NANCY' REVOLT BREWING AGAINST PELOSI, AS REBELLIOUS HOUSE DEMS REFUSE SUPPORT FOR SPEAKER BID\n\nBut as she faces an increasingly tight race, a number of Republicans are floating the idea of offering her support in the House -- thinking that it would help them in the long term.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted after the midterms that if she struggled, \u201cperhaps we will add some Republican votes\u201d although it was not clear if this remark was serious or tongue-in-cheek.\n\nOn Thursday, Republican Tom Reed said that if Pelosi embraced a bipartisan package of rules reforms that would make it easier for members to get legislation to the floor, he could envision supporting her.\n\n\u201cA Democratic candidate who embraces these rules reforms, I will stand with,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI am so frustrated with this institution being a top-down driven organization...it is time to change this and if Nancy Pelosi is the only one that\u2019s there, I\u2019m open to it.\u201d\n\nReed did concede that there would be \u201csignificant backlash\u201d from other Republicans. But other Republicans have also suggested backing her bid -- as it could help them in the long term.\n\n\"She reminds the American people why they don't like politics. She reminds them why they don't like Democrats, quite frankly,\" Republican strategist Chris Wilson said Friday on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \"The best thing in the world for Republicans is to have her in that role.\"\n\nCiting Trump\u2019s remarks last week, Wilson suggested that Republicans should back the California Democrat.\n\n\"Republicans are not going to have a speaker of the House. So why not try and ... put her back in that chair?\" he asked.\n\nPelosi, at a press conference Thursday, she dismissed the idea that she would need Republican help to win the gavel.\n\n\"Oh please, never,\" she said. \"Never, never, come on.\"\n\n\"I intend to win the speakership with Democratic votes,\" she later said, adding that she had \"overwhelming support\" in her caucus.\n\nIn 2016, Pelosi fended off a leadership challenge from Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cCavuto,\u201d Ryan said, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a done deal yet\u201d in terms of Pelosi becoming speaker again. Ryan also says he \u201chopes somebody does\u201d challenge Pelosi.\n\nOn Friday, Pelosi met for 45 minutes with Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, who is mulling a prospective leadership challenge.\n\nOther Democrats have been more supportive. House Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told Fox News Friday that \u201cshe has the experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s someone who get things done. We don\u2019t need someone with a learning curve,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cwe need to deliver some real wins pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Alex Pappas, Mike Emanuel and Chad Pergram contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Greg Norman", "title": "Mufasa the white lion's legal battle heats up as sanctuary fears rare animal will be auctioned off to hunters", "description": "A South Africa wildlife sanctuary is gearing up Friday for an extended legal battle against the country's government over custody of a rare lion it fears will be auctioned off and killed amid a growing international outcry.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/mufasa-the-white-lions-legal-battle-heats-up-as-sanctuary-fears-rare-animal-will-be-auctioned-off-to-hunters", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Mufasa.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:49:03Z", "content": "A South African wildlife sanctuary is gearing up for an extended legal battle against the country\u2019s government over custody of a rare white lion it fears will be auctioned off and killed amid a growing international outcry.

Its lawyer, in an online petition that has garnered more than 200,000 signatures, wrote that only 300 of his kind are left in the world, 13 of which exist in the wild.\n\nSouth African police reportedly gave the lion to the sanctuary in late 2015 after confiscating it from the person who owned him as a pet, because the owner failed to have the proper permits.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s North West Department of Rural, Environmental and Agricultural Development is now trying to get back custody of Mufasa, according to the Sunday Times. The newspaper says the criminal case involving its owner has been resolved, and the department had originally planned to move the lion to another, larger sanctuary at that point.\n\nHowever, the leader of the Rustenburg Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre claims she has been told by three officials that Mufasa is going to be auctioned off to \u201crecover legal costs.\u201d\n\nBIG-GAME HUNTERS DEFEND KILLS, SAY THEY WON'T BACK DOWN AFTER RECEIVING BACKLASH FOR POSTING PHOTOS\n\n\u201cIn the last few weeks we have seen and read extensively about what happens to lions in the industry,\u201d the sanctuary wrote on a fundraising page. \u201cThis means there is only one of two options left.\n\n\u201cPlease help us prevent the atrocity of having this beautiful lion condemned to a trophy or a bag of bones,\u201d it added.\n\nThe Sunday Times reported that the department, in a court filing, has denied that Mufasa will be auctioned. South African officials did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News.\n\nThe sanctuary now says the case over Mufasa\u2019s custody rights is headed to a higher court and it has raised more than $7,000 in legal fees to aid in that area.\n\n\u201cWe tried to stay in regional court to prevent the escalation, but the department has now forced our hand, hence the increase in fundraising effort,\u201d it wrote.\n\nThe tug-of-war over the lion also has attracted outrage from celebrities, including \u2018Gladiator\u2019 actor Russell Crowe and comedian Ricky Gervais.\n\n\"We are given dominion over animals because of our intelligence (questionable), to me, that dominion has an implicit duty of care,\" Crowe tweeted in October. \"A person who derives pleasure from killing animals is as sick as any murderer #stoptrophyhunting\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Hollie McKay", "title": "Chapo's beauty queen wife living lavishly - away from the courtroom - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Chapo's beauty queen wife living lavishly - away from the courtroom Fox News She's been dubbed the Kim Kardashian look-alike of Mexico \u2013 a raven-haired, perfectly made up beauty queen fond of flaunting her designer dresses, oversized sunglasses and b\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/kim-kardashian-of-mexico-meet-el-chapos-young-beauty-queen-wife-living-the-us-mexico-high-life", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ny-emma-coronel.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:41:02Z", "content": "She's been dubbed the Kim Kardashian look-alike of Mexico \u2013 a raven-haired, perfectly made up beauty queen fond of flaunting her designer dresses, oversized sunglasses and bikini body for what was a growing flock of followers across social media.

Others, not so much.\n\nMeet Emma Coronel Aispuro, the 29-year-old wife of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, and the mother of their twin 7-year-old daughters.\n\n\u201cEmma doesn\u2019t appear to be too shy, and continues to stay in the forefront with social media exposure,\u201d Lenny DePaul, a retired Chief Inspector and Commander of the U.S Marshals Service, told Fox News. \"She is now, and always was, someone to flaunt for the notorious drug lord.\u201d\n\nHer \u201cpublic figure\u201d Instagram account as of Thursday had more than 400,000 followers - and was groing rapidly by the day. Until it was apparently deactivated.\n\nAmong the posted content was a video posing for a selfie outside court with an apparent fan, paparazzi pictures of her donning all black, and flanked by guards and umbrellas heading out of the first day of her husband\u2019s trial on Tuesday, along with the caption in Spanish \u201cno matter what happens, I promised to be always and here I am. I\u2019ll love you all my life.\u201d\n\nThere were also snaps of a glammed-out Aispuro lounging poolside, surrounded by paparazzi as she strolls to her waiting car in oversized sunglasses, shooting a gun at an indoor range (with the phrase \u201cpracticing\u201d), taking in a Yankees game, posing in a bikini on the beach, selfies with a \u201cHalloween\u201d reveler dressed El Chapo, and holding the hands of her twin daughters \u2013 who are always seen in matching dresses - and even have matching Louis Vuitton handbags.\n\nBut the pictures that hit the headlines \u2013 and ignited a firestorm \u2013 were from the elaborate Barbie-themed birthday party she threw in September to celebrate the twins seventh birthday. The lavish affair featured life-sized Barbie mannequins, thousands of balloons and flowers, carnival-style rides, and a Barbie \"Boutique,\" all staged at a location that looked like a Hollywood movie set.\n\nThose twins, by the way, were both born American citizens, since Aispuro crossed the Mexican border and gave birth to them at a hospital in Lancaster, Calif. - without filling in the paternal name on either birth certificate. Aispuro and her husband may have gotten that idea from her own experience since she, too, was born in Northern Calfifornia, even though her father was a known member of the Sinaloa drug cartel.\n\nAnd what appears to be her twitter account - it's unverified - has been largely dedicated to her husband, filled with shout-outs in Spanish. But the account hasn't seen much action since last year.\n\n\u201cThe night arrives and my heart remembers you, here where you always reside and where no one will erase you or replace you,\u201d she wrote two days after Guzm\u00e1n was extradited to the United States, in January 2017.\n\nAispuro is believed to Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s third or the fourth wife \u2013 with whom he married before divorcing at least one or two others. The other former spouses, according to officials in Mexico, lead very under-the-radar lives.\n\nGuzman met Aispuro on a dance floor, when she was just 17. Months later, Guzm\u00e1n reportedly paid to ensure she won a Coffee and Guava Festival beauty contest in Canelas, Mexico \u2013 although she has denied the sash was earned by anything by merit.\n\nMost recently, Aispuro swapped her more curve-hugging designer duds for conservative blouses and streamlined black suits, for courthouse appearances.\n\nDerek Maltz, former Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration Special Operations Division in New York, surmised Aispuro is ultimately playing a strategic public relations campaign.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the defense team is showcasing Emma and the kids in public so people may feel sorry for this man who will most likely be in jail the rest of his life,\u201d he said. \u201cChapo was well-known to be a ladies\u2019 man in Mexico and it didn\u2019t seem like Emma played a major role in his life during the height of his criminal activities.\u201d\n\nUNPRECEDENTED SECURITY PROTECTING JURORS, OTHERS AT EL CHAPO TRIAL\n\nMANIPULATION, FEAR, SNITCHES, AND A NEW CELL: BEHIND THE SCENES AS EL CHAPO GOES TO TRIAL\n\nIn recent years, she has also taken on the role of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s human rights and prison rights advocate. Soon after he was re-captured by Mexican authorities in 2016, she gave a demure, poised interview to Telemundo expressing concerns that the guards \u201cdon\u2019t let him sleep and he has no privacy,\u201d that she was \u201cafraid\u201d for his life and softly requesting that they treat him well and with dignity.\n\nAispuro has since campaigned for her husband before an array of humanitarian groups in Washington D.C., including the Organization of American States. She has also advocated for his rights while behind bars in New York.\n\nWhile Aispuro\u2019s apparent breeziness and love for her husband, despite him once being the most feared man in the world, the dark underworld of cartels is said to be nothing new to her.\n\n\u201cShe is the daughter of another Mexican drug trafficker, so she was brought up in the business. They had to be married deep in Sinaloa countryside and their \u2018reception\u2019 amounted to a party on one of his ranches up in the hills,\u201d said one former DEA official, referring to their secretive, July, 2007 nuptials. \u201cAs a U.S. citizen, she was able to legally cross the border and gave birth to Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s twin daughters in California, thus ensuring they too were U.S. citizens.\u201d\n\nSeveral other law enforcement officials also confirmed that, while his formal occupation was as a cattle rancher, Aispuro\u2019s father, In\u00e9s Coronel Barreras, was connected to high levels of the Sinaloa cartel, and was believed to have cultivated opium poppies and marijuana.\n\nIncidentally, no photographs of their wedding have ever surfaced.\n\nHer lifestyle and penchant for Prada purses, however, raises questions about how she lives the high life. Although the U.S indictment against Guzm\u00e1n asserts he was worth some $14 billion, it seems little south of the border has been seized \u2013 allowing her to lead a life of luxury.\n\nAccording to DePaul, when it comes to freezing and seizing assets owned by the notorious drug lord, the onus is on the Mexican authorities to \u201ctake the lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure the investigators here in the U.S. have been looking at Emma Aispuro for some time and will continue to monitor her digital footprints and her every move. Sadly, the millions of dollars, as well as real estate and jewelry, makes for a great bargaining tool when it comes to corruption,\u201d contended DePaul. \u201cIt is a known fact that the bribing of prison officials and Mexican law enforcement existed when he escaped from his jail cell.\u201d\n\nJ.T. Patten, a former government intelligence operative, told Fox News Aispuro's expenses are \u201cpaid for in cash and or are \u2018arranged\u2019 payments through family, business associates, and legal counsel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am quite certain that anything around her has been \u2018legitimized\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most likely, any illicit connections have been cut.\u201d\n\nAccording to one U.S. government official connected to the Guzm\u00e1n case, Aispuro is in the clear of any wrongdoing. A well-placed Mexican law enforcement source also told Fox News that investigations determined \u201cChapo and Emma\u2019s dad decided not to involve Emma in his criminal net.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a mid to high-level house in Mexico City,\u201d said the source. \u201cBut people still wonder why she has all those nice things.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican Government\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as the Mexican Embassy in Washington, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother Mexican law enforcement authority asserted that Aispuro is loved in Sinaloa, but outside that sphere \"is not well-liked.\"\n\n\u201cMexicans are frustrated over the way this person can spend the illegal proceeds. So much money has been made over the last 30 years but this ruthless criminal,\u201d said Maltz. \u201cEmma\u2019s side circus should not distract anyone now that has the job of convicting Chapo and serving justice for all those who have died due to Cartels.\u201d\n\nAispuro cannot be compelled to testify against Guzm\u00e1n, under the marital defense. But DePaul stressed \u201cauthorities are not taking any risks with regards to Emma and El Chapo.\u201d\n\nShe has been denied permission for visitation to converse with her husband since his extradition from Mexico to the U.S in January 2017 \u2013 being branded as something of a security liability. Their contact has thus been nothing more than a wave across the courtroom, with Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s request to \u201chug his wife\u201d denied by the judge last week.\n\nDespite a flagrant reputation of philandering with prostitutes and other ladies \u2013 Aispuro is said to have remained deeply dedicated to the kingpin, who she incessantly proclaims as the love of her life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a balance between looking like a princess but remaining part of the people,\u201d Patten added. \u201cShe will need to come off like a beloved celebrity over a greedy elite dictator\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\nAispuro did not respond to an interview request."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Kathleen Joyce", "title": "Selfie saves Texas man from serving up to 99 years in prison - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Selfie saves Texas man from serving up to 99 years in prison Fox News They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but a selfie turned out to be priceless for one Texas man.

Despite announcing the sex of Underwood's second child and featuring performances from the biggest stars in the genre, the country music award show was down 30 percent from last year's event.\n\nThe 52nd annual CMA Awards attracted 10.1 million viewers, the lowest-rated broadcast ever, according to Hollywood trade publication Deadline.\n\n\u201cThis is the latest in a long line of live programming that has suffered serious ratings erosion over the years. Back in September, for example, the 2018 Emmy Awards hit a new viewership low as well, clocking in with just 10.2 million viewers,\u201d Variety ratings guru Joe Otterson wrote.\n\nDeadline noted that the CMAs dropped a whopping 34 percent in the key demographic and lost 30 percent of total viewers compared to the 2017 version of the show. Even with the record low viewership, the three-hour telecast still landed ABC its best non-sports performance on a particular night in over a year.\n\nBut even though the night was politics-free, some experts think the political bent of similar events still hurt the CMAs.\n\nMedia Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News that events like the Oscars and Emmys set a precedent that the CMAs couldn\u2019t overcome.\n\n\u201cThe CMAs are victims of how politicized award shows have become.

It's the first time that the Oscars averaged fewer than 30 million people since at least 1974 when Nielsen started keeping track. Many critics blamed the \u201cdivisive, left-wing politics\u201d throughout the four-hour event for the dismal rating \u2013 but the CMA Awards can\u2019t make the same excuse.\n\nCo-hosts Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood had promised the show wouldn\u2019t be loaded with polarizing politics and the country superstars kept their word. Politics was not a topic of discussion when the biggest names in the genre took the stage during Wednesday night's show at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena.\n\nMRCTV blog editor Craig Bannister echoed Gainor and feels that \u201cpropaganda-filled shows\u201d have \u201csoured viewers,\u201d pointing to a study that indicated 43 percent of respondents are \u201cless likely to watch\u201d events such as awards shows \u201cbecause they\u2019ve gotten too political.\u201d Bannister noted that 74 percent of respondents tune in to award shows \u201cto get away from politics and do not want to be bombarded with partisan political messages.\u201d\n\nABC News\u2019 \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Joy Behar even slammed then CMAs for not diving into politics\n\n\u201cMy personal belief is that we are in an emergency.

While not everyone is an avid offender, it\u2019s not uncommon for drinkers to engage in risky behavior either.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is highlighting a new recommendation in hopes of curbing that trend. Their review, published in the JAMA Network on Tuesday, found that general care physician screening can help.\n\nThey\u2019re recommending that these doctors conduct screening for alcohol misuse in adults over 18. If patients are found to be drinking too much, \u201cbrief counseling\u201d should follow.\n\nDUTCH TEEN DIES AFTER INHALING DEODORANT SPRAY TO GET HIGH\n\n\u201cThe net benefit of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in adults, including pregnant women, is moderate,\u201d states the paper.\n\nYes, it\u2019s true. Overusing alcohol has turned into a nationwide problem.\n\nThe review attests that nearly 90,000 deaths from 2006-2010 were related to alcohol. That included both injuries from car accidents and alcohol overuse.\n\nMany professionals agree that something must be done. That\u2019s why the USPSTF committed to their investigation in the first place.\n\nHowever, the evidence behind their recommendation appears limited.\n\nThe USPSTF came to their conclusion based on evidence with physicians who already provide some screening. But no studies actually evaluated the effectiveness of alcohol screening directly.\n\nPerhaps this new recommendation warrants a formal study.\n\nMEDITATION HELPS VETS WITH PTSD\n\nAt the same time, evidence also proved inconclusive as to the benefits of screening adolescents (those between ages 12 and 17).\n\nFurthermore, other hurdles for the USPSTF recommendation include how much burden it could place on doctors\u2019 already weighty responsibilities.\n\nYes, a simple screening question like \u201cHow much alcohol do you drink?\u201d might provide some accountability.\n\nBut if patients answer yes, how much time and effort should doctors spend on the \u201cbrief counseling?\u201d Likewise, how will they evaluate whether their efforts are successful?\n\nThere are no current standards for alcohol recovery as it is.\n\nIn addition, such screening could place the burden of responsibility on doctors rather than alcohol users.\n\nPerhaps screening by general care doctors is a good idea. However, the evidence may not be strong enough to implement rigorous change.\n\nResearchers should look into other means of catching and treating alcohol misuse. In the meantime, at least general care doctors can choose whether they will conduct screening in their own practices.\n\nWhat is Alcohol Misuse?\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, moderate drinking is defined as no more than one drink per day for women and twp per day for men.\n\nAnything above four drinks per day for men (or three for women) is considered alcohol misuse. Binge drinking isn\u2019t far beyond that level either.\n\nThe point is that alcohol users have to be careful. It\u2019s easy to go past the recommended amounts, especially with holiday celebrations coming up.\n\nWhether or not general care doctors decide to screen, alcohol users should take responsibility. They should not exceed recommended alcohol amounts, and that includes carefully monitoring the type of alcohol too.\n\nAccording to the CDC, one drink is defined as:\n\n? 12 ounces of beer\n\n? 8 ounces of malt liquor\n\n? 5 ounces of wine\n\n? 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits or hard liquor (3)\n\nAlcohol users should do their best to stay educated on and aware of their drinking habits. If people find themselves taking risks or binge drinking, they should seek help and accountability from friends, family and notable recovery centers."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Ryan Gaydos", "title": "Popular Cleveland reporter, 30, killed by uncle in murder-suicide, authorities say - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Popular Cleveland reporter, 30, killed by uncle in murder-suicide, authorities say Fox News A popular Cleveland reporter found shot to death Monday inside a trailer with her uncle was killed by her relative in a murder-suicide, investigators said Wed\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/popular-cleveland-reporter-30-killed-by-uncle-in-murder-suicide-authorities-say", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Nikki-Delamotte-2-facebook.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:37:47Z", "content": "A popular Cleveland reporter found shot to death Monday inside a trailer with her uncle was killed by her relative in a murder-suicide, investigators said Wednesday.

In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass. We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.

The temporary order lasts for 14 days and CNN can now petition the Court for a permanent injunction.\n\n\u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days. Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press,\u201d CNN said in a statement.\n\nThe judge, a Trump appointee, declared that precedent had been set that the White House should have given Acosta due process before taking away his credential and that harm to the reporter had already occurred. He said that CNN is likely to succeed on Fifth Amendment grounds and that the harm to Acosta outweighs the government's need for an orderly press conference.\n\n\u201cI want to thank all of my colleagues in the press who supported us this week and I want to thank the judge for the decision he made today.

Later in the day, Acosta\u2019s credential was revoked.\n\nCNN filed the federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday demanding that the White House restore the press credential of the star reporter -- but Sanders called the move \u201cmore grandstanding from CNN.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration countered the motion, saying Acosta \u201cdisrupted the fair and orderly administration of a press conference\u201d when he refused to give up the microphone. Judge Kelly dismissed the Trump administration\u2019s claim that CNN could simply send another reporter in Acosta\u2019s place and told attorneys to file additional court papers in the case by Monday.\n\nTrump addressed the situation himself, demanding decorum, on Thursday after signing a cybersecurity and infrastructure bill.\n\n\u201cYou have to practice decorum,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want total freedom of the press, that\u2019s very important to me... but you have to act with respect, you\u2019re in the White House.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Fox News announced that it would support CNN\u2019s effort to restore Acosta\u2019s White House credential and filed an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court.\n\n\u201cFox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter\u2019s press credential.

Judge Mark Walker said Thursday counties have until Saturday afternoon to notify those people so they can rectify the situation.\n\nHe declined to extend recount deadlines earlier this week, despite a lawsuit from the Democratic Party which contended some larger counties did not have the means to meet them. Broward County submitted its recount two minutes after the state\u2019s 3 p.m. deadline \u2013 making its machine recount tally void.

The suit wants to bar him from having any influence over the canvassing process or authority to suspend election supervisors.\n\nAs for Scott, his campaign sought to have voting machines in Broward and Palm Beach counties impounded by law enforcement when they were not in use.

Cars abandoned. People distraught, freezing and starving. 5 inches of snow. 5 INCHES. C\u2019mon y\u2019all. We can do better,\u201d the commuter added, noting her next stop is to the babysitter who had to look after her children overnight.\n\nThe storm Thursday contributed to at least seven deaths around the country, according to the Associated Press. In the northeast, parts of New York received more than 18 inches of snow, the National Weather Service says, while dozens of communities in New Jersey and Connecticut recorded at least six inches.\n\nMany who got stuck in the frozen mess blamed public officials for appearing to be underprepared as road conditions quickly grew treacherous.\n\n\u201cSomebody dropped the ball. No way a few inches of slush should bring the greatest city in the world to its knees,\u201d New York City Democratic councilman Justin Brannan lamented on Twitter. \u201cI've got constituents saying it took them 4 hours to get home. And not a snow plow in sight. WTF happened?\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s Sanitation Department, according to the New York Post, said it initially sent out 700 salt spreaders but \u201cthe afternoon snowfall was much heavier than had been forecast.\u201d\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio told 1010 WINS the plows were out and they had salt.\n\n\u201cWe had a bit, if you\u2019ll forgive the phrase, of a perfect storm -- of the timing and the intensity for a brief period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then really this huge crash on the George Washington Bridge was a big, big contributing factor here.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a camel was spotted Thursday on the side of the road in Souderton, outside of Philadelphia, after the truck carrying it stopped in the snow.\n\nA school principal in Lower Moreland, also in that area, read books to students stuck on an elementary school bus over the FaceTime app, trying to calm them and adding the \u201cgrown-ups\u201d would be getting them home safely, WFXT reported."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Meditation helps vets with post-traumatic stress disorder - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Meditation helps vets with post-traumatic stress disorder Fox News Meditation worked as well as traditional therapy for military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder in a small experiment sponsored by the Department of Defense.

The VA already is using meditation, yoga and similar approaches to supplement traditional therapy with PTSD, said Paula Schnurr, executive director of the VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD.\n\nWhile the three-month study adds to evidence supporting these lifestyle practices, Schnurr said, more research is needed to learn how long meditation\u2019s benefits last.\n\nPTSD: WHAT IS IT AND HOW TO SPOT IT\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no follow-up in this study,\u201d Schnurr noted, and one therapist did 80 percent of the exposure therapy so the findings hinge largely on one therapist\u2019s skills.\n\nResearchers measured symptoms in about 200 San Diego area veterans randomly assigned to one of three groups. Some learned to meditate. Others got exposure therapy. The third group attended classes where they learned about nutrition and exercise.\n\nAll sessions were once a week for 90 minutes.\n\nAfter three months, 61 percent of the meditation group improved on a standard PTSD assessment, compared to 42 percent of those who got exposure therapy and 32 percent of those who went to classes. When researchers accounted for other factors, meditation was better than the classes and equally effective as exposure therapy.\n\nThe researchers defined success as at least a 10-point improvement in scores on a standard symptoms test, given to participants by people who did not know which kind of treatment they\u2019d received. The test measures symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia.\n\nPTSD also can be treated with medications or other types of talk therapy. Many of the participants were taking prescribed medicine for PTSD.\n\nMost of the vets were men with combat-related trauma, so it\u2019s not clear whether meditation would be equally effective in women or with other types of trauma.\n\nThere\u2019s growing interest in meditation in the United States. A government survey last year found 14 percent of adults said they had recently meditated, up from 4 percent from a similar survey five years earlier.\n\nThere are many styles of meditation. The type taught to vets in the study was transcendental meditation, or TM, which involves thinking of a mantra or sound to settle the mind.\n\nTM was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a guru to the Beatles in the late 1960s. Some of the study authors are affiliated with a university in Fairfield, Iowa, founded by Maharishi. Their role was to oversee the meditation training.\n\nRutledge, who was the principal researcher, said he does not practice meditation himself.\n\nMeditation could be more acceptable to veterans who might associate mental health treatment with weakness, Rutledge said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably less threatening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be easier to talk to veterans about participating in something like meditation.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Morgan Evans", "title": "Kaley Cuoco's 'Big Bang Theory' behind-the-scenes photo sets off 'depressing' reactions from fans - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Kaley Cuoco's 'Big Bang Theory' behind-the-scenes photo sets off 'depressing' reactions from fans Fox News Kaley Cuoco and her \"Big Bang Theory\" cast are making fans emotional about the show's last season and it's clear the sitcom's devotees aren't e\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kaley-cuocos-big-bang-theory-photo-sparks-depressing-reactions-from-fans", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1280_kaley_cuoco_GettyImages510445048_ren640.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:50:02Z", "content": "Kaley Cuoco and her \"Big Bang Theory\" cast are making fans emotional about the show's last season and it's clear the sitcom's devotees aren't exactly prepared to let the beloved series go.

The two outlets say they have obtained the man's deposition to the U.S. authorities but have decided against publishing the man's name, for his own safety.\n\nThe Insider and Bellingcat, however, did not demonstrate a clear link between the alleged efforts of Russian intelligence to penetrate the visa processing system and Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga, who have been charged with poisoning Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March this year.\n\nThe man also said that FSB officers told him in spring 2016 that they were going to send two people to Britain and asked for his assistance with the visa applications. The timing points to the first reported trip to Britain of the two men, who traveled under the names of Alexander Petrov and Anatoly Boshirov. The man, however, said he told the FSB that there was no way he could influence the decision-making on visa applications.\n\nThe man said he was coerced to sign an agreement to collaborate with the FSB after one of its officers threatened to jail his mother, and was asked to create a \"backdoor\" to the computer network. He said he sabotaged those efforts before he fled Russia in early 2017.\n\nIn September, British intelligence released surveillance images of the agents of Russian military intelligence GRU accused of the March nerve agent attack on double agent Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. Bellingcat and The Insider quickly exposed the agents' real names and the media, including The Associated Press, were able to corroborate their real identities.\n\nThe visa application processing company, TLSContact, and the British Home Office were not immediately available for comment."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Kathleen Joyce", "title": "Hockney\u2019s famous \u2018Portrait of an Artist\u2019 painting is sold for $90.3M, shattering record", "description": "David Hockney\u2019s famous \u201cPortrait of an Artist [Pool with Two Figures]\u201d at Christie\u2019s on Thursday night, easily breaking the record for a work by a living artist sold at auction.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/hockneys-famous-portrait-of-an-artist-painting-is-sold-for-90-3m-shattering-record", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/painting.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:21:20Z", "content": "British artist David Hockney\u2019s famous painting \u201cPortrait of an Artist [Pool with Two Figures]\u201d was sold for $90 million at Christie\u2019s on Thursday night, shattering the record for work by a living artist sold at auction.

The conservatives hold the Asahi newspaper, where Uemura used to work, responsible for spreading the impression that all so-called \"comfort women\" were coerced. Liberals say evidence, including court documents and accounts of the women, shows many people were forced into sexual slavery.\n\nSakurai told a news conference on Friday that she sympathizes with comfort women despite their being \"prostitutes\" but that \"I still think the Asahi and Mr. Uemra should be held accountable\" for hurting Japan's image. She said Japan can't have a unified view of its wartime history because of what she called media bias.\n\nSakurai spearheads the view of Japanese nationalists that comfort women were voluntary prostitutes, and that Japan has been unfairly criticized for a practice they say is common in any country at war. Sakurai, a former newscaster at Nippon Television, is close to the country's powerful conservative political lobby, which includes many lawmakers in Abe's Cabinet and ruling Liberal Democratic Party and backs Abe's campaign for an amendment of Japan's pacifist constitution.\n\nUemura, who currently teaches at a university in South Korea while heading a liberal Japanese magazine, says he is worried about a widening gap in the understanding of wartime history between the two countries. The comfort women and other wartime issues have often strained relations between Tokyo and Seoul, most recently after a South Korean court ruling on Japan's forced mobilization of Korean laborers during the war.\n\nUemura in 2015 filed a defamation suit against Sakurai and three publishers that carried articles by her that alleged his stories were \"fabrication.\" A district court in Sapporo in northern Japan ruled last Friday that Sakurai's articles hurt Uemura's reputation but did not amount to defamation.\n\nUemura wants Sakurai and the magazines to publish an apology and pay 16.5 million yen ($146,000) in compensation. He said he will appeal to a high court. He has also filed other libel suits against a scholar and a publisher in Tokyo.\n\nHistorians say tens of thousands of women, including Japanese, Koreans and others from around Asia were sent to front-line military brothels to provide sex for Japanese soldiers. A 1991-1993 Japanese government investigation concluded many of the women were recruited against their will, leading to a landmark Japanese apology. The investigation found no written proof in official documents, and conservatives have cited that in arguing the women were not coerced.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Dutch protesters planning demos for and against Black Pete", "description": "As Dutch children eagerly anticipate the arrival of their country's version of Santa Claus this weekend, opponents and supporters of his controversial helper Black Pete are gearing up for protests.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/dutch-protesters-planning-demos-for-and-against-black-pete", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-392f2bcb93b74787a9bdf2830f6d0b42.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:29:32Z", "content": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands As Dutch children eagerly anticipate the arrival of their country's version of Santa Claus this weekend, opponents and supporters of his controversial helper Black Pete are gearing up for protests.

The two organizations had collaborated on the project, but disputes over alleged mismanagement at the sanctuary soon arose and six lions have died since arriving there.\n\n\"ADI believes that if we leave our rescued lions at Emoya, they will die before their time,\" Animal Defenders International said Thursday. \"We will move the animals as soon as possible and in accordance with the court order.\"\n\nThe group said it was acting after the \"preventable deaths\" of five lions, including from food poisoning and poaching, and that it was denied immediate access to another lion that died. Animal Defenders International cited \"other problems including misappropriation of funds, materials for the lions and associations with trophy hunters and more.\"\n\nEmoya has denied allegations of wrongdoing and said the South African court ruling against it is based solely on a 90-day termination clause in its contract with Animal Defenders International.\n\n\"The truth is this: Despite unforeseen tragic events, the lions have been and are in excellent condition,\" Emoya said on its website. The lions live in large enclosures \"in the natural Africa habitat,\" receive a venison diet with added supplements and are protected by an upgraded security system, according to Emoya.\n\nWhile Animal Defenders International said it is organizing a \"road trip\" for the lions to another location, Emoya said the move can only happen if it is satisfied with the logistics and the quality of the new home. The judge's order requires coordination between the two groups.\n\nNine of the original 33 lions were surrendered by a circus in Colombia. The remaining 24 were rescued in raids on circuses in Peru as part of a crackdown on wildlife trafficking. The transfer to South Africa had no conservationist value because the animals, which were in poor condition, had been held in captivity and could not live in the wild.\n\n___\n\nFollow Christopher Torchia on Twitter at www.twitter.com/torchiachris"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A look at Americans who have been detained in North Korea", "description": "North Korea says it is expelling American Bruce Byron Lowrance after he slipped unlawfully into the police state known for its anti-U.S. fervor.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/a-look-at-americans-who-have-been-detained-in-north-korea", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-ff708fb2ac7641e6aaca0f886c7b3df8.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T12:27:29Z", "content": "SEOUL, South Korea North Korea says it is expelling American Bruce Byron Lowrance after he slipped unlawfully into the police state known for its anti-U.S. fervor.

Some were driven by religious zeal, others simply were attracted by the mystery of a remote and cloistered country that seems the polar opposite of anything they had experienced.\n\nA look at some of the Americans who have entered North Korea in past decades:\n\n___\n\nBRUCE BYRON LOWRANCE\n\nThe North's official Korean Central News Agency said Lowrance was detained last month after he entered illegally from the border with China. While it said he entered under the \"manipulation\" of the CIA, many detained foreigners have said after their release from North Korea that their declarations of guilt were coerced.\n\nNorth Korea's decision to deport Lowrance after only a month of confinement would be remarkably quick by Pyongyang's standards, apparently reflecting an eagerness to keep alive a positive atmosphere for dialogue with the United States.\n\nWashington and Pyongyang have been engaging in talks on the North's nuclear program since a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in June, when they issued vague aspirational goals for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn November last year, South Korea said a man matching Lowrance's name was caught in an area just south of the Demilitarized Zone without approval. The man later told South Korean investigators that he believed his trip to North Korea would resolve tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over the death of Otto Warmbier, an American university student who died last year days after being released from the North in a coma.\n\nLowrance was arrested in South Korea on the same day a North Korean soldier made a dramatic escape to the South, rushing across the border under a barrage of bullets fired by his former comrades.\n\n___\n\nOTTO WARMBIER\n\nWhile the majority of Americans detained by North Korea have been released in relatively good condition, Warmbier, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, died in June last year shortly after he was flown home comatose after 17 months in captivity.\n\nWarmbier was seized from a tour group while visiting North Korea in January 2016 and convicted on charges of trying to steal a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. North Korea has denied accusations by relatives that it tortured Warmbier and said he was provided \"medical treatments and care with all sincerity.\" The North accused the United States of a smear campaign and called itself the \"biggest victim\" in his death.\n\n___\n\nMATTHEW MILLER\n\nIn September 2014 North Korea sentenced Miller \u2014 then a 24-year-old from Bakersfield, California \u2014 to six years of hard labor on charges he illegally entered the country to commit espionage.\n\nNorth Korea's Supreme Court said Miller tore up his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport upon arrival in April that year and admitted to the \"wild ambition\" of experiencing prison life so that he could secretly investigate North Korea's human rights situation.\n\nMiller was freed in November that year along with another American, Kenneth Bae, a missionary and tour leader.\n\nWeeks before his release, Miller spoke briefly to The Associated Press at a Pyongyang hotel where the North Korean government allowed him to call his family. He said he was digging in fields eight hours a day and being kept in isolation.\n\n___\n\nKENNETH BAE\n\nBae, from Lynnwood, Washington, was detained in November 2012 while leading a tour group in North Korea. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for \"hostile acts\" after being accused of smuggling in inflammatory literature and trying to establish a base for anti-government activities at a border city hotel.\n\nWhile in detention, he told a pro-North Korea newspaper based in Japan that he felt abandoned. His family said he suffered from chronic health issues, including back pain, diabetes, an enlarged heart and liver problems.\n\nBae went home in November 2014 after a secret mission by the U.S. intelligence chief at the time, James Clapper, secured his release, as well as that of Miller. A month earlier, North Korea released another U.S. citizen, Jeffrey Fowle, after detaining him for six months for leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the city of Chongjin.\n\nNorth Korea officially guarantees freedom of religion, but analysts and defectors describe the country as militantly anti-religious. The distribution of Bibles and secret prayer services can mean imprisonment or execution, defectors say.\n\nIn 2009, American missionary Robert Park walked into North Korea with a Bible in his hand to draw attention to North Korea's human rights abuses and to call for the resignation of then leader Kim Jong Il. Park, who was deported from the country in February 2010, has said he was tortured by interrogators.\n\n___\n\nCHARLES JENKINS\n\nCharles Jenkins of North Carolina was one of a handful of U.S. soldiers who fled to North Korea during the Cold War and later appeared in North Korean propaganda films.\n\nJenkins deserted his army post in South Korea in 1965 and fled across the DMZ. In 1980, he married 21-year-old Hitomi Soga, a Japanese nursing student who had been abducted by North Korean agents in 1978.\n\nSoga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002. That was two years before Jenkins was allowed to leave North Korea for Japan, where he surrendered to U.S. military authorities to faced charges that he abandoned his unit and defected to North Korea. He died in Japan in 2017.\n\n__\n\nEVAN HUNZIKER\n\nEvan Hunziker had reportedly been drinking with a friend in 1996 when he decided to swim naked across the Yalu River between China and North Korea.

Recently, Conagra Brands recalled 2.4 million boxes of Duncan Hines cake mix because of a link to salmonella.\n\nThe CDC estimates salmonella causes about 1.2 million illnesses a year. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps and can last up to seven days.

And all those around him as well.\n\nThey are also blinded by their hatred of all things Trump so much so that they have hitched their political wagons to a cast of radical unsavory characters that looks like a reunion of the suicide squad. Enter Michael Avenatti. A two-bit tax cheat and celebrity attorney reborn as a crusading lawyer to porn star Trump accuser Stormy Daniels. Remember this statement?\n\n\u201cThe president trusted Mr. Cohen as his fixer for years. He trusted him with his innermost secrets and I think that the chickens are about to come home to roost.\u201d\n\nThey are coming home to roost, all right, as a battering ram against Donald Trump and later his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Avenatti was elevated by the left.\n\nThe media couldn't get enough of Avenatti. He went from huckster, hard-charging plaintiff's lawyer to a nationwide brand.\n\nHis face was suddenly plastered all over TV and the rest of the media. This profile from Vanity Fair is my personal favorite. How about this quote: \u201cThere he is, the race car driving lawyer with a shaved head and well-defined cheekbones who launched a thousand heart-eye emojis.\u201d\n\nOb my, I don't think I can continue reading this! Now the piece goes on to address some pretty salacious rumors about his tan. \u201cI don't fake bake,\u201d he said. -- He does moisturize twice a day, but shuns complicated skincare products such as eye creams and 40-minute masks.\n\nWell, at one point last spring Avenatti was getting 100 to 125 interview requests a day.\n\nHe was soon a featured guest at glittery events as well, like MTV's video music awards. Maybe they confused him with the rapper Pitbull?\n\nThe political and entertainment media, they just worked overtime to showcase all things Avenatti. What he is doing on TV, that is his business and the people who put him on. For example on CNN.\n\nCuriously neither CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo nor Don Lemon covered Avenatti's arrest Wednesday night by the LAPD on domestic abuse charges. Huh, wonder why? Wednesday night Anderson Cooper did cover Michael Avenatti's post-prison press conference but it was so quick. It was a drive-by mention. It\u2019s like he was saying, \"can we move on to the next topic now? Please? Go, go, go!\"\n\nWell, from Weinstein to Sharpton to Farrakhan and now to Avenatti, the Democrats have a pattern, don't they, of aligning themselves with seedy figures -- even if it means betraying the Democrats\u2019 espoused values that would have actually advanced their cause.\n\nThe Democrats are more than happy to sell out basic principles of decency and fairness in their efforts to take down Trump and frankly anyone connected to him.\n\nAt least Avenatti was forthright in his intentions when he said this over the summer:\n\n\u201cI believe that our Party, the Democratic Party, must be a Party that fights fire with fire. So I say when they go low, we hit harder.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats should've seen the Avenatti flameout coming a mile away. A guy who tried to cheat his law partner, in a million in fees, a guy who is evicted from his own offices, who is willing to cast his lot with a sad figure like Stormy Daniels. A guy who stooped even lower to peddle Julie Swetnick's false and frankly defamatory claims against Kavanaugh.\n\nAvenatti was an arrest waiting to happen. In fact, last month Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley made a criminal referral to both Avenatti and Julie Swetnick for making false statements to Congress.\n\nAnd this was some guy that the left seriously considered as a presidential contender for 2020? For months, a Clinton alum has been shuttling the lawyer Avenatti from Democratic Party event to Democratic Party event all over the country in order to familiarize Avenatti with the whole process of running for the presidency.\n\nAnd the Vermont Democratic Party actually canceled Avenatti's appearance this weekend following his arrest.\n\nWell, in a twist of fate, the man who urged us to believe the women making wild decades-old allegations against Kavanaugh now has a change of perspective. Here\u2019s what he said this week:\n\n\u201cI have never struck a woman. I never will strike a woman. I have been an advocate for women's rights my entire career and I'm going to continue to be an advocate. I'm not going to be intimidated from stopping what I'm doing. \u201c\n\nI have a question. Can you advocate for women's rights behind bars? I guess they do have desks set up in prison.\n\nHow will Democrats and liberal women who embraced this would be Trump slayer react now to this? \u2013\n\nOf course, he is innocent until proven guilty. I said that last night. -- But will CNN give even a fraction of the airtime to his accuser as they did to his clients?

The verdict was fair enough for me and other Cambodian victims,\" he said. \"Last night, I could not sleep because I was afraid that Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan could die before this verdict was announced.\"\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van to the courthouse from the nearby prison where they are held. The prison and the courthouse were custom built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.\n\nNuon Chea, who suffers heart problems, was allowed to move from the hearing room to a separate holding room. Khieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nLawyers for Nuon Chea said they would appeal, and Khieu Samphan was expected to do the same.\n\nIn addition to the two, the tribunal in 2010 convicted Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia's long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further case to go forward, claiming they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted by a Vietnamese invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid court in which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to have more extensive proceeding has discomfited some observers, but others point to the tribunal's accomplishments.\n\n\"International tribunals are better than the alternative, impunity. They will always be political and fall short of expectations,\" Alexander Hinton, an anthropology professor at Rutgers University and author of two books about the tribunal, said ahead of Friday's verdicts. \"But justice is usually delivered, even if at times, as has been the case with the ECCC, it staggers across the finish line.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Amy Lieu", "title": "Woman refuses to hold escalator handrail, case to be heard in Supreme Court of Canada", "description": "The Supreme Court of Canada agreed on Thursday to hear a case of a woman arrested and ticketed for refusing to hold an escalator handrail at a subway station.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/case-of-woman-refusing-to-hold-escalator-handrail-will-be-heard-in-supreme-court-of-canada-reports-say", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/34547_medium.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:16:54Z", "content": "The Supreme Court of Canada On Thursday agreed to hear the case of a woman who was arrested and ticketed back in 2009 for refusing to hold an escalator handrail at a subway station.

Last year, American university student Otto Warmbier died days after he was released in a coma from North Korea after 17 months in captivity.\n\nOn Friday, the Korean Central News Agency said American national Bruce Byron Lowrance was detained on Oct. 16 for illegally entering the country from China. It said he told investigators that he was under the \"manipulation\" of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. It was not clear if the North's spelling of the man's name was correct, and past reports from Pyongyang have contained incorrect spellings.\n\nA short KCNA dispatch said North Korea decided to deport him but did not say why and when.\n\nThe North's decision matches its general push for engagement and diplomacy with the United States this year after a string of weapons tests in 2017, and a furious U.S. response, had some fearing war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn May, North Korea released three American detainees in a goodwill gesture weeks ahead of leader Kim Jong Un's June 12 summit with President Donald Trump in Singapore. The three Americans returned home on a flight with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Weeks after the summit, North Korea returned the remains of dozens of presumed U.S. soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nThe United States, South Korea and others have previously accused North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions.\n\nSome foreigners have said after their release that their declarations of guilt had been coerced while in North Korean custody. Warmbier and other previous American detainees in the North were imprisoned over a variety of alleged crimes, including subversion, anti-state activities and spying.\n\nEarlier Friday, KCNA said Kim observed the successful test of an unspecified \"newly developed ultramodern tactical weapon,\" though it didn't describe what the weapon was.\n\nIt didn't appear to be a test of a nuclear device or a long-range missile with the potential to target the United States. A string of such tests last year pushed always uncomfortable ties on the peninsula to unusually high tension before the North turned to engagement and diplomacy.\n\nStill, any mention of weapons testing could influence the direction of stalled diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Washington and aimed at ridding the North of its nuclear weapons.\n\nExperts say the weapon test was likely an expression of anger by North Korea at U.S.-led international sanctions and ongoing small-scale military drills between South Korea and the United States. It's the first publicly known field inspection of a weapons test by Kim since he observed the testing of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile in November of last year, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry.\n\n\"It's North Korea-style coercive diplomacy. North Korea is saying 'If you don't listen to us, you will face political burdens,'\" said analyst Shin Beomchul of Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea's Foreign Ministry warned it could bring back its policy of bolstering its nuclear arsenal if it doesn't receive sanctions relief.\n\nShin said the weapon North Korea tested could be a missile, artillery, an anti-air gun, a drone or other high-tech conventional weapons systems. Yang Wook, a Seoul-based military expert, said a \"tactical weapon\" in North Korea refers to \"a weapon aimed at striking South Korea including U.S. military bases\" there, so the North may have tested a short-range missile or a multiple rocket launch system.\n\nDiplomacy has stalled since the Singapore summit, with Washington pushing for more action on nuclear disarmament and the North insisting that the U.S. first approve a peace declaration formally ending the Korean War and lift sanctions.\n\nBut Friday's report from the North was noticeably less belligerent than past announcements of weapons tests, and didn't focus on North Korean claims of U.S. and South Korean hostility. Yang said the latest North Korean test won't completely break down nuclear diplomacy, though more questions would be raised about how sincere the North is about its commitment to denuclearization.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, attending a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore, cited the \"great progress\" made on North Korea but said more had to be done.\n\nA year and a half ago, \"nuclear tests were taking place, missiles were flying over Japan and there were threats and propagations against our nation and nations in the region,\" Pence said. \"Today, no more missiles are flying, no more nuclear tests, our hostages have come home, and North Korea has begun anew to return fallen American heroes from the Korean War to our soil. We made great progress but there's more work to be done.\"\n\nPence stressed that U.N. sanctions had to remain enforced.\n\nThe North said the test took place at the Academy of National Defense Science and that Kim couldn't suppress his \"passionate joy\" at its success.

And I think it might have had something to do with my first daughter having just been born. She broke into my heart like nobody else could and what came tumbling out of my mouth without thought was, \u2018I don\u2019t have to be proud of him. I just have to love him and forgive him.\u2019 I was with [my brother Jim] at the time and his mouth was agape when I said it.\n\n\u201cBut I knew when those words came out of my mouth that they were true. I didn\u2019t know how they were true, I didn\u2019t know how I would do it, and it took me years to get there. And I don\u2019t use the word forgive because who the hell am I to forgive anybody?\u201d\n\nOn the day of the massacre, the San Francisco Gate previously reported, the brothers were in Georgetown, 150 miles away from Jonestown, for a basketball tournament.\n\nJim received a phone call from Jones, ordering the Temple members in the Georgetown compound to commit \"revolutionary suicide.\" After pleading with his father, Jim and his teammates rushed to the U.S. Embassy, hoping they could get authorities to stop the horrific slaughter. However, no one at the embassy would open the doors.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be until the following day when Guyanese troops were sent to Jonestown and discovered the carnage. Jim\u2019s pregnant wife was among the dead and at least 300 of the victims were children. Jones, who was 47, was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head. Their mother had died too.\n\nBefore the deadly ritual, Congressman Leo Ryan and several newsmen had come to investigate the remote settlement, only to be assassinated by Jones\u2019 followers.\n\nJim shared he felt a duty to attend the ongoing funerals.\n\n\u201cI remember being at one funeral,\u201d he recalled. \u201c\u2026 I remember one mother pulling out a gun and pointing it at me and saying, \u2018Why should you be alive if my daughter\u2019s not.\u2019 And I remember looking at her going, \u2018I lost everything. Losing my life is not going to be anything different.'\u201d\n\nJones, a charismatic preacher, first opened the People\u2019s Temple in the mid-1950s in Indianapolis. By the early \u201870s, Jones and his family relocated their headquarters to San Francisco where his popularity grew. Jones\u2019 message of social justice and a racially integrated congregation attracted a diverse group of followers, many of them African-American.\n\nStephan said that growing up, he did learn some positive lessons from his father.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of good in my father,\u201d he explained. \u201cI mean, people were attracted to him for a good reason. I think he was sick from a very early age, but he tapped into something very real\u2026 So my father, more than anyone, taught me that it was OK for a man to be vulnerable, for a man to show affection, for a man to show emotion. Those are gifts that I\u2019ll cherish always. My father preached tolerance. He preached a lot of truths. He didn\u2019t live them, but he preached them. And he put us in an environment where we could live them.\u201d\n\nAs a child, Jim felt proud to be a member of the Jones family, one that, at the time, was determined to make a difference in the world.\n\n\u201cI had the best brothers and sisters I could ever have,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, we fought like brothers and sisters, but the closeness and solidarity between us was better than any bond, because it wasn\u2019t blood. It was a bond of commitment that we were a family\u2026 I felt loved. I felt really truly loved.\u201d\n\nBut by the \u201870s, news media were beginning to investigate claims made by ex-members of abuse and tyranny within People\u2019s Temple. It reportedly prompted Jones to summon his followers to the promised land of Jonestown where utopia seemingly awaited them.\n\nThe brothers shared they witnessed their father become increasingly addicted to pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\u201cI knew drugs were a problem with my father,\u201d said Stephan. \u201cIn Jonestown, he [would] come on the loudspeaker and his speech was slurred. It was obvious to everyone that he was on something\u2026 I watched him\u2026 get shot up with something. He said it was B12 and I know that was not B12. He could barely speak to me after that happened. But dad\u2026 was using drugs to wake up and using drugs to go to sleep and feel better about himself for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe men have been haunted by the deaths of those who perished in Jonestown. Today they have found new lives as hands-on parents, which encouraged them to overcome survivor\u2019s guilt over the years. They\u2019re thankful to be alive for their children.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get better,\u201d said Stephan. \u201cAnd when I was ready to do the work that was necessary for that to happen, people showed up in my life and helped me do that\u2026 No one has done that better than my daughters. They are so tuned into me and they\u2019re so sensitive to me. When I am going dark, they call me on it immediately and I\u2019m grateful\u2026 Life is good now, but it wasn\u2019t for many years.\u201d\n\nJim said he hopes the documentary will encourage viewers to not only remember the dead, but also those who made it through. The former members who could never forget their terrifying past, yet are willing to openly share the lessons that can be learned from it.\n\n\u201cI want to recognize the survivors,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to revise the truth, I want to state the truth. These people didn\u2019t commit revolutionary suicide. What they did was they got up for 40 years every day and lived.\u201d\n\n\"Jonestown: Terror in the Jungle\" airs Nov. 17 at 9 p.m. on SundanceTV."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Stephanie Nolasco", "title": "Sharon Tate's sister explains why she's giving away star's iconic wedding dress: 'It's hard to let go' - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Sharon Tate's sister explains why she's giving away star's iconic wedding dress: 'It's hard to let go' Fox News Nearly 50 years after Hollywood star Sharon Tate passed away, her younger sister Debra Tate is letting go.

Some of the items from Tate\u2019s estate include the silk mini wedding dress she wore for her marriage to director Roman Polanski, personal photos, jewelry and more.\n\nTate, who starred in the 1967 film \u201cValley of the Dolls,\u201d was the toast of the swinging \u201860s social scene. The actress was just 26 and nearly nine months pregnant with her first child when she was brutally killed in her Los Angeles home by the notorious Charles Manson cult in 1969.\n\nDebra told Fox News that while she was initially hesitant to participate in the auction, she now feels ready to share her beloved sister with the world.\n\n\u201cIt was time for me to share this stuff that the family had been guarding and hanging on for all these years with the public,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt was hanging in her closet at the time of her death\u2026 This stuff is at least 50 years old. And I\u2019ve got everything. So it\u2019s a massive collection. And that gets hard for one person to care for. I would rather it go to other people who can appreciate it and share Sharon\u2019s fashion legacy and her home style, just as much as I have, as my mother and family have. With proper care, these pieces should last about at least another 50 years.\u201d\n\nDebra admitted that while she will most likely shed some tears during the auction, she has no regrets about her decision.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to let go,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is just stuff. It\u2019s not her spirit. It\u2019s not her memories. I will have those things forever. And of course, I have kept a few pieces for myself. A few special items, but nobody can ever take her away from me.\u201d\n\nDebra, who is in charge of Tate\u2019s estate, also felt compelled to reach out to Polanski about the auction.\n\n\u201cRoman and I are very good friends,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd when I thought that I was going to do this, even though he gave all of Sharon\u2019s belongings to me, as well as her intellectual licensing, it was a courtesy call. I would never do something like this without forewarning him. She was a part of his life. A huge part of his life. And quite a painful chapter in his life.\u201d\n\nThe auction isn\u2019t just bittersweet for the widower. Debra described the relationship she shared with Tate as magical, one that resulted in a lifetime of memories she still cherishes today.\n\n\u201cSharon was a special human being,\u201d Debra explained. \u201cShe was 10 years older than me, which meant there was no sibling rivalry involved. She was so loving and nurturing. People actually thought Sharon was my mother because she looked very mature at age 16 and she\u2019s always leading this 5-year-old by the hand. I was like her personal American Girl doll at 10 years old.\n\n\u201cWe continued to have a very strong bond as I got older. Her friends were my friends. I socialized in her social circle\u2026 I have memories of us walking down Melrose and playing dress-up\u2026 We made each other complete.\u201d\n\nEven as Sharon\u2019s career blossomed in Hollywood, Debra insisted she was there for her to provide much-needed sisterly advice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very critical of myself,\u201d she explained. \"I\u2019ve always been. As a child, my mother would tell me over and over again, \u2018Debra, you\u2019re your own worst enemy. I was always very critical and hard on myself. But Sharon was always telling me not to sweat the little stuff. She was really loving and nurturing of who I was. She would tell me that I was extremely bright and talented and that I could do anything in the world that I put my mind to.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Sharon was sought after by both filmmakers and photographers for her head-turning beauty. But Debra said Tate was more interested in captivating audiences with her talent.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t take herself seriously at all,\u201d said Debra. \u201c[But]\u2026 she took her craft very seriously. She worked hard to develop the craft. She knew that was her persona, but she also knew that\u2019s not who she was. What was important to her was maintaining her heart, her spirit and all of the things that made Sharon. She just wanted to be herself.\n\n\u201cAnd she had a fantastic sense of humor,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the most important thing in life to her was the ability to make people laugh, and laughing at herself. We did that a lot.\u201d\n\nThe auction may give fans a chance to own one of Tate\u2019s personal mementos, but Debra hopes it will celebrate her brief life, as well as the accomplishments she made in Hollywood during her reign.\n\n\u201cShe had a work ethic that was unbelievable,\u201d said Debra. \u201cHere was a woman who had the confidence to go after her dreams. I want to keep her alive\u2026 I want people to remember her for what she could have done had she lived.\u201d\n\nAs for Debra, she has no plans to slow down her work in protecting Tate\u2019s legacy. In July of this year, Debra told People magazine she was supporting Quentin Tarantino\u2019s upcoming movie \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as former Western TV star Rick Dalton, and Brad Pitt as his longtime stunt double Cliff Booth. It explores how both men befriended their next-door neighbor, who happens to be Tate.\n\nIn March, Debra confirmed she was also supporting a film titled \u201cTate,\u201d which features actress Kate Bosworth as her sister. Debra explained she approved the film because \u201cit has nothing to do with Sharon\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nIn February, Debra slammed former child star Hillary Duff after the actress shared a photo of herself dressed as Tate and claiming she is starring in a new film titled \u201cThe Haunting of Sharon Tate.\u201d Soon after, Debra told People she thought Duff\u2019s film was \u201cclassless\u201d and \u201cexploitative.\u201d\n\nSince Tate\u2019s death, Debra has also devoted much of her life to counseling victims of violent crimes. She said there are lessons that can still be learned from Tate.\n\n\u201cAmericans have a knack at not observing their history,\u201d she explained. \u201cHistory is secular. It comes back around again. And currently in the world, especially here in the United States, we are seeing things come back around again. And they are not necessarily all good. So I try to be the voice of reason.\n\n\"Really the only thing that counts is love, not hate\u2026 We have far too many killings, shootings, hate crimes\u2026 It\u2019s all coming back around again. Sharon\u2019s legacy must be realized because she\u2019s an example of what the worst can come from things like this.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Fox News", "title": "FOX NEWS FIRST: Hand recount ordered in Florida as accusations fly; WikiLeaks founder Assange could be charged... - Fox News", "description": "Fox News FOX NEWS FIRST: Hand recount ordered in Florida as accusations fly; WikiLeaks founder Assange could be charged...

Rick Scott and incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson separated by less than 13,000 votes ... Under Florida state law, a manual recount is required if the margin of victory between the candidates is less than 0.25 percent. But the manual recount does not come without controversy. All eyes are once again locked on Broward County and its troubled supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes.\n\nAn official said her county had uploaded the results of its recount two minutes after the state\u2019s 3 p.m. ET deadline \u2013 making its machine recount tally void. Instead, Broward County's results from last Tuesday\u2019s election will stand until manual recount totals come in Sunday at noon.\n\nGOP Senate candidate Rick Scott's campaign charged Snipes intentionally submitted late results so that they would be invalidated. In the recount, Nelson lost more votes than Scott -- meaning Scott would have seen a net gain of 779 votes if Snipes hadn't been late. Thursday\u2019s mistake in Broward is just the latest in a series of missteps for the largely Democratic county. - Reported by Barnini Chakraborty (@Barnini on Twitter) and Gregg Re (@gregg_re on Twitter)\n\nVoting lawsuits piling up after Florida midterms\n\nTRUMP TO VISIT CALIFORNIA - President Trump is expected to travel to California over the weekend amid the wildfires that have ravaged both ends of the state, the White House revealed ...

The Camp Fire burning in Northern California has killed at least 63 people, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said Thursday night; 631 people were unaccounted for. The blaze, which is 40 percent contained, has burned through 140,000 acres and destroyed more than 8,700 homes since it erupted Nov. 8, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. - Reported by Elizabeth Zwirz\n\nDOJ READY TO CHARGE ASSANGE? - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is reportedly facing the prospect of prosecution by the U.S. Justice Department ... A variety of potential charges have been talked about recently among U.S. prosecutors, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing sources familiar with the details. And while those potential charges have yet to be determined, it\u2019s possible that they could include the Espionage Act, the Journal reported. The Washington Post reported Thursday that Assange has already been charged and that prosecutors inadvertently revealed the development in an unsealed court filing.\n\nWhy is this important? - Russia Special Counsel Robert Mueller is believed to be close to ending his investigation. WikiLeaks is facing a federal grand jury investigation over its publication of American diplomatic and military secrets stemming from the war in Iraq.

It was also another chance for Japan and Australia to present a united front as regional partners in the Asia-Pacific amid ongoing concerns of spreading Chinese influence, including the country's building of islands in the disputed South China Sea.\n\n\"Australia and Japan also stand united on the importance of resolving disputes in the South China Sea, peacefully and in accordance with international law, and we are strongly opposed to any actions that could increase tensions within the region,\" Morrison said., reading from a prepared statement after meeting Abe.\n\nHe added that a \"stable and secure regional maritime ... order is central to both Australia and Japan's visions for the region, and is underpinned by respect for international law.\"\n\nMorrison also said he looked forward to increased cooperation with Japan to support regional maritime safety and security. The leaders said they hope to conclude early next year an agreement on increased defense links, including more joint military exercises.\n\nAbe said Japan and Australian would promote cooperation to strengthen the rule of law at sea. They also agreed to promote cooperation in providing building assistance for maritime security-related projects in Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations.\n\nThe two leaders reiterated their commitment to the denuclearization of North Korea, while Abe also praised Australia's role in a revamped Pacific Rim free-trade agreement that President Donald Trump had pulled the U.S. out of. It comes into effect later this year.\n\n\"Darwin, connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans, is a crucial place for the stability and prosperity of the whole of the Indo-Pacific,\" Abe said. \"It is at this very place where Prime Minister Morrison and I confirmed our commitment to further deepen this special strategic partnership between Japan and Australia, in pursuit of our common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nAbe arrived for his visit Friday afternoon and immediately went to lay a wreath with Morrison at the city's main war memorial.

The government is not required to pay for an immigration court lawyer.\n\nCalifornia has been providing attorney's to immigrants before Trump's election, but other SAFE members had not done so until the formation of the network, said network director Annie Chen.\n\nLast year, Seattle passed a measure to put $1 million toward legal defense for immigrants and refugees. The money will be administered by community groups.\n\nCity leaders in Santa Ana, Calif., directed $65,000 last year toward its newly created legal defense fund and New York created the first statewide immigrant defense fund.\n\nWhile immigration advocates have praised the initiatives, those who prefer stricter immigration laws have criticized them.\n\n\u201cIt is simply bad public policy to be spending public funds at a time when everyone is strapped for cash and cannot fund the money for vital services,\" said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), in an interview last year. \"Even if they are relatively small funders, they are directing much-needed resources from schools and roads to meet the political desires of lawmakers.\"\n\n\u201cIt is simply bad public policy to be spending public funds at a time when everyone is strapped for cash and cannot fund the money for vital services.\" \u2014 Ira Mehlman, spokesman, Federation for American Immigration Reform\n\nSome cities have faced opposition over its attempts to create similar programs.\n\nA 2015 study published in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review reported that detained immigrants with access to legal counsel were 10 times more likely to be granted legal residency than those without.\n\nIn a statement just after his city approved financial support for legal representation to immigrants, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh said it was a matter of safety.\n\n\u201cProviding legal representation to those facing deportation maintains trust in law enforcement and our local institutions and keeps us all safe,\" Pugh said. \"If our residents don\u2019t feel safe \u2013 for example, coming forward to report crimes and cooperating with law enforcement \u2013 all of us are at more risk.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Turkish police detain 12 academics, activists in raids", "description": "Police in Istanbul detained 12 academics, businesspeople and journalists as part of an investigation into an association that was headed by a jailed prominent businessman and activist, Turkey's state-run news agency reported Friday.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkish-police-detain-12-academics-activists-in-raids", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T09:07:17Z", "content": "ANKARA, Turkey Police in Istanbul detained 12 academics, businesspeople and journalists as part of an investigation into an association that was headed by a jailed prominent businessman and activist, Turkey's state-run news agency reported Friday.

It's part attempt to clean up the coastal city of 300,000 as world leaders briefly descend on it for a Pacific Rim summit this weekend and part the latest episode of an ongoing struggle to control betel nut after previous attempts to completely ban it in the city caused chaos.\n\nPrime Minister Peter O'Neill wants Papua New Guinea, one of the least urbanized countries in the world, to present its best face for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. Faces with red lips and stained teeth are not part of that vision.\n\nAt the Koki Buai market, more than two dozen vendors laid out mounds of the green betel palm fruit and small piles of mustard beans as an excited crowd was kept under control by threats and admonishments from heavies, some wielding bits of wood, employed to keep order.\n\n\"I'm happy that APEC has come to PNG and I'm happy the leaders are here, everyone from other countries,\" said vendor Rodney Pupu. \"I want to welcome all of you.\"\n\nThe market is one of several set up in Port Moresby over the past several years as a compromise that allows the trade in \"green gold\" to continue.\n\nChewing betel nut has deep cultural roots in Papua New Guinea's tribal societies but in the capital has morphed into addiction and lucrative business. Medical experts says prolonged use causes oral cancer.\n\nA total ban imposed in Port Moresby in 2013 spiraled into conflict that caused deaths and property damage and deprived thousands of people of livelihoods, development economist Busa Jeremiah Wenogo wrote in a blog. Another total ban was threatened earlier this year but was wound back after tear gas fired by police to disperse vendors drifted into a school, Wenogo said. There were also allegations police stripped vendors naked as a form of punishment.\n\nThe current solution \u2014 designated markets \u2014 also has its problems because of cramped conditions and confrontations between rival factions, he said.\n\nAt Koki Buai, handfuls of the fruit were selling for 2-5 kina (60 cents to $3) and mustard beans for 1-2 kina. Pupu said he can make 1,000 kina ($300) in a week and double that if a rugby match \u2014 a national obsession \u2014 is happening in the town.\n\nBefore the market, which some of the vendors credited the minister for APEC Justin Tkatchenko with setting up, Pupu said selling was a cat-and-mouse game with police.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the high cost of hosting the summit and controversies such as the import of 40 luxury Maserati cars to transport VIPs, Pupu deferred to the market's boss, a feisty woman hovering nearby.\n\nAnother man, John Simage, interjected.\n\n\"I strongly disagree that the government decided to take so much money and buy the Maseratis when we actually have cars in Papua New Guinea that we could use to transport delegates,\" he said. \"We could have saved that money to bring further development to the country.\"\n\nWhat's been called Papua New Guinea's global coming-out party has caused both pride and discord and underlined the yawning gulf between a small well-educated minority and the poor, who include the 85 percent of people living in the highlands and other remote areas.\n\nCity social services worker Tony Sari said the country needs development but also acknowledged that the summit expenses were unpopular outside the capital, where basic public services such as health and education are limited.\n\n\"It's like living. You have good days and bad days,\" he said, weighing up the pros and cons.\n\nIt was clear, Sari said, that the overhaul of Port Moresby has made an impact.\n\nWhen he travels in his National Capital District Commission vehicle, people sometimes shout \"APEC! APEC!\" he said, amused to find himself getting credit.\n\nAt a busy supermarket, 21-year-old groceries bagger Catherine Lapsie said she was \"really happy\" her small country is getting attention.\n\nThe restrictions on public drinking and betel nut chewing could change behavior for the better, she said, but was also afraid of what might happen once the foreign dignitaries leave.\n\n\"I feel something terrible will happen,\" she said. \"They said after the APEC meeting, something will go on,\" Lapsie said, grimacing while trying to explain her fears in English.\n\nSwitching to a local language, she explained that more tourists might come and prices increase, making life more difficult for ordinary Papua New Guineans."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Dom Calicchio", "title": "Jennie-O turkey products recalled amid salmonella outbreak", "description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday said it was issuing a recall for more than 91,000 pounds of turkey products made by a Wisconsin company.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/jennie-o-turkey-products-recalled-amid-broader-salmonella-outbreak", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/iStock-858181156.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T08:48:28Z", "content": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday said it was issuing a recall for more than 91,000 pounds of turkey products made by a Wisconsin company.

Recently, Conagra Brands recalled 2.4 million boxes of Duncan Hines cake mix because of a link to salmonella.\n\nThe CDC estimates salmonella causes about 1.2 million illnesses a year. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps and can last up to seven days.

(Does this mean there won\u2019t be a face-to-face interview? Who knows?)\n\nWhat I'm hearing from the White House is that the president is simply sick of the long-running investigation and, after conferring with his lawyers, wants to bring it to a head.\n\nTrump has made his \"witch hunt\" allegations for much of the Mueller probe.And by the way, it\u2019s hardly unprecedented to try to investigate those who are investigating you. Bill Clinton and his allies mounted a sustained campaign to demonize Ken Starr.\n\nBut Trump's attacks yesterday may be his harshest yet.\n\n\"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess,\" Trump tweeted. \"They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want.\n\n\"They are a disgrace to our Nation and don't care how many lives the [sic] ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\"\n\nThe all-caps was just for emphasis.\n\nThe president can certainly argue that Mueller, even with his charges against Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn and others, has come up with no evidence of collusion with Russia.\n\nBut keep in mind that it was Trump's own appointee, Rod Rosenstein, who named Mueller as special counsel, and the deputy attorney general says he's doing a good job.\n\nWhat's more, it was George W. Bush who tapped Mueller as FBI director. Obama just let him finish out his 10-year term, and tacked on an additional two years. So to suggest that Mueller is some kind of Obama loyalist is just wrong.\n\nOne aspect that the pundits are focusing on is that the latest attack on Mueller comes after the president replaced Jeff Sessions with Matt Whitaker, who has a history of criticizing the special counsel. But whether the acting attorney general will take any steps to curtail the probe remains to be seen.\n\nBy outward appearances, Mueller seems to be down to third-level players. The Wall Street Journal reports that he is investigating whether veteran GOP operative Roger Stone tried to intimidate a witness who is contradicting his insistence he had no pipeline to WikiLeaks on the hacked Democratic emails. In emails to his former friend, Randy Credico, the Journal says, Stone threatened to \"sue the f---\" out of him and called Credico \"a loser a liar and a rat.\" But this is pretty small potatoes.\n\nThe president also weighed in on the press yesterday, as he is wont to do. I reported yesterday on a spate of stories (The Washington Post, L.A. Times, Politico) about how Trump has been angry, furious and lashing out since the midterms as he mulls another White House shakeup.\n\nInsiders tell me that many of the leaks likely emanate from places such as the Homeland Security Department and National Security Council, where people's jobs are threatened (such as Kirstjen Nielsen and deputy NSC director Mira Ricardel, who's being transferred after Melania Trump called for her firing). The president often discusses job changes with advisers and doesn't mind the rumors that float around and hit the press.\n\nTrump tweeted yesterday: \"The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good. We are the envy of the world. But anytime I even think about making changes, the FAKE NEWS MEDIA goes crazy, always seeking to make us look as bad as possible! Very dishonest!\"\n\nI mean, why would anyone think he's angry?\n\nBut the president does have a point that routine personnel moves after an election are getting the media\u2019s \"chaos\" treatment \u2014 even if \"running very smoothly\" is not the most apt description of this White House."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "'Stranded motorist' in GoFundme case allegedly texted friend, 'shush about the made up stuff': report - Fox News", "description": "Fox News 'Stranded motorist' in GoFundme case allegedly texted friend, 'shush about the made up stuff': report Fox News A New Jersey woman who prosecutors say was part of an elaborate conspiracy to dupe GoFundMe donors of more than $400,000 text messaged a fr\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/woman-of-new-jersey-couple-allegedly-texted-friend-after-gofundme-campaign-launch-saying-shush-about-the-made-up-stuff-report", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Triple-Mugs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T08:14:23Z", "content": "A New Jersey woman who prosecutors say was part of an elaborate conspiracy to dupe GoFundMe donors of more than $400,000 text messaged a friend about the GoFundMe page and said to, \"shush about the made up stuff,\" a prosecutor said Thursday.

A woman dabbed her crying, naked toddler with a moist cloth.\n\nNearly 2,000 caravan migrants had reached the U.S. border in Mexico's northwestern corner by Thursday, with more coming in a steady trickle of buses. The city of Tijuana, with its privately run shelters operating well above their capacity of 700, opened the gymnasium and gated sport complex for up to 1,000 migrants, with a potential to expand to 3,000.\n\nWith U.S. border inspectors processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at the main border crossing with San Diego, prospects grew that migrants would be stuck waiting in Tijuana for months.\n\nFrancisco Rueda, the top deputy to Baja California state Gov. Francisco Vega de la Madrid, said about 1,750 migrants from the caravan had reached Tijuana so far.\n\n\"This is not a crisis,\" he told reporters, though he agreed that \"this is an extraordinary situation.\"\n\nRueda said the state has 7,000 jobs available for its \"Central American migrant brothers\" who obtain legal residence status in Mexico.\n\n\"Today in Baja California there is an employment opportunity for those who request it, but it order for this to happen, it has to regulate migrant status,\" he said.\n\nThe city's thriving factories are always looking for workers, and several thousand Haitian migrants who were turned away at the U.S. border have found jobs and settled in Tijuana the last two years.\n\nPolice made their presence known in a city that is suffering an all-time-high homicide rate. A group of about 50 migrants, mostly women and children, walked through downtown streets Thursday from the city shelter to a breakfast hall under police escort.\n\nAs buses from western and central Mexico trickled in, some families camped inside the bus terminal and waited for word on where they could find a safe place to sleep.\n\nOscar Zapata, 31, reached the Tijuana bus station at 2 a.m. Thursday from Guadalajara with his wife and their three children, ages 4, 5 and 12, and headed to the breakfast hall, where migrants were served free beef and potatoes.\n\nBack home in La Ceiba, Honduras, he sold pirated CDs and DVDs in the street and two gangs demanding \"protection\" money threatened to kidnap his daughter and force her into prostitution if he didn't pay. When he heard about the caravan on the TV news last month, he didn't think twice.\n\n\"It was the opportunity to get out,\" Zapata said.\n\nZapata said he hopes to join a brother in Los Angeles but has not yet decided on his next move. Like many others, he plans to wait in Tijuana for others in the caravan to arrive and gather more information before seeking asylum in the United States.\n\nByron Jose Blandino, a 27-year-old bricklayer from Nicaragua who slept in the converted gymnasium, said he wanted to request asylum but not until he could speak with someone well-versed in U.S. law and asylum procedures.\n\n\"The first thing is to wait,\" Blandino said. \"I do not want to break the laws of any country. If I could enter in a peaceful manner, that would be good.\n\nTo claim asylum in San Diego, migrants enter their names in a tattered notebook held together by duct tape and managed by the migrants in a plaza outside the entry to the main border crossing. On Thursday, migrants who registered six weeks ago were getting their names called. The waiting list has grown to more than 3,000 names and stands to become much longer with the new arrivals.\n\nDozens of gay and transgender migrants in the caravan were already lining up Thursday to submit asylum claims, though it was unclear how soon they would be able to do so.\n\nRueda, the governor's deputy, said that if all migrants from the caravan currently in Tijuana were to register to seek asylum in the U.S., they would likely have to wait four months at current processing rates. For that reason, the state has asked Mexican federal authorities to encourage people in other caravans to go to other border cities.\n\nThere are real questions about how the city of more than 1.6 million will manage to handle the migrant caravans working their way through Mexico, which may total 10,000 people in all.\n\n\"No city in the world is prepared to receive this number of migrants,\" said Mario Osuna, Tijuana's social development director. He said the city hopes Mexico's federal government \"will start legalizing these people immediately\" so they can get jobs and earn a living.\n\nThe caravan has fragmented somewhat in recent days in a final push to the border, with some migrants moving rapidly in buses and others falling behind.\n\nOn Thursday, hundreds were stranded for most of the day at a gas station in Navojoa, some 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) from Tijuana.\n\n\"We were dropped here at midnight ... in the middle of nowhere, where supposedly some buses were going to come pick us up, but nothing,\" Alejandra Grisel Rodriguez of Honduras told The Associated Press by phone. \"We are without water, without food.\"\n\nAfter about 12 hours, seven buses began arriving to collect the migrants, Rodriguez said, but they quickly filled up.\n\n\"We would need at least 40 or 50,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Maria Verza in Culiacan, Mexico, contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Imelda Marcos posts bail for graft conviction in Philippines", "description": "Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos on Friday posted a $7,400 bail for provisional liberty after she was found guilty of graft and ordered imprisoned.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/imelda-marcos-posts-bail-for-graft-conviction-in-philippines", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-f12e154597a7491386f5d4db19ecc386.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T05:10:43Z", "content": "MANILA, Philippines Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos on Friday posted a $7,400 bail for provisional liberty after she was found guilty of graft and ordered imprisoned.

They are already serving life sentences after being convicted in a previous 2011-2014 trial of crimes against humanity connected with forced transfers and disappearances of masses of people.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead their radical policies led to what has been termed 'auto-genocide' through starvation, overwork and execution.\n\nNuon Chea was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van from the nearby prison where they are held. The prison and the courthouse were custom built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.\n\nBoth defendants were present as Judge Nil Nonn opened the proceedings, but Nuon Chea suffers heart problems, so was granted permission to later move from the hearing room to a separate holding room.\n\nNuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are being judged on charges of crimes against humanity, such as murder, extermination, enslavement, torture and persecution on political, racial, and religious grounds; genocide, for the killings of members of the Vietnamese and Cham ethnic groups; and more breaches of the Geneva Conventions, including willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nThe large crowd of spectators attending Friday's session included members of the Cham, a Muslim ethnic minority.\n\nLah Sath, a 72-year-old Cham man from eastern Kampong Cham province, brought his wife and four young granddaughters to Friday's session. He said he often heard people talking about the trial and sometimes watched it on TV, but decided it was time to see it with his own eyes.\n\nJust talking about the Khmer Rouge brought back horrible memories of life under their rule in 1975-79, he said. The Cham were treated as enemies and exploited without mercy as they were forced to do intensive farm labor, he recalled.\n\nLah Sath said his younger brother was killed by Khmer Rouge for failing to take good care of a cow.\n\nIn addition to Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, the tribunal has carried out one other prosecution, resulting in the 2010 conviction of Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia's long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further case to go forward, claiming they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted from power by a Vietnamese invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid courtsin which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to have more extensive proceeding has discomfited some observers, but others point to the tribunals accomplishments\n\n\"International tribunals are better than the alternative, impunity.

How they shake out could play a pivotal role in deciding who the state\u2019s next U.S. senator will be. The still-undecided race pits Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, against Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the lawsuits filed and what they could mean for the recount effort.\n\nSignature mismatch\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party sought to extend the deadline for people to correct ballots with signatures deemed not to match what's on record.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Walker decided Thursday to give some voters until 5 p.m. Saturday to fix their ballots. The Scott campaign is appealing that ruling.\n\nLate in the mail\n\nThis lawsuit also filed by the Democratic Party and the VoteVets Action Fund seeks to validate vote-by-mail ballots that were postmarked before Election Day but received after that. The lawsuit contends voters should not be disenfranchised because of postal service speed.\n\nThe case is pending before Walker.\n\nRecount deadlines\n\nA third Democratic Party lawsuit asked that all counties be given enough time to finish both a machine and a manual recount. The Democrats contend more populated counties will have more difficulty meeting the deadlines and should be allowed time to count every vote.\n\nWalker refused Thursday to extend the deadlines.\n\nWhat did they intend, anyway?\n\nThe Democrats also want to set a new standard for voter intent. Under state law, voters must use only approved markings or their ballot is disqualified, and they can't simply cross out a mistaken vote but must explain in writing why they did so. The lawsuit contends that has a discriminatory impact on non-native English speakers and illiterate voters.\n\nWalker has this case before him, as well.\n\nScott's role, considered\n\nThe League of Women Voters of Florida and Common Cause seek to limit the role Scott can play as governor in administering the election and recount because he has a conflict of interest. Scott's lawyers said at one hearing that he would recuse himself from sitting on the board that certifies final election results. But the lawsuit wants to bar the governor from having any influence over the canvassing process or authority to suspend election supervisors.\n\nThe case is pending before Walker.\n\nDelay in Palm Beach\n\nDemocrat James Bonfiglio, in a recount for a Palm Beach state House seat, wants to make sure Palm Beach County election officials have time to recount his race. A state judge agreed to extend the deadline for all of Palm Beach County, but the case was moved to federal court and remains pending.\n\nPalm Beach manual recount\n\nNelson's campaign filed a lawsuit asking a judge to order a full manual recount of all Palm Beach County votes because equipment failures and other problems resulted in that county's failure to submit a machine recount to the state. The lawsuit asks the judge to order the manual recount to be completed by noon Sunday.\n\nThe case is pending.\n\nUnofficial in Broward\n\nScott's Senate campaign sued Broward County in an effort to prevent elections officials from counting ballots that were valid but that had not been canvassed by the Nov. 10 deadline for the initial unofficial total. A judge sided with the county Thursday.\n\nPublic records\n\nA judge sided with the Scott campaign in another Broward County lawsuit, this one involving Florida's public records laws. Scott's lawyers contended that Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes was violating state law by not complying with their requests for access to a variety of election records. The judge agreed, and Snipes provided the information.\n\nPalm Beach balloting\n\nThis lawsuit by the Scott campaign contended that Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher improperly refused to allow Republican representatives to witness the processing and duplication of ballots that were physically damaged.\n\nA judge ordered that any such ballot that is disqualified should be reviewed by the county canvassing board and Bucher should provide a list of all voters who voted by provisional ballot.\n\nImpounded\n\nScott's campaign also filed lawsuits in Broward and Palm Beach counties seeking to have voting machines impounded by the county sheriff and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement when not in use. In Broward, a judge wouldn't go that far but said extra deputies would be stationed at the elections office to keep watch. In Palm Beach, the lawsuit was defused when\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Mariah Haas", "title": "Carrie Underwood on having another baby boy: 'It was just great news' - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Carrie Underwood on having another baby boy: 'It was just great news' Fox News Carrie Underwood couldn't be more thrilled to be expecting another baby boy.

That\u2019s a right he and many Democrats who have attacked the president and Kavanaugh dismissed as irrelevant when judging allegations against them.\n\nAvenatti has even said he is thinking about seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to run against President Trump, who he regularly denounces with a long list of unproven claims.\n\nAnd Avenatti had no problem trotting out a woman named Julie Swetnick who claimed \u2013 without a shred of evidence \u2013that Kavanaugh spiked the drinks of girls in the early 1980s at high school parties and lined up with other boys waiting to rape the girls.\n\nAt Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing another woman \u2013 Christine Blasey Ford \u2013 testified that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school. Though she presented no evidence, Democrats rushed to praise her and said women must always be believed when accusing men of sexually assaulting them or other sexual misconduct.\n\nThe universe has a funny way of making a point.\n\nThe news that Avenatti is now accused of assaulting a woman can be seen as karmic retribution. After all, Americans watched for weeks as he and like-minded Democratic politicians reveled in trying to convince Americans that a man accused of sexual assault was guilty until proven innocent, and that the burden of proof was on the accused.\n\nSuddenly, Avenatti is a born-again civil libertarian dedicated to preserving the right of those accused of a crime to due process of law.\n\n\u201cBelieve the woman\u201d was to displace due process, which was painted as an archaic, misogynist notion. This most basic concept of justice and fairness was dismissed by Democrats as a needless burden on our system, protecting men who victimized women.\n\nWhat about the notion of demanding evidence before concluding someone is guilty? The Democrats \u2013 including Avenatti \u2013 made the point that taking both the accuser and accused seriously, but not favoring one over the other, was now somehow sexist.\n\nThe good news for Avenatti now is that our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers were not like him. They understood that fairness, due process and the rule of the law are an important bulwark against tyrants. They knew that without the presumption of innocence any one of us could be locked up for years \u2013 even executed \u2013 based on false accusations.\n\nAmazing what a difference an arrest makes in changing a person\u2019s perspective.\n\nAvenatti is now complaining on Twitter about how media reports are wrong, and that the news coverage of him is not fair. He sounds remarkably like the man he loves to hate \u2013 President Trump.\n\nAvenatti tweeted: \u201cThere is a lot of inaccurate reporting out there. \u2026 Numerous other \u2018facts\u2019 being reported are completely bogus.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Avenatti insisted that he will be exonerated. For that to happen, of course, he will be relying on due process and the rule of law. Good for him. He should absolutely rely on the fairness of our legal system, and not be prejudged in a court of law or in the court of public opinion.\n\nAnd both President Trump and Kavanaugh have the same rights as Avenatti.\n\nWe are reminded of this because unsubstantiated allegations were all Avenatti required to convict and condemn Kavanaugh, an innocent man who has dedicated his life to public service and has no wrongdoing on his record.\n\nThe lack of a relationship with fairness and due process regarding his claims about Julie Swetnick has earned Avenatti a referral by the Senate Judiciary Committee for a criminal investigation.\n\n\n\nFor weeks our nation was subjected to Democrats attempting to assassinate the character of Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing. To do so they weaponized sexual violence against women, transforming it from a serious issue into a cudgel with which to frame, punish and destroy an innocent man simply because he may think differently than they do on certain issues.\n\nConservative social media made some important points after the news broke about Avenatti\u2019s arrest. Mark Hemingway tweeted: \u201cWait accusations without proof can be used to unjustly damage someone\u2019s reputation? Avenatti doesn\u2019t have the best grasp of irony does he?\u201d\n\nIt is hard to believe that those who were arguing for the destruction of Justice Kavanagh were unaware of how dangerous their actions were. In fact, it is more likely they knew what they were doing, and simply did not \u2013 and do not \u2013 expect repercussions for themselves.\n\nThe good news is, Americans recognized that kangaroo court for what it was, which no doubt led to the Republicans keeping control of the Senate in the Nov. 6 midterm elections.\n\nUnfortunately, in January the House of Representatives will fall under control of the Democrats who implicitly enabled and encouraged the behavior of people like Avenatti.\n\nIn fact, some House Democrats are even discussing the possibility of impeaching Kavanaugh. There\u2019s no legitimate reason for that. But what does that matter when the ends justify the means?\n\nAvenatti will continue to enjoy due process of law and the presumption of innocence to protect him \u2013 but will no doubt continue to deny it to his political opponents.\n\nBut equal justice under the law must be just that \u2013 equal. There must never be one set of protections for Democrats that can be thrown out the window for Republicans.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a lesson likely not to be learned by Avenatti, but it serves as a reminder that the brilliance of the American system is its fairness \u2013 and it belongs to all of us, all the time."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Elizabeth Zwirz", "title": "Wikileaks founder Julian Assange facing possible prosecution by DOJ: report - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Wikileaks founder Julian Assange facing possible prosecution by DOJ: report Fox News Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is reportedly facing the prospect of prosecution by the U.S. Justice Department.
