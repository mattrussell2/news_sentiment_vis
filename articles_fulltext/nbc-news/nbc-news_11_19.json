Cross Coburn is gay. Cross Coburn is an adult. And \u2014 like many other single, gay adults \u2014 Cross Coburn has shared suggestive selfies on Grindr, the world\u2019s most popular gay dating app.\n\nBut, what sets Coburn\u2019s story apart, is that his suggestive images, which he believed he was sharing privately with a man with whom he was chatting online, set off a chain of events that ended up costing him his job as a councilman in Groves, Texas, a small, conservative, bayou town on the Louisiana border.\n\nCross Coburn Courtesy Cross Coburn\n\n\u201cI do know that elected officials do need to be held to a high standard,\u201d Coburn, 19, told NBC News, but, he added, \u201cthey still deserve a private life.\u201d\n\nCoburn was ousted from office earlier this month in a contentious recall election sparked by the Grindr images, but he has filed a lawsuit challenging the validity of the petition that allowed him to be voted out halfway through his term.\n\nCoburn\u2019s attorney, Jill Swearingen Pierce, said it all started in February of this year when Coburn was first summoned to a meeting by Groves Mayor Brad Bailey. At the meeting, Bailey informed Coburn and Pierce that the city had received an anonymous envelope in the mail that contained \u201csome highly disturbing photographs,\u201d Pierce recalled.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Let me see it,\u2019 so he slides it over, I flip it over, and it\u2019s obviously a private conversation on Grindr,\u201d Pierce said, adding that the screenshots had been edited so the person soliciting Coburn\u2019s images was completely anonymous.\n\nCross Coburn, right, and his mother. Courtesy Cross Coburn\n\nAfter Pierce and Coburn viewed the images, the mayor, according to Pierce, told her client, \u201cYou need to think about your options, but you should probably resign.\u201d\n\nBut Coburn refused to resign. The mayor called him again, Coburn recalled, and said it would be best if he made a decision by the following Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI call him back and ask him, \u2018Mayor, what exactly am I supposed to be making a decision on?\u2019\u201d Coburn told NBC News. \u201cAt this point he snapped.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coburn, Mayor Bailey then said, \u201cNow I\u2019m getting pissed. It\u2019s about time you grow up and take responsibility for your actions, you cannot hide from your past.\u201d\n\nSoon after, a different set of anonymous envelopes containing the same information and images was sent to local news outlets, which published stories about the salacious photos.\n\n\u201cIs this in any way proper behavior of a councilman to represent himself online or a \u2018dating\u2019 app? I felt the city council should be made aware of the situation,\u201d the note accompanying the anonymous envelope stated, according to local outlet Port Arthur News.\n\nPort Arthur News quoted Mayor Bailey as saying, \u201cI would like it to be known that the city is aware of this (photos), the allegations of photos of private areas \u2026 We have met and discussed it with our police department and HR department. It will be an issue.\u201d\n\nCoburn, who alleged he was targeted due to his sexuality, said a recall petition began to circulate over the summer. After the petition was filed, he said \"a man in the hallway outside city council said, 'Good now we can get that faggot out of here.'\"\n\nOn Election Day, Coburn lost his seat in the recall by a vote of 2,071 to 1,138. The seat currently sits vacant.\n\nBut before the election even took place, Coburn and Pierce filed a lawsuit attempting to block the recall petition. They said two people whose names appear on the petition signed affidavits stating they had never signed it.\n\nAccording to the Port Arthur News, the \u201cduly sworn person\u201d handling the pages of the petition where the contested signatures were was \u201cDarla Bailey, wife of Groves Mayor Brad Bailey.\u201d\n\nCoburn said he does not know who could have sent his Grindr images to the town council, but he alleged that Groves Councilman Kyle Hollier forwarded the images on to local news outlets. Hollier would not provide a comment to NBC News regarding Coburn\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cDue to the lawsuit that we are under right now and by the advice of our city attorney, I have no comment,\u201d Hollier stated. Calls to the Bailey residence requesting comment from the mayor and his wife were unanswered.\n\nCoburn and his lawyer allege Bailey and others committed fraud by adding at least two people to the recall petition. If an appeal finds in favor of Coburn, the recall petition could be invalidated, which would restore Coburn to his position on the council.\n\n\u201cThis is my life \u2014 this is what I have decided I want to do,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cI want to dedicate my life to public service and to the public, and I believe this is my place in the wider revolution for our democracy.\u201d\n\nChuck Smith, CEO of LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Texas, said his organization hopes an investigation would \u201cdetermine whether any election laws or municipal ordinances were violated in the actions that led to Cross Coburn\u2019s recall.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is sad that a young man recently elected to public office to serve his home town has effectively been tarred and feathered and removed from office for being gay,\u201d Smith said.\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "How your cat's sandpapery tongue deep-cleans", "description": "The tongues of cats are covered in claw-shaped hooks that spring into action when it's time to groom.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nCat lovers know that when kitties groom, their tongues are pretty scratchy. Using high-tech scans and some other tricks, scientists are learning how those sandpapery tongues help cats get clean and stay cool.\n\nThe secret: Tiny hooks that spring up on the tongue \u2014 with scoops built in to carry saliva deep into all that fur.\n\nA team of mechanical engineers reported the findings Monday, and say they're more than a curiosity. They could lead to inventions for pets and people.\n\n\"Their tongue could help us apply fluids, or clean carpets, or apply medicine\" to hairy skin, said Georgia Institute of Technology lead researcher Alexis Noel, who is seeking a patent for a 3D-printed, tongue-inspired brush.\n\nThis is the surface of a cat's tongue. Rigid, hollow papillae near the tongue tip are shown on the right, while soft, conical papillae near the throat are shown to the left. Alexis Noel / Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nCats are fastidious, spending up to a quarter of their waking hours grooming. Noel's interest was piqued when her cat, Murphy, got his tongue stuck in a fuzzy blanket. Scientists had long thought cat tongues were studded with tiny cone-shaped bumps. Noel, working in a lab known for animal-inspired engineering, wondered why.\n\nFirst, CT scans of cats' tongues showed that they're not covered in solid cones but in claw-shaped hooks. They lie flat and rear-facing, out of the way until, with a twitch of the tongue muscle, the little spines spring straight up, she explained.\n\nThe big surprise: Those spines contain hollow scoops, Noel found. Turning to zoos and taxidermists for preserved tongues to examine, she found that bobcats, cougars, snow leopards, even lions and tigers share that trait.\n\nWhen Noel touched the tips of preserved spines \u2014 called papillae \u2014 with drops of food dye, they wicked up the liquid. A housecat's nearly 300 papillae hold a small amount of saliva that's released when the tongue presses on fur, and then they wick up some more.\n\nThe tongue's surface is wetter. But Noel saw clues that the spines were key to deep cleaning.\n\nPapillae were only slightly longer in lions than in housecats, although larger felines' bigger tongues hold many hundreds more, Noel and Georgia Tech associate Professor David L. Hu reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nNext, Noel measured cat fur, which holds lots of air to insulate like a down jacket. Sure enough, compress that fur and in numerous types of cats, the distance to the skin matches the length of the tongue's spines, she found. An exception: Persian cats with their superlong fur, which veterinarians caution must be brushed daily to avoid matting.\n\nA machine that mimicked the strokes of a cat's grooming found that saliva from the tongue's surface alone simply can't penetrate as deep. And a thermal camera showed that as the cats groomed, evaporating saliva cooled them."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Jonathan Allen", "title": "Democrats seek rule change to formally allow hijabs, yarmulkes on House floor", "description": "The 1837 ban on covered heads hasn't been enforced on religious headwear in recent times, but the proposed amendment would create an explicit exemption.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-seek-rule-change-formally-allow-hijabs-yarmulkes-house-floor-n938056", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2652016/181119-ilhan-omar-congress-cs-423p_9a94c058f59931236810f0dd9883609d.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:19:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Newly empowered Democrats plan to let lawmakers wear religious head coverings on the House floor by creating an exception to a hat ban that has existed since 1837 \u2014 when there was reportedly very little debate before the enactment of a rule prohibiting what one member then described as the \u201creally harmless but apparently indecorous practice\u201d of indoor hat-wearing.\n\nIn recent years, the rule hasn't been enforced to preclude members, staff or religious leaders from wearing head coverings on the floor, but the victory of Minnesota Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar, a Muslim who wears a headscarf, has put a spotlight on its continued existence.\n\nDemocrats say they will add an exemption for religious headwear under their new package of rules changes for the next Congress, which begins in January, so that the protection of religious expression is explicit. The language will also cover someone wearing a head covering due to illness and loss of hair.\n\n\"Democrats know that our strength lies in our diversity, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or religion,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in a statement to NBC News. \u201cAfter voters elected the most diverse Congress in history, clarifying the antiquated rule banning headwear will further show the remarkable progress we have made as a nation.\"\n\n\"This change will finally codify that no restriction may be placed on a member\u2019s ability to do the job they were elected to do simply because of their faith,\" said incoming House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who is working on the amendment with Omar and Pelosi. \"The American people just elected the most diverse Congress in history and our rules should embody that.\"\n\nOmar applauded the plan.\n\n\"No one puts a scarf on my head but me. It\u2019s my choice \u2014 one protected by the First Amendment,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"And this is not the last ban I\u2019m going to work to lift.\"\n\nIn this month's midterm elections, Omar and Michigan Rep.-elect Rashida Tlaib, a fellow Democrat, became the first two Muslim women to win House seats. Tlaib does not wear a headscarf.\n\nOmar has been subjected to false claims about her views.\n\nOne post earlier this month, which went viral on Facebook, included a fake quote \u2014 \"I think all white men should be put in chains as slaves because they will never submit to Islam\" \u2014 attributed to Omar and printed with her image.\n\nPolitifact rated it \"pants on fire\" because it was entirely made up.\n\nDiversity of religious practice is, of course, nothing new to Congress.\n\nA little more than half of the members of the current Congress identify as Protestant Christians, according to a Congressional Research Service report based on data compiled by Congressional Quarterly and Pew Research Center.\n\nNearly one-third identified as Catholic at the start of this Congress in January 2015. There were 30 Jewish members of the House and Senate at that time, with Buddhists, Muslims and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints accounting for some of the other religions represented on Capitol Hill.\n\nAt times, religious and political imperatives have come into conflict for lawmakers.\n\nThe Rev. Robert Drinan, a Democrat who represented a House district in Massachusetts from 1971 to 1981, gave up his seat after Pope John Paul II decreed that priests could not hold elective office. Drinan didn't wear a hat on the House floor but he was never without his Roman collar.\n\nPelosi later noted that the pope's order resulted in the district electing Barney Frank \u2014 who is gay and Jewish \u2014 to succeed Drinan.\n\nNone of the current Jewish members of the House wear yarmulkes on the House floor or during their daily work activities.\n\nBut some staff aides do wear religious headwear there, and Pope Francis wore his skullcap when he addressed a joint session of Congress in 2015.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Claire Atkinson\n\nGreg Maffei has a view of the changing media industry that is broader than most.\n\nAs CEO of Liberty Media, his company owns stakes in the music industry (through internet radio company Pandora, satellite radio company SiriusXM, and ticketing company Live Nation), the sports industry (Formula One and the Atlanta Braves), cable systems operators (Charter Communications), TV production (Viacom) and digital media (food-focused Tastemade).\n\nIn a phone interview, Maffei talked about whether Netflix can survive the onslaught from tech platforms, Liberty\u2019s interest in Universal Music, and how a new tech platform window might evolve in sports.\n\nQuestion: Last week at your investor day, you talked about how content is a bad place to be and that\u2019s a scary time for media.\n\nAnswer: There\u2019s a massive amount of capital invested. Traditional players have a set way of monetizing across a platform, but they make the vast majority of their money off affiliate fees and advertising on cable \u2014 and that world is being challenged. Traditional viewing has declined because of over-the-top players. Netflix is the king of those and deserves massive credit, but they\u2019re going to lose $3 billion of free cash flow this year. It\u2019s not to say they won\u2019t ultimately win here.\n\nQ: Do you think they will?\n\nA: I suspect they will. They\u2019ve got to worry about an aggressive set of players who are even bigger and have even deeper pockets and other monetization means. Netflix has a monetization scheme that is more efficient and better than the cable guys. The question is, do the tech guys, who have potentially bigger revenue streams, use content in such a way to subsidize that they threaten the Netflix model?\n\nQ: John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media, has a lot of assets in content. Should he be selling?\n\nA: I\u2019m going to stay away from that one. You have to ask John what he thinks about his assets.\n\nQ: You mentioned that some video platforms would be RIP. Who are we talking about?\n\nA: We have to wait three years and print all those. I think cable has a much better future because the value of that pipe, that cable is still quite valuable. There are potentially more things around high speed data and mobile that can still make it quite an interesting business.\n\nQ: What happens to DirecTV and Dish?\n\nA: The traditional video players are challenged. You can see what\u2019s happening in the subscriptions of traditional players and the rise of virtual MVPDs [multi-video program distributor such as SlingTV].\n\nQ: You talked about Formula One and the possibility of selling over-the-top rights and your relationship with Amazon?\n\nA: I think there\u2019s a good chance that big digital platforms like Amazon will be bidders for content, bidders for sports rights. They increasingly already are. I think it\u2019s quite likely that Amazon will be bidders for us for our content, Formula One. I suspect they will be bidders on other forms of sport content too. Particularly global makes a ton of sense. They\u2019re global players.\n\nQ: Let\u2019s talk about music. You made a very interesting comment about the fact you would be interested in Universal Music and you have a long relationship with its owner, Vivendi. And they have said they want a strategic relationship. Do you see that coming together?\n\nA: A couple of points. There is some benefit if you are a distributor of music content there is benefit potentially to owning some of the underlying content. Secondly, they\u2019re obviously the leading player in music content and they have expressed an interest in finding a strategic partner. Would we look at that: Absolutely. That\u2019s the sum total. We\u2019d be silly not to.\n\nQ: Have you had talks with Vincent Bollore, [former Chairman and CEO and current board member of Vivendi.]\n\nA: No comment.\n\nQ: You own a piece of iHeartRadio\u2019s debt. Can you talk about your interest in the company?\n\nA: No. We own a piece of the debt. They have a plan to exit bankruptcy. If the plan goes forward the way it is, we\u2019ll be a small investor in the equity of the iHeartRadio Company, less than 5 percent, and we\u2019ll see where it goes from there.\n\nQ: Let\u2019s talk about sports. What is your interest in the regional sports networks being sold by Disney and Fox, and there are reports that Nascar could be on the market?\n\nA: The logical owners of the RSNs are either a big distributor or a big content owner. We would take a look because of the Atlanta Braves alone, we are big content supplier to them. We\u2019d be interested in taking a look. We like motor sports. If Nascar were available, we\u2019d certainly take a look.\n\nQ: Do you see big tech platforms buying exclusive rights to big sporting events or will a new platform window evolve where sports are offered on a tech platform first, and then move to broadcast TV and who comes first?\n\nA: There is going to be a big fight. These tech platforms all want to have a stronger position. The war is going to be in the home. One of the questions will be do they do things like buy content, maybe not exclusively for ever, but exclusively for some window? Because most content owners don\u2019t want to see their content be exclusively on any one platform because it limits exposure. They might window it to get an edge.\n\nQ: And who gets the first window?\n\nA: It\u2019s all about money, and it\u2019s all about who\u2019s got the pocket."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Sady Doyle", "title": "Without a way to reach women, the GOP's slow, painful death is all but assured", "description": "The GOP cannot pivot to regain female support because institutionalized misogyny \u2014 like racism \u2014 has become central to its mission.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/misogyny-has-become-central-republican-mission-gop-dying-result-ncna937401", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2649906/181116-new-congress-freshmen-gop-ac-707p_ac30c2cb0bbad6dd729aa9408953faef.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:04:00Z", "content": "Get the Think newsletter.

The blue wave of the midterms \u2014 substantially propelled by women\u2019s organizing and woman candidates \u2014 has left the Republican party scrambling to shore up support among suburban, college-educated women, who seem to be fleeing the party en masse. Yet for a party that has thoroughly and obsessively defined itself based on white male needs and sensibilities for at least a decade, the call to change may be impossible to heed. Times are moving too fast for Republicans to catch up.\n\nThe change is so obvious you can actually see it happening in real time. The 119th session of Congress will contain more female representatives than at any point in history, many of them women of color. Several of those women are historic firsts for other reasons, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, or Kyrsten Sinema, D-AZ, the first openly bisexual senator, or Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, Democrats from Michigan and Minnesota, respectively, who share the joint distinction of being the first Muslim women in Congress.\n\nYet even as the overall portion of women in Congress grows, the number of Republican women \u2014 nearly all of them white \u2014 is shrinking. The parties\u2019 priorities are reflected in their leadership: The GOP increasingly looks white and male, even as its opposition becomes more visibly diverse.\n\nEven as the overall portion of women in Congress grows, the number of Republican women \u2014 nearly all of them white \u2014 is shrinking.\n\nThere is one big, obvious reason why women are fleeing the Republican party, and it\u2019s currently sitting in the Oval Office: Trump, the big, orange, ugly angry reminder of exactly how much men can get away with. The shamelessness of Trump\u2019s misogyny \u2014 pussy-grabbing confessions, calling an ex \"horseface\" \u2014 has shocked formerly apolitical women into an awareness of just how powerful patriarchy is. The cruelty of his administration reads as an extension of his personal bullying, making the Trump years feel less like a political catastrophe and more like a personal attack. If the United States had not just witnessed the gruesome spectacle of Brett Kavanaugh being confirmed despite multiple sexual misconduct allegations, that blue wave might have been much smaller.\n\nParty members unfortunate enough to possess a grain of self-awareness know this bodes ill for the future: \u201cThe party must do more to appeal to suburban voters, especially college-educated women,\u201d former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor writes in the New York Times. \u201cOnce a Republican mainstay, this group has been slowly moving away from us for the past few cycles.\u201d Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., has taken to Fox News, lamenting that Republicans got to address the suburban women problem, because it\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nThough race is elided in both men\u2019s statements, Graham and Cantor are almost certainly mourning the loss of suburban, educated white women. Women of color, and particularly black women, almost invariably vote Democrat. Trump carried the white female vote in 2016, like many a GOP candidate before him, and many white women still voted Republican in 2018 \u2014 in Georgia, where Stacey Abrams ran to be the first black female governor in United States history, early numbers showed that 75 percent of white women voted for her white, male, Republican opponent.\n\nYet the GOP\u2019s grip on those suburban white women is faltering. Hillary Clinton actually won the college-educated white female demographic in 2016, though her 51 percent majority was too slim to make a difference. Where 53 percent of white women voted Trump in 2016, only 49 percent supported Republicans this year, with another 49 percent voting Democratic. A Republican majority has given way to an even split. This is a slow erosion, not the definitive, revolutionary change many of us might hope for. But it is change, and that change is slowly eating away at the foundations of Republican power.\n\nIf the GOP intends to survive, then yes, it does have to get women back on board. Yet even in a moment of crisis, the party\u2019s messaging to women remains incoherent at best. The blue wave was made up in part by angry, frightened women, mobilized by typically \u201cfemale\u201d concerns \u2014 the public humiliation of Christine Blasey Ford, the continuing trail of sexual misconduct allegations against Trump, the likely fall of Roe v. Wade and even the need for common-sense gun control, which women are vastly more likely to support than men. Yet one of the Trump administration\u2019s first moves post-midterms was to unleash a new set of draconian rules attacking contraceptive and abortion access. One of these rules, which would allow insurance companies to bill separately for abortion care, could potentially notify your employer whenever you had an abortion.\n\nThe outreach to women isn\u2019t going to come by way of policy. But so far the party and its surrogates aren\u2019t attempting to woo women back with softer, sweeter media coverage, either.\n\nSo the outreach to women isn\u2019t going to come by way of policy. But so far the party and its surrogates aren\u2019t attempting to woo women back with softer, sweeter media coverage, either. Even as Graham and Cantor wonder whether the Republican Party is pushing women away, Fox pundit Laura Ingraham is taking to the air to condemn the incoming Democratic Congresswomen as misandrist she-beasts: \u201cA dark, pink cloud is gathering,\u201d she warned her viewers on Nov. 13. The menace of which she spoke? None other than \u201cthe newly elected crop of women on Capitol Hill,\u201d who are playing the \u201cpolitical gender card\u201d and going \u201con the war-path against white men.\u201d\n\nTo be clear: This is a party that is supposedly scrambling, desperately, to recoup female support and adapt to a moment in which there is a widespread demand for more women in power. Yet its strategy for winning those women back is to make them wear scarlet letters into the office and show them panicked news broadcasts about the apocalyptic, horizon-darkening evil of female politicians. (That Ingraham is herself female is relevant only insofar as it lets her get away with saying this stuff \u2014 misogyny is always more palatable when it comes from a female front, as Fox News realized long ago.) The GOP cannot survive if it continues to bleed female supporters, but it also cannot pivot to regain their support, because institutionalized misogyny \u2014 like racism \u2014 has become central to its mission.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 best hope, at this point, is that the women who have been shocked into new political awareness will become more complacent once Trump has left the picture.\n\nWomen are recoiling from the GOP because of Trump, but the problem is not just Trump, and it never was. Brett Kavanaugh, or someone very much like him, would likely have been confirmed under any Republican president. Women\u2019s access to contraception and abortion has been catastrophically dismantled since 2012, and most of that has happened on a state level. Paranoia about female power is at least as old as Pat Buchanan fulminating, in 1992, that Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cradical feminism\u201d would lead to a nation where children sued their parents, wives rebelled against their husbands and LGBT people (gasp!) received support from the White House.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 ongoing refusal to authorize VAWA, or renounce the NRA, or back equal pay protections or paid family leave, or do basically anything to improve the lives and hopes of women in this country, is not a Trump problem. Rather, it\u2019s endemic to the party, which has only secured its continued existence by exploiting white grievance and catering solely to the powerful. Given the demographics of American power, this ultimately means catering to white men at the expense of everyone else.\n\nYou cannot pivot from your core identity. You cannot reshape a Republican party that likes or helps women, because it would no longer be the Republican party as we know it. The GOP is right to worry about its woman problem, because no party can survive if it loses women. But the Republicans\u2019 best hope, at this point, is that women who have been shocked into new political awareness will become more complacent once Trump has left the picture.\n\nFor the rest of us, we can only hope that those women realize their problems go deeper than one bad president \u2014 and that their collective anger continues to erode the foundations of the GOP until the whole rotten structure tumbles to the ground."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Airbnb plans to remove listings in Israeli West Bank settlements", "description": "The company said it will take down some 200 listings and cease its operations in Israeli settlements \"that are at the core of the dispute between the Israelis and Palestinians.\"", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/airbnb-plans-remove-listings-israeli-west-bank-settlements-n938146", "urlToImage": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/3445866/1000x563_3445866.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T22:53:41Z", "content": "JERUSALEM Home-rental company Airbnb announced on Monday it would remove its listings in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, prompting outrage from Israeli officials.

He traveled in a huge box, at least three feet tall and weighing about 35 pounds. I carried him, still inside the box, up the four flights of stairs to my apartment. I guess you could say this was my first act of love for him.\n\nMister Swiss is a rather gigantic and vibrant Monstera Deliciosa, sometimes affectionately known as a Swiss cheese plant. (Get it?) I ordered him from Bloomscape, a direct-to-consumer, online-only plant retailer. After just a few days out of the box, positioned in a sunny corner of my living room, he began to stretch his big tropical leaves, sprout new ones and generally establish his domain.\n\nTending to Mister Swiss \u2014 watering him every week, dusting his leaves, rotating his pot so that one side doesn\u2019t get too much sun \u2014 makes me happy. I worry about him when I travel. I talk to him. And in return, I get healthier air and a living, growing subject for my Instagram feed. Over text and in person, I trade stories with friends about their own adventures in house plant care. It seems we\u2019re all slightly obsessed.\n\nMister Swiss in all his glory.\n\nWith the millions of Instagram posts tagged #plantsofinstagram, #urbanjungle and #plantlife, it\u2019s obvious we\u2019re not alone. But unlike other consumer trends, like those in fashion and beauty, the cultivation and care of houseplants has benefits that far outweigh the likes we might accumulate on social media. Plants improve the air around us and they also improve our moods, help us think more creatively and disconnect from the technology that might have motivated us to buy one in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s an escape from our screens, and something we can take care of outside ourselves. When it\u2019s all self driving cars and data in our contact lenses, we\u2019re still going to want plants.\n\n\u201cPlants resonate with millennials as an antidote to this insane connectivity,\u201d says Eliza Blank, founder and CEO of 6-year-old indoor plant retailer The Sill. \u201cAmericans spend 93 percent of our time indoors. It seems somewhat counter and somewhat intuitive because it\u2019s an escape from our screens, and something we can take care of outside ourselves. When it\u2019s all self driving cars and data in our contact lenses, we\u2019re still going to want plants.\u201d\n\nAnd Blank has the receipts to prove it: The Sill just closed a $5 million round of funding in August, and the company boasts more than 290,000 followers on Instagram. People like me \u2014 a millennial, living in a rental in an urban area, not ready for pets or kids (financially or otherwise) \u2014 are buying houseplants at a record pace. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the sale of seeds, flowers and potted plants have increased since 2016, and the 2017 National Garden Survey found that five of the six million Americans who took up gardening in 2016 were between the ages of 18 to 34. But why are millennials so drawn to the pastime?\n\nPEOPLE AND PLANTS: A TREND PASSED DOWN THROUGH GENERATIONS\n\nThe proclivity humans have towards plants is certainly not unique to the millennial generation: Houseplants are a concept that is believed to have originated in ancient Greece and Rome as early as 500 BC and in China as early as 200 CE. After all, the first imagined paradise on Earth was the Garden of Eden.\n\nIf you\u2019re scratching your head wondering how such an ancient concept can be considered \u201ctrendy\u201d \u2014 and why young millennials without access to outdoor space have embraced houseplants so passionately \u2014 it helps to look back a generation, to the parents of the young people driving up sales around the country. Caring for Mister Swiss (and his friends, a Calathea Freddie from The Sill and a Golden Pothos I picked up at Home Depot) takes up about ten minutes of my time each week, which feels like a nod to, but a far cry from, the hours upon hours my parents would spend tending to our yard and garden when I was growing up.\n\nThe yard of a home that they already owned when they were the same age I am now, which is amazing when you consider that, according to Neilson, two-thirds of millennials are renters, and they\u2019re more likely to live with roommates or family members than on their own.\n\n\u201cI was inspired to start the Sill in part because I grew up in a very green town and our home was filled with plants and we had a beautiful garden,\u201d Blank reflects. \u201cBut the way my mother uses time is very different from the way I use time, and the way the next generation will too. No 25-year-old that I know has six hours on a Sunday (or a backyard) to spend gardening, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have an interest in plants! We\u2019re helping to usher in this new way to garden that reflects the way millennials want to use their leisure time.\u201d\n\nJessie Artigue, a California-based entrepreneur, also says that her inspiration to start a home garden \u2014 that also includes an outdoor menagerie of lime trees, bougainvillea, dahlias and a rose bush named Barbra Streisand \u2014 comes from her mother. \u201cMy mom has always had the most beautiful gardens, so I\u2019ve been helping her since before I can remember,\u201d she says. \u201cWatching my mom from such a young age and seeing the joy that [gardening] continues to bring her, it just seems to make sense as to why I\u2019d (at least try to) follow in her footsteps.\u201d\n\nWHY ARE YOUNG PEOPLE SO DRAWN TO PLANTS?\n\nBeyond the nostalgia, millennials may be drawn to greenery because of the mental health benefits that come with fostering our green thumb. Blank points out that this is one social media trend that has IRL (or \u201cin real life\u201d) benefits. Unlike other decor purchases that also make great social content \u2014 like candles, throw pillows or art \u2014 plants are alive and require ongoing care. That sense of responsibility, the joy we feel as they grow and thrive, even just being around plants, is uniquely healthy for our physical and mental well-being in ways that may be particularly intriguing to the millennial generation.\n\nPlants are stress-busters.\n\nWith jam-packed schedules and around-the-clock connectivity, caring for a plant forces us to slow down and be mindful, which is proven to reduce stress. A study from the American Psychological Association on Stress By Generation found that young people report higher stress levels than older generations, and on top of that also admit that they are not managing it well. The study also found that millennials and Gen X-ers were more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors because of stress. So turning to plant care, as opposed to, say, heavy drinking or gorging on unhealthy food, could have real therapeutic benefits.\n\nEnvironmental psychologist Sally Augustin, Ph.D, suggests that caring for plants really is a healthy option for stress relief, and could explain why so many millennials are so drawn to the hobby. \u201cAs long as people aren\u2019t fanatically concerned with the health of your plants, and it remains a hobby rather than an obsession, relaxation will ensue.\u201d\n\nWe saw that our customers were calling their plants their \u2018babies.\u2019 A lot of our customers have plants before they have pets or kids. It\u2019s easy to draw life lessons from your plants and apply them to your life.\n\nIn fact, horticultural therapy has been in practice and recommended by psychologists and therapists since the 19th century to improve mental (and physical) health. Practitioners believe that interacting with plants can improve your mood and well-being. While horticultural therapy is largely centered around working in greenhouses and outdoor gardens, the same general practices and benefits can be gleaned from indoor houseplants, too.\n\nTaking care of something gives us a bigger purpose.\n\nMany young people who cultivate indoor plants liken themselves to parents. \u201c[The term] \u2018Plant Parenthood\u2019 was born out of the customers mouths,\u201d says Blank, of the trademarked phrase you\u2019ll find throughout The Sill\u2019s cheerful website. \u201cWe started calling it that when we saw that our customers were calling their plants their \u2018babies.\u2019 A lot of our customers have plants before they have pets or kids. It\u2019s easy to draw life lessons from your plants and apply them to your life.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that millennials are eschewing marriage and kids all together, we\u2019re just waiting longer. The decades of transition that put more and more women in the workplace pushed the median age of marriage from 20.8 for women and 23 for men in 1970, to 27.4 for women and 29.5 for men in 2018. Younger generations feel more pressure to have their lives figured out, so to speak, before getting married or having kids, so supplementing the need to nurture and care for someone or something with plants feels like a step in the right direction that won\u2019t drastically change our lives, our homes or our budgets.\n\nDr. Augustin echoes Blank\u2019s observation about the effects that caring for plants can have on our well-being. \u201cIt brings out and creates a habit of thinking of other living things, and what they need to survive,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople form an emotional bond with plants because plants have these beneficial psychological effects. Ultimately, we develop a desire to optimize the life of a plant and to keep it alive.\u201d\n\nWe are creating a sanctuary at home.\n\nFrom a purely aesthetic perspective, humans are wired to respond positively to plants and nature (as well as other forms of life). \u201cGreen, leafy plants are good for our mental outlook,\u201d says Augustin. \u201cSomething about the colors and the shapes helps our brains think more creatively, cut stress levels, and get along better with others.\u201d The hypothesis is part of a concept known as biophilia, which explores the idea that we (humans) are naturally drawn to other living systems like plants and animals, and have an innate desire to connect with and care for them.\n\nArtigue, who often works from home, says that houseplants are essential to her work life. \u201cMy environment has always been very important to my overall mental health, but also my creativity and productivity,\u201d she says. \u201cWorking from home (and being a visual and design-oriented person) means that my surroundings are a priority for me and plants just seem to make any corner or surface a lot more appealing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because [plants] affect our mood,\u201d says Augustin. \u201cWhen our mood is more positive and we\u2019re happier, our brains start to work in a different way. We think more broadly and creatively, which makes us better at problem-solving and getting along with others.\u201d For this reason, Augustin suggests placing green, leafy plants with curling, relaxed shapes (like pythos, ferns, and geraniums) around your home and office environments, too.\n\nPlants foster sense of pride and accomplishment.\n\nArtigue also notes that she gets to know each of her 15-plus house plants, and that she feels a sense of pride in tending to their specific needs, like you would for a pet or a child. She even sings to them while she waters them. \u201cThe house plants are my responsibility and my joy. Caring for them brings me a lot of happiness because there is a sense of accomplishment in keeping them alive. I like learning about each of their needs and preferences and watching them thrive when I do the right thing is weirdly very rewarding!\u201d\n\nAccording to Augustin, those rewarding feelings are great for our sense of self. \u201cKeeping a plant alive can definitely be an achievement that is consistent with a positive self-concept,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd for the sharing generation, displaying our plant \u201cparenting\u201d on social media is something that actually feels good. \u201cThe share-ability of plants isn\u2019t just because they\u2019re visual \u2014 our social channels are a reflection of ourselves,\u201d says Blank. \u201cIt\u2019s like a badge of honor, being a plant owner. Like, \u2018I\u2019m succeeding at something that\u2019s not tacky!\u2019It\u2019s not a humble brag, it\u2019s something to really be proud of and that other people can be genuinely supportive of, too, like, \u2018Hey! You kept that plant alive!\u2019\u201d\n\nGrowing together\n\nA well-cultivated plant can far outlive even our beloved pets, and can propagate more plants and literally grow alongside you and your family. \u201cI think about the plants that are in my childhood home, and most of them are actually older than I am,\u201d Blank reflects. \u201cPlants have a weird connection to time. There\u2019s a plant in my parent\u2019s home that was propagated from my grandparents\u2019 home and that plant has given life to plants in my friends\u2019 homes, and there\u2019s something so magical about that. This is why I find plants so compelling.\u201d\n\nWhile I initially put my green thumb to work in response to the beautiful potted plants I saw popping up on my Instagram feed, they\u2019ve quickly earned a place in my heart. The prospect of having Mr. Swiss and his friends long after I\u2019ve moved out of my funny East Village apartment \u2014 and perhaps even after I\u2019ve left New York \u2014 is both exciting and a little too big to dwell on for long. I don\u2019t have a car, or kids, or even a cat, and I have no idea if or when I ever will. But I\u2019ve got a large and cheerful Monstera Deliciosa that needs me, and as Jessie Artigue put it, caring for him really is my joy.\n\nMORE MENTAL HEALTH HELP\n\nWant more tips like these?

Cindy Hyde-Smith, who faces a runoff this month, said on Monday her campaign has returned a $2,700 donation from a Seattle businessman who was sued for discriminating against Muslims in his hiring practices.\n\nCampaign finance records show that Peter Zieve, who owns aerospace supplier Electroimpact, donated $2,700 to Hyde-Smith's campaign on Nov. 14.\n\nMelissa Scallan, a spokeswoman for Hyde-Smith's campaign, told NBC News that the campaign has since returned the donation.\n\n\"That donation was made online, and we have returned it,\" she said in a statement.\n\nPopular Info, a progressive newsletter, was the first to report this story.\n\nZieve was sued in 2017 by the state of Washington for refusing to hire Muslims at his company and expressed \"hatred\" for Muslims at work, according to court records. He also offered $1,000 \"marriage bonuses\" and \"child bonuses\" to employees to encourage them to procreate, according to the lawsuit, writing in an email revealed in court documents that he wanted to prevent the U.S. from becoming \"backfilled with rubbish from the desperate and criminal populations of the Third World.\" He was also accused of requiring applicants to submit photos of themselves before applying for engineering jobs at his company, records show.\n\nIn 2017, a year-long investigation by the Washington state attorney general found Zieve's company broke state law by discriminating on the basis of religion and marital status. Zieve then entered into a 42-month, court-monitored consent decree with the attorney general's office that required the Mukilteo-based company to pay $485,000 settlement and removed him from making direct hiring decisions.\n\nIn the consent decree, Electroimpact denied it did anything wrong.\n\nZieve donated to Hyde-Smith's campaign on Nov. 14, days after a video in which she says she would be \"on the front row\" if a supporter invited her to \"a public hanging\" went viral, but denied that her remark prompted his donation, according to The Jackson Free Press.\n\nZieve told The Jackson Free Press on Friday that he donated to the incumbent lawmaker's campaign because he believes \"she\u2019s a Republican.\" Asked about her remarks, he said, \"I don't know anything about that. Sorry, I can\u2019t help you. Bye.\"\n\nHyde-Smith faces a runoff election Nov. 27 against former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy, who is African-American. Her \"public hanging\" comments drew sharp rebuke from both sides, with many linking it to Mississippi's brutal history of racial violence and lynching against African Americans, though Hyde-Smith insisted there was no negative connotation.\n\nZieve, who did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News, has donated to several Republican candidates this year, according to campaign finance records. He also contributed to President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Adam Edelman", "title": "'Patently ridiculous': Former top intel officials hit back at Trump after criticism of bin Laden raid - NBCNews.com", "description": "NBCNews.com 'Patently ridiculous': Former top intel officials hit back at Trump after criticism of bin Laden raid NBCNews.com Former top members of the intelligence community rebuked President Donald Trump on Monday for deriding the retired Navy SEAL who over\u2026", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/patently-ridiculous-former-top-intel-officials-hit-back-trump-after-n938151", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2651946/181119-bill-mcraven-bin-laden-raid-cs-346p_6c1152a6118e48d78078afdd1fbb9522.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:56:29Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Adam Edelman\n\nFormer top members of the intelligence community rebuked President Donald Trump on Monday for deriding the retired Navy SEAL who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden as a \"Hillary Clinton backer\" and suggesting that he should have caught the al Qaeda leader sooner.\n\nResponses to Trump's comments about retired Adm. Bill McRaven, who has criticized the president's attacks on the press, poured in Monday from former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who said Trump should apologize.\n\n\"This president owes Admiral McRaven and all of the SEALS involved in that operation an apology for what he's saying. He's undermining his position as commander-in-chief. Not only with those that conducted the operation, but with the entire military,\" Panetta, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Defense under President Barack Obama at the time of the 2011 raid that killed bin Laden, said on MSNBC's \"Andrea Mitchell Reports\" Monday.\n\nIn a public statement issued later in the day, Panetta said Trump's \"statement criticizing McRaven for not getting Bin Laden sooner is patently ridiculous\" and \"demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of how our military and intelligence agencies operate.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Brennan, who was Obama's homeland security adviser at the time of the bin Laden raid and served as CIA director from 2013 to 2017, tweeted to Trump that \"you constantly remind us how substantively shallow & dishonest you are on so many fronts, which is why we are in such dangerous times.\"\n\n\u201cYou would need an extremely tall ladder to get anywhere near the level of intellect, competence & integrity of Bill McRaven & your predecessors,\u201d Brennan, a prominent Trump critic, said on Twitter.\n\nBrennan is a senior national security and intelligence analyst for MSNBC and NBC News.\n\nTrump revoked Brennan's security clearance in August, prompting McRaven to write an opinion article for The Washington Post urging the president to revoke his clearance, as well, so that he could \"add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency.\"\n\nClapper, who served as Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence from 2010 to 2017, told CNN Monday that the comments from the president were \u201ckind of typical, unfortunately, of President Trump.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cwhat this really is, rather than its misplaced criticism of Bill McRaven, it\u2019s really a slam at the intelligence community, who was responsible for tracking down Osama Bin Laden.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt reflects, I think, his complete ignorance about what that took,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Robert O\u2019Neill, a former Navy SEAL who claims to have fired the shots that killed bin Laden, told NBC News' Hallie Jackson Monday that \"what the president said about McRaven\" was \"a little inaccurate\"\n\n\"The raid to get Osama bin Laden was not only bipartisan, it was non-partisan. Everybody involved wanted to get him as soon as we could get him,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"Admiral McRaven is the reason that my SEAL team got it and Obama approved it. That's just as simple as it gets,\" he added.\n\nIn an interview with Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday,\u201d Trump blasted McRaven, who oversaw the raid, as a \"Hillary Clinton fan\" and said bin Laden should have been captured much sooner, though he did not explain how the Obama administration should have done so. The president made the comments after Wallace asked him about McRaven's criticism of Trump's attacks on the press.\n\nLast year, McRaven, who did not make an endorsement in the 2016 presidential election, called Trump's lambasting of the news media possibly \"the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime\" during a speech at the University of Texas.\n\nMcRaven responded on Sunday, telling CNN that he did not support Clinton or anyone else in the 2016 election. He emphasized that partisanship did not play a role in his career.\n\nOn Monday morning, however, Trump doubled down on his remarks, tweeting that, \"Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Family celebrates 7th birthday of girl electrocuted at a resort", "description": "The family of Zynae Green celebrated her seventh birthday at a medical facility where she requires around-the-clock care.

Instagram will also ask these users to change their passwords, which had been shared with these third-party apps, as a way to secure their accounts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built machine learning tools to help identify accounts that use these services and remove the inauthentic activity.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nThink recent climate disasters have been bad? Just wait, researchers at the University of Hawaii predicted Monday.\n\nRight now, one climate-linked disaster generally hits at a time, whether it\u2019s forest fires destroying swathes of California, hurricanes flooding Texas and Louisiana and completely devastating Puerto Rico, or heat waves killing thousands in Europe. By 2100, unless something drastic changes, a new report predicts regions will start dealing with multiple disasters all at once.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be crazy. We cannot imagine what will happen when all these things happen at the same time,\u201d said Camilo Mora, a geography and environment researcher at the University of Hawaii who led the study team.\n\nMora\u2019s team combed through more than 3,200 studies to try to paint a broad picture of what climate change is going to do to people over the coming century. They cross-referenced their findings against known disasters.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to look only at examples were climate change had already caused an effect,\u201d Mora told NBC News. \u201cThe evidence was absolutely mind-blowing to me.\u201d\n\nThe disasters they looked at included drought, warmer temperatures, floods, heavy rain and blizzards, heat waves, fires, sea level rise, storms, changes in the natural land cover and changes in ocean chemistry. \u201cWe found 27 attributes of human health impacted by climate hazards, of which death, disease and mental health were the most commonly observed,\u201d Mora\u2019s team wrote in their report, published in the journal Nature Climate Change.\n\nPeople can die from heat stress, drown during hurricanes, starve during droughts and suffocate in fires. Disease patterns can change as the insects that carry disease proliferate and spread yellow fever, malaria and dengue. The destruction of forests spreads disease, also, the team said.\n\n\u201cFor instance, forest fragmentation increased the density of ticks near people, triggering outbreaks of Lyme disease and encephalitis, fires drove fruit bats closer to towns, causing outbreaks of the Hendra and Nipah viruses, drought mobilized livestock near cities, causing outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever, and melting ice due to warming caused voles to find shelter in homes, increasing hantavirus infections,\u201d they wrote.\n\nChanges in ocean chemistry help cause deadly red tides and can favor the spread of cholera, they added. \u201cDrought forced the use of unsafe drinking water, resulting in outbreaks of diarrhea, cholera and dysentery,\u201d they added.\n\nFires across California and elsewhere worsen asthma and can lead to long-term health problems including heart disease, lung disease and cancer, they noted.\n\nAnd climate hazards have already affected mental health. \u201cFor instance, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were reported after storms in the United States, floods in the United Kingdom and heat waves in France,\u201d they wrote. Loss of sea ice has led to depression among Inuit people who have increasing trouble hunting and fishing.\n\n\u201cEvery single aspect of human life was impacted \u2014 the food and water you eat and drink, the air. It\u2019s making people more vulnerable to violence and forcing people out of their homes. How much of a horror movie do you want?\u201d Mora said.\n\nAnd these are things that have already happened. \u201cI think that it is already pretty bad. Just ask the people in California and Florida,\u201d Mora said. \u201cNow the choices are bad or terrible.\u201d\n\nThe rise of sea levels gets much of the attention that is focused on climate change, but other disasters are already occurring and will become more common, affecting people on every continent whether they live on the coasts or inland. \u201cThe evidence is pretty loud and clear,\u201d Mora said.\n\n\u201cThis is what we are doing to ourselves by being so careless with the release of greenhouse gases. That, to me, is the definition of stupidity: doing something that you know will hurt you.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, there are solutions.\n\n\u201cI am very optimistic that it can be reversed altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only do we have the technology to reduce emissions, but we can restore the ecosystems of the planet.\u201d\n\nOne example: planting trees. For instance, depending on the species, one tree planted in Hawaii can pull a ton of carbon out of the atmosphere in 10 years, because trees take up carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about turning out the lights or walking instead of driving,\u201d Mora said.\n\nSo the university began a challenge to try to encourage people to plant trees to offset their own energy use. The idea came from Mora\u2019s 11-year-old daughter Asryelle Mora Rollo. The university held an event over the weekend to gauge public interest.\n\n\u201cNearly 200 people came to set the record of planting 1,000 trees in one day. We ended up doing it in just two hours,\u201d Mora said. \u201cFor the USA that could mean upwards of billions of trees if everyone does their small contribution,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s something individuals can do on their own or in small groups, Mora said. \u201cIt is low-hanging fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe easiest solution here is for us to stop expecting politicians to do something.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Former Ohio judge accused in ex-wife's murder", "description": "Lance Mason, a former Ohio judge who was forced from the bench and served prison time for viciously assaulting his then-wife, has been arrested on accusations of fatally stabbing the same woman.

Humphrey said, \u201cThe ultimate moral test of any government is the way it treats three groups of its citizens.\"\n\n\"First, those in the dawn of life \u2014 our children, \" he added. \"Second, those in shadows of life \u2014 our needy, our sick, our handicapped. Third, those in the twilight of life \u2014 our elderly.\"\n\nAt the time, he said that Republicans had \"failed this basic test of political morality.\" But as a former psychiatric visiting nurse and now as a researcher working with family caregivers of persons with dementia, it's a test that many of us are failing.\n\nThat is because loneliness is a broad societal problem that affects not only Americans, but everyone on the globe, as social isolation becomes widespread with an aging population.\n\nSix million Americans 65 and older live alone in their communities, are homebound because of medical or emotional conditions or lack access to transportation. Many of these adults become physically isolated and emotionally lonely, contributing to what many call the loneliness epidemic.\n\nRecent research indicates that loneliness and social isolation are risk factors for depression, impaired cognitive performance, dementia progression, compromised immune system, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke and an overall increased mortality risk.\n\nTake my elderly neighbor, Mary: we first crossed paths when she was walking her dog, and we smiled at each other, nodded and went about our business.\n\nSoon after that, on a weekend evening, I noticed she had not picked up her newspaper that day, so I knocked on her front door. She was surprised but grateful that someone cared enough to check on her; few other people ever had. We remained friends for a decade, until she passed away.\n\nHer circumstances are far too common. As a psychiatric visiting nurse in the mid-90s, I had the privilege to work with many older adults confined to their homes or apartments because of physical and/or mental health limitations. In many cases, apart from the occasional Meals-on-Wheels volunteers, I was the only other human being they interacted with over the course of each week.\n\nMy presence ensured that they maintained a degree of safety, medication adherence and, if necessary, that they would be connected with further medical care before a crisis ensued.\n\nBut not every elderly person living along can count on having a nurse used to working with older adults living on her block or coming by the house. And, according to recent U.S. Census Bureau data, the population of adults 65 and over will grow from 49.2 million in 2016 to 78 million by 2035. As the number of older adults increases at such a fast pace, so will the needs for addressing their health care needs, including those created by loneliness and isolation.\n\nAccording to recent reports, a few major health care providers across the U.S. are already defining loneliness and isolation as social determinants of health. These providers are taking measures to connect their clients through basic measures such as home visits, phone contacts and providing transportation. The hope is that preventing and combating loneliness and isolation in older adults may prove cost effective.\n\nMany of the connecting strategies to combat loneliness, though, rely on technology. While online messaging, voice and video chatting and social networking are effective ways to connect, not all older adults in the U.S. and globally can afford or have access to the Internet. In 2017, a Pew Research Center Survey found that only four in 10 seniors in the US owned a smartphone, only about half of them subscribed to high speed internet services and only one-third accessed social networking platforms such as Facebook or Twitter.\n\nLow tech programs are out there, but they're mostly volunteer-based \u2014 like The Little Brothers-Friends of the Elderly, a non-profit volunteer agency with eight chapters across the United States. Volunteers visit those who are homebound, organize holiday and birthday celebrations, and even plan mini-vacations.\n\nMany organizations are just beginning to launch self-assessment and awareness campaigns to bring attention to the problem of social isolation in older populations. The AARP Foundation, launched Connect2Affect in 2016, collaboration with organizations such as the Gerontological Society of America, United Healthcare, Give an Hour and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. The goal was to increase understanding of the complexities of loneliness and isolation in older adults, raise awareness of the public health implications, and rally resources to create evidence-based interventions.\n\nOther nations are addressing the loneliness epidemic directly through policy initiatives.\n\nIn 2017, The Australian Coalition to End Loneliness enlisted the combined efforts of academic, not-for-profit, national, local and community-based resources to raise awareness, advocate and create evidence-based interventions to eradicate loneliness.\n\nAnd in the United Kingdom, a recent report by The Jo Cox Commission inspired the Prime Minister Theresa May to pledge the equivalence of $23 million to tackle loneliness that afflicts an estimated 4 million British older adults. Earlier this year, May charged the Minister for Sport and Civil Society to include loneliness under its auspices, naming Tracy Crouch its Minister of Loneliness.\n\nMedicare spends a reported additional $6.7 billion per year to treat the health problems of persons with limited social connections.\n\nIn the absence of a national plan endorsing the older adult loneliness epidemic in the U.S., millions simply rely on volunteer-based, charitable organizations to address a serious problem with severe public health implications. Or they will have neighbors, like Mary did, who are able and willing to visit them and check on their well-being.\n\nRelying on individuals to be their neighbor\u2019s keeper may indeed be a moral test for the individual but, as Humphrey opined four decades earlier, it is also a moral imperative of government and policy makers to create policies, standards and frameworks to care for those who have paved the paths before us.\n\nI am willing to check on people I understand may need my help; I see it is not only as a kindness, but as my social responsibility. In the broader picture, how we as a nation address the needs of our elderly is a reflection of our humanity. This is difficult political test as well, and one that must be passed and passed on, not passed over."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Denise Chow", "title": "NASA's Mars InSight lander set for nail-biting touchdown", "description": "NASA's Mars InSight lander is scheduled to land on the red planet on Nov. 26, where it will study the red planet\u2019s deep interior.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/nasa-s-mars-insight-lander-set-nail-biting-touchdown-red-ncna938086", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2651796/181119-nasa-mars-insight-mission-space-cs-128p_d787c23dbd9d862804c63e8b9774e10e.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:16:00Z", "content": "SUBSCRIBE Nov. 19, 2018 / 8:16 PM GMT After a roughly 300-million-mile journey lasting more than six months, a new NASA probe is set to touch down on Mars next week, beginning a two-year mission to peer deep inside the red planets interior.

The landing coverage starts at 2 p.m. EST and will be available to watch on NASA TV.\n\nThis will be NASA\u2019s first attempt at landing on Mars since the space agency\u2019s Curiosity rover pulled off its own nail-biting landing in 2012 \u2014 a feat NASA characterized at the time as \u201cseven minutes of terror.\u201d\n\nUnlike the Curiosity rover, Insight won\u2019t be able to move about on Mars. But using a suite of instruments and a seven-foot-long robotic arm, it will drill up to 16 feet below the surface at its landing site, Elysium Planitia, a broad plain that has been called \u201cthe biggest parking lot on Mars.\u201d\n\nHaving a big target makes things a bit easier, but it doesn\u2019t mean the landing will succeed. NASA has lost Mars-bound spacecraft before, including the Mars Polar Lander in December 1999, and a complex sequence of steps must go right for the touchdown to be successful.\n\nAbout seven minutes before it reaches the top of Mars' atmosphere, the InSight lander will be released from the spacecraft that ferried it to Mars. Ensconced inside its heat-protecting \u201caeroshell\u201d capsule, the 800-pound lander will descend 70 miles through the thin Martian atmosphere for about six minutes. Then, a supersonic parachute and a series of descent engines will slow the spacecraft before it touches down on shock-absorbing legs.\n\nThe InSight lander will be the first to study the red planet\u2019s deep interior. The goal is to compare the interior of Mars to that of Earth so that scientists can better understand how these rocky worlds formed more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nIn addition to its robotic arm, the lander is equipped with a seismometer and thermometer designed to measure the frequency and magnitude of marsquakes and show how heat from deep inside Mars makes its way to the surface.\n\nThe InSight lander isn\u2019t designed to search for life, but NASA says understanding Mars' geological evolution could offer clues about its present or past habitability. The agency is planning to launch a new rover to Mars in 2020 that will look for signs of past microbial life on the red planet.\n\nWant more stories about Mars?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Christopher Watts sentenced to life imprisonment for killing pregnant wife, two daughters", "description": "Colorado dad Christopher Watts was sentenced to life in prison after he pleaded guilty to killing his pregnant wife Shanann and their two daughters Bella and Celeste.

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaker of the House, presenting her a narrow path to reclaiming the speaker\u2019s gavel in the next Congress.\n\nThe letter is the first concrete expression of opposition from current Democratic lawmakers and incoming members of Congress since the party won control of the House in the midterm elections.\n\nPelosi, who served as the first female speaker of the House from 2007 through 2011, and has been the top Democrat in the lower chamber since 2002 \u2014 has been aggressively campaigning for the speakership amid opposition from a small but vocal group of incumbents within her own party who have long advocated for new leadership and several incoming members who won election pledging they would oppose her as speaker.\n\n\u201cAs we head toward the 116th Congress and reclaim our Democratic majority, we believe more strongly than ever that the time has come for new leadership in our caucus,\u201d the Democrats wrote in the letter.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to Leader Pelosi for her years of service to our Country and to our Caucus. She is a historic figure whose leadership has been instrumental to some of our party\u2019s most important legislative achievements,\u201d they continued. \u201cHowever we also recognize that in this recent election, Democrats ran and won on a message of change.\u201d\n\n\"We are committed to voting for new leadership in both our caucus meeting and on the House floor,\" they added.\n\nA senior Democratic aide dismissed the letter and the effort. \"If your strategy relies upon Nancy Pelosi giving up, you will lose every single time. Ninety-four percent of the caucus didn\u2019t sign this letter,\" the aide said.\n\nThe speaker is elected by the full House of Representatives and the winner must obtain the support of a majority of members voting. If a member votes \u201cpresent,\u201d then the number determining the majority decreases.\n\nDemocrats are slated to hold 232 seats for the next Congress, with five races still yet to be called. If no member votes \u201cpresent,\u201d then Pelosi would have to win the support of 218 members, meaning she would not need the support of 14 Democratic lawmakers.\n\nOf the sixteen Democrats who signed the letter, four are newly elected. One signee, Ben McAdams, has not yet been elected, but currently leads Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, in his uncalled race.\n\nThe letter does not represent the totality of Democratic opposition to Pelosi. Two members who have contemplated running against Pelosi as speaker, Reps. Karen Bass, D-Calif., and Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, did not sign on to the letter. Abigail Spanberger, who vowed to oppose Pelosi in her successful Virginia campaign, said on Friday after leaving a meeting with her that she would not sign the letter but would still vote against her.\n\n\u201cI will not be voting for Leader Pelosi,\u201d Spanberger told reporters then. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about her; it\u2019s about wanting new leadership.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s opponents do not yet have a clear candidate to run against her. Fudge said she would announce after Thanksgiving if she would jump in the race.\n\nFudge did not add her name to the letter, just as Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, did not sign a similar letter against Pelosi to be minority leader in 2016 because he had decided to run against her.\n\nPelosi spent much of Thursday and Friday of last week holding individual meetings with new members. She has also met with groups of Democrats as part of her outreach efforts, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition, and the Problem Solvers Caucus.\n\n\"I've been very vocal about the need for leadership change. It's nothing personal on any of the leaders that we have, they've been great, but they've been there for 16 years and it's time for a new generation of leaders to take over,\u201d Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., who organized the letter, said last week. \u201cThe first thing is that we have to show is that the leader cannot get to 218, which she won't be able to.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted over the weekend that Pelosi \"deserves\" to be speaker, adding that he \"can get as many votes as she wants.\" He tagged Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., the Republican leader of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, who indicated he would consider voting for Pelosi for speaker if she agreed to rule changes that would dilute power from leadership."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Stephen A.

Nu\u00f1o\n\nFLAGSTAFF, Arizona \u2014 There was concern before the midterms that Democrats were not doing enough to bring out voters, especially Latinos. But early indications are that Hispanic voters came out in historic numbers, and in the Southwest and parts of the West, this made a difference for Democratic candidates.\n\nThe midterm results also helped change the narrative: When it comes to the Latino vote, this election may be a watershed moment where the results are defined more by \"what is,\" rather than \u201cwhat could have been.\u201d\n\nRaquel Ter\u00e1n, a newly elected state legislator in Arizona\u2019s District 30, said the changes are the first she's seen of this magnitude in over a decade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 12 years; it\u2019s been red, red, red. Now we are purple,\" said Ter\u00e1n, who successfully fought off a \"birther\" legal attack through a subpoena challenging her citizenship status. \"We are going in the right direction and what energizes me is the base; we have a solid group,\" said Ter\u00e1n.\n\nArizona elected Democrats to four statewide offices, U.S. Senate, Arizona secretary of state, superintendent, and corporate commissioner. Texas elected their first two Latinas in Congress, Veronica Escobar and state Sen. Sylvia Garcia. In a much-watched race for the U.S. Senate. New Mexico's entire House delegation is now occupied by racial and ethnic minorities and the state elected its first Latina Democratic governor, Michelle Luj\u00e1n Grisham. Newly elected congresswoman Xochitl Torres-Small pulled out a major upset in a district that has only been in Democratic hands twice in the past 60 years.\n\nNevada Democrat Jackie Rosen defeated Republican Sen. Dean Heller by almost 5 percent,, and the Democrats won races for governor and lieutenant governor, while also further expanding their power in the state legislature. Kate Marshall, who was elected Nevada's lieutenant governor, has family roots in Mexico. Perhaps most symbolic, even further west Democrats turned once deep red Orange County in California blue.\n\nWhile groups wait for more figures on midterm voting, legislators and organizations point to several factors that helped increase Latino turnout.\n\nGroups leveraged Latino voter interest\n\nEarly voting data showed tremendous energy among Latino voters; there was an estimated 174 percent increase in Hispanic early voting; polling showed that Latino interest in this midterm election matched Presidential year election levels.\n\nWhereas in 2014, 37 percent of registered Latinos showed interest in the election compared to previous elections, in 2018, the number increased to 55 percent.\n\nEven before the midterms, three states that had already surpassed their total 2014 votes even before Election Day \u2014 not just early votes \u2014 were Southwestern states, such as Arizona, Nevada, and Texas.\n\nIn Arizona, candidates like Ter\u00e1n worked with organizations that represent a broad swath of the Latino community, with progressive concerns that ranged from the environment to women's reproductive rights.\n\nJosselyn Berry is a spokesperson for ProgressNow Arizona, a coalition of organizations in the state. Berry said the coalition organizations knocked on over 1 million doors this election.\n\n\u201cThis has been a long road, the coalition of organizations, like LUCHA, Mi Familia Vota, and CASE Action have been growing and registering voters for years, this just didn\u2019t happen overnight,\" she said.\n\nEven Democrats who didn't win in the midterms, like gubernatorial candidate David Garc\u00eda, overcame other Democrats in the midterms largely on the energy of these groups who threw their organizing weight behind him in the primary election.\n\nGreater investment in minority engagement\n\nRep. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that the DCCC spent about $30 million to engage minority voters, including hiring minority contractors and minority businesses for their engagement strategy.\n\nIn Clark County, Nevada, Democrats targeted Latino voters in part by mobilizing organizations with strong Latino membership, such as the Culinary Workers Union, which helped secure the victory of Democrat Jacky Rosen for the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn Arizona, the DCCC targeted candidates in heavily Latino districts, like Democratic House candidate Ann Kirkpatrick in Pima County, adding her district to their \"red to blue\" list of races receiving support from the official arm of the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nIn California, Gil Cisneros was backed by the DCCC in deep red Orange County, California, and he recently was declared the winner in a tight congressional race, with popular writer Gustavo Arellano declaring old Orange County dead at 129 years old.\n\nEnergized minority candidates\n\nCandidates like Latina Xochitl Torres Small mobilized to harness voters in a year that saw more growing dissatisfaction with the current administration, especially among Hispanic voters.\n\n\"She ran a solid campaign to beat a Republican candidate who tied herself to President Trump, indicating that in a year where the races were largely about the president, southern New Mexico sided with the Democrat,\" said Gabriel Sanchez, an associate professor at the University of New Mexico. \"This is the first woman to ever represent CD-2 in New Mexico, which is also indicative of the pink wave.\"\n\nTorres Small raised a record breaking $1.9 million in the final quarter of the election. According to the New Mexico Political Report, this was \"the most money raised in a quarter by any congressional candidate in New Mexico history.\"\n\nBut Torres Small also worked to create broader voter appeal in her traditional Republican district, including by being tough on border security and reminding voters she supports gun rights while calling for \"common sense\" gun safety measures.\n\nTurning a page\n\nIncreased turnout among Hispanics is significant considering it has remained fairly stable since the 1980s, despite a growing population. The U.S. Census Bureau has produced their Voting and Registration Supplement after every election since 1980. Latino turnout in 1980 was 46 percent, reaching a high of 52 percent in 1992, and then struggling within that range ever since. The turnout rate among Latinos in 2016 was just under 48 percent.\n\nTurnout numbers in midterm elections are lower than in presidential years for all groups and particularly Latinos who had a record low of 27 percent in 2014.\n\nSome of the reasons for lower participation rates are structural, such as barriers to participation in some states, including Voter ID laws that disproportionately impact minorities and a disregard for details, like printing out ballots with inaccurate information to constantly changing locations for voting on Election Day.\n\nWhen it comes to political parties, Republicans and Democrats have been criticized for not doing enough to reach out and mobilize Hispanic voters.\n\nAfter increased participation in the midterms, the question, especially for Democrats and progressive organizations, is whether they will continue building on the momentum ahead of 2020.\n\nSome groups say they're ready to build on their recent political victories.\n\n\u201cWe are not slowing down,\u201d said ProgressNow Arizona's Berry.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Rob Waters, Kaiser Health News", "title": "Gun control vs. psychiatric care: post-shooting debate obscures reality", "description": "Those who insist that mental illness has no connection to violence, and those who argue that the mentally ill should be locked up, are both wrong, experts say.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/gun-control-vs-psychiatric-care-post-shooting-debate-obscures-reality-n938076", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2651731/181119-thousand-oaks-vigil-se-1223p_982837214a57edd00d31f0077b20626d.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:57:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Rob Waters, Kaiser Health News\n\nAfter the recent mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California, in which 11 people were killed at a country music bar, President Donald Trump struck a familiar refrain: \u201cIt\u2019s a mental health problem,\u201d he said of the gunman, identified by authorities as Ian David Long. \u201cHe was a very sick puppy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 students and staff members in February, Trump tweeted that there were \u201cso many signs that the shooter was mentally disturbed.\u201d\n\nPublic health and mental health experts counter that blaming the violence on the mentally ill is unfair and inaccurate, pointing instead to lax gun laws. \u201cMost violence is not committed by people who are mentally ill,\u201d said Dr. Ren\u00e9e Binder, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at San Francisco and a past president of the American Psychiatric Association. \u201cEven if you took everyone who had any kind of mental illness and locked them up and gave them meds, it would hardly make a dent on the problem of violence.\u201d\n\nPost-shooting debates are typically painted in black and white \u2014 but research suggests that the truth is less clear-cut.\n\nThe \u201cstigma-busting advocates,\u201d who insist that mental illness has no connection to violence, and the \u201cfearmongers,\u201d who assert that \u201cthe mentally ill are a dangerous menace and should be locked up,\u201d are both wrong, said Jeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University who has studied patterns of violence in major U.S. cities.\n\nWhile it is true that mental illness plays only a small role in most forms of violence, including individual homicides, its role is larger in mass shootings.\n\nAbout 60 percent of mass shooters have a history of serious mental disorders and two-thirds have never been seen by a mental health professional, said Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, who has spent years studying mass public shootings. While that suggests a greater need for treatment, the one-third who did get help \u201ccarried out an attack anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even getting mental health care is not the panacea people make it out to be.\u201d\n\nA March for Our Lives rally against gun violence in New Orleans on March 24. Emily Kask / AFP-Getty Images file\n\nFor instance, James Holmes, who killed 12 people in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater in 2012, had been treated by a psychiatrist and spoken of homicidal thoughts. But he was not reported to authorities because he expressed no concrete plan.\n\nSeung-Hui Cho, whose mental problems dated to childhood, repeatedly talked to campus counselors two years before he killed 32 people and wounded 17 others at Virginia Tech University in 2007. Diagnosed with a mood disorder after threatening to harm himself in 2005, he was hospitalized overnight and ordered by a judge to receive outpatient treatment. But, mysteriously, he was not assessed or treated.\n\nOften, shooters\u2019 propensity for violence is easier to see in hindsight.\n\nSix months before the shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, police responded to a 911 call about yelling and banging coming from inside the house where Long, the accused, was living with his mother. They found an \u201cirate\u201d young man acting \u201cirrationally\u201d and called in a mental health crisis team. The social workers on that team evaluated and concluded that there were no grounds to place him under a psychiatric hold.\n\nIt is unclear whether the officers were told of his history as a machine gunner in Afghanistan, which after the shooting led to speculation that he had post-traumatic stress disorder. Later, Long's high school track coach said he had assaulted her.\n\nCalifornia allows authorities to place people on a 72-hour hold to evaluate their mental states \u2014 a practice similar to that in many states. But the standard for such holds, known in California as a 5150, is quite high, said Dr. Garen Wintemute, an emergency physician who heads the University of California Firearm Violence Research Center in Sacramento.\n\nTo be held, people must pose a serious imminent threat to themselves or others or be so gravely disabled that they can\u2019t take care of themselves, he said. The law does not take drug abuse into account, Wintemute said.\n\n\u201cA 5150 involves taking a person into custody sometimes against their will,\u201d Wintemute said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that\u2019s done lightly.\u201d\n\nDr. E. Fuller Torrey, the psychiatrist who founded the nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center 20 years ago, has long argued that society needs to be more forceful in getting care for the severely disturbed \u2014 and requiring it when necessary \u2014 to prevent suicide, mass shootings and other violence.\n\nHis goal is to get more state legislatures to pass bills like Kendra\u2019s Law in New York and Laura\u2019s Law in California, which allow judges to order mentally ill people into outpatient treatment. His organization helped draft both of those bills and has helped win passage of similar laws in at least 16 states. In California and some other states, however, the reach of the law is limited by whether counties decide to implement the approach.\n\nDuwe takes no position on the idea of mandated treatment but said that doing so to prevent events that happen only a few times a year makes little sense. \u201cMass public shootings are more commonplace than they ought to be, but they are still too infrequent to design policies based on addressing such rare events,\u201d he said.\n\nGun laws that exclusively target people with mental health histories also make little sense, said Drs. James Knoll and George Annas, psychiatry professors at the State University of New York Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse, in a 2016 article in Psychiatry Online.\n\nThey \u201cwill be extremely low yield, ineffective, and wasteful of scarce resources,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWintemute argued that other strategic interventions may work better. He advocates fixing problems in the nationwide system of background checks, which requires firearm dealers to verify with the FBI that a purchaser isn\u2019t a felon, fugitive, domestic abuser or dangerously mentally ill.\n\nHe said flaws in the law include the fact that private sales, including those at gun shows, are exempt; that only federal, but not state, agencies are required to submit data to the background-check database; and that thousands of cases of violence by military service members \u2014 including that of a shooter who killed 26 people in a Texas church in 2017 \u2014 are not reported.\n\nWintemute also helped draft a California law that took effect in 2016 that allows family members or law enforcement officials to seek a temporary restraining order barring a potentially violent person from buying guns and removing any already in their possession.\n\nThese so-called gun violence restraining orders don\u2019t involve a mental health assessment, Wintemute said, but are designed to let family members temporarily get guns away from a relative at risk of doing harm, including suicides. The order can last up to three weeks and can be extended for up to a year after a hearing, in which the gun owner can ask a judge to return the weapon.\n\nIn California, 190 orders were issued through the end of last year, Wintemute said, results he described as disappointing. Numbers for this year have not yet been compiled, but Wintemute said they are growing. So far, 13 states have passed similar laws, beginning with Connecticut in 1999. Eight, including Florida, approved them in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting, and Florida has already issued 450 such orders, Wintemute said.\n\nPhysicians can play a key role by asking patients and family members if they own guns and encouraging the family to seek a gun order if they\u2019re worried, Wintemute added.\n\n\u201cIf physicians are willing to see this as \u2018If you see something, say something,\u2019 and bring it to families\u2019 attention, we could decrease rates of suicide and possibly mass shootings,\u201d he said.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.

Arguably, this is a far more fascinating word than 2017\u2019s winner \u201cyouthquake,\u201d chiefly because \u201ctoxic\u201d reflects how single words can expand and change in meaning over time.\n\n'Toxic' has evolved from being solely literal to figurative, too\n\n\u201cToxic\u201d originated in the mid 1600s as the Latin \u201ctoxicus,\u201d a derivative of \u201ctoxicum,\u201d which comes from the Greek \u201ctoxik\u00f3n,\u201d meaning, \u201cbow poison.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe word went form being something very literal until the 20th century. Then around [the emergence of] \u2018toxic waste,\u2019 our consciousness was raised at the importance of the word as it related to our environment,\u201d explains Sherwood.\n\nAccording to Oxford\u2019s research, we\u2019re using \u201ctoxic\u201d to describe everything from chemicals and gas to masculinity and relationships.\n\nThis shift allowed us to go even further with \"toxic\" by using it figuratively and metaphorically.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201880s, we started to see a number of books on self-help and workplace dynamics where \u2018toxic\u2019 began to behave like a buzzword,\u201d says Sherwood. \u201cSoon after we saw \u2018toxic relationships\u2019 emerge, but by then it was already in the water [as a word with a figurative meaning] and now it\u2019s reached a level of total saturation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Oxford\u2019s research, we\u2019re using \u201ctoxic\u201d to describe everything from chemicals and gas to masculinity and relationships. We\u2019ve embraced the word as a kind of blanket descriptor for anything deeply but often invisibly harmful.\n\nWe\u2019re drawn to \u2018toxic\u2019 because it\u2019s feels more unnatural than \u2018poison\u2019\n\nBut why \u201ctoxic\u201d and not \u201cpoisonous\u201d, I asked John Black, PhD, chair, Department of English and co-director of Medieval Studies at Moravian College.

Li\n\nTwin storms are headed for rural Northern California this week, bringing conditions that could both help and hinder efforts to put out the Camp Fire, the deadliest blaze in the state's history, officials said Monday.\n\nHeavy downpours are predicted for Paradise, California, and surrounding areas, where at least 79 people have been killed in the wildfire that\u2019s been raging for nearly two weeks, authorities said. The statewide death toll is at 82, with three people dying in Southern California.\n\nThe first rains are expected to hit on Wednesday morning and to continue until a brief respite on Thursday afternoon or evening, according to NBC meteorologist Kathryn Prociv.\n\nThen another round of showers is forecast to come Friday and last through Saturday morning, with the two storms together bringing between at least 1 inch and as much as 3 inches of rain, Prociv added.\n\nThe precipitation itself won\u2019t put out the fire, but could moisten the earth and slow the killer blaze\u2019s spread, Sacramento City Fire Capt. Keith Wade told NBC News on Monday.\n\n\u201cWill it (rain) extinguish the fire? No. But it could hinder its ability to spread,\u201d said Wade, who is in Butte County helping local firefighters.\n\nThe problem could be if rain totals push beyond 3 inches. That's when rivers and streams could flood, and rain-soaked earth could become mud capable of trapping firetrucks.\n\n\u201cThis could bring difficulties in moving equipment in and out of the area and how crews can operate in remote areas. The rain changes everything,\u201d Wade said. \u201cIt\u2019s (the rain) definitely a mix.\u201d\n\nA potentially worst-case scenario from the combination of fire and rain would be killer mudslides akin to those in Santa Barbara County earlier this year, according to Prociv.\n\nAt least 21 people were confirmed dead and two remain missing from those mudslides that devastated the upscale community of Montecito in January, a Santa Barbara County fire spokesman said Monday.\n\nThe disaster happened after the massive Thomas Fire weeks earlier consumed more than 280,000 acres, stripping land of trees and weakening soil.\n\nThen about 2.5 inches of rain triggered the mudslides.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose all of your trees and your root system that soaks up all the water, you lose your ability to stop boulders and other debris from falling downhill, Prociv said.\n\nThe Camp Fire in the rural northern part of the state has been burning since Nov. 8 and has charred at least 151,000 acres and leveled virtually the entire town of Paradise, authorities said.\n\nIt was 66 percent contained as of Monday morning.\n\nAt least 11,713 homes and 472 businesses have burned down. The number of people still missing after the blaze was 699 on Monday night, down from nearly 1,300 a few days before."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Former Ohio State wrestler says he 'loves' Jim Jordan but calls team doctor\u2019s sexual abuse \u2018systemic\u2019", "description": "Former Ohio State wrestler Michael DiSabato, the first to come forward with sexual abuse allegations against Dr. Richard Strauss, told university trustees on Friday that he\u2019s \u201cnot here to disparage\u201d former assistant coach and current Congressman Jim Jordan.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/fmr-ohio-state-wrestler-praises-jim-jordan-but-calls-team-doctor-s-sexual-abuse-systemic-1374953539707", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/osuthumb.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:04:33Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Former Ohio State wrestler says he 'loves' Jim Jordan but calls team doctor\u2019s sexual abuse \u2018systemic\u2019\n\nFormer Ohio State wrestler Michael DiSabato, the first to come forward with sexual abuse allegations against Dr. Richard Strauss, told university trustees on Friday that he\u2019s \u201cnot here to disparage\u201d former assistant coach and current Congressman Jim Jordan."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Nicole Acevedo", "title": "'Dream come true': Migrant caravan LGBTQ couples celebrate mass wedding", "description": "At least seven LGBTQ couples with the migrant caravan took part in a mass-wedding celebration in Tijuana, Mexico before they seek asylum in the United States.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/dream-come-true-lgbtq-couples-migrant-caravan-marry-seeking-asylum-n938051", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2651706/181119-caravan-gay-wedding-tijuana-se-1140a_f838c799fee70254aabaaf4dbd717539.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:54:00Z", "content": "Nov. 19, 2018 / 6:54 PM GMT At least seven LGBTQ couples who traveled through Mexico with the migrant caravan commemorated their love during a symbolic mass-wedding celebration in the border town of Tijuana.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Garrett Haake and Adam Edelman\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Three Senate Democrats filed a federal lawsuit on Monday to block Matt Whitaker from serving as the acting U.S. attorney general, claiming that his appointment to the post by President Donald Trump was unconstitutional.\n\nIn a suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., alleged that Trump's appointment of Whitaker violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because Whitaker was never confirmed by the Senate to serve in any position \"requiring the advice and consent of the Senate,\" which includes the job of attorney general.\n\nNews of the lawsuit, filed against Trump and Whitaker, was first reported by the Daily Beast.\n\n\"By designating Mr. Whitaker to perform the functions and duties of the Attorney General without having been subject to Senate confirmation, President Trump has unlawfully denied the Plaintiffs their right, as sitting U.S. Senators, to vote on whether to consent to his appointment to that role,\" the trio of senators, who are all members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in the suit.\n\n\"Defendant Whitaker has not been confirmed to serve as a principal Officer of the United States or to serve in any other position requiring the advice and consent of the Senate,\" they wrote. \"Defendants are therefore violating the Appointments Clause.\"\n\nThe senators' complaint asks the court to declare Whitaker\u2019s appointment unconstitutional and to enjoin him from serving as acting attorney general.\n\n\"Installing Matthew Whitaker so flagrantly defies constitutional law that any viewer of School House Rock would recognize it. Americans prize a system of checks and balances, which President Trump's dictatorial appointment betrays,\" Blumenthal said in a joint statement from the three senators on Monday.\n\nWhitehouse added that \"the stakes are too high to allow the president to install an unconfirmed lackey to lead the Department of Justice \u2014 a lackey whose stated purpose, apparently, is undermining a major investigation into the president.\u201d\n\nIn a statement issued later Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., lauded his colleagues for filing the \"important\" suit, and for \"shining a bright light on the president's unconstitutional appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general.\"\n\nWhitaker had been serving as chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions before being appointed as acting attorney general on Nov. 7, after Sessions announced that he was stepping down at thepresident's request.\n\nWhitaker was confirmed by the Senate as a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa \u2014 a position he held from 2004 to 2009. But he was not confirmed by the Senate to be Sessions' chief of staff or to be acting attorney general.\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker now oversees special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian electoral interference and possible ties between Trump's campaign and Moscow.\n\nThe suit Monday comes just days after opponents of Whitaker's appointment asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that he is not legally qualified for the job.\n\nWhitaker cannot be in the position, the challengers contended, because he wasn't confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTom Goldstein, the Washington lawyer who filed the challenge to Whitaker's appointment in the Supreme Court Friday, is also behind a similar suit brought last week by the state of Maryland in federal court.\n\nThe Trump administration has vigorously defended Whitaker's appointment. An opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel said the government has identified over 160 times throughout U.S. history when presidents appointed non-Senate confirmed government officials to serve in high level positions. In recent years, the opinion said, such appointments were made by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nIn appointing Whitaker as acting attorney general, Trump acted under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the latest version of a law on the books since 1868. In its current form, it says the president can fill a vacant position at a Cabinet department in one of three ways \u2014 designating the deputy to take over, choosing someone nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a different job, or naming someone serving in a senior position in the relevant agency for at least 90 days.\n\nWhitaker fits the third category, because he was named chief of staff to Sessions more than a year ago, in September 2017. His previous Senate confirmation for U.S. attorney in Iowa doesn't count for the purposes of the Vacancies Reform Act, because he stepped down from that position in 2009.\n\nGarrett Haake reported from Washington, and Adam Edelman reported from New York."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Jessica Levinson", "title": "Jessica Levinson Jim Acosta and CNN's legal battle with Trump is far from over.

A federal judge ordered that the White House temporarily re-issue CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass for 14 days. The White House had stripped Acosta of his access after a particularly tense exchange with President Donald Trump on Nov. 7. The federal judge who handed down the ruling in favor of Acosta was Judge Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee.\n\nWhile heralded by CNN \u2014 and First Amendment advocates \u2014 this ruling was not initially cause for much celebration. While Acosta had won the first round, the Trump administration at first vowed to once again rescind Acosta\u2019s press pass. Acosta responded by requesting another emergency court hearing.\n\nThe fact that the White House blinked is good news for journalists, but it's still worth paying attention to why the administration tried to take Acosta's pass away in the first place.\n\nNow it seems the White House has decided it won't continue fighting this particular battle. \"We have made a final determination in this process: your hard pass is restored,\" read the letter co-signed by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and deputy chief of staff Bill Shine. Additionally, the White House has laid out new rules for journalists, including limiting all reporters to only one question and explicitly stating that reporters must yield the microphone when asked.\n\nThe fact that the White House blinked is good news for journalists, but it's still worth paying attention to why the administration tried to take Acosta's pass away in the first place. The White House had argued that as a matter of law it had the power to revoke the press pass of any journalist whose reporting it disagrees with. The White House was explicitly arguing, in other words, that it has the authority to choose who can and cannot have access.\n\nThis is, like so many other positions held by the Trump administration, a sharp break from past practice and understanding. While not every reporter is granted a press pass, previous administrations have provided press passes to a wide variety of outlets with a wide variety of viewpoints. This will not be the last time that the Trump administration attempts to exert significant control over the press.\n\nForty-year-old case precedent indicates that a reporter\u2019s access to the White House should not be denied for reasons that are either arbitrary or less than compelling.\n\nAcosta does not have a First Amendment right to be called on in the White House briefing room. But he does have a First Amendment right to report on the news without fear that he will be stripped of his press pass because of what he says or how he says it. The White House would no doubt prefer to chill the questioning of aggressive reporters. But our country and our First Amendment traditions are at odds with such behavior.\n\nAcosta won on Monday, there is no doubt about that. But the fight between Acosta and the Trump administration has opened up a new front in an epic and existential battle about the freedom of the press that will likely continue for the length of Trump\u2019s time in office.\n\nThe fight between Acosta and the Trump administration has opened up a new front in an epic and existential battle about the freedom of the press.\n\nAfter he was stripped of his press pass, Acosta, along with his employer, CNN, sued the White House alleging violations of both the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment. The First Amendment protects the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech. The Fifth Amendment protects against deprivation of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due process of the law.\u201d\n\nAcosta asked for a temporary restraining order to get his press pass back. Essentially, Acosta asked the judge to force the White House to reinstate his pass while the case was still being heard. By ruling in Acosta\u2019s favor, Kelly suggested that Acosta was likely to succeed in his suit, but did not indicate why. Had Trump continued to fight it, Kelly\u2019s ultimate ruling could have been based on either Acosta\u2019s First Amendment claims, Fifth Amendment claims, or both.\n\nWhat Kelly\u2019s narrow ruling did immediately address was only Acosta\u2019s Fifth Amendment claims. Acosta argued that he was entitled to some sort of due process, like notice and a right to be heard, before the White House stripped him of his press pass. In other words, the reporter basically argued that the White House could not revoke his pass without giving him a reason for that revocation and a chance to be heard to argue against that revocation. The judge \u2014 correctly \u2014 agreed in the context of the emergency injunction. But this left open the possibility that the White House could still revoke Acosta\u2019s press pass later if it comes back with a better, or fairer, process for doing so.\n\nKelly also did not rule on Acosta\u2019s claims that his First Amendment rights were violated. If the White House had continued to fight this case, we would have expected to hear plenty of arguments about how Trump\u2019s rhetoric against Acosta and CNN violated the First Amendment. Acosta would likely have pointed to Trump\u2019s statements calling CNN \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d in order to argue that the White House\u2019s decision to revoke his press pass amounted to a content-based restriction.\n\nIf the White House had continued to fight this case, we would have heard plenty of arguments about how Trump\u2019s rhetoric against Acosta and CNN violated the First Amendment.\n\nIn the land of First Amendment law, there are two types of restrictions \u2014 content-neutral and content-based. An example of a content-neutral restriction is a noise ordinance that says residents in certain areas cannot play music over a certain level during the middle of the night. The law applies to everyone, regardless of who is playing the music or what the message of the music is. An example of a content-based restriction is a noise ordinance that says residents in certain areas cannot play rap music over a certain level during the middle of the night. The second law is content-based because it singles out a specific type of music for its message, or content.\n\nJudges are rightly worried about content-based restrictions because they often look like government censorship. The purpose of the first law is to let people sleep through the night without loud music waking them up. The purpose of the second law is to prevent people from playing a specific type of music.\n\nAcosta argued that the White House\u2019s decision to revoke his press pass was based on Trump\u2019s dislike of CNN, Acosta and Acosta\u2019s coverage and message. This would have amounted to a content-based restriction. If Kelly agreed with this argument, it could have been hard for the Trump administration to successfully defend against this suit. If, on the other hand, Kelly believed the White House\u2019s decision was based on Acosta\u2019s conduct, not his content, then Acosta would have a hard time winning his First Amendment claims."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Minyvonne Burke", "title": "Colorado dad Christopher Watts sentenced to life in prison for killing his pregnant wife and young daughters", "description": "Christopher Watts, the Colorado man who murdered his pregnant wife, Shanann, and their 3- and 4-year-old daughters in August, was sentenced to life in prison Monday.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/colorado-dad-christopher-watts-sentenced-life-prison-killing-his-pregnant-n937931", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_33/2534131/180816-christopher-watts-al-1753_8d568661a79807d37daa85251a56f678.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:04:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Minyvonne Burke\n\nThe family of Shanann Watts, who was found dead in mid-August with her two young daughters, called Christopher Watts a \"heartless monster\" during his sentencing hearing Monday, but said they did not want him to get the death penalty.\n\nChristopher Watts, 33, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, kept his head low and cried as Shanann's family members addressed the courtroom.\n\n\u201cI trusted you to take care of them, not kill them,\" Shanann's father, Frank Rzucek, said in an emotional statement. \"They also trusted you, the heartless monster, and then you take them out like trash. You disgust me.\"\n\nShanann's brother, Frankie Rusick Jr asked: \"What kind of person slaughters the people they love the most?\"\n\nShanann Watts, and her two daughters, Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3.\n\nFollowing the statements, the judge sentenced Watts to three consecutive sentences of life in prison with no possibility for parole. He was also sentenced to 48 years for the unlawful termination of pregnancy, which will run consecutively with the three life sentences.\n\nWatts will serve two additional life sentences for first-degree murder of a child under the age of 12, and 36 years run consecutively for three charges of tampering with a deceased body.\n\nShanann, 34, was found dead in mid-August in a shallow grave on the property of Anadarko Petroleum, where Watts worked. She was 15 weeks pregnant at the time with a boy the couple planned on naming Nico. The bodies of Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3, were discovered inside oil tanks.\n\nSandy Rzucek, Shanann's mother, cried as she addressed the room.\n\n\"I have no idea who gave you the right to take their lives but I know God and his mighty Angels were there,\" she said.\n\nWatts earlier this month pleaded guilty to five counts of first-degree murder, three counts of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of unlawful termination of a pregnancy. His plea deal spared him the death penalty.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t want death for you because that\u2019s not my right,\" Sandy Rzucek said. \"Your life is between you and God.\"\n\nChristopher Watts sits in court for his sentencing hearing on Nov. 19, 2018, in Greeley, Colo. RJ Sangosti / The Denver Post via AP\n\nWatts' parents, Cindy and Ronnie Watts, also spoke telling the courtroom that the murders \"should have never happened.\"\n\n\"This is something we will never get over. We will always mourn the loss of our family,\u201d Cindy said.\n\nPolice said in an affidavit unsealed about a week after the bodies were discovered that Shanann came home after midnight on Aug. 13 after a business trip. Watts told detectives that he awoke around 5 a.m. and had a talk with his wife about separating.\n\nHe said he left for work just before 5:30 a.m., which authorities were able to confirm with a neighbor's security camera.\n\nAs police searched for Shanann and the girls, Watts publicly pleaded for their safe return, telling reporters that he was \"torn up inside\" and he wanted \"everybody to just come home.\" He also said his wife had left and taken their daughters to a friend's house and had never come back.\n\nHis facade as a distraught husband soon crumbled, however, when police learned that Watts had lied to investigators about being in an affair with a co-worker. According to the affidavit, Watts then changed his story saying that he \"strangled Shanann to death\" after seeing her kill Bella and Celeste. He then directed authorities to the location of where the bodies were buried.\n\nAnadarko Petroleum fired Watts on Aug. 15, the day he was arrested. The causes of death weren't previously made public, but Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke said during Monday's sentencing that Watts strangled Shanann and then smothered Bella and Celeste.\n\n\"Imagine the horror in Bella's mind as her father took her last breaths away,\" he said, telling the room that Bella \"fought back for her life.\"\n\n\"The defendant then methodically and calmly loaded their bodies into his work truck \u2014 not in a hasty or disorganized way.\"\n\nIn an interview last week, the woman Watts had an affair with described how he showed little emotion while his family was missing and appeared calm. Nichol Kessinger, 30, also said Watts had lied to her and said he was close to finalizing his divorce with Shanann and was looking for a new apartment for him and the girls.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a logical explanation for what he did,\u201d Kessinger told The Denver Post about the murders. \u201cIt\u2019s a senseless act, and it\u2019s horrific.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Parents of victim in New York limo crash that killed 20 are suing the operators", "description": "Parents of 28-year-old woman who was among 20 killed in deadly limousine crash in rural Schoharie, New York, have filed a lawsuit against the limo company's owner.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/parents-one-20-people-killed-new-york-limo-crash-are-n938006", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_40/2595971/181007-schoharie-fatal-crash-se-317p_f4fdc4610ffdc9371f18a9cabb57d373.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:55:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

She was unaware that they had concocted this scheme.\"\n\nHe said a recording McClure said she made of a heated conversation between her and her boyfriend in September serves as proof of her innocence. In the recording, which NBC News has not verified, McClure is heard telling D'Amico, \"I had no part in any of this ... I might be going to jail because of something that you said.\"\n\n\"You don\u2019t go to jail for lying on TV, you dumb b****,\" D'Amico says to McClure.\n\n\"But who made me lie on TV?\" she responds.\n\nThe couple had appeared on ABC, the BBC and NBC to tell their story of their efforts to help a homeless man who had come to McClure's assistance on a Philadelphia freeway ramp, according to a brief filed by the prosecutor on the case, Scott Coffina.\n\nIn the recorded conversation between McClure and D'Amico, she also appears to refer to the money that the couple raised for Bobbitt, which he has claimed they mostly kept for themselves.\n\n\"I never said that I never spent a dollar,\" McClure said to her boyfriend.\n\nThe saga started in November 2017 when McClure started a GoFundMe that she said was for a homeless man, Bobbitt, who had given her his last $20 after she ran out of gas on the freeway ramp.\n\nMore than 14,000 people donated to the campaign, which received widespread media attention for what appeared to be a heartwarming tale.\n\nBut the story began to unravel when Bobbitt sued the couple in August, saying McClure, a receptionist for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and D'Amico, a carpenter, had kept most of the money for themselves.\n\nBobbitt's attorneys said he only received $75,000 of the money raised and claimed the couple spent the donations on items such as a BMW and luxury vacations to Florida and Las Vegas.\n\nThe couple denied the allegations and said they had withheld some of the money because they feared Bobbitt would spend it on drugs.\n\nThe lawsuit prompted authorities to look into the case.\n\n\"The entire campaign was predicated on a lie,\" said Coffina, the prosecutor in Burlington County, New Jersey, in announcing charges against the trio last week.\n\nThe prosecutor said McClure had texted a friend an hour after the campaign went live admitting that the ran-out-of-gas story was bogus, but Bobbitt was real. \"'I had to make something up to make people feel bad ... So, shush about the made up part,'\" Coffina said the text read.\n\nMore than 60,000 messages between McClure and D'Amico were seized from their iPhones detailing their financial woes, including bills and debts, and how they began thinking of Bobbitt when the idea of the hoax first took root, the prosecutor said.\n\nBut Gerrow, McClure's lawyer, said \"it wasn\u2019t until September when meeting with prosecutors that she came to realize that she had been used by both of them.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for D'Amico said Monday that he's surprised by McClure's defense. \"I don\u2019t know how Kate is playing the victim now.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Herb Weisbaum\n\nSome of the country\u2019s biggest and most prestigious cancer treatment centers are using misleading testimonials that don't disclose their results aren't typical, according to a watchdog report.\n\nOut of 48 cancer centers, 90 percent were \u201cdeceptively promoting atypical patient testimonials,\u201d in television and digital marketing material, according to the report, \u201cDeceptive Marketing of Hope,\u201d published last month by Truth In Advertising (TINA.org), a nonprofit consumer group.\n\nThe report included high-profile cancer treatment names such as MD Anderson in Houston, Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, Dana-Farber in Boston, and Moffitt in Tampa, Florida.\n\nIt also called out Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA), a for-profit hospital headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, that is the top-spender on cancer center advertising and marketing, according to Kantar Media.\n\n\u201cCancer patients and their families [are] facing devastating odds of survival and have a right to know the truth,\u201d said Bonnie Patten, TINA.org's executive director. \u201cTo sway this uniquely susceptible population\u2019s decisions as to where they should seek treatment by exploiting false hope is simply not acceptable.\u201d\n\nAmericans spend nearly $150 billion annually on cancer care, according to the National Institutes of Health. To attract those dollars, treatment centers across the country spend tens of millions of dollars in advertising.\n\nTestimonials with atypical results\n\nIn one video testimonial on the Memorial Sloan Kettering website, patient Carl, last name withheld, shares his gratitude for the medical team who saved his life by successfully treating his pancreatic cancer diagnosed in 2009.\n\n\u201cI never once felt like a number; I always felt like a person,\u201d he said.\n\nThe five-year survival rates for someone with pancreatic cancer is only 8.5 percent, a fact not mentioned in the emotional video.\n\nUnder FTC's guidelines, for-profit companies must disclose the expected performance numbers if the results shown aren't in advertising aren't typical.\n\nNon-profits, which includes many medical centers, aren't in the federal agency's jurisdiction, and are instead regulated by state deceptive marketing laws.\n\nIn one testimonial for CTCA, Chuck G., a patient diagnosed with stage 3 esophageal cancer in early 2001, addressed the issue of numerical results.\n\n\u201cBy early October 2001, I was cancer free,\" he stated. \"My recovery defies all statistics. But I agree with my doctors that \u2018statistics mean nothing to believers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe testimonial didn't disclose that the five-year survival rate for stage 3 esophageal cancer is 23.6 percent.\n\nIn 2018, over 130 instances of CTCA marketing material showcased a cancer patient with life-threatening diagnosis doing well after being treated at one of CTCA's five centers, TINA.org's investigation found. But the materials cited didn't close the majority of cancer patients with the diagnosis shown don't survive past five years. TINA.org has since filed a deceptive marketing complaint with the FTC.\n\nIn 1996, CTCA settled an FTC lawsuit against it and other cancer centers by agreeing to not make misleading use of patient testimonials. That agreement ended in 2016.\n\nAdvertiser responsibility\n\nNBC contacted the five cancer treatment centers that spent the most money on advertising last year that were cited by TINA.org for using misleading testimonial ads. Dana-Farber declined to comment. The rest defended their advertising practices in statements to NBC News.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, Memorial Sloan Kettering said it stands by the \u201cintegrity\u201d of its communications and the importance of enabling patients to share their experiences.\n\n\"Our communications address both the success and the complexity of current available and experimental treatments,\" the company said.\n\nCTCA said in a statement to NBC News, \"To ensure clinical accuracy and tell our story in an informative and responsible manner, all of our advertising undergoes meticulous review prior to publication.\u201d\n\nIt noted that all of the patients volunteered to share their stories in their own words, without any compensation, in the interest of helping others who receive a similar diagnosis.\n\nMD Anderson said it \"takes great care to ensure our messages are accurate, appropriate and responsible\" and that it has a \"responsibility to educate the general public about prevention, early detection, treatment, research and survivorship.\"\n\nMoffitt Cancer center said every testimonial is based on actual medical results specific to that patient.\n\n\u201cThe patient testimonials used by Moffitt provide an outlet for our patients and their loved ones to share their cancer journey in a transparent and authentic way, regardless of the outcome,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nAdvertising is designed to persuade people. To do that an advertiser needs to put their best foot forward. No one expects a hospital to talk about the patients that couldn\u2019t be helped.\n\nBut an advertiser has a legal obligation to make sure testimonial ads are handled carefully, Georgetown University Law Professor David Vladeck, former Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the FTC said, so they don\u2019t mislead or deceive.\n\n\u201cIt is clearly misleading to use a case that is not typical in an ad and not disclose that; viewers have no reason to think that the case isn't typical, and the advertiser knows that, so in these cases the deception is intentional,\u201d Vladeck told NBC News.\n\nTINA.org's executive director Patten said the group didn't seek to prevent consumers from information that could help them distinguish cancer centers from each other.\n\n\u201cThat said, I don't think patients should ever make any health care decision based on patient testimonials,\" said Patten.\n\n\"Every person\u2019s health journey is unique and individual, so they can't rely on those [stories] to make their decisions.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Alyssa Newcomb", "title": "Apple CEO Tim Cook defends Google relationship", "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company\u2019s relationship with Google, saying it\u2019s \u201cnot a perfect thing\u201d but that he believes the company has the best search engine.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-defends-google-relationship-n937981", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2651566/181119-tim-cook-1528_a54600f5dfcad50f183f6c0a3fc7e108.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:38:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Alyssa Newcomb\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook defended his company\u2019s relationship with Google, saying it\u2019s \u201cnot a perfect thing\u201d but that he believes the company has the best search engine.\n\nDuring an interview with Axios that aired on HBO on Sunday, Cook, who has equated the data collection practices of other technology giants to \u201csurveillance,\u201d pointed to Apple\u2019s efforts to minimize user tracking while still offering Google\u2019s search engine.\n\n\u201cWe have private web browsing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe have an intelligent tracker prevention. What we've tried to do is come up with ways to help our users through their course of the day.\u201d\n\nGoogle currently pays Apple to serve as the default search engine for iPhone and iPads.\n\n\"It's not a perfect thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cI'd be the very first person to say that. But it goes a long way to helping.\u201d\n\nWhile Facebook and Google face a reckoning over their handling of user data and privacy, Apple has remained virtually untouched by the drama sweeping through Silicon Valley.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Apple from providing a platform and doing business with companies that have a fundamentally different approach to privacy. Facebook, a frequent Cook target, still has its full suite of apps available for download in Apple\u2019s App Store, including a Facebook-built messaging app for kids.\n\nLast month, in a speech given to European lawmakers in Brussels, Cook rebuked his Silicon Valley neighbors for hoarding data, which he said can be \u201cweaponized against us with military efficiency.\u201d He didn\u2019t name any particular companies, but made it clear which company he was talking about.\n\n\"Every day, billions of dollars change hands and countless decisions are made on the basis of our likes and dislikes, our friends and families, our relationships and conversations, our wishes and fears, our hopes and dreams,\u201d he said.\n\nCook has said in the Axios interview that he thinks regulation is now \u201cinevitable.\u201d In March, he said Facebook should have \u201cself-regulated\u201d but that it was probably too late.\n\nGood question to Tim Cook from @inafried: Why does Apple accept billions from Google, when Apple fundamentally disagrees with Google's privacy practices? (Cook called it \"surveillance\" last month.)https://t.co/apRx2TE88S \u2014 Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) November 19, 2018\n\nApple positioned itself as a champion of user privacy long before the current public awakening. In 2016, Cook notably declined to cooperate with the FBI when authorities sought to unlock an iPhone that was part of a criminal investigation.\n\nApple also continues to add more privacy controls for users, including secure password management and has bolstered its intelligent tracking feature in Safari, which Apple said prevents companies from tracking users as they browse the internet."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "F.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By F. Brinley Bruton\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking that it was business as usual in the Saudi capital on Monday during King Salman's annual speech to the country's Shura Council.\n\nJust days after Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor recommended the death penalty for five suspects in the murder of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, the king did not mention the firestorm of controversy swirling around his country. The CIA believes the king's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the killing.\n\nKing Salman Anadolu Agency / Getty Images file\n\nKing Salman did voice support for the kingdom's judiciary, which will be handling the investigation into Khashoggi's Oct. 2 killing in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\n\u201cThe kingdom was founded on an Islamic approach based on the establishment of justice, and we take pride in the efforts of the judiciary and the public prosecution in the fulfilling the duty entrusted to them, and we affirm that this country will not deviate from the application of God's law,\u201d he said during the speech to the unelected body that advises the absolute monarch.\n\nAfter initially vehemently denying any official involvement in the killing, the Saudis claimed Khashoggi \u2014 a former insider who became a prominent critic of Prince Mohammed \u2014 was killed by a team of rogue operatives.\n\nA series of official leaks have linked the prince to the killing, but the young royal has remained officially untouched by the kingdom's investigation.\n\nOn Friday, NBC News reported that the CIA had concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, according to a person briefed on the assessment. NBC News had previously reported that the U.S. intelligence community believes it's unlikely that Prince Mohammed could have had no connection to Khashoggi's death.\n\nAsked if the CIA had assessed whether the crown prince was behind the killing, President Donald Trump said on Sunday, \"They have not assessed anything yet. It's too early. That was a very premature report.\"\n\nDuring the speech, the king reiterated his support for his son's signature initiative to turn around around the oil-dependent economy and cut unemployment.\n\n\u201cOur country is undergoing a comprehensive developmental plan in accordance with the plans and programs of the kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030, which is proceeding in parallel and achieving its goals at satisfactory rates,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are aware of the efforts of the state to create more job opportunities and we directed the crown prince, the president of the Economic Development Affairs Council, to concentrate and develop the human capabilities and prepare the new generation for future jobs.\u201d\n\nAfter first becoming an international figure in 2015 upon being named deputy crown prince, Prince Mohammed was praised for weakening the country\u2019s powerful conservative clerics and increasing women\u2019s participation in the economy and society \u2014 including granting them the right to drive.\n\nMore recent efforts to silence dissent and a harsh crackdown on fellow princes, business leaders, rights defenders, women\u2019s activists and reforming clerics has raised the alarm, however. The brief kidnapping of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri and break with fellow Gulf kingdom Qatar have also worried traditional allies, including in the United States.\n\nThe king also defended another initiative spearheaded by his 33-year-old son: The disastrous war in neighboring Yemen. The conflict in the desperately poor country has helped created the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster and pushed half of the population, or some 14 million people, to the brink of starvation.\n\nWhile Khashoggi killing crystallized much of the growing international unease with Saudi Arabia, the kingdom as well as Prince Mohammed have become linchpins in the Trump administration\u2019s plans, like containing Iran\u2019s regional ambitions and delivering an Palestinian-Israeli peace plan.\n\nIn May 2017 during Trump\u2019s first visit abroad as U.S. leader, the president announced $110 billion in immediate sales of U.S. arms and equipment, with $350 billion in additional deals over the next 10 years.\n\nWhile it is unclear how much of Trump's announcement covered deals that had already been unveiled, the president has touted such arms sales in an effort to explain the importance of the relationship with the kingdom.\n\nRecently, bipartisan pressure has also been mounting on Trump to distance the U.S. from Saudi Arabia and in particular the crown prince. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, on Sunday harshly condemned the crown prince over the young royal\u2019s alleged role in Khashoggi\u2019s killing, calling the country\u2019s de facto ruler \"unhinged.\"\n\n\"The fact that he didn\u2019t know about it is impossible for me to believe,\" Graham said on Sunday's \"Meet The Press.\" The Republican said he hasn\u2019t been given an official briefing on the matter, but maintained that the conclusion that the crown prince had a role in Khashoggi's murder should be clear to anyone with knowledge about the country.\n\n\u201cIf he is going to be the face of Saudi Arabia going forward, I think the kingdom will have a hard time on the world stage,\u201d Graham said.\n\nOn Thursday, the United States announced sanctions against 17 Saudi Arabian officials in response to the killing."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dartunorro Clark", "title": "'Hamilton' biographer to headline White House correspondents' dinner", "description": "The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association on Monday announced it tapped famed presidential biographer Ron Chernow to be its featured speaker at its annual Washington, D.C. dinner next spring.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/ron-chernow-presidential-biographer-headline-white-house-correspondents-dinner-n937976", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2651551/181119-ron-chernow-author-cs-1025a_02291a3356a53b5577ef09927fb03497.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:09:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Grant, will be the featured speaker at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner next spring, the organization announced Monday.\n\n\"I'm delighted that Ron will share his lively, deeply researched perspectives on American politics and history at the 2019 White House Correspondents' Dinner,\" Olivier Knox, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, or WHCA, said in a statement. \"As we celebrate the importance of a free and independent news media to the health of the republic, I look forward to hearing Ron place this unusual moment in the context of American history.\"\n\nIt's a departure from tradition for the nearly 100-year-old dinner, where a comedian usually headlines a roast. At this year's event in April, comedian Michelle Wolf delivered blistering criticism of President Donald Trump, who was not in attendance, and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who was, touching off a firestorm.\n\nWolf responded to the news in a tweet on Monday, calling the association \"cowards.\"\n\n\"The @whca are cowards. The media is complicit. And I couldn't be prouder,\" she said.\n\nAt this year's dinner, Wolf, a former correspondent on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show,\" compared Sanders to a ruthless figure in the dystopian show \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" She added that Sanders \"burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye,\" referring to her makeup.\n\nHer act, which also skewered Democrats, other Republicans and the media, was met with a flurry of criticism, which led the former president of the association to issue a statement saying the comedian's monologue \"was not in the spirit\" of its mission.\n\nOthers, including many fellow comics, defended her, saying she spoke truth to power and spared no one. But Wolf said at the time that she had no regrets about her performance.\n\nTrump responded to Tuesday's announcement on Twitter, calling the annual dinner \"a good first step\" and suggesting that the new format might lure him to attend next year.\n\nTo which Wolf replied Tuesday night: \"I bet you'd be on my side if I had killed a journalist,\" which appeared to be a reference to Trump's earlier statement that his administration would stand by Saudi Arabia's rulers and take no action against them after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nChernow is an acclaimed biographer of presidents, and his book on Alexander Hamilton was the basis for playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda's Broadway hit musical. He has also written biographies of business tycoons J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller.\n\n\"The White House Correspondents' Association has asked me to make the case for the First Amendment and I am happy to oblige,\" Chernow said in a statement. \"Freedom of the press is always a timely subject and this seems like the perfect moment to go back to basics. My major worry these days is that we Americans will forget who we are as a people and historians should serve as our chief custodians in preserving that rich storehouse of memory. While I have never been mistaken for a stand-up comedian, I promise that my history lesson won't be dry.\"\n\nThe dinner is scheduled for Saturday, April 27.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 21, 2018, 12:45 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated when Michelle Wolf delivered the featured address at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner.

Harish Tyagi / EPA\n\nAn estimated 4.5 billion people across the world lack access to proper sanitation, said the report. Some 2.5 billion among them do not have adequate toilets, according to U.N. figures. The lack of toilets forces many to defecate in the open \u2014 in the streets, in the bushes and by rivers and other water sources.\n\nAmong the development goals set by the U.N. in 2015 is a target to ensure everyone has access to a safe toilet by 2030. But campaigners warn this goal will be hard to meet if governments and businesses do not put more money into the sanitation economy.\n\nSanitation is \"the business of the decade,\" said Cheryl Hicks, chief executive of the Geneva-based business group Toilet Board Coalition. She told The Associated Press that the group is urging commercial investment to help reduce toilet shortages in countries where governments cannot afford such infrastructure.\n\n\"Half the world needs toilets. They don't have them because the infrastructure is too expensive for governments,\" she said.\n\nAfrican countries are among the neediest.\n\nThe new report by WaterAid cites an estimated 344 million children in sub-Saharan Africa who lack a toilet at home, leaving them vulnerable to diarrhea and other water-borne infections.\n\nIn the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau, one of 101 countries surveyed by WaterAid, eight in 10 schools there lack adequate toilet facilities. The same study reported that 93 percent of households in the East African nation of Ethiopia lack a decent toilet.\n\nJoel Ssimbwa, an entrepreneur who has put up two low-cost facilities in impoverished parts of the Ugandan capital, Kampala, said he launched his business in 2016 after several times he needed to ease himself but had \"nowhere to go.\"\n\nIn September 2007 a Ugandan lawmaker told reporters he was \"badly off\" and helpless after being photographed urinating against a wall outside the Ministry of Finance in Kampala. He was later charged and fined, despite protesting the lack of sanitation facilities nearby.\n\nThere are fewer than 20 free public toilets in Kampala, a city of over 3 million people. Toilets in buildings across the city are often kept under lock and key, apparently to ward off unwelcome users.\n\nSsimbwa acknowledged that the Shs300 (8 cents) he charges may still be unaffordable to many, the reason he is working on a business model that would allow his clients to pay a uniform monthly fee instead of having to pay each time they check in.\n\n\"It is a drop in the ocean, but it creates awareness\" of what the government and others must do, he said, talking about his services."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Chinese author gets 10 years in prison for 'obscene' gay novel", "description": "The case went viral on Chinese social media as commentators asked how such a punishment made sense when sexual assault cases often draw lighter sentences.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/chinese-author-gets-10-years-prison-obscene-gay-novel-n937941", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_27/2061531/170705_chinese_flag_8566b136341a360e61cba62bc68684a9.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:26:00Z", "content": "Nov. 19, 2018 / 3:26 PM GMT / Source: Reuters BEIJING A Chinese court's 10-year jail term for an author of a homoerotic book found guilty of profiting from selling \"obscene\" literature has been met with disbelief among some internet users who question how the\u2026 [+2058 chars]", "fulltext": "/ Source: Reuters\n\nBEIJING \u2014 A Chinese court's 10-year jail term for an author of a homoerotic book found guilty of profiting from selling \"obscene\" literature has been met with disbelief among some internet users who question how the crime could warrant so severe a punishment.\n\nThe female author, surnamed Liu, was found guilty on Oct. 31 by Wuhu county court in eastern Anhui province after she self-published a book that \"obscenely and in detail described gay male-male acts\", according to state media.\n\nThe court ruled that the strict sentence was enforced due to her having made 150,000 yuan ($21,600) by selling over 7,000 copies, the article said.\n\nThe case went viral on Chinese social media at the weekend as commentators asked how such a punishment made sense when some sexual assault cases often drew lighter sentences.\n\nOne user shared an article about a case from 2010 when a man was jailed for 18 months for imprisoning children and commented: \"I don't understand the law, but there have been people who did things as inhuman as this and only get a year and a half.\n\n\"Why can't our vast and abundant China tolerate the word 'sex'?\" the user added.\n\nSome commentators suggested Liu's book should not be banned as gay erotic content known as \"bl\" or \"BoysLove\" is important for Chinese men to discover their sexuality.\n\n\"I also watch 'bl', because my family has traditional values,\" one user wrote about the case. \"Seeing this news today, and based on this kind of criminal law, I expect we will have to wait thousands of years for homosexuality to be legalized.\"\n\nPornography has long been illegal in China, but in recent years, the Communist Party has intensified efforts to clear away what it sees as inappropriate content, introducing new legislation, rewards and punishments to help its aims.\n\nAuthorities on Saturday launched a campaign to \"eradicate pornography and illegal publications\" by offering heightened rewards of up to 600,000 yuan for reporting banned content to the police, starting from December.\n\nIn April, Weibo announced a decision to remove pornographic, violent or gay content, singling out manga animations that often depict raunchy gay male relationships, but then reversed its decision after widespread criticism.\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dylan Byers", "title": "Inside Facebook, denial, tension and finger-pointing as crisis foments", "description": "As challenges mount from consumer organizations, politicians and journalists, Facebook's leadership remains convinced that it has a public relations problem.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/inside-facebook-denial-tension-finger-pointing-crisis-foments-n937911", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_15/2395071/180410-mark-zuckerberg-capitol-hill-redux-njs-1122_6cc4093fe12ca0b2ab8fa54c647eff00.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:21:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He also said he would not hesitate to fire employees who leaked information to the media.\n\nInternally, the leadership's decision to blame the media and the press shop has driven a wedge between them and members of the communications team who feel as if they've been thrown under the bus, the sources said.\n\n\"It's total arrogance,\" one Facebook employee said. \"Everyone is pissed.\"\n\nOn Sunday night, a Facebook spokesperson told NBC News that the leadership \"takes full responsibility for the issues we\u2019re facing.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Harriet Baskas\n\nA lot of turkey wishbones \u2013 and travel records \u2013 are set to be broken during the Thanksgiving holiday this year.\n\nAAA expects 54.3 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more away from home over the holiday, a 4.8 percent increase over last year and the highest Thanksgiving travel volume since 2005.\n\nFor the 48.5 million Americans expected to travel by car over the holiday, the best advice is: leave early. In the most congested cities, the Thanksgiving drive could take four times longer than on a \u2018normal\u2019 travel day, predicts INRIX, a mobility analytics company.\n\nTraffic at airports and in the skies will break records as well.\n\nThe 12-day Thanksgiving air travel period is already under way, and trade organization Airlines for America predicts a record 30.6 million passengers will fly on U.S. airlines.\n\nThat\u2019s up from the estimated 29 million passengers who flew during Thanksgiving last year.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 25 million people between Wednesday and Sunday, a 7 percent increase over last year.\n\nTravel tips for the airport\n\nAs with driving or going anywhere over the holiday, the key advice for flying is: leave for the airport early.\n\nThat not only helps reduce stress, but builds in extra time for all those things that can go wrong, such as discovering your favorite airport parking lot is already filled up or there\u2019s a hiccup with your airline ticket.\n\nTSA officials say new screening technologies, coupled with additional canine teams and more than 1,200 more TSA officers will help with the increased volume of passengers at airport security checkpoints this year. But there may still be long, slow-moving lines at many airports.\n\nTo make sure you\u2019re not the person holding up the line, take some extra time when prepping and packing to make sure your carry-on items are checkpoint-savvy.\n\nDress for success: Transfer small items, such as wallets, phones and keys, from your pockets to your carry-on before you get to the checkpoint.\n\nWear shoes or boots that are easy to take off and put back on.\n\nDownload and print your boarding pass. Putting your boarding pass on your mobile phone means one less paper to keep track of. But a paper version is good back-up in case your phone loses its charge while you\u2019re waiting on a long line, or if the checkpoint scanner can\u2019t read the downloaded version of your pass.\n\nReview the rules. If you\u2019re an infrequent traveler, find a quart-sized clear bag and take a moment to read TSA\u2019s primer on the liquids rule.\n\nCharge up your phone and other travel gadgets, including one or more back-up chargers, before you leave home. While airports have added more power ports, finding an empty one can still be a challenge. Show up with a power cord with extra plugs, and you\u2019ll be a hero.\n\nDownload the apps for your airline and all airports you\u2019re traveling through and sign up for the alerts for each of your flights.\n\nGet numbers. Make a list of all the phone numbers you might need for your trip. The list should include not only your airline, but also the rental car or shuttle company you\u2019ve booked with, your hotel, the person picking you up and the person who dropped you off (in case you left something behind). Put those numbers in your phone and on paper.\n\nPack extras. Bring along snacks, a hefty amount of patience, and your sense of humor. Add a stash of \u2018mad money\u2019 to your wallet. That way, if something goes wrong despite all your planning and preparation, you\u2019ll be able to buy yourself or your family a stress-busting treat.\n\nIf you\u2019re traveling with food to eat during your journey or with a turkey or something else destined for the Thanksgiving table, you will likely be asked to take it out of your bag and put it in a separate bin for a ride through the x-ray machine.\n\nTSA allows turkeys, turkey sandwiches, pies, cakes and other baked through the checkpoints, but foodstuffs that are liquid, such as jellies and cranberry sauce, need to travel in checked bags.\n\nUnsure if your food is a liquid or gel? TSA\u2019s \u201cWhat can I bring\u201d tool, available online and as an app, can help - and you can send a question about a specific item to @AskTSA on Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Ali Vitali and Adam Edelman", "title": "Florida elections supervisor targeted by Trump resigns", "description": "Snipes oversaw the contentious recount effort in Broward County during the closely watched gubernatorial and Senate races.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/brenda-snipes-florida-elections-supervisor-targeted-trump-resigns-n937921", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2651446/181119-brenda-snipes-mc-1421_c383121a81374c6300e9d3cf2b66d19c.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:51:03Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

And, in the gubernatorial race, Democrat Andrew Gillum conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis on Saturday after a machine recount.\n\nThat the recounts occurred at all, however, prompted furious criticism from Trump and other GOP officials, who made unsubstantiated allegations against Snipes of voter fraud.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Paul A. Eisenstein\n\nNissan chairman Carlos Ghosn was arrested on suspicion of under-reporting $44.6 million in pay, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office said Monday.\n\nAlso arrested was Greg Kelly, a representative director at Nissan, on suspicion of conspiracy with Ghosn.\n\nIn 1999, French automaker Renault and the Japanese automaker formed a strategic alliance. Ghosn, 64, was then sent by Renault to take over as chief operating officer of Nissan.\n\nNissan CEO Hirota Saikawa, taking the unusual step of appearing by himself in a news conference, criticized the concentration of too much power by a single individual, and offered an apology.\n\nNissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa speaks at the press conference in Yokohama, Japan, on Monday. Kyodo News via AP\n\n\"I feel strong anger and disappointment,\u201d Saikawa told reporters at Nissan headquarters in Japan. \u201cI am very sorry.\"\n\nWANT BREAKING ALERTS FROM NBC NEWS? SIGN UP HERE\n\n\"The investigation showed that over many years both Ghosn and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn's compensation,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"Numerous other significant acts of misconduct have been uncovered, such as personal use of company assets.\"\n\nThe company said it began investigating months ago, acting on a tip from a whistleblower. Even as authorities in Japan arrested the pair of executives, Nissan moved to fire Ghosn.\n\nSave for Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, few automotive executives have carved out a more high-profile presence than Ghosn who, at one point, became the star of a widely read series of comic books in Japan. But the 64-year-old executive's career now appears to be in tatters.\n\nProsecutors did not say whether either Ghosn or Kelly responded to the allegations, according to the Tokyo-based newspaper Asahi Shimbun. Nor have reports from Japan yet indicated whether the two executives are being held in custody or released.\n\nBorn in Brazil of Lebanese parents, Ghosn began his career working for the Paris-based Michelin tire company. He was recruited by Renault in 1996 and tasked with pulling the French automaker out of a steep financial slide. His radical restructuring had Renault back in the black barely a year later.\n\nBut Ghosn\u2019s biggest challenge came in 1999 when Renault decided to buy a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan. The second-largest of the Japanese automakers had run up massive amounts of debt, with only three of its many products generating profits. Nissan was considered such a basket case that former General Motors vice chairman Bob Lutz said, at the time, Renault would be better off \u201ctaking $5 billion, putting it on a barge and sinking it in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\n\nIf anything, the investment proved invaluable. Not only did Nissan quickly claw its way back into the black \u2014 earning solid margins and slashing its debt in half within three years \u2014 but it provided a lifeline for Renault when it ran into financial problems of its own a few years later.\n\nGhosn was soon elevated to CEO of the Japanese company and, subsequently, took on the same role at Renault. He also served as chief executive with the Renault-Nissan Alliance, the umbrella organization set up to coordinate operations between the two automakers. Despite their cross-ties, the two continued to function as independent companies.\n\nGhosn\u2019s penchant for deal-making continued to expand the empire. Nine years ago, the alliance entered into a partnership with Germany\u2019s Daimler AG. While there are no cross-holdings, the pairing has saved billions of dollars, Ghosn and Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche announced at a Paris news conference last month. The relationship has involved the sharing of engines and vehicle platforms, among other things, as well as the construction of an assembly plant in Mexico shared by Daimler\u2019s Mercedes brand and Nissan\u2019s Infiniti.\n\nTwo years ago, Ghosn orchestrated Nissan\u2019s purchase of a controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors, a small Japanese automaker that appeared ready to go bankrupt following a fuel-economy ratings scandal.\n\nBy combining Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi sales, the alliance claimed to be the largest automotive group in the world in 2017, though it is battling both Volkswagen AG and Toyota for the lead this year.\n\nGhosn this past year relinquished his post as CEO of Nissan, stepping back from daily operations as its new chairman. That, he explained, allowed him to focus on a turnaround at Mitsubishi as its new chief executive.\n\nBut he maintained his CEO posts at both Renault and what is now the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance. A spokesman for those Paris-based operations said a statement would be \u201cforthcoming\u201d as to Ghosn\u2019s future there.\n\nAccording to several reports from Japan, Ghosn has already been fired as a result of the scandal, but an official statement from the automaker issued on Friday from its headquarters in Yokahama stated: \u201cAs the misconduct uncovered through our internal investigation constitutes clear violations of the duty of care as directors, Nissan's Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa will propose to the Nissan Board of Directors to promptly remove Ghosn from his positions as Chairman and Representative Director.\u201d\n\nSaikawa, who succeeded Ghosn as Nissan CEO, was also expected to seek the firing of Kelly from his position as representative director.\n\nKelly, 62, started out at the automaker\u2019s big assembly plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, working in the human resources department. Kelly rose through the corporate ranks at Nissan\u2019s U.S. operations before joining Ghosn in Japan where he oversaw a number of departments, including legal, HR and communications. He officially retired from his day-to-day role in 2016 but continued in the director\u2019s post."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Keir Simmons, Kalhan Rosenblatt", "title": "Rare white lion named Mufasa faces auction block in South Africa", "description": "A rare white lion named Mufasa is likely to be auctioned off in South Africa, three years after he was confiscated from a private owner.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/rare-white-lion-named-mufasa-faces-auction-block-south-africa-n937866", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2651356/181119-mufasa-white-lion-mn-0817_b89fa26b892c05f9bba2b8833cb247a8.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:48:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Schouwstra said the government isn't interested in Soraya, however, and only wants Mufasa.\n\nSchouwstra and Zietsman are embroiled in a legal case to send Mufasa and Soraya to a sanctuary together.\n\nZietsman believes the outcry on social media and from animal activists has helped to delay the seemingly inevitable auction.\n\n\"If it hadn't been for the social media, Mufasa's head would have been on somebody's wall already,\" Zietsman said.\n\nLocal authorities did not return a request for comment made by NBC News.\n\nAnimal activists have begun raising funds online to defend Mufasa, and at least one online petition to save the lion has nearly 270,000 signatures.\n\nOther activists, like comedian Ricky Gervais, shared their disgust at the prospect of Mufasa being sold to hunters.\n\n\"Shame on the pathetic sadist who pays the money to shoot this animal, and shame on the sniveling coward who accepts the money too. Both worthless,\" Gervais tweeted.\n\nMufasa's case is reminiscent of the killing of Cecil the lion by American dentist Walter James Palmer in Zimbabwe in 2015.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The toughest results for Democrats in the 2018 midterms were the Senate contests in red states \u2014 their losses in Florida (declared on Sunday), Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota.\n\nBut with all (or almost all) of the votes now in, here\u2019s something to chew on: Going back to 2012, Democrats actually maximized their vote hauls in these four states, suggesting that their 2018 performance was their ceiling in the Trump era.\n\nTake Missouri, for instance, where Reps. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., and William Clay, D-Mo., have criticized McCaskill for not doing more to energize African-American voters. But the nearly 46 percent of the vote that McCaskill got matches what defeated Senate candidate Jason Kander took in 2016 and it exceeds Hillary Clinton\u2019s paltry 38 percent in 2016 and Barack Obama\u2019s 44 percent in 2012. The highest Democratic percentage for a federal statewide race in Missouri going back to 2012? It was McCaskill\u2019s 55 percent against the very flawed Todd Akin 2012.\n\nIn Indiana, Joe Donnelly got 45 percent of the vote \u2014 higher than Evan Bayh\u2019s 42 percent in 2016, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 37 percent in 2016 and Barack Obama\u2019s 44 percent in 2012. The highest Democratic percentage for a federal statewide race in Indiana going back to 2012? It was Donnelly\u2019s 50 percent against the very flawed Richard Mourdock in 2012.\n\nIn North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp got another 45 percent of the vote \u2014 exceeding Hillary Clinton\u2019s 27 percent in 2016 and Barack Obama\u2019s 39 percent in 2012. The highest Democratic percentage for a federal statewide race in North Dakota going to back to 2012? It was Heitkamp\u2019s 50 percent against Republican Rick Berg in 2012\n\nAnd in Florida, defeated Bill Nelson got 50 percent of the vote (he lost to Republican Rick Scott by 10,000 votes) \u2014 matching Barack Obama\u2019s 50 percent in 2012, and exceeding Hillary Clinton\u2019s 47 percent in 2016 and Patrick Murphy\u2019s 44 percent in 2016. Nelson got 55 percent of the vote against Connie Mack in 2012.\n\nBottom line: Despite any finger-pointing in Missouri, Indiana and (especially) North Dakota, the only Democrats who performed better than McCaskill, Donnelly and Heitkamp were \u2026 McCaskill, Donnelly and Heitkamp against very different candidates. Oh, and as Democratic strategist Steve Schale likes to say, Florida is always close.\n\nThe one clear exception here was in Montana, where Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., got more than 50 percent of the vote in his race against Matt Rosendale \u2014 up from his 49 percent winning percentage in 2012, while Clinton got 35 percent in 2016 and Obama got 42 percent.\n\nSo good candidates matter. So do bad opponents.\n\nFlorida\n\nNelson in 2018: 50 percent\n\nMurphy in 2016: 44 percent\n\nClinton in 2016: 47 percent\n\nNelson in 2012: 55 percent\n\nObama in 2012: 50 percent\n\nIndiana\n\nDonnelly in 2018: 45 percent\n\nBayh in 2016: 42 percent\n\nClinton in 2016: 37 percent\n\nDonnelly in 2012: 50 percent\n\nObama in 2012: 44 percent\n\nMissouri\n\nMcCaskill in 2018: 46 percent\n\nKander in 2016: 46 percent\n\nClinton in 2016: 38 percent\n\nMcCaskill in 2012: 55 percent\n\nObama in 2012: 44 percent\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nHeitkamp in 2018: 45 percent\n\nClinton in 2016: 27 percent\n\nHeitkamp in 2012: 50 percent\n\nObama in 2012: 39 percent\n\nThe uncalled Senate races (zero)\n\n\u2014 FL-SEN (Rick Scott defeated Bill Nelson by 10,033 votes)\n\n(MS-SEN goes to runoff)\n\nRepublicans ended up with a net gain of at least two Senate seats.\n\nThe uncalled GOV races (zero)\n\n\u2014 GA-GOV (NBC News declared Republican Brian Kemp the apparent winner)\n\nDemocrats ended up with a net gain of seven governorships.\n\nThe uncalled House races (three)\n\nGA-7 (Republican Rob Woodall is ahead, 50.1 percent to 49.9 percent)\n\nNM-2 (NBC News retracted its earlier call in favor of the Republicans; Dem Xochitl Torres Small is ahead, 51 percent to 49 percent)\n\nUT-4 (Republican Mia Love is ahead of Democrat Ben McAdams, 50.1 percent to 49.9 percent)\n\n\u2014 CA-39 (NBC News called Democrat Gil Cisneros the apparent winner)\n\n\u2014 CA-45 (NBC News called Democrat Katie Porter the apparent winner)\n\n\u2014 NC-9 (NBC News declared Republican Mark Harris the apparent winner)\n\nDemocrats currently have a net gain of 37 House seats \u2014 and counting.\n\nAnother controversy-filled weekend for Trump\n\nPresident Donald Trump had, um, an interesting weekend. Consider:\n\nHe referred to the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee with a misspelled expletive. \u201cSo funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!\u201d the president tweeted yesterday.\n\nHe attacked retired Admiral William Raven. \u201cOK, he's a Hilary Clinton backer and an Obama backer and frankly would it have been nicer if we got Osama Bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn't it been nice?\u201d Trump said on Fox. (In fact, McRaven wasn\u2019t a supporter of Clinton\u2019s or Obama\u2019s, and he commanded the operations that captured bin Laden.)\n\nHe insisted he didn\u2019t want to see the apparent videotape showing the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. \u201cWe have the tape, I don't want to hear the tape, no reason for me to hear the tape. Because it's a suffering tape, it's a terrible tape. I've been fully briefed on it. There's no reason for me to hear it,\u201d Trump said on Fox.\n\nWhen visiting areas devastated by fires in California, Trump mistakenly referred to Paradise, California, as \u201cPleasure.\"\n\nAnd he seemed to suggest that raking leaves could have prevented California\u2019s fires. \u201cTrump told reporters on Saturday that he had recently been talking to the president of Finland,\u201d the Washington Post writes. \u201c\u2018He called it a forest nation,\u2019 Trump said, referring to Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, \u2018and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don\u2019t have any problem.\u2019\u201d\n\nNo, Republicans didn\u2019t 'steal' Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial election\n\nOn \u201cMeet the Press\u201d yesterday, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, didn\u2019t back away from this earlier remark: \u201cIf Stacey Abrams doesn't win in Georgia, they stole it. It's clear. It's clear. And I would say, I say that publicly. It's clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think you look at the lead-up to this election as secretary of state \u2014 and I was the secretary of state in Ohio 30 years ago. I know what you do, as secretary of state. You encourage people to vote. You don't purge millions of voters. You don't close down polling places in rural areas where voters have difficulty getting to the polls, which were mostly low-income areas. You don't do what Republicans are doing all over the country,\u201d Brown said yesterday.\n\nBut as election-law expert Rick Hasen writes, voter suppression isn\u2019t the same thing as stealing an election. \u201cDemocrats should stop with the rhetoric that the race was \u2018stolen,\u2019 ... First, rhetoric about stolen elections feeds a growing cycle of mistrust and delegitimization of the election process ... Saying Kemp tried to suppress Democratic votes and saying the election was stolen are two different things, and making charges of a stolen election when it cannot be proved undermines Democrats\u2019 complaints about suppressive tactics ... Rather than questioning the election\u2019s legitimacy or making unprovable claims of stolen elections, Democrats should focus their efforts into doing whatever is possible to prevent voter suppression and incompetence in the upcoming 2020 elections.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "First Read's Morning Clips: Dem wave takes out Orange County", "description": "A roundup of the most important political news stories of the day", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-s-morning-clips-dem-wave-takes-out-orange-n937881", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_45/2635511/ss-181106-voting-mn-16_399c70e4492b687996b801a10fd88e03.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:41:15Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The rebels say they had been excluded from that government and took power to rectify historic grievances against central authority.\n\nThe rebel leader, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said in a statement to journalists that the Iran-backed rebels ordered the cessation of rocket and drone attacks on the Saudis and forces loyal to coalition member the United Arab Emirates at the request of U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths.\n\n\"We are ready to freeze and stop military operations on all fronts in order to achieve peace,\" al-Houthi said, mentioning the rockets specifically as part of a longer statement in which he blamed the United States for being the main driver for what he called \"the aggression\" against Yemen.\n\nMohammed Ali al-Huthi. Mohamed Huwais / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nYemen's civil war began in the wake of its Arab Spring uprising, when the Houthis swept down from their northern stronghold and took the capital, Sanaa, in 2014, with the help of troops loyal to Yemen's former strongman, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The government fled the following year, and Saudi Arabia, citing fears that its nemesis Iran was using the Shiite leanings of the revolt to make inroads on the Arabian Peninsula, began launching airstrikes against the rebels.\n\nRiyadh formed a coalition of Sunni Arab states, including the UAE, Kuwait, Egypt and Sudan, and launched ground assaults on several fronts but failed to take the capital. After some major setbacks, it began outsourcing the ground fighting to local troops, including a group trained by the UAE in the south.\n\nThe latest Saudi-led offensive, which began last summer, has been focused on capturing the key rebel-held port city of Hodeida, through which almost all of Yemen's food and desperately needed humanitarian aid flows.\n\nGriffiths, the U.N. envoy, announced on Friday that both sides had agreed to attend talks in Sweden \"soon\" aimed at ending the conflict.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Nicholas Kusnetz, InsideClimate News\n\nThis article has been jointly published by NBCNews.com and InsideClimate News, a nonprofit, independent news outlet that covers climate, energy and the environment.\n\nPORTSMOUTH, Va. \u2014 At the foot of the Chesapeake Bay in southeast Virginia lies a Naval shipyard older than the nation itself. One of the country\u2019s first warships was built here in 1799. So was the first battleship, and decades later the first aircraft carrier.\n\nOver the past three centuries, Norfolk Naval Shipyard has been blockaded and burned to the ground, only to be rebuilt again and again. Today, it\u2019s one of four Navy shipyards that maintain the nation\u2019s nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers, which enable the Pentagon to respond quickly to military and humanitarian crises across the globe.\n\nBut the shipyard now faces its greatest existential threat: rising seas and extreme weather driven by climate change.\n\nIn the past 10 years, Norfolk Naval Shipyard has suffered nine major floods that have damaged equipment used to repair ships, and the flooding is worsening, according to the Navy. In 2016, rain from Hurricane Matthew left 2 feet of water in one building, requiring nearly $1.2 million in repairs.\n\nThe Norfolk Naval Shipyard lies at the foot of Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t even a direct hit \u2014 the most immediate worry, former military leaders say, is a strong storm that blows right through the area.\n\n\u201cIt would have the potential for serious, if not catastrophic damage, and it would certainly put the shipyard out of business for some amount of time,\u201d said Ray Mabus, who was the Navy secretary under President Barack Obama. \u201cThat has implications not just for the shipyard, but for us, for the Navy.\u201d\n\nAmong the shipyard\u2019s greatest vulnerabilities are its five dry docks, which are waterside basins that can be sealed and pumped dry to expose a ship\u2019s hull for repairs. Once inside, vessels are often cut open, leaving expensive mechanical systems vulnerable to damage from storms and flooding.\n\nDry Dock 12 in Newport News, Virginia, is flooded to float the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford before its commissioning in 2013. Joshua J. Wahl / U.S. Navy\n\nThe dry docks \u201cwere not designed to accommodate the threats\u201d of rising seas and stronger storms, according to a 2017 report by the Government Accountability Office. Navy officials warned the government watchdog agency that flooding in a dry dock could cause \u201ccatastrophic damage to the ships.\u201d\n\nAlready, high-tide flooding is contributing to extensive delays in ship repairs, the GAO said, disrupting maintenance schedules throughout the Navy\u2019s fleet. Sea level in Norfolk has risen 1.5 feet in the past century, twice the global average, in part because the coastline is sinking.\n\nThe Navy has erected temporary flood walls and uses thousands of sandbags to protect the dry docks at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. The Navy has also begun elevating some equipment, but the facility remains vulnerable, according to a Defense Department survey on the effects of extreme weather on military bases, obtained through a public records request. In response, the Navy proposed a more permanent barrier estimated to cost more than $30 million, part of a 20-year, $21 billion plan submitted to Congress this year to modernize Norfolk as well as Navy shipyards in Maine, Washington and Hawaii.\n\nBut the new projects have yet to be approved.\n\nThe Navy said it takes extensive measures to limit damage from flooding. \u201cThese requirements ensure the safety of our personnel, our ships (nuclear and non-nuclear), and shipyard infrastructure,\" William M. Couch, a Navy spokesman, said in an email."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Embezzlement claims trigger protests across Haiti; 6 dead", "description": "Demonstrators want a probe into the spending of $3.8 billion Haiti received as part of a Venezuelan program that provided the country with subsidized oil.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/haiti-anti-corruption-protests-spark-clashes-6-dead-n937821", "urlToImage": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/3443612/1000x563_3443612.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T08:19:48Z", "content": "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti Six people were killed and at least five others were wounded Sunday during demonstrations across Haiti protesting allegations of embezzlement from a Venezuelan program that provided the country with subsidized oil, police said.

As of Sunday night, the fire was 65 percent contained and firefighters expect it to be fully extinguished only by the end of the month. With more than 10,300 homes destroyed, search and rescue teams have arrived to comb through the debris looking for victims.\n\n\"I woke up the next morning, and they talked about how devastating it was,\" Hilscher said Sunday. \"I sat around for about 30 minutes and thought about what we could do to help.\"\n\nHilscher, 37, owns the Sexy Panda Food Truck, which sells Asian-themed street food in Sacramento, the state capital.

They've been going 24-7 ever since, handing out supplies and serving thousands of meals a day to victims of the fire from the parking lot of a Walmart, Hilscher said.\n\n\"It's started to grow into its own animal.

The demonstrators sang the Mexican national anthem and waved flags as they urged the migrants to go home.\n\nThe protesters said they had no problem with legal immigration, but they were strongly opposed to what they called an \"illegal invasion.\"\n\nSome protesters said the Mexican government should follow President Donald Trump\u2019s lead and adopt tougher border policies.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s defending his border, unlike our president,\u201d said protester Elvia Vijeras. \u201cNow there will be more violence in Tijuana.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum called the influx of migrants an \u201cavalanche\u201d that could wind up staying in the city for at least six months.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump tweeted about Gastelum saying the city was \u201cill-prepared\u201d for the migrants.\n\n\u201cLikewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\u201d\n\nSome protesters said they had previously disagreed with Trump on issues \u2014 but not this one.\n\nRoy Grant, who lives in Tijuana and works in San Diego, said he fears any mass demonstrations by the migrants could end up shutting down the San Ysidro Port of Entry.\n\n\u201cI think these migrants need to go back to their country,\u201d Grant said. \u201cMexico needs to take a very aggressive, hands-on approach and deport them.\u201d\n\nGrant said he found himself an an unlikely supporter of Trump's hard-line position on immigration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how he says it, not what he says, that\u2019s offensive to people,\u201d Grant said.\n\nAbout 10,000 people are making their way through Mexico in at least three separate caravans. The first began in early October in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Since then, the groups of migrants have walked, taken buses or hitched rides on any vehicle they could find as they made the grueling trek north with the intent to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nMany have said they are fleeing violence and poverty in their home country and that they travel together in the belief that there's safety in numbers as they make the treacherous journey.\n\nTrump seized on the issues of immigration and the caravans before the midterm elections, calling the migrant groups \u201can invasion\u201d and using them to rally his supporters. He also deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the southern border.\n\nFrancis Belmontes, who brought his two children to the protest, said his seven-year-old daughter told him that some of the migrants were urinating outside of her school and asking for money.\n\nHe said not all the migrants were mothers seeking a better life for their children, and he had seen young men with tattoos who he believed were gang members. He said he worried for his children\u2019s safety.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re sounding like Trump\u2019s America here in Mexico.\u201d\n\nBelmontes said he wasn\u2019t sure what the migrants expected once they got to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cThey chose the wrong time to get asylum,\u201d Belmontes said. \u201c(Trump) clearly doesn\u2019t want them there.\u201d"}]
